    Hello readers, I am back with another review, this time about one of the most controversial super-hero movies of all time, BATMAN RETURNS. The film opens with a young penguin being thrown into the sewer by his hateful parents. This calls for Danny Elfman's new musical score to come in. Already I can see how dark this film is going to be than the previous. The reason of this is that Tim Burton had the freedom to make a Batman film the way he liked it which makes for a bizarre and Gothic entry... due to the great success of the first installment that is. So the film then proceeds with an awesome action scene where Batman returns. Then we get a scene with Max Shrek confronting the Penguin played by Danny DeVito who is so freaky and compelling in this film. I always wondered, who the hell taught The Penguin how to talk? The scene is quite scary and now we are finally assured that we are in for one hell of "BURTON" type film. Why didn't he just make another film with this kind of style, why do it to poor Batman? Anyway Max Shrek throws Selina Kyle out of a window and when she lays on the ground a pack of cats start well ravaging her until she comes too in a frightening scene. We then get a scene of Selina loosing her mind thus becoming the film's second villain, Catwoman. The rest of the film drags with fake action scenes and bizarre confrontations. They film becomes very un-enjoyable during the half way point and just becomes ultimately weird. I mean look at all these scenes, there's the bit when Penguin bites this guys nose, Penguin eats a raw fish, Catwoman and Batman get all frisky and it just seems to be more of a BEETLE JUICE film than a Batman film. I mean seriously Tim, why not just make your own bloody movie! Why just completely weird-out the Batman series and thus create Batman Forever! Along with the just as bad Batman And Robin. After a mind bendingly stupid plan by The Penguin we reach the final battle which features a pretty cool scene with Michael Keaton turning around to see the helpless Penguin as sparks pop behind him. So the film finishes with a mystery which leaves me hoping for another Burton film which was never made due to parents, believe it or not! That's your fault for making it all dark and weird Tim! And, yeah the film is OK and with no doubt isn't as bad as most claim but here ends my review for Batman Returns, the wonderfully different entry to the Batman legacy. See you soon for further reviews or you can check out my previous ones...

    Equally magnificent sequel has Michael Keaton returning as Bruce Wayne/Batman, only here is opposed by the double threat of Catwoman(marvelously played by the sultry Michele Pfeiffer) who starts off as harried secretary Selina Kyle, who is transformed into Catwoman after a betrayal. They develop a close relationship, since they both have a great deal in common... Danny DeVito portrays Oswald Cobblepot/the Penquin, who was a deformed child brought up in the sewers of Gotham, and now heads a criminal gang. DeVito effectively plays the pathos of this man, who can't decide if he wants to re-enter society or not, but a dramatic turn-of-events pushes him over the edge... Filled with fantastic action, set design, and music score, this production is another triumph, one of the few sequels to match the original, even though some feel it is too dark, the subject matter suits this. A great pity that star Michael Keaton and director Tim Burton stopped here, and didn't get the chance to do a trilogy, since the new team drove this series off the rails...A shame that.

    This is one of those movies that's going to affect your opinion of it in weird ways, the more you think of it. For some this is a movie that got better with time, and for many others it only had gotten worse. Unfortunately the latter has happened for me, and to be honest there was a time when I gave it at least a 7, because I thought as a Tim Burton movie, and not a Batman movie, it succeeded, but then I re-visited it to only find that it's more a carbon copy of one of his past works. That movie is possibly his most critically acclaimed movie Edward Scissorhands, which is actually good on its own merits, but it's not necessarily a movie that can be redone to great success. Why I say this about Returns is that right from the get go we as viewers don't feel like we're in Gotham anymore, but really just this small claustrophobic set, that doesn't feel quite as large as the Gotham seen in the first movie, but more let the sets to Scissorhands which also had an ironic Christmas setting. Notably the most obvious parallel, other than the whole Christmas setting, is that Edward and Oswald 'The Penguin' have the same makeup job. Another thing the two have in common that Burton has been doing for awhile now is that he always feels the need to have outcasts in his stories, that he wants you to feel sad for, which for a sympathetic character like Edward you would, but with characters such as The Penguin who are just naturally sick, twisted, and villainous, you really don't. The story for this doesn't have one narrative form to stick to, therefore the story itself really doesn't seem to know which character is really the protagonist. It should be Batman, but even much more so than in the original one he's so hidden from the audience that it's hard to care for many of the things that happen to him. What fascinates me, is when they present an interesting idea for him to get involved in, it chooses to not have enough focus on that. What I mostly refer to is his relationship with Selina/Catwoman, having a character that has similar qualities to the hero can make for a very interesting love relationship, but as you see in the movie they really only give the Bruce/Selina aspect 2-3 small scenes to do it justice, and her Catwoman facet is hard to read, as she seemingly tries seducing Batman to get the better of him not to find a relationship in him, leaving another plot thread that could've had further development through that side of it, but in the end resorts to it just feeling very unfinished. Now Michelle Pfeiffer's performance overall is okay, it's just that I really couldn't take her seriously as a character, which is ironic considering that she's probably the only character with an emotional arc in it. I think the reason why is that despite Burton trying to go for a somewhat darker tone, he still put in lots of silly, campy, cartoon humor that somewhat makes some of the performances like Michelle's feels unbalanced, because they ask us to care about an emotional arc that she has that kind of gets suffocated in the paraphernalia of the character, and the same goes for Danny as the Penguin. Tim Burton has recently stated that he now feels that his Batman movies look like lighthearted romps these days, and I can definitely see why he said that. I'm not implying that there shouldn't be any humor in it, but don't put so much in it that it feels forced. For me, and I think many others, the best thing to come out of this movie was the Danny Elfman score, a composer that's consistently coming up with great musical ideas for whatever movie he works on. Another positive thing about the movie that I can say is that even though the character of Max Schreck is written uninteresting, Christopher Walken makes it interesting by just being there, playing himself almost. I would compliment the visuals as being inspired, but now that I've revisited the movie, I can say that it's stuff borrowed from Burton's movie before this Edward Scissorhands, and I'd also add that visuals don't have much of a meaning without a meaningful story. ****

    Usually doing a second film no matter what the genre is. Is a good thing. It takes it to another level. My experience with Batman Returns was still pretty good. But not as enjoyable than the first film that was made in (1989). Michael Keaton returns to the franchise. I definitely think he's the best Batman of all time. George Clooney sucked. And whoever else played him was awful. This was a terrific choice for an actor. All of the special effects can get a little goofy at times. It has some intense scenes though. In my opinion this film is for kids age: 12 and up. So I give this movie a thumbs up. The first film gets two thumbs up. It was amazing. This one wasn't amazing. But it did continue the story in a nice way. The style of the camera shots were good. The close ups were nice. And overall the film did have its moments. So it's not awful. If you're a true Batman fan see it.

    First of all, and I think you would agree, that the second movie off any film is not as good as the first one. With Batman returns this was the case. Not great, but still good. Keaton still makes a good batman. The bat suite was tampered with a little bit but it mostly looks the same. But yet again the story of how the villain became a villain was told. Not how batman was created. This time two villains had risen, the penguin and cat-woman. The penguin was a bit overdone for my liking, his huge nose, three fingers on each hand, funny shaped body and hi even living with penguins! Gosh I wonder what they were trying to say? Is he maybe half penguin? Still Danny deVito played it well. Catwoman is a bit far-fetched. She was really made from the likes of cats.not better than batman, but surely worth having a look

    People are going to think I'm crazy, but I actually like this film is better than the previous, even better than most of Christopher Nolan's franchise. This is probably where the Batman series got to its darkest. I'm not just saying that due to the Gothic setting and down-beat atmosphere, but also because of the tension that builds between each of the main characters. The Bat, the Cat, and the Penguin are trying to identify themselves among everyone else in their lives. The film portrays this intensity by showing they are more connected than they realize. To me, the film, in its own right, is a masterpiece. There is fantastic acting, beautiful imagery, interesting plots and even an incredible soundtrack by Danny Elfman. This was, unfortunately, the last Batman film with Tim Burton as director. Fans then had to see the horrors of... well... just read my review for Batman Forever.

    Ah, heres a movie I remember fondly from my childhood. Man I had it all, the toys, the McDonald's happy meal toys (not to mention those cool large plastic McDonald's cups my mom bought me) the sega video game, the trading cards, the t shirts, the batmobile candy dispensers, all kinds of neat merch based on the movie. of course in retrospect, this is not at all a kids movie, despite the fact its batman and was aimed at kids who bought happy meals. but that doesn't mean its not a great movie. not every superhero movie has to cater strictly to the kids. nevertheless, my 6 year old self was too in love with batman to care about how dark it was, I still loved anything and everything having to do with my favorite superhero and I must have watched this movie, along with the other 2 movies (1989 batman and batman forever) a zillion times on video. here's the premise. Batman truly does Return in this sequel to the 1989 mega hit, and this time hes better then ever. hes got some new toys (like the electronic self-targeting Baterang), vehicles and even has 2 new classic villains to contend with. penguin is a classic Tim Burton character in this one, but that can only be a good thing. in this movie, Burton makes the characters very ambiguous. is the penguin really half animal, half human? is cat woman part cat, part woman? these questions never really get answered. personally, i don't believe they are part animal at all. the penguin is all human albeit a VERY deformed and ugly one, and is only called Penguin because of his deformities. Catwoman is always human but the whole "9 lives" thing makes it ambiguous whether she has supernatural powers or whether shes just very lucky. its debatable. Batman is the only normal guy in this. in fact, Keaton being the calm cool hero both as Bruce Wayne and batman, grounds the movie and keeps it together whereas the 2 villains are completely crazy and psychotic nut cases. it seemed Keaton didn't have it all together in the last movie, he had a a lot of demons to fight with, but by the end you got the feeling he found his purpose in life, now that hes got a bat-signal and the law on his side. so naturally, in this one he seems more together and knows what hes doing. its the villains who are not together and have all these obvious mental problems, so much so that they actually make batman look normal. if it was anyone else playing batman, it wouldn't have worked. but Michael Keaton has a unique screen presence that when he puts on the bat suit, he literally IS batman and lets face it, no one before or since has had the manly swagger that Michael Keaton had as batman. he was a bit older, getting some greys, was this sort of gruff everyman but has this seriousness and "normal guy" look that makes you take him seriously as batman. other actors who have played batman seem too pretty boy or hand picked and thus don't feel real. Keaton is like the everyman normal looking 40 year old gruff guy and he demands you take him seriously. this is a very artsy film, compared to its blockbuster brother from 1989, which was basically a cut-&-dry blockbuster action/adventure. but it really didn't have any emotion or depth to it, despite Keaton's sincere efforts. Thats where Returns comes in. all the characters are very interesting and in a way, they all echo Batman. Catwoman is the dark vigilante side of him, while the Penguin shows what Bruce Wayne could have been if he turned bitter against the world. I've heard many ppl say that this batman film is not really about Batman himself, and that too much attention is given to the villains, but i will say again, its not a bad thing, and doesn't ruin this film. batman himself is really not a very interesting character when you think about it. hes essentially a guy who's see's his parents get killed as a kid, he trains for X years, then decides to becomes batman for revenge purposes. OK. thats it. there's no more to it really. certainly not something i want to watch for a whole 2 hours. i really didn't see a point in making a whole movie about his origin a couple years ago, i think it was a waste. i was always kinda hoping they would bring back the Burton style of filmaking for batman movies, or maybe even get Burton back to direct. but alas, we got something that felt like a lesser version of the 1989 film. sad. but hey, we always have the Tim Burton films to enjoy. those, IMO, captured the real batman, beyond the facade of "comic book" movie looks (which, in Burton's case, is actually a good thing). as far as i'm concerned, Burton is the only guy to have directed Batman movies. hes the only one who i believed truly understood batman, as you can see in his various films. the other directors never really...got it. they just don't get batman. they only got him as a character, thats it. but Burton KNEW batman, he understood his plight in life, and the darkness inherent in the material. thats why this is to me, the best, and most personal, Batman film. it shows batman, and his villains, at there most raw. they are all hurt individuals, and thats what makes this film so powerful. this is what a batman film should be. serious, witty, playful, phycological, and DARK. while still retaining the comic book style that we all expect. this film also paved the way for the wonderful Batman: The Animated Series, which also shares Tim Burton's dark, Gothic look and feel from both of his Batman films. it even uses the same theme!

    My friends will know I have a mixed opinion of Nolans batman films. Begins was dull, TDK was pretty cool and TDKR....well, we have batman and robin to contend with worst batman movie. I say this as my friends say "the old films are to light hearted" I reply "Go watch batman returns" This film takes influences both from Batman and Burton's film he made just before this, Edward Scissorhands. The latter was Burton's personal favourite film, and for this film, he wanted to bring something new to the table. Batman returns has the Gothic, almost fairy tale like feel of Scissorhands-a dark, twisted fairy tale anyway. This is due to impressive production design, and Danny Elfmans score, which has the choir elements added in for that Burton feel. Keaton returns and once again impresses as batman. He isn't in that much (more than in TDKR though) but he brings a real pressence on screen. He is in my eyes the true Batman. Danny DeVito is the warped penguin and he is a very interesting, if vile, character. A great costume and make up team make him a great villain. Although he is not the crime boss from the comics, the abandoned mutant makes him a more sympathetic villain- only Aaron Eckhart is more sympathetic than penguin in the batman films. Michelle Pfeiffer is the scene stealer here as catwomen. Her demented take on the anti hero is very engaging and she has one of the coolest costumes ever. Finally Christopher Walken appears as corrupt tycoon Max Schrek. He is basically playing himself-which is awesome, as he is Christopher Walken. So we have a strong cast-what about the story? While it's morbid and dark, it's very interesting. Its complex and not realistic but is very powerful-but not uplifting. As for the production, Gotham looks as dark as it will ever look-its mostly set at night. Its a memroble setting, but not comic book-y-more Tim Burton-y. The music gets the tone of the film across very well-Danny Elfman has composed a real gem here. The action however is a bit lackluster-the music holds it together, making it seem more exciting. The biggest problem the film has is that its not a comic book movie-it does change the villains backstories, batman is slightly to immoral and the story doesn't have the simple plots or action to make it a comic book movie. Although its not the best representation of batman or comic book movies, and a disappointment compared to its predecessor, its a great watch if your into the dark worlds of Tim Burton-defiantly the dark knights darkest hour.

    I'll go ahead and say it, Batman Returns is my favorite Batman movie. As much as I love Nolan's Batman films such like 2008's Dark Knight for making more sense and realistic. I like how fun Batman Returns is. Yes, it's campy, creepy, and the plot makes little to no sense, still it's a lot of fun for me. Don't get me wrong, Nolan's films are superior movies over Tim Burton's mediocre films, but there is something about Batman Returns that get me watching all the time when it's on, TV. I think it's because it's feels like a creepy comic book movie. For me, this isn't supposed to be remotely realistic, this is a straight up fantasy. It has that old school horror movie feel to it. I love the Danny Elfman score, the cinematography, the set design, the ghoulish and semi-camp German Expressionism tone. I can see why it was too frightening for children to the point that parents got rid of the Batman Returns Happy Meals and didn't allow the kids to watch it. There were serious WTF moments in the film that pretty damn dark like Penguin (Danny Devito) eating a man's nose, a baby being abandon, sexually depraved dialogues between the Penguin and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and countless deaths. But seriously did any of these children ever see The Dark Knight? I have to say that, pretty scary and violence as well. Honestly, it's the parent's choice to allow their kids to watch it or not. Thank God, my parents allow me to see it because it's the film that made me a fan of Batman. This movie is messy, nonsensical and heavily flawed and I still love it. The movie starts out Penguin being abandoned by his parents because of his physical deformities when a child, he then tries to rejoin humanity with the help of a businessmen Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who then uses him as a part of his plot to allow his business to continue to operate free from government oversight by asking him to become mayor after the city start to sympathize him for what his parents did to him. What the film does wrong, is make him a villain outright without much character development. Rather than getting abused and tossed aside just at the moment when he almost begins to believe that perhaps he is capable of being respected and that people may not be so bad, the film makes him deranged, terrorist and the monstrous psychopath bear little resemblance to the savvy, anti-heroic thief or the neutral informant businessman of the comics. If only they had the betrayal by the city folks drives him insane and he tries to destroy the society that spurned and abused him would make an excellent movie rather than Penguin looking like a monster dimwit with his multiplies fails plots like getting revenge on Gotham socialites by abducting and killing their infant or blowing the city with penguin carrying missiles. As much as I like Christopher Walken and his President Andrew Jackson's hairdo, the story could have done without his character. I know Shreck is the bad-guy of the film that needed to put Selena on her quest for revenge and track towards insanity. You can easier fit Penguin in that role. The best part of the film is the conflict & romance of Selena and Bruce that should had been the main focal point of the film. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) and Selina Kyle. Pfeiffer and Keaton both give great performances, and their on-screen chemistry is excellent. If the main focus had been on developing their relationship it would have been a great movie. As it is, just a handful of short scenes together simply didn't cut it. The sequence with Bruce and Selena at the party was the best scene in the film. The conflict and chemistry between the two draws you in, especially when watching Selena's own problems with mounting insanity. Still, don't know how she became a master of kung-fu. I love Michelle's catwoman more than Anna Hatchaway in 2012's Dark Knight's Rises. As much as I love Michelle, Anne Hathaway comes the closest to portraying Catwoman from the comics as far as the movies goes. Still, Michael Keaton was the best Batman. The mischaracterizations of Batman from the first film are carried over and amplified here. Batman is murderous, and remorseless. True, Batman originally carried a gun and killed, but that aspect of the character didn't survive the first year of an 80+ year run, and is not really a valid interpretation of the character anymore. Batman doesn't murder people. Thank God, Marlon Wayans wasn't portraying Robin and Robin was cut out. The inconsistent tone of the film also works against it. Burton presents a very bleak, grim, nihilistic serious story, where the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are monsters. He them loads the film with absurdist camp set pieces, but plays them straight and seems to expect the audience to take them seriously. This causes the tone to shift wildly, and the audience ends up laughing at things meant to be taken seriously and taking jokes at face value. Artistic license is one thing, but these characters got the worst of the Burton treatment, and both characters suffer for it in a major way. Overall: I agree Batman Returns had flaws. Batman Return has a somber tone punctuated with ridiculousness, but it's watchable. I can't say the same with its follow ups: 1995's Batman Forever and 1997's Batman & Robin. Those movies nearly ruin batman until Nolan step in with 2005's Batman Begins. Still, glad Tim Burton didn't made another Batman after this.

    Batman Returns was a major disappointment to me. When I saw the first Batman in this series, I loved it (mostly due to Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker). The thing about these original Batman movies is that they put the majority of the focus on the villains. The Joker was a complete show maker in the last one, but this one includes Danny DeVito as the Penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman. While both actors did a good job, the two different stories of the Penguin and Cat Woman did not make a good combination. The Penguins story was depressing which added gloom to the story, and Cat Woman's story was disturbing which added darkness to the story. Put them together and you have a movie that's disturbingly depressing (or Depressingly Disturbing which ever you prefer.) Batman himself was played for the last time by Michael Keaton. A lot of people were mad when Keaton didn't return in the last two films for this series but personally I was OK with it. It's not that I think that he's a bad actor, as much as I think that he wasn't a convincing Batman (he doesn't look the part for starters). The rest of the acting was good. Particularly Christopher Walken as Max. He did a great job. I just don't think that a movie that doubles up on negative emotions is a good way to get buyers. And so thus, after one successful movie, the Batman franchise began to fail.

    Equally magnificent sequel has Michael Keaton returning as Bruce Wayne/Batman, only here is opposed by the double threat of Catwoman(marvelously played by the sultry Michele Pfeiffer) who starts off as harried secretary Selina Kyle, who is transformed into Catwoman after a betrayal. They develop a close relationship, since they both have a great deal in common... Danny DeVito portrays Oswald Cobblepot/the Penquin, who was a deformed child brought up in the sewers of Gotham, and now heads a criminal gang. DeVito effectively plays the pathos of this man, who can't decide if he wants to re-enter society or not, but a dramatic turn-of-events pushes him over the edge... Filled with fantastic action, set design, and music score, this production is another triumph, one of the few sequels to match the original, even though some feel it is too dark, the subject matter suits this. A great pity that star Michael Keaton and director Tim Burton stopped here, and didn't get the chance to do a trilogy, since the new team drove this series off the rails...A shame that.

    This is one of those movies that's going to affect your opinion of it in weird ways, the more you think of it. For some this is a movie that got better with time, and for many others it only had gotten worse. Unfortunately the latter has happened for me, and to be honest there was a time when I gave it at least a 7, because I thought as a Tim Burton movie, and not a Batman movie, it succeeded, but then I re-visited it to only find that it's more a carbon copy of one of his past works. That movie is possibly his most critically acclaimed movie Edward Scissorhands, which is actually good on its own merits, but it's not necessarily a movie that can be redone to great success. Why I say this about Returns is that right from the get go we as viewers don't feel like we're in Gotham anymore, but really just this small claustrophobic set, that doesn't feel quite as large as the Gotham seen in the first movie, but more let the sets to Scissorhands which also had an ironic Christmas setting. Notably the most obvious parallel, other than the whole Christmas setting, is that Edward and Oswald 'The Penguin' have the same makeup job. Another thing the two have in common that Burton has been doing for awhile now is that he always feels the need to have outcasts in his stories, that he wants you to feel sad for, which for a sympathetic character like Edward you would, but with characters such as The Penguin who are just naturally sick, twisted, and villainous, you really don't. The story for this doesn't have one narrative form to stick to, therefore the story itself really doesn't seem to know which character is really the protagonist. It should be Batman, but even much more so than in the original one he's so hidden from the audience that it's hard to care for many of the things that happen to him. What fascinates me, is when they present an interesting idea for him to get involved in, it chooses to not have enough focus on that. What I mostly refer to is his relationship with Selina/Catwoman, having a character that has similar qualities to the hero can make for a very interesting love relationship, but as you see in the movie they really only give the Bruce/Selina aspect 2-3 small scenes to do it justice, and her Catwoman facet is hard to read, as she seemingly tries seducing Batman to get the better of him not to find a relationship in him, leaving another plot thread that could've had further development through that side of it, but in the end resorts to it just feeling very unfinished. Now Michelle Pfeiffer's performance overall is okay, it's just that I really couldn't take her seriously as a character, which is ironic considering that she's probably the only character with an emotional arc in it. I think the reason why is that despite Burton trying to go for a somewhat darker tone, he still put in lots of silly, campy, cartoon humor that somewhat makes some of the performances like Michelle's feels unbalanced, because they ask us to care about an emotional arc that she has that kind of gets suffocated in the paraphernalia of the character, and the same goes for Danny as the Penguin. Tim Burton has recently stated that he now feels that his Batman movies look like lighthearted romps these days, and I can definitely see why he said that. I'm not implying that there shouldn't be any humor in it, but don't put so much in it that it feels forced. For me, and I think many others, the best thing to come out of this movie was the Danny Elfman score, a composer that's consistently coming up with great musical ideas for whatever movie he works on. Another positive thing about the movie that I can say is that even though the character of Max Schreck is written uninteresting, Christopher Walken makes it interesting by just being there, playing himself almost. I would compliment the visuals as being inspired, but now that I've revisited the movie, I can say that it's stuff borrowed from Burton's movie before this Edward Scissorhands, and I'd also add that visuals don't have much of a meaning without a meaningful story. ****

    Usually doing a second film no matter what the genre is. Is a good thing. It takes it to another level. My experience with Batman Returns was still pretty good. But not as enjoyable than the first film that was made in (1989). Michael Keaton returns to the franchise. I definitely think he's the best Batman of all time. George Clooney sucked. And whoever else played him was awful. This was a terrific choice for an actor. All of the special effects can get a little goofy at times. It has some intense scenes though. In my opinion this film is for kids age: 12 and up. So I give this movie a thumbs up. The first film gets two thumbs up. It was amazing. This one wasn't amazing. But it did continue the story in a nice way. The style of the camera shots were good. The close ups were nice. And overall the film did have its moments. So it's not awful. If you're a true Batman fan see it.

    First of all, and I think you would agree, that the second movie off any film is not as good as the first one. With Batman returns this was the case. Not great, but still good. Keaton still makes a good batman. The bat suite was tampered with a little bit but it mostly looks the same. But yet again the story of how the villain became a villain was told. Not how batman was created. This time two villains had risen, the penguin and cat-woman. The penguin was a bit overdone for my liking, his huge nose, three fingers on each hand, funny shaped body and hi even living with penguins! Gosh I wonder what they were trying to say? Is he maybe half penguin? Still Danny deVito played it well. Catwoman is a bit far-fetched. She was really made from the likes of cats.not better than batman, but surely worth having a look

    People are going to think I'm crazy, but I actually like this film is better than the previous, even better than most of Christopher Nolan's franchise. This is probably where the Batman series got to its darkest. I'm not just saying that due to the Gothic setting and down-beat atmosphere, but also because of the tension that builds between each of the main characters. The Bat, the Cat, and the Penguin are trying to identify themselves among everyone else in their lives. The film portrays this intensity by showing they are more connected than they realize. To me, the film, in its own right, is a masterpiece. There is fantastic acting, beautiful imagery, interesting plots and even an incredible soundtrack by Danny Elfman. This was, unfortunately, the last Batman film with Tim Burton as director. Fans then had to see the horrors of... well... just read my review for Batman Forever.

    Ah, heres a movie I remember fondly from my childhood. Man I had it all, the toys, the McDonald's happy meal toys (not to mention those cool large plastic McDonald's cups my mom bought me) the sega video game, the trading cards, the t shirts, the batmobile candy dispensers, all kinds of neat merch based on the movie. of course in retrospect, this is not at all a kids movie, despite the fact its batman and was aimed at kids who bought happy meals. but that doesn't mean its not a great movie. not every superhero movie has to cater strictly to the kids. nevertheless, my 6 year old self was too in love with batman to care about how dark it was, I still loved anything and everything having to do with my favorite superhero and I must have watched this movie, along with the other 2 movies (1989 batman and batman forever) a zillion times on video. here's the premise. Batman truly does Return in this sequel to the 1989 mega hit, and this time hes better then ever. hes got some new toys (like the electronic self-targeting Baterang), vehicles and even has 2 new classic villains to contend with. penguin is a classic Tim Burton character in this one, but that can only be a good thing. in this movie, Burton makes the characters very ambiguous. is the penguin really half animal, half human? is cat woman part cat, part woman? these questions never really get answered. personally, i don't believe they are part animal at all. the penguin is all human albeit a VERY deformed and ugly one, and is only called Penguin because of his deformities. Catwoman is always human but the whole "9 lives" thing makes it ambiguous whether she has supernatural powers or whether shes just very lucky. its debatable. Batman is the only normal guy in this. in fact, Keaton being the calm cool hero both as Bruce Wayne and batman, grounds the movie and keeps it together whereas the 2 villains are completely crazy and psychotic nut cases. it seemed Keaton didn't have it all together in the last movie, he had a a lot of demons to fight with, but by the end you got the feeling he found his purpose in life, now that hes got a bat-signal and the law on his side. so naturally, in this one he seems more together and knows what hes doing. its the villains who are not together and have all these obvious mental problems, so much so that they actually make batman look normal. if it was anyone else playing batman, it wouldn't have worked. but Michael Keaton has a unique screen presence that when he puts on the bat suit, he literally IS batman and lets face it, no one before or since has had the manly swagger that Michael Keaton had as batman. he was a bit older, getting some greys, was this sort of gruff everyman but has this seriousness and "normal guy" look that makes you take him seriously as batman. other actors who have played batman seem too pretty boy or hand picked and thus don't feel real. Keaton is like the everyman normal looking 40 year old gruff guy and he demands you take him seriously. this is a very artsy film, compared to its blockbuster brother from 1989, which was basically a cut-&-dry blockbuster action/adventure. but it really didn't have any emotion or depth to it, despite Keaton's sincere efforts. Thats where Returns comes in. all the characters are very interesting and in a way, they all echo Batman. Catwoman is the dark vigilante side of him, while the Penguin shows what Bruce Wayne could have been if he turned bitter against the world. I've heard many ppl say that this batman film is not really about Batman himself, and that too much attention is given to the villains, but i will say again, its not a bad thing, and doesn't ruin this film. batman himself is really not a very interesting character when you think about it. hes essentially a guy who's see's his parents get killed as a kid, he trains for X years, then decides to becomes batman for revenge purposes. OK. thats it. there's no more to it really. certainly not something i want to watch for a whole 2 hours. i really didn't see a point in making a whole movie about his origin a couple years ago, i think it was a waste. i was always kinda hoping they would bring back the Burton style of filmaking for batman movies, or maybe even get Burton back to direct. but alas, we got something that felt like a lesser version of the 1989 film. sad. but hey, we always have the Tim Burton films to enjoy. those, IMO, captured the real batman, beyond the facade of "comic book" movie looks (which, in Burton's case, is actually a good thing). as far as i'm concerned, Burton is the only guy to have directed Batman movies. hes the only one who i believed truly understood batman, as you can see in his various films. the other directors never really...got it. they just don't get batman. they only got him as a character, thats it. but Burton KNEW batman, he understood his plight in life, and the darkness inherent in the material. thats why this is to me, the best, and most personal, Batman film. it shows batman, and his villains, at there most raw. they are all hurt individuals, and thats what makes this film so powerful. this is what a batman film should be. serious, witty, playful, phycological, and DARK. while still retaining the comic book style that we all expect. this film also paved the way for the wonderful Batman: The Animated Series, which also shares Tim Burton's dark, Gothic look and feel from both of his Batman films. it even uses the same theme!

    My friends will know I have a mixed opinion of Nolans batman films. Begins was dull, TDK was pretty cool and TDKR....well, we have batman and robin to contend with worst batman movie. I say this as my friends say "the old films are to light hearted" I reply "Go watch batman returns" This film takes influences both from Batman and Burton's film he made just before this, Edward Scissorhands. The latter was Burton's personal favourite film, and for this film, he wanted to bring something new to the table. Batman returns has the Gothic, almost fairy tale like feel of Scissorhands-a dark, twisted fairy tale anyway. This is due to impressive production design, and Danny Elfmans score, which has the choir elements added in for that Burton feel. Keaton returns and once again impresses as batman. He isn't in that much (more than in TDKR though) but he brings a real pressence on screen. He is in my eyes the true Batman. Danny DeVito is the warped penguin and he is a very interesting, if vile, character. A great costume and make up team make him a great villain. Although he is not the crime boss from the comics, the abandoned mutant makes him a more sympathetic villain- only Aaron Eckhart is more sympathetic than penguin in the batman films. Michelle Pfeiffer is the scene stealer here as catwomen. Her demented take on the anti hero is very engaging and she has one of the coolest costumes ever. Finally Christopher Walken appears as corrupt tycoon Max Schrek. He is basically playing himself-which is awesome, as he is Christopher Walken. So we have a strong cast-what about the story? While it's morbid and dark, it's very interesting. Its complex and not realistic but is very powerful-but not uplifting. As for the production, Gotham looks as dark as it will ever look-its mostly set at night. Its a memroble setting, but not comic book-y-more Tim Burton-y. The music gets the tone of the film across very well-Danny Elfman has composed a real gem here. The action however is a bit lackluster-the music holds it together, making it seem more exciting. The biggest problem the film has is that its not a comic book movie-it does change the villains backstories, batman is slightly to immoral and the story doesn't have the simple plots or action to make it a comic book movie. Although its not the best representation of batman or comic book movies, and a disappointment compared to its predecessor, its a great watch if your into the dark worlds of Tim Burton-defiantly the dark knights darkest hour.

    I'll go ahead and say it, Batman Returns is my favorite Batman movie. As much as I love Nolan's Batman films such like 2008's Dark Knight for making more sense and realistic. I like how fun Batman Returns is. Yes, it's campy, creepy, and the plot makes little to no sense, still it's a lot of fun for me. Don't get me wrong, Nolan's films are superior movies over Tim Burton's mediocre films, but there is something about Batman Returns that get me watching all the time when it's on, TV. I think it's because it's feels like a creepy comic book movie. For me, this isn't supposed to be remotely realistic, this is a straight up fantasy. It has that old school horror movie feel to it. I love the Danny Elfman score, the cinematography, the set design, the ghoulish and semi-camp German Expressionism tone. I can see why it was too frightening for children to the point that parents got rid of the Batman Returns Happy Meals and didn't allow the kids to watch it. There were serious WTF moments in the film that pretty damn dark like Penguin (Danny Devito) eating a man's nose, a baby being abandon, sexually depraved dialogues between the Penguin and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and countless deaths. But seriously did any of these children ever see The Dark Knight? I have to say that, pretty scary and violence as well. Honestly, it's the parent's choice to allow their kids to watch it or not. Thank God, my parents allow me to see it because it's the film that made me a fan of Batman. This movie is messy, nonsensical and heavily flawed and I still love it. The movie starts out Penguin being abandoned by his parents because of his physical deformities when a child, he then tries to rejoin humanity with the help of a businessmen Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who then uses him as a part of his plot to allow his business to continue to operate free from government oversight by asking him to become mayor after the city start to sympathize him for what his parents did to him. What the film does wrong, is make him a villain outright without much character development. Rather than getting abused and tossed aside just at the moment when he almost begins to believe that perhaps he is capable of being respected and that people may not be so bad, the film makes him deranged, terrorist and the monstrous psychopath bear little resemblance to the savvy, anti-heroic thief or the neutral informant businessman of the comics. If only they had the betrayal by the city folks drives him insane and he tries to destroy the society that spurned and abused him would make an excellent movie rather than Penguin looking like a monster dimwit with his multiplies fails plots like getting revenge on Gotham socialites by abducting and killing their infant or blowing the city with penguin carrying missiles. As much as I like Christopher Walken and his President Andrew Jackson's hairdo, the story could have done without his character. I know Shreck is the bad-guy of the film that needed to put Selena on her quest for revenge and track towards insanity. You can easier fit Penguin in that role. The best part of the film is the conflict & romance of Selena and Bruce that should had been the main focal point of the film. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) and Selina Kyle. Pfeiffer and Keaton both give great performances, and their on-screen chemistry is excellent. If the main focus had been on developing their relationship it would have been a great movie. As it is, just a handful of short scenes together simply didn't cut it. The sequence with Bruce and Selena at the party was the best scene in the film. The conflict and chemistry between the two draws you in, especially when watching Selena's own problems with mounting insanity. Still, don't know how she became a master of kung-fu. I love Michelle's catwoman more than Anna Hatchaway in 2012's Dark Knight's Rises. As much as I love Michelle, Anne Hathaway comes the closest to portraying Catwoman from the comics as far as the movies goes. Still, Michael Keaton was the best Batman. The mischaracterizations of Batman from the first film are carried over and amplified here. Batman is murderous, and remorseless. True, Batman originally carried a gun and killed, but that aspect of the character didn't survive the first year of an 80+ year run, and is not really a valid interpretation of the character anymore. Batman doesn't murder people. Thank God, Marlon Wayans wasn't portraying Robin and Robin was cut out. The inconsistent tone of the film also works against it. Burton presents a very bleak, grim, nihilistic serious story, where the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are monsters. He them loads the film with absurdist camp set pieces, but plays them straight and seems to expect the audience to take them seriously. This causes the tone to shift wildly, and the audience ends up laughing at things meant to be taken seriously and taking jokes at face value. Artistic license is one thing, but these characters got the worst of the Burton treatment, and both characters suffer for it in a major way. Overall: I agree Batman Returns had flaws. Batman Return has a somber tone punctuated with ridiculousness, but it's watchable. I can't say the same with its follow ups: 1995's Batman Forever and 1997's Batman & Robin. Those movies nearly ruin batman until Nolan step in with 2005's Batman Begins. Still, glad Tim Burton didn't made another Batman after this.

    Batman Returns was a major disappointment to me. When I saw the first Batman in this series, I loved it (mostly due to Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker). The thing about these original Batman movies is that they put the majority of the focus on the villains. The Joker was a complete show maker in the last one, but this one includes Danny DeVito as the Penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman. While both actors did a good job, the two different stories of the Penguin and Cat Woman did not make a good combination. The Penguins story was depressing which added gloom to the story, and Cat Woman's story was disturbing which added darkness to the story. Put them together and you have a movie that's disturbingly depressing (or Depressingly Disturbing which ever you prefer.) Batman himself was played for the last time by Michael Keaton. A lot of people were mad when Keaton didn't return in the last two films for this series but personally I was OK with it. It's not that I think that he's a bad actor, as much as I think that he wasn't a convincing Batman (he doesn't look the part for starters). The rest of the acting was good. Particularly Christopher Walken as Max. He did a great job. I just don't think that a movie that doubles up on negative emotions is a good way to get buyers. And so thus, after one successful movie, the Batman franchise began to fail.

    Hello readers, I am back with another review, this time about one of the most controversial super-hero movies of all time, BATMAN RETURNS. The film opens with a young penguin being thrown into the sewer by his hateful parents. This calls for Danny Elfman's new musical score to come in. Already I can see how dark this film is going to be than the previous. The reason of this is that Tim Burton had the freedom to make a Batman film the way he liked it which makes for a bizarre and Gothic entry... due to the great success of the first installment that is. So the film then proceeds with an awesome action scene where Batman returns. Then we get a scene with Max Shrek confronting the Penguin played by Danny DeVito who is so freaky and compelling in this film. I always wondered, who the hell taught The Penguin how to talk? The scene is quite scary and now we are finally assured that we are in for one hell of "BURTON" type film. Why didn't he just make another film with this kind of style, why do it to poor Batman? Anyway Max Shrek throws Selina Kyle out of a window and when she lays on the ground a pack of cats start well ravaging her until she comes too in a frightening scene. We then get a scene of Selina loosing her mind thus becoming the film's second villain, Catwoman. The rest of the film drags with fake action scenes and bizarre confrontations. They film becomes very un-enjoyable during the half way point and just becomes ultimately weird. I mean look at all these scenes, there's the bit when Penguin bites this guys nose, Penguin eats a raw fish, Catwoman and Batman get all frisky and it just seems to be more of a BEETLE JUICE film than a Batman film. I mean seriously Tim, why not just make your own bloody movie! Why just completely weird-out the Batman series and thus create Batman Forever! Along with the just as bad Batman And Robin. After a mind bendingly stupid plan by The Penguin we reach the final battle which features a pretty cool scene with Michael Keaton turning around to see the helpless Penguin as sparks pop behind him. So the film finishes with a mystery which leaves me hoping for another Burton film which was never made due to parents, believe it or not! That's your fault for making it all dark and weird Tim! And, yeah the film is OK and with no doubt isn't as bad as most claim but here ends my review for Batman Returns, the wonderfully different entry to the Batman legacy. See you soon for further reviews or you can check out my previous ones...

    This is one of those movies that's going to affect your opinion of it in weird ways, the more you think of it.

    Usually doing a second film no matter what the genre is. Is a good thing. It takes it to another level. My experience with Batman Returns was still pretty good. But not as enjoyable than the first film that was made in (1989). Michael Keaton returns to the franchise. I definitely think he's the best Batman of all time. George Clooney sucked. And whoever else played him was awful. This was a terrific choice for an actor. All of the special effects can get a little goofy at times. It has some intense scenes though. In my opinion this film is for kids age: 12 and up. So I give this movie a thumbs up. The first film gets two thumbs up. It was amazing. This one wasn't amazing. But it did continue the story in a nice way. The style of the camera shots were good. The close ups were nice. And overall the film did have its moments. So it's not awful. If you're a true Batman fan see it.

    First of all, and I think you would agree, that the second movie off any film is not as good as the first one. With Batman returns this was the case. Not great, but still good. Keaton still makes a good batman. The bat suite was tampered with a little bit but it mostly looks the same. But yet again the story of how the villain became a villain was told. Not how batman was created. This time two villains had risen, the penguin and cat-woman. The penguin was a bit overdone for my liking, his huge nose, three fingers on each hand, funny shaped body and hi even living with penguins! Gosh I wonder what they were trying to say? Is he maybe half penguin? Still Danny deVito played it well. Catwoman is a bit far-fetched. She was really made from the likes of cats.not better than batman, but surely worth having a look

    People are going to think I'm crazy, but I actually like this film is better than the previous, even better than most of Christopher Nolan's franchise. This is probably where the Batman series got to its darkest. I'm not just saying that due to the Gothic setting and down-beat atmosphere, but also because of the tension that builds between each of the main characters. The Bat, the Cat, and the Penguin are trying to identify themselves among everyone else in their lives. The film portrays this intensity by showing they are more connected than they realize. To me, the film, in its own right, is a masterpiece. There is fantastic acting, beautiful imagery, interesting plots and even an incredible soundtrack by Danny Elfman. This was, unfortunately, the last Batman film with Tim Burton as director. Fans then had to see the horrors of... well... just read my review for Batman Forever.

    Ah, heres a movie I remember fondly from my childhood. Man I had it all, the toys, the McDonald's happy meal toys (not to mention those cool large plastic McDonald's cups my mom bought me) the sega video game, the trading cards, the t shirts, the batmobile candy dispensers, all kinds of neat merch based on the movie. of course in retrospect, this is not at all a kids movie, despite the fact its batman and was aimed at kids who bought happy meals. but that doesn't mean its not a great movie. not every superhero movie has to cater strictly to the kids. nevertheless, my 6 year old self was too in love with batman to care about how dark it was, I still loved anything and everything having to do with my favorite superhero and I must have watched this movie, along with the other 2 movies (1989 batman and batman forever) a zillion times on video. here's the premise. Batman truly does Return in this sequel to the 1989 mega hit, and this time hes better then ever. hes got some new toys (like the electronic self-targeting Baterang), vehicles and even has 2 new classic villains to contend with. penguin is a classic Tim Burton character in this one, but that can only be a good thing. in this movie, Burton makes the characters very ambiguous. is the penguin really half animal, half human? is cat woman part cat, part woman? these questions never really get answered. personally, i don't believe they are part animal at all. the penguin is all human albeit a VERY deformed and ugly one, and is only called Penguin because of his deformities. Catwoman is always human but the whole "9 lives" thing makes it ambiguous whether she has supernatural powers or whether shes just very lucky. its debatable. Batman is the only normal guy in this. in fact, Keaton being the calm cool hero both as Bruce Wayne and batman, grounds the movie and keeps it together whereas the 2 villains are completely crazy and psychotic nut cases. it seemed Keaton didn't have it all together in the last movie, he had a a lot of demons to fight with, but by the end you got the feeling he found his purpose in life, now that hes got a bat-signal and the law on his side. so naturally, in this one he seems more together and knows what hes doing. its the villains who are not together and have all these obvious mental problems, so much so that they actually make batman look normal. if it was anyone else playing batman, it wouldn't have worked. but Michael Keaton has a unique screen presence that when he puts on the bat suit, he literally IS batman and lets face it, no one before or since has had the manly swagger that Michael Keaton had as batman. he was a bit older, getting some greys, was this sort of gruff everyman but has this seriousness and "normal guy" look that makes you take him seriously as batman. other actors who have played batman seem too pretty boy or hand picked and thus don't feel real. Keaton is like the everyman normal looking 40 year old gruff guy and he demands you take him seriously. this is a very artsy film, compared to its blockbuster brother from 1989, which was basically a cut-&-dry blockbuster action/adventure. but it really didn't have any emotion or depth to it, despite Keaton's sincere efforts. Thats where Returns comes in. all the characters are very interesting and in a way, they all echo Batman. Catwoman is the dark vigilante side of him, while the Penguin shows what Bruce Wayne could have been if he turned bitter against the world. I've heard many ppl say that this batman film is not really about Batman himself, and that too much attention is given to the villains, but i will say again, its not a bad thing, and doesn't ruin this film. batman himself is really not a very interesting character when you think about it. hes essentially a guy who's see's his parents get killed as a kid, he trains for X years, then decides to becomes batman for revenge purposes. OK. thats it. there's no more to it really. certainly not something i want to watch for a whole 2 hours. i really didn't see a point in making a whole movie about his origin a couple years ago, i think it was a waste. i was always kinda hoping they would bring back the Burton style of filmaking for batman movies, or maybe even get Burton back to direct. but alas, we got something that felt like a lesser version of the 1989 film. sad. but hey, we always have the Tim Burton films to enjoy. those, IMO, captured the real batman, beyond the facade of "comic book" movie looks (which, in Burton's case, is actually a good thing). as far as i'm concerned, Burton is the only guy to have directed Batman movies. hes the only one who i believed truly understood batman, as you can see in his various films. the other directors never really...got it. they just don't get batman. they only got him as a character, thats it. but Burton KNEW batman, he understood his plight in life, and the darkness inherent in the material. thats why this is to me, the best, and most personal, Batman film. it shows batman, and his villains, at there most raw. they are all hurt individuals, and thats what makes this film so powerful. this is what a batman film should be. serious, witty, playful, phycological, and DARK. while still retaining the comic book style that we all expect. this film also paved the way for the wonderful Batman: The Animated Series, which also shares Tim Burton's dark, Gothic look and feel from both of his Batman films. it even uses the same theme!

    My friends will know I have a mixed opinion of Nolans batman films. Begins was dull, TDK was pretty cool and TDKR....well, we have batman and robin to contend with worst batman movie. I say this as my friends say "the old films are to light hearted" I reply "Go watch batman returns" This film takes influences both from Batman and Burton's film he made just before this, Edward Scissorhands. The latter was Burton's personal favourite film, and for this film, he wanted to bring something new to the table. Batman returns has the Gothic, almost fairy tale like feel of Scissorhands-a dark, twisted fairy tale anyway. This is due to impressive production design, and Danny Elfmans score, which has the choir elements added in for that Burton feel. Keaton returns and once again impresses as batman. He isn't in that much (more than in TDKR though) but he brings a real pressence on screen. He is in my eyes the true Batman. Danny DeVito is the warped penguin and he is a very interesting, if vile, character. A great costume and make up team make him a great villain. Although he is not the crime boss from the comics, the abandoned mutant makes him a more sympathetic villain- only Aaron Eckhart is more sympathetic than penguin in the batman films. Michelle Pfeiffer is the scene stealer here as catwomen. Her demented take on the anti hero is very engaging and she has one of the coolest costumes ever. Finally Christopher Walken appears as corrupt tycoon Max Schrek. He is basically playing himself-which is awesome, as he is Christopher Walken. So we have a strong cast-what about the story? While it's morbid and dark, it's very interesting. Its complex and not realistic but is very powerful-but not uplifting. As for the production, Gotham looks as dark as it will ever look-its mostly set at night. Its a memroble setting, but not comic book-y-more Tim Burton-y. The music gets the tone of the film across very well-Danny Elfman has composed a real gem here. The action however is a bit lackluster-the music holds it together, making it seem more exciting. The biggest problem the film has is that its not a comic book movie-it does change the villains backstories, batman is slightly to immoral and the story doesn't have the simple plots or action to make it a comic book movie. Although its not the best representation of batman or comic book movies, and a disappointment compared to its predecessor, its a great watch if your into the dark worlds of Tim Burton-defiantly the dark knights darkest hour.

    I'll go ahead and say it, Batman Returns is my favorite Batman movie. As much as I love Nolan's Batman films such like 2008's Dark Knight for making more sense and realistic. I like how fun Batman Returns is. Yes, it's campy, creepy, and the plot makes little to no sense, still it's a lot of fun for me. Don't get me wrong, Nolan's films are superior movies over Tim Burton's mediocre films, but there is something about Batman Returns that get me watching all the time when it's on, TV. I think it's because it's feels like a creepy comic book movie. For me, this isn't supposed to be remotely realistic, this is a straight up fantasy. It has that old school horror movie feel to it. I love the Danny Elfman score, the cinematography, the set design, the ghoulish and semi-camp German Expressionism tone. I can see why it was too frightening for children to the point that parents got rid of the Batman Returns Happy Meals and didn't allow the kids to watch it. There were serious WTF moments in the film that pretty damn dark like Penguin (Danny Devito) eating a man's nose, a baby being abandon, sexually depraved dialogues between the Penguin and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and countless deaths. But seriously did any of these children ever see The Dark Knight? I have to say that, pretty scary and violence as well. Honestly, it's the parent's choice to allow their kids to watch it or not. Thank God, my parents allow me to see it because it's the film that made me a fan of Batman. This movie is messy, nonsensical and heavily flawed and I still love it. The movie starts out Penguin being abandoned by his parents because of his physical deformities when a child, he then tries to rejoin humanity with the help of a businessmen Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who then uses him as a part of his plot to allow his business to continue to operate free from government oversight by asking him to become mayor after the city start to sympathize him for what his parents did to him. What the film does wrong, is make him a villain outright without much character development. Rather than getting abused and tossed aside just at the moment when he almost begins to believe that perhaps he is capable of being respected and that people may not be so bad, the film makes him deranged, terrorist and the monstrous psychopath bear little resemblance to the savvy, anti-heroic thief or the neutral informant businessman of the comics. If only they had the betrayal by the city folks drives him insane and he tries to destroy the society that spurned and abused him would make an excellent movie rather than Penguin looking like a monster dimwit with his multiplies fails plots like getting revenge on Gotham socialites by abducting and killing their infant or blowing the city with penguin carrying missiles. As much as I like Christopher Walken and his President Andrew Jackson's hairdo, the story could have done without his character. I know Shreck is the bad-guy of the film that needed to put Selena on her quest for revenge and track towards insanity. You can easier fit Penguin in that role. The best part of the film is the conflict & romance of Selena and Bruce that should had been the main focal point of the film. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) and Selina Kyle. Pfeiffer and Keaton both give great performances, and their on-screen chemistry is excellent. If the main focus had been on developing their relationship it would have been a great movie. As it is, just a handful of short scenes together simply didn't cut it. The sequence with Bruce and Selena at the party was the best scene in the film. The conflict and chemistry between the two draws you in, especially when watching Selena's own problems with mounting insanity. Still, don't know how she became a master of kung-fu. I love Michelle's catwoman more than Anna Hatchaway in 2012's Dark Knight's Rises. As much as I love Michelle, Anne Hathaway comes the closest to portraying Catwoman from the comics as far as the movies goes. Still, Michael Keaton was the best Batman. The mischaracterizations of Batman from the first film are carried over and amplified here. Batman is murderous, and remorseless. True, Batman originally carried a gun and killed, but that aspect of the character didn't survive the first year of an 80+ year run, and is not really a valid interpretation of the character anymore. Batman doesn't murder people. Thank God, Marlon Wayans wasn't portraying Robin and Robin was cut out. The inconsistent tone of the film also works against it. Burton presents a very bleak, grim, nihilistic serious story, where the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are monsters. He them loads the film with absurdist camp set pieces, but plays them straight and seems to expect the audience to take them seriously. This causes the tone to shift wildly, and the audience ends up laughing at things meant to be taken seriously and taking jokes at face value. Artistic license is one thing, but these characters got the worst of the Burton treatment, and both characters suffer for it in a major way. Overall: I agree Batman Returns had flaws. Batman Return has a somber tone punctuated with ridiculousness, but it's watchable. I can't say the same with its follow ups: 1995's Batman Forever and 1997's Batman & Robin. Those movies nearly ruin batman until Nolan step in with 2005's Batman Begins. Still, glad Tim Burton didn't made another Batman after this.

    Batman Returns was a major disappointment to me. When I saw the first Batman in this series, I loved it (mostly due to Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker). The thing about these original Batman movies is that they put the majority of the focus on the villains. The Joker was a complete show maker in the last one, but this one includes Danny DeVito as the Penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman. While both actors did a good job, the two different stories of the Penguin and Cat Woman did not make a good combination. The Penguins story was depressing which added gloom to the story, and Cat Woman's story was disturbing which added darkness to the story. Put them together and you have a movie that's disturbingly depressing (or Depressingly Disturbing which ever you prefer.) Batman himself was played for the last time by Michael Keaton. A lot of people were mad when Keaton didn't return in the last two films for this series but personally I was OK with it. It's not that I think that he's a bad actor, as much as I think that he wasn't a convincing Batman (he doesn't look the part for starters). The rest of the acting was good. Particularly Christopher Walken as Max. He did a great job. I just don't think that a movie that doubles up on negative emotions is a good way to get buyers. And so thus, after one successful movie, the Batman franchise began to fail.

    Hello readers, I am back with another review, this time about one of the most controversial super-hero movies of all time, BATMAN RETURNS. The film opens with a young penguin being thrown into the sewer by his hateful parents. This calls for Danny Elfman's new musical score to come in. Already I can see how dark this film is going to be than the previous. The reason of this is that Tim Burton had the freedom to make a Batman film the way he liked it which makes for a bizarre and Gothic entry... due to the great success of the first installment that is. So the film then proceeds with an awesome action scene where Batman returns. Then we get a scene with Max Shrek confronting the Penguin played by Danny DeVito who is so freaky and compelling in this film. I always wondered, who the hell taught The Penguin how to talk? The scene is quite scary and now we are finally assured that we are in for one hell of "BURTON" type film. Why didn't he just make another film with this kind of style, why do it to poor Batman? Anyway Max Shrek throws Selina Kyle out of a window and when she lays on the ground a pack of cats start well ravaging her until she comes too in a frightening scene. We then get a scene of Selina loosing her mind thus becoming the film's second villain, Catwoman. The rest of the film drags with fake action scenes and bizarre confrontations. They film becomes very un-enjoyable during the half way point and just becomes ultimately weird. I mean look at all these scenes, there's the bit when Penguin bites this guys nose, Penguin eats a raw fish, Catwoman and Batman get all frisky and it just seems to be more of a BEETLE JUICE film than a Batman film. I mean seriously Tim, why not just make your own bloody movie! Why just completely weird-out the Batman series and thus create Batman Forever! Along with the just as bad Batman And Robin. After a mind bendingly stupid plan by The Penguin we reach the final battle which features a pretty cool scene with Michael Keaton turning around to see the helpless Penguin as sparks pop behind him. So the film finishes with a mystery which leaves me hoping for another Burton film which was never made due to parents, believe it or not! That's your fault for making it all dark and weird Tim! And, yeah the film is OK and with no doubt isn't as bad as most claim but here ends my review for Batman Returns, the wonderfully different entry to the Batman legacy. See you soon for further reviews or you can check out my previous ones...

    Equally magnificent sequel has Michael Keaton returning as Bruce Wayne/Batman, only here is opposed by the double threat of Catwoman(marvelously played by the sultry Michele Pfeiffer) who starts off as harried secretary Selina Kyle, who is transformed into Catwoman after a betrayal. They develop a close relationship, since they both have a great deal in common... Danny DeVito portrays Oswald Cobblepot/the Penquin, who was a deformed child brought up in the sewers of Gotham, and now heads a criminal gang. DeVito effectively plays the pathos of this man, who can't decide if he wants to re-enter society or not, but a dramatic turn-of-events pushes him over the edge... Filled with fantastic action, set design, and music score, this production is another triumph, one of the few sequels to match the original, even though some feel it is too dark, the subject matter suits this. A great pity that star Michael Keaton and director Tim Burton stopped here, and didn't get the chance to do a trilogy, since the new team drove this series off the rails...A shame that.

    This is one of those movies that's going to affect your opinion of it in weird ways, the more you think of it. For some this is a movie that got better with time, and for many others it only had gotten worse. Unfortunately the latter has happened for me, and to be honest there was a time when I gave it at least a 7, because I thought as a Tim Burton movie, and not a Batman movie, it succeeded, but then I re-visited it to only find that it's more a carbon copy of one of his past works. That movie is possibly his most critically acclaimed movie Edward Scissorhands, which is actually good on its own merits, but it's not necessarily a movie that can be redone to great success. Why I say this about Returns is that right from the get go we as viewers don't feel like we're in Gotham anymore, but really just this small claustrophobic set, that doesn't feel quite as large as the Gotham seen in the first movie, but more let the sets to Scissorhands which also had an ironic Christmas setting. Notably the most obvious parallel, other than the whole Christmas setting, is that Edward and Oswald 'The Penguin' have the same makeup job. Another thing the two have in common that Burton has been doing for awhile now is that he always feels the need to have outcasts in his stories, that he wants you to feel sad for, which for a sympathetic character like Edward you would, but with characters such as The Penguin who are just naturally sick, twisted, and villainous, you really don't. The story for this doesn't have one narrative form to stick to, therefore the story itself really doesn't seem to know which character is really the protagonist. It should be Batman, but even much more so than in the original one he's so hidden from the audience that it's hard to care for many of the things that happen to him. What fascinates me, is when they present an interesting idea for him to get involved in, it chooses to not have enough focus on that. What I mostly refer to is his relationship with Selina/Catwoman, having a character that has similar qualities to the hero can make for a very interesting love relationship, but as you see in the movie they really only give the Bruce/Selina aspect 2-3 small scenes to do it justice, and her Catwoman facet is hard to read, as she seemingly tries seducing Batman to get the better of him not to find a relationship in him, leaving another plot thread that could've had further development through that side of it, but in the end resorts to it just feeling very unfinished. Now Michelle Pfeiffer's performance overall is okay, it's just that I really couldn't take her seriously as a character, which is ironic considering that she's probably the only character with an emotional arc in it. I think the reason why is that despite Burton trying to go for a somewhat darker tone, he still put in lots of silly, campy, cartoon humor that somewhat makes some of the performances like Michelle's feels unbalanced, because they ask us to care about an emotional arc that she has that kind of gets suffocated in the paraphernalia of the character, and the same goes for Danny as the Penguin. Tim Burton has recently stated that he now feels that his Batman movies look like lighthearted romps these days, and I can definitely see why he said that. I'm not implying that there shouldn't be any humor in it, but don't put so much in it that it feels forced. For me, and I think many others, the best thing to come out of this movie was the Danny Elfman score, a composer that's consistently coming up with great musical ideas for whatever movie he works on. Another positive thing about the movie that I can say is that even though the character of Max Schreck is written uninteresting, Christopher Walken makes it interesting by just being there, playing himself almost. I would compliment the visuals as being inspired, but now that I've revisited the movie, I can say that it's stuff borrowed from Burton's movie before this Edward Scissorhands, and I'd also add that visuals don't have much of a meaning without a meaningful story. ****

    Ah, heres a movie I remember fondly from my childhood. Man I had it all, the toys, the McDonald's happy meal toys (not to mention those cool large plastic McDonald's cups my mom bought me) the sega video game, the trading cards, the t shirts, the batmobile candy dispensers, all kinds of neat merch based on the movie. of course in retrospect, this is not at all a kids movie, despite the fact its batman and was aimed at kids who bought happy meals. but that doesn't mean its not a great movie. not every superhero movie has to cater strictly to the kids. nevertheless, my 6 year old self was too in love with batman to care about how dark it was, I still loved anything and everything having to do with my favorite superhero and I must have watched this movie, along with the other 2 movies (1989 batman and batman forever) a zillion times on video. here's the premise. Batman truly does Return in this sequel to the 1989 mega hit, and this time hes better then ever. hes got some new toys (like the electronic self-targeting Baterang), vehicles and even has 2 new classic villains to contend with. penguin is a classic Tim Burton character in this one, but that can only be a good thing. in this movie, Burton makes the characters very ambiguous. is the penguin really half animal, half human? is cat woman part cat, part woman? these questions never really get answered. personally, i don't believe they are part animal at all. the penguin is all human albeit a VERY deformed and ugly one, and is only called Penguin because of his deformities. Catwoman is always human but the whole "9 lives" thing makes it ambiguous whether she has supernatural powers or whether shes just very lucky. its debatable. Batman is the only normal guy in this. in fact, Keaton being the calm cool hero both as Bruce Wayne and batman, grounds the movie and keeps it together whereas the 2 villains are completely crazy and psychotic nut cases. it seemed Keaton didn't have it all together in the last movie, he had a a lot of demons to fight with, but by the end you got the feeling he found his purpose in life, now that hes got a bat-signal and the law on his side. so naturally, in this one he seems more together and knows what hes doing. its the villains who are not together and have all these obvious mental problems, so much so that they actually make batman look normal. if it was anyone else playing batman, it wouldn't have worked. but Michael Keaton has a unique screen presence that when he puts on the bat suit, he literally IS batman and lets face it, no one before or since has had the manly swagger that Michael Keaton had as batman. he was a bit older, getting some greys, was this sort of gruff everyman but has this seriousness and "normal guy" look that makes you take him seriously as batman. other actors who have played batman seem too pretty boy or hand picked and thus don't feel real. Keaton is like the everyman normal looking 40 year old gruff guy and he demands you take him seriously. this is a very artsy film, compared to its blockbuster brother from 1989, which was basically a cut-&-dry blockbuster action/adventure. but it really didn't have any emotion or depth to it, despite Keaton's sincere efforts. Thats where Returns comes in. all the characters are very interesting and in a way, they all echo Batman. Catwoman is the dark vigilante side of him, while the Penguin shows what Bruce Wayne could have been if he turned bitter against the world. I've heard many ppl say that this batman film is not really about Batman himself, and that too much attention is given to the villains, but i will say again, its not a bad thing, and doesn't ruin this film. batman himself is really not a very interesting character when you think about it. hes essentially a guy who's see's his parents get killed as a kid, he trains for X years, then decides to becomes batman for revenge purposes. OK. thats it. there's no more to it really. certainly not something i want to watch for a whole 2 hours. i really didn't see a point in making a whole movie about his origin a couple years ago, i think it was a waste. i was always kinda hoping they would bring back the Burton style of filmaking for batman movies, or maybe even get Burton back to direct. but alas, we got something that felt like a lesser version of the 1989 film. sad. but hey, we always have the Tim Burton films to enjoy. those, IMO, captured the real batman, beyond the facade of "comic book" movie looks (which, in Burton's case, is actually a good thing). as far as i'm concerned, Burton is the only guy to have directed Batman movies. hes the only one who i believed truly understood batman, as you can see in his various films. the other directors never really...got it. they just don't get batman. they only got him as a character, thats it. but Burton KNEW batman, he understood his plight in life, and the darkness inherent in the material. thats why this is to me, the best, and most personal, Batman film. it shows batman, and his villains, at there most raw. they are all hurt individuals, and thats what makes this film so powerful. this is what a batman film should be. serious, witty, playful, phycological, and DARK. while still retaining the comic book style that we all expect. this film also paved the way for the wonderful Batman: The Animated Series, which also shares Tim Burton's dark, Gothic look and feel from both of his Batman films. it even uses the same theme!

    My friends will know I have a mixed opinion of Nolans batman films. Begins was dull, TDK was pretty cool and TDKR....well, we have batman and robin to contend with worst batman movie. I say this as my friends say "the old films are to light hearted" I reply "Go watch batman returns" This film takes influences both from Batman and Burton's film he made just before this, Edward Scissorhands. The latter was Burton's personal favourite film, and for this film, he wanted to bring something new to the table. Batman returns has the Gothic, almost fairy tale like feel of Scissorhands-a dark, twisted fairy tale anyway. This is due to impressive production design, and Danny Elfmans score, which has the choir elements added in for that Burton feel. Keaton returns and once again impresses as batman. He isn't in that much (more than in TDKR though) but he brings a real pressence on screen. He is in my eyes the true Batman. Danny DeVito is the warped penguin and he is a very interesting, if vile, character. A great costume and make up team make him a great villain. Although he is not the crime boss from the comics, the abandoned mutant makes him a more sympathetic villain- only Aaron Eckhart is more sympathetic than penguin in the batman films. Michelle Pfeiffer is the scene stealer here as catwomen. Her demented take on the anti hero is very engaging and she has one of the coolest costumes ever. Finally Christopher Walken appears as corrupt tycoon Max Schrek. He is basically playing himself-which is awesome, as he is Christopher Walken. So we have a strong cast-what about the story? While it's morbid and dark, it's very interesting. Its complex and not realistic but is very powerful-but not uplifting. As for the production, Gotham looks as dark as it will ever look-its mostly set at night. Its a memroble setting, but not comic book-y-more Tim Burton-y. The music gets the tone of the film across very well-Danny Elfman has composed a real gem here. The action however is a bit lackluster-the music holds it together, making it seem more exciting. The biggest problem the film has is that its not a comic book movie-it does change the villains backstories, batman is slightly to immoral and the story doesn't have the simple plots or action to make it a comic book movie. Although its not the best representation of batman or comic book movies, and a disappointment compared to its predecessor, its a great watch if your into the dark worlds of Tim Burton-defiantly the dark knights darkest hour.

    I'll go ahead and say it, Batman Returns is my favorite Batman movie. As much as I love Nolan's Batman films such like 2008's Dark Knight for making more sense and realistic. I like how fun Batman Returns is. Yes, it's campy, creepy, and the plot makes little to no sense, still it's a lot of fun for me. Don't get me wrong, Nolan's films are superior movies over Tim Burton's mediocre films, but there is something about Batman Returns that get me watching all the time when it's on, TV. I think it's because it's feels like a creepy comic book movie. For me, this isn't supposed to be remotely realistic, this is a straight up fantasy. It has that old school horror movie feel to it. I love the Danny Elfman score, the cinematography, the set design, the ghoulish and semi-camp German Expressionism tone. I can see why it was too frightening for children to the point that parents got rid of the Batman Returns Happy Meals and didn't allow the kids to watch it. There were serious WTF moments in the film that pretty damn dark like Penguin (Danny Devito) eating a man's nose, a baby being abandon, sexually depraved dialogues between the Penguin and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and countless deaths. But seriously did any of these children ever see The Dark Knight? I have to say that, pretty scary and violence as well. Honestly, it's the parent's choice to allow their kids to watch it or not. Thank God, my parents allow me to see it because it's the film that made me a fan of Batman. This movie is messy, nonsensical and heavily flawed and I still love it. The movie starts out Penguin being abandoned by his parents because of his physical deformities when a child, he then tries to rejoin humanity with the help of a businessmen Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who then uses him as a part of his plot to allow his business to continue to operate free from government oversight by asking him to become mayor after the city start to sympathize him for what his parents did to him. What the film does wrong, is make him a villain outright without much character development. Rather than getting abused and tossed aside just at the moment when he almost begins to believe that perhaps he is capable of being respected and that people may not be so bad, the film makes him deranged, terrorist and the monstrous psychopath bear little resemblance to the savvy, anti-heroic thief or the neutral informant businessman of the comics. If only they had the betrayal by the city folks drives him insane and he tries to destroy the society that spurned and abused him would make an excellent movie rather than Penguin looking like a monster dimwit with his multiplies fails plots like getting revenge on Gotham socialites by abducting and killing their infant or blowing the city with penguin carrying missiles. As much as I like Christopher Walken and his President Andrew Jackson's hairdo, the story could have done without his character. I know Shreck is the bad-guy of the film that needed to put Selena on her quest for revenge and track towards insanity. You can easier fit Penguin in that role. The best part of the film is the conflict & romance of Selena and Bruce that should had been the main focal point of the film. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) and Selina Kyle. Pfeiffer and Keaton both give great performances, and their on-screen chemistry is excellent. If the main focus had been on developing their relationship it would have been a great movie. As it is, just a handful of short scenes together simply didn't cut it. The sequence with Bruce and Selena at the party was the best scene in the film. The conflict and chemistry between the two draws you in, especially when watching Selena's own problems with mounting insanity. Still, don't know how she became a master of kung-fu. I love Michelle's catwoman more than Anna Hatchaway in 2012's Dark Knight's Rises. As much as I love Michelle, Anne Hathaway comes the closest to portraying Catwoman from the comics as far as the movies goes. Still, Michael Keaton was the best Batman. The mischaracterizations of Batman from the first film are carried over and amplified here. Batman is murderous, and remorseless. True, Batman originally carried a gun and killed, but that aspect of the character didn't survive the first year of an 80+ year run, and is not really a valid interpretation of the character anymore. Batman doesn't murder people. Thank God, Marlon Wayans wasn't portraying Robin and Robin was cut out. The inconsistent tone of the film also works against it. Burton presents a very bleak, grim, nihilistic serious story, where the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are monsters. He them loads the film with absurdist camp set pieces, but plays them straight and seems to expect the audience to take them seriously. This causes the tone to shift wildly, and the audience ends up laughing at things meant to be taken seriously and taking jokes at face value. Artistic license is one thing, but these characters got the worst of the Burton treatment, and both characters suffer for it in a major way. Overall: I agree Batman Returns had flaws. Batman Return has a somber tone punctuated with ridiculousness, but it's watchable. I can't say the same with its follow ups: 1995's Batman Forever and 1997's Batman & Robin. Those movies nearly ruin batman until Nolan step in with 2005's Batman Begins. Still, glad Tim Burton didn't made another Batman after this.

    Batman Returns was a major disappointment to me. When I saw the first Batman in this series, I loved it (mostly due to Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker). The thing about these original Batman movies is that they put the majority of the focus on the villains. The Joker was a complete show maker in the last one, but this one includes Danny DeVito as the Penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman. While both actors did a good job, the two different stories of the Penguin and Cat Woman did not make a good combination. The Penguins story was depressing which added gloom to the story, and Cat Woman's story was disturbing which added darkness to the story. Put them together and you have a movie that's disturbingly depressing (or Depressingly Disturbing which ever you prefer.) Batman himself was played for the last time by Michael Keaton. A lot of people were mad when Keaton didn't return in the last two films for this series but personally I was OK with it. It's not that I think that he's a bad actor, as much as I think that he wasn't a convincing Batman (he doesn't look the part for starters). The rest of the acting was good. Particularly Christopher Walken as Max. He did a great job. I just don't think that a movie that doubles up on negative emotions is a good way to get buyers. And so thus, after one successful movie, the Batman franchise began to fail.

    Hello readers, I am back with another review, this time about one of the most controversial super-hero movies of all time, BATMAN RETURNS. The film opens with a young penguin being thrown into the sewer by his hateful parents. This calls for Danny Elfman's new musical score to come in. Already I can see how dark this film is going to be than the previous. The reason of this is that Tim Burton had the freedom to make a Batman film the way he liked it which makes for a bizarre and Gothic entry... due to the great success of the first installment that is. So the film then proceeds with an awesome action scene where Batman returns. Then we get a scene with Max Shrek confronting the Penguin played by Danny DeVito who is so freaky and compelling in this film. I always wondered, who the hell taught The Penguin how to talk? The scene is quite scary and now we are finally assured that we are in for one hell of "BURTON" type film. Why didn't he just make another film with this kind of style, why do it to poor Batman? Anyway Max Shrek throws Selina Kyle out of a window and when she lays on the ground a pack of cats start well ravaging her until she comes too in a frightening scene. We then get a scene of Selina loosing her mind thus becoming the film's second villain, Catwoman. The rest of the film drags with fake action scenes and bizarre confrontations. They film becomes very un-enjoyable during the half way point and just becomes ultimately weird. I mean look at all these scenes, there's the bit when Penguin bites this guys nose, Penguin eats a raw fish, Catwoman and Batman get all frisky and it just seems to be more of a BEETLE JUICE film than a Batman film. I mean seriously Tim, why not just make your own bloody movie! Why just completely weird-out the Batman series and thus create Batman Forever! Along with the just as bad Batman And Robin. After a mind bendingly stupid plan by The Penguin we reach the final battle which features a pretty cool scene with Michael Keaton turning around to see the helpless Penguin as sparks pop behind him. So the film finishes with a mystery which leaves me hoping for another Burton film which was never made due to parents, believe it or not! That's your fault for making it all dark and weird Tim! And, yeah the film is OK and with no doubt isn't as bad as most claim but here ends my review for Batman Returns, the wonderfully different entry to the Batman legacy. See you soon for further reviews or you can check out my previous ones...

    Equally magnificent sequel has Michael Keaton returning as Bruce Wayne/Batman, only here is opposed by the double threat of Catwoman(marvelously played by the sultry Michele Pfeiffer) who starts off as harried secretary Selina Kyle, who is transformed into Catwoman after a betrayal. They develop a close relationship, since they both have a great deal in common... Danny DeVito portrays Oswald Cobblepot/the Penquin, who was a deformed child brought up in the sewers of Gotham, and now heads a criminal gang. DeVito effectively plays the pathos of this man, who can't decide if he wants to re-enter society or not, but a dramatic turn-of-events pushes him over the edge... Filled with fantastic action, set design, and music score, this production is another triumph, one of the few sequels to match the original, even though some feel it is too dark, the subject matter suits this. A great pity that star Michael Keaton and director Tim Burton stopped here, and didn't get the chance to do a trilogy, since the new team drove this series off the rails...A shame that.

    This is one of those movies that's going to affect your opinion of it in weird ways, the more you think of it. For some this is a movie that got better with time, and for many others it only had gotten worse. Unfortunately the latter has happened for me, and to be honest there was a time when I gave it at least a 7, because I thought as a Tim Burton movie, and not a Batman movie, it succeeded, but then I re-visited it to only find that it's more a carbon copy of one of his past works. That movie is possibly his most critically acclaimed movie Edward Scissorhands, which is actually good on its own merits, but it's not necessarily a movie that can be redone to great success. Why I say this about Returns is that right from the get go we as viewers don't feel like we're in Gotham anymore, but really just this small claustrophobic set, that doesn't feel quite as large as the Gotham seen in the first movie, but more let the sets to Scissorhands which also had an ironic Christmas setting. Notably the most obvious parallel, other than the whole Christmas setting, is that Edward and Oswald 'The Penguin' have the same makeup job. Another thing the two have in common that Burton has been doing for awhile now is that he always feels the need to have outcasts in his stories, that he wants you to feel sad for, which for a sympathetic character like Edward you would, but with characters such as The Penguin who are just naturally sick, twisted, and villainous, you really don't. The story for this doesn't have one narrative form to stick to, therefore the story itself really doesn't seem to know which character is really the protagonist. It should be Batman, but even much more so than in the original one he's so hidden from the audience that it's hard to care for many of the things that happen to him. What fascinates me, is when they present an interesting idea for him to get involved in, it chooses to not have enough focus on that. What I mostly refer to is his relationship with Selina/Catwoman, having a character that has similar qualities to the hero can make for a very interesting love relationship, but as you see in the movie they really only give the Bruce/Selina aspect 2-3 small scenes to do it justice, and her Catwoman facet is hard to read, as she seemingly tries seducing Batman to get the better of him not to find a relationship in him, leaving another plot thread that could've had further development through that side of it, but in the end resorts to it just feeling very unfinished. Now Michelle Pfeiffer's performance overall is okay, it's just that I really couldn't take her seriously as a character, which is ironic considering that she's probably the only character with an emotional arc in it. I think the reason why is that despite Burton trying to go for a somewhat darker tone, he still put in lots of silly, campy, cartoon humor that somewhat makes some of the performances like Michelle's feels unbalanced, because they ask us to care about an emotional arc that she has that kind of gets suffocated in the paraphernalia of the character, and the same goes for Danny as the Penguin. Tim Burton has recently stated that he now feels that his Batman movies look like lighthearted romps these days, and I can definitely see why he said that. I'm not implying that there shouldn't be any humor in it, but don't put so much in it that it feels forced. For me, and I think many others, the best thing to come out of this movie was the Danny Elfman score, a composer that's consistently coming up with great musical ideas for whatever movie he works on. Another positive thing about the movie that I can say is that even though the character of Max Schreck is written uninteresting, Christopher Walken makes it interesting by just being there, playing himself almost. I would compliment the visuals as being inspired, but now that I've revisited the movie, I can say that it's stuff borrowed from Burton's movie before this Edward Scissorhands, and I'd also add that visuals don't have much of a meaning without a meaningful story. ****

    Usually doing a second film no matter what the genre is. Is a good thing. It takes it to another level. My experience with Batman Returns was still pretty good. But not as enjoyable than the first film that was made in (1989). Michael Keaton returns to the franchise. I definitely think he's the best Batman of all time. George Clooney sucked. And whoever else played him was awful. This was a terrific choice for an actor. All of the special effects can get a little goofy at times. It has some intense scenes though. In my opinion this film is for kids age: 12 and up. So I give this movie a thumbs up. The first film gets two thumbs up. It was amazing. This one wasn't amazing. But it did continue the story in a nice way. The style of the camera shots were good. The close ups were nice. And overall the film did have its moments. So it's not awful. If you're a true Batman fan see it.

    First of all, and I think you would agree, that the second movie off any film is not as good as the first one. With Batman returns this was the case. Not great, but still good. Keaton still makes a good batman. The bat suite was tampered with a little bit but it mostly looks the same. But yet again the story of how the villain became a villain was told. Not how batman was created. This time two villains had risen, the penguin and cat-woman. The penguin was a bit overdone for my liking, his huge nose, three fingers on each hand, funny shaped body and hi even living with penguins! Gosh I wonder what they were trying to say? Is he maybe half penguin? Still Danny deVito played it well. Catwoman is a bit far-fetched. She was really made from the likes of cats.not better than batman, but surely worth having a look

    People are going to think I'm crazy, but I actually like this film is better than the previous, even better than most of Christopher Nolan's franchise. This is probably where the Batman series got to its darkest. I'm not just saying that due to the Gothic setting and down-beat atmosphere, but also because of the tension that builds between each of the main characters. The Bat, the Cat, and the Penguin are trying to identify themselves among everyone else in their lives. The film portrays this intensity by showing they are more connected than they realize. To me, the film, in its own right, is a masterpiece. There is fantastic acting, beautiful imagery, interesting plots and even an incredible soundtrack by Danny Elfman. This was, unfortunately, the last Batman film with Tim Burton as director. Fans then had to see the horrors of... well... just read my review for Batman Forever.

    Ah, heres a movie I remember fondly from my childhood. Man I had it all, the toys, the McDonald's happy meal toys (not to mention those cool large plastic McDonald's cups my mom bought me) the sega video game, the trading cards, the t shirts, the batmobile candy dispensers, all kinds of neat merch based on the movie. of course in retrospect, this is not at all a kids movie, despite the fact its batman and was aimed at kids who bought happy meals. but that doesn't mean its not a great movie. not every superhero movie has to cater strictly to the kids. nevertheless, my 6 year old self was too in love with batman to care about how dark it was, I still loved anything and everything having to do with my favorite superhero and I must have watched this movie, along with the other 2 movies (1989 batman and batman forever) a zillion times on video. here's the premise. Batman truly does Return in this sequel to the 1989 mega hit, and this time hes better then ever. hes got some new toys (like the electronic self-targeting Baterang), vehicles and even has 2 new classic villains to contend with. penguin is a classic Tim Burton character in this one, but that can only be a good thing. in this movie, Burton makes the characters very ambiguous. is the penguin really half animal, half human? is cat woman part cat, part woman? these questions never really get answered. personally, i don't believe they are part animal at all. the penguin is all human albeit a VERY deformed and ugly one, and is only called Penguin because of his deformities. Catwoman is always human but the whole "9 lives" thing makes it ambiguous whether she has supernatural powers or whether shes just very lucky. its debatable.

    My friends will know I have a mixed opinion of Nolans batman films. Begins was dull, TDK was pretty cool and TDKR....well, we have batman and robin to contend with worst batman movie. I say this as my friends say "the old films are to light hearted" I reply "Go watch batman returns" This film takes influences both from Batman and Burton's film he made just before this, Edward Scissorhands. The latter was Burton's personal favourite film, and for this film, he wanted to bring something new to the table. Batman returns has the Gothic, almost fairy tale like feel of Scissorhands-a dark, twisted fairy tale anyway. This is due to impressive production design, and Danny Elfmans score, which has the choir elements added in for that Burton feel. Keaton returns and once again impresses as batman. He isn't in that much (more than in TDKR though) but he brings a real pressence on screen. He is in my eyes the true Batman. Danny DeVito is the warped penguin and he is a very interesting, if vile, character. A great costume and make up team make him a great villain. Although he is not the crime boss from the comics, the abandoned mutant makes him a more sympathetic villain- only Aaron Eckhart is more sympathetic than penguin in the batman films. Michelle Pfeiffer is the scene stealer here as catwomen. Her demented take on the anti hero is very engaging and she has one of the coolest costumes ever. Finally Christopher Walken appears as corrupt tycoon Max Schrek. He is basically playing himself-which is awesome, as he is Christopher Walken. So we have a strong cast-what about the story? While it's morbid and dark, it's very interesting. Its complex and not realistic but is very powerful-but not uplifting. As for the production, Gotham looks as dark as it will ever look-its mostly set at night. Its a memroble setting, but not comic book-y-more Tim Burton-y. The music gets the tone of the film across very well-Danny Elfman has composed a real gem here. The action however is a bit lackluster-the music holds it together, making it seem more exciting. The biggest problem the film has is that its not a comic book movie-it does change the villains backstories, batman is slightly to immoral and the story doesn't have the simple plots or action to make it a comic book movie. Although its not the best representation of batman or comic book movies, and a disappointment compared to its predecessor, its a great watch if your into the dark worlds of Tim Burton-defiantly the dark knights darkest hour.

    I'll go ahead and say it, Batman Returns is my favorite Batman movie. As much as I love Nolan's Batman films such like 2008's Dark Knight for making more sense and realistic. I like how fun Batman Returns is. Yes, it's campy, creepy, and the plot makes little to no sense, still it's a lot of fun for me. Don't get me wrong, Nolan's films are superior movies over Tim Burton's mediocre films, but there is something about Batman Returns that get me watching all the time when it's on, TV. I think it's because it's feels like a creepy comic book movie. For me, this isn't supposed to be remotely realistic, this is a straight up fantasy. It has that old school horror movie feel to it. I love the Danny Elfman score, the cinematography, the set design, the ghoulish and semi-camp German Expressionism tone. I can see why it was too frightening for children to the point that parents got rid of the Batman Returns Happy Meals and didn't allow the kids to watch it. There were serious WTF moments in the film that pretty damn dark like Penguin (Danny Devito) eating a man's nose, a baby being abandon, sexually depraved dialogues between the Penguin and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and countless deaths. But seriously did any of these children ever see The Dark Knight? I have to say that, pretty scary and violence as well. Honestly, it's the parent's choice to allow their kids to watch it or not. Thank God, my parents allow me to see it because it's the film that made me a fan of Batman. This movie is messy, nonsensical and heavily flawed and I still love it. The movie starts out Penguin being abandoned by his parents because of his physical deformities when a child, he then tries to rejoin humanity with the help of a businessmen Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who then uses him as a part of his plot to allow his business to continue to operate free from government oversight by asking him to become mayor after the city start to sympathize him for what his parents did to him. What the film does wrong, is make him a villain outright without much character development. Rather than getting abused and tossed aside just at the moment when he almost begins to believe that perhaps he is capable of being respected and that people may not be so bad, the film makes him deranged, terrorist and the monstrous psychopath bear little resemblance to the savvy, anti-heroic thief or the neutral informant businessman of the comics. If only they had the betrayal by the city folks drives him insane and he tries to destroy the society that spurned and abused him would make an excellent movie rather than Penguin looking like a monster dimwit with his multiplies fails plots like getting revenge on Gotham socialites by abducting and killing their infant or blowing the city with penguin carrying missiles. As much as I like Christopher Walken and his President Andrew Jackson's hairdo, the story could have done without his character. I know Shreck is the bad-guy of the film that needed to put Selena on her quest for revenge and track towards insanity. You can easier fit Penguin in that role. The best part of the film is the conflict & romance of Selena and Bruce that should had been the main focal point of the film. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) and Selina Kyle. Pfeiffer and Keaton both give great performances, and their on-screen chemistry is excellent. If the main focus had been on developing their relationship it would have been a great movie. As it is, just a handful of short scenes together simply didn't cut it. The sequence with Bruce and Selena at the party was the best scene in the film. The conflict and chemistry between the two draws you in, especially when watching Selena's own problems with mounting insanity. Still, don't know how she became a master of kung-fu. I love Michelle's catwoman more than Anna Hatchaway in 2012's Dark Knight's Rises. As much as I love Michelle, Anne Hathaway comes the closest to portraying Catwoman from the comics as far as the movies goes. Still, Michael Keaton was the best Batman. The mischaracterizations of Batman from the first film are carried over and amplified here. Batman is murderous, and remorseless. True, Batman originally carried a gun and killed, but that aspect of the character didn't survive the first year of an 80+ year run, and is not really a valid interpretation of the character anymore. Batman doesn't murder people. Thank God, Marlon Wayans wasn't portraying Robin and Robin was cut out. The inconsistent tone of the film also works against it. Burton presents a very bleak, grim, nihilistic serious story, where the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are monsters. He them loads the film with absurdist camp set pieces, but plays them straight and seems to expect the audience to take them seriously. This causes the tone to shift wildly, and the audience ends up laughing at things meant to be taken seriously and taking jokes at face value. Artistic license is one thing, but these characters got the worst of the Burton treatment, and both characters suffer for it in a major way. Overall: I agree Batman Returns had flaws. Batman Return has a somber tone punctuated with ridiculousness, but it's watchable. I can't say the same with its follow ups: 1995's Batman Forever and 1997's Batman & Robin. Those movies nearly ruin batman until Nolan step in with 2005's Batman Begins. Still, glad Tim Burton didn't made another Batman after this.

    Batman Returns was a major disappointment to me. When I saw the first Batman in this series, I loved it (mostly due to Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker). The thing about these original Batman movies is that they put the majority of the focus on the villains. The Joker was a complete show maker in the last one, but this one includes Danny DeVito as the Penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman. While both actors did a good job, the two different stories of the Penguin and Cat Woman did not make a good combination. The Penguins story was depressing which added gloom to the story, and Cat Woman's story was disturbing which added darkness to the story. Put them together and you have a movie that's disturbingly depressing (or Depressingly Disturbing which ever you prefer.) Batman himself was played for the last time by Michael Keaton. A lot of people were mad when Keaton didn't return in the last two films for this series but personally I was OK with it. It's not that I think that he's a bad actor, as much as I think that he wasn't a convincing Batman (he doesn't look the part for starters). The rest of the acting was good. Particularly Christopher Walken as Max. He did a great job. I just don't think that a movie that doubles up on negative emotions is a good way to get buyers. And so thus, after one successful movie, the Batman franchise began to fail.

    Hello readers, I am back with another review, this time about one of the most controversial super-hero movies of all time, BATMAN RETURNS. The film opens with a young penguin being thrown into the sewer by his hateful parents. This calls for Danny Elfman's new musical score to come in. Already I can see how dark this film is going to be than the previous. The reason of this is that Tim Burton had the freedom to make a Batman film the way he liked it which makes for a bizarre and Gothic entry... due to the great success of the first installment that is. So the film then proceeds with an awesome action scene where Batman returns. Then we get a scene with Max Shrek confronting the Penguin played by Danny DeVito who is so freaky and compelling in this film. I always wondered, who the hell taught The Penguin how to talk? The scene is quite scary and now we are finally assured that we are in for one hell of "BURTON" type film. Why didn't he just make another film with this kind of style, why do it to poor Batman? Anyway Max Shrek throws Selina Kyle out of a window and when she lays on the ground a pack of cats start well ravaging her until she comes too in a frightening scene. We then get a scene of Selina loosing her mind thus becoming the film's second villain, Catwoman. The rest of the film drags with fake action scenes and bizarre confrontations. They film becomes very un-enjoyable during the half way point and just becomes ultimately weird. I mean look at all these scenes, there's the bit when Penguin bites this guys nose, Penguin eats a raw fish, Catwoman and Batman get all frisky and it just seems to be more of a BEETLE JUICE film than a Batman film. I mean seriously Tim, why not just make your own bloody movie! Why just completely weird-out the Batman series and thus create Batman Forever! Along with the just as bad Batman And Robin. After a mind bendingly stupid plan by The Penguin we reach the final battle which features a pretty cool scene with Michael Keaton turning around to see the helpless Penguin as sparks pop behind him. So the film finishes with a mystery which leaves me hoping for another Burton film which was never made due to parents, believe it or not! That's your fault for making it all dark and weird Tim! And, yeah the film is OK and with no doubt isn't as bad as most claim but here ends my review for Batman Returns, the wonderfully different entry to the Batman legacy. See you soon for further reviews or you can check out my previous ones...

    Equally magnificent sequel has Michael Keaton returning as Bruce Wayne/Batman, only here is opposed by the double threat of Catwoman(marvelously played by the sultry Michele Pfeiffer) who starts off as harried secretary Selina Kyle, who is transformed into Catwoman after a betrayal. They develop a close relationship, since they both have a great deal in common... Danny DeVito portrays Oswald Cobblepot/the Penquin, who was a deformed child brought up in the sewers of Gotham, and now heads a criminal gang. DeVito effectively plays the pathos of this man, who can't decide if he wants to re-enter society or not, but a dramatic turn-of-events pushes him over the edge... Filled with fantastic action, set design, and music score, this production is another triumph, one of the few sequels to match the original, even though some feel it is too dark, the subject matter suits this. A great pity that star Michael Keaton and director Tim Burton stopped here, and didn't get the chance to do a trilogy, since the new team drove this series off the rails...A shame that.

    This is one of those movies that's going to affect your opinion of it in weird ways, the more you think of it. For some this is a movie that got better with time, and for many others it only had gotten worse. Unfortunately the latter has happened for me, and to be honest there was a time when I gave it at least a 7, because I thought as a Tim Burton movie, and not a Batman movie, it succeeded, but then I re-visited it to only find that it's more a carbon copy of one of his past works. That movie is possibly his most critically acclaimed movie Edward Scissorhands, which is actually good on its own merits, but it's not necessarily a movie that can be redone to great success. Why I say this about Returns is that right from the get go we as viewers don't feel like we're in Gotham anymore, but really just this small claustrophobic set, that doesn't feel quite as large as the Gotham seen in the first movie, but more let the sets to Scissorhands which also had an ironic Christmas setting. Notably the most obvious parallel, other than the whole Christmas setting, is that Edward and Oswald 'The Penguin' have the same makeup job. Another thing the two have in common that Burton has been doing for awhile now is that he always feels the need to have outcasts in his stories, that he wants you to feel sad for, which for a sympathetic character like Edward you would, but with characters such as The Penguin who are just naturally sick, twisted, and villainous, you really don't. The story for this doesn't have one narrative form to stick to, therefore the story itself really doesn't seem to know which character is really the protagonist. It should be Batman, but even much more so than in the original one he's so hidden from the audience that it's hard to care for many of the things that happen to him. What fascinates me, is when they present an interesting idea for him to get involved in, it chooses to not have enough focus on that. What I mostly refer to is his relationship with Selina/Catwoman, having a character that has similar qualities to the hero can make for a very interesting love relationship, but as you see in the movie they really only give the Bruce/Selina aspect 2-3 small scenes to do it justice, and her Catwoman facet is hard to read, as she seemingly tries seducing Batman to get the better of him not to find a relationship in him, leaving another plot thread that could've had further development through that side of it, but in the end resorts to it just feeling very unfinished. Now Michelle Pfeiffer's performance overall is okay, it's just that I really couldn't take her seriously as a character, which is ironic considering that she's probably the only character with an emotional arc in it. I think the reason why is that despite Burton trying to go for a somewhat darker tone, he still put in lots of silly, campy, cartoon humor that somewhat makes some of the performances like Michelle's feels unbalanced, because they ask us to care about an emotional arc that she has that kind of gets suffocated in the paraphernalia of the character, and the same goes for Danny as the Penguin. Tim Burton has recently stated that he now feels that his Batman movies look like lighthearted romps these days, and I can definitely see why he said that. I'm not implying that there shouldn't be any humor in it, but don't put so much in it that it feels forced. For me, and I think many others, the best thing to come out of this movie was the Danny Elfman score, a composer that's consistently coming up with great musical ideas for whatever movie he works on. Another positive thing about the movie that I can say is that even though the character of Max Schreck is written uninteresting, Christopher Walken makes it interesting by just being there, playing himself almost. I would compliment the visuals as being inspired, but now that I've revisited the movie, I can say that it's stuff borrowed from Burton's movie before this Edward Scissorhands, and I'd also add that visuals don't have much of a meaning without a meaningful story. ****

    Usually doing a second film no matter what the genre is. Is a good thing. It takes it to another level. My experience with Batman Returns was still pretty good. But not as enjoyable than the first film that was made in (1989). Michael Keaton returns to the franchise. I definitely think he's the best Batman of all time. George Clooney sucked. And whoever else played him was awful. This was a terrific choice for an actor. All of the special effects can get a little goofy at times. It has some intense scenes though. In my opinion this film is for kids age: 12 and up. So I give this movie a thumbs up. The first film gets two thumbs up. It was amazing. This one wasn't amazing. But it did continue the story in a nice way. The style of the camera shots were good. The close ups were nice. And overall the film did have its moments. So it's not awful. If you're a true Batman fan see it.

    First of all, and I think you would agree, that the second movie off any film is not as good as the first one. With Batman returns this was the case. Not great, but still good. Keaton still makes a good batman. The bat suite was tampered with a little bit but it mostly looks the same. But yet again the story of how the villain became a villain was told. Not how batman was created. This time two villains had risen, the penguin and cat-woman. The penguin was a bit overdone for my liking, his huge nose, three fingers on each hand, funny shaped body and hi even living with penguins! Gosh I wonder what they were trying to say? Is he maybe half penguin? Still Danny deVito played it well. Catwoman is a bit far-fetched. She was really made from the likes of cats.not better than batman, but surely worth having a look

    People are going to think I'm crazy, but I actually like this film is better than the previous, even better than most of Christopher Nolan's franchise. This is probably where the Batman series got to its darkest. I'm not just saying that due to the Gothic setting and down-beat atmosphere, but also because of the tension that builds between each of the main characters. The Bat, the Cat, and the Penguin are trying to identify themselves among everyone else in their lives. The film portrays this intensity by showing they are more connected than they realize. To me, the film, in its own right, is a masterpiece. There is fantastic acting, beautiful imagery, interesting plots and even an incredible soundtrack by Danny Elfman. This was, unfortunately, the last Batman film with Tim Burton as director. Fans then had to see the horrors of... well... just read my review for Batman Forever.

    Ah, heres a movie I remember fondly from my childhood. Man I had it all, the toys, the McDonald's happy meal toys (not to mention those cool large plastic McDonald's cups my mom bought me) the sega video game, the trading cards, the t shirts, the batmobile candy dispensers, all kinds of neat merch based on the movie. of course in retrospect, this is not at all a kids movie, despite the fact its batman and was aimed at kids who bought happy meals. but that doesn't mean its not a great movie. not every superhero movie has to cater strictly to the kids. nevertheless, my 6 year old self was too in love with batman to care about how dark it was, I still loved anything and everything having to do with my favorite superhero and I must have watched this movie, along with the other 2 movies (1989 batman and batman forever) a zillion times on video. here's the premise. Batman truly does Return in this sequel to the 1989 mega hit, and this time hes better then ever. hes got some new toys (like the electronic self-targeting Baterang), vehicles and even has 2 new classic villains to contend with. penguin is a classic Tim Burton character in this one, but that can only be a good thing. in this movie, Burton makes the characters very ambiguous. is the penguin really half animal, half human? is cat woman part cat, part woman? these questions never really get answered. personally, i don't believe they are part animal at all. the penguin is all human albeit a VERY deformed and ugly one, and is only called Penguin because of his deformities. Catwoman is always human but the whole "9 lives" thing makes it ambiguous whether she has supernatural powers or whether shes just very lucky. its debatable. Batman is the only normal guy in this. in fact, Keaton being the calm cool hero both as Bruce Wayne and batman, grounds the movie and keeps it together whereas the 2 villains are completely crazy and psychotic nut cases. it seemed Keaton didn't have it all together in the last movie, he had a a lot of demons to fight with, but by the end you got the feeling he found his purpose in life, now that hes got a bat-signal and the law on his side. so naturally, in this one he seems more together and knows what hes doing. its the villains who are not together and have all these obvious mental problems, so much so that they actually make batman look normal. if it was anyone else playing batman, it wouldn't have worked. but Michael Keaton has a unique screen presence that when he puts on the bat suit, he literally IS batman and lets face it, no one before or since has had the manly swagger that Michael Keaton had as batman. he was a bit older, getting some greys, was this sort of gruff everyman but has this seriousness and "normal guy" look that makes you take him seriously as batman. other actors who have played batman seem too pretty boy or hand picked and thus don't feel real. Keaton is like the everyman normal looking 40 year old gruff guy and he demands you take him seriously. this is a very artsy film, compared to its blockbuster brother from 1989, which was basically a cut-&-dry blockbuster action/adventure. but it really didn't have any emotion or depth to it, despite Keaton's sincere efforts. Thats where Returns comes in. all the characters are very interesting and in a way, they all echo Batman. Catwoman is the dark vigilante side of him, while the Penguin shows what Bruce Wayne could have been if he turned bitter against the world. I've heard many ppl say that this batman film is not really about Batman himself, and that too much attention is given to the villains, but i will say again, its not a bad thing, and doesn't ruin this film. batman himself is really not a very interesting character when you think about it. hes essentially a guy who's see's his parents get killed as a kid, he trains for X years, then decides to becomes batman for revenge purposes. OK. thats it. there's no more to it really. certainly not something i want to watch for a whole 2 hours. i really didn't see a point in making a whole movie about his origin a couple years ago, i think it was a waste. i was always kinda hoping they would bring back the Burton style of filmaking for batman movies, or maybe even get Burton back to direct. but alas, we got something that felt like a lesser version of the 1989 film. sad. but hey, we always have the Tim Burton films to enjoy. those, IMO, captured the real batman, beyond the facade of "comic book" movie looks (which, in Burton's case, is actually a good thing). as far as i'm concerned, Burton is the only guy to have directed Batman movies. hes the only one who i believed truly understood batman, as you can see in his various films. the other directors never really...got it. they just don't get batman. they only got him as a character, thats it. but Burton KNEW batman, he understood his plight in life, and the darkness inherent in the material. thats why this is to me, the best, and most personal, Batman film. it shows batman, and his villains, at there most raw. they are all hurt individuals, and thats what makes this film so powerful. this is what a batman film should be. serious, witty, playful, phycological, and DARK. while still retaining the comic book style that we all expect. this film also paved the way for the wonderful Batman: The Animated Series, which also shares Tim Burton's dark, Gothic look and feel from both of his Batman films. it even uses the same theme!

If only they had the betrayal by the city folks drives him insane and he tries to destroy the society that spurned and abused him would make an excellent movie rather than Penguin looking like a monster dimwit with his multiplies fails plots like getting revenge on Gotham socialites by abducting and killing their infant or blowing the city with penguin carrying missiles. As much as I like Christopher Walken and his President Andrew Jackson's hairdo, the story could have done without his character. I know Shreck is the bad-guy of the film that needed to put Selena on her quest for revenge and track towards insanity. You can easier fit Penguin in that role. The best part of the film is the conflict & romance of Selena and Bruce that should had been the main focal point of the film. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) and Selina Kyle. Pfeiffer and Keaton both give great performances, and their on-screen chemistry is excellent. If the main focus had been on developing their relationship it would have been a great movie. As it is, just a handful of short scenes together simply didn't cut it. The sequence with Bruce and Selena at the party was the best scene in the film. The conflict and chemistry between the two draws you in, especially when watching Selena's own problems with mounting insanity. Still, don't know how she became a master of kung-fu. I love Michelle's catwoman more than Anna Hatchaway in 2012's Dark Knight's Rises. As much as I love Michelle, Anne Hathaway comes the closest to portraying Catwoman from the comics as far as the movies goes. Still, Michael Keaton was the best Batman. The mischaracterizations of Batman from the first film are carried over and amplified here. Batman is murderous, and remorseless. True, Batman originally carried a gun and killed, but that aspect of the character didn't survive the first year of an 80+ year run, and is not really a valid interpretation of the character anymore. Batman doesn't murder people. Thank God, Marlon Wayans wasn't portraying Robin and Robin was cut out. The inconsistent tone of the film also works against it. Burton presents a very bleak, grim, nihilistic serious story, where the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are monsters. He them loads the film with absurdist camp set pieces, but plays them straight and seems to expect the audience to take them seriously. This causes the tone to shift wildly, and the audience ends up laughing at things meant to be taken seriously and taking jokes at face value. Artistic license is one thing, but these characters got the worst of the Burton treatment, and both characters suffer for it in a major way. Overall: I agree Batman Returns had flaws. Batman Return has a somber tone punctuated with ridiculousness, but it's watchable. I can't say the same with its follow ups: 1995's Batman Forever and 1997's Batman & Robin. Those movies nearly ruin batman until Nolan step in with 2005's Batman Begins. Still, glad Tim Burton didn't made another Batman after this.

    Batman Returns was a major disappointment to me. When I saw the first Batman in this series, I loved it (mostly due to Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker). The thing about these original Batman movies is that they put the majority of the focus on the villains. The Joker was a complete show maker in the last one, but this one includes Danny DeVito as the Penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman. While both actors did a good job, the two different stories of the Penguin and Cat Woman did not make a good combination. The Penguins story was depressing which added gloom to the story, and Cat Woman's story was disturbing which added darkness to the story. Put them together and you have a movie that's disturbingly depressing (or Depressingly Disturbing which ever you prefer.) Batman himself was played for the last time by Michael Keaton. A lot of people were mad when Keaton didn't return in the last two films for this series but personally I was OK with it. It's not that I think that he's a bad actor, as much as I think that he wasn't a convincing Batman (he doesn't look the part for starters). The rest of the acting was good. Particularly Christopher Walken as Max. He did a great job. I just don't think that a movie that doubles up on negative emotions is a good way to get buyers. And so thus, after one successful movie, the Batman franchise began to fail.

    Hello readers, I am back with another review, this time about one of the most controversial super-hero movies of all time, BATMAN RETURNS. The film opens with a young penguin being thrown into the sewer by his hateful parents. This calls for Danny Elfman's new musical score to come in. Already I can see how dark this film is going to be than the previous. The reason of this is that Tim Burton had the freedom to make a Batman film the way he liked it which makes for a bizarre and Gothic entry... due to the great success of the first installment that is. So the film then proceeds with an awesome action scene where Batman returns. Then we get a scene with Max Shrek confronting the Penguin played by Danny DeVito who is so freaky and compelling in this film. I always wondered, who the hell taught The Penguin how to talk? The scene is quite scary and now we are finally assured that we are in for one hell of "BURTON" type film. Why didn't he just make another film with this kind of style, why do it to poor Batman? Anyway Max Shrek throws Selina Kyle out of a window and when she lays on the ground a pack of cats start well ravaging her until she comes too in a frightening scene. We then get a scene of Selina loosing her mind thus becoming the film's second villain, Catwoman. The rest of the film drags with fake action scenes and bizarre confrontations. They film becomes very un-enjoyable during the half way point and just becomes ultimately weird. I mean look at all these scenes, there's the bit when Penguin bites this guys nose, Penguin eats a raw fish, Catwoman and Batman get all frisky and it just seems to be more of a BEETLE JUICE film than a Batman film. I mean seriously Tim, why not just make your own bloody movie! Why just completely weird-out the Batman series and thus create Batman Forever! Along with the just as bad Batman And Robin. After a mind bendingly stupid plan by The Penguin we reach the final battle which features a pretty cool scene with Michael Keaton turning around to see the helpless Penguin as sparks pop behind him. So the film finishes with a mystery which leaves me hoping for another Burton film which was never made due to parents, believe it or not! That's your fault for making it all dark and weird Tim! And, yeah the film is OK and with no doubt isn't as bad as most claim but here ends my review for Batman Returns, the wonderfully different entry to the Batman legacy. See you soon for further reviews or you can check out my previous ones...

    Equally magnificent sequel has Michael Keaton returning as Bruce Wayne/Batman, only here is opposed by the double threat of Catwoman(marvelously played by the sultry Michele Pfeiffer) who starts off as harried secretary Selina Kyle, who is transformed into Catwoman after a betrayal. They develop a close relationship, since they both have a great deal in common... Danny DeVito portrays Oswald Cobblepot/the Penquin, who was a deformed child brought up in the sewers of Gotham, and now heads a criminal gang. DeVito effectively plays the pathos of this man, who can't decide if he wants to re-enter society or not, but a dramatic turn-of-events pushes him over the edge... Filled with fantastic action, set design, and music score, this production is another triumph, one of the few sequels to match the original, even though some feel it is too dark, the subject matter suits this. A great pity that star Michael Keaton and director Tim Burton stopped here, and didn't get the chance to do a trilogy, since the new team drove this series off the rails...A shame that.

    This is one of those movies that's going to affect your opinion of it in weird ways, the more you think of it. For some this is a movie that got better with time, and for many others it only had gotten worse. Unfortunately the latter has happened for me, and to be honest there was a time when I gave it at least a 7, because I thought as a Tim Burton movie, and not a Batman movie, it succeeded, but then I re-visited it to only find that it's more a carbon copy of one of his past works. That movie is possibly his most critically acclaimed movie Edward Scissorhands, which is actually good on its own merits, but it's not necessarily a movie that can be redone to great success. Why I say this about Returns is that right from the get go we as viewers don't feel like we're in Gotham anymore, but really just this small claustrophobic set, that doesn't feel quite as large as the Gotham seen in the first movie, but more let the sets to Scissorhands which also had an ironic Christmas setting. Notably the most obvious parallel, other than the whole Christmas setting, is that Edward and Oswald 'The Penguin' have the same makeup job. Another thing the two have in common that Burton has been doing for awhile now is that he always feels the need to have outcasts in his stories, that he wants you to feel sad for, which for a sympathetic character like Edward you would, but with characters such as The Penguin who are just naturally sick, twisted, and villainous, you really don't. The story for this doesn't have one narrative form to stick to, therefore the story itself really doesn't seem to know which character is really the protagonist. It should be Batman, but even much more so than in the original one he's so hidden from the audience that it's hard to care for many of the things that happen to him. What fascinates me, is when they present an interesting idea for him to get involved in, it chooses to not have enough focus on that. What I mostly refer to is his relationship with Selina/Catwoman, having a character that has similar qualities to the hero can make for a very interesting love relationship, but as you see in the movie they really only give the Bruce/Selina aspect 2-3 small scenes to do it justice, and her Catwoman facet is hard to read, as she seemingly tries seducing Batman to get the better of him not to find a relationship in him, leaving another plot thread that could've had further development through that side of it, but in the end resorts to it just feeling very unfinished. Now Michelle Pfeiffer's performance overall is okay, it's just that I really couldn't take her seriously as a character, which is ironic considering that she's probably the only character with an emotional arc in it. I think the reason why is that despite Burton trying to go for a somewhat darker tone, he still put in lots of silly, campy, cartoon humor that somewhat makes some of the performances like Michelle's feels unbalanced, because they ask us to care about an emotional arc that she has that kind of gets suffocated in the paraphernalia of the character, and the same goes for Danny as the Penguin. Tim Burton has recently stated that he now feels that his Batman movies look like lighthearted romps these days, and I can definitely see why he said that. I'm not implying that there shouldn't be any humor in it, but don't put so much in it that it feels forced. For me, and I think many others, the best thing to come out of this movie was the Danny Elfman score, a composer that's consistently coming up with great musical ideas for whatever movie he works on. Another positive thing about the movie that I can say is that even though the character of Max Schreck is written uninteresting, Christopher Walken makes it interesting by just being there, playing himself almost. I would compliment the visuals as being inspired, but now that I've revisited the movie, I can say that it's stuff borrowed from Burton's movie before this Edward Scissorhands, and I'd also add that visuals don't have much of a meaning without a meaningful story. ****

    Usually doing a second film no matter what the genre is. Is a good thing. It takes it to another level. My experience with Batman Returns was still pretty good. But not as enjoyable than the first film that was made in (1989). Michael Keaton returns to the franchise. I definitely think he's the best Batman of all time. George Clooney sucked. And whoever else played him was awful. This was a terrific choice for an actor. All of the special effects can get a little goofy at times. It has some intense scenes though. In my opinion this film is for kids age: 12 and up. So I give this movie a thumbs up. The first film gets two thumbs up. It was amazing. This one wasn't amazing. But it did continue the story in a nice way. The style of the camera shots were good. The close ups were nice. And overall the film did have its moments. So it's not awful. If you're a true Batman fan see it.

    First of all, and I think you would agree, that the second movie off any film is not as good as the first one. With Batman returns this was the case. Not great, but still good. Keaton still makes a good batman. The bat suite was tampered with a little bit but it mostly looks the same. But yet again the story of how the villain became a villain was told. Not how batman was created. This time two villains had risen, the penguin and cat-woman. The penguin was a bit overdone for my liking, his huge nose, three fingers on each hand, funny shaped body and hi even living with penguins! Gosh I wonder what they were trying to say? Is he maybe half penguin? Still Danny deVito played it well. Catwoman is a bit far-fetched. She was really made from the likes of cats.not better than batman, but surely worth having a look

    People are going to think I'm crazy, but I actually like this film is better than the previous, even better than most of Christopher Nolan's franchise. This is probably where the Batman series got to its darkest. I'm not just saying that due to the Gothic setting and down-beat atmosphere, but also because of the tension that builds between each of the main characters. The Bat, the Cat, and the Penguin are trying to identify themselves among everyone else in their lives. The film portrays this intensity by showing they are more connected than they realize. To me, the film, in its own right, is a masterpiece. There is fantastic acting, beautiful imagery, interesting plots and even an incredible soundtrack by Danny Elfman. This was, unfortunately, the last Batman film with Tim Burton as director. Fans then had to see the horrors of... well... just read my review for Batman Forever.

    Ah, heres a movie I remember fondly from my childhood. Man I had it all, the toys, the McDonald's happy meal toys (not to mention those cool large plastic McDonald's cups my mom bought me) the sega video game, the trading cards, the t shirts, the batmobile candy dispensers, all kinds of neat merch based on the movie. of course in retrospect, this is not at all a kids movie, despite the fact its batman and was aimed at kids who bought happy meals. but that doesn't mean its not a great movie. not every superhero movie has to cater strictly to the kids. nevertheless, my 6 year old self was too in love with batman to care about how dark it was, I still loved anything and everything having to do with my favorite superhero and I must have watched this movie, along with the other 2 movies (1989 batman and batman forever) a zillion times on video. here's the premise. Batman truly does Return in this sequel to the 1989 mega hit, and this time hes better then ever. hes got some new toys (like the electronic self-targeting Baterang), vehicles and even has 2 new classic villains to contend with. penguin is a classic Tim Burton character in this one, but that can only be a good thing. in this movie, Burton makes the characters very ambiguous. is the penguin really half animal, half human? is cat woman part cat, part woman? these questions never really get answered. personally, i don't believe they are part animal at all. the penguin is all human albeit a VERY deformed and ugly one, and is only called Penguin because of his deformities. Catwoman is always human but the whole "9 lives" thing makes it ambiguous whether she has supernatural powers or whether shes just very lucky. its debatable. Batman is the only normal guy in this. in fact, Keaton being the calm cool hero both as Bruce Wayne and batman, grounds the movie and keeps it together whereas the 2 villains are completely crazy and psychotic nut cases. it seemed Keaton didn't have it all together in the last movie, he had a a lot of demons to fight with, but by the end you got the feeling he found his purpose in life, now that hes got a bat-signal and the law on his side. so naturally, in this one he seems more together and knows what hes doing. its the villains who are not together and have all these obvious mental problems, so much so that they actually make batman look normal. if it was anyone else playing batman, it wouldn't have worked. but Michael Keaton has a unique screen presence that when he puts on the bat suit, he literally IS batman and lets face it, no one before or since has had the manly swagger that Michael Keaton had as batman. he was a bit older, getting some greys, was this sort of gruff everyman but has this seriousness and "normal guy" look that makes you take him seriously as batman. other actors who have played batman seem too pretty boy or hand picked and thus don't feel real. Keaton is like the everyman normal looking 40 year old gruff guy and he demands you take him seriously. this is a very artsy film, compared to its blockbuster brother from 1989, which was basically a cut-&-dry blockbuster action/adventure. but it really didn't have any emotion or depth to it, despite Keaton's sincere efforts. Thats where Returns comes in. all the characters are very interesting and in a way, they all echo Batman. Catwoman is the dark vigilante side of him, while the Penguin shows what Bruce Wayne could have been if he turned bitter against the world. I've heard many ppl say that this batman film is not really about Batman himself, and that too much attention is given to the villains, but i will say again, its not a bad thing, and doesn't ruin this film. batman himself is really not a very interesting character when you think about it. hes essentially a guy who's see's his parents get killed as a kid, he trains for X years, then decides to becomes batman for revenge purposes. OK. thats it. there's no more to it really. certainly not something i want to watch for a whole 2 hours. i really didn't see a point in making a whole movie about his origin a couple years ago, i think it was a waste. i was always kinda hoping they would bring back the Burton style of filmaking for batman movies, or maybe even get Burton back to direct. but alas, we got something that felt like a lesser version of the 1989 film. sad. but hey, we always have the Tim Burton films to enjoy. those, IMO, captured the real batman, beyond the facade of "comic book" movie looks (which, in Burton's case, is actually a good thing). as far as i'm concerned, Burton is the only guy to have directed Batman movies. hes the only one who i believed truly understood batman, as you can see in his various films. the other directors never really...got it. they just don't get batman. they only got him as a character, thats it. but Burton KNEW batman, he understood his plight in life, and the darkness inherent in the material. thats why this is to me, the best, and most personal, Batman film. it shows batman, and his villains, at there most raw. they are all hurt individuals, and thats what makes this film so powerful. this is what a batman film should be. serious, witty, playful, phycological, and DARK. while still retaining the comic book style that we all expect. this film also paved the way for the wonderful Batman: The Animated Series, which also shares Tim Burton's dark, Gothic look and feel from both of his Batman films. it even uses the same theme!

    My friends will know I have a mixed opinion of Nolans batman films. Begins was dull, TDK was pretty cool and TDKR....well, we have batman and robin to contend with worst batman movie. I say this as my friends say "the old films are to light hearted" I reply "Go watch batman returns" This film takes influences both from Batman and Burton's film he made just before this, Edward Scissorhands. The latter was Burton's personal favourite film, and for this film, he wanted to bring something new to the table. Batman returns has the Gothic, almost fairy tale like feel of Scissorhands-a dark, twisted fairy tale anyway. This is due to impressive production design, and Danny Elfmans score, which has the choir elements added in for that Burton feel. Keaton returns and once again impresses as batman. He isn't in that much (more than in TDKR though) but he brings a real pressence on screen. He is in my eyes the true Batman. Danny DeVito is the warped penguin and he is a very interesting, if vile, character. A great costume and make up team make him a great villain. Although he is not the crime boss from the comics, the abandoned mutant makes him a more sympathetic villain- only Aaron Eckhart is more sympathetic than penguin in the batman films. Michelle Pfeiffer is the scene stealer here as catwomen. Her demented take on the anti hero is very engaging and she has one of the coolest costumes ever. Finally Christopher Walken appears as corrupt tycoon Max Schrek. He is basically playing himself-which is awesome, as he is Christopher Walken. So we have a strong cast-what about the story? While it's morbid and dark, it's very interesting. Its complex and not realistic but is very powerful-but not uplifting. As for the production, Gotham looks as dark as it will ever look-its mostly set at night. Its a memroble setting, but not comic book-y-more Tim Burton-y. The music gets the tone of the film across very well-Danny Elfman has composed a real gem here. The action however is a bit lackluster-the music holds it together, making it seem more exciting. The biggest problem the film has is that its not a comic book movie-it does change the villains backstories, batman is slightly to immoral and the story doesn't have the simple plots or action to make it a comic book movie. Although its not the best representation of batman or comic book movies, and a disappointment compared to its predecessor, its a great watch if your into the dark worlds of Tim Burton-defiantly the dark knights darkest hour.

    I'll go ahead and say it, Batman Returns is my favorite Batman movie. As much as I love Nolan's Batman films such like 2008's Dark Knight for making more sense and realistic. I like how fun Batman Returns is. Yes, it's campy, creepy, and the plot makes little to no sense, still it's a lot of fun for me. Don't get me wrong, Nolan's films are superior movies over Tim Burton's mediocre films, but there is something about Batman Returns that get me watching all the time when it's on, TV. I think it's because it's feels like a creepy comic book movie. For me, this isn't supposed to be remotely realistic, this is a straight up fantasy. It has that old school horror movie feel to it. I love the Danny Elfman score, the cinematography, the set design, the ghoulish and semi-camp German Expressionism tone. I can see why it was too frightening for children to the point that parents got rid of the Batman Returns Happy Meals and didn't allow the kids to watch it. There were serious WTF moments in the film that pretty damn dark like Penguin (Danny Devito) eating a man's nose, a baby being abandon, sexually depraved dialogues between the Penguin and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and countless deaths. But seriously did any of these children ever see The Dark Knight? I have to say that, pretty scary and violence as well. Honestly, it's the parent's choice to allow their kids to watch it or not. Thank God, my parents allow me to see it because it's the film that made me a fan of Batman. This movie is messy, nonsensical and heavily flawed and I still love it. The movie starts out Penguin being abandoned by his parents because of his physical deformities when a child, he then tries to rejoin humanity with the help of a businessmen Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who then uses him as a part of his plot to allow his business to continue to operate free from government oversight by asking him to become mayor after the city start to sympathize him for what his parents did to him. What the film does wrong, is make him a villain outright without much character development. Rather than getting abused and tossed aside just at the moment when he almost begins to believe that perhaps he is capable of being respected and that people may not be so bad, the film makes him deranged, terrorist and the monstrous psychopath bear little resemblance to the savvy, anti-heroic thief or the neutral informant businessman of the comics. If only they had the betrayal by the city folks drives him insane and he tries to destroy the society that spurned and abused him would make an excellent movie rather than Penguin looking like a monster dimwit with his multiplies fails plots like getting revenge on Gotham socialites by abducting and killing their infant or blowing the city with penguin carrying missiles. As much as I like Christopher Walken and his President Andrew Jackson's hairdo, the story could have done without his character. I know Shreck is the bad-guy of the film that needed to put Selena on her quest for revenge and track towards insanity. You can easier fit Penguin in that role. The best part of the film is the conflict & romance of Selena and Bruce that should had been the main focal point of the film. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) and Selina Kyle. Pfeiffer and Keaton both give great performances, and their on-screen chemistry is excellent. If the main focus had been on developing their relationship it would have been a great movie. As it is, just a handful of short scenes together simply didn't cut it. The sequence with Bruce and Selena at the party was the best scene in the film. The conflict and chemistry between the two draws you in, especially when watching Selena's own problems with mounting insanity. Still, don't know how she became a master of kung-fu. I love Michelle's catwoman more than Anna Hatchaway in 2012's Dark Knight's Rises. As much as I love Michelle, Anne Hathaway comes the closest to portraying Catwoman from the comics as far as the movies goes. Still, Michael Keaton was the best Batman. The mischaracterizations of Batman from the first film are carried over and amplified here. Batman is murderous, and remorseless. True, Batman originally carried a gun and killed, but that aspect of the character didn't survive the first year of an 80+ year run, and is not really a valid interpretation of the character anymore. Batman doesn't murder people. Thank God, Marlon Wayans wasn't portraying Robin and Robin was cut out. The inconsistent tone of the film also works against it. Burton presents a very bleak, grim, nihilistic serious story, where the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are monsters. He them loads the film with absurdist camp set pieces, but plays them straight and seems to expect the audience to take them seriously. This causes the tone to shift wildly, and the audience ends up laughing at things meant to be taken seriously and taking jokes at face value. Artistic license is one thing, but these characters got the worst of the Burton treatment, and both characters suffer for it in a major way. Overall: I agree Batman Returns had flaws. Batman Return has a somber tone punctuated with ridiculousness, but it's watchable. I can't say the same with its follow ups: 1995's Batman Forever and 1997's Batman & Robin. Those movies nearly ruin batman until Nolan step in with 2005's Batman Begins. Still, glad Tim Burton didn't made another Batman after this.

    Batman Returns was a major disappointment to me. When I saw the first Batman in this series, I loved it (mostly due to Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker). The thing about these original Batman movies is that they put the majority of the focus on the villains. The Joker was a complete show maker in the last one, but this one includes Danny DeVito as the Penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman. While both actors did a good job, the two different stories of the Penguin and Cat Woman did not make a good combination. The Penguins story was depressing which added gloom to the story, and Cat Woman's story was disturbing which added darkness to the story. Put them together and you have a movie that's disturbingly depressing (or Depressingly Disturbing which ever you prefer.) Batman himself was played for the last time by Michael Keaton. A lot of people were mad when Keaton didn't return in the last two films for this series but personally I was OK with it. It's not that I think that he's a bad actor, as much as I think that he wasn't a convincing Batman (he doesn't look the part for starters). The rest of the acting was good. Particularly Christopher Walken as Max. He did a great job. I just don't think that a movie that doubles up on negative emotions is a good way to get buyers. And so thus, after one successful movie, the Batman franchise began to fail.

    Hello readers, I am back with another review, this time about one of the most controversial super-hero movies of all time, BATMAN RETURNS. The film opens with a young penguin being thrown into the sewer by his hateful parents. This calls for Danny Elfman's new musical score to come in. Already I can see how dark this film is going to be than the previous. The reason of this is that Tim Burton had the freedom to make a Batman film the way he liked it which makes for a bizarre and Gothic entry... due to the great success of the first installment that is. So the film then proceeds with an awesome action scene where Batman returns. Then we get a scene with Max Shrek confronting the Penguin played by Danny DeVito who is so freaky and compelling in this film. I always wondered, who the hell taught The Penguin how to talk? The scene is quite scary and now we are finally assured that we are in for one hell of "BURTON" type film. Why didn't he just make another film with this kind of style, why do it to poor Batman? Anyway Max Shrek throws Selina Kyle out of a window and when she lays on the ground a pack of cats start well ravaging her until she comes too in a frightening scene. We then get a scene of Selina loosing her mind thus becoming the film's second villain, Catwoman. The rest of the film drags with fake action scenes and bizarre confrontations. They film becomes very un-enjoyable during the half way point and just becomes ultimately weird. I mean look at all these scenes, there's the bit when Penguin bites this guys nose, Penguin eats a raw fish, Catwoman and Batman get all frisky and it just seems to be more of a BEETLE JUICE film than a Batman film. I mean seriously Tim, why not just make your own bloody movie! Why just completely weird-out the Batman series and thus create Batman Forever! Along with the just as bad Batman And Robin. After a mind bendingly stupid plan by The Penguin we reach the final battle which features a pretty cool scene with Michael Keaton turning around to see the helpless Penguin as sparks pop behind him. So the film finishes with a mystery which leaves me hoping for another Burton film which was never made due to parents, believe it or not! That's your fault for making it all dark and weird Tim! And, yeah the film is OK and with no doubt isn't as bad as most claim but here ends my review for Batman Returns, the wonderfully different entry to the Batman legacy. See you soon for further reviews or you can check out my previous ones...

    Equally magnificent sequel has Michael Keaton returning as Bruce Wayne/Batman, only here is opposed by the double threat of Catwoman(marvelously played by the sultry Michele Pfeiffer) who starts off as harried secretary Selina Kyle, who is transformed into Catwoman after a betrayal. They develop a close relationship, since they both have a great deal in common... Danny DeVito portrays Oswald Cobblepot/the Penquin, who was a deformed child brought up in the sewers of Gotham, and now heads a criminal gang. DeVito effectively plays the pathos of this man, who can't decide if he wants to re-enter society or not, but a dramatic turn-of-events pushes him over the edge... Filled with fantastic action, set design, and music score, this production is another triumph, one of the few sequels to match the original, even though some feel it is too dark, the subject matter suits this. A great pity that star Michael Keaton and director Tim Burton stopped here, and didn't get the chance to do a trilogy, since the new team drove this series off the rails...A shame that.

    This is one of those movies that's going to affect your opinion of it in weird ways, the more you think of it. For some this is a movie that got better with time, and for many others it only had gotten worse. Unfortunately the latter has happened for me, and to be honest there was a time when I gave it at least a 7, because I thought as a Tim Burton movie, and not a Batman movie, it succeeded, but then I re-visited it to only find that it's more a carbon copy of one of his past works. That movie is possibly his most critically acclaimed movie Edward Scissorhands, which is actually good on its own merits, but it's not necessarily a movie that can be redone to great success. Why I say this about Returns is that right from the get go we as viewers don't feel like we're in Gotham anymore, but really just this small claustrophobic set, that doesn't feel quite as large as the Gotham seen in the first movie, but more let the sets to Scissorhands which also had an ironic Christmas setting. Notably the most obvious parallel, other than the whole Christmas setting, is that Edward and Oswald 'The Penguin' have the same makeup job. Another thing the two have in common that Burton has been doing for awhile now is that he always feels the need to have outcasts in his stories, that he wants you to feel sad for, which for a sympathetic character like Edward you would, but with characters such as The Penguin who are just naturally sick, twisted, and villainous, you really don't. The story for this doesn't have one narrative form to stick to, therefore the story itself really doesn't seem to know which character is really the protagonist. It should be Batman, but even much more so than in the original one he's so hidden from the audience that it's hard to care for many of the things that happen to him. What fascinates me, is when they present an interesting idea for him to get involved in, it chooses to not have enough focus on that. What I mostly refer to is his relationship with Selina/Catwoman, having a character that has similar qualities to the hero can make for a very interesting love relationship, but as you see in the movie they really only give the Bruce/Selina aspect 2-3 small scenes to do it justice, and her Catwoman facet is hard to read, as she seemingly tries seducing Batman to get the better of him not to find a relationship in him, leaving another plot thread that could've had further development through that side of it, but in the end resorts to it just feeling very unfinished. Now Michelle Pfeiffer's performance overall is okay, it's just that I really couldn't take her seriously as a character, which is ironic considering that she's probably the only character with an emotional arc in it. I think the reason why is that despite Burton trying to go for a somewhat darker tone, he still put in lots of silly, campy, cartoon humor that somewhat makes some of the performances like Michelle's feels unbalanced, because they ask us to care about an emotional arc that she has that kind of gets suffocated in the paraphernalia of the character, and the same goes for Danny as the Penguin. Tim Burton has recently stated that he now feels that his Batman movies look like lighthearted romps these days, and I can definitely see why he said that. I'm not implying that there shouldn't be any humor in it, but don't put so much in it that it feels forced. For me, and I think many others, the best thing to come out of this movie was the Danny Elfman score, a composer that's consistently coming up with great musical ideas for whatever movie he works on. Another positive thing about the movie that I can say is that even though the character of Max Schreck is written uninteresting, Christopher Walken makes it interesting by just being there, playing himself almost. I would compliment the visuals as being inspired, but now that I've revisited the movie, I can say that it's stuff borrowed from Burton's movie before this Edward Scissorhands, and I'd also add that visuals don't have much of a meaning without a meaningful story. ****

    Usually doing a second film no matter what the genre is. Is a good thing. It takes it to another level. My experience with Batman Returns was still pretty good. But not as enjoyable than the first film that was made in (1989). Michael Keaton returns to the franchise. I definitely think he's the best Batman of all time. George Clooney sucked. And whoever else played him was awful. This was a terrific choice for an actor. All of the special effects can get a little goofy at times. It has some intense scenes though. In my opinion this film is for kids age: 12 and up. So I give this movie a thumbs up. The first film gets two thumbs up. It was amazing. This one wasn't amazing. But it did continue the story in a nice way. The style of the camera shots were good. The close ups were nice. And overall the film did have its moments. So it's not awful. If you're a true Batman fan see it.

    First of all, and I think you would agree, that the second movie off any film is not as good as the first one. With Batman returns this was the case. Not great, but still good. Keaton still makes a good batman. The bat suite was tampered with a little bit but it mostly looks the same. But yet again the story of how the villain became a villain was told. Not how batman was created. This time two villains had risen, the penguin and cat-woman. The penguin was a bit overdone for my liking, his huge nose, three fingers on each hand, funny shaped body and hi even living with penguins! Gosh I wonder what they were trying to say? Is he maybe half penguin? Still Danny deVito played it well. Catwoman is a bit far-fetched. She was really made from the likes of cats.not better than batman, but surely worth having a look

    People are going to think I'm crazy, but I actually like this film is better than the previous, even better than most of Christopher Nolan's franchise. This is probably where the Batman series got to its darkest. I'm not just saying that due to the Gothic setting and down-beat atmosphere, but also because of the tension that builds between each of the main characters. The Bat, the Cat, and the Penguin are trying to identify themselves among everyone else in their lives. The film portrays this intensity by showing they are more connected than they realize. To me, the film, in its own right, is a masterpiece. There is fantastic acting, beautiful imagery, interesting plots and even an incredible soundtrack by Danny Elfman. This was, unfortunately, the last Batman film with Tim Burton as director. Fans then had to see the horrors of... well... just read my review for Batman Forever.

    Ah, heres a movie I remember fondly from my childhood. Man I had it all, the toys, the McDonald's happy meal toys (not to mention those cool large plastic McDonald's cups my mom bought me) the sega video game, the trading cards, the t shirts, the batmobile candy dispensers, all kinds of neat merch based on the movie. of course in retrospect, this is not at all a kids movie, despite the fact its batman and was aimed at kids who bought happy meals. but that doesn't mean its not a great movie. not every superhero movie has to cater strictly to the kids. nevertheless, my 6 year old self was too in love with batman to care about how dark it was, I still loved anything and everything having to do with my favorite superhero and I must have watched this movie, along with the other 2 movies (1989 batman and batman forever) a zillion times on video. here's the premise. Batman truly does Return in this sequel to the 1989 mega hit, and this time hes better then ever. hes got some new toys (like the electronic self-targeting Baterang), vehicles and even has 2 new classic villains to contend with. penguin is a classic Tim Burton character in this one, but that can only be a good thing. in this movie, Burton makes the characters very ambiguous. is the penguin really half animal, half human? is cat woman part cat, part woman? these questions never really get answered. personally, i don't believe they are part animal at all. the penguin is all human albeit a VERY deformed and ugly one, and is only called Penguin because of his deformities. Catwoman is always human but the whole "9 lives" thing makes it ambiguous whether she has supernatural powers or whether shes just very lucky. its debatable. Batman is the only normal guy in this. in fact, Keaton being the calm cool hero both as Bruce Wayne and batman, grounds the movie and keeps it together whereas the 2 villains are completely crazy and psychotic nut cases. it seemed Keaton didn't have it all together in the last movie, he had a a lot of demons to fight with, but by the end you got the feeling he found his purpose in life, now that hes got a bat-signal and the law on his side. so naturally, in this one he seems more together and knows what hes doing. its the villains who are not together and have all these obvious mental problems, so much so that they actually make batman look normal. if it was anyone else playing batman, it wouldn't have worked. but Michael Keaton has a unique screen presence that when he puts on the bat suit, he literally IS batman and lets face it, no one before or since has had the manly swagger that Michael Keaton had as batman. he was a bit older, getting some greys, was this sort of gruff everyman but has this seriousness and "normal guy" look that makes you take him seriously as batman. other actors who have played batman seem too pretty boy or hand picked and thus don't feel real. Keaton is like the everyman normal looking 40 year old gruff guy and he demands you take him seriously. this is a very artsy film, compared to its blockbuster brother from 1989, which was basically a cut-&-dry blockbuster action/adventure. but it really didn't have any emotion or depth to it, despite Keaton's sincere efforts. Thats where Returns comes in. all the characters are very interesting and in a way, they all echo Batman. Catwoman is the dark vigilante side of him, while the Penguin shows what Bruce Wayne could have been if he turned bitter against the world. I've heard many ppl say that this batman film is not really about Batman himself, and that too much attention is given to the villains, but i will say again, its not a bad thing, and doesn't ruin this film. batman himself is really not a very interesting character when you think about it. hes essentially a guy who's see's his parents get killed as a kid, he trains for X years, then decides to becomes batman for revenge purposes. OK. thats it. there's no more to it really. certainly not something i want to watch for a whole 2 hours. i really didn't see a point in making a whole movie about his origin a couple years ago, i think it was a waste. i was always kinda hoping they would bring back the Burton style of filmaking for batman movies, or maybe even get Burton back to direct. but alas, we got something that felt like a lesser version of the 1989 film. sad. but hey, we always have the Tim Burton films to enjoy. those, IMO, captured the real batman, beyond the facade of "comic book" movie looks (which, in Burton's case, is actually a good thing). as far as i'm concerned, Burton is the only guy to have directed Batman movies. hes the only one who i believed truly understood batman, as you can see in his various films. the other directors never really...got it. they just don't get batman. they only got him as a character, thats it. but Burton KNEW batman, he understood his plight in life, and the darkness inherent in the material. thats why this is to me, the best, and most personal, Batman film. it shows batman, and his villains, at there most raw. they are all hurt individuals, and thats what makes this film so powerful. this is what a batman film should be. serious, witty, playful, phycological, and DARK. while still retaining the comic book style that we all expect. this film also paved the way for the wonderful Batman: The Animated Series, which also shares Tim Burton's dark, Gothic look and feel from both of his Batman films. it even uses the same theme!

    My friends will know I have a mixed opinion of Nolans batman films. Begins was dull, TDK was pretty cool and TDKR....well, we have batman and robin to contend with worst batman movie. I say this as my friends say "the old films are to light hearted" I reply "Go watch batman returns" This film takes influences both from Batman and Burton's film he made just before this, Edward Scissorhands. The latter was Burton's personal favourite film, and for this film, he wanted to bring something new to the table. Batman returns has the Gothic, almost fairy tale like feel of Scissorhands-a dark, twisted fairy tale anyway. This is due to impressive production design, and Danny Elfmans score, which has the choir elements added in for that Burton feel. Keaton returns and once again impresses as batman. He isn't in that much (more than in TDKR though) but he brings a real pressence on screen. He is in my eyes the true Batman. Danny DeVito is the warped penguin and he is a very interesting, if vile, character. A great costume and make up team make him a great villain. Although he is not the crime boss from the comics, the abandoned mutant makes him a more sympathetic villain- only Aaron Eckhart is more sympathetic than penguin in the batman films. Michelle Pfeiffer is the scene stealer here as catwomen. Her demented take on the anti hero is very engaging and she has one of the coolest costumes ever. Finally Christopher Walken appears as corrupt tycoon Max Schrek. He is basically playing himself-which is awesome, as he is Christopher Walken. So we have a strong cast-what about the story? While it's morbid and dark, it's very interesting. Its complex and not realistic but is very powerful-but not uplifting. As for the production, Gotham looks as dark as it will ever look-its mostly set at night. Its a memroble setting, but not comic book-y-more Tim Burton-y. The music gets the tone of the film across very well-Danny Elfman has composed a real gem here. The action however is a bit lackluster-the music holds it together, making it seem more exciting. The biggest problem the film has is that its not a comic book movie-it does change the villains backstories, batman is slightly to immoral and the story doesn't have the simple plots or action to make it a comic book movie. Although its not the best representation of batman or comic book movies, and a disappointment compared to its predecessor, its a great watch if your into the dark worlds of Tim Burton-defiantly the dark knights darkest hour.

    I'll go ahead and say it, Batman Returns is my favorite Batman movie. As much as I love Nolan's Batman films such like 2008's Dark Knight for making more sense and realistic. I like how fun Batman Returns is. Yes, it's campy, creepy, and the plot makes little to no sense, still it's a lot of fun for me. Don't get me wrong, Nolan's films are superior movies over Tim Burton's mediocre films, but there is something about Batman Returns that get me watching all the time when it's on, TV. I think it's because it's feels like a creepy comic book movie. For me, this isn't supposed to be remotely realistic, this is a straight up fantasy. It has that old school horror movie feel to it. I love the Danny Elfman score, the cinematography, the set design, the ghoulish and semi-camp German Expressionism tone. I can see why it was too frightening for children to the point that parents got rid of the Batman Returns Happy Meals and didn't allow the kids to watch it. There were serious WTF moments in the film that pretty damn dark like Penguin (Danny Devito) eating a man's nose, a baby being abandon, sexually depraved dialogues between the Penguin and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and countless deaths. But seriously did any of these children ever see The Dark Knight? I have to say that, pretty scary and violence as well. Honestly, it's the parent's choice to allow their kids to watch it or not. Thank God, my parents allow me to see it because it's the film that made me a fan of Batman. This movie is messy, nonsensical and heavily flawed and I still love it. The movie starts out Penguin being abandoned by his parents because of his physical deformities when a child, he then tries to rejoin humanity with the help of a businessmen Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who then uses him as a part of his plot to allow his business to continue to operate free from government oversight by asking him to become mayor after the city start to sympathize him for what his parents did to him. What the film does wrong, is make him a villain outright without much character development. Rather than getting abused and tossed aside just at the moment when he almost begins to believe that perhaps he is capable of being respected and that people may not be so bad, the film makes him deranged, terrorist and the monstrous psychopath bear little resemblance to the savvy, anti-heroic thief or the neutral informant businessman of the comics. If only they had the betrayal by the city folks drives him insane and he tries to destroy the society that spurned and abused him would make an excellent movie rather than Penguin looking like a monster dimwit with his multiplies fails plots like getting revenge on Gotham socialites by abducting and killing their infant or blowing the city with penguin carrying missiles. As much as I like Christopher Walken and his President Andrew Jackson's hairdo, the story could have done without his character. I know Shreck is the bad-guy of the film that needed to put Selena on her quest for revenge and track towards insanity. You can easier fit Penguin in that role. The best part of the film is the conflict & romance of Selena and Bruce that should had been the main focal point of the film. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) and Selina Kyle. Pfeiffer and Keaton both give great performances, and their on-screen chemistry is excellent. If the main focus had been on developing their relationship it would have been a great movie. As it is, just a handful of short scenes together simply didn't cut it. The sequence with Bruce and Selena at the party was the best scene in the film. The conflict and chemistry between the two draws you in, especially when watching Selena's own problems with mounting insanity. Still, don't know how she became a master of kung-fu. I love Michelle's catwoman more than Anna Hatchaway in 2012's Dark Knight's Rises. As much as I love Michelle, Anne Hathaway comes the closest to portraying Catwoman from the comics as far as the movies goes. Still, Michael Keaton was the best Batman. The mischaracterizations of Batman from the first film are carried over and amplified here. Batman is murderous, and remorseless. True, Batman originally carried a gun and killed, but that aspect of the character didn't survive the first year of an 80+ year run, and is not really a valid interpretation of the character anymore. Batman doesn't murder people. Thank God, Marlon Wayans wasn't portraying Robin and Robin was cut out. The inconsistent tone of the film also works against it. Burton presents a very bleak, grim, nihilistic serious story, where the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are monsters. He them loads the film with absurdist camp set pieces, but plays them straight and seems to expect the audience to take them seriously. This causes the tone to shift wildly, and the audience ends up laughing at things meant to be taken seriously and taking jokes at face value. Artistic license is one thing, but these characters got the worst of the Burton treatment, and both characters suffer for it in a major way. Overall: I agree Batman Returns had flaws. Batman Return has a somber tone punctuated with ridiculousness, but it's watchable. I can't say the same with its follow ups: 1995's Batman Forever and 1997's Batman & Robin. Those movies nearly ruin batman until Nolan step in with 2005's Batman Begins. Still, glad Tim Burton didn't made another Batman after this.

    Batman Returns was a major disappointment to me. When I saw the first Batman in this series, I loved it (mostly due to Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker). The thing about these original Batman movies is that they put the majority of the focus on the villains. The Joker was a complete show maker in the last one, but this one includes Danny DeVito as the Penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman. While both actors did a good job, the two different stories of the Penguin and Cat Woman did not make a good combination. The Penguins story was depressing which added gloom to the story, and Cat Woman's story was disturbing which added darkness to the story. Put them together and you have a movie that's disturbingly depressing (or Depressingly Disturbing which ever you prefer.) Batman himself was played for the last time by Michael Keaton. A lot of people were mad when Keaton didn't return in the last two films for this series but personally I was OK with it. It's not that I think that he's a bad actor, as much as I think that he wasn't a convincing Batman (he doesn't look the part for starters). The rest of the acting was good. Particularly Christopher Walken as Max. He did a great job. I just don't think that a movie that doubles up on negative emotions is a good way to get buyers. And so thus, after one successful movie, the Batman franchise began to fail.

    This is one of those movies that's going to affect your opinion of it in weird ways, the more you think of it.

Another thing the two have in common that Burton has been doing for awhile now is that he always feels the need to have outcasts in his stories, that he wants you to feel sad for, which for a sympathetic character like Edward you would, but with characters such as The Penguin who are just naturally sick, twisted, and villainous, you really don't. The story for this doesn't have one narrative form to stick to, therefore the story itself really doesn't seem to know which character is really the protagonist. It should be Batman, but even much more so than in the original one he's so hidden from the audience that it's hard to care for many of the things that happen to him. What fascinates me, is when they present an interesting idea for him to get involved in, it chooses to not have enough focus on that. What I mostly refer to is his relationship with Selina/Catwoman, having a character that has similar qualities to the hero can make for a very interesting love relationship, but as you see in the movie they really only give the Bruce/Selina aspect 2-3 small scenes to do it justice, and her Catwoman facet is hard to read, as she seemingly tries seducing Batman to get the better of him not to find a relationship in him, leaving another plot thread that could've had further development through that side of it, but in the end resorts to it just feeling very unfinished. Now Michelle Pfeiffer's performance overall is okay, it's just that I really couldn't take her seriously as a character, which is ironic considering that she's probably the only character with an emotional arc in it. I think the reason why is that despite Burton trying to go for a somewhat darker tone, he still put in lots of silly, campy, cartoon humor that somewhat makes some of the performances like Michelle's feels unbalanced, because they ask us to care about an emotional arc that she has that kind of gets suffocated in the paraphernalia of the character, and the same goes for Danny as the Penguin. Tim Burton has recently stated that he now feels that his Batman movies look like lighthearted romps these days, and I can definitely see why he said that. I'm not implying that there shouldn't be any humor in it, but don't put so much in it that it feels forced. For me, and I think many others, the best thing to come out of this movie was the Danny Elfman score, a composer that's consistently coming up with great musical ideas for whatever movie he works on. Another positive thing about the movie that I can say is that even though the character of Max Schreck is written uninteresting, Christopher Walken makes it interesting by just being there, playing himself almost. I would compliment the visuals as being inspired, but now that I've revisited the movie, I can say that it's stuff borrowed from Burton's movie before this Edward Scissorhands, and I'd also add that visuals don't have much of a meaning without a meaningful story. ****

    Usually doing a second film no matter what the genre is. Is a good thing. It takes it to another level. My experience with Batman Returns was still pretty good. But not as enjoyable than the first film that was made in (1989). Michael Keaton returns to the franchise. I definitely think he's the best Batman of all time. George Clooney sucked. And whoever else played him was awful. This was a terrific choice for an actor. All of the special effects can get a little goofy at times. It has some intense scenes though. In my opinion this film is for kids age: 12 and up. So I give this movie a thumbs up. The first film gets two thumbs up. It was amazing. This one wasn't amazing. But it did continue the story in a nice way. The style of the camera shots were good. The close ups were nice. And overall the film did have its moments. So it's not awful. If you're a true Batman fan see it.

    First of all, and I think you would agree, that the second movie off any film is not as good as the first one. With Batman returns this was the case. Not great, but still good. Keaton still makes a good batman. The bat suite was tampered with a little bit but it mostly looks the same. But yet again the story of how the villain became a villain was told. Not how batman was created. This time two villains had risen, the penguin and cat-woman. The penguin was a bit overdone for my liking, his huge nose, three fingers on each hand, funny shaped body and hi even living with penguins! Gosh I wonder what they were trying to say? Is he maybe half penguin? Still Danny deVito played it well. Catwoman is a bit far-fetched. She was really made from the likes of cats.not better than batman, but surely worth having a look

    People are going to think I'm crazy, but I actually like this film is better than the previous, even better than most of Christopher Nolan's franchise. This is probably where the Batman series got to its darkest. I'm not just saying that due to the Gothic setting and down-beat atmosphere, but also because of the tension that builds between each of the main characters. The Bat, the Cat, and the Penguin are trying to identify themselves among everyone else in their lives. The film portrays this intensity by showing they are more connected than they realize. To me, the film, in its own right, is a masterpiece. There is fantastic acting, beautiful imagery, interesting plots and even an incredible soundtrack by Danny Elfman. This was, unfortunately, the last Batman film with Tim Burton as director. Fans then had to see the horrors of... well... just read my review for Batman Forever.

    Ah, heres a movie I remember fondly from my childhood. Man I had it all, the toys, the McDonald's happy meal toys (not to mention those cool large plastic McDonald's cups my mom bought me) the sega video game, the trading cards, the t shirts, the batmobile candy dispensers, all kinds of neat merch based on the movie. of course in retrospect, this is not at all a kids movie, despite the fact its batman and was aimed at kids who bought happy meals. but that doesn't mean its not a great movie. not every superhero movie has to cater strictly to the kids. nevertheless, my 6 year old self was too in love with batman to care about how dark it was, I still loved anything and everything having to do with my favorite superhero and I must have watched this movie, along with the other 2 movies (1989 batman and batman forever) a zillion times on video. here's the premise. Batman truly does Return in this sequel to the 1989 mega hit, and this time hes better then ever. hes got some new toys (like the electronic self-targeting Baterang), vehicles and even has 2 new classic villains to contend with. penguin is a classic Tim Burton character in this one, but that can only be a good thing. in this movie, Burton makes the characters very ambiguous. is the penguin really half animal, half human? is cat woman part cat, part woman? these questions never really get answered. personally, i don't believe they are part animal at all. the penguin is all human albeit a VERY deformed and ugly one, and is only called Penguin because of his deformities. Catwoman is always human but the whole "9 lives" thing makes it ambiguous whether she has supernatural powers or whether shes just very lucky. its debatable. Batman is the only normal guy in this. in fact, Keaton being the calm cool hero both as Bruce Wayne and batman, grounds the movie and keeps it together whereas the 2 villains are completely crazy and psychotic nut cases. it seemed Keaton didn't have it all together in the last movie, he had a a lot of demons to fight with, but by the end you got the feeling he found his purpose in life, now that hes got a bat-signal and the law on his side. so naturally, in this one he seems more together and knows what hes doing. its the villains who are not together and have all these obvious mental problems, so much so that they actually make batman look normal. if it was anyone else playing batman, it wouldn't have worked. but Michael Keaton has a unique screen presence that when he puts on the bat suit, he literally IS batman and lets face it, no one before or since has had the manly swagger that Michael Keaton had as batman. he was a bit older, getting some greys, was this sort of gruff everyman but has this seriousness and "normal guy" look that makes you take him seriously as batman. other actors who have played batman seem too pretty boy or hand picked and thus don't feel real. Keaton is like the everyman normal looking 40 year old gruff guy and he demands you take him seriously. this is a very artsy film, compared to its blockbuster brother from 1989, which was basically a cut-&-dry blockbuster action/adventure. but it really didn't have any emotion or depth to it, despite Keaton's sincere efforts. Thats where Returns comes in. all the characters are very interesting and in a way, they all echo Batman. Catwoman is the dark vigilante side of him, while the Penguin shows what Bruce Wayne could have been if he turned bitter against the world. I've heard many ppl say that this batman film is not really about Batman himself, and that too much attention is given to the villains, but i will say again, its not a bad thing, and doesn't ruin this film. batman himself is really not a very interesting character when you think about it. hes essentially a guy who's see's his parents get killed as a kid, he trains for X years, then decides to becomes batman for revenge purposes. OK. thats it. there's no more to it really. certainly not something i want to watch for a whole 2 hours. i really didn't see a point in making a whole movie about his origin a couple years ago, i think it was a waste. i was always kinda hoping they would bring back the Burton style of filmaking for batman movies, or maybe even get Burton back to direct. but alas, we got something that felt like a lesser version of the 1989 film. sad. but hey, we always have the Tim Burton films to enjoy. those, IMO, captured the real batman, beyond the facade of "comic book" movie looks (which, in Burton's case, is actually a good thing). as far as i'm concerned, Burton is the only guy to have directed Batman movies. hes the only one who i believed truly understood batman, as you can see in his various films. the other directors never really...got it. they just don't get batman. they only got him as a character, thats it. but Burton KNEW batman, he understood his plight in life, and the darkness inherent in the material. thats why this is to me, the best, and most personal, Batman film. it shows batman, and his villains, at there most raw. they are all hurt individuals, and thats what makes this film so powerful. this is what a batman film should be. serious, witty, playful, phycological, and DARK. while still retaining the comic book style that we all expect. this film also paved the way for the wonderful Batman: The Animated Series, which also shares Tim Burton's dark, Gothic look and feel from both of his Batman films. it even uses the same theme!

    My friends will know I have a mixed opinion of Nolans batman films. Begins was dull, TDK was pretty cool and TDKR....well, we have batman and robin to contend with worst batman movie. I say this as my friends say "the old films are to light hearted" I reply "Go watch batman returns" This film takes influences both from Batman and Burton's film he made just before this, Edward Scissorhands. The latter was Burton's personal favourite film, and for this film, he wanted to bring something new to the table. Batman returns has the Gothic, almost fairy tale like feel of Scissorhands-a dark, twisted fairy tale anyway. This is due to impressive production design, and Danny Elfmans score, which has the choir elements added in for that Burton feel. Keaton returns and once again impresses as batman. He isn't in that much (more than in TDKR though) but he brings a real pressence on screen. He is in my eyes the true Batman. Danny DeVito is the warped penguin and he is a very interesting, if vile, character. A great costume and make up team make him a great villain. Although he is not the crime boss from the comics, the abandoned mutant makes him a more sympathetic villain- only Aaron Eckhart is more sympathetic than penguin in the batman films. Michelle Pfeiffer is the scene stealer here as catwomen. Her demented take on the anti hero is very engaging and she has one of the coolest costumes ever. Finally Christopher Walken appears as corrupt tycoon Max Schrek. He is basically playing himself-which is awesome, as he is Christopher Walken. So we have a strong cast-what about the story? While it's morbid and dark, it's very interesting. Its complex and not realistic but is very powerful-but not uplifting. As for the production, Gotham looks as dark as it will ever look-its mostly set at night. Its a memroble setting, but not comic book-y-more Tim Burton-y. The music gets the tone of the film across very well-Danny Elfman has composed a real gem here. The action however is a bit lackluster-the music holds it together, making it seem more exciting. The biggest problem the film has is that its not a comic book movie-it does change the villains backstories, batman is slightly to immoral and the story doesn't have the simple plots or action to make it a comic book movie. Although its not the best representation of batman or comic book movies, and a disappointment compared to its predecessor, its a great watch if your into the dark worlds of Tim Burton-defiantly the dark knights darkest hour.

    I'll go ahead and say it, Batman Returns is my favorite Batman movie. As much as I love Nolan's Batman films such like 2008's Dark Knight for making more sense and realistic. I like how fun Batman Returns is. Yes, it's campy, creepy, and the plot makes little to no sense, still it's a lot of fun for me. Don't get me wrong, Nolan's films are superior movies over Tim Burton's mediocre films, but there is something about Batman Returns that get me watching all the time when it's on, TV. I think it's because it's feels like a creepy comic book movie. For me, this isn't supposed to be remotely realistic, this is a straight up fantasy. It has that old school horror movie feel to it. I love the Danny Elfman score, the cinematography, the set design, the ghoulish and semi-camp German Expressionism tone. I can see why it was too frightening for children to the point that parents got rid of the Batman Returns Happy Meals and didn't allow the kids to watch it. There were serious WTF moments in the film that pretty damn dark like Penguin (Danny Devito) eating a man's nose, a baby being abandon, sexually depraved dialogues between the Penguin and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and countless deaths. But seriously did any of these children ever see The Dark Knight? I have to say that, pretty scary and violence as well. Honestly, it's the parent's choice to allow their kids to watch it or not. Thank God, my parents allow me to see it because it's the film that made me a fan of Batman. This movie is messy, nonsensical and heavily flawed and I still love it. The movie starts out Penguin being abandoned by his parents because of his physical deformities when a child, he then tries to rejoin humanity with the help of a businessmen Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who then uses him as a part of his plot to allow his business to continue to operate free from government oversight by asking him to become mayor after the city start to sympathize him for what his parents did to him. What the film does wrong, is make him a villain outright without much character development. Rather than getting abused and tossed aside just at the moment when he almost begins to believe that perhaps he is capable of being respected and that people may not be so bad, the film makes him deranged, terrorist and the monstrous psychopath bear little resemblance to the savvy, anti-heroic thief or the neutral informant businessman of the comics. If only they had the betrayal by the city folks drives him insane and he tries to destroy the society that spurned and abused him would make an excellent movie rather than Penguin looking like a monster dimwit with his multiplies fails plots like getting revenge on Gotham socialites by abducting and killing their infant or blowing the city with penguin carrying missiles. As much as I like Christopher Walken and his President Andrew Jackson's hairdo, the story could have done without his character. I know Shreck is the bad-guy of the film that needed to put Selena on her quest for revenge and track towards insanity. You can easier fit Penguin in that role. The best part of the film is the conflict & romance of Selena and Bruce that should had been the main focal point of the film. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) and Selina Kyle. Pfeiffer and Keaton both give great performances, and their on-screen chemistry is excellent. If the main focus had been on developing their relationship it would have been a great movie. As it is, just a handful of short scenes together simply didn't cut it. The sequence with Bruce and Selena at the party was the best scene in the film. The conflict and chemistry between the two draws you in, especially when watching Selena's own problems with mounting insanity. Still, don't know how she became a master of kung-fu. I love Michelle's catwoman more than Anna Hatchaway in 2012's Dark Knight's Rises. As much as I love Michelle, Anne Hathaway comes the closest to portraying Catwoman from the comics as far as the movies goes. Still, Michael Keaton was the best Batman. The mischaracterizations of Batman from the first film are carried over and amplified here. Batman is murderous, and remorseless. True, Batman originally carried a gun and killed, but that aspect of the character didn't survive the first year of an 80+ year run, and is not really a valid interpretation of the character anymore. Batman doesn't murder people. Thank God, Marlon Wayans wasn't portraying Robin and Robin was cut out. The inconsistent tone of the film also works against it. Burton presents a very bleak, grim, nihilistic serious story, where the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are monsters. He them loads the film with absurdist camp set pieces, but plays them straight and seems to expect the audience to take them seriously. This causes the tone to shift wildly, and the audience ends up laughing at things meant to be taken seriously and taking jokes at face value. Artistic license is one thing, but these characters got the worst of the Burton treatment, and both characters suffer for it in a major way. Overall: I agree Batman Returns had flaws. Batman Return has a somber tone punctuated with ridiculousness, but it's watchable. I can't say the same with its follow ups: 1995's Batman Forever and 1997's Batman & Robin. Those movies nearly ruin batman until Nolan step in with 2005's Batman Begins. Still, glad Tim Burton didn't made another Batman after this.

    Batman Returns was a major disappointment to me. When I saw the first Batman in this series, I loved it (mostly due to Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker). The thing about these original Batman movies is that they put the majority of the focus on the villains. The Joker was a complete show maker in the last one, but this one includes Danny DeVito as the Penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman. While both actors did a good job, the two different stories of the Penguin and Cat Woman did not make a good combination. The Penguins story was depressing which added gloom to the story, and Cat Woman's story was disturbing which added darkness to the story. Put them together and you have a movie that's disturbingly depressing (or Depressingly Disturbing which ever you prefer.) Batman himself was played for the last time by Michael Keaton. A lot of people were mad when Keaton didn't return in the last two films for this series but personally I was OK with it. It's not that I think that he's a bad actor, as much as I think that he wasn't a convincing Batman (he doesn't look the part for starters). The rest of the acting was good. Particularly Christopher Walken as Max. He did a great job. I just don't think that a movie that doubles up on negative emotions is a good way to get buyers. And so thus, after one successful movie, the Batman franchise began to fail.

    Hello readers, I am back with another review, this time about one of the most controversial super-hero movies of all time, BATMAN RETURNS. The film opens with a young penguin being thrown into the sewer by his hateful parents. This calls for Danny Elfman's new musical score to come in. Already I can see how dark this film is going to be than the previous. The reason of this is that Tim Burton had the freedom to make a Batman film the way he liked it which makes for a bizarre and Gothic entry... due to the great success of the first installment that is. So the film then proceeds with an awesome action scene where Batman returns. Then we get a scene with Max Shrek confronting the Penguin played by Danny DeVito who is so freaky and compelling in this film. I always wondered, who the hell taught The Penguin how to talk? The scene is quite scary and now we are finally assured that we are in for one hell of "BURTON" type film. Why didn't he just make another film with this kind of style, why do it to poor Batman? Anyway Max Shrek throws Selina Kyle out of a window and when she lays on the ground a pack of cats start well ravaging her until she comes too in a frightening scene. We then get a scene of Selina loosing her mind thus becoming the film's second villain, Catwoman. The rest of the film drags with fake action scenes and bizarre confrontations. They film becomes very un-enjoyable during the half way point and just becomes ultimately weird. I mean look at all these scenes, there's the bit when Penguin bites this guys nose, Penguin eats a raw fish, Catwoman and Batman get all frisky and it just seems to be more of a BEETLE JUICE film than a Batman film. I mean seriously Tim, why not just make your own bloody movie! Why just completely weird-out the Batman series and thus create Batman Forever! Along with the just as bad Batman And Robin. After a mind bendingly stupid plan by The Penguin we reach the final battle which features a pretty cool scene with Michael Keaton turning around to see the helpless Penguin as sparks pop behind him. So the film finishes with a mystery which leaves me hoping for another Burton film which was never made due to parents, believe it or not! That's your fault for making it all dark and weird Tim! And, yeah the film is OK and with no doubt isn't as bad as most claim but here ends my review for Batman Returns, the wonderfully different entry to the Batman legacy. See you soon for further reviews or you can check out my previous ones...

    Equally magnificent sequel has Michael Keaton returning as Bruce Wayne/Batman, only here is opposed by the double threat of Catwoman(marvelously played by the sultry Michele Pfeiffer) who starts off as harried secretary Selina Kyle, who is transformed into Catwoman after a betrayal. They develop a close relationship, since they both have a great deal in common... Danny DeVito portrays Oswald Cobblepot/the Penquin, who was a deformed child brought up in the sewers of Gotham, and now heads a criminal gang. DeVito effectively plays the pathos of this man, who can't decide if he wants to re-enter society or not, but a dramatic turn-of-events pushes him over the edge... Filled with fantastic action, set design, and music score, this production is another triumph, one of the few sequels to match the original, even though some feel it is too dark, the subject matter suits this. A great pity that star Michael Keaton and director Tim Burton stopped here, and didn't get the chance to do a trilogy, since the new team drove this series off the rails...A shame that.

    This is one of those movies that's going to affect your opinion of it in weird ways, the more you think of it. For some this is a movie that got better with time, and for many others it only had gotten worse. Unfortunately the latter has happened for me, and to be honest there was a time when I gave it at least a 7, because I thought as a Tim Burton movie, and not a Batman movie, it succeeded, but then I re-visited it to only find that it's more a carbon copy of one of his past works. That movie is possibly his most critically acclaimed movie Edward Scissorhands, which is actually good on its own merits, but it's not necessarily a movie that can be redone to great success. Why I say this about Returns is that right from the get go we as viewers don't feel like we're in Gotham anymore, but really just this small claustrophobic set, that doesn't feel quite as large as the Gotham seen in the first movie, but more let the sets to Scissorhands which also had an ironic Christmas setting. Notably the most obvious parallel, other than the whole Christmas setting, is that Edward and Oswald 'The Penguin' have the same makeup job. Another thing the two have in common that Burton has been doing for awhile now is that he always feels the need to have outcasts in his stories, that he wants you to feel sad for, which for a sympathetic character like Edward you would, but with characters such as The Penguin who are just naturally sick, twisted, and villainous, you really don't. The story for this doesn't have one narrative form to stick to, therefore the story itself really doesn't seem to know which character is really the protagonist. It should be Batman, but even much more so than in the original one he's so hidden from the audience that it's hard to care for many of the things that happen to him. What fascinates me, is when they present an interesting idea for him to get involved in, it chooses to not have enough focus on that. What I mostly refer to is his relationship with Selina/Catwoman, having a character that has similar qualities to the hero can make for a very interesting love relationship, but as you see in the movie they really only give the Bruce/Selina aspect 2-3 small scenes to do it justice, and her Catwoman facet is hard to read, as she seemingly tries seducing Batman to get the better of him not to find a relationship in him, leaving another plot thread that could've had further development through that side of it, but in the end resorts to it just feeling very unfinished. Now Michelle Pfeiffer's performance overall is okay, it's just that I really couldn't take her seriously as a character, which is ironic considering that she's probably the only character with an emotional arc in it. I think the reason why is that despite Burton trying to go for a somewhat darker tone, he still put in lots of silly, campy, cartoon humor that somewhat makes some of the performances like Michelle's feels unbalanced, because they ask us to care about an emotional arc that she has that kind of gets suffocated in the paraphernalia of the character, and the same goes for Danny as the Penguin.

    First of all, and I think you would agree, that the second movie off any film is not as good as the first one. With Batman returns this was the case. Not great, but still good. Keaton still makes a good batman. The bat suite was tampered with a little bit but it mostly looks the same. But yet again the story of how the villain became a villain was told. Not how batman was created. This time two villains had risen, the penguin and cat-woman. The penguin was a bit overdone for my liking, his huge nose, three fingers on each hand, funny shaped body and hi even living with penguins! Gosh I wonder what they were trying to say? Is he maybe half penguin? Still Danny deVito played it well. Catwoman is a bit far-fetched. She was really made from the likes of cats.not better than batman, but surely worth having a look

    People are going to think I'm crazy, but I actually like this film is better than the previous, even better than most of Christopher Nolan's franchise. This is probably where the Batman series got to its darkest. I'm not just saying that due to the Gothic setting and down-beat atmosphere, but also because of the tension that builds between each of the main characters. The Bat, the Cat, and the Penguin are trying to identify themselves among everyone else in their lives. The film portrays this intensity by showing they are more connected than they realize. To me, the film, in its own right, is a masterpiece. There is fantastic acting, beautiful imagery, interesting plots and even an incredible soundtrack by Danny Elfman. This was, unfortunately, the last Batman film with Tim Burton as director. Fans then had to see the horrors of... well... just read my review for Batman Forever.

    Ah, heres a movie I remember fondly from my childhood. Man I had it all, the toys, the McDonald's happy meal toys (not to mention those cool large plastic McDonald's cups my mom bought me) the sega video game, the trading cards, the t shirts, the batmobile candy dispensers, all kinds of neat merch based on the movie. of course in retrospect, this is not at all a kids movie, despite the fact its batman and was aimed at kids who bought happy meals. but that doesn't mean its not a great movie. not every superhero movie has to cater strictly to the kids. nevertheless, my 6 year old self was too in love with batman to care about how dark it was, I still loved anything and everything having to do with my favorite superhero and I must have watched this movie, along with the other 2 movies (1989 batman and batman forever) a zillion times on video. here's the premise. Batman truly does Return in this sequel to the 1989 mega hit, and this time hes better then ever. hes got some new toys (like the electronic self-targeting Baterang), vehicles and even has 2 new classic villains to contend with. penguin is a classic Tim Burton character in this one, but that can only be a good thing. in this movie, Burton makes the characters very ambiguous. is the penguin really half animal, half human? is cat woman part cat, part woman? these questions never really get answered. personally, i don't believe they are part animal at all. the penguin is all human albeit a VERY deformed and ugly one, and is only called Penguin because of his deformities. Catwoman is always human but the whole "9 lives" thing makes it ambiguous whether she has supernatural powers or whether shes just very lucky. its debatable. Batman is the only normal guy in this. in fact, Keaton being the calm cool hero both as Bruce Wayne and batman, grounds the movie and keeps it together whereas the 2 villains are completely crazy and psychotic nut cases. it seemed Keaton didn't have it all together in the last movie, he had a a lot of demons to fight with, but by the end you got the feeling he found his purpose in life, now that hes got a bat-signal and the law on his side. so naturally, in this one he seems more together and knows what hes doing. its the villains who are not together and have all these obvious mental problems, so much so that they actually make batman look normal. if it was anyone else playing batman, it wouldn't have worked. but Michael Keaton has a unique screen presence that when he puts on the bat suit, he literally IS batman and lets face it, no one before or since has had the manly swagger that Michael Keaton had as batman. he was a bit older, getting some greys, was this sort of gruff everyman but has this seriousness and "normal guy" look that makes you take him seriously as batman. other actors who have played batman seem too pretty boy or hand picked and thus don't feel real. Keaton is like the everyman normal looking 40 year old gruff guy and he demands you take him seriously. this is a very artsy film, compared to its blockbuster brother from 1989, which was basically a cut-&-dry blockbuster action/adventure. but it really didn't have any emotion or depth to it, despite Keaton's sincere efforts. Thats where Returns comes in. all the characters are very interesting and in a way, they all echo Batman. Catwoman is the dark vigilante side of him, while the Penguin shows what Bruce Wayne could have been if he turned bitter against the world. I've heard many ppl say that this batman film is not really about Batman himself, and that too much attention is given to the villains, but i will say again, its not a bad thing, and doesn't ruin this film. batman himself is really not a very interesting character when you think about it. hes essentially a guy who's see's his parents get killed as a kid, he trains for X years, then decides to becomes batman for revenge purposes. OK. thats it. there's no more to it really. certainly not something i want to watch for a whole 2 hours. i really didn't see a point in making a whole movie about his origin a couple years ago, i think it was a waste. i was always kinda hoping they would bring back the Burton style of filmaking for batman movies, or maybe even get Burton back to direct. but alas, we got something that felt like a lesser version of the 1989 film. sad. but hey, we always have the Tim Burton films to enjoy. those, IMO, captured the real batman, beyond the facade of "comic book" movie looks (which, in Burton's case, is actually a good thing). as far as i'm concerned, Burton is the only guy to have directed Batman movies. hes the only one who i believed truly understood batman, as you can see in his various films. the other directors never really...got it. they just don't get batman. they only got him as a character, thats it. but Burton KNEW batman, he understood his plight in life, and the darkness inherent in the material. thats why this is to me, the best, and most personal, Batman film. it shows batman, and his villains, at there most raw. they are all hurt individuals, and thats what makes this film so powerful. this is what a batman film should be. serious, witty, playful, phycological, and DARK. while still retaining the comic book style that we all expect. this film also paved the way for the wonderful Batman: The Animated Series, which also shares Tim Burton's dark, Gothic look and feel from both of his Batman films. it even uses the same theme!

    My friends will know I have a mixed opinion of Nolans batman films. Begins was dull, TDK was pretty cool and TDKR....well, we have batman and robin to contend with worst batman movie. I say this as my friends say "the old films are to light hearted" I reply "Go watch batman returns" This film takes influences both from Batman and Burton's film he made just before this, Edward Scissorhands. The latter was Burton's personal favourite film, and for this film, he wanted to bring something new to the table. Batman returns has the Gothic, almost fairy tale like feel of Scissorhands-a dark, twisted fairy tale anyway. This is due to impressive production design, and Danny Elfmans score, which has the choir elements added in for that Burton feel. Keaton returns and once again impresses as batman. He isn't in that much (more than in TDKR though) but he brings a real pressence on screen. He is in my eyes the true Batman. Danny DeVito is the warped penguin and he is a very interesting, if vile, character. A great costume and make up team make him a great villain. Although he is not the crime boss from the comics, the abandoned mutant makes him a more sympathetic villain- only Aaron Eckhart is more sympathetic than penguin in the batman films. Michelle Pfeiffer is the scene stealer here as catwomen. Her demented take on the anti hero is very engaging and she has one of the coolest costumes ever. Finally Christopher Walken appears as corrupt tycoon Max Schrek. He is basically playing himself-which is awesome, as he is Christopher Walken. So we have a strong cast-what about the story? While it's morbid and dark, it's very interesting. Its complex and not realistic but is very powerful-but not uplifting. As for the production, Gotham looks as dark as it will ever look-its mostly set at night. Its a memroble setting, but not comic book-y-more Tim Burton-y. The music gets the tone of the film across very well-Danny Elfman has composed a real gem here. The action however is a bit lackluster-the music holds it together, making it seem more exciting. The biggest problem the film has is that its not a comic book movie-it does change the villains backstories, batman is slightly to immoral and the story doesn't have the simple plots or action to make it a comic book movie. Although its not the best representation of batman or comic book movies, and a disappointment compared to its predecessor, its a great watch if your into the dark worlds of Tim Burton-defiantly the dark knights darkest hour.

    I'll go ahead and say it, Batman Returns is my favorite Batman movie. As much as I love Nolan's Batman films such like 2008's Dark Knight for making more sense and realistic. I like how fun Batman Returns is. Yes, it's campy, creepy, and the plot makes little to no sense, still it's a lot of fun for me. Don't get me wrong, Nolan's films are superior movies over Tim Burton's mediocre films, but there is something about Batman Returns that get me watching all the time when it's on, TV. I think it's because it's feels like a creepy comic book movie. For me, this isn't supposed to be remotely realistic, this is a straight up fantasy. It has that old school horror movie feel to it. I love the Danny Elfman score, the cinematography, the set design, the ghoulish and semi-camp German Expressionism tone. I can see why it was too frightening for children to the point that parents got rid of the Batman Returns Happy Meals and didn't allow the kids to watch it. There were serious WTF moments in the film that pretty damn dark like Penguin (Danny Devito) eating a man's nose, a baby being abandon, sexually depraved dialogues between the Penguin and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and countless deaths. But seriously did any of these children ever see The Dark Knight? I have to say that, pretty scary and violence as well. Honestly, it's the parent's choice to allow their kids to watch it or not. Thank God, my parents allow me to see it because it's the film that made me a fan of Batman. This movie is messy, nonsensical and heavily flawed and I still love it. The movie starts out Penguin being abandoned by his parents because of his physical deformities when a child, he then tries to rejoin humanity with the help of a businessmen Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who then uses him as a part of his plot to allow his business to continue to operate free from government oversight by asking him to become mayor after the city start to sympathize him for what his parents did to him. What the film does wrong, is make him a villain outright without much character development. Rather than getting abused and tossed aside just at the moment when he almost begins to believe that perhaps he is capable of being respected and that people may not be so bad, the film makes him deranged, terrorist and the monstrous psychopath bear little resemblance to the savvy, anti-heroic thief or the neutral informant businessman of the comics. If only they had the betrayal by the city folks drives him insane and he tries to destroy the society that spurned and abused him would make an excellent movie rather than Penguin looking like a monster dimwit with his multiplies fails plots like getting revenge on Gotham socialites by abducting and killing their infant or blowing the city with penguin carrying missiles. As much as I like Christopher Walken and his President Andrew Jackson's hairdo, the story could have done without his character. I know Shreck is the bad-guy of the film that needed to put Selena on her quest for revenge and track towards insanity. You can easier fit Penguin in that role. The best part of the film is the conflict & romance of Selena and Bruce that should had been the main focal point of the film. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) and Selina Kyle. Pfeiffer and Keaton both give great performances, and their on-screen chemistry is excellent. If the main focus had been on developing their relationship it would have been a great movie. As it is, just a handful of short scenes together simply didn't cut it. The sequence with Bruce and Selena at the party was the best scene in the film. The conflict and chemistry between the two draws you in, especially when watching Selena's own problems with mounting insanity. Still, don't know how she became a master of kung-fu. I love Michelle's catwoman more than Anna Hatchaway in 2012's Dark Knight's Rises. As much as I love Michelle, Anne Hathaway comes the closest to portraying Catwoman from the comics as far as the movies goes. Still, Michael Keaton was the best Batman. The mischaracterizations of Batman from the first film are carried over and amplified here. Batman is murderous, and remorseless. True, Batman originally carried a gun and killed, but that aspect of the character didn't survive the first year of an 80+ year run, and is not really a valid interpretation of the character anymore. Batman doesn't murder people. Thank God, Marlon Wayans wasn't portraying Robin and Robin was cut out. The inconsistent tone of the film also works against it. Burton presents a very bleak, grim, nihilistic serious story, where the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are monsters. He them loads the film with absurdist camp set pieces, but plays them straight and seems to expect the audience to take them seriously. This causes the tone to shift wildly, and the audience ends up laughing at things meant to be taken seriously and taking jokes at face value. Artistic license is one thing, but these characters got the worst of the Burton treatment, and both characters suffer for it in a major way. Overall: I agree Batman Returns had flaws. Batman Return has a somber tone punctuated with ridiculousness, but it's watchable. I can't say the same with its follow ups: 1995's Batman Forever and 1997's Batman & Robin. Those movies nearly ruin batman until Nolan step in with 2005's Batman Begins. Still, glad Tim Burton didn't made another Batman after this.

    Batman Returns was a major disappointment to me. When I saw the first Batman in this series, I loved it (mostly due to Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker). The thing about these original Batman movies is that they put the majority of the focus on the villains. The Joker was a complete show maker in the last one, but this one includes Danny DeVito as the Penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman. While both actors did a good job, the two different stories of the Penguin and Cat Woman did not make a good combination. The Penguins story was depressing which added gloom to the story, and Cat Woman's story was disturbing which added darkness to the story. Put them together and you have a movie that's disturbingly depressing (or Depressingly Disturbing which ever you prefer.) Batman himself was played for the last time by Michael Keaton. A lot of people were mad when Keaton didn't return in the last two films for this series but personally I was OK with it. It's not that I think that he's a bad actor, as much as I think that he wasn't a convincing Batman (he doesn't look the part for starters). The rest of the acting was good. Particularly Christopher Walken as Max. He did a great job. I just don't think that a movie that doubles up on negative emotions is a good way to get buyers. And so thus, after one successful movie, the Batman franchise began to fail.
