 <sinopse>
  Convinced his thesis will have him graduate with honors from Harvard University, a stuffy student finds himself at the mercy of a homeless man's demands when he holds the papers hostage.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Monty is a student, and when his computer crashes, he's left with only a single paper copy of his thesis. Frightened of losing it, he immediately rushes out to photocopy it, only to stumble and drop it down a grate. Searching the basement of the building, he discovers that it has been found by Simon, a squatter. Simon makes a deal with Monty: for every day's accomodation and food that Monty gives him, he will give a page of the thesis in return.

    One of the most implausible story-lines ever has a crude Harvard student (Brendan Fraser) befriending a stinky homeless derelict (Joe Pesci) who softens up the kid by offering 'sage advice' concerning life and love. While Fraser spends some quality time with "The Bum" talking gibberish in the campus library and batting snowballs in an empty field, his roommates stand around exchanging meaningless banter, including Moira Kelly whose beauty could carry this movie single-handedly. Unfortunately, the writer William Mastrosimone was intent on making a statement about the 'hidden talents' of the homeless. With the exception of Fraser and Pesci, all the principal characters are very attractive (Moira, Patrick Dempsey, Josh Hamilton), but the script is very weak with several set-up lines of dialogue leading to some lame sexual innuendo. Meanwhile, Pesci's wino is stereotyped as an insane alcoholic. Not a very interesting film; it might have been better if the whole affair weren't telegraphed with predictability. Some nice shots of Harvard and later in the story, of New England's state of Maine.

    I saw this movie when it first came out. If not for the comedic scenes early on, I might have fallen asleep. I'm glad I didn't. We don't often see movies that have dialog as real as this one. This ensemble cast just...plain...works. The heart-breaking reunion and the final graduation scene are forever stamped into my memory. And the real meaning of "With Honors" will remain with me for all time. Years later, I still have several pebbles in a bag representing MY fondest memories. This is a movie for everyone. I have acquired many movies over the years, but this is still one of my all-time favorites. Only Brendan and Joe have gone on to "stardom", but the rest of the cast makes their roles possible and memorable

    A homeless slob who has all the charm of stepping in dog crap holds a Harvard student's thesis for the ransom of a glazed donut ("and make sure the glaze is not all broke") and a new pair of shorts ("go get me some underpants!"). Let me get this straight... we're supposed to 'like' this guy? Well hell, who wouldn't? He does the cutest things -- he attacks the Harvard student with a lead pipe, he looks through other people's closets, he steals brewskis from the fridge, he disrupts a professor's lecture class, he kills and eats another student's pet rooster, he warms his stinky socks in the oven, and he makes the Harvard kid drive him across the state line on the day his thesis is due. Oh yeah, I just love the sonuvabitch. P.S. If Moira Kelly was my roommate, she'd wake up one morning and see me standing at her bedside totally naked with a raging-- well, never mind.

    I saw this movie as a kid, maybe 13/14 in which I could still fill the gaps and magnify the story by sheer force of imagination and innocence. Today I saw it again as a young adult and while the film-making doesn't shine and the acting isn't as top notch as I had remembered it, the movie still delivers a warm feeling. This is the type of movie that unfortunately doesn't get made in Hollywood anymore. A simple premise,contrived scope, time frame and number of characters and an optimistic view of the world and people. As a child this perspectives filled the TV and cinema,everything had a moral and the bad guy was always defeated. Today, the movies don't carry the same idealistic view on human nature, preferring the darker(some will claim more realistic) approach on character and plot development. I rather that we had stories of hope than displays of human atrocities. "When we are dreaming alone it is only a dream. When we are dreaming with others, it is the beginning of reality." ---Dom Helder Camera

    Many contrived, corny moments mixed in with smart ideas (see Joe Pesci's speech on the Founding Fathers), humor (see Joe Pesci's bath), and poetry (Walt Whitman's death poem). If you thought "Pursuit of Happiness" was the best movie ever, you'll find this moving. There's nothing new in this movie to be said you can't find in better form elsewhere, which is why I gave it below a 7/10. IMO, as long as you don't take it too seriously and you're with a silly friend or possibly a good plate of food to take the phony-Hollywood-fabrication edge off, it's worth seeing.

    I always thought that Brenden Fraser had his time on the big screen before he disappeared. I always took him for a comedian. That was until I saw this movie. The plot revolves around a college student named Monty Kessler (Brenden Fraser) who loses his thesis that he has to turn in. It falls through a grating and ends up in the boiler room where he catches a homeless man named Simon (Joe Pesci) burning the pages one by one. Simon offers Monty a deal. He'll give Monty one page of his thesis for every one thing Monty gives him such as food, books, blankets, shelter, etc. Soon, Monty and Simon form a relationship and later Monty finds out that Simon is dying from Asbestosis. It is a really good film. A great drama that tugs at your heart. If you like these types of films, definitely pick this one up. I give this movie 9 stars out of 10. Excellent drama!

    Harvard punk (Brendan Fraser) helps a homeless dude (Joe Pesci) in exchange for lost thesis papers. It's a series of revelations that change the political views of a selfish Ivy-leaguer as he learns from the 'wisdom' of a bum who has all the appeal of a rat-dropping. The homeless are depicted as insane alcoholics while Fraser's roommates include cute Moira Kelly, cool Patrick Dempsey, and handsome Josh Hamilton, who are given virtually nothing to do. Not much here, but there is some good location scenery of Cambridge and Harvard University. Ve Ri Tas!

    It's a good movie to sit down with on a night with friends. I'm not going to summarise the movie 'cos plenty of reviewers have already done that and quite well. You can guess the ending once Simon's taken to the doctor's, but the road to the end is endearing with teeny surprises along the way. This has to be one of my best college dramas out there - far more PG than St. Elmo's Fire but as engaging. I'll watch it again and will recommend it to anyone who likes American college dramas. I've got nothing else to say but I have to pad to reach 10 lines so that i submit this. I'm now watching Eulogy - maybe I'll have 10 lines to write about that when I'm done. Oh well!

    Sweet memories... I remember watching this movie just hours before I had my first month celebration with my girlfriend at the time. It was a cold night as far as I remember. This movie moved me because it taught me a lesson about forgiving, changing for good, but most important of all; not handling with the future adequately. The plot is moving and convincing for an audience that enjoys these kind of movies. If you liked "Scent of a Woman" for example, "With Honors" will please you completely. I won't get into the plot because many people what reviewed it but all I can tell you is that the performances and plot will leave you with a smile. Pesci's performance is terrific.

    This is Brendan Fraiser's best performance to date because you actually love the character. He has given his character such a warmth and pitiful soul that you can't help but root for him in everything he does and what he stands for. The script is phenomenal and takes you through the film without even considering the film itself...before you know it the film has finished and you are left breathless and emotional. The acting is also very good and Moria Kelly is such a driving force and I believe this is one of the greatest acting collaborations ever seen. Over the top? See the film and find out for yourself. You will laugh, cry and consider your own view of the world and how you can change it for the better. One of the best films of the decade. The perfect summary of a world being taken in the wrong direction.

The plot revolves around a college student named Monty Kessler (Brenden Fraser) who loses his thesis that he has to turn in. It falls through a grating and ends up in the boiler room where he catches a homeless man named Simon (Joe Pesci) burning the pages one by one. Simon offers Monty a deal. He'll give Monty one page of his thesis for every one thing Monty gives him such as food, books, blankets, shelter, etc. Soon, Monty and Simon form a relationship and later Monty finds out that Simon is dying from Asbestosis. It is a really good film. A great drama that tugs at your heart. If you like these types of films, definitely pick this one up. I give this movie 9 stars out of 10. Excellent drama!

    Harvard punk (Brendan Fraser) helps a homeless dude (Joe Pesci) in exchange for lost thesis papers. It's a series of revelations that change the political views of a selfish Ivy-leaguer as he learns from the 'wisdom' of a bum who has all the appeal of a rat-dropping. The homeless are depicted as insane alcoholics while Fraser's roommates include cute Moira Kelly, cool Patrick Dempsey, and handsome Josh Hamilton, who are given virtually nothing to do. Not much here, but there is some good location scenery of Cambridge and Harvard University. Ve Ri Tas!

    It's a good movie to sit down with on a night with friends. I'm not going to summarise the movie 'cos plenty of reviewers have already done that and quite well. You can guess the ending once Simon's taken to the doctor's, but the road to the end is endearing with teeny surprises along the way. This has to be one of my best college dramas out there - far more PG than St. Elmo's Fire but as engaging. I'll watch it again and will recommend it to anyone who likes American college dramas. I've got nothing else to say but I have to pad to reach 10 lines so that i submit this. I'm now watching Eulogy - maybe I'll have 10 lines to write about that when I'm done. Oh well!

    Sweet memories... I remember watching this movie just hours before I had my first month celebration with my girlfriend at the time. It was a cold night as far as I remember. This movie moved me because it taught me a lesson about forgiving, changing for good, but most important of all; not handling with the future adequately. The plot is moving and convincing for an audience that enjoys these kind of movies. If you liked "Scent of a Woman" for example, "With Honors" will please you completely. I won't get into the plot because many people what reviewed it but all I can tell you is that the performances and plot will leave you with a smile. Pesci's performance is terrific.

    This is Brendan Fraiser's best performance to date because you actually love the character. He has given his character such a warmth and pitiful soul that you can't help but root for him in everything he does and what he stands for. The script is phenomenal and takes you through the film without even considering the film itself...before you know it the film has finished and you are left breathless and emotional. The acting is also very good and Moria Kelly is such a driving force and I believe this is one of the greatest acting collaborations ever seen. Over the top? See the film and find out for yourself. You will laugh, cry and consider your own view of the world and how you can change it for the better. One of the best films of the decade. The perfect summary of a world being taken in the wrong direction.

    One of the most implausible story-lines ever has a crude Harvard student (Brendan Fraser) befriending a stinky homeless derelict (Joe Pesci) who softens up the kid by offering 'sage advice' concerning life and love. While Fraser spends some quality time with "The Bum" talking gibberish in the campus library and batting snowballs in an empty field, his roommates stand around exchanging meaningless banter, including Moira Kelly whose beauty could carry this movie single-handedly. Unfortunately, the writer William Mastrosimone was intent on making a statement about the 'hidden talents' of the homeless. With the exception of Fraser and Pesci, all the principal characters are very attractive (Moira, Patrick Dempsey, Josh Hamilton), but the script is very weak with several set-up lines of dialogue leading to some lame sexual innuendo. Meanwhile, Pesci's wino is stereotyped as an insane alcoholic. Not a very interesting film; it might have been better if the whole affair weren't telegraphed with predictability. Some nice shots of Harvard and later in the story, of New England's state of Maine.

    I saw this movie when it first came out. If not for the comedic scenes early on, I might have fallen asleep. I'm glad I didn't. We don't often see movies that have dialog as real as this one. This ensemble cast just...plain...works. The heart-breaking reunion and the final graduation scene are forever stamped into my memory. And the real meaning of "With Honors" will remain with me for all time. Years later, I still have several pebbles in a bag representing MY fondest memories. This is a movie for everyone. I have acquired many movies over the years, but this is still one of my all-time favorites. Only Brendan and Joe have gone on to "stardom", but the rest of the cast makes their roles possible and memorable

    A homeless slob who has all the charm of stepping in dog crap holds a Harvard student's thesis for the ransom of a glazed donut ("and make sure the glaze is not all broke") and a new pair of shorts ("go get me some underpants!"). Let me get this straight... we're supposed to 'like' this guy? Well hell, who wouldn't? He does the cutest things -- he attacks the Harvard student with a lead pipe, he looks through other people's closets, he steals brewskis from the fridge, he disrupts a professor's lecture class, he kills and eats another student's pet rooster, he warms his stinky socks in the oven, and he makes the Harvard kid drive him across the state line on the day his thesis is due. Oh yeah, I just love the sonuvabitch. P.S. If Moira Kelly was my roommate, she'd wake up one morning and see me standing at her bedside totally naked with a raging-- well, never mind.

    I saw this movie as a kid, maybe 13/14 in which I could still fill the gaps and magnify the story by sheer force of imagination and innocence. Today I saw it again as a young adult and while the film-making doesn't shine and the acting isn't as top notch as I had remembered it, the movie still delivers a warm feeling. This is the type of movie that unfortunately doesn't get made in Hollywood anymore. A simple premise,contrived scope, time frame and number of characters and an optimistic view of the world and people. As a child this perspectives filled the TV and cinema,everything had a moral and the bad guy was always defeated. Today, the movies don't carry the same idealistic view on human nature, preferring the darker(some will claim more realistic) approach on character and plot development. I rather that we had stories of hope than displays of human atrocities. "When we are dreaming alone it is only a dream. When we are dreaming with others, it is the beginning of reality." ---Dom Helder Camera

    Many contrived, corny moments mixed in with smart ideas (see Joe Pesci's speech on the Founding Fathers), humor (see Joe Pesci's bath), and poetry (Walt Whitman's death poem). If you thought "Pursuit of Happiness" was the best movie ever, you'll find this moving. There's nothing new in this movie to be said you can't find in better form elsewhere, which is why I gave it below a 7/10. IMO, as long as you don't take it too seriously and you're with a silly friend or possibly a good plate of food to take the phony-Hollywood-fabrication edge off, it's worth seeing.

    I saw this movie as a kid, maybe 13/14 in which I could still fill the gaps and magnify the story by sheer force of imagination and innocence. Today I saw it again as a young adult and while the film-making doesn't shine and the acting isn't as top notch as I had remembered it, the movie still delivers a warm feeling. This is the type of movie that unfortunately doesn't get made in Hollywood anymore. A simple premise,contrived scope, time frame and number of characters and an optimistic view of the world and people. As a child this perspectives filled the TV and cinema,everything had a moral and the bad guy was always defeated. Today, the movies don't carry the same idealistic view on human nature, preferring the darker(some will claim more realistic) approach on character and plot development. I rather that we had stories of hope than displays of human atrocities. "When we are dreaming alone it is only a dream. When we are dreaming with others, it is the beginning of reality." ---Dom Helder Camera

    Many contrived, corny moments mixed in with smart ideas (see Joe Pesci's speech on the Founding Fathers), humor (see Joe Pesci's bath), and poetry (Walt Whitman's death poem). If you thought "Pursuit of Happiness" was the best movie ever, you'll find this moving. There's nothing new in this movie to be said you can't find in better form elsewhere, which is why I gave it below a 7/10. IMO, as long as you don't take it too seriously and you're with a silly friend or possibly a good plate of food to take the phony-Hollywood-fabrication edge off, it's worth seeing.

    I always thought that Brenden Fraser had his time on the big screen before he disappeared. I always took him for a comedian. That was until I saw this movie. The plot revolves around a college student named Monty Kessler (Brenden Fraser) who loses his thesis that he has to turn in. It falls through a grating and ends up in the boiler room where he catches a homeless man named Simon (Joe Pesci) burning the pages one by one. Simon offers Monty a deal. He'll give Monty one page of his thesis for every one thing Monty gives him such as food, books, blankets, shelter, etc. Soon, Monty and Simon form a relationship and later Monty finds out that Simon is dying from Asbestosis. It is a really good film. A great drama that tugs at your heart. If you like these types of films, definitely pick this one up. I give this movie 9 stars out of 10. Excellent drama!

    Harvard punk (Brendan Fraser) helps a homeless dude (Joe Pesci) in exchange for lost thesis papers. It's a series of revelations that change the political views of a selfish Ivy-leaguer as he learns from the 'wisdom' of a bum who has all the appeal of a rat-dropping. The homeless are depicted as insane alcoholics while Fraser's roommates include cute Moira Kelly, cool Patrick Dempsey, and handsome Josh Hamilton, who are given virtually nothing to do. Not much here, but there is some good location scenery of Cambridge and Harvard University. Ve Ri Tas!

    It's a good movie to sit down with on a night with friends. I'm not going to summarise the movie 'cos plenty of reviewers have already done that and quite well. You can guess the ending once Simon's taken to the doctor's, but the road to the end is endearing with teeny surprises along the way. This has to be one of my best college dramas out there - far more PG than St. Elmo's Fire but as engaging. I'll watch it again and will recommend it to anyone who likes American college dramas. I've got nothing else to say but I have to pad to reach 10 lines so that i submit this. I'm now watching Eulogy - maybe I'll have 10 lines to write about that when I'm done. Oh well!

    Sweet memories... I remember watching this movie just hours before I had my first month celebration with my girlfriend at the time. It was a cold night as far as I remember. This movie moved me because it taught me a lesson about forgiving, changing for good, but most important of all; not handling with the future adequately. The plot is moving and convincing for an audience that enjoys these kind of movies. If you liked "Scent of a Woman" for example, "With Honors" will please you completely. I won't get into the plot because many people what reviewed it but all I can tell you is that the performances and plot will leave you with a smile. Pesci's performance is terrific.

    This is Brendan Fraiser's best performance to date because you actually love the character. He has given his character such a warmth and pitiful soul that you can't help but root for him in everything he does and what he stands for. The script is phenomenal and takes you through the film without even considering the film itself...before you know it the film has finished and you are left breathless and emotional. The acting is also very good and Moria Kelly is such a driving force and I believe this is one of the greatest acting collaborations ever seen. Over the top? See the film and find out for yourself. You will laugh, cry and consider your own view of the world and how you can change it for the better. One of the best films of the decade. The perfect summary of a world being taken in the wrong direction.

    One of the most implausible story-lines ever has a crude Harvard student (Brendan Fraser) befriending a stinky homeless derelict (Joe Pesci) who softens up the kid by offering 'sage advice' concerning life and love. While Fraser spends some quality time with "The Bum" talking gibberish in the campus library and batting snowballs in an empty field, his roommates stand around exchanging meaningless banter, including Moira Kelly whose beauty could carry this movie single-handedly. Unfortunately, the writer William Mastrosimone was intent on making a statement about the 'hidden talents' of the homeless. With the exception of Fraser and Pesci, all the principal characters are very attractive (Moira, Patrick Dempsey, Josh Hamilton), but the script is very weak with several set-up lines of dialogue leading to some lame sexual innuendo. Meanwhile, Pesci's wino is stereotyped as an insane alcoholic. Not a very interesting film; it might have been better if the whole affair weren't telegraphed with predictability. Some nice shots of Harvard and later in the story, of New England's state of Maine.

    I saw this movie when it first came out. If not for the comedic scenes early on, I might have fallen asleep. I'm glad I didn't. We don't often see movies that have dialog as real as this one. This ensemble cast just...plain...works. The heart-breaking reunion and the final graduation scene are forever stamped into my memory. And the real meaning of "With Honors" will remain with me for all time. Years later, I still have several pebbles in a bag representing MY fondest memories. This is a movie for everyone. I have acquired many movies over the years, but this is still one of my all-time favorites. Only Brendan and Joe have gone on to "stardom", but the rest of the cast makes their roles possible and memorable

    A homeless slob who has all the charm of stepping in dog crap holds a Harvard student's thesis for the ransom of a glazed donut ("and make sure the glaze is not all broke") and a new pair of shorts ("go get me some underpants!"). Let me get this straight... we're supposed to 'like' this guy? Well hell, who wouldn't? He does the cutest things -- he attacks the Harvard student with a lead pipe, he looks through other people's closets, he steals brewskis from the fridge, he disrupts a professor's lecture class, he kills and eats another student's pet rooster, he warms his stinky socks in the oven, and he makes the Harvard kid drive him across the state line on the day his thesis is due. Oh yeah, I just love the sonuvabitch. P.S. If Moira Kelly was my roommate, she'd wake up one morning and see me standing at her bedside totally naked with a raging-- well, never mind.
