    The tale of the 14th Dalai Lama is very much like the story of the Last Emperor of China, Pu Yi. A boy handpicked to be a ruler of a country, grown up within confined solitude, kicked out of reign from Communist China, and then labeled as a criminal. The only real significance is that Pu Yi faced years in a concentration camp while the Dalai Lama managed to escape to India. That aside, it is not surprising to find in Scorsese's "Kundun" that he was heavily inspired by Bernardo Bertolucci's epic film "The Last Emperor". There were times when I was watching "Kundun" that I could not help wonder if this was an unofficial sequel. The costumes, techniques of candle lit lighting at night, story arc, and overall biography character-type was similar. I am not claiming Scorsese a copycat at all. It's just these two films are so alike. Just one happens to be about China's ruler and the other Tibet's. What worked so well for "The Last Emperor" is that despite its fancy set pieces and costumes, Bertolucci punched good in character drama and an overall intriguing plot. "Kundun" lacks both of these. Each scene in this movie drifts from one part of the Dalai Lama's life to another chronologically and in a sort of schizophrenic nature-the movie itself does not seem to know what it is really about. This is the biggest danger a filmmaker can fall into in making a bio-pic film, trying to cover too much ground without enough time nor interest to piece it all together. The acting suffers not from bad actors, but bad writing. Every moment is devoid of emotion, depicting every Tibetan character in a careless monotone. Then again, most characters are Buddhist monks and emotion is not their strong point. When I watch a movie, however, I expect to be engaged by an actor's talent. This magic is lost in this movie. "Kundun" does succeed at least in the technical aspects. Roger Deakins cinematography is stunning to watch and almost pushes the barrier on what can be done with a camera, whether it be an elaborate steadi-cam shot or a detailed close-up. Philip Glass's score creates a sort of mood that hints to an ethereal supernaturalism, combined with a brooding choir, a lush percussion, and bombastic brass. It supports the visual images nicely. I admit that it seems to take over the movie to the point that there is no other sound present, especially with the horn blasts of flatulence caliber. The one factor that presented mild interest for me was how fair Scorsese treated the Tibetan culture. Little nuances like the funeral rites, the teachings of Buddha, and the Dalai Lama's philosophy are interesting. Yet great cinematography, a sublime soundtrack, and a good treatment of a lost culture cannot save a film. It is a bit disheartening since Scorsese has made some very good movies outside of the gangster genre (ex: Hugo, Shutter Island). While he kept his visuals and artsy elements at full throttle, all other elements are at a loss. This kind of movie is clearly not his cup of tea.

    Kundun is a movie about the search for the Dalai Llama. In the beginning, a monk comes to search for the next Dalai Llama. He finds a young boy named Lhamo, who initially seems like a very self-centered, short-tempered child. However, the monks give Lhamo a test by placing a series of objects in front of him, to see if he will chose the objects that belonged to the preceding Dalai Llama. Then, upon passing the test, Lhamo is taken to the monastery where he begins to grow up and mature. He meets Regent Reting Rinpoche, who was the man that discovered Lhamo's existence through a vision he had while sleeping. However, the Chinese Communists imprison and kill Regent Reting Rinpoche, and Lhamo meets with Chairman Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong expresses to Lhamo that "religion is poison", and they are never able to settle on any agreements. Lhamo, upon being pursued by the Chinese, flees to the Indian Mountains. At a mountain border crossing, an Indian guard asks Lhamo if he is the Lord Buddha, and Lhamo replies, "I think that I am a reflection, like the moon on water. When you see me, and I try to be a good man, you see yourself." Personally, one of my favorite parts about the movie was the scene where Lhamo is picking up the objects that are placed in front of him by the monks. It's a very exciting scene, as Lhamo initially gives off the impression that he is a very spoiled child, and it's hard to imagine that he will chose the correct objects and eventually train to become the Dalai Llama. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a particular interest in the process of discovering the next Dalai Llama, and is interested in the political aspect and implications of being the leader of a religious group.

    I saw the movie "Kundun" recently, directed by Martin Scorsese. This movie was somewhat reminiscent to that of "The Last Emperor" (the movie depicting the life of Puyi). But rather, takes on more of a religious perspective, showing the life of the 14th Dalai Lama. The movie was set in a beautiful location, with magnificent views of the Tibetan mountainous region. The music really went well with the visuals. It didn't draw attention nor did it put me to sleep. The graphics and setting of the film was spectacular and one of the best. I especially liked the scene when Kundun was washing away the sand mandala. The costumes of the Buddhist monks were very well detailed and interesting. I enjoyed the serenity of the backdrop, which really gave a relaxing feel to the film. I felt that this movie left out a lot of significant parts of the the Dalai Lama. They left out how his life after his exile, which I think is important as to the development of him today. It should include scenes where the Dalai Lama was appealing to foreign countries for refuge and aid. The actors of the film were good portrayals, especially both of the young and middle-age Kundun. The only bad portrayal was of Mao Zedong. The actor didn't really resemble him well and his acting as Chairman Mao had gone overboard. The entire movie revolved mostly around the Chinese Communist Party claiming Tibet and forcing the Dalai Lama out, instead it should focus more on the Dalai Lama's spiritual journey at the same time. The theme of government against religion is significant in today's ever changing society and I believe it was well filmed. There should be a balance of Dalai Lama's religious influence yet at the same time showing his history. The film had it's good points especially the fascinating process of finding Kundun and how he dealt with other people. This film is more suited to those who enjoy a great historical depiction of a man who went on a religious journey influenced by politics of the Chinese Communist Party. The also had brilliant scenery. This is definitely one of Martin Scorsese's best films so far.

    I think I am well versed in Buddhism to say that, contrary to the majority opinion, this is a superficial smattering of a wonderful practice. I don't know whose fault it is, certainly Scorsese's though he is an outsider so that is sort of to be expected. I suspect the Dalai Lama's circle were fine with a superficially romantic portrayal, so long as it generates awareness for their just cause. Why do I say this? The main narrative device that gives this any sort of shape (otherwise it is one long picture-pretty rambling), is the DL meditating in exile, possibly at that balcony at the Indian border, possibly at a much later time. This would be in line with the recurring motifs of prescient visions and the spyglass (looking from a distance) which is first introduced right after the screening of a silent film (the association is with memory, illusions and time gone - all things to purify the mind from in meditation). This would somewhat excuse the fragmentary nature of the narrative and quaint focus of it on young boy versus evil empire of millions, since it was all experienced from his end. Somewhat. It is still absolutely tepid as a historic film if we switch to the 'objective' pov. Now, this last segment of the crossing to India is accompanied by the one powerful visual meditation in the film, it is not mentioned but what you see is the Kalachakra initiation with the Great Sand Mandala being constructed and brushed away, a powerful and sacred occasion. Get it? This is it, this one moment. The DL is heartbroken and his courage waning, and lost in meditation, he finds peace in reminding himself of the transience of all things, which is what the ritual represents and a core Buddhist precept, the cosmos being washed away back into river-sand. The entire rest of the film is a pageant; oracles hiss, rituals go on, dances, ornate ceremonies, hushed whispers of banality. Scorsese mistakes here the theater of appearances (the religion) for the essence. He films the ritual as the thing-in-itself, as spectacle, instead of as the space that allows you to cultivate a compassionate mind. The postcard instead of the real spiritual landscape. How rich this would be if, for instance, we had contrasts between flows of remembered ordinary life and abstractions in three- and twodimensional space in the dances and mandala, and all of that (all the costumes, the ceremonies, the symbols and human suffering) understood as different sides of one image -empty- brushed away as the mind heals itself. I am in awe of the possibilities! No dice. Scorsese films operatic platitudes. Skip this if you want to know Buddhism. Go straight for Why Did Bodhidharma Left for the East? or even Herzog's Buddhist doc, which he also filmed around the Kalachakra. Blowup, if you want deep, incidentally Buddhist essaying on the roots of suffering.

    Probably the foremost reason why most people are disappointed with this movie is because it's a Martin Scorsese movie, without anything about it that screams out Martin Scorsese. It probably was simply a subject he had a real interest and love for, which blinded him it seems. Sure, it focuses on its main subject but everything surrounding it gets completely ignored it seemed, which made this movie mostly a disappointing watch. Don't go watch this movie expecting to learn everything about Tibet, Buddhism or the Dalai Lama. Seriously, after watching this movie I don't feel like I have learned anything. It doesn't explain anything about the religion and rituals, or tells you what the Dalai Lama is all about and what he stands for. It actually made this a very shallow movie experience, which I never could feel involved with. The only way I could see this movie being interesting, is if you are already into the subject and have some basic knowledge about it. For a movie with a subject such as this one has, it's surprisingly lacking depth. You would expect the movie to be filled with ancient wisdoms concerning spirituality, knowledge and peace. Absolutely none of that present in this movie. It simply follows its main subject around and that's it really. Evertyhing that happens around him and every story aspects that potentially could had been interesting gets handled poorly and all remains very underdeveloped. Another thing that felt wrong about this movie was its acting. The movie uses non-professionals of Tibetan descent, forced to speak English. If first of all feels wrong to hear them all speak English but next to that, the acting itself from most of the actors is far from anything too impressive. No, it's not like I hated this movie. After all, it remains perfectly watchable but it never got interesting or involving enough in any way. What saves it is that it's still a technically well made movie, that is great looking as well. Most people will praise the cinematographer or director for this but in some cases, such as this one, you should simply give most credit the natural environments. I mean, I don't think it was possible for the film-makers to let this movie look ugly, even if they tried really hard to do so. Too distant and shallow to call this a great or recommendable movie. 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Kundun is legendary film director Martin Scorsese's follow-up to his 1995 masterpiece, Casino. I watched this considering how much I love Martin Scorsese, and when I watched it, I was astounded! Kundun is outstanding from start to finish, it is absolutely dazzling and astonishing! By the way, Kundun is about this: from childhood until adulthood, Tibet's 14th dalai lama deals with Chinese oppression and other problems. Before I continue, let my say something. Why did I like this movie? I liked it for a number of reasons. I did not like it just because it is directed by my all time favorite film director, Martin Scorsese, I liked it for other reasons, such as the acting, the scenery, and especially, the costumes. The costumes in this movie were stupendous, the person who designed them should have been at least nominated for the Academy Award For Best Costume Design, or possibly even won. Kundun scores another great movie for Martin Scorsese, it is big proof of his fabulous talent at directing movies! When I watched this movie, I decided to think of it not as a Martin Scorsese movie, but as a movie, and when it was over, I simply was blown away! It is really interesting that the same man who directed classics like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Casino, and Raging Bull would direct such a great movie like this! But this was not the end for good ol' Martin Scorsese, he would eventually direct Gangs Of New York in 2002, The Avaitor in 2004, and not to mention, The Departed in 2006, which brought him the Academy Award for Best Director. But getting back to Kundun, he has once again managed to astonish us with his fabulous directing talents! It is really amazing that even as Scorsese gets old, he hasn't lost his touch at directing, one of the few other directors besides him who was like that is Sidney Lumet, proved that with his last film, Before The Devil Knows You're Dead. Kundun is absolutely superb, it has results that must be seen in order to be believed. If you haven't seen this movie, then watch it. Why? Because it's excellent, it is one of the best films of 1997. Scorsese is also good at telling a story. When he tells a story, the story grabs hold of you and it holds on until the very minute that the end credits begin to roll, yes, it really is that compelling, it simply won't let go of you until the end of a movie. This happened to me in quite a few Scorsese films, such as Goodfellas, The Departed, Casino, and the very film I talking about right now, Kundun. Allow Martin Scorsese to once again show that he is one of the greatest film directors ever made when you watch Kundun, because when you watch it, you will be thrilled by what you will see. Trust me, when you watch this film, you will see what I mean when I say that this film is great, because it is great! 10/10

    Martin Scorsese recounts the official version of the Dalai Lama's biography from his birth until the onset of his exile in India in 1959. In stunning images. That's it. And that's not enough. None of Marty's extraordinary narrative style is apparent here (although the movie is a showcase for cameraman Roger Deakins, who has since become the cinematographer of choice for the Coen brothers). Since the Dalai Lama is a real, and really ambivalent, political as well as religious figure, offering up a glossy 2-hours commercial on him simply isn't enough. The most egregious example of the movie's intentional superficiality is when the deposed Tibetan regent Reting Rinpoche perishes in the dungeons of the Potala palace and the Dalai Lama reacts to this by ... erm, performing a noble blessing gesture and then doing feck all. Was he in on it himself, or at least aware that there was a conspiracy, which he chose to ignore? But for what reasons? This movie won't tell you. It just wallows on in beautiful images.

    OK. Lately I've watched nothing but horror movies and silly comedies so I thought I would broaden my horizons somewhat and grab a more serious film and perhaps try to learn something for a change. I've now done that and can't say I feel that appreciably better for the experience. It must be a pretty weird feeling for a 2 or 3 year old kid to be told he is to run a country, and one that I might never experience - given I am nearer 40. The problem with Kundun is the subject matter. The movie concerns the discovery and life of the 14th (and current) Dalai Lama, and of course there is a fair amount of time focusing on the Chinese invasion and occupation of Tibet. Now I am not saying this isn't a worthwhile and amazing life, only that most people with a 7th grade education know this already, and unlike say "Saving Private Ryan", where we know the story but go for the ride because of the action, there just isn't much action to be found in Kundun. We meet the 14th Dalai Lama when his folks still call him his given name, which I don't remember hearing. Once he is chosen, he is immediately taken from his parents for training over the ensuing years to be the spiritual leader of Tibet. Being a pre-pubescent leader of a nation has its disadvantages believe it or not, at one point the young Dalai Lama is being briefed on the less than friendly intentions of neighbouring China, being reasonably practical he asks: "How many soldiers (does Tibet have)?" "5,000" "So many! That's a lot, well we are safe here." Of course then China decides that when you are a billion strong "No" doesn't necessarily mean "No", they invade and commence an occupation of Tibet. They attempt to influence the people and grease the wheels through manipulating the Dalai Lama - who initially fled for his safety, only to return to face the music and be a figurehead to his people. According to the film the discussions and dealings between the Chinese and the Dalai Lama were cordial and mostly above board, again in reality history has not been so kind to the Chinese where the dealings with the Tibetan people are concerned. I am amazed with the access that the Chinese people had that they never killed him, regardless of the backlash from a people that already resented their presence. As we all now know the Dalai Lama is one of the most revered pacifists on the planet, and unfortunately relations between Tibet and China are still frosty at best. Throughout the entire period of exile - which now spans many decades - he has maintained that China must leave Tibet but has never suggested violence or aggressive action of any kind. His teachings are followed (more than) fervently by millions and in reality the world would be a far better place if even more people lived a little more like him. But I am not discussing his life or existence, merely Martin Scorscese's representation of it, and unfortunately while it is a worthwhile story that deserves telling, if you are aware of the basics it doesn't bring much more to the table than a Movie of the Week. Final Rating for the Dalai Lama  10 / 10. Great bloke. We should all try to be more like him in our daily lives. Final Rating  7 / 10. If you don't know the basics of the 14th Dalai Lama's life, watch it for the information. If you do it doesn't bring much more to the table.

    This is quite a long movie, as most historical type movies tend to be. Kundun clearly has meaning for the Darli Lama and I have watched this movie for first time thirteen years after its original release, a filler in summer 2010 when there are no more good movies to watch at the moment. Watched it with my 12 year old son who turned to the net afterwards to check information about the Dar ly Lama and Tibet and also the Chinese invasion of Tibet. It is a beautiful film and the story is well told, if a little slow and tedious at times. this is in a different category of film making for Martin Scorsese and this will for me stay in the memory. A film for all ages, nothing graphically or verbally uncomfortable about this movie, it does the job of entertaining me one Sunday afternoon!

    I excepted a lot from this movie, and it did deliver. There is some great Buddhist wisdom in this movie. The real Dalai Lama is a very interesting person, and I think there is a lot of wisdom in Buddhism. The music, of course, sounds like Koyanisquatsi because it is by Philip Glass. This adds to the beauty of the movie. Whereas other biographies of famous people tend to get very poor this movie always stays focused and gives a good and honest portrayal of the Dalai Lama. All things being equal, it is a great movie, and I really enjoyed it. It is not like Taxi Driver of course but as a biography of a famous person it is really a great film indeed.

The film had it's good points especially the fascinating process of finding Kundun and how he dealt with other people. This film is more suited to those who enjoy a great historical depiction of a man who went on a religious journey influenced by politics of the Chinese Communist Party. The also had brilliant scenery. This is definitely one of Martin Scorsese's best films so far.

    I think I am well versed in Buddhism to say that, contrary to the majority opinion, this is a superficial smattering of a wonderful practice. I don't know whose fault it is, certainly Scorsese's though he is an outsider so that is sort of to be expected. I suspect the Dalai Lama's circle were fine with a superficially romantic portrayal, so long as it generates awareness for their just cause. Why do I say this? The main narrative device that gives this any sort of shape (otherwise it is one long picture-pretty rambling), is the DL meditating in exile, possibly at that balcony at the Indian border, possibly at a much later time. This would be in line with the recurring motifs of prescient visions and the spyglass (looking from a distance) which is first introduced right after the screening of a silent film (the association is with memory, illusions and time gone - all things to purify the mind from in meditation). This would somewhat excuse the fragmentary nature of the narrative and quaint focus of it on young boy versus evil empire of millions, since it was all experienced from his end. Somewhat. It is still absolutely tepid as a historic film if we switch to the 'objective' pov. Now, this last segment of the crossing to India is accompanied by the one powerful visual meditation in the film, it is not mentioned but what you see is the Kalachakra initiation with the Great Sand Mandala being constructed and brushed away, a powerful and sacred occasion. Get it? This is it, this one moment. The DL is heartbroken and his courage waning, and lost in meditation, he finds peace in reminding himself of the transience of all things, which is what the ritual represents and a core Buddhist precept, the cosmos being washed away back into river-sand. The entire rest of the film is a pageant; oracles hiss, rituals go on, dances, ornate ceremonies, hushed whispers of banality. Scorsese mistakes here the theater of appearances (the religion) for the essence. He films the ritual as the thing-in-itself, as spectacle, instead of as the space that allows you to cultivate a compassionate mind. The postcard instead of the real spiritual landscape. How rich this would be if, for instance, we had contrasts between flows of remembered ordinary life and abstractions in three- and twodimensional space in the dances and mandala, and all of that (all the costumes, the ceremonies, the symbols and human suffering) understood as different sides of one image -empty- brushed away as the mind heals itself. I am in awe of the possibilities! No dice. Scorsese films operatic platitudes. Skip this if you want to know Buddhism. Go straight for Why Did Bodhidharma Left for the East? or even Herzog's Buddhist doc, which he also filmed around the Kalachakra. Blowup, if you want deep, incidentally Buddhist essaying on the roots of suffering.

    Probably the foremost reason why most people are disappointed with this movie is because it's a Martin Scorsese movie, without anything about it that screams out Martin Scorsese. It probably was simply a subject he had a real interest and love for, which blinded him it seems. Sure, it focuses on its main subject but everything surrounding it gets completely ignored it seemed, which made this movie mostly a disappointing watch. Don't go watch this movie expecting to learn everything about Tibet, Buddhism or the Dalai Lama. Seriously, after watching this movie I don't feel like I have learned anything. It doesn't explain anything about the religion and rituals, or tells you what the Dalai Lama is all about and what he stands for. It actually made this a very shallow movie experience, which I never could feel involved with. The only way I could see this movie being interesting, is if you are already into the subject and have some basic knowledge about it. For a movie with a subject such as this one has, it's surprisingly lacking depth. You would expect the movie to be filled with ancient wisdoms concerning spirituality, knowledge and peace. Absolutely none of that present in this movie. It simply follows its main subject around and that's it really. Evertyhing that happens around him and every story aspects that potentially could had been interesting gets handled poorly and all remains very underdeveloped. Another thing that felt wrong about this movie was its acting. The movie uses non-professionals of Tibetan descent, forced to speak English. If first of all feels wrong to hear them all speak English but next to that, the acting itself from most of the actors is far from anything too impressive. No, it's not like I hated this movie. After all, it remains perfectly watchable but it never got interesting or involving enough in any way. What saves it is that it's still a technically well made movie, that is great looking as well. Most people will praise the cinematographer or director for this but in some cases, such as this one, you should simply give most credit the natural environments. I mean, I don't think it was possible for the film-makers to let this movie look ugly, even if they tried really hard to do so. Too distant and shallow to call this a great or recommendable movie. 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Kundun is legendary film director Martin Scorsese's follow-up to his 1995 masterpiece, Casino. I watched this considering how much I love Martin Scorsese, and when I watched it, I was astounded! Kundun is outstanding from start to finish, it is absolutely dazzling and astonishing! By the way, Kundun is about this: from childhood until adulthood, Tibet's 14th dalai lama deals with Chinese oppression and other problems. Before I continue, let my say something. Why did I like this movie? I liked it for a number of reasons. I did not like it just because it is directed by my all time favorite film director, Martin Scorsese, I liked it for other reasons, such as the acting, the scenery, and especially, the costumes. The costumes in this movie were stupendous, the person who designed them should have been at least nominated for the Academy Award For Best Costume Design, or possibly even won. Kundun scores another great movie for Martin Scorsese, it is big proof of his fabulous talent at directing movies! When I watched this movie, I decided to think of it not as a Martin Scorsese movie, but as a movie, and when it was over, I simply was blown away! It is really interesting that the same man who directed classics like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Casino, and Raging Bull would direct such a great movie like this! But this was not the end for good ol' Martin Scorsese, he would eventually direct Gangs Of New York in 2002, The Avaitor in 2004, and not to mention, The Departed in 2006, which brought him the Academy Award for Best Director. But getting back to Kundun, he has once again managed to astonish us with his fabulous directing talents! It is really amazing that even as Scorsese gets old, he hasn't lost his touch at directing, one of the few other directors besides him who was like that is Sidney Lumet, proved that with his last film, Before The Devil Knows You're Dead. Kundun is absolutely superb, it has results that must be seen in order to be believed. If you haven't seen this movie, then watch it. Why? Because it's excellent, it is one of the best films of 1997. Scorsese is also good at telling a story. When he tells a story, the story grabs hold of you and it holds on until the very minute that the end credits begin to roll, yes, it really is that compelling, it simply won't let go of you until the end of a movie. This happened to me in quite a few Scorsese films, such as Goodfellas, The Departed, Casino, and the very film I talking about right now, Kundun. Allow Martin Scorsese to once again show that he is one of the greatest film directors ever made when you watch Kundun, because when you watch it, you will be thrilled by what you will see. Trust me, when you watch this film, you will see what I mean when I say that this film is great, because it is great! 10/10

    Martin Scorsese recounts the official version of the Dalai Lama's biography from his birth until the onset of his exile in India in 1959. In stunning images. That's it. And that's not enough. None of Marty's extraordinary narrative style is apparent here (although the movie is a showcase for cameraman Roger Deakins, who has since become the cinematographer of choice for the Coen brothers). Since the Dalai Lama is a real, and really ambivalent, political as well as religious figure, offering up a glossy 2-hours commercial on him simply isn't enough. The most egregious example of the movie's intentional superficiality is when the deposed Tibetan regent Reting Rinpoche perishes in the dungeons of the Potala palace and the Dalai Lama reacts to this by ... erm, performing a noble blessing gesture and then doing feck all. Was he in on it himself, or at least aware that there was a conspiracy, which he chose to ignore? But for what reasons? This movie won't tell you. It just wallows on in beautiful images.

    OK. Lately I've watched nothing but horror movies and silly comedies so I thought I would broaden my horizons somewhat and grab a more serious film and perhaps try to learn something for a change. I've now done that and can't say I feel that appreciably better for the experience. It must be a pretty weird feeling for a 2 or 3 year old kid to be told he is to run a country, and one that I might never experience - given I am nearer 40. The problem with Kundun is the subject matter. The movie concerns the discovery and life of the 14th (and current) Dalai Lama, and of course there is a fair amount of time focusing on the Chinese invasion and occupation of Tibet. Now I am not saying this isn't a worthwhile and amazing life, only that most people with a 7th grade education know this already, and unlike say "Saving Private Ryan", where we know the story but go for the ride because of the action, there just isn't much action to be found in Kundun. We meet the 14th Dalai Lama when his folks still call him his given name, which I don't remember hearing. Once he is chosen, he is immediately taken from his parents for training over the ensuing years to be the spiritual leader of Tibet. Being a pre-pubescent leader of a nation has its disadvantages believe it or not, at one point the young Dalai Lama is being briefed on the less than friendly intentions of neighbouring China, being reasonably practical he asks: "How many soldiers (does Tibet have)?" "5,000" "So many! That's a lot, well we are safe here." Of course then China decides that when you are a billion strong "No" doesn't necessarily mean "No", they invade and commence an occupation of Tibet. They attempt to influence the people and grease the wheels through manipulating the Dalai Lama - who initially fled for his safety, only to return to face the music and be a figurehead to his people. According to the film the discussions and dealings between the Chinese and the Dalai Lama were cordial and mostly above board, again in reality history has not been so kind to the Chinese where the dealings with the Tibetan people are concerned. I am amazed with the access that the Chinese people had that they never killed him, regardless of the backlash from a people that already resented their presence. As we all now know the Dalai Lama is one of the most revered pacifists on the planet, and unfortunately relations between Tibet and China are still frosty at best. Throughout the entire period of exile - which now spans many decades - he has maintained that China must leave Tibet but has never suggested violence or aggressive action of any kind. His teachings are followed (more than) fervently by millions and in reality the world would be a far better place if even more people lived a little more like him. But I am not discussing his life or existence, merely Martin Scorscese's representation of it, and unfortunately while it is a worthwhile story that deserves telling, if you are aware of the basics it doesn't bring much more to the table than a Movie of the Week. Final Rating for the Dalai Lama  10 / 10. Great bloke. We should all try to be more like him in our daily lives. Final Rating  7 / 10. If you don't know the basics of the 14th Dalai Lama's life, watch it for the information. If you do it doesn't bring much more to the table.

    This is quite a long movie, as most historical type movies tend to be. Kundun clearly has meaning for the Darli Lama and I have watched this movie for first time thirteen years after its original release, a filler in summer 2010 when there are no more good movies to watch at the moment. Watched it with my 12 year old son who turned to the net afterwards to check information about the Dar ly Lama and Tibet and also the Chinese invasion of Tibet. It is a beautiful film and the story is well told, if a little slow and tedious at times. this is in a different category of film making for Martin Scorsese and this will for me stay in the memory. A film for all ages, nothing graphically or verbally uncomfortable about this movie, it does the job of entertaining me one Sunday afternoon!

    I excepted a lot from this movie, and it did deliver. There is some great Buddhist wisdom in this movie. The real Dalai Lama is a very interesting person, and I think there is a lot of wisdom in Buddhism. The music, of course, sounds like Koyanisquatsi because it is by Philip Glass. This adds to the beauty of the movie. Whereas other biographies of famous people tend to get very poor this movie always stays focused and gives a good and honest portrayal of the Dalai Lama. All things being equal, it is a great movie, and I really enjoyed it. It is not like Taxi Driver of course but as a biography of a famous person it is really a great film indeed.

    The tale of the 14th Dalai Lama is very much like the story of the Last Emperor of China, Pu Yi. A boy handpicked to be a ruler of a country, grown up within confined solitude, kicked out of reign from Communist China, and then labeled as a criminal. The only real significance is that Pu Yi faced years in a concentration camp while the Dalai Lama managed to escape to India. That aside, it is not surprising to find in Scorsese's "Kundun" that he was heavily inspired by Bernardo Bertolucci's epic film "The Last Emperor". There were times when I was watching "Kundun" that I could not help wonder if this was an unofficial sequel. The costumes, techniques of candle lit lighting at night, story arc, and overall biography character-type was similar. I am not claiming Scorsese a copycat at all. It's just these two films are so alike. Just one happens to be about China's ruler and the other Tibet's. What worked so well for "The Last Emperor" is that despite its fancy set pieces and costumes, Bertolucci punched good in character drama and an overall intriguing plot. "Kundun" lacks both of these. Each scene in this movie drifts from one part of the Dalai Lama's life to another chronologically and in a sort of schizophrenic nature-the movie itself does not seem to know what it is really about. This is the biggest danger a filmmaker can fall into in making a bio-pic film, trying to cover too much ground without enough time nor interest to piece it all together. The acting suffers not from bad actors, but bad writing. Every moment is devoid of emotion, depicting every Tibetan character in a careless monotone. Then again, most characters are Buddhist monks and emotion is not their strong point. When I watch a movie, however, I expect to be engaged by an actor's talent. This magic is lost in this movie. "Kundun" does succeed at least in the technical aspects. Roger Deakins cinematography is stunning to watch and almost pushes the barrier on what can be done with a camera, whether it be an elaborate steadi-cam shot or a detailed close-up. Philip Glass's score creates a sort of mood that hints to an ethereal supernaturalism, combined with a brooding choir, a lush percussion, and bombastic brass. It supports the visual images nicely. I admit that it seems to take over the movie to the point that there is no other sound present, especially with the horn blasts of flatulence caliber. The one factor that presented mild interest for me was how fair Scorsese treated the Tibetan culture. Little nuances like the funeral rites, the teachings of Buddha, and the Dalai Lama's philosophy are interesting. Yet great cinematography, a sublime soundtrack, and a good treatment of a lost culture cannot save a film. It is a bit disheartening since Scorsese has made some very good movies outside of the gangster genre (ex: Hugo, Shutter Island). While he kept his visuals and artsy elements at full throttle, all other elements are at a loss. This kind of movie is clearly not his cup of tea.

    Kundun is a movie about the search for the Dalai Llama. In the beginning, a monk comes to search for the next Dalai Llama. He finds a young boy named Lhamo, who initially seems like a very self-centered, short-tempered child. However, the monks give Lhamo a test by placing a series of objects in front of him, to see if he will chose the objects that belonged to the preceding Dalai Llama. Then, upon passing the test, Lhamo is taken to the monastery where he begins to grow up and mature. He meets Regent Reting Rinpoche, who was the man that discovered Lhamo's existence through a vision he had while sleeping. However, the Chinese Communists imprison and kill Regent Reting Rinpoche, and Lhamo meets with Chairman Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong expresses to Lhamo that "religion is poison", and they are never able to settle on any agreements. Lhamo, upon being pursued by the Chinese, flees to the Indian Mountains. At a mountain border crossing, an Indian guard asks Lhamo if he is the Lord Buddha, and Lhamo replies, "I think that I am a reflection, like the moon on water. When you see me, and I try to be a good man, you see yourself." Personally, one of my favorite parts about the movie was the scene where Lhamo is picking up the objects that are placed in front of him by the monks. It's a very exciting scene, as Lhamo initially gives off the impression that he is a very spoiled child, and it's hard to imagine that he will chose the correct objects and eventually train to become the Dalai Llama. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a particular interest in the process of discovering the next Dalai Llama, and is interested in the political aspect and implications of being the leader of a religious group.

    I saw the movie "Kundun" recently, directed by Martin Scorsese. This movie was somewhat reminiscent to that of "The Last Emperor" (the movie depicting the life of Puyi). But rather, takes on more of a religious perspective, showing the life of the 14th Dalai Lama. The movie was set in a beautiful location, with magnificent views of the Tibetan mountainous region. The music really went well with the visuals. It didn't draw attention nor did it put me to sleep. The graphics and setting of the film was spectacular and one of the best. I especially liked the scene when Kundun was washing away the sand mandala. The costumes of the Buddhist monks were very well detailed and interesting. I enjoyed the serenity of the backdrop, which really gave a relaxing feel to the film. I felt that this movie left out a lot of significant parts of the the Dalai Lama. They left out how his life after his exile, which I think is important as to the development of him today. It should include scenes where the Dalai Lama was appealing to foreign countries for refuge and aid. The actors of the film were good portrayals, especially both of the young and middle-age Kundun. The only bad portrayal was of Mao Zedong. The actor didn't really resemble him well and his acting as Chairman Mao had gone overboard. The entire movie revolved mostly around the Chinese Communist Party claiming Tibet and forcing the Dalai Lama out, instead it should focus more on the Dalai Lama's spiritual journey at the same time. The theme of government against religion is significant in today's ever changing society and I believe it was well filmed. There should be a balance of Dalai Lama's religious influence yet at the same time showing his history. The film had it's good points especially the fascinating process of finding Kundun and how he dealt with other people. This film is more suited to those who enjoy a great historical depiction of a man who went on a religious journey influenced by politics of the Chinese Communist Party. The also had brilliant scenery. This is definitely one of Martin Scorsese's best films so far.

    Martin Scorsese recounts the official version of the Dalai Lama's biography from his birth until the onset of his exile in India in 1959. In stunning images. That's it. And that's not enough. None of Marty's extraordinary narrative style is apparent here (although the movie is a showcase for cameraman Roger Deakins, who has since become the cinematographer of choice for the Coen brothers). Since the Dalai Lama is a real, and really ambivalent, political as well as religious figure, offering up a glossy 2-hours commercial on him simply isn't enough. The most egregious example of the movie's intentional superficiality is when the deposed Tibetan regent Reting Rinpoche perishes in the dungeons of the Potala palace and the Dalai Lama reacts to this by ... erm, performing a noble blessing gesture and then doing feck all. Was he in on it himself, or at least aware that there was a conspiracy, which he chose to ignore? But for what reasons? This movie won't tell you. It just wallows on in beautiful images.

    OK. Lately I've watched nothing but horror movies and silly comedies so I thought I would broaden my horizons somewhat and grab a more serious film and perhaps try to learn something for a change. I've now done that and can't say I feel that appreciably better for the experience. It must be a pretty weird feeling for a 2 or 3 year old kid to be told he is to run a country, and one that I might never experience - given I am nearer 40. The problem with Kundun is the subject matter. The movie concerns the discovery and life of the 14th (and current) Dalai Lama, and of course there is a fair amount of time focusing on the Chinese invasion and occupation of Tibet. Now I am not saying this isn't a worthwhile and amazing life, only that most people with a 7th grade education know this already, and unlike say "Saving Private Ryan", where we know the story but go for the ride because of the action, there just isn't much action to be found in Kundun. We meet the 14th Dalai Lama when his folks still call him his given name, which I don't remember hearing. Once he is chosen, he is immediately taken from his parents for training over the ensuing years to be the spiritual leader of Tibet. Being a pre-pubescent leader of a nation has its disadvantages believe it or not, at one point the young Dalai Lama is being briefed on the less than friendly intentions of neighbouring China, being reasonably practical he asks: "How many soldiers (does Tibet have)?" "5,000" "So many! That's a lot, well we are safe here." Of course then China decides that when you are a billion strong "No" doesn't necessarily mean "No", they invade and commence an occupation of Tibet. They attempt to influence the people and grease the wheels through manipulating the Dalai Lama - who initially fled for his safety, only to return to face the music and be a figurehead to his people. According to the film the discussions and dealings between the Chinese and the Dalai Lama were cordial and mostly above board, again in reality history has not been so kind to the Chinese where the dealings with the Tibetan people are concerned. I am amazed with the access that the Chinese people had that they never killed him, regardless of the backlash from a people that already resented their presence. As we all now know the Dalai Lama is one of the most revered pacifists on the planet, and unfortunately relations between Tibet and China are still frosty at best. Throughout the entire period of exile - which now spans many decades - he has maintained that China must leave Tibet but has never suggested violence or aggressive action of any kind. His teachings are followed (more than) fervently by millions and in reality the world would be a far better place if even more people lived a little more like him. But I am not discussing his life or existence, merely Martin Scorscese's representation of it, and unfortunately while it is a worthwhile story that deserves telling, if you are aware of the basics it doesn't bring much more to the table than a Movie of the Week. Final Rating for the Dalai Lama  10 / 10. Great bloke. We should all try to be more like him in our daily lives. Final Rating  7 / 10. If you don't know the basics of the 14th Dalai Lama's life, watch it for the information. If you do it doesn't bring much more to the table.

    This is quite a long movie, as most historical type movies tend to be. Kundun clearly has meaning for the Darli Lama and I have watched this movie for first time thirteen years after its original release, a filler in summer 2010 when there are no more good movies to watch at the moment. Watched it with my 12 year old son who turned to the net afterwards to check information about the Dar ly Lama and Tibet and also the Chinese invasion of Tibet. It is a beautiful film and the story is well told, if a little slow and tedious at times. this is in a different category of film making for Martin Scorsese and this will for me stay in the memory. A film for all ages, nothing graphically or verbally uncomfortable about this movie, it does the job of entertaining me one Sunday afternoon!

    I excepted a lot from this movie, and it did deliver. There is some great Buddhist wisdom in this movie. The real Dalai Lama is a very interesting person, and I think there is a lot of wisdom in Buddhism. The music, of course, sounds like Koyanisquatsi because it is by Philip Glass. This adds to the beauty of the movie. Whereas other biographies of famous people tend to get very poor this movie always stays focused and gives a good and honest portrayal of the Dalai Lama. All things being equal, it is a great movie, and I really enjoyed it. It is not like Taxi Driver of course but as a biography of a famous person it is really a great film indeed.

    The tale of the 14th Dalai Lama is very much like the story of the Last Emperor of China, Pu Yi. A boy handpicked to be a ruler of a country, grown up within confined solitude, kicked out of reign from Communist China, and then labeled as a criminal. The only real significance is that Pu Yi faced years in a concentration camp while the Dalai Lama managed to escape to India. That aside, it is not surprising to find in Scorsese's "Kundun" that he was heavily inspired by Bernardo Bertolucci's epic film "The Last Emperor". There were times when I was watching "Kundun" that I could not help wonder if this was an unofficial sequel. The costumes, techniques of candle lit lighting at night, story arc, and overall biography character-type was similar. I am not claiming Scorsese a copycat at all. It's just these two films are so alike. Just one happens to be about China's ruler and the other Tibet's. What worked so well for "The Last Emperor" is that despite its fancy set pieces and costumes, Bertolucci punched good in character drama and an overall intriguing plot. "Kundun" lacks both of these. Each scene in this movie drifts from one part of the Dalai Lama's life to another chronologically and in a sort of schizophrenic nature-the movie itself does not seem to know what it is really about. This is the biggest danger a filmmaker can fall into in making a bio-pic film, trying to cover too much ground without enough time nor interest to piece it all together. The acting suffers not from bad actors, but bad writing. Every moment is devoid of emotion, depicting every Tibetan character in a careless monotone. Then again, most characters are Buddhist monks and emotion is not their strong point. When I watch a movie, however, I expect to be engaged by an actor's talent. This magic is lost in this movie. "Kundun" does succeed at least in the technical aspects. Roger Deakins cinematography is stunning to watch and almost pushes the barrier on what can be done with a camera, whether it be an elaborate steadi-cam shot or a detailed close-up. Philip Glass's score creates a sort of mood that hints to an ethereal supernaturalism, combined with a brooding choir, a lush percussion, and bombastic brass. It supports the visual images nicely. I admit that it seems to take over the movie to the point that there is no other sound present, especially with the horn blasts of flatulence caliber. The one factor that presented mild interest for me was how fair Scorsese treated the Tibetan culture. Little nuances like the funeral rites, the teachings of Buddha, and the Dalai Lama's philosophy are interesting. Yet great cinematography, a sublime soundtrack, and a good treatment of a lost culture cannot save a film. It is a bit disheartening since Scorsese has made some very good movies outside of the gangster genre (ex: Hugo, Shutter Island). While he kept his visuals and artsy elements at full throttle, all other elements are at a loss. This kind of movie is clearly not his cup of tea.

    Kundun is a movie about the search for the Dalai Llama. In the beginning, a monk comes to search for the next Dalai Llama. He finds a young boy named Lhamo, who initially seems like a very self-centered, short-tempered child. However, the monks give Lhamo a test by placing a series of objects in front of him, to see if he will chose the objects that belonged to the preceding Dalai Llama. Then, upon passing the test, Lhamo is taken to the monastery where he begins to grow up and mature. He meets Regent Reting Rinpoche, who was the man that discovered Lhamo's existence through a vision he had while sleeping. However, the Chinese Communists imprison and kill Regent Reting Rinpoche, and Lhamo meets with Chairman Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong expresses to Lhamo that "religion is poison", and they are never able to settle on any agreements. Lhamo, upon being pursued by the Chinese, flees to the Indian Mountains. At a mountain border crossing, an Indian guard asks Lhamo if he is the Lord Buddha, and Lhamo replies, "I think that I am a reflection, like the moon on water. When you see me, and I try to be a good man, you see yourself." Personally, one of my favorite parts about the movie was the scene where Lhamo is picking up the objects that are placed in front of him by the monks. It's a very exciting scene, as Lhamo initially gives off the impression that he is a very spoiled child, and it's hard to imagine that he will chose the correct objects and eventually train to become the Dalai Llama. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a particular interest in the process of discovering the next Dalai Llama, and is interested in the political aspect and implications of being the leader of a religious group.

    I saw the movie "Kundun" recently, directed by Martin Scorsese. This movie was somewhat reminiscent to that of "The Last Emperor" (the movie depicting the life of Puyi). But rather, takes on more of a religious perspective, showing the life of the 14th Dalai Lama. The movie was set in a beautiful location, with magnificent views of the Tibetan mountainous region. The music really went well with the visuals. It didn't draw attention nor did it put me to sleep. The graphics and setting of the film was spectacular and one of the best. I especially liked the scene when Kundun was washing away the sand mandala. The costumes of the Buddhist monks were very well detailed and interesting. I enjoyed the serenity of the backdrop, which really gave a relaxing feel to the film. I felt that this movie left out a lot of significant parts of the the Dalai Lama. They left out how his life after his exile, which I think is important as to the development of him today. It should include scenes where the Dalai Lama was appealing to foreign countries for refuge and aid. The actors of the film were good portrayals, especially both of the young and middle-age Kundun. The only bad portrayal was of Mao Zedong. The actor didn't really resemble him well and his acting as Chairman Mao had gone overboard. The entire movie revolved mostly around the Chinese Communist Party claiming Tibet and forcing the Dalai Lama out, instead it should focus more on the Dalai Lama's spiritual journey at the same time. The theme of government against religion is significant in today's ever changing society and I believe it was well filmed. There should be a balance of Dalai Lama's religious influence yet at the same time showing his history. The film had it's good points especially the fascinating process of finding Kundun and how he dealt with other people. This film is more suited to those who enjoy a great historical depiction of a man who went on a religious journey influenced by politics of the Chinese Communist Party. The also had brilliant scenery. This is definitely one of Martin Scorsese's best films so far.

    I think I am well versed in Buddhism to say that, contrary to the majority opinion, this is a superficial smattering of a wonderful practice. I don't know whose fault it is, certainly Scorsese's though he is an outsider so that is sort of to be expected. I suspect the Dalai Lama's circle were fine with a superficially romantic portrayal, so long as it generates awareness for their just cause. Why do I say this? The main narrative device that gives this any sort of shape (otherwise it is one long picture-pretty rambling), is the DL meditating in exile, possibly at that balcony at the Indian border, possibly at a much later time. This would be in line with the recurring motifs of prescient visions and the spyglass (looking from a distance) which is first introduced right after the screening of a silent film (the association is with memory, illusions and time gone - all things to purify the mind from in meditation). This would somewhat excuse the fragmentary nature of the narrative and quaint focus of it on young boy versus evil empire of millions, since it was all experienced from his end. Somewhat. It is still absolutely tepid as a historic film if we switch to the 'objective' pov. Now, this last segment of the crossing to India is accompanied by the one powerful visual meditation in the film, it is not mentioned but what you see is the Kalachakra initiation with the Great Sand Mandala being constructed and brushed away, a powerful and sacred occasion. Get it? This is it, this one moment. The DL is heartbroken and his courage waning, and lost in meditation, he finds peace in reminding himself of the transience of all things, which is what the ritual represents and a core Buddhist precept, the cosmos being washed away back into river-sand. The entire rest of the film is a pageant; oracles hiss, rituals go on, dances, ornate ceremonies, hushed whispers of banality. Scorsese mistakes here the theater of appearances (the religion) for the essence. He films the ritual as the thing-in-itself, as spectacle, instead of as the space that allows you to cultivate a compassionate mind. The postcard instead of the real spiritual landscape. How rich this would be if, for instance, we had contrasts between flows of remembered ordinary life and abstractions in three- and twodimensional space in the dances and mandala, and all of that (all the costumes, the ceremonies, the symbols and human suffering) understood as different sides of one image -empty- brushed away as the mind heals itself. I am in awe of the possibilities! No dice. Scorsese films operatic platitudes. Skip this if you want to know Buddhism. Go straight for Why Did Bodhidharma Left for the East? or even Herzog's Buddhist doc, which he also filmed around the Kalachakra. Blowup, if you want deep, incidentally Buddhist essaying on the roots of suffering.

    Probably the foremost reason why most people are disappointed with this movie is because it's a Martin Scorsese movie, without anything about it that screams out Martin Scorsese. It probably was simply a subject he had a real interest and love for, which blinded him it seems. Sure, it focuses on its main subject but everything surrounding it gets completely ignored it seemed, which made this movie mostly a disappointing watch. Don't go watch this movie expecting to learn everything about Tibet, Buddhism or the Dalai Lama. Seriously, after watching this movie I don't feel like I have learned anything. It doesn't explain anything about the religion and rituals, or tells you what the Dalai Lama is all about and what he stands for. It actually made this a very shallow movie experience, which I never could feel involved with. The only way I could see this movie being interesting, is if you are already into the subject and have some basic knowledge about it. For a movie with a subject such as this one has, it's surprisingly lacking depth. You would expect the movie to be filled with ancient wisdoms concerning spirituality, knowledge and peace. Absolutely none of that present in this movie. It simply follows its main subject around and that's it really. Evertyhing that happens around him and every story aspects that potentially could had been interesting gets handled poorly and all remains very underdeveloped. Another thing that felt wrong about this movie was its acting. The movie uses non-professionals of Tibetan descent, forced to speak English. If first of all feels wrong to hear them all speak English but next to that, the acting itself from most of the actors is far from anything too impressive. No, it's not like I hated this movie. After all, it remains perfectly watchable but it never got interesting or involving enough in any way. What saves it is that it's still a technically well made movie, that is great looking as well. Most people will praise the cinematographer or director for this but in some cases, such as this one, you should simply give most credit the natural environments. I mean, I don't think it was possible for the film-makers to let this movie look ugly, even if they tried really hard to do so. Too distant and shallow to call this a great or recommendable movie. 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Kundun is legendary film director Martin Scorsese's follow-up to his 1995 masterpiece, Casino. I watched this considering how much I love Martin Scorsese, and when I watched it, I was astounded! Kundun is outstanding from start to finish, it is absolutely dazzling and astonishing! By the way, Kundun is about this: from childhood until adulthood, Tibet's 14th dalai lama deals with Chinese oppression and other problems. Before I continue, let my say something. Why did I like this movie? I liked it for a number of reasons. I did not like it just because it is directed by my all time favorite film director, Martin Scorsese, I liked it for other reasons, such as the acting, the scenery, and especially, the costumes. The costumes in this movie were stupendous, the person who designed them should have been at least nominated for the Academy Award For Best Costume Design, or possibly even won. Kundun scores another great movie for Martin Scorsese, it is big proof of his fabulous talent at directing movies! When I watched this movie, I decided to think of it not as a Martin Scorsese movie, but as a movie, and when it was over, I simply was blown away! It is really interesting that the same man who directed classics like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Casino, and Raging Bull would direct such a great movie like this! But this was not the end for good ol' Martin Scorsese, he would eventually direct Gangs Of New York in 2002, The Avaitor in 2004, and not to mention, The Departed in 2006, which brought him the Academy Award for Best Director. But getting back to Kundun, he has once again managed to astonish us with his fabulous directing talents! It is really amazing that even as Scorsese gets old, he hasn't lost his touch at directing, one of the few other directors besides him who was like that is Sidney Lumet, proved that with his last film, Before The Devil Knows You're Dead. Kundun is absolutely superb, it has results that must be seen in order to be believed. If you haven't seen this movie, then watch it. Why? Because it's excellent, it is one of the best films of 1997. Scorsese is also good at telling a story. When he tells a story, the story grabs hold of you and it holds on until the very minute that the end credits begin to roll, yes, it really is that compelling, it simply won't let go of you until the end of a movie. This happened to me in quite a few Scorsese films, such as Goodfellas, The Departed, Casino, and the very film I talking about right now, Kundun. Allow Martin Scorsese to once again show that he is one of the greatest film directors ever made when you watch Kundun, because when you watch it, you will be thrilled by what you will see. Trust me, when you watch this film, you will see what I mean when I say that this film is great, because it is great! 10/10

Philip Glass's score creates a sort of mood that hints to an ethereal supernaturalism, combined with a brooding choir, a lush percussion, and bombastic brass. It supports the visual images nicely. I admit that it seems to take over the movie to the point that there is no other sound present, especially with the horn blasts of flatulence caliber. The one factor that presented mild interest for me was how fair Scorsese treated the Tibetan culture. Little nuances like the funeral rites, the teachings of Buddha, and the Dalai Lama's philosophy are interesting. Yet great cinematography, a sublime soundtrack, and a good treatment of a lost culture cannot save a film. It is a bit disheartening since Scorsese has made some very good movies outside of the gangster genre (ex: Hugo, Shutter Island). While he kept his visuals and artsy elements at full throttle, all other elements are at a loss. This kind of movie is clearly not his cup of tea.

    Kundun is a movie about the search for the Dalai Llama. In the beginning, a monk comes to search for the next Dalai Llama. He finds a young boy named Lhamo, who initially seems like a very self-centered, short-tempered child. However, the monks give Lhamo a test by placing a series of objects in front of him, to see if he will chose the objects that belonged to the preceding Dalai Llama. Then, upon passing the test, Lhamo is taken to the monastery where he begins to grow up and mature. He meets Regent Reting Rinpoche, who was the man that discovered Lhamo's existence through a vision he had while sleeping. However, the Chinese Communists imprison and kill Regent Reting Rinpoche, and Lhamo meets with Chairman Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong expresses to Lhamo that "religion is poison", and they are never able to settle on any agreements. Lhamo, upon being pursued by the Chinese, flees to the Indian Mountains. At a mountain border crossing, an Indian guard asks Lhamo if he is the Lord Buddha, and Lhamo replies, "I think that I am a reflection, like the moon on water. When you see me, and I try to be a good man, you see yourself." Personally, one of my favorite parts about the movie was the scene where Lhamo is picking up the objects that are placed in front of him by the monks. It's a very exciting scene, as Lhamo initially gives off the impression that he is a very spoiled child, and it's hard to imagine that he will chose the correct objects and eventually train to become the Dalai Llama. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a particular interest in the process of discovering the next Dalai Llama, and is interested in the political aspect and implications of being the leader of a religious group.

    I saw the movie "Kundun" recently, directed by Martin Scorsese. This movie was somewhat reminiscent to that of "The Last Emperor" (the movie depicting the life of Puyi). But rather, takes on more of a religious perspective, showing the life of the 14th Dalai Lama. The movie was set in a beautiful location, with magnificent views of the Tibetan mountainous region. The music really went well with the visuals. It didn't draw attention nor did it put me to sleep. The graphics and setting of the film was spectacular and one of the best. I especially liked the scene when Kundun was washing away the sand mandala. The costumes of the Buddhist monks were very well detailed and interesting. I enjoyed the serenity of the backdrop, which really gave a relaxing feel to the film. I felt that this movie left out a lot of significant parts of the the Dalai Lama. They left out how his life after his exile, which I think is important as to the development of him today. It should include scenes where the Dalai Lama was appealing to foreign countries for refuge and aid. The actors of the film were good portrayals, especially both of the young and middle-age Kundun. The only bad portrayal was of Mao Zedong. The actor didn't really resemble him well and his acting as Chairman Mao had gone overboard. The entire movie revolved mostly around the Chinese Communist Party claiming Tibet and forcing the Dalai Lama out, instead it should focus more on the Dalai Lama's spiritual journey at the same time. The theme of government against religion is significant in today's ever changing society and I believe it was well filmed. There should be a balance of Dalai Lama's religious influence yet at the same time showing his history. The film had it's good points especially the fascinating process of finding Kundun and how he dealt with other people. This film is more suited to those who enjoy a great historical depiction of a man who went on a religious journey influenced by politics of the Chinese Communist Party. The also had brilliant scenery. This is definitely one of Martin Scorsese's best films so far.

    I think I am well versed in Buddhism to say that, contrary to the majority opinion, this is a superficial smattering of a wonderful practice. I don't know whose fault it is, certainly Scorsese's though he is an outsider so that is sort of to be expected. I suspect the Dalai Lama's circle were fine with a superficially romantic portrayal, so long as it generates awareness for their just cause. Why do I say this? The main narrative device that gives this any sort of shape (otherwise it is one long picture-pretty rambling), is the DL meditating in exile, possibly at that balcony at the Indian border, possibly at a much later time. This would be in line with the recurring motifs of prescient visions and the spyglass (looking from a distance) which is first introduced right after the screening of a silent film (the association is with memory, illusions and time gone - all things to purify the mind from in meditation). This would somewhat excuse the fragmentary nature of the narrative and quaint focus of it on young boy versus evil empire of millions, since it was all experienced from his end. Somewhat. It is still absolutely tepid as a historic film if we switch to the 'objective' pov. Now, this last segment of the crossing to India is accompanied by the one powerful visual meditation in the film, it is not mentioned but what you see is the Kalachakra initiation with the Great Sand Mandala being constructed and brushed away, a powerful and sacred occasion. Get it? This is it, this one moment. The DL is heartbroken and his courage waning, and lost in meditation, he finds peace in reminding himself of the transience of all things, which is what the ritual represents and a core Buddhist precept, the cosmos being washed away back into river-sand. The entire rest of the film is a pageant; oracles hiss, rituals go on, dances, ornate ceremonies, hushed whispers of banality. Scorsese mistakes here the theater of appearances (the religion) for the essence. He films the ritual as the thing-in-itself, as spectacle, instead of as the space that allows you to cultivate a compassionate mind. The postcard instead of the real spiritual landscape. How rich this would be if, for instance, we had contrasts between flows of remembered ordinary life and abstractions in three- and twodimensional space in the dances and mandala, and all of that (all the costumes, the ceremonies, the symbols and human suffering) understood as different sides of one image -empty- brushed away as the mind heals itself. I am in awe of the possibilities! No dice. Scorsese films operatic platitudes. Skip this if you want to know Buddhism. Go straight for Why Did Bodhidharma Left for the East? or even Herzog's Buddhist doc, which he also filmed around the Kalachakra. Blowup, if you want deep, incidentally Buddhist essaying on the roots of suffering.

    Probably the foremost reason why most people are disappointed with this movie is because it's a Martin Scorsese movie, without anything about it that screams out Martin Scorsese. It probably was simply a subject he had a real interest and love for, which blinded him it seems. Sure, it focuses on its main subject but everything surrounding it gets completely ignored it seemed, which made this movie mostly a disappointing watch. Don't go watch this movie expecting to learn everything about Tibet, Buddhism or the Dalai Lama. Seriously, after watching this movie I don't feel like I have learned anything. It doesn't explain anything about the religion and rituals, or tells you what the Dalai Lama is all about and what he stands for. It actually made this a very shallow movie experience, which I never could feel involved with. The only way I could see this movie being interesting, is if you are already into the subject and have some basic knowledge about it. For a movie with a subject such as this one has, it's surprisingly lacking depth. You would expect the movie to be filled with ancient wisdoms concerning spirituality, knowledge and peace. Absolutely none of that present in this movie. It simply follows its main subject around and that's it really. Evertyhing that happens around him and every story aspects that potentially could had been interesting gets handled poorly and all remains very underdeveloped. Another thing that felt wrong about this movie was its acting. The movie uses non-professionals of Tibetan descent, forced to speak English. If first of all feels wrong to hear them all speak English but next to that, the acting itself from most of the actors is far from anything too impressive. No, it's not like I hated this movie. After all, it remains perfectly watchable but it never got interesting or involving enough in any way. What saves it is that it's still a technically well made movie, that is great looking as well. Most people will praise the cinematographer or director for this but in some cases, such as this one, you should simply give most credit the natural environments. I mean, I don't think it was possible for the film-makers to let this movie look ugly, even if they tried really hard to do so. Too distant and shallow to call this a great or recommendable movie. 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Kundun is legendary film director Martin Scorsese's follow-up to his 1995 masterpiece, Casino. I watched this considering how much I love Martin Scorsese, and when I watched it, I was astounded! Kundun is outstanding from start to finish, it is absolutely dazzling and astonishing! By the way, Kundun is about this: from childhood until adulthood, Tibet's 14th dalai lama deals with Chinese oppression and other problems. Before I continue, let my say something. Why did I like this movie? I liked it for a number of reasons. I did not like it just because it is directed by my all time favorite film director, Martin Scorsese, I liked it for other reasons, such as the acting, the scenery, and especially, the costumes. The costumes in this movie were stupendous, the person who designed them should have been at least nominated for the Academy Award For Best Costume Design, or possibly even won. Kundun scores another great movie for Martin Scorsese, it is big proof of his fabulous talent at directing movies! When I watched this movie, I decided to think of it not as a Martin Scorsese movie, but as a movie, and when it was over, I simply was blown away! It is really interesting that the same man who directed classics like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Casino, and Raging Bull would direct such a great movie like this! But this was not the end for good ol' Martin Scorsese, he would eventually direct Gangs Of New York in 2002, The Avaitor in 2004, and not to mention, The Departed in 2006, which brought him the Academy Award for Best Director. But getting back to Kundun, he has once again managed to astonish us with his fabulous directing talents! It is really amazing that even as Scorsese gets old, he hasn't lost his touch at directing, one of the few other directors besides him who was like that is Sidney Lumet, proved that with his last film, Before The Devil Knows You're Dead. Kundun is absolutely superb, it has results that must be seen in order to be believed. If you haven't seen this movie, then watch it. Why? Because it's excellent, it is one of the best films of 1997. Scorsese is also good at telling a story. When he tells a story, the story grabs hold of you and it holds on until the very minute that the end credits begin to roll, yes, it really is that compelling, it simply won't let go of you until the end of a movie. This happened to me in quite a few Scorsese films, such as Goodfellas, The Departed, Casino, and the very film I talking about right now, Kundun. Allow Martin Scorsese to once again show that he is one of the greatest film directors ever made when you watch Kundun, because when you watch it, you will be thrilled by what you will see. Trust me, when you watch this film, you will see what I mean when I say that this film is great, because it is great! 10/10

    Martin Scorsese recounts the official version of the Dalai Lama's biography from his birth until the onset of his exile in India in 1959. In stunning images. That's it. And that's not enough. None of Marty's extraordinary narrative style is apparent here (although the movie is a showcase for cameraman Roger Deakins, who has since become the cinematographer of choice for the Coen brothers). Since the Dalai Lama is a real, and really ambivalent, political as well as religious figure, offering up a glossy 2-hours commercial on him simply isn't enough. The most egregious example of the movie's intentional superficiality is when the deposed Tibetan regent Reting Rinpoche perishes in the dungeons of the Potala palace and the Dalai Lama reacts to this by ... erm, performing a noble blessing gesture and then doing feck all. Was he in on it himself, or at least aware that there was a conspiracy, which he chose to ignore? But for what reasons? This movie won't tell you. It just wallows on in beautiful images.

    OK. Lately I've watched nothing but horror movies and silly comedies so I thought I would broaden my horizons somewhat and grab a more serious film and perhaps try to learn something for a change. I've now done that and can't say I feel that appreciably better for the experience. It must be a pretty weird feeling for a 2 or 3 year old kid to be told he is to run a country, and one that I might never experience - given I am nearer 40. The problem with Kundun is the subject matter. The movie concerns the discovery and life of the 14th (and current) Dalai Lama, and of course there is a fair amount of time focusing on the Chinese invasion and occupation of Tibet. Now I am not saying this isn't a worthwhile and amazing life, only that most people with a 7th grade education know this already, and unlike say "Saving Private Ryan", where we know the story but go for the ride because of the action, there just isn't much action to be found in Kundun. We meet the 14th Dalai Lama when his folks still call him his given name, which I don't remember hearing. Once he is chosen, he is immediately taken from his parents for training over the ensuing years to be the spiritual leader of Tibet. Being a pre-pubescent leader of a nation has its disadvantages believe it or not, at one point the young Dalai Lama is being briefed on the less than friendly intentions of neighbouring China, being reasonably practical he asks: "How many soldiers (does Tibet have)?" "5,000" "So many! That's a lot, well we are safe here." Of course then China decides that when you are a billion strong "No" doesn't necessarily mean "No", they invade and commence an occupation of Tibet. They attempt to influence the people and grease the wheels through manipulating the Dalai Lama - who initially fled for his safety, only to return to face the music and be a figurehead to his people. According to the film the discussions and dealings between the Chinese and the Dalai Lama were cordial and mostly above board, again in reality history has not been so kind to the Chinese where the dealings with the Tibetan people are concerned. I am amazed with the access that the Chinese people had that they never killed him, regardless of the backlash from a people that already resented their presence. As we all now know the Dalai Lama is one of the most revered pacifists on the planet, and unfortunately relations between Tibet and China are still frosty at best. Throughout the entire period of exile - which now spans many decades - he has maintained that China must leave Tibet but has never suggested violence or aggressive action of any kind. His teachings are followed (more than) fervently by millions and in reality the world would be a far better place if even more people lived a little more like him. But I am not discussing his life or existence, merely Martin Scorscese's representation of it, and unfortunately while it is a worthwhile story that deserves telling, if you are aware of the basics it doesn't bring much more to the table than a Movie of the Week. Final Rating for the Dalai Lama  10 / 10. Great bloke. We should all try to be more like him in our daily lives. Final Rating  7 / 10. If you don't know the basics of the 14th Dalai Lama's life, watch it for the information. If you do it doesn't bring much more to the table.

    This is quite a long movie, as most historical type movies tend to be. Kundun clearly has meaning for the Darli Lama and I have watched this movie for first time thirteen years after its original release, a filler in summer 2010 when there are no more good movies to watch at the moment. Watched it with my 12 year old son who turned to the net afterwards to check information about the Dar ly Lama and Tibet and also the Chinese invasion of Tibet. It is a beautiful film and the story is well told, if a little slow and tedious at times. this is in a different category of film making for Martin Scorsese and this will for me stay in the memory. A film for all ages, nothing graphically or verbally uncomfortable about this movie, it does the job of entertaining me one Sunday afternoon!

    I excepted a lot from this movie, and it did deliver. There is some great Buddhist wisdom in this movie. The real Dalai Lama is a very interesting person, and I think there is a lot of wisdom in Buddhism. The music, of course, sounds like Koyanisquatsi because it is by Philip Glass. This adds to the beauty of the movie. Whereas other biographies of famous people tend to get very poor this movie always stays focused and gives a good and honest portrayal of the Dalai Lama. All things being equal, it is a great movie, and I really enjoyed it. It is not like Taxi Driver of course but as a biography of a famous person it is really a great film indeed.

    The tale of the 14th Dalai Lama is very much like the story of the Last Emperor of China, Pu Yi. A boy handpicked to be a ruler of a country, grown up within confined solitude, kicked out of reign from Communist China, and then labeled as a criminal. The only real significance is that Pu Yi faced years in a concentration camp while the Dalai Lama managed to escape to India. That aside, it is not surprising to find in Scorsese's "Kundun" that he was heavily inspired by Bernardo Bertolucci's epic film "The Last Emperor". There were times when I was watching "Kundun" that I could not help wonder if this was an unofficial sequel. The costumes, techniques of candle lit lighting at night, story arc, and overall biography character-type was similar. I am not claiming Scorsese a copycat at all. It's just these two films are so alike. Just one happens to be about China's ruler and the other Tibet's. What worked so well for "The Last Emperor" is that despite its fancy set pieces and costumes, Bertolucci punched good in character drama and an overall intriguing plot. "Kundun" lacks both of these. Each scene in this movie drifts from one part of the Dalai Lama's life to another chronologically and in a sort of schizophrenic nature-the movie itself does not seem to know what it is really about. This is the biggest danger a filmmaker can fall into in making a bio-pic film, trying to cover too much ground without enough time nor interest to piece it all together. The acting suffers not from bad actors, but bad writing. Every moment is devoid of emotion, depicting every Tibetan character in a careless monotone. Then again, most characters are Buddhist monks and emotion is not their strong point. When I watch a movie, however, I expect to be engaged by an actor's talent. This magic is lost in this movie. "Kundun" does succeed at least in the technical aspects. Roger Deakins cinematography is stunning to watch and almost pushes the barrier on what can be done with a camera, whether it be an elaborate steadi-cam shot or a detailed close-up. Philip Glass's score creates a sort of mood that hints to an ethereal supernaturalism, combined with a brooding choir, a lush percussion, and bombastic brass. It supports the visual images nicely. I admit that it seems to take over the movie to the point that there is no other sound present, especially with the horn blasts of flatulence caliber. The one factor that presented mild interest for me was how fair Scorsese treated the Tibetan culture. Little nuances like the funeral rites, the teachings of Buddha, and the Dalai Lama's philosophy are interesting. Yet great cinematography, a sublime soundtrack, and a good treatment of a lost culture cannot save a film. It is a bit disheartening since Scorsese has made some very good movies outside of the gangster genre (ex: Hugo, Shutter Island). While he kept his visuals and artsy elements at full throttle, all other elements are at a loss. This kind of movie is clearly not his cup of tea.

It actually made this a very shallow movie experience, which I never could feel involved with. The only way I could see this movie being interesting, is if you are already into the subject and have some basic knowledge about it. For a movie with a subject such as this one has, it's surprisingly lacking depth. You would expect the movie to be filled with ancient wisdoms concerning spirituality, knowledge and peace. Absolutely none of that present in this movie. It simply follows its main subject around and that's it really. Evertyhing that happens around him and every story aspects that potentially could had been interesting gets handled poorly and all remains very underdeveloped. Another thing that felt wrong about this movie was its acting. The movie uses non-professionals of Tibetan descent, forced to speak English. If first of all feels wrong to hear them all speak English but next to that, the acting itself from most of the actors is far from anything too impressive. No, it's not like I hated this movie. After all, it remains perfectly watchable but it never got interesting or involving enough in any way. What saves it is that it's still a technically well made movie, that is great looking as well. Most people will praise the cinematographer or director for this but in some cases, such as this one, you should simply give most credit the natural environments. I mean, I don't think it was possible for the film-makers to let this movie look ugly, even if they tried really hard to do so. Too distant and shallow to call this a great or recommendable movie. 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Kundun is legendary film director Martin Scorsese's follow-up to his 1995 masterpiece, Casino. I watched this considering how much I love Martin Scorsese, and when I watched it, I was astounded! Kundun is outstanding from start to finish, it is absolutely dazzling and astonishing! By the way, Kundun is about this: from childhood until adulthood, Tibet's 14th dalai lama deals with Chinese oppression and other problems. Before I continue, let my say something. Why did I like this movie? I liked it for a number of reasons. I did not like it just because it is directed by my all time favorite film director, Martin Scorsese, I liked it for other reasons, such as the acting, the scenery, and especially, the costumes. The costumes in this movie were stupendous, the person who designed them should have been at least nominated for the Academy Award For Best Costume Design, or possibly even won. Kundun scores another great movie for Martin Scorsese, it is big proof of his fabulous talent at directing movies! When I watched this movie, I decided to think of it not as a Martin Scorsese movie, but as a movie, and when it was over, I simply was blown away! It is really interesting that the same man who directed classics like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Casino, and Raging Bull would direct such a great movie like this! But this was not the end for good ol' Martin Scorsese, he would eventually direct Gangs Of New York in 2002, The Avaitor in 2004, and not to mention, The Departed in 2006, which brought him the Academy Award for Best Director. But getting back to Kundun, he has once again managed to astonish us with his fabulous directing talents! It is really amazing that even as Scorsese gets old, he hasn't lost his touch at directing, one of the few other directors besides him who was like that is Sidney Lumet, proved that with his last film, Before The Devil Knows You're Dead. Kundun is absolutely superb, it has results that must be seen in order to be believed. If you haven't seen this movie, then watch it. Why? Because it's excellent, it is one of the best films of 1997. Scorsese is also good at telling a story. When he tells a story, the story grabs hold of you and it holds on until the very minute that the end credits begin to roll, yes, it really is that compelling, it simply won't let go of you until the end of a movie. This happened to me in quite a few Scorsese films, such as Goodfellas, The Departed, Casino, and the very film I talking about right now, Kundun. Allow Martin Scorsese to once again show that he is one of the greatest film directors ever made when you watch Kundun, because when you watch it, you will be thrilled by what you will see. Trust me, when you watch this film, you will see what I mean when I say that this film is great, because it is great! 10/10

    Martin Scorsese recounts the official version of the Dalai Lama's biography from his birth until the onset of his exile in India in 1959. In stunning images. That's it. And that's not enough. None of Marty's extraordinary narrative style is apparent here (although the movie is a showcase for cameraman Roger Deakins, who has since become the cinematographer of choice for the Coen brothers). Since the Dalai Lama is a real, and really ambivalent, political as well as religious figure, offering up a glossy 2-hours commercial on him simply isn't enough. The most egregious example of the movie's intentional superficiality is when the deposed Tibetan regent Reting Rinpoche perishes in the dungeons of the Potala palace and the Dalai Lama reacts to this by ... erm, performing a noble blessing gesture and then doing feck all. Was he in on it himself, or at least aware that there was a conspiracy, which he chose to ignore? But for what reasons? This movie won't tell you. It just wallows on in beautiful images.

    OK. Lately I've watched nothing but horror movies and silly comedies so I thought I would broaden my horizons somewhat and grab a more serious film and perhaps try to learn something for a change. I've now done that and can't say I feel that appreciably better for the experience. It must be a pretty weird feeling for a 2 or 3 year old kid to be told he is to run a country, and one that I might never experience - given I am nearer 40. The problem with Kundun is the subject matter. The movie concerns the discovery and life of the 14th (and current) Dalai Lama, and of course there is a fair amount of time focusing on the Chinese invasion and occupation of Tibet. Now I am not saying this isn't a worthwhile and amazing life, only that most people with a 7th grade education know this already, and unlike say "Saving Private Ryan", where we know the story but go for the ride because of the action, there just isn't much action to be found in Kundun. We meet the 14th Dalai Lama when his folks still call him his given name, which I don't remember hearing. Once he is chosen, he is immediately taken from his parents for training over the ensuing years to be the spiritual leader of Tibet. Being a pre-pubescent leader of a nation has its disadvantages believe it or not, at one point the young Dalai Lama is being briefed on the less than friendly intentions of neighbouring China, being reasonably practical he asks: "How many soldiers (does Tibet have)?" "5,000" "So many! That's a lot, well we are safe here." Of course then China decides that when you are a billion strong "No" doesn't necessarily mean "No", they invade and commence an occupation of Tibet. They attempt to influence the people and grease the wheels through manipulating the Dalai Lama - who initially fled for his safety, only to return to face the music and be a figurehead to his people. According to the film the discussions and dealings between the Chinese and the Dalai Lama were cordial and mostly above board, again in reality history has not been so kind to the Chinese where the dealings with the Tibetan people are concerned. I am amazed with the access that the Chinese people had that they never killed him, regardless of the backlash from a people that already resented their presence. As we all now know the Dalai Lama is one of the most revered pacifists on the planet, and unfortunately relations between Tibet and China are still frosty at best. Throughout the entire period of exile - which now spans many decades - he has maintained that China must leave Tibet but has never suggested violence or aggressive action of any kind. His teachings are followed (more than) fervently by millions and in reality the world would be a far better place if even more people lived a little more like him. But I am not discussing his life or existence, merely Martin Scorscese's representation of it, and unfortunately while it is a worthwhile story that deserves telling, if you are aware of the basics it doesn't bring much more to the table than a Movie of the Week. Final Rating for the Dalai Lama  10 / 10. Great bloke. We should all try to be more like him in our daily lives. Final Rating  7 / 10. If you don't know the basics of the 14th Dalai Lama's life, watch it for the information. If you do it doesn't bring much more to the table.

    This is quite a long movie, as most historical type movies tend to be. Kundun clearly has meaning for the Darli Lama and I have watched this movie for first time thirteen years after its original release, a filler in summer 2010 when there are no more good movies to watch at the moment. Watched it with my 12 year old son who turned to the net afterwards to check information about the Dar ly Lama and Tibet and also the Chinese invasion of Tibet. It is a beautiful film and the story is well told, if a little slow and tedious at times. this is in a different category of film making for Martin Scorsese and this will for me stay in the memory. A film for all ages, nothing graphically or verbally uncomfortable about this movie, it does the job of entertaining me one Sunday afternoon!

    I excepted a lot from this movie, and it did deliver. There is some great Buddhist wisdom in this movie. The real Dalai Lama is a very interesting person, and I think there is a lot of wisdom in Buddhism. The music, of course, sounds like Koyanisquatsi because it is by Philip Glass. This adds to the beauty of the movie. Whereas other biographies of famous people tend to get very poor this movie always stays focused and gives a good and honest portrayal of the Dalai Lama. All things being equal, it is a great movie, and I really enjoyed it. It is not like Taxi Driver of course but as a biography of a famous person it is really a great film indeed.

    The tale of the 14th Dalai Lama is very much like the story of the Last Emperor of China, Pu Yi. A boy handpicked to be a ruler of a country, grown up within confined solitude, kicked out of reign from Communist China, and then labeled as a criminal. The only real significance is that Pu Yi faced years in a concentration camp while the Dalai Lama managed to escape to India. That aside, it is not surprising to find in Scorsese's "Kundun" that he was heavily inspired by Bernardo Bertolucci's epic film "The Last Emperor". There were times when I was watching "Kundun" that I could not help wonder if this was an unofficial sequel. The costumes, techniques of candle lit lighting at night, story arc, and overall biography character-type was similar. I am not claiming Scorsese a copycat at all. It's just these two films are so alike. Just one happens to be about China's ruler and the other Tibet's. What worked so well for "The Last Emperor" is that despite its fancy set pieces and costumes, Bertolucci punched good in character drama and an overall intriguing plot. "Kundun" lacks both of these. Each scene in this movie drifts from one part of the Dalai Lama's life to another chronologically and in a sort of schizophrenic nature-the movie itself does not seem to know what it is really about. This is the biggest danger a filmmaker can fall into in making a bio-pic film, trying to cover too much ground without enough time nor interest to piece it all together. The acting suffers not from bad actors, but bad writing. Every moment is devoid of emotion, depicting every Tibetan character in a careless monotone. Then again, most characters are Buddhist monks and emotion is not their strong point. When I watch a movie, however, I expect to be engaged by an actor's talent. This magic is lost in this movie. "Kundun" does succeed at least in the technical aspects. Roger Deakins cinematography is stunning to watch and almost pushes the barrier on what can be done with a camera, whether it be an elaborate steadi-cam shot or a detailed close-up. Philip Glass's score creates a sort of mood that hints to an ethereal supernaturalism, combined with a brooding choir, a lush percussion, and bombastic brass. It supports the visual images nicely. I admit that it seems to take over the movie to the point that there is no other sound present, especially with the horn blasts of flatulence caliber. The one factor that presented mild interest for me was how fair Scorsese treated the Tibetan culture. Little nuances like the funeral rites, the teachings of Buddha, and the Dalai Lama's philosophy are interesting. Yet great cinematography, a sublime soundtrack, and a good treatment of a lost culture cannot save a film. It is a bit disheartening since Scorsese has made some very good movies outside of the gangster genre (ex: Hugo, Shutter Island). While he kept his visuals and artsy elements at full throttle, all other elements are at a loss. This kind of movie is clearly not his cup of tea.

    Kundun is a movie about the search for the Dalai Llama. In the beginning, a monk comes to search for the next Dalai Llama. He finds a young boy named Lhamo, who initially seems like a very self-centered, short-tempered child. However, the monks give Lhamo a test by placing a series of objects in front of him, to see if he will chose the objects that belonged to the preceding Dalai Llama. Then, upon passing the test, Lhamo is taken to the monastery where he begins to grow up and mature. He meets Regent Reting Rinpoche, who was the man that discovered Lhamo's existence through a vision he had while sleeping. However, the Chinese Communists imprison and kill Regent Reting Rinpoche, and Lhamo meets with Chairman Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong expresses to Lhamo that "religion is poison", and they are never able to settle on any agreements. Lhamo, upon being pursued by the Chinese, flees to the Indian Mountains. At a mountain border crossing, an Indian guard asks Lhamo if he is the Lord Buddha, and Lhamo replies, "I think that I am a reflection, like the moon on water. When you see me, and I try to be a good man, you see yourself." Personally, one of my favorite parts about the movie was the scene where Lhamo is picking up the objects that are placed in front of him by the monks. It's a very exciting scene, as Lhamo initially gives off the impression that he is a very spoiled child, and it's hard to imagine that he will chose the correct objects and eventually train to become the Dalai Llama. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a particular interest in the process of discovering the next Dalai Llama, and is interested in the political aspect and implications of being the leader of a religious group.

    I saw the movie "Kundun" recently, directed by Martin Scorsese. This movie was somewhat reminiscent to that of "The Last Emperor" (the movie depicting the life of Puyi). But rather, takes on more of a religious perspective, showing the life of the 14th Dalai Lama. The movie was set in a beautiful location, with magnificent views of the Tibetan mountainous region. The music really went well with the visuals. It didn't draw attention nor did it put me to sleep. The graphics and setting of the film was spectacular and one of the best. I especially liked the scene when Kundun was washing away the sand mandala. The costumes of the Buddhist monks were very well detailed and interesting. I enjoyed the serenity of the backdrop, which really gave a relaxing feel to the film. I felt that this movie left out a lot of significant parts of the the Dalai Lama. They left out how his life after his exile, which I think is important as to the development of him today. It should include scenes where the Dalai Lama was appealing to foreign countries for refuge and aid. The actors of the film were good portrayals, especially both of the young and middle-age Kundun. The only bad portrayal was of Mao Zedong. The actor didn't really resemble him well and his acting as Chairman Mao had gone overboard. The entire movie revolved mostly around the Chinese Communist Party claiming Tibet and forcing the Dalai Lama out, instead it should focus more on the Dalai Lama's spiritual journey at the same time. The theme of government against religion is significant in today's ever changing society and I believe it was well filmed. There should be a balance of Dalai Lama's religious influence yet at the same time showing his history. The film had it's good points especially the fascinating process of finding Kundun and how he dealt with other people. This film is more suited to those who enjoy a great historical depiction of a man who went on a religious journey influenced by politics of the Chinese Communist Party. The also had brilliant scenery. This is definitely one of Martin Scorsese's best films so far.

    I think I am well versed in Buddhism to say that, contrary to the majority opinion, this is a superficial smattering of a wonderful practice. I don't know whose fault it is, certainly Scorsese's though he is an outsider so that is sort of to be expected. I suspect the Dalai Lama's circle were fine with a superficially romantic portrayal, so long as it generates awareness for their just cause. Why do I say this? The main narrative device that gives this any sort of shape (otherwise it is one long picture-pretty rambling), is the DL meditating in exile, possibly at that balcony at the Indian border, possibly at a much later time. This would be in line with the recurring motifs of prescient visions and the spyglass (looking from a distance) which is first introduced right after the screening of a silent film (the association is with memory, illusions and time gone - all things to purify the mind from in meditation). This would somewhat excuse the fragmentary nature of the narrative and quaint focus of it on young boy versus evil empire of millions, since it was all experienced from his end. Somewhat. It is still absolutely tepid as a historic film if we switch to the 'objective' pov. Now, this last segment of the crossing to India is accompanied by the one powerful visual meditation in the film, it is not mentioned but what you see is the Kalachakra initiation with the Great Sand Mandala being constructed and brushed away, a powerful and sacred occasion. Get it? This is it, this one moment. The DL is heartbroken and his courage waning, and lost in meditation, he finds peace in reminding himself of the transience of all things, which is what the ritual represents and a core Buddhist precept, the cosmos being washed away back into river-sand. The entire rest of the film is a pageant; oracles hiss, rituals go on, dances, ornate ceremonies, hushed whispers of banality. Scorsese mistakes here the theater of appearances (the religion) for the essence. He films the ritual as the thing-in-itself, as spectacle, instead of as the space that allows you to cultivate a compassionate mind. The postcard instead of the real spiritual landscape. How rich this would be if, for instance, we had contrasts between flows of remembered ordinary life and abstractions in three- and twodimensional space in the dances and mandala, and all of that (all the costumes, the ceremonies, the symbols and human suffering) understood as different sides of one image -empty- brushed away as the mind heals itself. I am in awe of the possibilities! No dice. Scorsese films operatic platitudes. Skip this if you want to know Buddhism. Go straight for Why Did Bodhidharma Left for the East? or even Herzog's Buddhist doc, which he also filmed around the Kalachakra. Blowup, if you want deep, incidentally Buddhist essaying on the roots of suffering.

    Probably the foremost reason why most people are disappointed with this movie is because it's a Martin Scorsese movie, without anything about it that screams out Martin Scorsese. It probably was simply a subject he had a real interest and love for, which blinded him it seems. Sure, it focuses on its main subject but everything surrounding it gets completely ignored it seemed, which made this movie mostly a disappointing watch. Don't go watch this movie expecting to learn everything about Tibet, Buddhism or the Dalai Lama. Seriously, after watching this movie I don't feel like I have learned anything.

But I am not discussing his life or existence, merely Martin Scorscese's representation of it, and unfortunately while it is a worthwhile story that deserves telling, if you are aware of the basics it doesn't bring much more to the table than a Movie of the Week. Final Rating for the Dalai Lama  10 / 10. Great bloke. We should all try to be more like him in our daily lives. Final Rating  7 / 10. If you don't know the basics of the 14th Dalai Lama's life, watch it for the information. If you do it doesn't bring much more to the table.

    This is quite a long movie, as most historical type movies tend to be. Kundun clearly has meaning for the Darli Lama and I have watched this movie for first time thirteen years after its original release, a filler in summer 2010 when there are no more good movies to watch at the moment. Watched it with my 12 year old son who turned to the net afterwards to check information about the Dar ly Lama and Tibet and also the Chinese invasion of Tibet. It is a beautiful film and the story is well told, if a little slow and tedious at times. this is in a different category of film making for Martin Scorsese and this will for me stay in the memory. A film for all ages, nothing graphically or verbally uncomfortable about this movie, it does the job of entertaining me one Sunday afternoon!

    I excepted a lot from this movie, and it did deliver. There is some great Buddhist wisdom in this movie. The real Dalai Lama is a very interesting person, and I think there is a lot of wisdom in Buddhism. The music, of course, sounds like Koyanisquatsi because it is by Philip Glass. This adds to the beauty of the movie. Whereas other biographies of famous people tend to get very poor this movie always stays focused and gives a good and honest portrayal of the Dalai Lama. All things being equal, it is a great movie, and I really enjoyed it. It is not like Taxi Driver of course but as a biography of a famous person it is really a great film indeed.

    The tale of the 14th Dalai Lama is very much like the story of the Last Emperor of China, Pu Yi. A boy handpicked to be a ruler of a country, grown up within confined solitude, kicked out of reign from Communist China, and then labeled as a criminal. The only real significance is that Pu Yi faced years in a concentration camp while the Dalai Lama managed to escape to India. That aside, it is not surprising to find in Scorsese's "Kundun" that he was heavily inspired by Bernardo Bertolucci's epic film "The Last Emperor". There were times when I was watching "Kundun" that I could not help wonder if this was an unofficial sequel. The costumes, techniques of candle lit lighting at night, story arc, and overall biography character-type was similar. I am not claiming Scorsese a copycat at all. It's just these two films are so alike. Just one happens to be about China's ruler and the other Tibet's. What worked so well for "The Last Emperor" is that despite its fancy set pieces and costumes, Bertolucci punched good in character drama and an overall intriguing plot. "Kundun" lacks both of these. Each scene in this movie drifts from one part of the Dalai Lama's life to another chronologically and in a sort of schizophrenic nature-the movie itself does not seem to know what it is really about. This is the biggest danger a filmmaker can fall into in making a bio-pic film, trying to cover too much ground without enough time nor interest to piece it all together. The acting suffers not from bad actors, but bad writing. Every moment is devoid of emotion, depicting every Tibetan character in a careless monotone. Then again, most characters are Buddhist monks and emotion is not their strong point. When I watch a movie, however, I expect to be engaged by an actor's talent. This magic is lost in this movie. "Kundun" does succeed at least in the technical aspects. Roger Deakins cinematography is stunning to watch and almost pushes the barrier on what can be done with a camera, whether it be an elaborate steadi-cam shot or a detailed close-up. Philip Glass's score creates a sort of mood that hints to an ethereal supernaturalism, combined with a brooding choir, a lush percussion, and bombastic brass. It supports the visual images nicely. I admit that it seems to take over the movie to the point that there is no other sound present, especially with the horn blasts of flatulence caliber. The one factor that presented mild interest for me was how fair Scorsese treated the Tibetan culture. Little nuances like the funeral rites, the teachings of Buddha, and the Dalai Lama's philosophy are interesting. Yet great cinematography, a sublime soundtrack, and a good treatment of a lost culture cannot save a film. It is a bit disheartening since Scorsese has made some very good movies outside of the gangster genre (ex: Hugo, Shutter Island). While he kept his visuals and artsy elements at full throttle, all other elements are at a loss. This kind of movie is clearly not his cup of tea.

    Kundun is a movie about the search for the Dalai Llama. In the beginning, a monk comes to search for the next Dalai Llama. He finds a young boy named Lhamo, who initially seems like a very self-centered, short-tempered child. However, the monks give Lhamo a test by placing a series of objects in front of him, to see if he will chose the objects that belonged to the preceding Dalai Llama. Then, upon passing the test, Lhamo is taken to the monastery where he begins to grow up and mature. He meets Regent Reting Rinpoche, who was the man that discovered Lhamo's existence through a vision he had while sleeping. However, the Chinese Communists imprison and kill Regent Reting Rinpoche, and Lhamo meets with Chairman Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong expresses to Lhamo that "religion is poison", and they are never able to settle on any agreements. Lhamo, upon being pursued by the Chinese, flees to the Indian Mountains. At a mountain border crossing, an Indian guard asks Lhamo if he is the Lord Buddha, and Lhamo replies, "I think that I am a reflection, like the moon on water. When you see me, and I try to be a good man, you see yourself." Personally, one of my favorite parts about the movie was the scene where Lhamo is picking up the objects that are placed in front of him by the monks. It's a very exciting scene, as Lhamo initially gives off the impression that he is a very spoiled child, and it's hard to imagine that he will chose the correct objects and eventually train to become the Dalai Llama. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a particular interest in the process of discovering the next Dalai Llama, and is interested in the political aspect and implications of being the leader of a religious group.

    I saw the movie "Kundun" recently, directed by Martin Scorsese. This movie was somewhat reminiscent to that of "The Last Emperor" (the movie depicting the life of Puyi). But rather, takes on more of a religious perspective, showing the life of the 14th Dalai Lama. The movie was set in a beautiful location, with magnificent views of the Tibetan mountainous region. The music really went well with the visuals. It didn't draw attention nor did it put me to sleep. The graphics and setting of the film was spectacular and one of the best. I especially liked the scene when Kundun was washing away the sand mandala. The costumes of the Buddhist monks were very well detailed and interesting. I enjoyed the serenity of the backdrop, which really gave a relaxing feel to the film. I felt that this movie left out a lot of significant parts of the the Dalai Lama. They left out how his life after his exile, which I think is important as to the development of him today. It should include scenes where the Dalai Lama was appealing to foreign countries for refuge and aid. The actors of the film were good portrayals, especially both of the young and middle-age Kundun. The only bad portrayal was of Mao Zedong. The actor didn't really resemble him well and his acting as Chairman Mao had gone overboard. The entire movie revolved mostly around the Chinese Communist Party claiming Tibet and forcing the Dalai Lama out, instead it should focus more on the Dalai Lama's spiritual journey at the same time. The theme of government against religion is significant in today's ever changing society and I believe it was well filmed. There should be a balance of Dalai Lama's religious influence yet at the same time showing his history. The film had it's good points especially the fascinating process of finding Kundun and how he dealt with other people. This film is more suited to those who enjoy a great historical depiction of a man who went on a religious journey influenced by politics of the Chinese Communist Party. The also had brilliant scenery. This is definitely one of Martin Scorsese's best films so far.

    I think I am well versed in Buddhism to say that, contrary to the majority opinion, this is a superficial smattering of a wonderful practice. I don't know whose fault it is, certainly Scorsese's though he is an outsider so that is sort of to be expected. I suspect the Dalai Lama's circle were fine with a superficially romantic portrayal, so long as it generates awareness for their just cause. Why do I say this? The main narrative device that gives this any sort of shape (otherwise it is one long picture-pretty rambling), is the DL meditating in exile, possibly at that balcony at the Indian border, possibly at a much later time. This would be in line with the recurring motifs of prescient visions and the spyglass (looking from a distance) which is first introduced right after the screening of a silent film (the association is with memory, illusions and time gone - all things to purify the mind from in meditation). This would somewhat excuse the fragmentary nature of the narrative and quaint focus of it on young boy versus evil empire of millions, since it was all experienced from his end. Somewhat. It is still absolutely tepid as a historic film if we switch to the 'objective' pov. Now, this last segment of the crossing to India is accompanied by the one powerful visual meditation in the film, it is not mentioned but what you see is the Kalachakra initiation with the Great Sand Mandala being constructed and brushed away, a powerful and sacred occasion. Get it? This is it, this one moment. The DL is heartbroken and his courage waning, and lost in meditation, he finds peace in reminding himself of the transience of all things, which is what the ritual represents and a core Buddhist precept, the cosmos being washed away back into river-sand. The entire rest of the film is a pageant; oracles hiss, rituals go on, dances, ornate ceremonies, hushed whispers of banality. Scorsese mistakes here the theater of appearances (the religion) for the essence. He films the ritual as the thing-in-itself, as spectacle, instead of as the space that allows you to cultivate a compassionate mind. The postcard instead of the real spiritual landscape. How rich this would be if, for instance, we had contrasts between flows of remembered ordinary life and abstractions in three- and twodimensional space in the dances and mandala, and all of that (all the costumes, the ceremonies, the symbols and human suffering) understood as different sides of one image -empty- brushed away as the mind heals itself. I am in awe of the possibilities! No dice. Scorsese films operatic platitudes. Skip this if you want to know Buddhism. Go straight for Why Did Bodhidharma Left for the East? or even Herzog's Buddhist doc, which he also filmed around the Kalachakra. Blowup, if you want deep, incidentally Buddhist essaying on the roots of suffering.

    Probably the foremost reason why most people are disappointed with this movie is because it's a Martin Scorsese movie, without anything about it that screams out Martin Scorsese. It probably was simply a subject he had a real interest and love for, which blinded him it seems. Sure, it focuses on its main subject but everything surrounding it gets completely ignored it seemed, which made this movie mostly a disappointing watch. Don't go watch this movie expecting to learn everything about Tibet, Buddhism or the Dalai Lama. Seriously, after watching this movie I don't feel like I have learned anything. It doesn't explain anything about the religion and rituals, or tells you what the Dalai Lama is all about and what he stands for. It actually made this a very shallow movie experience, which I never could feel involved with. The only way I could see this movie being interesting, is if you are already into the subject and have some basic knowledge about it. For a movie with a subject such as this one has, it's surprisingly lacking depth. You would expect the movie to be filled with ancient wisdoms concerning spirituality, knowledge and peace. Absolutely none of that present in this movie. It simply follows its main subject around and that's it really. Evertyhing that happens around him and every story aspects that potentially could had been interesting gets handled poorly and all remains very underdeveloped. Another thing that felt wrong about this movie was its acting. The movie uses non-professionals of Tibetan descent, forced to speak English. If first of all feels wrong to hear them all speak English but next to that, the acting itself from most of the actors is far from anything too impressive. No, it's not like I hated this movie. After all, it remains perfectly watchable but it never got interesting or involving enough in any way. What saves it is that it's still a technically well made movie, that is great looking as well. Most people will praise the cinematographer or director for this but in some cases, such as this one, you should simply give most credit the natural environments. I mean, I don't think it was possible for the film-makers to let this movie look ugly, even if they tried really hard to do so. Too distant and shallow to call this a great or recommendable movie. 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Kundun is legendary film director Martin Scorsese's follow-up to his 1995 masterpiece, Casino. I watched this considering how much I love Martin Scorsese, and when I watched it, I was astounded! Kundun is outstanding from start to finish, it is absolutely dazzling and astonishing! By the way, Kundun is about this: from childhood until adulthood, Tibet's 14th dalai lama deals with Chinese oppression and other problems. Before I continue, let my say something. Why did I like this movie? I liked it for a number of reasons. I did not like it just because it is directed by my all time favorite film director, Martin Scorsese, I liked it for other reasons, such as the acting, the scenery, and especially, the costumes. The costumes in this movie were stupendous, the person who designed them should have been at least nominated for the Academy Award For Best Costume Design, or possibly even won. Kundun scores another great movie for Martin Scorsese, it is big proof of his fabulous talent at directing movies! When I watched this movie, I decided to think of it not as a Martin Scorsese movie, but as a movie, and when it was over, I simply was blown away! It is really interesting that the same man who directed classics like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Casino, and Raging Bull would direct such a great movie like this! But this was not the end for good ol' Martin Scorsese, he would eventually direct Gangs Of New York in 2002, The Avaitor in 2004, and not to mention, The Departed in 2006, which brought him the Academy Award for Best Director. But getting back to Kundun, he has once again managed to astonish us with his fabulous directing talents! It is really amazing that even as Scorsese gets old, he hasn't lost his touch at directing, one of the few other directors besides him who was like that is Sidney Lumet, proved that with his last film, Before The Devil Knows You're Dead. Kundun is absolutely superb, it has results that must be seen in order to be believed. If you haven't seen this movie, then watch it. Why? Because it's excellent, it is one of the best films of 1997. Scorsese is also good at telling a story. When he tells a story, the story grabs hold of you and it holds on until the very minute that the end credits begin to roll, yes, it really is that compelling, it simply won't let go of you until the end of a movie. This happened to me in quite a few Scorsese films, such as Goodfellas, The Departed, Casino, and the very film I talking about right now, Kundun. Allow Martin Scorsese to once again show that he is one of the greatest film directors ever made when you watch Kundun, because when you watch it, you will be thrilled by what you will see. Trust me, when you watch this film, you will see what I mean when I say that this film is great, because it is great! 10/10

    Martin Scorsese recounts the official version of the Dalai Lama's biography from his birth until the onset of his exile in India in 1959. In stunning images. That's it. And that's not enough. None of Marty's extraordinary narrative style is apparent here (although the movie is a showcase for cameraman Roger Deakins, who has since become the cinematographer of choice for the Coen brothers). Since the Dalai Lama is a real, and really ambivalent, political as well as religious figure, offering up a glossy 2-hours commercial on him simply isn't enough. The most egregious example of the movie's intentional superficiality is when the deposed Tibetan regent Reting Rinpoche perishes in the dungeons of the Potala palace and the Dalai Lama reacts to this by ... erm, performing a noble blessing gesture and then doing feck all. Was he in on it himself, or at least aware that there was a conspiracy, which he chose to ignore? But for what reasons? This movie won't tell you. It just wallows on in beautiful images.

    OK. Lately I've watched nothing but horror movies and silly comedies so I thought I would broaden my horizons somewhat and grab a more serious film and perhaps try to learn something for a change. I've now done that and can't say I feel that appreciably better for the experience. It must be a pretty weird feeling for a 2 or 3 year old kid to be told he is to run a country, and one that I might never experience - given I am nearer 40. The problem with Kundun is the subject matter. The movie concerns the discovery and life of the 14th (and current) Dalai Lama, and of course there is a fair amount of time focusing on the Chinese invasion and occupation of Tibet. Now I am not saying this isn't a worthwhile and amazing life, only that most people with a 7th grade education know this already, and unlike say "Saving Private Ryan", where we know the story but go for the ride because of the action, there just isn't much action to be found in Kundun. We meet the 14th Dalai Lama when his folks still call him his given name, which I don't remember hearing. Once he is chosen, he is immediately taken from his parents for training over the ensuing years to be the spiritual leader of Tibet. Being a pre-pubescent leader of a nation has its disadvantages believe it or not, at one point the young Dalai Lama is being briefed on the less than friendly intentions of neighbouring China, being reasonably practical he asks: "How many soldiers (does Tibet have)?" "5,000" "So many! That's a lot, well we are safe here." Of course then China decides that when you are a billion strong "No" doesn't necessarily mean "No", they invade and commence an occupation of Tibet. They attempt to influence the people and grease the wheels through manipulating the Dalai Lama - who initially fled for his safety, only to return to face the music and be a figurehead to his people. According to the film the discussions and dealings between the Chinese and the Dalai Lama were cordial and mostly above board, again in reality history has not been so kind to the Chinese where the dealings with the Tibetan people are concerned. I am amazed with the access that the Chinese people had that they never killed him, regardless of the backlash from a people that already resented their presence. As we all now know the Dalai Lama is one of the most revered pacifists on the planet, and unfortunately relations between Tibet and China are still frosty at best. Throughout the entire period of exile - which now spans many decades - he has maintained that China must leave Tibet but has never suggested violence or aggressive action of any kind. His teachings are followed (more than) fervently by millions and in reality the world would be a far better place if even more people lived a little more like him. But I am not discussing his life or existence, merely Martin Scorscese's representation of it, and unfortunately while it is a worthwhile story that deserves telling, if you are aware of the basics it doesn't bring much more to the table than a Movie of the Week. Final Rating for the Dalai Lama  10 / 10. Great bloke. We should all try to be more like him in our daily lives. Final Rating  7 / 10. If you don't know the basics of the 14th Dalai Lama's life, watch it for the information. If you do it doesn't bring much more to the table.

I especially liked the scene when Kundun was washing away the sand mandala. The costumes of the Buddhist monks were very well detailed and interesting. I enjoyed the serenity of the backdrop, which really gave a relaxing feel to the film. I felt that this movie left out a lot of significant parts of the the Dalai Lama. They left out how his life after his exile, which I think is important as to the development of him today. It should include scenes where the Dalai Lama was appealing to foreign countries for refuge and aid. The actors of the film were good portrayals, especially both of the young and middle-age Kundun. The only bad portrayal was of Mao Zedong. The actor didn't really resemble him well and his acting as Chairman Mao had gone overboard. The entire movie revolved mostly around the Chinese Communist Party claiming Tibet and forcing the Dalai Lama out, instead it should focus more on the Dalai Lama's spiritual journey at the same time. The theme of government against religion is significant in today's ever changing society and I believe it was well filmed. There should be a balance of Dalai Lama's religious influence yet at the same time showing his history. The film had it's good points especially the fascinating process of finding Kundun and how he dealt with other people. This film is more suited to those who enjoy a great historical depiction of a man who went on a religious journey influenced by politics of the Chinese Communist Party. The also had brilliant scenery. This is definitely one of Martin Scorsese's best films so far.

    I think I am well versed in Buddhism to say that, contrary to the majority opinion, this is a superficial smattering of a wonderful practice. I don't know whose fault it is, certainly Scorsese's though he is an outsider so that is sort of to be expected. I suspect the Dalai Lama's circle were fine with a superficially romantic portrayal, so long as it generates awareness for their just cause. Why do I say this? The main narrative device that gives this any sort of shape (otherwise it is one long picture-pretty rambling), is the DL meditating in exile, possibly at that balcony at the Indian border, possibly at a much later time. This would be in line with the recurring motifs of prescient visions and the spyglass (looking from a distance) which is first introduced right after the screening of a silent film (the association is with memory, illusions and time gone - all things to purify the mind from in meditation). This would somewhat excuse the fragmentary nature of the narrative and quaint focus of it on young boy versus evil empire of millions, since it was all experienced from his end. Somewhat. It is still absolutely tepid as a historic film if we switch to the 'objective' pov. Now, this last segment of the crossing to India is accompanied by the one powerful visual meditation in the film, it is not mentioned but what you see is the Kalachakra initiation with the Great Sand Mandala being constructed and brushed away, a powerful and sacred occasion. Get it? This is it, this one moment. The DL is heartbroken and his courage waning, and lost in meditation, he finds peace in reminding himself of the transience of all things, which is what the ritual represents and a core Buddhist precept, the cosmos being washed away back into river-sand. The entire rest of the film is a pageant; oracles hiss, rituals go on, dances, ornate ceremonies, hushed whispers of banality. Scorsese mistakes here the theater of appearances (the religion) for the essence. He films the ritual as the thing-in-itself, as spectacle, instead of as the space that allows you to cultivate a compassionate mind. The postcard instead of the real spiritual landscape. How rich this would be if, for instance, we had contrasts between flows of remembered ordinary life and abstractions in three- and twodimensional space in the dances and mandala, and all of that (all the costumes, the ceremonies, the symbols and human suffering) understood as different sides of one image -empty- brushed away as the mind heals itself. I am in awe of the possibilities! No dice. Scorsese films operatic platitudes. Skip this if you want to know Buddhism. Go straight for Why Did Bodhidharma Left for the East? or even Herzog's Buddhist doc, which he also filmed around the Kalachakra. Blowup, if you want deep, incidentally Buddhist essaying on the roots of suffering.

    Probably the foremost reason why most people are disappointed with this movie is because it's a Martin Scorsese movie, without anything about it that screams out Martin Scorsese. It probably was simply a subject he had a real interest and love for, which blinded him it seems. Sure, it focuses on its main subject but everything surrounding it gets completely ignored it seemed, which made this movie mostly a disappointing watch. Don't go watch this movie expecting to learn everything about Tibet, Buddhism or the Dalai Lama. Seriously, after watching this movie I don't feel like I have learned anything. It doesn't explain anything about the religion and rituals, or tells you what the Dalai Lama is all about and what he stands for. It actually made this a very shallow movie experience, which I never could feel involved with. The only way I could see this movie being interesting, is if you are already into the subject and have some basic knowledge about it. For a movie with a subject such as this one has, it's surprisingly lacking depth. You would expect the movie to be filled with ancient wisdoms concerning spirituality, knowledge and peace. Absolutely none of that present in this movie. It simply follows its main subject around and that's it really. Evertyhing that happens around him and every story aspects that potentially could had been interesting gets handled poorly and all remains very underdeveloped. Another thing that felt wrong about this movie was its acting. The movie uses non-professionals of Tibetan descent, forced to speak English. If first of all feels wrong to hear them all speak English but next to that, the acting itself from most of the actors is far from anything too impressive. No, it's not like I hated this movie. After all, it remains perfectly watchable but it never got interesting or involving enough in any way. What saves it is that it's still a technically well made movie, that is great looking as well. Most people will praise the cinematographer or director for this but in some cases, such as this one, you should simply give most credit the natural environments. I mean, I don't think it was possible for the film-makers to let this movie look ugly, even if they tried really hard to do so. Too distant and shallow to call this a great or recommendable movie. 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Kundun is legendary film director Martin Scorsese's follow-up to his 1995 masterpiece, Casino. I watched this considering how much I love Martin Scorsese, and when I watched it, I was astounded! Kundun is outstanding from start to finish, it is absolutely dazzling and astonishing! By the way, Kundun is about this: from childhood until adulthood, Tibet's 14th dalai lama deals with Chinese oppression and other problems. Before I continue, let my say something. Why did I like this movie? I liked it for a number of reasons. I did not like it just because it is directed by my all time favorite film director, Martin Scorsese, I liked it for other reasons, such as the acting, the scenery, and especially, the costumes. The costumes in this movie were stupendous, the person who designed them should have been at least nominated for the Academy Award For Best Costume Design, or possibly even won. Kundun scores another great movie for Martin Scorsese, it is big proof of his fabulous talent at directing movies! When I watched this movie, I decided to think of it not as a Martin Scorsese movie, but as a movie, and when it was over, I simply was blown away! It is really interesting that the same man who directed classics like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Casino, and Raging Bull would direct such a great movie like this! But this was not the end for good ol' Martin Scorsese, he would eventually direct Gangs Of New York in 2002, The Avaitor in 2004, and not to mention, The Departed in 2006, which brought him the Academy Award for Best Director. But getting back to Kundun, he has once again managed to astonish us with his fabulous directing talents! It is really amazing that even as Scorsese gets old, he hasn't lost his touch at directing, one of the few other directors besides him who was like that is Sidney Lumet, proved that with his last film, Before The Devil Knows You're Dead. Kundun is absolutely superb, it has results that must be seen in order to be believed. If you haven't seen this movie, then watch it. Why? Because it's excellent, it is one of the best films of 1997. Scorsese is also good at telling a story. When he tells a story, the story grabs hold of you and it holds on until the very minute that the end credits begin to roll, yes, it really is that compelling, it simply won't let go of you until the end of a movie. This happened to me in quite a few Scorsese films, such as Goodfellas, The Departed, Casino, and the very film I talking about right now, Kundun. Allow Martin Scorsese to once again show that he is one of the greatest film directors ever made when you watch Kundun, because when you watch it, you will be thrilled by what you will see. Trust me, when you watch this film, you will see what I mean when I say that this film is great, because it is great! 10/10

    Martin Scorsese recounts the official version of the Dalai Lama's biography from his birth until the onset of his exile in India in 1959. In stunning images. That's it. And that's not enough. None of Marty's extraordinary narrative style is apparent here (although the movie is a showcase for cameraman Roger Deakins, who has since become the cinematographer of choice for the Coen brothers). Since the Dalai Lama is a real, and really ambivalent, political as well as religious figure, offering up a glossy 2-hours commercial on him simply isn't enough. The most egregious example of the movie's intentional superficiality is when the deposed Tibetan regent Reting Rinpoche perishes in the dungeons of the Potala palace and the Dalai Lama reacts to this by ... erm, performing a noble blessing gesture and then doing feck all. Was he in on it himself, or at least aware that there was a conspiracy, which he chose to ignore? But for what reasons? This movie won't tell you. It just wallows on in beautiful images.

    OK. Lately I've watched nothing but horror movies and silly comedies so I thought I would broaden my horizons somewhat and grab a more serious film and perhaps try to learn something for a change. I've now done that and can't say I feel that appreciably better for the experience. It must be a pretty weird feeling for a 2 or 3 year old kid to be told he is to run a country, and one that I might never experience - given I am nearer 40. The problem with Kundun is the subject matter. The movie concerns the discovery and life of the 14th (and current) Dalai Lama, and of course there is a fair amount of time focusing on the Chinese invasion and occupation of Tibet. Now I am not saying this isn't a worthwhile and amazing life, only that most people with a 7th grade education know this already, and unlike say "Saving Private Ryan", where we know the story but go for the ride because of the action, there just isn't much action to be found in Kundun. We meet the 14th Dalai Lama when his folks still call him his given name, which I don't remember hearing. Once he is chosen, he is immediately taken from his parents for training over the ensuing years to be the spiritual leader of Tibet. Being a pre-pubescent leader of a nation has its disadvantages believe it or not, at one point the young Dalai Lama is being briefed on the less than friendly intentions of neighbouring China, being reasonably practical he asks: "How many soldiers (does Tibet have)?" "5,000" "So many! That's a lot, well we are safe here." Of course then China decides that when you are a billion strong "No" doesn't necessarily mean "No", they invade and commence an occupation of Tibet. They attempt to influence the people and grease the wheels through manipulating the Dalai Lama - who initially fled for his safety, only to return to face the music and be a figurehead to his people. According to the film the discussions and dealings between the Chinese and the Dalai Lama were cordial and mostly above board, again in reality history has not been so kind to the Chinese where the dealings with the Tibetan people are concerned. I am amazed with the access that the Chinese people had that they never killed him, regardless of the backlash from a people that already resented their presence. As we all now know the Dalai Lama is one of the most revered pacifists on the planet, and unfortunately relations between Tibet and China are still frosty at best. Throughout the entire period of exile - which now spans many decades - he has maintained that China must leave Tibet but has never suggested violence or aggressive action of any kind. His teachings are followed (more than) fervently by millions and in reality the world would be a far better place if even more people lived a little more like him. But I am not discussing his life or existence, merely Martin Scorscese's representation of it, and unfortunately while it is a worthwhile story that deserves telling, if you are aware of the basics it doesn't bring much more to the table than a Movie of the Week. Final Rating for the Dalai Lama  10 / 10. Great bloke. We should all try to be more like him in our daily lives. Final Rating  7 / 10. If you don't know the basics of the 14th Dalai Lama's life, watch it for the information. If you do it doesn't bring much more to the table.

    This is quite a long movie, as most historical type movies tend to be. Kundun clearly has meaning for the Darli Lama and I have watched this movie for first time thirteen years after its original release, a filler in summer 2010 when there are no more good movies to watch at the moment. Watched it with my 12 year old son who turned to the net afterwards to check information about the Dar ly Lama and Tibet and also the Chinese invasion of Tibet. It is a beautiful film and the story is well told, if a little slow and tedious at times. this is in a different category of film making for Martin Scorsese and this will for me stay in the memory. A film for all ages, nothing graphically or verbally uncomfortable about this movie, it does the job of entertaining me one Sunday afternoon!

    I excepted a lot from this movie, and it did deliver. There is some great Buddhist wisdom in this movie. The real Dalai Lama is a very interesting person, and I think there is a lot of wisdom in Buddhism. The music, of course, sounds like Koyanisquatsi because it is by Philip Glass. This adds to the beauty of the movie. Whereas other biographies of famous people tend to get very poor this movie always stays focused and gives a good and honest portrayal of the Dalai Lama. All things being equal, it is a great movie, and I really enjoyed it. It is not like Taxi Driver of course but as a biography of a famous person it is really a great film indeed.

    The tale of the 14th Dalai Lama is very much like the story of the Last Emperor of China, Pu Yi. A boy handpicked to be a ruler of a country, grown up within confined solitude, kicked out of reign from Communist China, and then labeled as a criminal. The only real significance is that Pu Yi faced years in a concentration camp while the Dalai Lama managed to escape to India. That aside, it is not surprising to find in Scorsese's "Kundun" that he was heavily inspired by Bernardo Bertolucci's epic film "The Last Emperor". There were times when I was watching "Kundun" that I could not help wonder if this was an unofficial sequel. The costumes, techniques of candle lit lighting at night, story arc, and overall biography character-type was similar. I am not claiming Scorsese a copycat at all. It's just these two films are so alike. Just one happens to be about China's ruler and the other Tibet's. What worked so well for "The Last Emperor" is that despite its fancy set pieces and costumes, Bertolucci punched good in character drama and an overall intriguing plot. "Kundun" lacks both of these. Each scene in this movie drifts from one part of the Dalai Lama's life to another chronologically and in a sort of schizophrenic nature-the movie itself does not seem to know what it is really about. This is the biggest danger a filmmaker can fall into in making a bio-pic film, trying to cover too much ground without enough time nor interest to piece it all together. The acting suffers not from bad actors, but bad writing. Every moment is devoid of emotion, depicting every Tibetan character in a careless monotone. Then again, most characters are Buddhist monks and emotion is not their strong point. When I watch a movie, however, I expect to be engaged by an actor's talent. This magic is lost in this movie. "Kundun" does succeed at least in the technical aspects. Roger Deakins cinematography is stunning to watch and almost pushes the barrier on what can be done with a camera, whether it be an elaborate steadi-cam shot or a detailed close-up. Philip Glass's score creates a sort of mood that hints to an ethereal supernaturalism, combined with a brooding choir, a lush percussion, and bombastic brass. It supports the visual images nicely. I admit that it seems to take over the movie to the point that there is no other sound present, especially with the horn blasts of flatulence caliber. The one factor that presented mild interest for me was how fair Scorsese treated the Tibetan culture. Little nuances like the funeral rites, the teachings of Buddha, and the Dalai Lama's philosophy are interesting. Yet great cinematography, a sublime soundtrack, and a good treatment of a lost culture cannot save a film. It is a bit disheartening since Scorsese has made some very good movies outside of the gangster genre (ex: Hugo, Shutter Island). While he kept his visuals and artsy elements at full throttle, all other elements are at a loss. This kind of movie is clearly not his cup of tea.

    Kundun is a movie about the search for the Dalai Llama. In the beginning, a monk comes to search for the next Dalai Llama. He finds a young boy named Lhamo, who initially seems like a very self-centered, short-tempered child. However, the monks give Lhamo a test by placing a series of objects in front of him, to see if he will chose the objects that belonged to the preceding Dalai Llama. Then, upon passing the test, Lhamo is taken to the monastery where he begins to grow up and mature. He meets Regent Reting Rinpoche, who was the man that discovered Lhamo's existence through a vision he had while sleeping. However, the Chinese Communists imprison and kill Regent Reting Rinpoche, and Lhamo meets with Chairman Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong expresses to Lhamo that "religion is poison", and they are never able to settle on any agreements. Lhamo, upon being pursued by the Chinese, flees to the Indian Mountains. At a mountain border crossing, an Indian guard asks Lhamo if he is the Lord Buddha, and Lhamo replies, "I think that I am a reflection, like the moon on water. When you see me, and I try to be a good man, you see yourself." Personally, one of my favorite parts about the movie was the scene where Lhamo is picking up the objects that are placed in front of him by the monks. It's a very exciting scene, as Lhamo initially gives off the impression that he is a very spoiled child, and it's hard to imagine that he will chose the correct objects and eventually train to become the Dalai Llama. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a particular interest in the process of discovering the next Dalai Llama, and is interested in the political aspect and implications of being the leader of a religious group.

    I saw the movie "Kundun" recently, directed by Martin Scorsese. This movie was somewhat reminiscent to that of "The Last Emperor" (the movie depicting the life of Puyi). But rather, takes on more of a religious perspective, showing the life of the 14th Dalai Lama. The movie was set in a beautiful location, with magnificent views of the Tibetan mountainous region. The music really went well with the visuals. It didn't draw attention nor did it put me to sleep. The graphics and setting of the film was spectacular and one of the best. I especially liked the scene when Kundun was washing away the sand mandala. The costumes of the Buddhist monks were very well detailed and interesting. I enjoyed the serenity of the backdrop, which really gave a relaxing feel to the film. I felt that this movie left out a lot of significant parts of the the Dalai Lama. They left out how his life after his exile, which I think is important as to the development of him today. It should include scenes where the Dalai Lama was appealing to foreign countries for refuge and aid. The actors of the film were good portrayals, especially both of the young and middle-age Kundun. The only bad portrayal was of Mao Zedong. The actor didn't really resemble him well and his acting as Chairman Mao had gone overboard. The entire movie revolved mostly around the Chinese Communist Party claiming Tibet and forcing the Dalai Lama out, instead it should focus more on the Dalai Lama's spiritual journey at the same time. The theme of government against religion is significant in today's ever changing society and I believe it was well filmed. There should be a balance of Dalai Lama's religious influence yet at the same time showing his history. The film had it's good points especially the fascinating process of finding Kundun and how he dealt with other people. This film is more suited to those who enjoy a great historical depiction of a man who went on a religious journey influenced by politics of the Chinese Communist Party. The also had brilliant scenery. This is definitely one of Martin Scorsese's best films so far.

Kundun is absolutely superb, it has results that must be seen in order to be believed. If you haven't seen this movie, then watch it. Why? Because it's excellent, it is one of the best films of 1997. Scorsese is also good at telling a story. When he tells a story, the story grabs hold of you and it holds on until the very minute that the end credits begin to roll, yes, it really is that compelling, it simply won't let go of you until the end of a movie. This happened to me in quite a few Scorsese films, such as Goodfellas, The Departed, Casino, and the very film I talking about right now, Kundun. Allow Martin Scorsese to once again show that he is one of the greatest film directors ever made when you watch Kundun, because when you watch it, you will be thrilled by what you will see. Trust me, when you watch this film, you will see what I mean when I say that this film is great, because it is great! 10/10

    Martin Scorsese recounts the official version of the Dalai Lama's biography from his birth until the onset of his exile in India in 1959. In stunning images. That's it. And that's not enough. None of Marty's extraordinary narrative style is apparent here (although the movie is a showcase for cameraman Roger Deakins, who has since become the cinematographer of choice for the Coen brothers). Since the Dalai Lama is a real, and really ambivalent, political as well as religious figure, offering up a glossy 2-hours commercial on him simply isn't enough. The most egregious example of the movie's intentional superficiality is when the deposed Tibetan regent Reting Rinpoche perishes in the dungeons of the Potala palace and the Dalai Lama reacts to this by ... erm, performing a noble blessing gesture and then doing feck all. Was he in on it himself, or at least aware that there was a conspiracy, which he chose to ignore? But for what reasons? This movie won't tell you. It just wallows on in beautiful images.

    OK. Lately I've watched nothing but horror movies and silly comedies so I thought I would broaden my horizons somewhat and grab a more serious film and perhaps try to learn something for a change. I've now done that and can't say I feel that appreciably better for the experience. It must be a pretty weird feeling for a 2 or 3 year old kid to be told he is to run a country, and one that I might never experience - given I am nearer 40. The problem with Kundun is the subject matter. The movie concerns the discovery and life of the 14th (and current) Dalai Lama, and of course there is a fair amount of time focusing on the Chinese invasion and occupation of Tibet. Now I am not saying this isn't a worthwhile and amazing life, only that most people with a 7th grade education know this already, and unlike say "Saving Private Ryan", where we know the story but go for the ride because of the action, there just isn't much action to be found in Kundun. We meet the 14th Dalai Lama when his folks still call him his given name, which I don't remember hearing. Once he is chosen, he is immediately taken from his parents for training over the ensuing years to be the spiritual leader of Tibet. Being a pre-pubescent leader of a nation has its disadvantages believe it or not, at one point the young Dalai Lama is being briefed on the less than friendly intentions of neighbouring China, being reasonably practical he asks: "How many soldiers (does Tibet have)?" "5,000" "So many! That's a lot, well we are safe here." Of course then China decides that when you are a billion strong "No" doesn't necessarily mean "No", they invade and commence an occupation of Tibet. They attempt to influence the people and grease the wheels through manipulating the Dalai Lama - who initially fled for his safety, only to return to face the music and be a figurehead to his people. According to the film the discussions and dealings between the Chinese and the Dalai Lama were cordial and mostly above board, again in reality history has not been so kind to the Chinese where the dealings with the Tibetan people are concerned. I am amazed with the access that the Chinese people had that they never killed him, regardless of the backlash from a people that already resented their presence. As we all now know the Dalai Lama is one of the most revered pacifists on the planet, and unfortunately relations between Tibet and China are still frosty at best. Throughout the entire period of exile - which now spans many decades - he has maintained that China must leave Tibet but has never suggested violence or aggressive action of any kind. His teachings are followed (more than) fervently by millions and in reality the world would be a far better place if even more people lived a little more like him. But I am not discussing his life or existence, merely Martin Scorscese's representation of it, and unfortunately while it is a worthwhile story that deserves telling, if you are aware of the basics it doesn't bring much more to the table than a Movie of the Week. Final Rating for the Dalai Lama  10 / 10. Great bloke. We should all try to be more like him in our daily lives. Final Rating  7 / 10. If you don't know the basics of the 14th Dalai Lama's life, watch it for the information. If you do it doesn't bring much more to the table.

    This is quite a long movie, as most historical type movies tend to be. Kundun clearly has meaning for the Darli Lama and I have watched this movie for first time thirteen years after its original release, a filler in summer 2010 when there are no more good movies to watch at the moment. Watched it with my 12 year old son who turned to the net afterwards to check information about the Dar ly Lama and Tibet and also the Chinese invasion of Tibet. It is a beautiful film and the story is well told, if a little slow and tedious at times. this is in a different category of film making for Martin Scorsese and this will for me stay in the memory. A film for all ages, nothing graphically or verbally uncomfortable about this movie, it does the job of entertaining me one Sunday afternoon!

    I excepted a lot from this movie, and it did deliver. There is some great Buddhist wisdom in this movie. The real Dalai Lama is a very interesting person, and I think there is a lot of wisdom in Buddhism. The music, of course, sounds like Koyanisquatsi because it is by Philip Glass. This adds to the beauty of the movie. Whereas other biographies of famous people tend to get very poor this movie always stays focused and gives a good and honest portrayal of the Dalai Lama. All things being equal, it is a great movie, and I really enjoyed it. It is not like Taxi Driver of course but as a biography of a famous person it is really a great film indeed.
