 <sinopse>
  In a dystopian future, Dredd, the most famous judge (a cop with instant field judiciary powers) is convicted for a crime he did not commit while his murderous counterpart escapes.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The Year is 2139. The Planet Earth has changed into a virtually uninhabitable place called the "Cursed Earth". All of the Earth's population have crowded into the cities across the planet, now known as "Mega Cities". The crimes in these "Mega cities" became so violent and so powerful, that the regular justice system was powerless to contain, then it collapsed completely. But, a new Justice System came from the ashes, They were 3 justice systems in 1 (Police, Jury and executioner), they were called "Judges". In Mega City 1 (formarly, New York), There was a Judge, named Joseph Dredd, who was the toughest and most stringent Judge in history. One day, he was charged with murder. He was tried and sentenced to life in prison because of it. Then, Dredd found out that it was in fact a person who shares his DNA. Former Judge Rico. Now, Dredd has to find out what Rico is planning to do, and to discover about his past.

    i Enjoy Dredd (2012) it was awesome as well even i Love This Movie but it wasn't balls to the wall Action scenes was good and fun but i agree what Stallone said it wasn't balls to wall agree and i did enjoy Judge Dredd movie with Stallone i liked the acting and his anger in movie like new one and i am not judge Dredd comic book reader sorry i am not but i enjoy and love the movies and i haven't read noting to books to it and i know Dredd doesn't take the helmet off that's what people say and never read the book of it i know people got Disappointment about this i didn't i liked it enjoy i am big Fan of Stallone big one and character Rico Dredd (Armand Assante) was pretty much of Psycho Path crazy guy well i know he is bad guy and Rob Schneider was worst in this movie i didn't find him funny in this film he played in 2 Stallone movies in Judge Dredd and Demotion Man but in this as apart from this movie not really that good when he was in Demotion Man he wasn't really part of movie only in 2 parts that's it in this in start and middle and end i really don't want Rob Schneider to be in this movie it was bit silly when he was in it that's why people saying why Rob in this movie ? people say Stallone Cartoon Version i don't find this Cartoon version i think that's how old movies was like that back then this is why Stallone had a bit Problems was this movie in Thirteen years after the release of Judge Dredd, Sylvester Stallone discussed his feelings about the movie in an issue of Uncut magazine in 2008 and he loved that property when I read it, because it took a genre that I love, what you could term the 'action morality film' and made it a bit more sophisticated. It had political overtones. It showed how if we don't curb the way we run our judicial system, the police may end up running our lives. It dealt with archaic governments; it dealt with cloning and all kinds of things that could happen in the future. It was also bigger than any film I've done in its physical stature and the way it was designed. All the people were dwarfed by the system and the architecture; it shows how insignificant human beings could be in the future. There's a lot of action in the movie and some great acting, too. It just wasn't balls to the wall. But I do look back on Judge Dredd as a real missed opportunity. It seemed that lots of fans had a problem with Dredd removing his helmet, because he never does in the comic books. But for me it is more about wasting such great potential there was in that idea, just think of all the opportunities there were to do interesting stuff with the Cursed Earth scenes. It didn't live up to what it could have been. It probably should have been much more comic, really humorous, and fun. What I learned out of that experience was that we shouldn't have tried to make it Hamlet; it's more Hamlet and Eggs that's what he said the film director for me was idiot Judge Dredd doesn't take out his Hamlet i agree maybe the director said F**ck his idea then the director did his own so he thinks Judge Dredd Fans people might think it's going to be great but you know what you didn't do it well i like movie like i said i love Action scenes him fighting with Rico was awesome and motorbike flying Motorbike and cops chasing Stallone was awesome start is Kinda Same as Dredd (2012) in Apartment shooting kinda same but 2 different movies but in Judge Dredd (1995) was kinda same at start in Apartment shoot out then in Dredd in awesome movie different not remake more of restart like batman Begins but different movies so Judge Dredd awesome and Dredd 2012 awesome both different movies if your a Stallone fan or Judge Dredd witch ones would you like better then first watch this one don't listen to fans they read comic books they comic book reader me i am not i am watch movies so yeah i enjoy this movie 10/10 for Sylvester Stallone

    It could have been Robocop" of the 90's . Instead we have a popcorn movie . The 90's weren't exactly the best time for comic book movies , but still this one has managed to be a decent one. Especially compared to Schumacher's Batman movies. I can't say I'm an expert when it comes to Dredd , but I read few comics about him and they were nice. Stallone is kinda wasted here as the main hero . He is able to play cold blooded , silent and gloomy character . He proved that in "Cobra". The authors too easily allow him to play just himself , not Dredd. Still , he's not bad in his role despite popular opinion . Even he's chin looks just like the chin of comic book Dredd. Max von Sydow , Jurgen Prochnow and Diane Lane all give nice performances and some depth to their characters . Watch out for Liev Schreiber in a small role of young academy judge . Also , Joan Chen makes an appearance . God knows why . There only reason is that they wanted to put a catfight into movie. Unfortunately , there are also two really bad performances that almost destroy the whole movie. Armand Assante who plays the villain, overacts through THE WHOLE MOVIE. He's shouting , smiling evil smiles and making big eyes so often he really is worse than a cartoon villain. Let's not forget about Rob Schneider  one of the most pathetic comediants alive. He's so annoying I wanted to kill him . He says a one funny thing through whole movie - "We don't have time for this" and gives a great parody of Stallone's voice . Except that he's AWFUL. I wonder if Stallone really needed a sidekick , since he does have a few funny one-liners himself. The upbeat music by Alan Silvestri is nice . So is the art-direction . The whole city looks EXACTLY like in the comics . The special effects are little dated in some places , but not bad. The movie pretends to asks some important questions about cloning or how to fight with evil , but only pretends . Too bad . In good hands it could be a good serious science fiction just like "Robocop". Stallone's other movie "The Demolition man " is much better. It doesn't mean this one isn't watchable. I give it 5/10.

    A lot of reviewers turned down this one due to the non-true adaption and the obvious irony plus the "Stallone-type" action style. Well, in fact this movie is extremely entertaining, has a good plot, excellent visuals and give the actors a lot of room and space for their character development. All this makes it better than the recent version of "Dredd". And even that difference between these two movies makes the original Stallone-Version even more better and much more entertaining. Also the violence in the 1995 adaption of the comic is present but does not need any gore to be effective. "Judge Dredd" and "Demolition Man" were true highlights of Stallones action sci-fi period, which unfortunately we not that successful as they probably should have been.

    For the people saying this was the worst movie ever made, get over yourself. The venom of comic book geeks astounds me sometimes, I know because I am one but I pride myself on being able to 'judge' a film on it's own merits. As an adaptation of the comic it is flawed with major points. The now infamous helmet issue seems to be the thing that everyone remembers about the film and Dredd's emotional injection is way off course. The film reeks of studio interference and writers ego when at that time, it was pretty common to stray from the source material for the sake of playing to a certain audience, which was not the fans of the comic. This is the bad! The good is the fact that there is lots of it here. The film looks amazing! The subject has been given the full big budget Hollywood treatment and boy does it show. The sets, scenery effects and make-up are all top quality and really give a great image of a dystopian future. Danny Cannon has a great eye for gorgeous wide shots that really show off an image and it's used to full effect in the film. Mega City one really looks the part and everything bar maybe a few plasticy looking costumes has a real sheen to it! Like it or not, Stallone is perfectly cast as Dredd. He has the physique, the voice and the jaw, it's just a shame that ego got in the way of such a perfect match. The actual film itself, if you are able to pull your head out of your comic book loving arse, is quite honestly a really decent 90's action sci-fi flick. There is lots of excitement and enough to keep anyone occupied for a couple of hours. It does feel however that more could have been explored in the film. Glaring flaws aside Hollywood in the 80's and 90's had a really nasty habit of making a film about a subject matter then writing a story that takes the main character totally out of the norm. This is rectified in the 2012 film where it's just Dredd doing his day to day job and that's what we want. Here Dredd is taken out of his job and thrust into a situation that we just don't want to see him in. At least they kept Rico instead of a generic made up villain and much of the genetic lore of Dredd. If you want a fun action film with a good look to kill an hour or two that Judge Dredd is well worth checking out but if you're looking for authenticity well.....you have the alternative now, so enjoy this for what it is, however an annoyingly missed opportunity it may be!

    As a fan of the comic, this was *dredd*ful. (good one) I own every single one of the comics and was disappointed and unimpressed when I watched this. Problem 1) they got Dredd's helmet wrong. If you are a fan of the comic, Dredd's helmet has a cross across the front. Im so annoyed that they missed this small but distinguishable feature. Problem 2) Dredd is a clone of another judge, and is famous for being a rigid follower of rules. He spares no-one and will carry out punishment as necessary. In this film, he shows too much emotion, which I believed took his authority as 'Dredd' away. Problem 3) They take his helmet off. Why??? You are *not* supposed to see his face! That's the whole point! Maybe i'm over exaggerating, but seriously, that's not good. If you want to understand the point of Judge Dredd without reading all 2000-something comics, see Dredd3d. Thank you. Rant over.

    After watching "Dredd"(2012), I expected less from this movie. But it has all the things I felt the new movie missed. The plot is like one that would be seen in the comic itself. "Dredd" doesn't really utilize much from the comic, besides the setting and characters. But this movie goes above and beyond! Even one of Dredd's classic adversaries is put in the movie! Stallone hits the personality of Judge Dredd dead on, having the serious love of the law while having his occasional comedic moments. "Dredd" is dark, serious, and more gory than Robocop! But this movie, all though not having the best computer animation (it was released in 1995), is a total blast! one of my personal favorites.

    Urban areas have grown into mega-cities that cover entire coastal regions. The justice system has evolved to a single person invested with the power of police, judge, jury, and executioner. Among the Judges of Mega-City One is Dredd, who is one of the best, and a particular favourite of the Head of the Council, Judge Fargo. But there are evil forces at work, block riots and the escape of Rico, a homicidal maniac, are only steps in a plan that ultimately lead to the sentencing of Dredd for a murder he didn't commit. And Dredd must discover the secrets of his own past and survive to stop the evildoers.... Beyond some terrible dialogue, and comic book atrocities, Judge Dredd is simply a summer blockbuster starring an actor whose best years were back in the mid-eighties, which didn't help the film at all. 1995 was a poor year for summer blockbuster. We had Waterworld, Batman Forever, Casper, and of course, Congo. So in all fairness, this is the reason why this film endears me more than others. Stallone is how you would expect, pretty bland, but still a big screen presence whatever the film he's in. And if you were brought up on eighties action, you'll lap it up. The rest of the cast are okay, Lane is a standout, but whatever Assante is on, I really need some. I have never seen a villain so over the top in a movie. Yes, he's supposed to be a psycho and everything, but having literally scream every line and sneer every five minutes is just bonkers. Effects are okay, and Schneider provides unnecessary humour, but all in all it's a big, dumb, fun, summer movie. So what if he takes his helmet off. He was judged.

    Exciting , big-budgeted film dealing with a standard comic book dystopian near-future City where rules fearful judges and happens fantastic events . The source comic book has been a cult favorite in England for thirty years . Loud , spectacular and violent movie set in a future world of urban chaos and based on the comic books by Carlos Ezquerra and John Wagner ; being well adapted by Danny Cannon . In the third Milennium , the futuristic world changed , climate , nations , all were upheaval . The Earth transformed into a poisonous scorched desert , known as &uml;The Cursed Earth&uml;. Millions of people crowed into a few mega Cities where roving bands of street savages created violence the justice system could not control . The Planet Earth has changed into a virtually uninhabitable place . All of the Earth's population have crowded into the cities across the planet , now known as "Mega Cities&uml; . Law as we know it collapsed . From the decay rose a new order whose rule of law is administrated by authorities on motorbikes . A society ruled by a new elite force . A Force with the power to dispense both justice and punishment . They were the police , jury and executioner all in one . They were the judges . Around desert lies Mega City One . It is a violent, futuristic city where a new Justice System came from the ashes , the police has the authority to act as judge, jury and executioner, they were called "Judges" and dispense justice on the riot-torn streets and buildings of Mega City . They fight to control the block riots that over-running the city . The crimes in this "Mega city" became so violent and so powerful, that the regular justice system was powerless to contain, then it collapsed completely . A cop named Dredd , most feared of all , teams with a another judge named Hershey (Diane Lane) to take down criminal gangs , but Dredd is double-crossed and being framed for murder . Dredd fights to clear his name helped by the women-judge and a likable delinquent (Rob Schneider), a renegade misfit named Ferguson , must confront the odds and engage in the relentless battle for their survival . But an escaped convict named Rico (Armand Assante) overtakes the compound's control center and wages a dirty, vicious war against the Judges that proves she will stop at nothing to protect her empire . Rico is an ex-judge who was artificially created and seeks vendetta and power confronting his half-brother , Dredd . Judge Dredd soon released from his imprisonment looks for his genetically contrived evil brother and takes place the final battle . This slam-bang film packs big names , noisy action , thrills , chills , suspense , convoluted screenplay , high body count , loads of massive villains and lots of violence . Some interesting plotting is partially lost in a sea of hard-edge violence , overripe acting , exaggerated explosions and excessive shots . Visually imaginative action Sci-Fi that contains fast and furious fun with echoes of &uml;Metropolis&uml;, &uml;Things to come&uml; and &uml;Blade Runner&uml; . The exciting screenplay throws in Femme cop and a likable inmate , Rob Schneider , who acts as comic relief. The highlights of the movie are a smashing Airbone pursuit on flying motor-bikes and the breathtaking , overwhelming finale . Silvester Stallone's iconic presence is good as a helmeted , emotionless future-cop who dispenses the square jaw-lines and a summary justice. Fizzing visuals , video game-like special effects and impressive production design showing a large megalopolis in &uml;Blade Runner&uml; style . Praiseworthy set design by Nigel Phelps who creates a doleful as well as amazing ghetto City . Atmospheric original music by Alan Silvestri , composed by means of synthesizer . Colorful , though sometimes dark cinematography by Adrian Biddle . The precocious technical mastery displayed by Danny Cannon is spectacular and he delivers narrative fluidity . However , the film failed at box office ; Silvester Stallone , Sly, hoped , in vain , the project would provide him another profitable franchise but it didn't take place . Many years later was shot Dredd 3D (2012) by Pete Travis with Karl Urban , Olivia Thirby and Lena Headley . Rating : 6,5 . Acceptable action film and it will appeal to Stallone enthusiasts and action fans .

    When i was a child i loved this film, having read a lot of Dredd comic books i am a huge fan. I recently watched this film again and cringed at how bad the plot/acting etc was. Rob Schnieder ruins this movie for me. But at the same time it has some fun action and brings me back some happy memories. If you are looking for a good movie with good acting this might not be for you, after all the star is sly Stallone, Although, if you are looking for a fun action film with explosions then give it a go.

    Judge Dredd is directed by Danny Cannon and written by William Wisher Junior and Steven E. de Souza. It stars Sylvester Stallone, Armand Assante, Diane Lane, Rob Schneider, Joan Chen, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and Max von Sydow. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Adrian Biddle. Adapted from the Judge Dredd stories in British comic book 2000AD, the plot finds Stallone as Joseph Judge Dredd, a ruthless law enforcer of the future in Mega City 1. Framed for murder, Dredd finds himself on the other side of the fence, literally, as he is sent to prison beyond Mega City 1's walls out in the Cursed Earth. He must somehow escape to clear his name and stop Mega City 1 from becoming corrupted by those that framed him. OK, it's hardly brilliant, Schneider irritates, the real thesps in the film are wasted, it lifts from other notable sci-fi movies, so therefore it's lazy, and it has plot holes galore, but is Judge Dredd worthy of the critical mauling it got? Well no, actually. That is if you take it on its own mindless popcorn terms.... The action is fast paced, it's loud and brash, but not in an insulting way like Batman & Robin, Stallone positively plays it dead right with a glint in his eye and chin perfectly chiselled, Lane is sexy as heck-fire in figure hugging futuristic suit, while the production design, the colour toning and the effects (with one exception) are undervalued eye pleasing delights. Add in Assante having the time of his life as villain of the month psycho Rico Dredd, and it's a more than adequate blockbuster. I understand the fan's reactions, those of the comic book that is, because I'm one of them, I treasured my 2000AD and Starlord copies right into my 20s when I foolishly sold them on. This is without doubt a watered down version of Dredd, clearly caught between a fan director's will and a studio's insistence on popcorn munching appeasement. So it's a fact we don't have the ultra violence and general fascist wallop that permeates 2000AD's stiff backed hard bastard, but their are delicate hints of totalitarianism and Nazi overtones in Cannon's movie, whiffs of satire are there as well. It really isn't the directionless adaptation some insist it is. Many flaws for sure, but it makes for a nice companion piece to the better Demolition Man, for that is the bonkers popcorn world it sits in. A guilty pleasure? Well I don't feel guilty about enjoying Judge Dredd a lot, but yes Mr. Fascist, I'm guilty as charged. 6.5/10

    A lot of reviewers turned down this one due to the non-true adaption and the obvious irony plus the "Stallone-type" action style. Well, in fact this movie is extremely entertaining, has a good plot, excellent visuals and give the actors a lot of room and space for their character development. All this makes it better than the recent version of "Dredd". And even that difference between these two movies makes the original Stallone-Version even more better and much more entertaining. Also the violence in the 1995 adaption of the comic is present but does not need any gore to be effective. "Judge Dredd" and "Demolition Man" were true highlights of Stallones action sci-fi period, which unfortunately we not that successful as they probably should have been.

    For the people saying this was the worst movie ever made, get over yourself. The venom of comic book geeks astounds me sometimes, I know because I am one but I pride myself on being able to 'judge' a film on it's own merits. As an adaptation of the comic it is flawed with major points. The now infamous helmet issue seems to be the thing that everyone remembers about the film and Dredd's emotional injection is way off course. The film reeks of studio interference and writers ego when at that time, it was pretty common to stray from the source material for the sake of playing to a certain audience, which was not the fans of the comic. This is the bad! The good is the fact that there is lots of it here. The film looks amazing! The subject has been given the full big budget Hollywood treatment and boy does it show. The sets, scenery effects and make-up are all top quality and really give a great image of a dystopian future. Danny Cannon has a great eye for gorgeous wide shots that really show off an image and it's used to full effect in the film. Mega City one really looks the part and everything bar maybe a few plasticy looking costumes has a real sheen to it! Like it or not, Stallone is perfectly cast as Dredd. He has the physique, the voice and the jaw, it's just a shame that ego got in the way of such a perfect match. The actual film itself, if you are able to pull your head out of your comic book loving arse, is quite honestly a really decent 90's action sci-fi flick. There is lots of excitement and enough to keep anyone occupied for a couple of hours. It does feel however that more could have been explored in the film. Glaring flaws aside Hollywood in the 80's and 90's had a really nasty habit of making a film about a subject matter then writing a story that takes the main character totally out of the norm. This is rectified in the 2012 film where it's just Dredd doing his day to day job and that's what we want. Here Dredd is taken out of his job and thrust into a situation that we just don't want to see him in. At least they kept Rico instead of a generic made up villain and much of the genetic lore of Dredd. If you want a fun action film with a good look to kill an hour or two that Judge Dredd is well worth checking out but if you're looking for authenticity well.....you have the alternative now, so enjoy this for what it is, however an annoyingly missed opportunity it may be!

    As a fan of the comic, this was *dredd*ful. (good one) I own every single one of the comics and was disappointed and unimpressed when I watched this. Problem 1) they got Dredd's helmet wrong. If you are a fan of the comic, Dredd's helmet has a cross across the front. Im so annoyed that they missed this small but distinguishable feature. Problem 2) Dredd is a clone of another judge, and is famous for being a rigid follower of rules. He spares no-one and will carry out punishment as necessary. In this film, he shows too much emotion, which I believed took his authority as 'Dredd' away. Problem 3) They take his helmet off. Why??? You are *not* supposed to see his face! That's the whole point! Maybe i'm over exaggerating, but seriously, that's not good. If you want to understand the point of Judge Dredd without reading all 2000-something comics, see Dredd3d. Thank you. Rant over.

    After watching "Dredd"(2012), I expected less from this movie. But it has all the things I felt the new movie missed. The plot is like one that would be seen in the comic itself. "Dredd" doesn't really utilize much from the comic, besides the setting and characters. But this movie goes above and beyond! Even one of Dredd's classic adversaries is put in the movie! Stallone hits the personality of Judge Dredd dead on, having the serious love of the law while having his occasional comedic moments. "Dredd" is dark, serious, and more gory than Robocop! But this movie, all though not having the best computer animation (it was released in 1995), is a total blast! one of my personal favorites.

    Urban areas have grown into mega-cities that cover entire coastal regions. The justice system has evolved to a single person invested with the power of police, judge, jury, and executioner. Among the Judges of Mega-City One is Dredd, who is one of the best, and a particular favourite of the Head of the Council, Judge Fargo. But there are evil forces at work, block riots and the escape of Rico, a homicidal maniac, are only steps in a plan that ultimately lead to the sentencing of Dredd for a murder he didn't commit. And Dredd must discover the secrets of his own past and survive to stop the evildoers.... Beyond some terrible dialogue, and comic book atrocities, Judge Dredd is simply a summer blockbuster starring an actor whose best years were back in the mid-eighties, which didn't help the film at all. 1995 was a poor year for summer blockbuster. We had Waterworld, Batman Forever, Casper, and of course, Congo. So in all fairness, this is the reason why this film endears me more than others. Stallone is how you would expect, pretty bland, but still a big screen presence whatever the film he's in. And if you were brought up on eighties action, you'll lap it up. The rest of the cast are okay, Lane is a standout, but whatever Assante is on, I really need some. I have never seen a villain so over the top in a movie. Yes, he's supposed to be a psycho and everything, but having literally scream every line and sneer every five minutes is just bonkers. Effects are okay, and Schneider provides unnecessary humour, but all in all it's a big, dumb, fun, summer movie. So what if he takes his helmet off. He was judged.

    Exciting , big-budgeted film dealing with a standard comic book dystopian near-future City where rules fearful judges and happens fantastic events . The source comic book has been a cult favorite in England for thirty years . Loud , spectacular and violent movie set in a future world of urban chaos and based on the comic books by Carlos Ezquerra and John Wagner ; being well adapted by Danny Cannon . In the third Milennium , the futuristic world changed , climate , nations , all were upheaval . The Earth transformed into a poisonous scorched desert , known as &uml;The Cursed Earth&uml;. Millions of people crowed into a few mega Cities where roving bands of street savages created violence the justice system could not control . The Planet Earth has changed into a virtually uninhabitable place . All of the Earth's population have crowded into the cities across the planet , now known as "Mega Cities&uml; . Law as we know it collapsed . From the decay rose a new order whose rule of law is administrated by authorities on motorbikes . A society ruled by a new elite force . A Force with the power to dispense both justice and punishment . They were the police , jury and executioner all in one . They were the judges . Around desert lies Mega City One . It is a violent, futuristic city where a new Justice System came from the ashes , the police has the authority to act as judge, jury and executioner, they were called "Judges" and dispense justice on the riot-torn streets and buildings of Mega City . They fight to control the block riots that over-running the city . The crimes in this "Mega city" became so violent and so powerful, that the regular justice system was powerless to contain, then it collapsed completely . A cop named Dredd , most feared of all , teams with a another judge named Hershey (Diane Lane) to take down criminal gangs , but Dredd is double-crossed and being framed for murder . Dredd fights to clear his name helped by the women-judge and a likable delinquent (Rob Schneider), a renegade misfit named Ferguson , must confront the odds and engage in the relentless battle for their survival . But an escaped convict named Rico (Armand Assante) overtakes the compound's control center and wages a dirty, vicious war against the Judges that proves she will stop at nothing to protect her empire . Rico is an ex-judge who was artificially created and seeks vendetta and power confronting his half-brother , Dredd . Judge Dredd soon released from his imprisonment looks for his genetically contrived evil brother and takes place the final battle . This slam-bang film packs big names , noisy action , thrills , chills , suspense , convoluted screenplay , high body count , loads of massive villains and lots of violence . Some interesting plotting is partially lost in a sea of hard-edge violence , overripe acting , exaggerated explosions and excessive shots . Visually imaginative action Sci-Fi that contains fast and furious fun with echoes of &uml;Metropolis&uml;, &uml;Things to come&uml; and &uml;Blade Runner&uml; . The exciting screenplay throws in Femme cop and a likable inmate , Rob Schneider , who acts as comic relief. The highlights of the movie are a smashing Airbone pursuit on flying motor-bikes and the breathtaking , overwhelming finale . Silvester Stallone's iconic presence is good as a helmeted , emotionless future-cop who dispenses the square jaw-lines and a summary justice. Fizzing visuals , video game-like special effects and impressive production design showing a large megalopolis in &uml;Blade Runner&uml; style . Praiseworthy set design by Nigel Phelps who creates a doleful as well as amazing ghetto City . Atmospheric original music by Alan Silvestri , composed by means of synthesizer . Colorful , though sometimes dark cinematography by Adrian Biddle . The precocious technical mastery displayed by Danny Cannon is spectacular and he delivers narrative fluidity . However , the film failed at box office ; Silvester Stallone , Sly, hoped , in vain , the project would provide him another profitable franchise but it didn't take place . Many years later was shot Dredd 3D (2012) by Pete Travis with Karl Urban , Olivia Thirby and Lena Headley . Rating : 6,5 . Acceptable action film and it will appeal to Stallone enthusiasts and action fans .

    When i was a child i loved this film, having read a lot of Dredd comic books i am a huge fan. I recently watched this film again and cringed at how bad the plot/acting etc was. Rob Schnieder ruins this movie for me. But at the same time it has some fun action and brings me back some happy memories. If you are looking for a good movie with good acting this might not be for you, after all the star is sly Stallone, Although, if you are looking for a fun action film with explosions then give it a go.

    Judge Dredd is directed by Danny Cannon and written by William Wisher Junior and Steven E. de Souza. It stars Sylvester Stallone, Armand Assante, Diane Lane, Rob Schneider, Joan Chen, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and Max von Sydow. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Adrian Biddle. Adapted from the Judge Dredd stories in British comic book 2000AD, the plot finds Stallone as Joseph Judge Dredd, a ruthless law enforcer of the future in Mega City 1. Framed for murder, Dredd finds himself on the other side of the fence, literally, as he is sent to prison beyond Mega City 1's walls out in the Cursed Earth. He must somehow escape to clear his name and stop Mega City 1 from becoming corrupted by those that framed him. OK, it's hardly brilliant, Schneider irritates, the real thesps in the film are wasted, it lifts from other notable sci-fi movies, so therefore it's lazy, and it has plot holes galore, but is Judge Dredd worthy of the critical mauling it got? Well no, actually. That is if you take it on its own mindless popcorn terms.... The action is fast paced, it's loud and brash, but not in an insulting way like Batman & Robin, Stallone positively plays it dead right with a glint in his eye and chin perfectly chiselled, Lane is sexy as heck-fire in figure hugging futuristic suit, while the production design, the colour toning and the effects (with one exception) are undervalued eye pleasing delights. Add in Assante having the time of his life as villain of the month psycho Rico Dredd, and it's a more than adequate blockbuster. I understand the fan's reactions, those of the comic book that is, because I'm one of them, I treasured my 2000AD and Starlord copies right into my 20s when I foolishly sold them on. This is without doubt a watered down version of Dredd, clearly caught between a fan director's will and a studio's insistence on popcorn munching appeasement. So it's a fact we don't have the ultra violence and general fascist wallop that permeates 2000AD's stiff backed hard bastard, but their are delicate hints of totalitarianism and Nazi overtones in Cannon's movie, whiffs of satire are there as well. It really isn't the directionless adaptation some insist it is. Many flaws for sure, but it makes for a nice companion piece to the better Demolition Man, for that is the bonkers popcorn world it sits in. A guilty pleasure? Well I don't feel guilty about enjoying Judge Dredd a lot, but yes Mr. Fascist, I'm guilty as charged. 6.5/10

    i Enjoy Dredd (2012) it was awesome as well even i Love This Movie but it wasn't balls to the wall Action scenes was good and fun but i agree what Stallone said it wasn't balls to wall agree and i did enjoy Judge Dredd movie with Stallone i liked the acting and his anger in movie like new one and i am not judge Dredd comic book reader sorry i am not but i enjoy and love the movies and i haven't read noting to books to it and i know Dredd doesn't take the helmet off that's what people say and never read the book of it i know people got Disappointment about this i didn't i liked it enjoy i am big Fan of Stallone big one and character Rico Dredd (Armand Assante) was pretty much of Psycho Path crazy guy well i know he is bad guy and Rob Schneider was worst in this movie i didn't find him funny in this film he played in 2 Stallone movies in Judge Dredd and Demotion Man but in this as apart from this movie not really that good when he was in Demotion Man he wasn't really part of movie only in 2 parts that's it in this in start and middle and end i really don't want Rob Schneider to be in this movie it was bit silly when he was in it that's why people saying why Rob in this movie ? people say Stallone Cartoon Version i don't find this Cartoon version i think that's how old movies was like that back then this is why Stallone had a bit Problems was this movie in Thirteen years after the release of Judge Dredd, Sylvester Stallone discussed his feelings about the movie in an issue of Uncut magazine in 2008 and he loved that property when I read it, because it took a genre that I love, what you could term the 'action morality film' and made it a bit more sophisticated. It had political overtones. It showed how if we don't curb the way we run our judicial system, the police may end up running our lives. It dealt with archaic governments; it dealt with cloning and all kinds of things that could happen in the future. It was also bigger than any film I've done in its physical stature and the way it was designed. All the people were dwarfed by the system and the architecture; it shows how insignificant human beings could be in the future. There's a lot of action in the movie and some great acting, too. It just wasn't balls to the wall. But I do look back on Judge Dredd as a real missed opportunity. It seemed that lots of fans had a problem with Dredd removing his helmet, because he never does in the comic books. But for me it is more about wasting such great potential there was in that idea, just think of all the opportunities there were to do interesting stuff with the Cursed Earth scenes. It didn't live up to what it could have been. It probably should have been much more comic, really humorous, and fun. What I learned out of that experience was that we shouldn't have tried to make it Hamlet; it's more Hamlet and Eggs that's what he said the film director for me was idiot Judge Dredd doesn't take out his Hamlet i agree maybe the director said F**ck his idea then the director did his own so he thinks Judge Dredd Fans people might think it's going to be great but you know what you didn't do it well i like movie like i said i love Action scenes him fighting with Rico was awesome and motorbike flying Motorbike and cops chasing Stallone was awesome start is Kinda Same as Dredd (2012) in Apartment shooting kinda same but 2 different movies but in Judge Dredd (1995) was kinda same at start in Apartment shoot out then in Dredd in awesome movie different not remake more of restart like batman Begins but different movies so Judge Dredd awesome and Dredd 2012 awesome both different movies if your a Stallone fan or Judge Dredd witch ones would you like better then first watch this one don't listen to fans they read comic books they comic book reader me i am not i am watch movies so yeah i enjoy this movie 10/10 for Sylvester Stallone

    It could have been Robocop" of the 90's . Instead we have a popcorn movie . The 90's weren't exactly the best time for comic book movies , but still this one has managed to be a decent one. Especially compared to Schumacher's Batman movies. I can't say I'm an expert when it comes to Dredd , but I read few comics about him and they were nice. Stallone is kinda wasted here as the main hero . He is able to play cold blooded , silent and gloomy character . He proved that in "Cobra". The authors too easily allow him to play just himself , not Dredd. Still , he's not bad in his role despite popular opinion . Even he's chin looks just like the chin of comic book Dredd. Max von Sydow , Jurgen Prochnow and Diane Lane all give nice performances and some depth to their characters . Watch out for Liev Schreiber in a small role of young academy judge . Also , Joan Chen makes an appearance . God knows why . There only reason is that they wanted to put a catfight into movie. Unfortunately , there are also two really bad performances that almost destroy the whole movie. Armand Assante who plays the villain, overacts through THE WHOLE MOVIE. He's shouting , smiling evil smiles and making big eyes so often he really is worse than a cartoon villain. Let's not forget about Rob Schneider  one of the most pathetic comediants alive. He's so annoying I wanted to kill him . He says a one funny thing through whole movie - "We don't have time for this" and gives a great parody of Stallone's voice . Except that he's AWFUL. I wonder if Stallone really needed a sidekick , since he does have a few funny one-liners himself. The upbeat music by Alan Silvestri is nice . So is the art-direction . The whole city looks EXACTLY like in the comics . The special effects are little dated in some places , but not bad. The movie pretends to asks some important questions about cloning or how to fight with evil , but only pretends . Too bad . In good hands it could be a good serious science fiction just like "Robocop". Stallone's other movie "The Demolition man " is much better. It doesn't mean this one isn't watchable. I give it 5/10.

    Urban areas have grown into mega-cities that cover entire coastal regions. The justice system has evolved to a single person invested with the power of police, judge, jury, and executioner. Among the Judges of Mega-City One is Dredd, who is one of the best, and a particular favourite of the Head of the Council, Judge Fargo. But there are evil forces at work, block riots and the escape of Rico, a homicidal maniac, are only steps in a plan that ultimately lead to the sentencing of Dredd for a murder he didn't commit. And Dredd must discover the secrets of his own past and survive to stop the evildoers....

    When i was a child i loved this film, having read a lot of Dredd comic books i am a huge fan. I recently watched this film again and cringed at how bad the plot/acting etc was. Rob Schnieder ruins this movie for me. But at the same time it has some fun action and brings me back some happy memories. If you are looking for a good movie with good acting this might not be for you, after all the star is sly Stallone, Although, if you are looking for a fun action film with explosions then give it a go.

    Judge Dredd is directed by Danny Cannon and written by William Wisher Junior and Steven E. de Souza. It stars Sylvester Stallone, Armand Assante, Diane Lane, Rob Schneider, Joan Chen, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and Max von Sydow. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Adrian Biddle. Adapted from the Judge Dredd stories in British comic book 2000AD, the plot finds Stallone as Joseph Judge Dredd, a ruthless law enforcer of the future in Mega City 1. Framed for murder, Dredd finds himself on the other side of the fence, literally, as he is sent to prison beyond Mega City 1's walls out in the Cursed Earth. He must somehow escape to clear his name and stop Mega City 1 from becoming corrupted by those that framed him. OK, it's hardly brilliant, Schneider irritates, the real thesps in the film are wasted, it lifts from other notable sci-fi movies, so therefore it's lazy, and it has plot holes galore, but is Judge Dredd worthy of the critical mauling it got? Well no, actually. That is if you take it on its own mindless popcorn terms.... The action is fast paced, it's loud and brash, but not in an insulting way like Batman & Robin, Stallone positively plays it dead right with a glint in his eye and chin perfectly chiselled, Lane is sexy as heck-fire in figure hugging futuristic suit, while the production design, the colour toning and the effects (with one exception) are undervalued eye pleasing delights. Add in Assante having the time of his life as villain of the month psycho Rico Dredd, and it's a more than adequate blockbuster. I understand the fan's reactions, those of the comic book that is, because I'm one of them, I treasured my 2000AD and Starlord copies right into my 20s when I foolishly sold them on. This is without doubt a watered down version of Dredd, clearly caught between a fan director's will and a studio's insistence on popcorn munching appeasement. So it's a fact we don't have the ultra violence and general fascist wallop that permeates 2000AD's stiff backed hard bastard, but their are delicate hints of totalitarianism and Nazi overtones in Cannon's movie, whiffs of satire are there as well. It really isn't the directionless adaptation some insist it is. Many flaws for sure, but it makes for a nice companion piece to the better Demolition Man, for that is the bonkers popcorn world it sits in. A guilty pleasure? Well I don't feel guilty about enjoying Judge Dredd a lot, but yes Mr. Fascist, I'm guilty as charged. 6.5/10

    i Enjoy Dredd (2012) it was awesome as well even i Love This Movie but it wasn't balls to the wall Action scenes was good and fun but i agree what Stallone said it wasn't balls to wall agree and i did enjoy Judge Dredd movie with Stallone i liked the acting and his anger in movie like new one and i am not judge Dredd comic book reader sorry i am not but i enjoy and love the movies and i haven't read noting to books to it and i know Dredd doesn't take the helmet off that's what people say and never read the book of it i know people got Disappointment about this i didn't i liked it enjoy i am big Fan of Stallone big one and character Rico Dredd (Armand Assante) was pretty much of Psycho Path crazy guy well i know he is bad guy and Rob Schneider was worst in this movie i didn't find him funny in this film he played in 2 Stallone movies in Judge Dredd and Demotion Man but in this as apart from this movie not really that good when he was in Demotion Man he wasn't really part of movie only in 2 parts that's it in this in start and middle and end i really don't want Rob Schneider to be in this movie it was bit silly when he was in it that's why people saying why Rob in this movie ? people say Stallone Cartoon Version i don't find this Cartoon version i think that's how old movies was like that back then this is why Stallone had a bit Problems was this movie in Thirteen years after the release of Judge Dredd, Sylvester Stallone discussed his feelings about the movie in an issue of Uncut magazine in 2008 and he loved that property when I read it, because it took a genre that I love, what you could term the 'action morality film' and made it a bit more sophisticated. It had political overtones. It showed how if we don't curb the way we run our judicial system, the police may end up running our lives. It dealt with archaic governments; it dealt with cloning and all kinds of things that could happen in the future. It was also bigger than any film I've done in its physical stature and the way it was designed. All the people were dwarfed by the system and the architecture; it shows how insignificant human beings could be in the future. There's a lot of action in the movie and some great acting, too. It just wasn't balls to the wall. But I do look back on Judge Dredd as a real missed opportunity. It seemed that lots of fans had a problem with Dredd removing his helmet, because he never does in the comic books. But for me it is more about wasting such great potential there was in that idea, just think of all the opportunities there were to do interesting stuff with the Cursed Earth scenes. It didn't live up to what it could have been. It probably should have been much more comic, really humorous, and fun. What I learned out of that experience was that we shouldn't have tried to make it Hamlet; it's more Hamlet and Eggs that's what he said the film director for me was idiot Judge Dredd doesn't take out his Hamlet i agree maybe the director said F**ck his idea then the director did his own so he thinks Judge Dredd Fans people might think it's going to be great but you know what you didn't do it well i like movie like i said i love Action scenes him fighting with Rico was awesome and motorbike flying Motorbike and cops chasing Stallone was awesome start is Kinda Same as Dredd (2012) in Apartment shooting kinda same but 2 different movies but in Judge Dredd (1995) was kinda same at start in Apartment shoot out then in Dredd in awesome movie different not remake more of restart like batman Begins but different movies so Judge Dredd awesome and Dredd 2012 awesome both different movies if your a Stallone fan or Judge Dredd witch ones would you like better then first watch this one don't listen to fans they read comic books they comic book reader me i am not i am watch movies so yeah i enjoy this movie 10/10 for Sylvester Stallone

    It could have been Robocop" of the 90's . Instead we have a popcorn movie . The 90's weren't exactly the best time for comic book movies , but still this one has managed to be a decent one. Especially compared to Schumacher's Batman movies. I can't say I'm an expert when it comes to Dredd , but I read few comics about him and they were nice. Stallone is kinda wasted here as the main hero . He is able to play cold blooded , silent and gloomy character . He proved that in "Cobra". The authors too easily allow him to play just himself , not Dredd. Still , he's not bad in his role despite popular opinion . Even he's chin looks just like the chin of comic book Dredd. Max von Sydow , Jurgen Prochnow and Diane Lane all give nice performances and some depth to their characters . Watch out for Liev Schreiber in a small role of young academy judge . Also , Joan Chen makes an appearance . God knows why . There only reason is that they wanted to put a catfight into movie. Unfortunately , there are also two really bad performances that almost destroy the whole movie. Armand Assante who plays the villain, overacts through THE WHOLE MOVIE. He's shouting , smiling evil smiles and making big eyes so often he really is worse than a cartoon villain. Let's not forget about Rob Schneider  one of the most pathetic comediants alive. He's so annoying I wanted to kill him . He says a one funny thing through whole movie - "We don't have time for this" and gives a great parody of Stallone's voice . Except that he's AWFUL. I wonder if Stallone really needed a sidekick , since he does have a few funny one-liners himself. The upbeat music by Alan Silvestri is nice . So is the art-direction . The whole city looks EXACTLY like in the comics . The special effects are little dated in some places , but not bad. The movie pretends to asks some important questions about cloning or how to fight with evil , but only pretends . Too bad . In good hands it could be a good serious science fiction just like "Robocop". Stallone's other movie "The Demolition man " is much better. It doesn't mean this one isn't watchable. I give it 5/10.

    A lot of reviewers turned down this one due to the non-true adaption and the obvious irony plus the "Stallone-type" action style. Well, in fact this movie is extremely entertaining, has a good plot, excellent visuals and give the actors a lot of room and space for their character development. All this makes it better than the recent version of "Dredd". And even that difference between these two movies makes the original Stallone-Version even more better and much more entertaining. Also the violence in the 1995 adaption of the comic is present but does not need any gore to be effective. "Judge Dredd" and "Demolition Man" were true highlights of Stallones action sci-fi period, which unfortunately we not that successful as they probably should have been.

    For the people saying this was the worst movie ever made, get over yourself. The venom of comic book geeks astounds me sometimes, I know because I am one but I pride myself on being able to 'judge' a film on it's own merits. As an adaptation of the comic it is flawed with major points. The now infamous helmet issue seems to be the thing that everyone remembers about the film and Dredd's emotional injection is way off course. The film reeks of studio interference and writers ego when at that time, it was pretty common to stray from the source material for the sake of playing to a certain audience, which was not the fans of the comic. This is the bad! The good is the fact that there is lots of it here. The film looks amazing! The subject has been given the full big budget Hollywood treatment and boy does it show. The sets, scenery effects and make-up are all top quality and really give a great image of a dystopian future. Danny Cannon has a great eye for gorgeous wide shots that really show off an image and it's used to full effect in the film. Mega City one really looks the part and everything bar maybe a few plasticy looking costumes has a real sheen to it! Like it or not, Stallone is perfectly cast as Dredd. He has the physique, the voice and the jaw, it's just a shame that ego got in the way of such a perfect match. The actual film itself, if you are able to pull your head out of your comic book loving arse, is quite honestly a really decent 90's action sci-fi flick. There is lots of excitement and enough to keep anyone occupied for a couple of hours. It does feel however that more could have been explored in the film. Glaring flaws aside Hollywood in the 80's and 90's had a really nasty habit of making a film about a subject matter then writing a story that takes the main character totally out of the norm. This is rectified in the 2012 film where it's just Dredd doing his day to day job and that's what we want. Here Dredd is taken out of his job and thrust into a situation that we just don't want to see him in. At least they kept Rico instead of a generic made up villain and much of the genetic lore of Dredd. If you want a fun action film with a good look to kill an hour or two that Judge Dredd is well worth checking out but if you're looking for authenticity well.....you have the alternative now, so enjoy this for what it is, however an annoyingly missed opportunity it may be!

    As a fan of the comic, this was *dredd*ful. (good one) I own every single one of the comics and was disappointed and unimpressed when I watched this. Problem 1) they got Dredd's helmet wrong. If you are a fan of the comic, Dredd's helmet has a cross across the front. Im so annoyed that they missed this small but distinguishable feature. Problem 2) Dredd is a clone of another judge, and is famous for being a rigid follower of rules. He spares no-one and will carry out punishment as necessary. In this film, he shows too much emotion, which I believed took his authority as 'Dredd' away. Problem 3) They take his helmet off. Why??? You are *not* supposed to see his face! That's the whole point! Maybe i'm over exaggerating, but seriously, that's not good. If you want to understand the point of Judge Dredd without reading all 2000-something comics, see Dredd3d. Thank you. Rant over.

    After watching "Dredd"(2012), I expected less from this movie. But it has all the things I felt the new movie missed. The plot is like one that would be seen in the comic itself. "Dredd" doesn't really utilize much from the comic, besides the setting and characters. But this movie goes above and beyond! Even one of Dredd's classic adversaries is put in the movie! Stallone hits the personality of Judge Dredd dead on, having the serious love of the law while having his occasional comedic moments. "Dredd" is dark, serious, and more gory than Robocop! But this movie, all though not having the best computer animation (it was released in 1995), is a total blast! one of my personal favorites.

    Urban areas have grown into mega-cities that cover entire coastal regions. The justice system has evolved to a single person invested with the power of police, judge, jury, and executioner. Among the Judges of Mega-City One is Dredd, who is one of the best, and a particular favourite of the Head of the Council, Judge Fargo. But there are evil forces at work, block riots and the escape of Rico, a homicidal maniac, are only steps in a plan that ultimately lead to the sentencing of Dredd for a murder he didn't commit. And Dredd must discover the secrets of his own past and survive to stop the evildoers.... Beyond some terrible dialogue, and comic book atrocities, Judge Dredd is simply a summer blockbuster starring an actor whose best years were back in the mid-eighties, which didn't help the film at all. 1995 was a poor year for summer blockbuster. We had Waterworld, Batman Forever, Casper, and of course, Congo. So in all fairness, this is the reason why this film endears me more than others. Stallone is how you would expect, pretty bland, but still a big screen presence whatever the film he's in. And if you were brought up on eighties action, you'll lap it up. The rest of the cast are okay, Lane is a standout, but whatever Assante is on, I really need some. I have never seen a villain so over the top in a movie. Yes, he's supposed to be a psycho and everything, but having literally scream every line and sneer every five minutes is just bonkers. Effects are okay, and Schneider provides unnecessary humour, but all in all it's a big, dumb, fun, summer movie. So what if he takes his helmet off. He was judged.

It had political overtones. It showed how if we don't curb the way we run our judicial system, the police may end up running our lives. It dealt with archaic governments; it dealt with cloning and all kinds of things that could happen in the future. It was also bigger than any film I've done in its physical stature and the way it was designed. All the people were dwarfed by the system and the architecture; it shows how insignificant human beings could be in the future. There's a lot of action in the movie and some great acting, too. It just wasn't balls to the wall. But I do look back on Judge Dredd as a real missed opportunity. It seemed that lots of fans had a problem with Dredd removing his helmet, because he never does in the comic books. But for me it is more about wasting such great potential there was in that idea, just think of all the opportunities there were to do interesting stuff with the Cursed Earth scenes. It didn't live up to what it could have been. It probably should have been much more comic, really humorous, and fun. What I learned out of that experience was that we shouldn't have tried to make it Hamlet; it's more Hamlet and Eggs that's what he said the film director for me was idiot Judge Dredd doesn't take out his Hamlet i agree maybe the director said F**ck his idea then the director did his own so he thinks Judge Dredd Fans people might think it's going to be great but you know what you didn't do it well i like movie like i said i love Action scenes him fighting with Rico was awesome and motorbike flying Motorbike and cops chasing Stallone was awesome start is Kinda Same as Dredd (2012) in Apartment shooting kinda same but 2 different movies but in Judge Dredd (1995) was kinda same at start in Apartment shoot out then in Dredd in awesome movie different not remake more of restart like batman Begins but different movies so Judge Dredd awesome and Dredd 2012 awesome both different movies if your a Stallone fan or Judge Dredd witch ones would you like better then first watch this one don't listen to fans they read comic books they comic book reader me i am not i am watch movies so yeah i enjoy this movie 10/10 for Sylvester Stallone

    It could have been Robocop" of the 90's . Instead we have a popcorn movie . The 90's weren't exactly the best time for comic book movies , but still this one has managed to be a decent one. Especially compared to Schumacher's Batman movies. I can't say I'm an expert when it comes to Dredd , but I read few comics about him and they were nice. Stallone is kinda wasted here as the main hero . He is able to play cold blooded , silent and gloomy character . He proved that in "Cobra". The authors too easily allow him to play just himself , not Dredd. Still , he's not bad in his role despite popular opinion . Even he's chin looks just like the chin of comic book Dredd. Max von Sydow , Jurgen Prochnow and Diane Lane all give nice performances and some depth to their characters . Watch out for Liev Schreiber in a small role of young academy judge . Also , Joan Chen makes an appearance . God knows why . There only reason is that they wanted to put a catfight into movie. Unfortunately , there are also two really bad performances that almost destroy the whole movie. Armand Assante who plays the villain, overacts through THE WHOLE MOVIE. He's shouting , smiling evil smiles and making big eyes so often he really is worse than a cartoon villain. Let's not forget about Rob Schneider  one of the most pathetic comediants alive. He's so annoying I wanted to kill him . He says a one funny thing through whole movie - "We don't have time for this" and gives a great parody of Stallone's voice . Except that he's AWFUL. I wonder if Stallone really needed a sidekick , since he does have a few funny one-liners himself. The upbeat music by Alan Silvestri is nice . So is the art-direction . The whole city looks EXACTLY like in the comics . The special effects are little dated in some places , but not bad. The movie pretends to asks some important questions about cloning or how to fight with evil , but only pretends . Too bad . In good hands it could be a good serious science fiction just like "Robocop". Stallone's other movie "The Demolition man " is much better. It doesn't mean this one isn't watchable. I give it 5/10.

    A lot of reviewers turned down this one due to the non-true adaption and the obvious irony plus the "Stallone-type" action style. Well, in fact this movie is extremely entertaining, has a good plot, excellent visuals and give the actors a lot of room and space for their character development. All this makes it better than the recent version of "Dredd". And even that difference between these two movies makes the original Stallone-Version even more better and much more entertaining. Also the violence in the 1995 adaption of the comic is present but does not need any gore to be effective. "Judge Dredd" and "Demolition Man" were true highlights of Stallones action sci-fi period, which unfortunately we not that successful as they probably should have been.

    For the people saying this was the worst movie ever made, get over yourself. The venom of comic book geeks astounds me sometimes, I know because I am one but I pride myself on being able to 'judge' a film on it's own merits. As an adaptation of the comic it is flawed with major points. The now infamous helmet issue seems to be the thing that everyone remembers about the film and Dredd's emotional injection is way off course. The film reeks of studio interference and writers ego when at that time, it was pretty common to stray from the source material for the sake of playing to a certain audience, which was not the fans of the comic. This is the bad! The good is the fact that there is lots of it here. The film looks amazing! The subject has been given the full big budget Hollywood treatment and boy does it show. The sets, scenery effects and make-up are all top quality and really give a great image of a dystopian future. Danny Cannon has a great eye for gorgeous wide shots that really show off an image and it's used to full effect in the film. Mega City one really looks the part and everything bar maybe a few plasticy looking costumes has a real sheen to it! Like it or not, Stallone is perfectly cast as Dredd. He has the physique, the voice and the jaw, it's just a shame that ego got in the way of such a perfect match. The actual film itself, if you are able to pull your head out of your comic book loving arse, is quite honestly a really decent 90's action sci-fi flick. There is lots of excitement and enough to keep anyone occupied for a couple of hours. It does feel however that more could have been explored in the film. Glaring flaws aside Hollywood in the 80's and 90's had a really nasty habit of making a film about a subject matter then writing a story that takes the main character totally out of the norm. This is rectified in the 2012 film where it's just Dredd doing his day to day job and that's what we want. Here Dredd is taken out of his job and thrust into a situation that we just don't want to see him in. At least they kept Rico instead of a generic made up villain and much of the genetic lore of Dredd. If you want a fun action film with a good look to kill an hour or two that Judge Dredd is well worth checking out but if you're looking for authenticity well.....you have the alternative now, so enjoy this for what it is, however an annoyingly missed opportunity it may be!

    As a fan of the comic, this was *dredd*ful. (good one) I own every single one of the comics and was disappointed and unimpressed when I watched this. Problem 1) they got Dredd's helmet wrong. If you are a fan of the comic, Dredd's helmet has a cross across the front. Im so annoyed that they missed this small but distinguishable feature. Problem 2) Dredd is a clone of another judge, and is famous for being a rigid follower of rules. He spares no-one and will carry out punishment as necessary. In this film, he shows too much emotion, which I believed took his authority as 'Dredd' away. Problem 3) They take his helmet off. Why??? You are *not* supposed to see his face! That's the whole point! Maybe i'm over exaggerating, but seriously, that's not good. If you want to understand the point of Judge Dredd without reading all 2000-something comics, see Dredd3d. Thank you. Rant over.

    After watching "Dredd"(2012), I expected less from this movie. But it has all the things I felt the new movie missed. The plot is like one that would be seen in the comic itself. "Dredd" doesn't really utilize much from the comic, besides the setting and characters. But this movie goes above and beyond! Even one of Dredd's classic adversaries is put in the movie! Stallone hits the personality of Judge Dredd dead on, having the serious love of the law while having his occasional comedic moments. "Dredd" is dark, serious, and more gory than Robocop! But this movie, all though not having the best computer animation (it was released in 1995), is a total blast! one of my personal favorites.

    Urban areas have grown into mega-cities that cover entire coastal regions. The justice system has evolved to a single person invested with the power of police, judge, jury, and executioner. Among the Judges of Mega-City One is Dredd, who is one of the best, and a particular favourite of the Head of the Council, Judge Fargo. But there are evil forces at work, block riots and the escape of Rico, a homicidal maniac, are only steps in a plan that ultimately lead to the sentencing of Dredd for a murder he didn't commit. And Dredd must discover the secrets of his own past and survive to stop the evildoers.... Beyond some terrible dialogue, and comic book atrocities, Judge Dredd is simply a summer blockbuster starring an actor whose best years were back in the mid-eighties, which didn't help the film at all. 1995 was a poor year for summer blockbuster. We had Waterworld, Batman Forever, Casper, and of course, Congo. So in all fairness, this is the reason why this film endears me more than others. Stallone is how you would expect, pretty bland, but still a big screen presence whatever the film he's in. And if you were brought up on eighties action, you'll lap it up. The rest of the cast are okay, Lane is a standout, but whatever Assante is on, I really need some. I have never seen a villain so over the top in a movie. Yes, he's supposed to be a psycho and everything, but having literally scream every line and sneer every five minutes is just bonkers. Effects are okay, and Schneider provides unnecessary humour, but all in all it's a big, dumb, fun, summer movie. So what if he takes his helmet off. He was judged.

    Exciting , big-budgeted film dealing with a standard comic book dystopian near-future City where rules fearful judges and happens fantastic events . The source comic book has been a cult favorite in England for thirty years . Loud , spectacular and violent movie set in a future world of urban chaos and based on the comic books by Carlos Ezquerra and John Wagner ; being well adapted by Danny Cannon . In the third Milennium , the futuristic world changed , climate , nations , all were upheaval . The Earth transformed into a poisonous scorched desert , known as &uml;The Cursed Earth&uml;. Millions of people crowed into a few mega Cities where roving bands of street savages created violence the justice system could not control . The Planet Earth has changed into a virtually uninhabitable place . All of the Earth's population have crowded into the cities across the planet , now known as "Mega Cities&uml; . Law as we know it collapsed . From the decay rose a new order whose rule of law is administrated by authorities on motorbikes . A society ruled by a new elite force . A Force with the power to dispense both justice and punishment . They were the police , jury and executioner all in one . They were the judges . Around desert lies Mega City One . It is a violent, futuristic city where a new Justice System came from the ashes , the police has the authority to act as judge, jury and executioner, they were called "Judges" and dispense justice on the riot-torn streets and buildings of Mega City . They fight to control the block riots that over-running the city . The crimes in this "Mega city" became so violent and so powerful, that the regular justice system was powerless to contain, then it collapsed completely . A cop named Dredd , most feared of all , teams with a another judge named Hershey (Diane Lane) to take down criminal gangs , but Dredd is double-crossed and being framed for murder . Dredd fights to clear his name helped by the women-judge and a likable delinquent (Rob Schneider), a renegade misfit named Ferguson , must confront the odds and engage in the relentless battle for their survival . But an escaped convict named Rico (Armand Assante) overtakes the compound's control center and wages a dirty, vicious war against the Judges that proves she will stop at nothing to protect her empire . Rico is an ex-judge who was artificially created and seeks vendetta and power confronting his half-brother , Dredd . Judge Dredd soon released from his imprisonment looks for his genetically contrived evil brother and takes place the final battle . This slam-bang film packs big names , noisy action , thrills , chills , suspense , convoluted screenplay , high body count , loads of massive villains and lots of violence . Some interesting plotting is partially lost in a sea of hard-edge violence , overripe acting , exaggerated explosions and excessive shots . Visually imaginative action Sci-Fi that contains fast and furious fun with echoes of &uml;Metropolis&uml;, &uml;Things to come&uml; and &uml;Blade Runner&uml; . The exciting screenplay throws in Femme cop and a likable inmate , Rob Schneider , who acts as comic relief. The highlights of the movie are a smashing Airbone pursuit on flying motor-bikes and the breathtaking , overwhelming finale . Silvester Stallone's iconic presence is good as a helmeted , emotionless future-cop who dispenses the square jaw-lines and a summary justice. Fizzing visuals , video game-like special effects and impressive production design showing a large megalopolis in &uml;Blade Runner&uml; style . Praiseworthy set design by Nigel Phelps who creates a doleful as well as amazing ghetto City . Atmospheric original music by Alan Silvestri , composed by means of synthesizer . Colorful , though sometimes dark cinematography by Adrian Biddle . The precocious technical mastery displayed by Danny Cannon is spectacular and he delivers narrative fluidity . However , the film failed at box office ; Silvester Stallone , Sly, hoped , in vain , the project would provide him another profitable franchise but it didn't take place . Many years later was shot Dredd 3D (2012) by Pete Travis with Karl Urban , Olivia Thirby and Lena Headley . Rating : 6,5 . Acceptable action film and it will appeal to Stallone enthusiasts and action fans .

    When i was a child i loved this film, having read a lot of Dredd comic books i am a huge fan. I recently watched this film again and cringed at how bad the plot/acting etc was. Rob Schnieder ruins this movie for me. But at the same time it has some fun action and brings me back some happy memories. If you are looking for a good movie with good acting this might not be for you, after all the star is sly Stallone, Although, if you are looking for a fun action film with explosions then give it a go.

    Judge Dredd is directed by Danny Cannon and written by William Wisher Junior and Steven E. de Souza. It stars Sylvester Stallone, Armand Assante, Diane Lane, Rob Schneider, Joan Chen, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and Max von Sydow. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Adrian Biddle. Adapted from the Judge Dredd stories in British comic book 2000AD, the plot finds Stallone as Joseph Judge Dredd, a ruthless law enforcer of the future in Mega City 1. Framed for murder, Dredd finds himself on the other side of the fence, literally, as he is sent to prison beyond Mega City 1's walls out in the Cursed Earth. He must somehow escape to clear his name and stop Mega City 1 from becoming corrupted by those that framed him. OK, it's hardly brilliant, Schneider irritates, the real thesps in the film are wasted, it lifts from other notable sci-fi movies, so therefore it's lazy, and it has plot holes galore, but is Judge Dredd worthy of the critical mauling it got? Well no, actually. That is if you take it on its own mindless popcorn terms.... The action is fast paced, it's loud and brash, but not in an insulting way like Batman & Robin, Stallone positively plays it dead right with a glint in his eye and chin perfectly chiselled, Lane is sexy as heck-fire in figure hugging futuristic suit, while the production design, the colour toning and the effects (with one exception) are undervalued eye pleasing delights. Add in Assante having the time of his life as villain of the month psycho Rico Dredd, and it's a more than adequate blockbuster. I understand the fan's reactions, those of the comic book that is, because I'm one of them, I treasured my 2000AD and Starlord copies right into my 20s when I foolishly sold them on. This is without doubt a watered down version of Dredd, clearly caught between a fan director's will and a studio's insistence on popcorn munching appeasement. So it's a fact we don't have the ultra violence and general fascist wallop that permeates 2000AD's stiff backed hard bastard, but their are delicate hints of totalitarianism and Nazi overtones in Cannon's movie, whiffs of satire are there as well. It really isn't the directionless adaptation some insist it is. Many flaws for sure, but it makes for a nice companion piece to the better Demolition Man, for that is the bonkers popcorn world it sits in. A guilty pleasure? Well I don't feel guilty about enjoying Judge Dredd a lot, but yes Mr. Fascist, I'm guilty as charged. 6.5/10

Glaring flaws aside Hollywood in the 80's and 90's had a really nasty habit of making a film about a subject matter then writing a story that takes the main character totally out of the norm. This is rectified in the 2012 film where it's just Dredd doing his day to day job and that's what we want. Here Dredd is taken out of his job and thrust into a situation that we just don't want to see him in. At least they kept Rico instead of a generic made up villain and much of the genetic lore of Dredd. If you want a fun action film with a good look to kill an hour or two that Judge Dredd is well worth checking out but if you're looking for authenticity well.....you have the alternative now, so enjoy this for what it is, however an annoyingly missed opportunity it may be!

    As a fan of the comic, this was *dredd*ful. (good one) I own every single one of the comics and was disappointed and unimpressed when I watched this. Problem 1) they got Dredd's helmet wrong. If you are a fan of the comic, Dredd's helmet has a cross across the front. Im so annoyed that they missed this small but distinguishable feature. Problem 2) Dredd is a clone of another judge, and is famous for being a rigid follower of rules. He spares no-one and will carry out punishment as necessary. In this film, he shows too much emotion, which I believed took his authority as 'Dredd' away. Problem 3) They take his helmet off. Why??? You are *not* supposed to see his face! That's the whole point! Maybe i'm over exaggerating, but seriously, that's not good. If you want to understand the point of Judge Dredd without reading all 2000-something comics, see Dredd3d. Thank you. Rant over.

    After watching "Dredd"(2012), I expected less from this movie. But it has all the things I felt the new movie missed. The plot is like one that would be seen in the comic itself. "Dredd" doesn't really utilize much from the comic, besides the setting and characters. But this movie goes above and beyond! Even one of Dredd's classic adversaries is put in the movie! Stallone hits the personality of Judge Dredd dead on, having the serious love of the law while having his occasional comedic moments. "Dredd" is dark, serious, and more gory than Robocop! But this movie, all though not having the best computer animation (it was released in 1995), is a total blast! one of my personal favorites.

    Urban areas have grown into mega-cities that cover entire coastal regions. The justice system has evolved to a single person invested with the power of police, judge, jury, and executioner. Among the Judges of Mega-City One is Dredd, who is one of the best, and a particular favourite of the Head of the Council, Judge Fargo. But there are evil forces at work, block riots and the escape of Rico, a homicidal maniac, are only steps in a plan that ultimately lead to the sentencing of Dredd for a murder he didn't commit. And Dredd must discover the secrets of his own past and survive to stop the evildoers.... Beyond some terrible dialogue, and comic book atrocities, Judge Dredd is simply a summer blockbuster starring an actor whose best years were back in the mid-eighties, which didn't help the film at all. 1995 was a poor year for summer blockbuster. We had Waterworld, Batman Forever, Casper, and of course, Congo. So in all fairness, this is the reason why this film endears me more than others. Stallone is how you would expect, pretty bland, but still a big screen presence whatever the film he's in. And if you were brought up on eighties action, you'll lap it up. The rest of the cast are okay, Lane is a standout, but whatever Assante is on, I really need some. I have never seen a villain so over the top in a movie. Yes, he's supposed to be a psycho and everything, but having literally scream every line and sneer every five minutes is just bonkers. Effects are okay, and Schneider provides unnecessary humour, but all in all it's a big, dumb, fun, summer movie. So what if he takes his helmet off. He was judged.

    Exciting , big-budgeted film dealing with a standard comic book dystopian near-future City where rules fearful judges and happens fantastic events . The source comic book has been a cult favorite in England for thirty years . Loud , spectacular and violent movie set in a future world of urban chaos and based on the comic books by Carlos Ezquerra and John Wagner ; being well adapted by Danny Cannon . In the third Milennium , the futuristic world changed , climate , nations , all were upheaval . The Earth transformed into a poisonous scorched desert , known as &uml;The Cursed Earth&uml;. Millions of people crowed into a few mega Cities where roving bands of street savages created violence the justice system could not control . The Planet Earth has changed into a virtually uninhabitable place . All of the Earth's population have crowded into the cities across the planet , now known as "Mega Cities&uml; . Law as we know it collapsed . From the decay rose a new order whose rule of law is administrated by authorities on motorbikes . A society ruled by a new elite force . A Force with the power to dispense both justice and punishment . They were the police , jury and executioner all in one . They were the judges . Around desert lies Mega City One . It is a violent, futuristic city where a new Justice System came from the ashes , the police has the authority to act as judge, jury and executioner, they were called "Judges" and dispense justice on the riot-torn streets and buildings of Mega City . They fight to control the block riots that over-running the city . The crimes in this "Mega city" became so violent and so powerful, that the regular justice system was powerless to contain, then it collapsed completely . A cop named Dredd , most feared of all , teams with a another judge named Hershey (Diane Lane) to take down criminal gangs , but Dredd is double-crossed and being framed for murder . Dredd fights to clear his name helped by the women-judge and a likable delinquent (Rob Schneider), a renegade misfit named Ferguson , must confront the odds and engage in the relentless battle for their survival . But an escaped convict named Rico (Armand Assante) overtakes the compound's control center and wages a dirty, vicious war against the Judges that proves she will stop at nothing to protect her empire . Rico is an ex-judge who was artificially created and seeks vendetta and power confronting his half-brother , Dredd . Judge Dredd soon released from his imprisonment looks for his genetically contrived evil brother and takes place the final battle . This slam-bang film packs big names , noisy action , thrills , chills , suspense , convoluted screenplay , high body count , loads of massive villains and lots of violence . Some interesting plotting is partially lost in a sea of hard-edge violence , overripe acting , exaggerated explosions and excessive shots . Visually imaginative action Sci-Fi that contains fast and furious fun with echoes of &uml;Metropolis&uml;, &uml;Things to come&uml; and &uml;Blade Runner&uml; . The exciting screenplay throws in Femme cop and a likable inmate , Rob Schneider , who acts as comic relief. The highlights of the movie are a smashing Airbone pursuit on flying motor-bikes and the breathtaking , overwhelming finale . Silvester Stallone's iconic presence is good as a helmeted , emotionless future-cop who dispenses the square jaw-lines and a summary justice. Fizzing visuals , video game-like special effects and impressive production design showing a large megalopolis in &uml;Blade Runner&uml; style . Praiseworthy set design by Nigel Phelps who creates a doleful as well as amazing ghetto City . Atmospheric original music by Alan Silvestri , composed by means of synthesizer . Colorful , though sometimes dark cinematography by Adrian Biddle . The precocious technical mastery displayed by Danny Cannon is spectacular and he delivers narrative fluidity . However , the film failed at box office ; Silvester Stallone , Sly, hoped , in vain , the project would provide him another profitable franchise but it didn't take place . Many years later was shot Dredd 3D (2012) by Pete Travis with Karl Urban , Olivia Thirby and Lena Headley . Rating : 6,5 . Acceptable action film and it will appeal to Stallone enthusiasts and action fans .

    When i was a child i loved this film, having read a lot of Dredd comic books i am a huge fan. I recently watched this film again and cringed at how bad the plot/acting etc was. Rob Schnieder ruins this movie for me. But at the same time it has some fun action and brings me back some happy memories. If you are looking for a good movie with good acting this might not be for you, after all the star is sly Stallone, Although, if you are looking for a fun action film with explosions then give it a go.

    Judge Dredd is directed by Danny Cannon and written by William Wisher Junior and Steven E. de Souza. It stars Sylvester Stallone, Armand Assante, Diane Lane, Rob Schneider, Joan Chen, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and Max von Sydow. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Adrian Biddle. Adapted from the Judge Dredd stories in British comic book 2000AD, the plot finds Stallone as Joseph Judge Dredd, a ruthless law enforcer of the future in Mega City 1. Framed for murder, Dredd finds himself on the other side of the fence, literally, as he is sent to prison beyond Mega City 1's walls out in the Cursed Earth. He must somehow escape to clear his name and stop Mega City 1 from becoming corrupted by those that framed him. OK, it's hardly brilliant, Schneider irritates, the real thesps in the film are wasted, it lifts from other notable sci-fi movies, so therefore it's lazy, and it has plot holes galore, but is Judge Dredd worthy of the critical mauling it got? Well no, actually. That is if you take it on its own mindless popcorn terms.... The action is fast paced, it's loud and brash, but not in an insulting way like Batman & Robin, Stallone positively plays it dead right with a glint in his eye and chin perfectly chiselled, Lane is sexy as heck-fire in figure hugging futuristic suit, while the production design, the colour toning and the effects (with one exception) are undervalued eye pleasing delights. Add in Assante having the time of his life as villain of the month psycho Rico Dredd, and it's a more than adequate blockbuster. I understand the fan's reactions, those of the comic book that is, because I'm one of them, I treasured my 2000AD and Starlord copies right into my 20s when I foolishly sold them on. This is without doubt a watered down version of Dredd, clearly caught between a fan director's will and a studio's insistence on popcorn munching appeasement. So it's a fact we don't have the ultra violence and general fascist wallop that permeates 2000AD's stiff backed hard bastard, but their are delicate hints of totalitarianism and Nazi overtones in Cannon's movie, whiffs of satire are there as well. It really isn't the directionless adaptation some insist it is. Many flaws for sure, but it makes for a nice companion piece to the better Demolition Man, for that is the bonkers popcorn world it sits in. A guilty pleasure? Well I don't feel guilty about enjoying Judge Dredd a lot, but yes Mr. Fascist, I'm guilty as charged. 6.5/10

    i Enjoy Dredd (2012) it was awesome as well even i Love This Movie but it wasn't balls to the wall Action scenes was good and fun but i agree what Stallone said it wasn't balls to wall agree and i did enjoy Judge Dredd movie with Stallone i liked the acting and his anger in movie like new one and i am not judge Dredd comic book reader sorry i am not but i enjoy and love the movies and i haven't read noting to books to it and i know Dredd doesn't take the helmet off that's what people say and never read the book of it i know people got Disappointment about this i didn't i liked it enjoy i am big Fan of Stallone big one and character Rico Dredd (Armand Assante) was pretty much of Psycho Path crazy guy well i know he is bad guy and Rob Schneider was worst in this movie i didn't find him funny in this film he played in 2 Stallone movies in Judge Dredd and Demotion Man but in this as apart from this movie not really that good when he was in Demotion Man he wasn't really part of movie only in 2 parts that's it in this in start and middle and end i really don't want Rob Schneider to be in this movie it was bit silly when he was in it that's why people saying why Rob in this movie ? people say Stallone Cartoon Version i don't find this Cartoon version i think that's how old movies was like that back then this is why Stallone had a bit Problems was this movie in Thirteen years after the release of Judge Dredd, Sylvester Stallone discussed his feelings about the movie in an issue of Uncut magazine in 2008 and he loved that property when I read it, because it took a genre that I love, what you could term the 'action morality film' and made it a bit more sophisticated. It had political overtones. It showed how if we don't curb the way we run our judicial system, the police may end up running our lives. It dealt with archaic governments; it dealt with cloning and all kinds of things that could happen in the future. It was also bigger than any film I've done in its physical stature and the way it was designed. All the people were dwarfed by the system and the architecture; it shows how insignificant human beings could be in the future. There's a lot of action in the movie and some great acting, too. It just wasn't balls to the wall. But I do look back on Judge Dredd as a real missed opportunity. It seemed that lots of fans had a problem with Dredd removing his helmet, because he never does in the comic books. But for me it is more about wasting such great potential there was in that idea, just think of all the opportunities there were to do interesting stuff with the Cursed Earth scenes. It didn't live up to what it could have been. It probably should have been much more comic, really humorous, and fun. What I learned out of that experience was that we shouldn't have tried to make it Hamlet; it's more Hamlet and Eggs that's what he said the film director for me was idiot Judge Dredd doesn't take out his Hamlet i agree maybe the director said F**ck his idea then the director did his own so he thinks Judge Dredd Fans people might think it's going to be great but you know what you didn't do it well i like movie like i said i love Action scenes him fighting with Rico was awesome and motorbike flying Motorbike and cops chasing Stallone was awesome start is Kinda Same as Dredd (2012) in Apartment shooting kinda same but 2 different movies but in Judge Dredd (1995) was kinda same at start in Apartment shoot out then in Dredd in awesome movie different not remake more of restart like batman Begins but different movies so Judge Dredd awesome and Dredd 2012 awesome both different movies if your a Stallone fan or Judge Dredd witch ones would you like better then first watch this one don't listen to fans they read comic books they comic book reader me i am not i am watch movies so yeah i enjoy this movie 10/10 for Sylvester Stallone

    It could have been Robocop" of the 90's . Instead we have a popcorn movie . The 90's weren't exactly the best time for comic book movies , but still this one has managed to be a decent one. Especially compared to Schumacher's Batman movies. I can't say I'm an expert when it comes to Dredd , but I read few comics about him and they were nice. Stallone is kinda wasted here as the main hero . He is able to play cold blooded , silent and gloomy character . He proved that in "Cobra". The authors too easily allow him to play just himself , not Dredd. Still , he's not bad in his role despite popular opinion . Even he's chin looks just like the chin of comic book Dredd. Max von Sydow , Jurgen Prochnow and Diane Lane all give nice performances and some depth to their characters . Watch out for Liev Schreiber in a small role of young academy judge . Also , Joan Chen makes an appearance . God knows why . There only reason is that they wanted to put a catfight into movie. Unfortunately , there are also two really bad performances that almost destroy the whole movie. Armand Assante who plays the villain, overacts through THE WHOLE MOVIE. He's shouting , smiling evil smiles and making big eyes so often he really is worse than a cartoon villain. Let's not forget about Rob Schneider  one of the most pathetic comediants alive. He's so annoying I wanted to kill him . He says a one funny thing through whole movie - "We don't have time for this" and gives a great parody of Stallone's voice . Except that he's AWFUL. I wonder if Stallone really needed a sidekick , since he does have a few funny one-liners himself. The upbeat music by Alan Silvestri is nice . So is the art-direction . The whole city looks EXACTLY like in the comics . The special effects are little dated in some places , but not bad. The movie pretends to asks some important questions about cloning or how to fight with evil , but only pretends . Too bad . In good hands it could be a good serious science fiction just like "Robocop". Stallone's other movie "The Demolition man " is much better. It doesn't mean this one isn't watchable. I give it 5/10.

    A lot of reviewers turned down this one due to the non-true adaption and the obvious irony plus the "Stallone-type" action style. Well, in fact this movie is extremely entertaining, has a good plot, excellent visuals and give the actors a lot of room and space for their character development. All this makes it better than the recent version of "Dredd". And even that difference between these two movies makes the original Stallone-Version even more better and much more entertaining. Also the violence in the 1995 adaption of the comic is present but does not need any gore to be effective. "Judge Dredd" and "Demolition Man" were true highlights of Stallones action sci-fi period, which unfortunately we not that successful as they probably should have been.

    For the people saying this was the worst movie ever made, get over yourself. The venom of comic book geeks astounds me sometimes, I know because I am one but I pride myself on being able to 'judge' a film on it's own merits. As an adaptation of the comic it is flawed with major points. The now infamous helmet issue seems to be the thing that everyone remembers about the film and Dredd's emotional injection is way off course. The film reeks of studio interference and writers ego when at that time, it was pretty common to stray from the source material for the sake of playing to a certain audience, which was not the fans of the comic. This is the bad! The good is the fact that there is lots of it here. The film looks amazing! The subject has been given the full big budget Hollywood treatment and boy does it show. The sets, scenery effects and make-up are all top quality and really give a great image of a dystopian future. Danny Cannon has a great eye for gorgeous wide shots that really show off an image and it's used to full effect in the film. Mega City one really looks the part and everything bar maybe a few plasticy looking costumes has a real sheen to it! Like it or not, Stallone is perfectly cast as Dredd. He has the physique, the voice and the jaw, it's just a shame that ego got in the way of such a perfect match. The actual film itself, if you are able to pull your head out of your comic book loving arse, is quite honestly a really decent 90's action sci-fi flick. There is lots of excitement and enough to keep anyone occupied for a couple of hours. It does feel however that more could have been explored in the film. Glaring flaws aside Hollywood in the 80's and 90's had a really nasty habit of making a film about a subject matter then writing a story that takes the main character totally out of the norm. This is rectified in the 2012 film where it's just Dredd doing his day to day job and that's what we want. Here Dredd is taken out of his job and thrust into a situation that we just don't want to see him in. At least they kept Rico instead of a generic made up villain and much of the genetic lore of Dredd. If you want a fun action film with a good look to kill an hour or two that Judge Dredd is well worth checking out but if you're looking for authenticity well.....you have the alternative now, so enjoy this for what it is, however an annoyingly missed opportunity it may be!

    Urban areas have grown into mega-cities that cover entire coastal regions. The justice system has evolved to a single person invested with the power of police, judge, jury, and executioner. Among the Judges of Mega-City One is Dredd, who is one of the best, and a particular favourite of the Head of the Council, Judge Fargo. But there are evil forces at work, block riots and the escape of Rico, a homicidal maniac, are only steps in a plan that ultimately lead to the sentencing of Dredd for a murder he didn't commit. And Dredd must discover the secrets of his own past and survive to stop the evildoers.... Beyond some terrible dialogue, and comic book atrocities, Judge Dredd is simply a summer blockbuster starring an actor whose best years were back in the mid-eighties, which didn't help the film at all. 1995 was a poor year for summer blockbuster.

    When i was a child i loved this film, having read a lot of Dredd comic books i am a huge fan. I recently watched this film again and cringed at how bad the plot/acting etc was. Rob Schnieder ruins this movie for me. But at the same time it has some fun action and brings me back some happy memories. If you are looking for a good movie with good acting this might not be for you, after all the star is sly Stallone, Although, if you are looking for a fun action film with explosions then give it a go.

    Judge Dredd is directed by Danny Cannon and written by William Wisher Junior and Steven E. de Souza. It stars Sylvester Stallone, Armand Assante, Diane Lane, Rob Schneider, Joan Chen, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and Max von Sydow. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Adrian Biddle. Adapted from the Judge Dredd stories in British comic book 2000AD, the plot finds Stallone as Joseph Judge Dredd, a ruthless law enforcer of the future in Mega City 1. Framed for murder, Dredd finds himself on the other side of the fence, literally, as he is sent to prison beyond Mega City 1's walls out in the Cursed Earth. He must somehow escape to clear his name and stop Mega City 1 from becoming corrupted by those that framed him. OK, it's hardly brilliant, Schneider irritates, the real thesps in the film are wasted, it lifts from other notable sci-fi movies, so therefore it's lazy, and it has plot holes galore, but is Judge Dredd worthy of the critical mauling it got? Well no, actually. That is if you take it on its own mindless popcorn terms.... The action is fast paced, it's loud and brash, but not in an insulting way like Batman & Robin, Stallone positively plays it dead right with a glint in his eye and chin perfectly chiselled, Lane is sexy as heck-fire in figure hugging futuristic suit, while the production design, the colour toning and the effects (with one exception) are undervalued eye pleasing delights. Add in Assante having the time of his life as villain of the month psycho Rico Dredd, and it's a more than adequate blockbuster. I understand the fan's reactions, those of the comic book that is, because I'm one of them, I treasured my 2000AD and Starlord copies right into my 20s when I foolishly sold them on. This is without doubt a watered down version of Dredd, clearly caught between a fan director's will and a studio's insistence on popcorn munching appeasement. So it's a fact we don't have the ultra violence and general fascist wallop that permeates 2000AD's stiff backed hard bastard, but their are delicate hints of totalitarianism and Nazi overtones in Cannon's movie, whiffs of satire are there as well. It really isn't the directionless adaptation some insist it is. Many flaws for sure, but it makes for a nice companion piece to the better Demolition Man, for that is the bonkers popcorn world it sits in. A guilty pleasure? Well I don't feel guilty about enjoying Judge Dredd a lot, but yes Mr. Fascist, I'm guilty as charged. 6.5/10

    i Enjoy Dredd (2012) it was awesome as well even i Love This Movie but it wasn't balls to the wall Action scenes was good and fun but i agree what Stallone said it wasn't balls to wall agree and i did enjoy Judge Dredd movie with Stallone i liked the acting and his anger in movie like new one and i am not judge Dredd comic book reader sorry i am not but i enjoy and love the movies and i haven't read noting to books to it and i know Dredd doesn't take the helmet off that's what people say and never read the book of it i know people got Disappointment about this i didn't i liked it enjoy i am big Fan of Stallone big one and character Rico Dredd (Armand Assante) was pretty much of Psycho Path crazy guy well i know he is bad guy and Rob Schneider was worst in this movie i didn't find him funny in this film he played in 2 Stallone movies in Judge Dredd and Demotion Man but in this as apart from this movie not really that good when he was in Demotion Man he wasn't really part of movie only in 2 parts that's it in this in start and middle and end i really don't want Rob Schneider to be in this movie it was bit silly when he was in it that's why people saying why Rob in this movie ? people say Stallone Cartoon Version i don't find this Cartoon version i think that's how old movies was like that back then this is why Stallone had a bit Problems was this movie in Thirteen years after the release of Judge Dredd, Sylvester Stallone discussed his feelings about the movie in an issue of Uncut magazine in 2008 and he loved that property when I read it, because it took a genre that I love, what you could term the 'action morality film' and made it a bit more sophisticated. It had political overtones. It showed how if we don't curb the way we run our judicial system, the police may end up running our lives. It dealt with archaic governments; it dealt with cloning and all kinds of things that could happen in the future. It was also bigger than any film I've done in its physical stature and the way it was designed. All the people were dwarfed by the system and the architecture; it shows how insignificant human beings could be in the future. There's a lot of action in the movie and some great acting, too. It just wasn't balls to the wall. But I do look back on Judge Dredd as a real missed opportunity. It seemed that lots of fans had a problem with Dredd removing his helmet, because he never does in the comic books. But for me it is more about wasting such great potential there was in that idea, just think of all the opportunities there were to do interesting stuff with the Cursed Earth scenes. It didn't live up to what it could have been. It probably should have been much more comic, really humorous, and fun. What I learned out of that experience was that we shouldn't have tried to make it Hamlet; it's more Hamlet and Eggs that's what he said the film director for me was idiot Judge Dredd doesn't take out his Hamlet i agree maybe the director said F**ck his idea then the director did his own so he thinks Judge Dredd Fans people might think it's going to be great but you know what you didn't do it well i like movie like i said i love Action scenes him fighting with Rico was awesome and motorbike flying Motorbike and cops chasing Stallone was awesome start is Kinda Same as Dredd (2012) in Apartment shooting kinda same but 2 different movies but in Judge Dredd (1995) was kinda same at start in Apartment shoot out then in Dredd in awesome movie different not remake more of restart like batman Begins but different movies so Judge Dredd awesome and Dredd 2012 awesome both different movies if your a Stallone fan or Judge Dredd witch ones would you like better then first watch this one don't listen to fans they read comic books they comic book reader me i am not i am watch movies so yeah i enjoy this movie 10/10 for Sylvester Stallone

    It could have been Robocop" of the 90's . Instead we have a popcorn movie . The 90's weren't exactly the best time for comic book movies , but still this one has managed to be a decent one. Especially compared to Schumacher's Batman movies. I can't say I'm an expert when it comes to Dredd , but I read few comics about him and they were nice. Stallone is kinda wasted here as the main hero . He is able to play cold blooded , silent and gloomy character . He proved that in "Cobra". The authors too easily allow him to play just himself , not Dredd. Still , he's not bad in his role despite popular opinion . Even he's chin looks just like the chin of comic book Dredd. Max von Sydow , Jurgen Prochnow and Diane Lane all give nice performances and some depth to their characters . Watch out for Liev Schreiber in a small role of young academy judge . Also , Joan Chen makes an appearance . God knows why . There only reason is that they wanted to put a catfight into movie. Unfortunately , there are also two really bad performances that almost destroy the whole movie. Armand Assante who plays the villain, overacts through THE WHOLE MOVIE. He's shouting , smiling evil smiles and making big eyes so often he really is worse than a cartoon villain. Let's not forget about Rob Schneider  one of the most pathetic comediants alive. He's so annoying I wanted to kill him . He says a one funny thing through whole movie - "We don't have time for this" and gives a great parody of Stallone's voice . Except that he's AWFUL. I wonder if Stallone really needed a sidekick , since he does have a few funny one-liners himself. The upbeat music by Alan Silvestri is nice . So is the art-direction . The whole city looks EXACTLY like in the comics . The special effects are little dated in some places , but not bad. The movie pretends to asks some important questions about cloning or how to fight with evil , but only pretends . Too bad . In good hands it could be a good serious science fiction just like "Robocop". Stallone's other movie "The Demolition man " is much better. It doesn't mean this one isn't watchable. I give it 5/10.

    A lot of reviewers turned down this one due to the non-true adaption and the obvious irony plus the "Stallone-type" action style. Well, in fact this movie is extremely entertaining, has a good plot, excellent visuals and give the actors a lot of room and space for their character development. All this makes it better than the recent version of "Dredd". And even that difference between these two movies makes the original Stallone-Version even more better and much more entertaining. Also the violence in the 1995 adaption of the comic is present but does not need any gore to be effective. "Judge Dredd" and "Demolition Man" were true highlights of Stallones action sci-fi period, which unfortunately we not that successful as they probably should have been.

    For the people saying this was the worst movie ever made, get over yourself. The venom of comic book geeks astounds me sometimes, I know because I am one but I pride myself on being able to 'judge' a film on it's own merits. As an adaptation of the comic it is flawed with major points. The now infamous helmet issue seems to be the thing that everyone remembers about the film and Dredd's emotional injection is way off course. The film reeks of studio interference and writers ego when at that time, it was pretty common to stray from the source material for the sake of playing to a certain audience, which was not the fans of the comic. This is the bad! The good is the fact that there is lots of it here. The film looks amazing! The subject has been given the full big budget Hollywood treatment and boy does it show. The sets, scenery effects and make-up are all top quality and really give a great image of a dystopian future. Danny Cannon has a great eye for gorgeous wide shots that really show off an image and it's used to full effect in the film. Mega City one really looks the part and everything bar maybe a few plasticy looking costumes has a real sheen to it! Like it or not, Stallone is perfectly cast as Dredd. He has the physique, the voice and the jaw, it's just a shame that ego got in the way of such a perfect match. The actual film itself, if you are able to pull your head out of your comic book loving arse, is quite honestly a really decent 90's action sci-fi flick. There is lots of excitement and enough to keep anyone occupied for a couple of hours. It does feel however that more could have been explored in the film. Glaring flaws aside Hollywood in the 80's and 90's had a really nasty habit of making a film about a subject matter then writing a story that takes the main character totally out of the norm. This is rectified in the 2012 film where it's just Dredd doing his day to day job and that's what we want. Here Dredd is taken out of his job and thrust into a situation that we just don't want to see him in. At least they kept Rico instead of a generic made up villain and much of the genetic lore of Dredd. If you want a fun action film with a good look to kill an hour or two that Judge Dredd is well worth checking out but if you're looking for authenticity well.....you have the alternative now, so enjoy this for what it is, however an annoyingly missed opportunity it may be!

    As a fan of the comic, this was *dredd*ful. (good one) I own every single one of the comics and was disappointed and unimpressed when I watched this. Problem 1) they got Dredd's helmet wrong. If you are a fan of the comic, Dredd's helmet has a cross across the front. Im so annoyed that they missed this small but distinguishable feature. Problem 2) Dredd is a clone of another judge, and is famous for being a rigid follower of rules. He spares no-one and will carry out punishment as necessary. In this film, he shows too much emotion, which I believed took his authority as 'Dredd' away. Problem 3) They take his helmet off. Why??? You are *not* supposed to see his face! That's the whole point! Maybe i'm over exaggerating, but seriously, that's not good. If you want to understand the point of Judge Dredd without reading all 2000-something comics, see Dredd3d. Thank you. Rant over.

    After watching "Dredd"(2012), I expected less from this movie. But it has all the things I felt the new movie missed. The plot is like one that would be seen in the comic itself. "Dredd" doesn't really utilize much from the comic, besides the setting and characters. But this movie goes above and beyond! Even one of Dredd's classic adversaries is put in the movie! Stallone hits the personality of Judge Dredd dead on, having the serious love of the law while having his occasional comedic moments. "Dredd" is dark, serious, and more gory than Robocop! But this movie, all though not having the best computer animation (it was released in 1995), is a total blast! one of my personal favorites.

    Urban areas have grown into mega-cities that cover entire coastal regions. The justice system has evolved to a single person invested with the power of police, judge, jury, and executioner. Among the Judges of Mega-City One is Dredd, who is one of the best, and a particular favourite of the Head of the Council, Judge Fargo. But there are evil forces at work, block riots and the escape of Rico, a homicidal maniac, are only steps in a plan that ultimately lead to the sentencing of Dredd for a murder he didn't commit. And Dredd must discover the secrets of his own past and survive to stop the evildoers.... Beyond some terrible dialogue, and comic book atrocities, Judge Dredd is simply a summer blockbuster starring an actor whose best years were back in the mid-eighties, which didn't help the film at all. 1995 was a poor year for summer blockbuster. We had Waterworld, Batman Forever, Casper, and of course, Congo. So in all fairness, this is the reason why this film endears me more than others. Stallone is how you would expect, pretty bland, but still a big screen presence whatever the film he's in. And if you were brought up on eighties action, you'll lap it up. The rest of the cast are okay, Lane is a standout, but whatever Assante is on, I really need some. I have never seen a villain so over the top in a movie. Yes, he's supposed to be a psycho and everything, but having literally scream every line and sneer every five minutes is just bonkers. Effects are okay, and Schneider provides unnecessary humour, but all in all it's a big, dumb, fun, summer movie. So what if he takes his helmet off. He was judged.

    Exciting , big-budgeted film dealing with a standard comic book dystopian near-future City where rules fearful judges and happens fantastic events . The source comic book has been a cult favorite in England for thirty years . Loud , spectacular and violent movie set in a future world of urban chaos and based on the comic books by Carlos Ezquerra and John Wagner ; being well adapted by Danny Cannon . In the third Milennium , the futuristic world changed , climate , nations , all were upheaval . The Earth transformed into a poisonous scorched desert , known as &uml;The Cursed Earth&uml;. Millions of people crowed into a few mega Cities where roving bands of street savages created violence the justice system could not control . The Planet Earth has changed into a virtually uninhabitable place . All of the Earth's population have crowded into the cities across the planet , now known as "Mega Cities&uml; . Law as we know it collapsed . From the decay rose a new order whose rule of law is administrated by authorities on motorbikes . A society ruled by a new elite force . A Force with the power to dispense both justice and punishment . They were the police , jury and executioner all in one . They were the judges . Around desert lies Mega City One . It is a violent, futuristic city where a new Justice System came from the ashes , the police has the authority to act as judge, jury and executioner, they were called "Judges" and dispense justice on the riot-torn streets and buildings of Mega City . They fight to control the block riots that over-running the city . The crimes in this "Mega city" became so violent and so powerful, that the regular justice system was powerless to contain, then it collapsed completely . A cop named Dredd , most feared of all , teams with a another judge named Hershey (Diane Lane) to take down criminal gangs , but Dredd is double-crossed and being framed for murder . Dredd fights to clear his name helped by the women-judge and a likable delinquent (Rob Schneider), a renegade misfit named Ferguson , must confront the odds and engage in the relentless battle for their survival . But an escaped convict named Rico (Armand Assante) overtakes the compound's control center and wages a dirty, vicious war against the Judges that proves she will stop at nothing to protect her empire . Rico is an ex-judge who was artificially created and seeks vendetta and power confronting his half-brother , Dredd . Judge Dredd soon released from his imprisonment looks for his genetically contrived evil brother and takes place the final battle . This slam-bang film packs big names , noisy action , thrills , chills , suspense , convoluted screenplay , high body count , loads of massive villains and lots of violence . Some interesting plotting is partially lost in a sea of hard-edge violence , overripe acting , exaggerated explosions and excessive shots . Visually imaginative action Sci-Fi that contains fast and furious fun with echoes of &uml;Metropolis&uml;, &uml;Things to come&uml; and &uml;Blade Runner&uml; . The exciting screenplay throws in Femme cop and a likable inmate , Rob Schneider , who acts as comic relief. The highlights of the movie are a smashing Airbone pursuit on flying motor-bikes and the breathtaking , overwhelming finale . Silvester Stallone's iconic presence is good as a helmeted , emotionless future-cop who dispenses the square jaw-lines and a summary justice. Fizzing visuals , video game-like special effects and impressive production design showing a large megalopolis in &uml;Blade Runner&uml; style . Praiseworthy set design by Nigel Phelps who creates a doleful as well as amazing ghetto City . Atmospheric original music by Alan Silvestri , composed by means of synthesizer . Colorful , though sometimes dark cinematography by Adrian Biddle . The precocious technical mastery displayed by Danny Cannon is spectacular and he delivers narrative fluidity . However , the film failed at box office ; Silvester Stallone , Sly, hoped , in vain , the project would provide him another profitable franchise but it didn't take place . Many years later was shot Dredd 3D (2012) by Pete Travis with Karl Urban , Olivia Thirby and Lena Headley . Rating : 6,5 . Acceptable action film and it will appeal to Stallone enthusiasts and action fans .

Stallone is kinda wasted here as the main hero . He is able to play cold blooded , silent and gloomy character . He proved that in "Cobra". The authors too easily allow him to play just himself , not Dredd. Still , he's not bad in his role despite popular opinion . Even he's chin looks just like the chin of comic book Dredd. Max von Sydow , Jurgen Prochnow and Diane Lane all give nice performances and some depth to their characters . Watch out for Liev Schreiber in a small role of young academy judge . Also , Joan Chen makes an appearance . God knows why . There only reason is that they wanted to put a catfight into movie. Unfortunately , there are also two really bad performances that almost destroy the whole movie. Armand Assante who plays the villain, overacts through THE WHOLE MOVIE. He's shouting , smiling evil smiles and making big eyes so often he really is worse than a cartoon villain. Let's not forget about Rob Schneider  one of the most pathetic comediants alive. He's so annoying I wanted to kill him . He says a one funny thing through whole movie - "We don't have time for this" and gives a great parody of Stallone's voice . Except that he's AWFUL. I wonder if Stallone really needed a sidekick , since he does have a few funny one-liners himself. The upbeat music by Alan Silvestri is nice . So is the art-direction . The whole city looks EXACTLY like in the comics . The special effects are little dated in some places , but not bad. The movie pretends to asks some important questions about cloning or how to fight with evil , but only pretends . Too bad . In good hands it could be a good serious science fiction just like "Robocop". Stallone's other movie "The Demolition man " is much better. It doesn't mean this one isn't watchable. I give it 5/10.

    A lot of reviewers turned down this one due to the non-true adaption and the obvious irony plus the "Stallone-type" action style. Well, in fact this movie is extremely entertaining, has a good plot, excellent visuals and give the actors a lot of room and space for their character development. All this makes it better than the recent version of "Dredd". And even that difference between these two movies makes the original Stallone-Version even more better and much more entertaining. Also the violence in the 1995 adaption of the comic is present but does not need any gore to be effective. "Judge Dredd" and "Demolition Man" were true highlights of Stallones action sci-fi period, which unfortunately we not that successful as they probably should have been.

    For the people saying this was the worst movie ever made, get over yourself. The venom of comic book geeks astounds me sometimes, I know because I am one but I pride myself on being able to 'judge' a film on it's own merits. As an adaptation of the comic it is flawed with major points. The now infamous helmet issue seems to be the thing that everyone remembers about the film and Dredd's emotional injection is way off course. The film reeks of studio interference and writers ego when at that time, it was pretty common to stray from the source material for the sake of playing to a certain audience, which was not the fans of the comic. This is the bad! The good is the fact that there is lots of it here. The film looks amazing! The subject has been given the full big budget Hollywood treatment and boy does it show. The sets, scenery effects and make-up are all top quality and really give a great image of a dystopian future. Danny Cannon has a great eye for gorgeous wide shots that really show off an image and it's used to full effect in the film. Mega City one really looks the part and everything bar maybe a few plasticy looking costumes has a real sheen to it! Like it or not, Stallone is perfectly cast as Dredd. He has the physique, the voice and the jaw, it's just a shame that ego got in the way of such a perfect match. The actual film itself, if you are able to pull your head out of your comic book loving arse, is quite honestly a really decent 90's action sci-fi flick. There is lots of excitement and enough to keep anyone occupied for a couple of hours. It does feel however that more could have been explored in the film. Glaring flaws aside Hollywood in the 80's and 90's had a really nasty habit of making a film about a subject matter then writing a story that takes the main character totally out of the norm. This is rectified in the 2012 film where it's just Dredd doing his day to day job and that's what we want. Here Dredd is taken out of his job and thrust into a situation that we just don't want to see him in. At least they kept Rico instead of a generic made up villain and much of the genetic lore of Dredd. If you want a fun action film with a good look to kill an hour or two that Judge Dredd is well worth checking out but if you're looking for authenticity well.....you have the alternative now, so enjoy this for what it is, however an annoyingly missed opportunity it may be!

    As a fan of the comic, this was *dredd*ful. (good one) I own every single one of the comics and was disappointed and unimpressed when I watched this. Problem 1) they got Dredd's helmet wrong. If you are a fan of the comic, Dredd's helmet has a cross across the front. Im so annoyed that they missed this small but distinguishable feature. Problem 2) Dredd is a clone of another judge, and is famous for being a rigid follower of rules. He spares no-one and will carry out punishment as necessary. In this film, he shows too much emotion, which I believed took his authority as 'Dredd' away. Problem 3) They take his helmet off. Why??? You are *not* supposed to see his face! That's the whole point! Maybe i'm over exaggerating, but seriously, that's not good. If you want to understand the point of Judge Dredd without reading all 2000-something comics, see Dredd3d. Thank you. Rant over.

    After watching "Dredd"(2012), I expected less from this movie. But it has all the things I felt the new movie missed. The plot is like one that would be seen in the comic itself. "Dredd" doesn't really utilize much from the comic, besides the setting and characters. But this movie goes above and beyond! Even one of Dredd's classic adversaries is put in the movie! Stallone hits the personality of Judge Dredd dead on, having the serious love of the law while having his occasional comedic moments. "Dredd" is dark, serious, and more gory than Robocop! But this movie, all though not having the best computer animation (it was released in 1995), is a total blast! one of my personal favorites.

    Urban areas have grown into mega-cities that cover entire coastal regions. The justice system has evolved to a single person invested with the power of police, judge, jury, and executioner. Among the Judges of Mega-City One is Dredd, who is one of the best, and a particular favourite of the Head of the Council, Judge Fargo. But there are evil forces at work, block riots and the escape of Rico, a homicidal maniac, are only steps in a plan that ultimately lead to the sentencing of Dredd for a murder he didn't commit. And Dredd must discover the secrets of his own past and survive to stop the evildoers.... Beyond some terrible dialogue, and comic book atrocities, Judge Dredd is simply a summer blockbuster starring an actor whose best years were back in the mid-eighties, which didn't help the film at all. 1995 was a poor year for summer blockbuster. We had Waterworld, Batman Forever, Casper, and of course, Congo. So in all fairness, this is the reason why this film endears me more than others. Stallone is how you would expect, pretty bland, but still a big screen presence whatever the film he's in. And if you were brought up on eighties action, you'll lap it up. The rest of the cast are okay, Lane is a standout, but whatever Assante is on, I really need some. I have never seen a villain so over the top in a movie. Yes, he's supposed to be a psycho and everything, but having literally scream every line and sneer every five minutes is just bonkers. Effects are okay, and Schneider provides unnecessary humour, but all in all it's a big, dumb, fun, summer movie. So what if he takes his helmet off. He was judged.

    Exciting , big-budgeted film dealing with a standard comic book dystopian near-future City where rules fearful judges and happens fantastic events . The source comic book has been a cult favorite in England for thirty years . Loud , spectacular and violent movie set in a future world of urban chaos and based on the comic books by Carlos Ezquerra and John Wagner ; being well adapted by Danny Cannon . In the third Milennium , the futuristic world changed , climate , nations , all were upheaval . The Earth transformed into a poisonous scorched desert , known as &uml;The Cursed Earth&uml;. Millions of people crowed into a few mega Cities where roving bands of street savages created violence the justice system could not control . The Planet Earth has changed into a virtually uninhabitable place . All of the Earth's population have crowded into the cities across the planet , now known as "Mega Cities&uml; . Law as we know it collapsed . From the decay rose a new order whose rule of law is administrated by authorities on motorbikes . A society ruled by a new elite force . A Force with the power to dispense both justice and punishment . They were the police , jury and executioner all in one . They were the judges . Around desert lies Mega City One . It is a violent, futuristic city where a new Justice System came from the ashes , the police has the authority to act as judge, jury and executioner, they were called "Judges" and dispense justice on the riot-torn streets and buildings of Mega City . They fight to control the block riots that over-running the city . The crimes in this "Mega city" became so violent and so powerful, that the regular justice system was powerless to contain, then it collapsed completely . A cop named Dredd , most feared of all , teams with a another judge named Hershey (Diane Lane) to take down criminal gangs , but Dredd is double-crossed and being framed for murder . Dredd fights to clear his name helped by the women-judge and a likable delinquent (Rob Schneider), a renegade misfit named Ferguson , must confront the odds and engage in the relentless battle for their survival . But an escaped convict named Rico (Armand Assante) overtakes the compound's control center and wages a dirty, vicious war against the Judges that proves she will stop at nothing to protect her empire . Rico is an ex-judge who was artificially created and seeks vendetta and power confronting his half-brother , Dredd . Judge Dredd soon released from his imprisonment looks for his genetically contrived evil brother and takes place the final battle . This slam-bang film packs big names , noisy action , thrills , chills , suspense , convoluted screenplay , high body count , loads of massive villains and lots of violence . Some interesting plotting is partially lost in a sea of hard-edge violence , overripe acting , exaggerated explosions and excessive shots . Visually imaginative action Sci-Fi that contains fast and furious fun with echoes of &uml;Metropolis&uml;, &uml;Things to come&uml; and &uml;Blade Runner&uml; . The exciting screenplay throws in Femme cop and a likable inmate , Rob Schneider , who acts as comic relief. The highlights of the movie are a smashing Airbone pursuit on flying motor-bikes and the breathtaking , overwhelming finale . Silvester Stallone's iconic presence is good as a helmeted , emotionless future-cop who dispenses the square jaw-lines and a summary justice. Fizzing visuals , video game-like special effects and impressive production design showing a large megalopolis in &uml;Blade Runner&uml; style . Praiseworthy set design by Nigel Phelps who creates a doleful as well as amazing ghetto City . Atmospheric original music by Alan Silvestri , composed by means of synthesizer . Colorful , though sometimes dark cinematography by Adrian Biddle . The precocious technical mastery displayed by Danny Cannon is spectacular and he delivers narrative fluidity . However , the film failed at box office ; Silvester Stallone , Sly, hoped , in vain , the project would provide him another profitable franchise but it didn't take place . Many years later was shot Dredd 3D (2012) by Pete Travis with Karl Urban , Olivia Thirby and Lena Headley . Rating : 6,5 . Acceptable action film and it will appeal to Stallone enthusiasts and action fans .

    When i was a child i loved this film, having read a lot of Dredd comic books i am a huge fan. I recently watched this film again and cringed at how bad the plot/acting etc was. Rob Schnieder ruins this movie for me. But at the same time it has some fun action and brings me back some happy memories. If you are looking for a good movie with good acting this might not be for you, after all the star is sly Stallone, Although, if you are looking for a fun action film with explosions then give it a go.

    Judge Dredd is directed by Danny Cannon and written by William Wisher Junior and Steven E. de Souza. It stars Sylvester Stallone, Armand Assante, Diane Lane, Rob Schneider, Joan Chen, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and Max von Sydow. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Adrian Biddle. Adapted from the Judge Dredd stories in British comic book 2000AD, the plot finds Stallone as Joseph Judge Dredd, a ruthless law enforcer of the future in Mega City 1. Framed for murder, Dredd finds himself on the other side of the fence, literally, as he is sent to prison beyond Mega City 1's walls out in the Cursed Earth. He must somehow escape to clear his name and stop Mega City 1 from becoming corrupted by those that framed him. OK, it's hardly brilliant, Schneider irritates, the real thesps in the film are wasted, it lifts from other notable sci-fi movies, so therefore it's lazy, and it has plot holes galore, but is Judge Dredd worthy of the critical mauling it got? Well no, actually. That is if you take it on its own mindless popcorn terms.... The action is fast paced, it's loud and brash, but not in an insulting way like Batman & Robin, Stallone positively plays it dead right with a glint in his eye and chin perfectly chiselled, Lane is sexy as heck-fire in figure hugging futuristic suit, while the production design, the colour toning and the effects (with one exception) are undervalued eye pleasing delights. Add in Assante having the time of his life as villain of the month psycho Rico Dredd, and it's a more than adequate blockbuster. I understand the fan's reactions, those of the comic book that is, because I'm one of them, I treasured my 2000AD and Starlord copies right into my 20s when I foolishly sold them on. This is without doubt a watered down version of Dredd, clearly caught between a fan director's will and a studio's insistence on popcorn munching appeasement. So it's a fact we don't have the ultra violence and general fascist wallop that permeates 2000AD's stiff backed hard bastard, but their are delicate hints of totalitarianism and Nazi overtones in Cannon's movie, whiffs of satire are there as well. It really isn't the directionless adaptation some insist it is. Many flaws for sure, but it makes for a nice companion piece to the better Demolition Man, for that is the bonkers popcorn world it sits in. A guilty pleasure? Well I don't feel guilty about enjoying Judge Dredd a lot, but yes Mr. Fascist, I'm guilty as charged. 6.5/10

    i Enjoy Dredd (2012) it was awesome as well even i Love This Movie but it wasn't balls to the wall Action scenes was good and fun but i agree what Stallone said it wasn't balls to wall agree and i did enjoy Judge Dredd movie with Stallone i liked the acting and his anger in movie like new one and i am not judge Dredd comic book reader sorry i am not but i enjoy and love the movies and i haven't read noting to books to it and i know Dredd doesn't take the helmet off that's what people say and never read the book of it i know people got Disappointment about this i didn't i liked it enjoy i am big Fan of Stallone big one and character Rico Dredd (Armand Assante) was pretty much of Psycho Path crazy guy well i know he is bad guy and Rob Schneider was worst in this movie i didn't find him funny in this film he played in 2 Stallone movies in Judge Dredd and Demotion Man but in this as apart from this movie not really that good when he was in Demotion Man he wasn't really part of movie only in 2 parts that's it in this in start and middle and end i really don't want Rob Schneider to be in this movie it was bit silly when he was in it that's why people saying why Rob in this movie ? people say Stallone Cartoon Version i don't find this Cartoon version i think that's how old movies was like that back then this is why Stallone had a bit Problems was this movie in Thirteen years after the release of Judge Dredd, Sylvester Stallone discussed his feelings about the movie in an issue of Uncut magazine in 2008 and he loved that property when I read it, because it took a genre that I love, what you could term the 'action morality film' and made it a bit more sophisticated. It had political overtones. It showed how if we don't curb the way we run our judicial system, the police may end up running our lives. It dealt with archaic governments; it dealt with cloning and all kinds of things that could happen in the future. It was also bigger than any film I've done in its physical stature and the way it was designed. All the people were dwarfed by the system and the architecture; it shows how insignificant human beings could be in the future. There's a lot of action in the movie and some great acting, too. It just wasn't balls to the wall. But I do look back on Judge Dredd as a real missed opportunity. It seemed that lots of fans had a problem with Dredd removing his helmet, because he never does in the comic books. But for me it is more about wasting such great potential there was in that idea, just think of all the opportunities there were to do interesting stuff with the Cursed Earth scenes. It didn't live up to what it could have been. It probably should have been much more comic, really humorous, and fun. What I learned out of that experience was that we shouldn't have tried to make it Hamlet; it's more Hamlet and Eggs that's what he said the film director for me was idiot Judge Dredd doesn't take out his Hamlet i agree maybe the director said F**ck his idea then the director did his own so he thinks Judge Dredd Fans people might think it's going to be great but you know what you didn't do it well i like movie like i said i love Action scenes him fighting with Rico was awesome and motorbike flying Motorbike and cops chasing Stallone was awesome start is Kinda Same as Dredd (2012) in Apartment shooting kinda same but 2 different movies but in Judge Dredd (1995) was kinda same at start in Apartment shoot out then in Dredd in awesome movie different not remake more of restart like batman Begins but different movies so Judge Dredd awesome and Dredd 2012 awesome both different movies if your a Stallone fan or Judge Dredd witch ones would you like better then first watch this one don't listen to fans they read comic books they comic book reader me i am not i am watch movies so yeah i enjoy this movie 10/10 for Sylvester Stallone

    Urban areas have grown into mega-cities that cover entire coastal regions. The justice system has evolved to a single person invested with the power of police, judge, jury, and executioner. Among the Judges of Mega-City One is Dredd, who is one of the best, and a particular favourite of the Head of the Council, Judge Fargo. But there are evil forces at work, block riots and the escape of Rico, a homicidal maniac, are only steps in a plan that ultimately lead to the sentencing of Dredd for a murder he didn't commit. And Dredd must discover the secrets of his own past and survive to stop the evildoers.... Beyond some terrible dialogue, and comic book atrocities, Judge Dredd is simply a summer blockbuster starring an actor whose best years were back in the mid-eighties, which didn't help the film at all. 1995 was a poor year for summer blockbuster. We had Waterworld, Batman Forever, Casper, and of course, Congo. So in all fairness, this is the reason why this film endears me more than others. Stallone is how you would expect, pretty bland, but still a big screen presence whatever the film he's in. And if you were brought up on eighties action, you'll lap it up. The rest of the cast are okay, Lane is a standout, but whatever Assante is on, I really need some. I have never seen a villain so over the top in a movie. Yes, he's supposed to be a psycho and everything, but having literally scream every line and sneer every five minutes is just bonkers. Effects are okay, and Schneider provides unnecessary humour, but all in all it's a big, dumb, fun, summer movie. So what if he takes his helmet off. He was judged.

    Exciting , big-budgeted film dealing with a standard comic book dystopian near-future City where rules fearful judges and happens fantastic events . The source comic book has been a cult favorite in England for thirty years . Loud , spectacular and violent movie set in a future world of urban chaos and based on the comic books by Carlos Ezquerra and John Wagner ; being well adapted by Danny Cannon . In the third Milennium , the futuristic world changed , climate , nations , all were upheaval . The Earth transformed into a poisonous scorched desert , known as &uml;The Cursed Earth&uml;. Millions of people crowed into a few mega Cities where roving bands of street savages created violence the justice system could not control . The Planet Earth has changed into a virtually uninhabitable place . All of the Earth's population have crowded into the cities across the planet , now known as "Mega Cities&uml; . Law as we know it collapsed . From the decay rose a new order whose rule of law is administrated by authorities on motorbikes . A society ruled by a new elite force . A Force with the power to dispense both justice and punishment . They were the police , jury and executioner all in one . They were the judges . Around desert lies Mega City One . It is a violent, futuristic city where a new Justice System came from the ashes , the police has the authority to act as judge, jury and executioner, they were called "Judges" and dispense justice on the riot-torn streets and buildings of Mega City . They fight to control the block riots that over-running the city . The crimes in this "Mega city" became so violent and so powerful, that the regular justice system was powerless to contain, then it collapsed completely . A cop named Dredd , most feared of all , teams with a another judge named Hershey (Diane Lane) to take down criminal gangs , but Dredd is double-crossed and being framed for murder . Dredd fights to clear his name helped by the women-judge and a likable delinquent (Rob Schneider), a renegade misfit named Ferguson , must confront the odds and engage in the relentless battle for their survival . But an escaped convict named Rico (Armand Assante) overtakes the compound's control center and wages a dirty, vicious war against the Judges that proves she will stop at nothing to protect her empire . Rico is an ex-judge who was artificially created and seeks vendetta and power confronting his half-brother , Dredd . Judge Dredd soon released from his imprisonment looks for his genetically contrived evil brother and takes place the final battle . This slam-bang film packs big names , noisy action , thrills , chills , suspense , convoluted screenplay , high body count , loads of massive villains and lots of violence . Some interesting plotting is partially lost in a sea of hard-edge violence , overripe acting , exaggerated explosions and excessive shots . Visually imaginative action Sci-Fi that contains fast and furious fun with echoes of &uml;Metropolis&uml;, &uml;Things to come&uml; and &uml;Blade Runner&uml; . The exciting screenplay throws in Femme cop and a likable inmate , Rob Schneider , who acts as comic relief. The highlights of the movie are a smashing Airbone pursuit on flying motor-bikes and the breathtaking , overwhelming finale . Silvester Stallone's iconic presence is good as a helmeted , emotionless future-cop who dispenses the square jaw-lines and a summary justice. Fizzing visuals , video game-like special effects and impressive production design showing a large megalopolis in &uml;Blade Runner&uml; style . Praiseworthy set design by Nigel Phelps who creates a doleful as well as amazing ghetto City . Atmospheric original music by Alan Silvestri , composed by means of synthesizer . Colorful , though sometimes dark cinematography by Adrian Biddle . The precocious technical mastery displayed by Danny Cannon is spectacular and he delivers narrative fluidity . However , the film failed at box office ; Silvester Stallone , Sly, hoped , in vain , the project would provide him another profitable franchise but it didn't take place . Many years later was shot Dredd 3D (2012) by Pete Travis with Karl Urban , Olivia Thirby and Lena Headley . Rating : 6,5 . Acceptable action film and it will appeal to Stallone enthusiasts and action fans .

    When i was a child i loved this film, having read a lot of Dredd comic books i am a huge fan. I recently watched this film again and cringed at how bad the plot/acting etc was. Rob Schnieder ruins this movie for me. But at the same time it has some fun action and brings me back some happy memories. If you are looking for a good movie with good acting this might not be for you, after all the star is sly Stallone, Although, if you are looking for a fun action film with explosions then give it a go.

    Judge Dredd is directed by Danny Cannon and written by William Wisher Junior and Steven E. de Souza. It stars Sylvester Stallone, Armand Assante, Diane Lane, Rob Schneider, Joan Chen, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and Max von Sydow. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Adrian Biddle. Adapted from the Judge Dredd stories in British comic book 2000AD, the plot finds Stallone as Joseph Judge Dredd, a ruthless law enforcer of the future in Mega City 1. Framed for murder, Dredd finds himself on the other side of the fence, literally, as he is sent to prison beyond Mega City 1's walls out in the Cursed Earth. He must somehow escape to clear his name and stop Mega City 1 from becoming corrupted by those that framed him. OK, it's hardly brilliant, Schneider irritates, the real thesps in the film are wasted, it lifts from other notable sci-fi movies, so therefore it's lazy, and it has plot holes galore, but is Judge Dredd worthy of the critical mauling it got? Well no, actually. That is if you take it on its own mindless popcorn terms.... The action is fast paced, it's loud and brash, but not in an insulting way like Batman & Robin, Stallone positively plays it dead right with a glint in his eye and chin perfectly chiselled, Lane is sexy as heck-fire in figure hugging futuristic suit, while the production design, the colour toning and the effects (with one exception) are undervalued eye pleasing delights. Add in Assante having the time of his life as villain of the month psycho Rico Dredd, and it's a more than adequate blockbuster. I understand the fan's reactions, those of the comic book that is, because I'm one of them, I treasured my 2000AD and Starlord copies right into my 20s when I foolishly sold them on. This is without doubt a watered down version of Dredd, clearly caught between a fan director's will and a studio's insistence on popcorn munching appeasement. So it's a fact we don't have the ultra violence and general fascist wallop that permeates 2000AD's stiff backed hard bastard, but their are delicate hints of totalitarianism and Nazi overtones in Cannon's movie, whiffs of satire are there as well. It really isn't the directionless adaptation some insist it is. Many flaws for sure, but it makes for a nice companion piece to the better Demolition Man, for that is the bonkers popcorn world it sits in. A guilty pleasure? Well I don't feel guilty about enjoying Judge Dredd a lot, but yes Mr. Fascist, I'm guilty as charged. 6.5/10
