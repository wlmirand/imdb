  When a rich woman's ex-husband and a tabloid-type reporter turn up just before her planned remarriage, she begins to learn the truth about herself.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Philadelphia socialites Tracy Lord and C.K. Dexter Haven married impulsively, with their marriage and subsequent divorce being equally passionate. They broke up when Dexter's drinking became excessive, it a mechanism to cope with Tracy's unforgiving manner to the imperfect, imperfections which Dexter admits he readily has. Two years after their break-up, Tracy is about to remarry, the ceremony to take place at the Lord mansion. Tracy's bridegroom is nouveau riche businessman and aspiring politician George Kittredge, who is otherwise a rather ordinary man and who idolizes Tracy. The day before the wedding, three unexpected guests show up at the Lord mansion: Macaulay Connor (Mike to his friends), Elizabeth Imbrie - the two who are friends of Tracy's absent brother, Junior - and Dexter himself. Dexter, an employee of the tabloid Spy magazine, made a deal with its publisher and editor Sidney Kidd to get a story on Tracy's wedding - the wedding of the year - in return for Kidd not ...

    "Philadelphia Story" is a film staring three of my favorite actors of all times. Katherine Hepburn is a Philadelphia socialite who had recently recovered form a very traumatic divorce. She was married with Cary Grant, but their relationship had come to an end since she could not cope with his drinking problems and unwillingness to embrace perfection. Mrs. Hepburn's character is a member of the local high society, who sets high standards of behavior for herself and others around her. Therefore she would not tolerate even the slightest scandals within her close circle  a position that typically pushes someone into judging other people for each and every sin. Two years after she claims to have successfully overcome her previous marriage, Mrs. Hepburn announces she is going to re-marry an aspiring member of the jet set, in order to washout the stains from the past and restore balance and harmony to her life. That is when her ex-husband closes a deal with an important tabloid that is keen to have exclusive pictures of the wedding, pry into her personal life and luckily fill out headlines with intimate scandals. The scheme is to be carried out by a reporter and a photographer (James Stewart and Ruth Hussey), pretending to be close friends of the bride's absent brother. The plot is soon unveiled to the bride, but the others are not aware of what is taking place. The bride then starts to play a game of cat-and-mouse with the reporter. They eventually get terribly drunk and the truth literally comes out. It is a wonderful film, highly entertaining and incredibly avant garde. It deals with themes rarely seen in films of the time, such as female emancipation  divorce and re-marriage. It also exposes the industry of gossip, something that has grown to unfathomed levels since the film was released. The acting is also flawless. One of the highlights is the sequence where James Stewart's character, stinking of booze, is talking nonsense. It even deserved a compliment from Mr. Grant in 1985, when Mr. Stewart was awarded with an honorary Oscar. He stated that Mr. Stewart was asked to the scene a couple of times and it always came out impeccable. The man has truly mastered the art. The screenplay is about a journey into self-knowledge. Of course the underlying message is that only love makes us lower our guard and truly discover who we are. It is interesting to notice that this adage is still deemed the main thrust behind romantic comedies. That is not to say that there is just one way of transmitting this idea to the audience. On the contrary, rom-com is a never-extinguishing source for screen-writing and entertainment precisely because there are various forms of telling basically the same story. However, "Philadelphia Story" stands like a beacon over other rom-coms, providing an excellent example of how the genre can be thoughtful about human relations and simultaneously deliver excellent one-liners.

    The Philadelphia Story is a 1940 Comedy film directed by George Cukor and starring Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart. It is often seen in best-movies-ever lists, and is regarded even more frequently as one of the very best and most significant comedies of the 1940's. It is produced by Hollywood legend Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and is based on the play of the same name released a year prior to the film and shown on Broadway. Tracy (Katharine Hepburn) is an upper class woman who is about to remarry to a wealthy man of the people, George Kittredge. She already has another marriage behind her back, with another upper class-man (Cary Grant), but it ended up with a divorce because of his drinking problem. With the intent to sabotage the event, the ex-husband calls a journalist (James Stewart) to report on the wedding. The night before the wedding will drastically change the position of the to-be-wife because of this journalist. This movie is remembered as a classic for mainly one reason: the brilliant, witty and funny script. It unleashes some of the best dialogue of those years, and several quotes can be taken out of it because of how memorable they are. The actors don't do a bad job in delivering them either: the three main actor's exuberance and vivacity enlighten the atmosphere even more, with the help of other minor character such as the little girl or Tracy's father. It is a perfect example of a Romantic Comedy from the forties, of its sense of humor and its theatrical construct. It is in this last point though where the movie falls a bit; the first half of the film is overly theatrical and at the same time uneventful, with nothing really sticking up to be fun to watch. It is the second half of the movie that really saves it from narrative stagnation, and the viewer's eyes and ears are helplessly glued to what happens on the screen. The ending, like many movies of the time, ends in the absurd and unpredictable. Despite being an overall good movie, especially thanks to the second half, it doesn't have much of an artistic value compared to other comedies of the time. It has an amazing script and good, fun acting, but for a film to be great, there needs to be so much more than that.

    George Cukor directs "The Philadelphia Story". Now regarded as a classic, the films stars Katherine Hepburn as a wealthy socialite who clashes with tabloid reporters, ex lovers and her soon-to-be husband. The film was marketed as a satire, but isn't really. Despite Cukor's attempts at an anti-classist message, the film class condescends and paints Hepburn's working-class fianc&eacute;  a self-made man - as a bit of a buffoon. Still, this is a witty and sparkling film. Based on a Broadway play by Philip Barry, "The Philadelphia Story" overflows with one-liners and snappy dialogue. Characters trade barbs and ripostes like cannon volleys and Cukor's dapper cast do nothing but dazzle and sparkle and crackle with electricity. Iconic actors of the era are sprinkled about  Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant etc  but its Katharine Hepburn's performance that's typically the most celebrated (the NY Film Critics Circle gave her a best actress award for her role). Hepburn was a bit of an oddity in real life. A tomboy, the child of activist parents, very intelligent and rumoured to be gay or bisexual, the roles she played typically mirrored her own life. They're well educated characters, aloof, intelligent, confident, modern, sophisticated, share her preference for trousers over skirts (radical at the time), and of course are always distrustful of men. Able to cut men down to size with their brains, shrill voice and razor-sharp wit, Hepburn's characters quickly led to her becoming a feminist icon (and much later, a gay and lesbian icon). Her characters didn't need men, didn't even seem to need sex (indeed they were often sexually frigid) and were almost always fully independent and autonomous. That is, of course, until the final acts of her films. Almost all her characters are eventually beaten down, tamed and subjugated by lowbrow, carnal, earthly men. The most overt examples are perhaps "The African Queen" and "The Rainmaker", but we see this in "The Philadelphia Story" as well, in which Hepburn reigns for three acts before being domesticated and restored to a safe position. Incidentally, Cukor was himself homosexual. He'd work with Hepburn on a number of pictures, as well as Spencer Tracy and Cary Grant, all of whom faced allegations of homosexuality and/or bisexuality. Cukor's work, like that of Douglas Sirk (also rumoured to be gay), was frequently disparaged in the past. He was deemed a director of "mere women's pictures". Today both have been rehabilitated by film historians, who celebrate the duo for capturing various social undercurrents, psychological or gender complexities. Indeed, most of Cukor's films feature female protagonists, have a feminine sensibility and are told from a woman's point-of-view. Even when he'd drift into traditionally masculine genres, like his western, "Heller in Pink Tights", the style employed would be bizarrely vibrant, almost camp, with lavish colours, opulent sets and women in chief roles. And of course Cukor was responsible for one of the earliest gender bending films. Released in 1936, "Sylvia Scarlett" starred Hepburn again as a rule breaker who masquerades as a boy and attracts sexual attention from both women and men. Filled with sexual misunderstandings and "coming outs", the film, like Cukor's best films, had a hint of autobiography. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    George Cukor's "The Philadelphia Story" was released in 1940 and starred the ultimate Hollywood trinity: Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant. Being a romantic comedy, we suspect she will end up with one of these two. And since she's about to marry a boring guy named George, we quickly understand that she will not marry him, and that the whole story will consist on leading us to that conclusion in two hours, two endlessly and unstoppably long hours. I hate to use the word 'overrated' and 'overacted' so I guess the wrong mindset would be an inevitable obstacle between this movie and me. Being the average schmuck I am, I couldn't relate to Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord, a young and wealthy socialite praised, adored, worshiped by the other schmucks of her community. For my biggest displeasure, I couldn't even relate to James Stewart because as much as I loved his roles in Capra films, I didn't find any invitation for empathy in his character as Macaulay Connor, the wannabe writer and tabloid journalist for a magazine fittingly named 'Spy". I could care about Cary Grant as C.K. (as in 'CocKy) Dexter Morgan, the ex-husband, if only for the hilarious way he palms Tracy's face and pushes her down to the floor. But isn't it a bad omen when the film's most memorable instant happens within the first minute. But despite the brilliance of the gesture and the male charisma he naturally exuded, in that particular film, he seemed rather lifeless to me, bored by the whole gossipy environment (I can't blame him) and only there to recite his lines, to create a false impression of chemistry with Tracy. I couldn't stand his constant grin, but not as much as Hepburn's trademark 'Bryn Mawr" accent (thanks IMDb) that got quickly on my nerves, this 'yawr', 'dahling' or this expression as if she wanted us to check if she had salad stuck in her teeth. But don't take my iconoclasm very seriously, I'm an unexceptional reviewer. In fact, I'm so mediocre, compared to these icons I dare to criticize that I even rooted for John Howard's character as George Kettridge, the target of a whole conspiracy from the director, the writer and the actors. They spared no efforts to mock and belittle George, he was a hypocrite, an ambitious man, but I have to see it to believe it, after all, neither Grant or Connor had better intentions and George seemed a rather decent man. Anyway, they were all so mean-spirited than my immediate reaction was to take his side. At least, in usual screwball comedies, it's one rival against another; here the guy has no chance standing against the two men and his own fianc&eacute; plotting against him. And watching the beautiful Tracy Lord swinging back and forth from Connor to Morgan like a tennis ball was embarrassing, not to mention the ludicrous ending. "Marry me, Tracy", she's reluctant because it wouldn't please his girlfriend photographer Liz (Ruth Hussey). Naturally, Liz doesn't mind being used as a Plan B, nor does Tracy to get back to her precedent husband. Damn, I'm almost glad Georgie got himself out of this mess. The film had its moments though, I liked the part where Stewart pretended to be drunk and you could see at one moment that both him and Grant were trying not to laugh, that was my favorite moment of the film: it was genuine, charming and innocent and it allowed us to forget about the intricacy of the plot. Speaking of that 'drunk' scene, I'm not sure either that Stewart deserved the Oscar, I know it was a compensation for his loss in 1939, but seriously was he better than Henry Fonda in "Grapes of Wrath", or even as a comedic performance, was he better than Charlie Chaplin in "The Great Dictator"? I could concede anything to the movie, maybe if I watched it a third or fourth time, I will end up believing it's a masterpiece, but I don't think I would praise Stewart's performance, I didn't even think it was worthy of a nomination. The writing also won an Oscar, but then again, it's adapted from a play, it has the kind of prefabricated wit that was overexploited in screwball classics, but for some reason, I don't think these kinds of artificial exchange fit the silver screen. Maybe it's the whole vaudeville thing, but I grew rapidly tired of these dialogs where you get the feeling that each character is trying to outsmart the other, and naturally, George is the biggest target, he receives them and seems incapable to say one word or two to Grant or Stewart. From funny, it gets incredibly redundant and ruins the poignancy or the intelligent lucidity some scenes genuinely provides. Granted it's not meant to be realistic, and people have to be entertained, but at one point, it's just words, words, words, or like would say Hepburn "wohds, wohds, wohds". And I guess I've seen enough classics not to feel guilty about this one. And please, don't get me started on the so-called feminist undertones just because Hepburn plays a very strong and outspoken character. If one thing, the film proves (and quite realistically) that a woman can be as strong, as bossy, as a bully as a man IF she's rich. It attacks the core of feminism, which is the perpetual antagonism between men and women by showing that it's only a matter of rich vs. poor. It's funny how the film works better as a social commentary, and it's only by realizing that she wouldn't live with a man who'd prevent her from freedom by letting her drink and loosen up, that Tracy goes with the rich guy, of course, only rich can afford to be decadent. "There goes George", sings Grant to ridicule him, just ignore them, George, you're the unsung hero of "The Philadelphia Story"

    "The Philadelphia Story" is a classic, romantic comedy that features a dash of wit and a strong cast of actors. The concept of three men vying for a women's attention has been a bit overplayed in recent years (think "This Means War," "Twilight," "10 Things I Hate about You") but "The Philadelphia Story" did it right first. Tracy Lord, played by actress Katherine Hepburn, set the bar high as she plays the role with elegance, smarts and humor. Tracy is a fiercely independent woman with her own opinion and Hepburn embodies her from the length of her perfect posture to the confident stride of her walk. The other stand-out character whose charm radiates from the screen via his overprotective persona (even though he violently pushes Hepburn to the ground in the very first scene) is Cary Grant, who plays Tracy's ex-husband. Later on in the film, Grant follows up with more violence as he punches a suitor of Tracy to prove a point to her fianc&eacute;e. When he can't find the words to handle a situation, Grant turns to violence. Growing up, I was taught that violence never solves problems, but apparently Grant had a more interesting home life as a kid. Wealth, class, and exploitation are common motifs that circulate the plot. In a pivotal scene, that shows of Tracy's swift, logical thinking skills, the family learns that the journalists are from Spy Magazine, a tabloid. Due to the family's wealth, the tabloid violates the family's privacy just as the ex violates Tracy's privacy by trying to manipulate he. The celebrity concepts of tabloids and live-in journalists reminded me of the reality shows popular in today's culture. Just as most reality shows progress, the family attempted to be on their best behavior at first, but eventually their true personalities came out. I didn't realize that the concepts of tabloids and paparazzi were prevalent in society this early on. Alcohol is also a reoccurring problem. Alcohol was the reason behind Tracy and her ex-husbands divorce and later on serves as a factor that pushes her new relationship off the edge. At least with my exposure to film, Tracy's alcohol usage is a symptom of a good-girl-gone-bad trend, like in "Mean Girls". In most young adult rebellion films, alcohol contributes to the downfall of innocence. Therefore, in "The Philadelphia Story," alcohol is behind Tracy's mistakes and enlightenment. While I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and the clothing styles of the film, I was a bit put off by the Sexism. I know that women were not treated equally to men in this time era but Tracy was put down by her own father when she shared her opinions and regarded as a Goddess by her male suitors. I don't think she had any radical ideas so I am not sure what all the fuss was about.I also don't understand why it was Tracy's responsibility to make up a story just so her dad wouldn't get in trouble. I guess the wealthy went to great lengths to protect their public perceptions back in the day too. A great portion of this film was dedicated to watching Tracy grow into her own person. I almost find that I am internalizing a backwards message because messages in today's society are tend to relate to women finding their own way through independence and Tracy goes from being independent and outspoken to being almost pressured to marry her ex at the last minute. Nonetheless, Tracy has been plucked from the wilderness and planted in a pot. Through the usage of alcohol and an invasion of privacy, Tracy is no longer the free-spirited, wild blossom she was at the start of the film. She now knows the dangers of outside forces and has decided to settle down with a husband instead of facing the world on her own.

    Firstly, I watched this as a Korean import DVD, which is quite a bit cheaper but possibly, of inferior quality. There's only one disc, for starters and once subtitles have been switched off, plays like any other, though reviewers have mentioned the excellent transfer of the version advertised. This one is very good, thankfully without the dreaded juddery panning shots that I so often suffer with Korean ones, but it's not as crisp as I know other films of this period can be. Philadelphia Story is undoubtedly an evergreen classic. The getting drunk scenes with Katherine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart and the romantic "results" are sent from heaven, the chemistry, Jimmy's famous drawl, the shimmering lighting - beautiful and touching. Magic. This film can be seen countless times; its mixture of satire, romance, comedy and sheer story have probably never been bettered on screen. That it features three of the biggest acting stars on the planet at the time, who actually DO get on with each other, no off-set personality clashes (that I'm aware of) that might spill over into the scenes, creates a real sense of ease and naturalness. Philly Story is essential viewing to all true lovers of film - even if it's not your usual fare, it's an example of how to make a film. For fans of either Grant, Hepburn or Stewart, you've been missing a great deal and seeing them together WILL change your life, well, at least your enjoyment of it!

    IMDb Top 250: 248 The Philadelphia Story is a nice film, a classic comedy with lots of good jokes and heavy star power. Not much commitment is needed to enjoy it, and it can make for a fun afternoon. It's a light rom-com with a few serious scenes. It falls squarely into the category of "see if it it's there, but not worth going out of your way to see". The scene is set with a 'reporter' team going to cover a socialite's wedding with the bride-to-be's ex as a guide: humour, romance and "innundo" ensure. The pace is relaxed throughout, with a slump around the 45 minute mark, but it is made up for by a strong last 45, and an ending that tosses a few twists right until the very end. 'Philadelphia' is worth your time because of its characters and their excellent dialogue. Tracy Lord (Katherine Hepburn) is a socialite, a Kim Kardashian of her day, apparently famous for no reason. She's an unsure woman, stemming from her parents' uncertainties, with a wry sense of humour. Macaulay (James Stewart) is one bitter writer, appearing angry until he turns into the kind Jimmy Stewart we love- and gets some great lines. Best Actor worthy though? Nah. Lastly Carey Grant plays the ex, put in a funny position. He's likable and well- handled. The Philadelphia Story has an unfortunate sticker attached to it: it came out in the same year as The Great Dictator. If you check out my review for that, you can see I like it just a little bit, just my favourite comedy of all time. If you asked which of these two films was better, I would choose The Great Dictator every time. While 'Philadelphia' is mostly concerned with telling a story, I found a recurring theme of 'invasion'. The media invades the home's privacy. The ex invades Tracy's privacy. The films shows alcohol influence over the body, and is important to the plot. Lastly, the uncle and the camera women. Maybe this is a coincidence, but it's a good one. Again, the focus of the film is telling a story and making you snicker, where it succeeds. If you like classics or the three major stars attached to this film, you'll like this well made film. 8.0/10

    The Philadelphia Story is about this. When a rich woman's ex-husband and a tabloid-type reporter turn up just before her planned remarriage, she begins to learn the truth about herself. Having watched this only a few weeks ago, I FINALLY am going to give my review on it. In my point of view, The Philadelphia Story is a great movie, it is a great romantic comedy film that is timeless, unforgettable, and a smashing good time! As a matter of fact, this movie is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all time, and not only that, but it is also one of the greatest movies of all time! Why did I want to see this movie in the first place? Because of all of the great things that I have heard about it, as well as the fact that it stars three of the greatest stars of all time, Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart. Every single one of the great things that have been said about this movie are true, it certainly is one of the best movies of all time! The great acting, the great directing, and the humor is proof of that, when you watch this movie, you'll see what I mean. Here's a few things that I have to say about the acting. In his only Oscar Winning performance, Jimmy Stewart (one of my all time favorite actors) shines. He plays a reporter who is getting some information about the wedding of Katharine Hepburn's character. Stewart was outstanding, he totally deserved the Oscar that he won. Cary Grant's performance is also nothing to sneeze at. In fact, Cary Grant could play a wide variety of characters, from comedy roles like this one and Arsenic and Old Lace, to serious roles like Notorious and North By Northwest. And of course Katarine Hepburn deserves mention as well. It is no surprise that the AFI ranked her the greatest female star of all time, because that is a ranking that she totally and completely deserved! So all in all, the great cast are yet another thing that contribute to the greatness of this movie! Not to mention that George Cukor did a great job directing this movie, he directed it in top form! Well anyway, The Philadelphia Story is another movie that I would call a great movie, it is not only one of the best romantic comedy movies ever made, but also one of the best movie movies ever made! This is also another one of those movies that you'll have to see over and over again, as you will love it when you see it for the first time! I am awarding this movie a rating of ten stars out of ten for being a perfect romantic comedy movie that did not disappoint me at all! Considering all of the great things that have been said about this movie, that means that you've got to see it! When you watch this, be prepared to see Katharine Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart, and Cary Grant at the top of their game! The Philadelphia Story is a masterpiece, one of the greatest movies ever made, directed by one of the greatest directors of all time, and starring three of the greatest actors of all time. 10/10

    This is the film that put Hepburn's career back on the map after being labeled "box office poison". It really is a nice film, with strong performances throughout, especially Hepburn as the aristocratic but uptight Tracy Lord. And she has seldom looked more beautiful than she does here; dressed to the nines in elegant dresses by Adrian and her famous red hair coiffed by Sydney Guilaroff. I did think that Ruth Hussey's character has too many smart-alecky lines; it makes her come across as if she is trying too hard. And I also take issue with the premise that Tracy Lord's father blames his daughter's attitude and disrespect toward him as reason for his infidelities to his wife  even when I saw this as a child, I didn't understand why an independent- minded (if a little uptight and controlling) woman would have to account for her dad's cheating. Such a load of BS. I know that we are supposed to take delight in these types of Hepburn films, where her high and mighty characters get humbled by those closest to them, and suddenly she becomes a "female". It makes for some good laughs, but it can also be really condescending and more than a bit sexist. I got the same impression in Woman of the Year as well. And finally, I still shake my head in disbelief that Jimmy Stewart was awarded a Best Actor Oscar for what essentially is a supporting role, and not really of Oscar caliber. I'll always believe that the Best Actor statue should have gone to Henry Fonda. Flaws aside, The Philadelphia Story has some great moments

    "Philadelphia Story" is a film staring three of my favorite actors of all times. Katherine Hepburn is a Philadelphia socialite who had recently recovered form a very traumatic divorce. She was married with Cary Grant, but their relationship had come to an end since she could not cope with his drinking problems and unwillingness to embrace perfection. Mrs. Hepburn's character is a member of the local high society, who sets high standards of behavior for herself and others around her. Therefore she would not tolerate even the slightest scandals within her close circle  a position that typically pushes someone into judging other people for each and every sin. Two years after she claims to have successfully overcome her previous marriage, Mrs. Hepburn announces she is going to re-marry an aspiring member of the jet set, in order to washout the stains from the past and restore balance and harmony to her life. That is when her ex-husband closes a deal with an important tabloid that is keen to have exclusive pictures of the wedding, pry into her personal life and luckily fill out headlines with intimate scandals. The scheme is to be carried out by a reporter and a photographer (James Stewart and Ruth Hussey), pretending to be close friends of the bride's absent brother. The plot is soon unveiled to the bride, but the others are not aware of what is taking place. The bride then starts to play a game of cat-and-mouse with the reporter. They eventually get terribly drunk and the truth literally comes out. It is a wonderful film, highly entertaining and incredibly avant garde. It deals with themes rarely seen in films of the time, such as female emancipation  divorce and re-marriage. It also exposes the industry of gossip, something that has grown to unfathomed levels since the film was released. The acting is also flawless. One of the highlights is the sequence where James Stewart's character, stinking of booze, is talking nonsense. It even deserved a compliment from Mr. Grant in 1985, when Mr. Stewart was awarded with an honorary Oscar. He stated that Mr. Stewart was asked to the scene a couple of times and it always came out impeccable. The man has truly mastered the art. The screenplay is about a journey into self-knowledge. Of course the underlying message is that only love makes us lower our guard and truly discover who we are. It is interesting to notice that this adage is still deemed the main thrust behind romantic comedies. That is not to say that there is just one way of transmitting this idea to the audience. On the contrary, rom-com is a never-extinguishing source for screen-writing and entertainment precisely because there are various forms of telling basically the same story. However, "Philadelphia Story" stands like a beacon over other rom-coms, providing an excellent example of how the genre can be thoughtful about human relations and simultaneously deliver excellent one-liners.

    The Philadelphia Story is a 1940 Comedy film directed by George Cukor and starring Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart. It is often seen in best-movies-ever lists, and is regarded even more frequently as one of the very best and most significant comedies of the 1940's. It is produced by Hollywood legend Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and is based on the play of the same name released a year prior to the film and shown on Broadway. Tracy (Katharine Hepburn) is an upper class woman who is about to remarry to a wealthy man of the people, George Kittredge. She already has another marriage behind her back, with another upper class-man (Cary Grant), but it ended up with a divorce because of his drinking problem. With the intent to sabotage the event, the ex-husband calls a journalist (James Stewart) to report on the wedding. The night before the wedding will drastically change the position of the to-be-wife because of this journalist. This movie is remembered as a classic for mainly one reason: the brilliant, witty and funny script. It unleashes some of the best dialogue of those years, and several quotes can be taken out of it because of how memorable they are. The actors don't do a bad job in delivering them either: the three main actor's exuberance and vivacity enlighten the atmosphere even more, with the help of other minor character such as the little girl or Tracy's father. It is a perfect example of a Romantic Comedy from the forties, of its sense of humor and its theatrical construct. It is in this last point though where the movie falls a bit; the first half of the film is overly theatrical and at the same time uneventful, with nothing really sticking up to be fun to watch. It is the second half of the movie that really saves it from narrative stagnation, and the viewer's eyes and ears are helplessly glued to what happens on the screen. The ending, like many movies of the time, ends in the absurd and unpredictable. Despite being an overall good movie, especially thanks to the second half, it doesn't have much of an artistic value compared to other comedies of the time. It has an amazing script and good, fun acting, but for a film to be great, there needs to be so much more than that.

    George Cukor directs "The Philadelphia Story". Now regarded as a classic, the films stars Katherine Hepburn as a wealthy socialite who clashes with tabloid reporters, ex lovers and her soon-to-be husband. The film was marketed as a satire, but isn't really. Despite Cukor's attempts at an anti-classist message, the film class condescends and paints Hepburn's working-class fianc&eacute;  a self-made man - as a bit of a buffoon. Still, this is a witty and sparkling film. Based on a Broadway play by Philip Barry, "The Philadelphia Story" overflows with one-liners and snappy dialogue. Characters trade barbs and ripostes like cannon volleys and Cukor's dapper cast do nothing but dazzle and sparkle and crackle with electricity. Iconic actors of the era are sprinkled about  Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant etc  but its Katharine Hepburn's performance that's typically the most celebrated (the NY Film Critics Circle gave her a best actress award for her role). Hepburn was a bit of an oddity in real life. A tomboy, the child of activist parents, very intelligent and rumoured to be gay or bisexual, the roles she played typically mirrored her own life. They're well educated characters, aloof, intelligent, confident, modern, sophisticated, share her preference for trousers over skirts (radical at the time), and of course are always distrustful of men. Able to cut men down to size with their brains, shrill voice and razor-sharp wit, Hepburn's characters quickly led to her becoming a feminist icon (and much later, a gay and lesbian icon). Her characters didn't need men, didn't even seem to need sex (indeed they were often sexually frigid) and were almost always fully independent and autonomous. That is, of course, until the final acts of her films. Almost all her characters are eventually beaten down, tamed and subjugated by lowbrow, carnal, earthly men. The most overt examples are perhaps "The African Queen" and "The Rainmaker", but we see this in "The Philadelphia Story" as well, in which Hepburn reigns for three acts before being domesticated and restored to a safe position. Incidentally, Cukor was himself homosexual. He'd work with Hepburn on a number of pictures, as well as Spencer Tracy and Cary Grant, all of whom faced allegations of homosexuality and/or bisexuality. Cukor's work, like that of Douglas Sirk (also rumoured to be gay), was frequently disparaged in the past. He was deemed a director of "mere women's pictures". Today both have been rehabilitated by film historians, who celebrate the duo for capturing various social undercurrents, psychological or gender complexities. Indeed, most of Cukor's films feature female protagonists, have a feminine sensibility and are told from a woman's point-of-view. Even when he'd drift into traditionally masculine genres, like his western, "Heller in Pink Tights", the style employed would be bizarrely vibrant, almost camp, with lavish colours, opulent sets and women in chief roles. And of course Cukor was responsible for one of the earliest gender bending films. Released in 1936, "Sylvia Scarlett" starred Hepburn again as a rule breaker who masquerades as a boy and attracts sexual attention from both women and men. Filled with sexual misunderstandings and "coming outs", the film, like Cukor's best films, had a hint of autobiography. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    George Cukor's "The Philadelphia Story" was released in 1940 and starred the ultimate Hollywood trinity: Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant. Being a romantic comedy, we suspect she will end up with one of these two. And since she's about to marry a boring guy named George, we quickly understand that she will not marry him, and that the whole story will consist on leading us to that conclusion in two hours, two endlessly and unstoppably long hours. I hate to use the word 'overrated' and 'overacted' so I guess the wrong mindset would be an inevitable obstacle between this movie and me. Being the average schmuck I am, I couldn't relate to Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord, a young and wealthy socialite praised, adored, worshiped by the other schmucks of her community. For my biggest displeasure, I couldn't even relate to James Stewart because as much as I loved his roles in Capra films, I didn't find any invitation for empathy in his character as Macaulay Connor, the wannabe writer and tabloid journalist for a magazine fittingly named 'Spy". I could care about Cary Grant as C.K. (as in 'CocKy) Dexter Morgan, the ex-husband, if only for the hilarious way he palms Tracy's face and pushes her down to the floor. But isn't it a bad omen when the film's most memorable instant happens within the first minute. But despite the brilliance of the gesture and the male charisma he naturally exuded, in that particular film, he seemed rather lifeless to me, bored by the whole gossipy environment (I can't blame him) and only there to recite his lines, to create a false impression of chemistry with Tracy. I couldn't stand his constant grin, but not as much as Hepburn's trademark 'Bryn Mawr" accent (thanks IMDb) that got quickly on my nerves, this 'yawr', 'dahling' or this expression as if she wanted us to check if she had salad stuck in her teeth. But don't take my iconoclasm very seriously, I'm an unexceptional reviewer. In fact, I'm so mediocre, compared to these icons I dare to criticize that I even rooted for John Howard's character as George Kettridge, the target of a whole conspiracy from the director, the writer and the actors. They spared no efforts to mock and belittle George, he was a hypocrite, an ambitious man, but I have to see it to believe it, after all, neither Grant or Connor had better intentions and George seemed a rather decent man. Anyway, they were all so mean-spirited than my immediate reaction was to take his side. At least, in usual screwball comedies, it's one rival against another; here the guy has no chance standing against the two men and his own fianc&eacute; plotting against him. And watching the beautiful Tracy Lord swinging back and forth from Connor to Morgan like a tennis ball was embarrassing, not to mention the ludicrous ending. "Marry me, Tracy", she's reluctant because it wouldn't please his girlfriend photographer Liz (Ruth Hussey). Naturally, Liz doesn't mind being used as a Plan B, nor does Tracy to get back to her precedent husband. Damn, I'm almost glad Georgie got himself out of this mess. The film had its moments though, I liked the part where Stewart pretended to be drunk and you could see at one moment that both him and Grant were trying not to laugh, that was my favorite moment of the film: it was genuine, charming and innocent and it allowed us to forget about the intricacy of the plot. Speaking of that 'drunk' scene, I'm not sure either that Stewart deserved the Oscar, I know it was a compensation for his loss in 1939, but seriously was he better than Henry Fonda in "Grapes of Wrath", or even as a comedic performance, was he better than Charlie Chaplin in "The Great Dictator"? I could concede anything to the movie, maybe if I watched it a third or fourth time, I will end up believing it's a masterpiece, but I don't think I would praise Stewart's performance, I didn't even think it was worthy of a nomination. The writing also won an Oscar, but then again, it's adapted from a play, it has the kind of prefabricated wit that was overexploited in screwball classics, but for some reason, I don't think these kinds of artificial exchange fit the silver screen. Maybe it's the whole vaudeville thing, but I grew rapidly tired of these dialogs where you get the feeling that each character is trying to outsmart the other, and naturally, George is the biggest target, he receives them and seems incapable to say one word or two to Grant or Stewart. From funny, it gets incredibly redundant and ruins the poignancy or the intelligent lucidity some scenes genuinely provides. Granted it's not meant to be realistic, and people have to be entertained, but at one point, it's just words, words, words, or like would say Hepburn "wohds, wohds, wohds". And I guess I've seen enough classics not to feel guilty about this one. And please, don't get me started on the so-called feminist undertones just because Hepburn plays a very strong and outspoken character. If one thing, the film proves (and quite realistically) that a woman can be as strong, as bossy, as a bully as a man IF she's rich. It attacks the core of feminism, which is the perpetual antagonism between men and women by showing that it's only a matter of rich vs. poor. It's funny how the film works better as a social commentary, and it's only by realizing that she wouldn't live with a man who'd prevent her from freedom by letting her drink and loosen up, that Tracy goes with the rich guy, of course, only rich can afford to be decadent. "There goes George", sings Grant to ridicule him, just ignore them, George, you're the unsung hero of "The Philadelphia Story"

    "The Philadelphia Story" is a classic, romantic comedy that features a dash of wit and a strong cast of actors. The concept of three men vying for a women's attention has been a bit overplayed in recent years (think "This Means War," "Twilight," "10 Things I Hate about You") but "The Philadelphia Story" did it right first. Tracy Lord, played by actress Katherine Hepburn, set the bar high as she plays the role with elegance, smarts and humor. Tracy is a fiercely independent woman with her own opinion and Hepburn embodies her from the length of her perfect posture to the confident stride of her walk. The other stand-out character whose charm radiates from the screen via his overprotective persona (even though he violently pushes Hepburn to the ground in the very first scene) is Cary Grant, who plays Tracy's ex-husband. Later on in the film, Grant follows up with more violence as he punches a suitor of Tracy to prove a point to her fianc&eacute;e. When he can't find the words to handle a situation, Grant turns to violence. Growing up, I was taught that violence never solves problems, but apparently Grant had a more interesting home life as a kid. Wealth, class, and exploitation are common motifs that circulate the plot. In a pivotal scene, that shows of Tracy's swift, logical thinking skills, the family learns that the journalists are from Spy Magazine, a tabloid. Due to the family's wealth, the tabloid violates the family's privacy just as the ex violates Tracy's privacy by trying to manipulate he. The celebrity concepts of tabloids and live-in journalists reminded me of the reality shows popular in today's culture. Just as most reality shows progress, the family attempted to be on their best behavior at first, but eventually their true personalities came out. I didn't realize that the concepts of tabloids and paparazzi were prevalent in society this early on. Alcohol is also a reoccurring problem. Alcohol was the reason behind Tracy and her ex-husbands divorce and later on serves as a factor that pushes her new relationship off the edge. At least with my exposure to film, Tracy's alcohol usage is a symptom of a good-girl-gone-bad trend, like in "Mean Girls". In most young adult rebellion films, alcohol contributes to the downfall of innocence. Therefore, in "The Philadelphia Story," alcohol is behind Tracy's mistakes and enlightenment. While I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and the clothing styles of the film, I was a bit put off by the Sexism. I know that women were not treated equally to men in this time era but Tracy was put down by her own father when she shared her opinions and regarded as a Goddess by her male suitors. I don't think she had any radical ideas so I am not sure what all the fuss was about.I also don't understand why it was Tracy's responsibility to make up a story just so her dad wouldn't get in trouble. I guess the wealthy went to great lengths to protect their public perceptions back in the day too. A great portion of this film was dedicated to watching Tracy grow into her own person. I almost find that I am internalizing a backwards message because messages in today's society are tend to relate to women finding their own way through independence and Tracy goes from being independent and outspoken to being almost pressured to marry her ex at the last minute. Nonetheless, Tracy has been plucked from the wilderness and planted in a pot. Through the usage of alcohol and an invasion of privacy, Tracy is no longer the free-spirited, wild blossom she was at the start of the film. She now knows the dangers of outside forces and has decided to settle down with a husband instead of facing the world on her own.

    Firstly, I watched this as a Korean import DVD, which is quite a bit cheaper but possibly, of inferior quality. There's only one disc, for starters and once subtitles have been switched off, plays like any other, though reviewers have mentioned the excellent transfer of the version advertised. This one is very good, thankfully without the dreaded juddery panning shots that I so often suffer with Korean ones, but it's not as crisp as I know other films of this period can be. Philadelphia Story is undoubtedly an evergreen classic. The getting drunk scenes with Katherine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart and the romantic "results" are sent from heaven, the chemistry, Jimmy's famous drawl, the shimmering lighting - beautiful and touching. Magic. This film can be seen countless times; its mixture of satire, romance, comedy and sheer story have probably never been bettered on screen. That it features three of the biggest acting stars on the planet at the time, who actually DO get on with each other, no off-set personality clashes (that I'm aware of) that might spill over into the scenes, creates a real sense of ease and naturalness. Philly Story is essential viewing to all true lovers of film - even if it's not your usual fare, it's an example of how to make a film. For fans of either Grant, Hepburn or Stewart, you've been missing a great deal and seeing them together WILL change your life, well, at least your enjoyment of it!

    IMDb Top 250: 248 The Philadelphia Story is a nice film, a classic comedy with lots of good jokes and heavy star power. Not much commitment is needed to enjoy it, and it can make for a fun afternoon. It's a light rom-com with a few serious scenes. It falls squarely into the category of "see if it it's there, but not worth going out of your way to see". The scene is set with a 'reporter' team going to cover a socialite's wedding with the bride-to-be's ex as a guide: humour, romance and "innundo" ensure. The pace is relaxed throughout, with a slump around the 45 minute mark, but it is made up for by a strong last 45, and an ending that tosses a few twists right until the very end. 'Philadelphia' is worth your time because of its characters and their excellent dialogue. Tracy Lord (Katherine Hepburn) is a socialite, a Kim Kardashian of her day, apparently famous for no reason. She's an unsure woman, stemming from her parents' uncertainties, with a wry sense of humour. Macaulay (James Stewart) is one bitter writer, appearing angry until he turns into the kind Jimmy Stewart we love- and gets some great lines. Best Actor worthy though? Nah. Lastly Carey Grant plays the ex, put in a funny position. He's likable and well- handled. The Philadelphia Story has an unfortunate sticker attached to it: it came out in the same year as The Great Dictator. If you check out my review for that, you can see I like it just a little bit, just my favourite comedy of all time. If you asked which of these two films was better, I would choose The Great Dictator every time. While 'Philadelphia' is mostly concerned with telling a story, I found a recurring theme of 'invasion'. The media invades the home's privacy. The ex invades Tracy's privacy. The films shows alcohol influence over the body, and is important to the plot. Lastly, the uncle and the camera women. Maybe this is a coincidence, but it's a good one. Again, the focus of the film is telling a story and making you snicker, where it succeeds. If you like classics or the three major stars attached to this film, you'll like this well made film. 8.0/10

    The Philadelphia Story is about this. When a rich woman's ex-husband and a tabloid-type reporter turn up just before her planned remarriage, she begins to learn the truth about herself. Having watched this only a few weeks ago, I FINALLY am going to give my review on it. In my point of view, The Philadelphia Story is a great movie, it is a great romantic comedy film that is timeless, unforgettable, and a smashing good time! As a matter of fact, this movie is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all time, and not only that, but it is also one of the greatest movies of all time! Why did I want to see this movie in the first place? Because of all of the great things that I have heard about it, as well as the fact that it stars three of the greatest stars of all time, Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart. Every single one of the great things that have been said about this movie are true, it certainly is one of the best movies of all time! The great acting, the great directing, and the humor is proof of that, when you watch this movie, you'll see what I mean. Here's a few things that I have to say about the acting. In his only Oscar Winning performance, Jimmy Stewart (one of my all time favorite actors) shines. He plays a reporter who is getting some information about the wedding of Katharine Hepburn's character. Stewart was outstanding, he totally deserved the Oscar that he won. Cary Grant's performance is also nothing to sneeze at. In fact, Cary Grant could play a wide variety of characters, from comedy roles like this one and Arsenic and Old Lace, to serious roles like Notorious and North By Northwest. And of course Katarine Hepburn deserves mention as well. It is no surprise that the AFI ranked her the greatest female star of all time, because that is a ranking that she totally and completely deserved! So all in all, the great cast are yet another thing that contribute to the greatness of this movie! Not to mention that George Cukor did a great job directing this movie, he directed it in top form! Well anyway, The Philadelphia Story is another movie that I would call a great movie, it is not only one of the best romantic comedy movies ever made, but also one of the best movie movies ever made! This is also another one of those movies that you'll have to see over and over again, as you will love it when you see it for the first time! I am awarding this movie a rating of ten stars out of ten for being a perfect romantic comedy movie that did not disappoint me at all! Considering all of the great things that have been said about this movie, that means that you've got to see it! When you watch this, be prepared to see Katharine Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart, and Cary Grant at the top of their game! The Philadelphia Story is a masterpiece, one of the greatest movies ever made, directed by one of the greatest directors of all time, and starring three of the greatest actors of all time. 10/10

    This is the film that put Hepburn's career back on the map after being labeled "box office poison". It really is a nice film, with strong performances throughout, especially Hepburn as the aristocratic but uptight Tracy Lord. And she has seldom looked more beautiful than she does here; dressed to the nines in elegant dresses by Adrian and her famous red hair coiffed by Sydney Guilaroff. I did think that Ruth Hussey's character has too many smart-alecky lines; it makes her come across as if she is trying too hard. And I also take issue with the premise that Tracy Lord's father blames his daughter's attitude and disrespect toward him as reason for his infidelities to his wife  even when I saw this as a child, I didn't understand why an independent- minded (if a little uptight and controlling) woman would have to account for her dad's cheating. Such a load of BS. I know that we are supposed to take delight in these types of Hepburn films, where her high and mighty characters get humbled by those closest to them, and suddenly she becomes a "female". It makes for some good laughs, but it can also be really condescending and more than a bit sexist. I got the same impression in Woman of the Year as well. And finally, I still shake my head in disbelief that Jimmy Stewart was awarded a Best Actor Oscar for what essentially is a supporting role, and not really of Oscar caliber. I'll always believe that the Best Actor statue should have gone to Henry Fonda. Flaws aside, The Philadelphia Story has some great moments

    rare gem. for script and cast. for nuances and joy. for spirit and smart solutions. for music and performance. for subtle references and for each scene. it is difficult to say something about it because it represents total show. a show who seduce and amuse and define reality with few drops of wise and humor, pink romance and cold precise. and the great virtue is the science to show and use the gift, the art and the delicate manner to create force, soul and shadow of character by Hepburn, Grant and Steward. it can be a surprise. or a delight. it is not important the final verdict because it is only a state of sensibility. a movie. testimony of another time and flavor of admirable work.

    "Philadelphia Story" is a film staring three of my favorite actors of all times. Katherine Hepburn is a Philadelphia socialite who had recently recovered form a very traumatic divorce. She was married with Cary Grant, but their relationship had come to an end since she could not cope with his drinking problems and unwillingness to embrace perfection. Mrs. Hepburn's character is a member of the local high society, who sets high standards of behavior for herself and others around her. Therefore she would not tolerate even the slightest scandals within her close circle  a position that typically pushes someone into judging other people for each and every sin. Two years after she claims to have successfully overcome her previous marriage, Mrs. Hepburn announces she is going to re-marry an aspiring member of the jet set, in order to washout the stains from the past and restore balance and harmony to her life. That is when her ex-husband closes a deal with an important tabloid that is keen to have exclusive pictures of the wedding, pry into her personal life and luckily fill out headlines with intimate scandals. The scheme is to be carried out by a reporter and a photographer (James Stewart and Ruth Hussey), pretending to be close friends of the bride's absent brother. The plot is soon unveiled to the bride, but the others are not aware of what is taking place. The bride then starts to play a game of cat-and-mouse with the reporter. They eventually get terribly drunk and the truth literally comes out. It is a wonderful film, highly entertaining and incredibly avant garde. It deals with themes rarely seen in films of the time, such as female emancipation  divorce and re-marriage. It also exposes the industry of gossip, something that has grown to unfathomed levels since the film was released. The acting is also flawless. One of the highlights is the sequence where James Stewart's character, stinking of booze, is talking nonsense. It even deserved a compliment from Mr. Grant in 1985, when Mr. Stewart was awarded with an honorary Oscar. He stated that Mr. Stewart was asked to the scene a couple of times and it always came out impeccable. The man has truly mastered the art. The screenplay is about a journey into self-knowledge. Of course the underlying message is that only love makes us lower our guard and truly discover who we are. It is interesting to notice that this adage is still deemed the main thrust behind romantic comedies. That is not to say that there is just one way of transmitting this idea to the audience. On the contrary, rom-com is a never-extinguishing source for screen-writing and entertainment precisely because there are various forms of telling basically the same story. However, "Philadelphia Story" stands like a beacon over other rom-coms, providing an excellent example of how the genre can be thoughtful about human relations and simultaneously deliver excellent one-liners.

    The Philadelphia Story is a 1940 Comedy film directed by George Cukor and starring Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart. It is often seen in best-movies-ever lists, and is regarded even more frequently as one of the very best and most significant comedies of the 1940's. It is produced by Hollywood legend Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and is based on the play of the same name released a year prior to the film and shown on Broadway. Tracy (Katharine Hepburn) is an upper class woman who is about to remarry to a wealthy man of the people, George Kittredge. She already has another marriage behind her back, with another upper class-man (Cary Grant), but it ended up with a divorce because of his drinking problem. With the intent to sabotage the event, the ex-husband calls a journalist (James Stewart) to report on the wedding. The night before the wedding will drastically change the position of the to-be-wife because of this journalist. This movie is remembered as a classic for mainly one reason: the brilliant, witty and funny script. It unleashes some of the best dialogue of those years, and several quotes can be taken out of it because of how memorable they are. The actors don't do a bad job in delivering them either: the three main actor's exuberance and vivacity enlighten the atmosphere even more, with the help of other minor character such as the little girl or Tracy's father. It is a perfect example of a Romantic Comedy from the forties, of its sense of humor and its theatrical construct. It is in this last point though where the movie falls a bit; the first half of the film is overly theatrical and at the same time uneventful, with nothing really sticking up to be fun to watch. It is the second half of the movie that really saves it from narrative stagnation, and the viewer's eyes and ears are helplessly glued to what happens on the screen. The ending, like many movies of the time, ends in the absurd and unpredictable. Despite being an overall good movie, especially thanks to the second half, it doesn't have much of an artistic value compared to other comedies of the time. It has an amazing script and good, fun acting, but for a film to be great, there needs to be so much more than that.

    George Cukor directs "The Philadelphia Story". Now regarded as a classic, the films stars Katherine Hepburn as a wealthy socialite who clashes with tabloid reporters, ex lovers and her soon-to-be husband. The film was marketed as a satire, but isn't really. Despite Cukor's attempts at an anti-classist message, the film class condescends and paints Hepburn's working-class fianc&eacute;  a self-made man - as a bit of a buffoon. Still, this is a witty and sparkling film. Based on a Broadway play by Philip Barry, "The Philadelphia Story" overflows with one-liners and snappy dialogue. Characters trade barbs and ripostes like cannon volleys and Cukor's dapper cast do nothing but dazzle and sparkle and crackle with electricity. Iconic actors of the era are sprinkled about  Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant etc  but its Katharine Hepburn's performance that's typically the most celebrated (the NY Film Critics Circle gave her a best actress award for her role). Hepburn was a bit of an oddity in real life. A tomboy, the child of activist parents, very intelligent and rumoured to be gay or bisexual, the roles she played typically mirrored her own life. They're well educated characters, aloof, intelligent, confident, modern, sophisticated, share her preference for trousers over skirts (radical at the time), and of course are always distrustful of men. Able to cut men down to size with their brains, shrill voice and razor-sharp wit, Hepburn's characters quickly led to her becoming a feminist icon (and much later, a gay and lesbian icon). Her characters didn't need men, didn't even seem to need sex (indeed they were often sexually frigid) and were almost always fully independent and autonomous. That is, of course, until the final acts of her films. Almost all her characters are eventually beaten down, tamed and subjugated by lowbrow, carnal, earthly men. The most overt examples are perhaps "The African Queen" and "The Rainmaker", but we see this in "The Philadelphia Story" as well, in which Hepburn reigns for three acts before being domesticated and restored to a safe position. Incidentally, Cukor was himself homosexual. He'd work with Hepburn on a number of pictures, as well as Spencer Tracy and Cary Grant, all of whom faced allegations of homosexuality and/or bisexuality. Cukor's work, like that of Douglas Sirk (also rumoured to be gay), was frequently disparaged in the past. He was deemed a director of "mere women's pictures". Today both have been rehabilitated by film historians, who celebrate the duo for capturing various social undercurrents, psychological or gender complexities. Indeed, most of Cukor's films feature female protagonists, have a feminine sensibility and are told from a woman's point-of-view. Even when he'd drift into traditionally masculine genres, like his western, "Heller in Pink Tights", the style employed would be bizarrely vibrant, almost camp, with lavish colours, opulent sets and women in chief roles. And of course Cukor was responsible for one of the earliest gender bending films. Released in 1936, "Sylvia Scarlett" starred Hepburn again as a rule breaker who masquerades as a boy and attracts sexual attention from both women and men. Filled with sexual misunderstandings and "coming outs", the film, like Cukor's best films, had a hint of autobiography. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    George Cukor's "The Philadelphia Story" was released in 1940 and starred the ultimate Hollywood trinity: Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant. Being a romantic comedy, we suspect she will end up with one of these two. And since she's about to marry a boring guy named George, we quickly understand that she will not marry him, and that the whole story will consist on leading us to that conclusion in two hours, two endlessly and unstoppably long hours. I hate to use the word 'overrated' and 'overacted' so I guess the wrong mindset would be an inevitable obstacle between this movie and me. Being the average schmuck I am, I couldn't relate to Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord, a young and wealthy socialite praised, adored, worshiped by the other schmucks of her community. For my biggest displeasure, I couldn't even relate to James Stewart because as much as I loved his roles in Capra films, I didn't find any invitation for empathy in his character as Macaulay Connor, the wannabe writer and tabloid journalist for a magazine fittingly named 'Spy". I could care about Cary Grant as C.K. (as in 'CocKy) Dexter Morgan, the ex-husband, if only for the hilarious way he palms Tracy's face and pushes her down to the floor. But isn't it a bad omen when the film's most memorable instant happens within the first minute. But despite the brilliance of the gesture and the male charisma he naturally exuded, in that particular film, he seemed rather lifeless to me, bored by the whole gossipy environment (I can't blame him) and only there to recite his lines, to create a false impression of chemistry with Tracy. I couldn't stand his constant grin, but not as much as Hepburn's trademark 'Bryn Mawr" accent (thanks IMDb) that got quickly on my nerves, this 'yawr', 'dahling' or this expression as if she wanted us to check if she had salad stuck in her teeth. But don't take my iconoclasm very seriously, I'm an unexceptional reviewer. In fact, I'm so mediocre, compared to these icons I dare to criticize that I even rooted for John Howard's character as George Kettridge, the target of a whole conspiracy from the director, the writer and the actors. They spared no efforts to mock and belittle George, he was a hypocrite, an ambitious man, but I have to see it to believe it, after all, neither Grant or Connor had better intentions and George seemed a rather decent man. Anyway, they were all so mean-spirited than my immediate reaction was to take his side. At least, in usual screwball comedies, it's one rival against another; here the guy has no chance standing against the two men and his own fianc&eacute; plotting against him. And watching the beautiful Tracy Lord swinging back and forth from Connor to Morgan like a tennis ball was embarrassing, not to mention the ludicrous ending. "Marry me, Tracy", she's reluctant because it wouldn't please his girlfriend photographer Liz (Ruth Hussey). Naturally, Liz doesn't mind being used as a Plan B, nor does Tracy to get back to her precedent husband. Damn, I'm almost glad Georgie got himself out of this mess. The film had its moments though, I liked the part where Stewart pretended to be drunk and you could see at one moment that both him and Grant were trying not to laugh, that was my favorite moment of the film: it was genuine, charming and innocent and it allowed us to forget about the intricacy of the plot. Speaking of that 'drunk' scene, I'm not sure either that Stewart deserved the Oscar, I know it was a compensation for his loss in 1939, but seriously was he better than Henry Fonda in "Grapes of Wrath", or even as a comedic performance, was he better than Charlie Chaplin in "The Great Dictator"? I could concede anything to the movie, maybe if I watched it a third or fourth time, I will end up believing it's a masterpiece, but I don't think I would praise Stewart's performance, I didn't even think it was worthy of a nomination. The writing also won an Oscar, but then again, it's adapted from a play, it has the kind of prefabricated wit that was overexploited in screwball classics, but for some reason, I don't think these kinds of artificial exchange fit the silver screen. Maybe it's the whole vaudeville thing, but I grew rapidly tired of these dialogs where you get the feeling that each character is trying to outsmart the other, and naturally, George is the biggest target, he receives them and seems incapable to say one word or two to Grant or Stewart. From funny, it gets incredibly redundant and ruins the poignancy or the intelligent lucidity some scenes genuinely provides. Granted it's not meant to be realistic, and people have to be entertained, but at one point, it's just words, words, words, or like would say Hepburn "wohds, wohds, wohds". And I guess I've seen enough classics not to feel guilty about this one. And please, don't get me started on the so-called feminist undertones just because Hepburn plays a very strong and outspoken character. If one thing, the film proves (and quite realistically) that a woman can be as strong, as bossy, as a bully as a man IF she's rich. It attacks the core of feminism, which is the perpetual antagonism between men and women by showing that it's only a matter of rich vs. poor. It's funny how the film works better as a social commentary, and it's only by realizing that she wouldn't live with a man who'd prevent her from freedom by letting her drink and loosen up, that Tracy goes with the rich guy, of course, only rich can afford to be decadent. "There goes George", sings Grant to ridicule him, just ignore them, George, you're the unsung hero of "The Philadelphia Story"

    "The Philadelphia Story" is a classic, romantic comedy that features a dash of wit and a strong cast of actors. The concept of three men vying for a women's attention has been a bit overplayed in recent years (think "This Means War," "Twilight," "10 Things I Hate about You") but "The Philadelphia Story" did it right first. Tracy Lord, played by actress Katherine Hepburn, set the bar high as she plays the role with elegance, smarts and humor. Tracy is a fiercely independent woman with her own opinion and Hepburn embodies her from the length of her perfect posture to the confident stride of her walk. The other stand-out character whose charm radiates from the screen via his overprotective persona (even though he violently pushes Hepburn to the ground in the very first scene) is Cary Grant, who plays Tracy's ex-husband. Later on in the film, Grant follows up with more violence as he punches a suitor of Tracy to prove a point to her fianc&eacute;e. When he can't find the words to handle a situation, Grant turns to violence. Growing up, I was taught that violence never solves problems, but apparently Grant had a more interesting home life as a kid. Wealth, class, and exploitation are common motifs that circulate the plot. In a pivotal scene, that shows of Tracy's swift, logical thinking skills, the family learns that the journalists are from Spy Magazine, a tabloid. Due to the family's wealth, the tabloid violates the family's privacy just as the ex violates Tracy's privacy by trying to manipulate he. The celebrity concepts of tabloids and live-in journalists reminded me of the reality shows popular in today's culture. Just as most reality shows progress, the family attempted to be on their best behavior at first, but eventually their true personalities came out. I didn't realize that the concepts of tabloids and paparazzi were prevalent in society this early on. Alcohol is also a reoccurring problem. Alcohol was the reason behind Tracy and her ex-husbands divorce and later on serves as a factor that pushes her new relationship off the edge. At least with my exposure to film, Tracy's alcohol usage is a symptom of a good-girl-gone-bad trend, like in "Mean Girls". In most young adult rebellion films, alcohol contributes to the downfall of innocence. Therefore, in "The Philadelphia Story," alcohol is behind Tracy's mistakes and enlightenment. While I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and the clothing styles of the film, I was a bit put off by the Sexism. I know that women were not treated equally to men in this time era but Tracy was put down by her own father when she shared her opinions and regarded as a Goddess by her male suitors. I don't think she had any radical ideas so I am not sure what all the fuss was about.I also don't understand why it was Tracy's responsibility to make up a story just so her dad wouldn't get in trouble. I guess the wealthy went to great lengths to protect their public perceptions back in the day too. A great portion of this film was dedicated to watching Tracy grow into her own person. I almost find that I am internalizing a backwards message because messages in today's society are tend to relate to women finding their own way through independence and Tracy goes from being independent and outspoken to being almost pressured to marry her ex at the last minute. Nonetheless, Tracy has been plucked from the wilderness and planted in a pot. Through the usage of alcohol and an invasion of privacy, Tracy is no longer the free-spirited, wild blossom she was at the start of the film. She now knows the dangers of outside forces and has decided to settle down with a husband instead of facing the world on her own.

    Firstly, I watched this as a Korean import DVD, which is quite a bit cheaper but possibly, of inferior quality. There's only one disc, for starters and once subtitles have been switched off, plays like any other, though reviewers have mentioned the excellent transfer of the version advertised. This one is very good, thankfully without the dreaded juddery panning shots that I so often suffer with Korean ones, but it's not as crisp as I know other films of this period can be. Philadelphia Story is undoubtedly an evergreen classic. The getting drunk scenes with Katherine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart and the romantic "results" are sent from heaven, the chemistry, Jimmy's famous drawl, the shimmering lighting - beautiful and touching. Magic. This film can be seen countless times; its mixture of satire, romance, comedy and sheer story have probably never been bettered on screen. That it features three of the biggest acting stars on the planet at the time, who actually DO get on with each other, no off-set personality clashes (that I'm aware of) that might spill over into the scenes, creates a real sense of ease and naturalness. Philly Story is essential viewing to all true lovers of film - even if it's not your usual fare, it's an example of how to make a film. For fans of either Grant, Hepburn or Stewart, you've been missing a great deal and seeing them together WILL change your life, well, at least your enjoyment of it!

    IMDb Top 250: 248 The Philadelphia Story is a nice film, a classic comedy with lots of good jokes and heavy star power. Not much commitment is needed to enjoy it, and it can make for a fun afternoon. It's a light rom-com with a few serious scenes. It falls squarely into the category of "see if it it's there, but not worth going out of your way to see". The scene is set with a 'reporter' team going to cover a socialite's wedding with the bride-to-be's ex as a guide: humour, romance and "innundo" ensure. The pace is relaxed throughout, with a slump around the 45 minute mark, but it is made up for by a strong last 45, and an ending that tosses a few twists right until the very end. 'Philadelphia' is worth your time because of its characters and their excellent dialogue. Tracy Lord (Katherine Hepburn) is a socialite, a Kim Kardashian of her day, apparently famous for no reason. She's an unsure woman, stemming from her parents' uncertainties, with a wry sense of humour. Macaulay (James Stewart) is one bitter writer, appearing angry until he turns into the kind Jimmy Stewart we love- and gets some great lines. Best Actor worthy though? Nah. Lastly Carey Grant plays the ex, put in a funny position. He's likable and well- handled. The Philadelphia Story has an unfortunate sticker attached to it: it came out in the same year as The Great Dictator. If you check out my review for that, you can see I like it just a little bit, just my favourite comedy of all time. If you asked which of these two films was better, I would choose The Great Dictator every time. While 'Philadelphia' is mostly concerned with telling a story, I found a recurring theme of 'invasion'. The media invades the home's privacy. The ex invades Tracy's privacy. The films shows alcohol influence over the body, and is important to the plot. Lastly, the uncle and the camera women. Maybe this is a coincidence, but it's a good one. Again, the focus of the film is telling a story and making you snicker, where it succeeds. If you like classics or the three major stars attached to this film, you'll like this well made film. 8.0/10

    The Philadelphia Story is about this. When a rich woman's ex-husband and a tabloid-type reporter turn up just before her planned remarriage, she begins to learn the truth about herself. Having watched this only a few weeks ago, I FINALLY am going to give my review on it. In my point of view, The Philadelphia Story is a great movie, it is a great romantic comedy film that is timeless, unforgettable, and a smashing good time! As a matter of fact, this movie is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all time, and not only that, but it is also one of the greatest movies of all time! Why did I want to see this movie in the first place? Because of all of the great things that I have heard about it, as well as the fact that it stars three of the greatest stars of all time, Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart. Every single one of the great things that have been said about this movie are true, it certainly is one of the best movies of all time! The great acting, the great directing, and the humor is proof of that, when you watch this movie, you'll see what I mean. Here's a few things that I have to say about the acting. In his only Oscar Winning performance, Jimmy Stewart (one of my all time favorite actors) shines. He plays a reporter who is getting some information about the wedding of Katharine Hepburn's character. Stewart was outstanding, he totally deserved the Oscar that he won. Cary Grant's performance is also nothing to sneeze at. In fact, Cary Grant could play a wide variety of characters, from comedy roles like this one and Arsenic and Old Lace, to serious roles like Notorious and North By Northwest. And of course Katarine Hepburn deserves mention as well. It is no surprise that the AFI ranked her the greatest female star of all time, because that is a ranking that she totally and completely deserved! So all in all, the great cast are yet another thing that contribute to the greatness of this movie! Not to mention that George Cukor did a great job directing this movie, he directed it in top form! Well anyway, The Philadelphia Story is another movie that I would call a great movie, it is not only one of the best romantic comedy movies ever made, but also one of the best movie movies ever made! This is also another one of those movies that you'll have to see over and over again, as you will love it when you see it for the first time! I am awarding this movie a rating of ten stars out of ten for being a perfect romantic comedy movie that did not disappoint me at all! Considering all of the great things that have been said about this movie, that means that you've got to see it! When you watch this, be prepared to see Katharine Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart, and Cary Grant at the top of their game! The Philadelphia Story is a masterpiece, one of the greatest movies ever made, directed by one of the greatest directors of all time, and starring three of the greatest actors of all time. 10/10

    This is the film that put Hepburn's career back on the map after being labeled "box office poison". It really is a nice film, with strong performances throughout, especially Hepburn as the aristocratic but uptight Tracy Lord. And she has seldom looked more beautiful than she does here; dressed to the nines in elegant dresses by Adrian and her famous red hair coiffed by Sydney Guilaroff. I did think that Ruth Hussey's character has too many smart-alecky lines; it makes her come across as if she is trying too hard. And I also take issue with the premise that Tracy Lord's father blames his daughter's attitude and disrespect toward him as reason for his infidelities to his wife  even when I saw this as a child, I didn't understand why an independent- minded (if a little uptight and controlling) woman would have to account for her dad's cheating. Such a load of BS. I know that we are supposed to take delight in these types of Hepburn films, where her high and mighty characters get humbled by those closest to them, and suddenly she becomes a "female". It makes for some good laughs, but it can also be really condescending and more than a bit sexist. I got the same impression in Woman of the Year as well. And finally, I still shake my head in disbelief that Jimmy Stewart was awarded a Best Actor Oscar for what essentially is a supporting role, and not really of Oscar caliber. I'll always believe that the Best Actor statue should have gone to Henry Fonda. Flaws aside, The Philadelphia Story has some great moments

    rare gem. for script and cast. for nuances and joy. for spirit and smart solutions. for music and performance. for subtle references and for each scene. it is difficult to say something about it because it represents total show. a show who seduce and amuse and define reality with few drops of wise and humor, pink romance and cold precise. and the great virtue is the science to show and use the gift, the art and the delicate manner to create force, soul and shadow of character by Hepburn, Grant and Steward. it can be a surprise. or a delight. it is not important the final verdict because it is only a state of sensibility. a movie. testimony of another time and flavor of admirable work.

    "Philadelphia Story" is a film staring three of my favorite actors of all times. Katherine Hepburn is a Philadelphia socialite who had recently recovered form a very traumatic divorce. She was married with Cary Grant, but their relationship had come to an end since she could not cope with his drinking problems and unwillingness to embrace perfection. Mrs. Hepburn's character is a member of the local high society, who sets high standards of behavior for herself and others around her. Therefore she would not tolerate even the slightest scandals within her close circle  a position that typically pushes someone into judging other people for each and every sin. Two years after she claims to have successfully overcome her previous marriage, Mrs. Hepburn announces she is going to re-marry an aspiring member of the jet set, in order to washout the stains from the past and restore balance and harmony to her life. That is when her ex-husband closes a deal with an important tabloid that is keen to have exclusive pictures of the wedding, pry into her personal life and luckily fill out headlines with intimate scandals. The scheme is to be carried out by a reporter and a photographer (James Stewart and Ruth Hussey), pretending to be close friends of the bride's absent brother. The plot is soon unveiled to the bride, but the others are not aware of what is taking place. The bride then starts to play a game of cat-and-mouse with the reporter. They eventually get terribly drunk and the truth literally comes out. It is a wonderful film, highly entertaining and incredibly avant garde. It deals with themes rarely seen in films of the time, such as female emancipation  divorce and re-marriage. It also exposes the industry of gossip, something that has grown to unfathomed levels since the film was released. The acting is also flawless. One of the highlights is the sequence where James Stewart's character, stinking of booze, is talking nonsense. It even deserved a compliment from Mr. Grant in 1985, when Mr. Stewart was awarded with an honorary Oscar. He stated that Mr. Stewart was asked to the scene a couple of times and it always came out impeccable. The man has truly mastered the art. The screenplay is about a journey into self-knowledge. Of course the underlying message is that only love makes us lower our guard and truly discover who we are. It is interesting to notice that this adage is still deemed the main thrust behind romantic comedies. That is not to say that there is just one way of transmitting this idea to the audience. On the contrary, rom-com is a never-extinguishing source for screen-writing and entertainment precisely because there are various forms of telling basically the same story. However, "Philadelphia Story" stands like a beacon over other rom-coms, providing an excellent example of how the genre can be thoughtful about human relations and simultaneously deliver excellent one-liners.

    The Philadelphia Story is a 1940 Comedy film directed by George Cukor and starring Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart. It is often seen in best-movies-ever lists, and is regarded even more frequently as one of the very best and most significant comedies of the 1940's. It is produced by Hollywood legend Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and is based on the play of the same name released a year prior to the film and shown on Broadway. Tracy (Katharine Hepburn) is an upper class woman who is about to remarry to a wealthy man of the people, George Kittredge. She already has another marriage behind her back, with another upper class-man (Cary Grant), but it ended up with a divorce because of his drinking problem. With the intent to sabotage the event, the ex-husband calls a journalist (James Stewart) to report on the wedding. The night before the wedding will drastically change the position of the to-be-wife because of this journalist. This movie is remembered as a classic for mainly one reason: the brilliant, witty and funny script. It unleashes some of the best dialogue of those years, and several quotes can be taken out of it because of how memorable they are. The actors don't do a bad job in delivering them either: the three main actor's exuberance and vivacity enlighten the atmosphere even more, with the help of other minor character such as the little girl or Tracy's father. It is a perfect example of a Romantic Comedy from the forties, of its sense of humor and its theatrical construct. It is in this last point though where the movie falls a bit; the first half of the film is overly theatrical and at the same time uneventful, with nothing really sticking up to be fun to watch. It is the second half of the movie that really saves it from narrative stagnation, and the viewer's eyes and ears are helplessly glued to what happens on the screen. The ending, like many movies of the time, ends in the absurd and unpredictable. Despite being an overall good movie, especially thanks to the second half, it doesn't have much of an artistic value compared to other comedies of the time. It has an amazing script and good, fun acting, but for a film to be great, there needs to be so much more than that.

    George Cukor directs "The Philadelphia Story". Now regarded as a classic, the films stars Katherine Hepburn as a wealthy socialite who clashes with tabloid reporters, ex lovers and her soon-to-be husband. The film was marketed as a satire, but isn't really. Despite Cukor's attempts at an anti-classist message, the film class condescends and paints Hepburn's working-class fianc&eacute;  a self-made man - as a bit of a buffoon. Still, this is a witty and sparkling film. Based on a Broadway play by Philip Barry, "The Philadelphia Story" overflows with one-liners and snappy dialogue. Characters trade barbs and ripostes like cannon volleys and Cukor's dapper cast do nothing but dazzle and sparkle and crackle with electricity. Iconic actors of the era are sprinkled about  Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant etc  but its Katharine Hepburn's performance that's typically the most celebrated (the NY Film Critics Circle gave her a best actress award for her role). Hepburn was a bit of an oddity in real life. A tomboy, the child of activist parents, very intelligent and rumoured to be gay or bisexual, the roles she played typically mirrored her own life. They're well educated characters, aloof, intelligent, confident, modern, sophisticated, share her preference for trousers over skirts (radical at the time), and of course are always distrustful of men. Able to cut men down to size with their brains, shrill voice and razor-sharp wit, Hepburn's characters quickly led to her becoming a feminist icon (and much later, a gay and lesbian icon). Her characters didn't need men, didn't even seem to need sex (indeed they were often sexually frigid) and were almost always fully independent and autonomous. That is, of course, until the final acts of her films. Almost all her characters are eventually beaten down, tamed and subjugated by lowbrow, carnal, earthly men. The most overt examples are perhaps "The African Queen" and "The Rainmaker", but we see this in "The Philadelphia Story" as well, in which Hepburn reigns for three acts before being domesticated and restored to a safe position. Incidentally, Cukor was himself homosexual. He'd work with Hepburn on a number of pictures, as well as Spencer Tracy and Cary Grant, all of whom faced allegations of homosexuality and/or bisexuality. Cukor's work, like that of Douglas Sirk (also rumoured to be gay), was frequently disparaged in the past. He was deemed a director of "mere women's pictures". Today both have been rehabilitated by film historians, who celebrate the duo for capturing various social undercurrents, psychological or gender complexities. Indeed, most of Cukor's films feature female protagonists, have a feminine sensibility and are told from a woman's point-of-view. Even when he'd drift into traditionally masculine genres, like his western, "Heller in Pink Tights", the style employed would be bizarrely vibrant, almost camp, with lavish colours, opulent sets and women in chief roles. And of course Cukor was responsible for one of the earliest gender bending films. Released in 1936, "Sylvia Scarlett" starred Hepburn again as a rule breaker who masquerades as a boy and attracts sexual attention from both women and men. Filled with sexual misunderstandings and "coming outs", the film, like Cukor's best films, had a hint of autobiography. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    George Cukor's "The Philadelphia Story" was released in 1940 and starred the ultimate Hollywood trinity: Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant. Being a romantic comedy, we suspect she will end up with one of these two. And since she's about to marry a boring guy named George, we quickly understand that she will not marry him, and that the whole story will consist on leading us to that conclusion in two hours, two endlessly and unstoppably long hours. I hate to use the word 'overrated' and 'overacted' so I guess the wrong mindset would be an inevitable obstacle between this movie and me. Being the average schmuck I am, I couldn't relate to Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord, a young and wealthy socialite praised, adored, worshiped by the other schmucks of her community. For my biggest displeasure, I couldn't even relate to James Stewart because as much as I loved his roles in Capra films, I didn't find any invitation for empathy in his character as Macaulay Connor, the wannabe writer and tabloid journalist for a magazine fittingly named 'Spy". I could care about Cary Grant as C.K. (as in 'CocKy) Dexter Morgan, the ex-husband, if only for the hilarious way he palms Tracy's face and pushes her down to the floor. But isn't it a bad omen when the film's most memorable instant happens within the first minute. But despite the brilliance of the gesture and the male charisma he naturally exuded, in that particular film, he seemed rather lifeless to me, bored by the whole gossipy environment (I can't blame him) and only there to recite his lines, to create a false impression of chemistry with Tracy. I couldn't stand his constant grin, but not as much as Hepburn's trademark 'Bryn Mawr" accent (thanks IMDb) that got quickly on my nerves, this 'yawr', 'dahling' or this expression as if she wanted us to check if she had salad stuck in her teeth. But don't take my iconoclasm very seriously, I'm an unexceptional reviewer. In fact, I'm so mediocre, compared to these icons I dare to criticize that I even rooted for John Howard's character as George Kettridge, the target of a whole conspiracy from the director, the writer and the actors. They spared no efforts to mock and belittle George, he was a hypocrite, an ambitious man, but I have to see it to believe it, after all, neither Grant or Connor had better intentions and George seemed a rather decent man. Anyway, they were all so mean-spirited than my immediate reaction was to take his side. At least, in usual screwball comedies, it's one rival against another; here the guy has no chance standing against the two men and his own fianc&eacute; plotting against him. And watching the beautiful Tracy Lord swinging back and forth from Connor to Morgan like a tennis ball was embarrassing, not to mention the ludicrous ending. "Marry me, Tracy", she's reluctant because it wouldn't please his girlfriend photographer Liz (Ruth Hussey). Naturally, Liz doesn't mind being used as a Plan B, nor does Tracy to get back to her precedent husband. Damn, I'm almost glad Georgie got himself out of this mess. The film had its moments though, I liked the part where Stewart pretended to be drunk and you could see at one moment that both him and Grant were trying not to laugh, that was my favorite moment of the film: it was genuine, charming and innocent and it allowed us to forget about the intricacy of the plot. Speaking of that 'drunk' scene, I'm not sure either that Stewart deserved the Oscar, I know it was a compensation for his loss in 1939, but seriously was he better than Henry Fonda in "Grapes of Wrath", or even as a comedic performance, was he better than Charlie Chaplin in "The Great Dictator"? I could concede anything to the movie, maybe if I watched it a third or fourth time, I will end up believing it's a masterpiece, but I don't think I would praise Stewart's performance, I didn't even think it was worthy of a nomination. The writing also won an Oscar, but then again, it's adapted from a play, it has the kind of prefabricated wit that was overexploited in screwball classics, but for some reason, I don't think these kinds of artificial exchange fit the silver screen. Maybe it's the whole vaudeville thing, but I grew rapidly tired of these dialogs where you get the feeling that each character is trying to outsmart the other, and naturally, George is the biggest target, he receives them and seems incapable to say one word or two to Grant or Stewart. From funny, it gets incredibly redundant and ruins the poignancy or the intelligent lucidity some scenes genuinely provides. Granted it's not meant to be realistic, and people have to be entertained, but at one point, it's just words, words, words, or like would say Hepburn "wohds, wohds, wohds". And I guess I've seen enough classics not to feel guilty about this one. And please, don't get me started on the so-called feminist undertones just because Hepburn plays a very strong and outspoken character. If one thing, the film proves (and quite realistically) that a woman can be as strong, as bossy, as a bully as a man IF she's rich. It attacks the core of feminism, which is the perpetual antagonism between men and women by showing that it's only a matter of rich vs. poor. It's funny how the film works better as a social commentary, and it's only by realizing that she wouldn't live with a man who'd prevent her from freedom by letting her drink and loosen up, that Tracy goes with the rich guy, of course, only rich can afford to be decadent. "There goes George", sings Grant to ridicule him, just ignore them, George, you're the unsung hero of "The Philadelphia Story"

    "The Philadelphia Story" is a classic, romantic comedy that features a dash of wit and a strong cast of actors. The concept of three men vying for a women's attention has been a bit overplayed in recent years (think "This Means War," "Twilight," "10 Things I Hate about You") but "The Philadelphia Story" did it right first. Tracy Lord, played by actress Katherine Hepburn, set the bar high as she plays the role with elegance, smarts and humor. Tracy is a fiercely independent woman with her own opinion and Hepburn embodies her from the length of her perfect posture to the confident stride of her walk. The other stand-out character whose charm radiates from the screen via his overprotective persona (even though he violently pushes Hepburn to the ground in the very first scene) is Cary Grant, who plays Tracy's ex-husband. Later on in the film, Grant follows up with more violence as he punches a suitor of Tracy to prove a point to her fianc&eacute;e. When he can't find the words to handle a situation, Grant turns to violence. Growing up, I was taught that violence never solves problems, but apparently Grant had a more interesting home life as a kid. Wealth, class, and exploitation are common motifs that circulate the plot. In a pivotal scene, that shows of Tracy's swift, logical thinking skills, the family learns that the journalists are from Spy Magazine, a tabloid. Due to the family's wealth, the tabloid violates the family's privacy just as the ex violates Tracy's privacy by trying to manipulate he. The celebrity concepts of tabloids and live-in journalists reminded me of the reality shows popular in today's culture. Just as most reality shows progress, the family attempted to be on their best behavior at first, but eventually their true personalities came out. I didn't realize that the concepts of tabloids and paparazzi were prevalent in society this early on. Alcohol is also a reoccurring problem. Alcohol was the reason behind Tracy and her ex-husbands divorce and later on serves as a factor that pushes her new relationship off the edge. At least with my exposure to film, Tracy's alcohol usage is a symptom of a good-girl-gone-bad trend, like in "Mean Girls". In most young adult rebellion films, alcohol contributes to the downfall of innocence. Therefore, in "The Philadelphia Story," alcohol is behind Tracy's mistakes and enlightenment. While I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and the clothing styles of the film, I was a bit put off by the Sexism. I know that women were not treated equally to men in this time era but Tracy was put down by her own father when she shared her opinions and regarded as a Goddess by her male suitors. I don't think she had any radical ideas so I am not sure what all the fuss was about.I also don't understand why it was Tracy's responsibility to make up a story just so her dad wouldn't get in trouble. I guess the wealthy went to great lengths to protect their public perceptions back in the day too. A great portion of this film was dedicated to watching Tracy grow into her own person. I almost find that I am internalizing a backwards message because messages in today's society are tend to relate to women finding their own way through independence and Tracy goes from being independent and outspoken to being almost pressured to marry her ex at the last minute. Nonetheless, Tracy has been plucked from the wilderness and planted in a pot. Through the usage of alcohol and an invasion of privacy, Tracy is no longer the free-spirited, wild blossom she was at the start of the film. She now knows the dangers of outside forces and has decided to settle down with a husband instead of facing the world on her own.

    Firstly, I watched this as a Korean import DVD, which is quite a bit cheaper but possibly, of inferior quality. There's only one disc, for starters and once subtitles have been switched off, plays like any other, though reviewers have mentioned the excellent transfer of the version advertised. This one is very good, thankfully without the dreaded juddery panning shots that I so often suffer with Korean ones, but it's not as crisp as I know other films of this period can be. Philadelphia Story is undoubtedly an evergreen classic. The getting drunk scenes with Katherine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart and the romantic "results" are sent from heaven, the chemistry, Jimmy's famous drawl, the shimmering lighting - beautiful and touching. Magic. This film can be seen countless times; its mixture of satire, romance, comedy and sheer story have probably never been bettered on screen. That it features three of the biggest acting stars on the planet at the time, who actually DO get on with each other, no off-set personality clashes (that I'm aware of) that might spill over into the scenes, creates a real sense of ease and naturalness. Philly Story is essential viewing to all true lovers of film - even if it's not your usual fare, it's an example of how to make a film. For fans of either Grant, Hepburn or Stewart, you've been missing a great deal and seeing them together WILL change your life, well, at least your enjoyment of it!

    IMDb Top 250: 248 The Philadelphia Story is a nice film, a classic comedy with lots of good jokes and heavy star power. Not much commitment is needed to enjoy it, and it can make for a fun afternoon. It's a light rom-com with a few serious scenes. It falls squarely into the category of "see if it it's there, but not worth going out of your way to see". The scene is set with a 'reporter' team going to cover a socialite's wedding with the bride-to-be's ex as a guide: humour, romance and "innundo" ensure. The pace is relaxed throughout, with a slump around the 45 minute mark, but it is made up for by a strong last 45, and an ending that tosses a few twists right until the very end. 'Philadelphia' is worth your time because of its characters and their excellent dialogue. Tracy Lord (Katherine Hepburn) is a socialite, a Kim Kardashian of her day, apparently famous for no reason. She's an unsure woman, stemming from her parents' uncertainties, with a wry sense of humour. Macaulay (James Stewart) is one bitter writer, appearing angry until he turns into the kind Jimmy Stewart we love- and gets some great lines. Best Actor worthy though? Nah. Lastly Carey Grant plays the ex, put in a funny position. He's likable and well- handled. The Philadelphia Story has an unfortunate sticker attached to it: it came out in the same year as The Great Dictator. If you check out my review for that, you can see I like it just a little bit, just my favourite comedy of all time. If you asked which of these two films was better, I would choose The Great Dictator every time. While 'Philadelphia' is mostly concerned with telling a story, I found a recurring theme of 'invasion'. The media invades the home's privacy. The ex invades Tracy's privacy. The films shows alcohol influence over the body, and is important to the plot. Lastly, the uncle and the camera women. Maybe this is a coincidence, but it's a good one. Again, the focus of the film is telling a story and making you snicker, where it succeeds. If you like classics or the three major stars attached to this film, you'll like this well made film. 8.0/10

    The Philadelphia Story is about this. When a rich woman's ex-husband and a tabloid-type reporter turn up just before her planned remarriage, she begins to learn the truth about herself. Having watched this only a few weeks ago, I FINALLY am going to give my review on it. In my point of view, The Philadelphia Story is a great movie, it is a great romantic comedy film that is timeless, unforgettable, and a smashing good time! As a matter of fact, this movie is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all time, and not only that, but it is also one of the greatest movies of all time! Why did I want to see this movie in the first place? Because of all of the great things that I have heard about it, as well as the fact that it stars three of the greatest stars of all time, Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart. Every single one of the great things that have been said about this movie are true, it certainly is one of the best movies of all time! The great acting, the great directing, and the humor is proof of that, when you watch this movie, you'll see what I mean. Here's a few things that I have to say about the acting. In his only Oscar Winning performance, Jimmy Stewart (one of my all time favorite actors) shines. He plays a reporter who is getting some information about the wedding of Katharine Hepburn's character. Stewart was outstanding, he totally deserved the Oscar that he won. Cary Grant's performance is also nothing to sneeze at. In fact, Cary Grant could play a wide variety of characters, from comedy roles like this one and Arsenic and Old Lace, to serious roles like Notorious and North By Northwest. And of course Katarine Hepburn deserves mention as well. It is no surprise that the AFI ranked her the greatest female star of all time, because that is a ranking that she totally and completely deserved! So all in all, the great cast are yet another thing that contribute to the greatness of this movie! Not to mention that George Cukor did a great job directing this movie, he directed it in top form! Well anyway, The Philadelphia Story is another movie that I would call a great movie, it is not only one of the best romantic comedy movies ever made, but also one of the best movie movies ever made! This is also another one of those movies that you'll have to see over and over again, as you will love it when you see it for the first time! I am awarding this movie a rating of ten stars out of ten for being a perfect romantic comedy movie that did not disappoint me at all! Considering all of the great things that have been said about this movie, that means that you've got to see it! When you watch this, be prepared to see Katharine Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart, and Cary Grant at the top of their game! The Philadelphia Story is a masterpiece, one of the greatest movies ever made, directed by one of the greatest directors of all time, and starring three of the greatest actors of all time. 10/10

    This is the film that put Hepburn's career back on the map after being labeled "box office poison". It really is a nice film, with strong performances throughout, especially Hepburn as the aristocratic but uptight Tracy Lord. And she has seldom looked more beautiful than she does here; dressed to the nines in elegant dresses by Adrian and her famous red hair coiffed by Sydney Guilaroff. I did think that Ruth Hussey's character has too many smart-alecky lines; it makes her come across as if she is trying too hard. And I also take issue with the premise that Tracy Lord's father blames his daughter's attitude and disrespect toward him as reason for his infidelities to his wife  even when I saw this as a child, I didn't understand why an independent- minded (if a little uptight and controlling) woman would have to account for her dad's cheating. Such a load of BS. I know that we are supposed to take delight in these types of Hepburn films, where her high and mighty characters get humbled by those closest to them, and suddenly she becomes a "female". It makes for some good laughs, but it can also be really condescending and more than a bit sexist. I got the same impression in Woman of the Year as well. And finally, I still shake my head in disbelief that Jimmy Stewart was awarded a Best Actor Oscar for what essentially is a supporting role, and not really of Oscar caliber. I'll always believe that the Best Actor statue should have gone to Henry Fonda. Flaws aside, The Philadelphia Story has some great moments

    rare gem. for script and cast. for nuances and joy. for spirit and smart solutions. for music and performance. for subtle references and for each scene. it is difficult to say something about it because it represents total show. a show who seduce and amuse and define reality with few drops of wise and humor, pink romance and cold precise. and the great virtue is the science to show and use the gift, the art and the delicate manner to create force, soul and shadow of character by Hepburn, Grant and Steward. it can be a surprise. or a delight. it is not important the final verdict because it is only a state of sensibility. a movie. testimony of another time and flavor of admirable work.

    "Philadelphia Story" is a film staring three of my favorite actors of all times. Katherine Hepburn is a Philadelphia socialite who had recently recovered form a very traumatic divorce. She was married with Cary Grant, but their relationship had come to an end since she could not cope with his drinking problems and unwillingness to embrace perfection. Mrs. Hepburn's character is a member of the local high society, who sets high standards of behavior for herself and others around her. Therefore she would not tolerate even the slightest scandals within her close circle  a position that typically pushes someone into judging other people for each and every sin. Two years after she claims to have successfully overcome her previous marriage, Mrs. Hepburn announces she is going to re-marry an aspiring member of the jet set, in order to washout the stains from the past and restore balance and harmony to her life. That is when her ex-husband closes a deal with an important tabloid that is keen to have exclusive pictures of the wedding, pry into her personal life and luckily fill out headlines with intimate scandals. The scheme is to be carried out by a reporter and a photographer (James Stewart and Ruth Hussey), pretending to be close friends of the bride's absent brother. The plot is soon unveiled to the bride, but the others are not aware of what is taking place. The bride then starts to play a game of cat-and-mouse with the reporter. They eventually get terribly drunk and the truth literally comes out. It is a wonderful film, highly entertaining and incredibly avant garde. It deals with themes rarely seen in films of the time, such as female emancipation  divorce and re-marriage. It also exposes the industry of gossip, something that has grown to unfathomed levels since the film was released. The acting is also flawless. One of the highlights is the sequence where James Stewart's character, stinking of booze, is talking nonsense. It even deserved a compliment from Mr. Grant in 1985, when Mr. Stewart was awarded with an honorary Oscar. He stated that Mr. Stewart was asked to the scene a couple of times and it always came out impeccable. The man has truly mastered the art. The screenplay is about a journey into self-knowledge. Of course the underlying message is that only love makes us lower our guard and truly discover who we are. It is interesting to notice that this adage is still deemed the main thrust behind romantic comedies. That is not to say that there is just one way of transmitting this idea to the audience. On the contrary, rom-com is a never-extinguishing source for screen-writing and entertainment precisely because there are various forms of telling basically the same story. However, "Philadelphia Story" stands like a beacon over other rom-coms, providing an excellent example of how the genre can be thoughtful about human relations and simultaneously deliver excellent one-liners.

    The Philadelphia Story is a 1940 Comedy film directed by George Cukor and starring Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart. It is often seen in best-movies-ever lists, and is regarded even more frequently as one of the very best and most significant comedies of the 1940's. It is produced by Hollywood legend Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and is based on the play of the same name released a year prior to the film and shown on Broadway. Tracy (Katharine Hepburn) is an upper class woman who is about to remarry to a wealthy man of the people, George Kittredge. She already has another marriage behind her back, with another upper class-man (Cary Grant), but it ended up with a divorce because of his drinking problem. With the intent to sabotage the event, the ex-husband calls a journalist (James Stewart) to report on the wedding. The night before the wedding will drastically change the position of the to-be-wife because of this journalist. This movie is remembered as a classic for mainly one reason: the brilliant, witty and funny script. It unleashes some of the best dialogue of those years, and several quotes can be taken out of it because of how memorable they are. The actors don't do a bad job in delivering them either: the three main actor's exuberance and vivacity enlighten the atmosphere even more, with the help of other minor character such as the little girl or Tracy's father. It is a perfect example of a Romantic Comedy from the forties, of its sense of humor and its theatrical construct. It is in this last point though where the movie falls a bit; the first half of the film is overly theatrical and at the same time uneventful, with nothing really sticking up to be fun to watch. It is the second half of the movie that really saves it from narrative stagnation, and the viewer's eyes and ears are helplessly glued to what happens on the screen. The ending, like many movies of the time, ends in the absurd and unpredictable. Despite being an overall good movie, especially thanks to the second half, it doesn't have much of an artistic value compared to other comedies of the time. It has an amazing script and good, fun acting, but for a film to be great, there needs to be so much more than that.

    George Cukor directs "The Philadelphia Story". Now regarded as a classic, the films stars Katherine Hepburn as a wealthy socialite who clashes with tabloid reporters, ex lovers and her soon-to-be husband. The film was marketed as a satire, but isn't really. Despite Cukor's attempts at an anti-classist message, the film class condescends and paints Hepburn's working-class fianc&eacute;  a self-made man - as a bit of a buffoon. Still, this is a witty and sparkling film. Based on a Broadway play by Philip Barry, "The Philadelphia Story" overflows with one-liners and snappy dialogue. Characters trade barbs and ripostes like cannon volleys and Cukor's dapper cast do nothing but dazzle and sparkle and crackle with electricity. Iconic actors of the era are sprinkled about  Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant etc  but its Katharine Hepburn's performance that's typically the most celebrated (the NY Film Critics Circle gave her a best actress award for her role). Hepburn was a bit of an oddity in real life. A tomboy, the child of activist parents, very intelligent and rumoured to be gay or bisexual, the roles she played typically mirrored her own life. They're well educated characters, aloof, intelligent, confident, modern, sophisticated, share her preference for trousers over skirts (radical at the time), and of course are always distrustful of men. Able to cut men down to size with their brains, shrill voice and razor-sharp wit, Hepburn's characters quickly led to her becoming a feminist icon (and much later, a gay and lesbian icon). Her characters didn't need men, didn't even seem to need sex (indeed they were often sexually frigid) and were almost always fully independent and autonomous. That is, of course, until the final acts of her films. Almost all her characters are eventually beaten down, tamed and subjugated by lowbrow, carnal, earthly men. The most overt examples are perhaps "The African Queen" and "The Rainmaker", but we see this in "The Philadelphia Story" as well, in which Hepburn reigns for three acts before being domesticated and restored to a safe position. Incidentally, Cukor was himself homosexual. He'd work with Hepburn on a number of pictures, as well as Spencer Tracy and Cary Grant, all of whom faced allegations of homosexuality and/or bisexuality. Cukor's work, like that of Douglas Sirk (also rumoured to be gay), was frequently disparaged in the past. He was deemed a director of "mere women's pictures". Today both have been rehabilitated by film historians, who celebrate the duo for capturing various social undercurrents, psychological or gender complexities. Indeed, most of Cukor's films feature female protagonists, have a feminine sensibility and are told from a woman's point-of-view. Even when he'd drift into traditionally masculine genres, like his western, "Heller in Pink Tights", the style employed would be bizarrely vibrant, almost camp, with lavish colours, opulent sets and women in chief roles. And of course Cukor was responsible for one of the earliest gender bending films. Released in 1936, "Sylvia Scarlett" starred Hepburn again as a rule breaker who masquerades as a boy and attracts sexual attention from both women and men. Filled with sexual misunderstandings and "coming outs", the film, like Cukor's best films, had a hint of autobiography. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    George Cukor's "The Philadelphia Story" was released in 1940 and starred the ultimate Hollywood trinity: Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant. Being a romantic comedy, we suspect she will end up with one of these two. And since she's about to marry a boring guy named George, we quickly understand that she will not marry him, and that the whole story will consist on leading us to that conclusion in two hours, two endlessly and unstoppably long hours. I hate to use the word 'overrated' and 'overacted' so I guess the wrong mindset would be an inevitable obstacle between this movie and me. Being the average schmuck I am, I couldn't relate to Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord, a young and wealthy socialite praised, adored, worshiped by the other schmucks of her community. For my biggest displeasure, I couldn't even relate to James Stewart because as much as I loved his roles in Capra films, I didn't find any invitation for empathy in his character as Macaulay Connor, the wannabe writer and tabloid journalist for a magazine fittingly named 'Spy". I could care about Cary Grant as C.K. (as in 'CocKy) Dexter Morgan, the ex-husband, if only for the hilarious way he palms Tracy's face and pushes her down to the floor. But isn't it a bad omen when the film's most memorable instant happens within the first minute. But despite the brilliance of the gesture and the male charisma he naturally exuded, in that particular film, he seemed rather lifeless to me, bored by the whole gossipy environment (I can't blame him) and only there to recite his lines, to create a false impression of chemistry with Tracy. I couldn't stand his constant grin, but not as much as Hepburn's trademark 'Bryn Mawr" accent (thanks IMDb) that got quickly on my nerves, this 'yawr', 'dahling' or this expression as if she wanted us to check if she had salad stuck in her teeth. But don't take my iconoclasm very seriously, I'm an unexceptional reviewer. In fact, I'm so mediocre, compared to these icons I dare to criticize that I even rooted for John Howard's character as George Kettridge, the target of a whole conspiracy from the director, the writer and the actors. They spared no efforts to mock and belittle George, he was a hypocrite, an ambitious man, but I have to see it to believe it, after all, neither Grant or Connor had better intentions and George seemed a rather decent man. Anyway, they were all so mean-spirited than my immediate reaction was to take his side. At least, in usual screwball comedies, it's one rival against another; here the guy has no chance standing against the two men and his own fianc&eacute; plotting against him. And watching the beautiful Tracy Lord swinging back and forth from Connor to Morgan like a tennis ball was embarrassing, not to mention the ludicrous ending. "Marry me, Tracy", she's reluctant because it wouldn't please his girlfriend photographer Liz (Ruth Hussey). Naturally, Liz doesn't mind being used as a Plan B, nor does Tracy to get back to her precedent husband. Damn, I'm almost glad Georgie got himself out of this mess. The film had its moments though, I liked the part where Stewart pretended to be drunk and you could see at one moment that both him and Grant were trying not to laugh, that was my favorite moment of the film: it was genuine, charming and innocent and it allowed us to forget about the intricacy of the plot. Speaking of that 'drunk' scene, I'm not sure either that Stewart deserved the Oscar, I know it was a compensation for his loss in 1939, but seriously was he better than Henry Fonda in "Grapes of Wrath", or even as a comedic performance, was he better than Charlie Chaplin in "The Great Dictator"? I could concede anything to the movie, maybe if I watched it a third or fourth time, I will end up believing it's a masterpiece, but I don't think I would praise Stewart's performance, I didn't even think it was worthy of a nomination. The writing also won an Oscar, but then again, it's adapted from a play, it has the kind of prefabricated wit that was overexploited in screwball classics, but for some reason, I don't think these kinds of artificial exchange fit the silver screen. Maybe it's the whole vaudeville thing, but I grew rapidly tired of these dialogs where you get the feeling that each character is trying to outsmart the other, and naturally, George is the biggest target, he receives them and seems incapable to say one word or two to Grant or Stewart. From funny, it gets incredibly redundant and ruins the poignancy or the intelligent lucidity some scenes genuinely provides. Granted it's not meant to be realistic, and people have to be entertained, but at one point, it's just words, words, words, or like would say Hepburn "wohds, wohds, wohds". And I guess I've seen enough classics not to feel guilty about this one. And please, don't get me started on the so-called feminist undertones just because Hepburn plays a very strong and outspoken character. If one thing, the film proves (and quite realistically) that a woman can be as strong, as bossy, as a bully as a man IF she's rich. It attacks the core of feminism, which is the perpetual antagonism between men and women by showing that it's only a matter of rich vs. poor. It's funny how the film works better as a social commentary, and it's only by realizing that she wouldn't live with a man who'd prevent her from freedom by letting her drink and loosen up, that Tracy goes with the rich guy, of course, only rich can afford to be decadent. "There goes George", sings Grant to ridicule him, just ignore them, George, you're the unsung hero of "The Philadelphia Story"

    "The Philadelphia Story" is a classic, romantic comedy that features a dash of wit and a strong cast of actors. The concept of three men vying for a women's attention has been a bit overplayed in recent years (think "This Means War," "Twilight," "10 Things I Hate about You") but "The Philadelphia Story" did it right first. Tracy Lord, played by actress Katherine Hepburn, set the bar high as she plays the role with elegance, smarts and humor. Tracy is a fiercely independent woman with her own opinion and Hepburn embodies her from the length of her perfect posture to the confident stride of her walk. The other stand-out character whose charm radiates from the screen via his overprotective persona (even though he violently pushes Hepburn to the ground in the very first scene) is Cary Grant, who plays Tracy's ex-husband. Later on in the film, Grant follows up with more violence as he punches a suitor of Tracy to prove a point to her fianc&eacute;e. When he can't find the words to handle a situation, Grant turns to violence. Growing up, I was taught that violence never solves problems, but apparently Grant had a more interesting home life as a kid. Wealth, class, and exploitation are common motifs that circulate the plot. In a pivotal scene, that shows of Tracy's swift, logical thinking skills, the family learns that the journalists are from Spy Magazine, a tabloid. Due to the family's wealth, the tabloid violates the family's privacy just as the ex violates Tracy's privacy by trying to manipulate he. The celebrity concepts of tabloids and live-in journalists reminded me of the reality shows popular in today's culture. Just as most reality shows progress, the family attempted to be on their best behavior at first, but eventually their true personalities came out. I didn't realize that the concepts of tabloids and paparazzi were prevalent in society this early on. Alcohol is also a reoccurring problem. Alcohol was the reason behind Tracy and her ex-husbands divorce and later on serves as a factor that pushes her new relationship off the edge. At least with my exposure to film, Tracy's alcohol usage is a symptom of a good-girl-gone-bad trend, like in "Mean Girls". In most young adult rebellion films, alcohol contributes to the downfall of innocence. Therefore, in "The Philadelphia Story," alcohol is behind Tracy's mistakes and enlightenment. While I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and the clothing styles of the film, I was a bit put off by the Sexism. I know that women were not treated equally to men in this time era but Tracy was put down by her own father when she shared her opinions and regarded as a Goddess by her male suitors. I don't think she had any radical ideas so I am not sure what all the fuss was about.I also don't understand why it was Tracy's responsibility to make up a story just so her dad wouldn't get in trouble. I guess the wealthy went to great lengths to protect their public perceptions back in the day too. A great portion of this film was dedicated to watching Tracy grow into her own person. I almost find that I am internalizing a backwards message because messages in today's society are tend to relate to women finding their own way through independence and Tracy goes from being independent and outspoken to being almost pressured to marry her ex at the last minute. Nonetheless, Tracy has been plucked from the wilderness and planted in a pot. Through the usage of alcohol and an invasion of privacy, Tracy is no longer the free-spirited, wild blossom she was at the start of the film. She now knows the dangers of outside forces and has decided to settle down with a husband instead of facing the world on her own.

    Firstly, I watched this as a Korean import DVD, which is quite a bit cheaper but possibly, of inferior quality. There's only one disc, for starters and once subtitles have been switched off, plays like any other, though reviewers have mentioned the excellent transfer of the version advertised. This one is very good, thankfully without the dreaded juddery panning shots that I so often suffer with Korean ones, but it's not as crisp as I know other films of this period can be. Philadelphia Story is undoubtedly an evergreen classic. The getting drunk scenes with Katherine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart and the romantic "results" are sent from heaven, the chemistry, Jimmy's famous drawl, the shimmering lighting - beautiful and touching. Magic. This film can be seen countless times; its mixture of satire, romance, comedy and sheer story have probably never been bettered on screen. That it features three of the biggest acting stars on the planet at the time, who actually DO get on with each other, no off-set personality clashes (that I'm aware of) that might spill over into the scenes, creates a real sense of ease and naturalness. Philly Story is essential viewing to all true lovers of film - even if it's not your usual fare, it's an example of how to make a film. For fans of either Grant, Hepburn or Stewart, you've been missing a great deal and seeing them together WILL change your life, well, at least your enjoyment of it!

    IMDb Top 250: 248 The Philadelphia Story is a nice film, a classic comedy with lots of good jokes and heavy star power. Not much commitment is needed to enjoy it, and it can make for a fun afternoon. It's a light rom-com with a few serious scenes. It falls squarely into the category of "see if it it's there, but not worth going out of your way to see". The scene is set with a 'reporter' team going to cover a socialite's wedding with the bride-to-be's ex as a guide: humour, romance and "innundo" ensure. The pace is relaxed throughout, with a slump around the 45 minute mark, but it is made up for by a strong last 45, and an ending that tosses a few twists right until the very end. 'Philadelphia' is worth your time because of its characters and their excellent dialogue. Tracy Lord (Katherine Hepburn) is a socialite, a Kim Kardashian of her day, apparently famous for no reason. She's an unsure woman, stemming from her parents' uncertainties, with a wry sense of humour. Macaulay (James Stewart) is one bitter writer, appearing angry until he turns into the kind Jimmy Stewart we love- and gets some great lines. Best Actor worthy though? Nah. Lastly Carey Grant plays the ex, put in a funny position. He's likable and well- handled. The Philadelphia Story has an unfortunate sticker attached to it: it came out in the same year as The Great Dictator. If you check out my review for that, you can see I like it just a little bit, just my favourite comedy of all time. If you asked which of these two films was better, I would choose The Great Dictator every time. While 'Philadelphia' is mostly concerned with telling a story, I found a recurring theme of 'invasion'. The media invades the home's privacy. The ex invades Tracy's privacy. The films shows alcohol influence over the body, and is important to the plot. Lastly, the uncle and the camera women. Maybe this is a coincidence, but it's a good one. Again, the focus of the film is telling a story and making you snicker, where it succeeds. If you like classics or the three major stars attached to this film, you'll like this well made film. 8.0/10

    The Philadelphia Story is about this. When a rich woman's ex-husband and a tabloid-type reporter turn up just before her planned remarriage, she begins to learn the truth about herself. Having watched this only a few weeks ago, I FINALLY am going to give my review on it. In my point of view, The Philadelphia Story is a great movie, it is a great romantic comedy film that is timeless, unforgettable, and a smashing good time! As a matter of fact, this movie is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all time, and not only that, but it is also one of the greatest movies of all time! Why did I want to see this movie in the first place? Because of all of the great things that I have heard about it, as well as the fact that it stars three of the greatest stars of all time, Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart. Every single one of the great things that have been said about this movie are true, it certainly is one of the best movies of all time! The great acting, the great directing, and the humor is proof of that, when you watch this movie, you'll see what I mean. Here's a few things that I have to say about the acting. In his only Oscar Winning performance, Jimmy Stewart (one of my all time favorite actors) shines. He plays a reporter who is getting some information about the wedding of Katharine Hepburn's character. Stewart was outstanding, he totally deserved the Oscar that he won. Cary Grant's performance is also nothing to sneeze at. In fact, Cary Grant could play a wide variety of characters, from comedy roles like this one and Arsenic and Old Lace, to serious roles like Notorious and North By Northwest. And of course Katarine Hepburn deserves mention as well. It is no surprise that the AFI ranked her the greatest female star of all time, because that is a ranking that she totally and completely deserved! So all in all, the great cast are yet another thing that contribute to the greatness of this movie! Not to mention that George Cukor did a great job directing this movie, he directed it in top form! Well anyway, The Philadelphia Story is another movie that I would call a great movie, it is not only one of the best romantic comedy movies ever made, but also one of the best movie movies ever made! This is also another one of those movies that you'll have to see over and over again, as you will love it when you see it for the first time! I am awarding this movie a rating of ten stars out of ten for being a perfect romantic comedy movie that did not disappoint me at all! Considering all of the great things that have been said about this movie, that means that you've got to see it! When you watch this, be prepared to see Katharine Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart, and Cary Grant at the top of their game! The Philadelphia Story is a masterpiece, one of the greatest movies ever made, directed by one of the greatest directors of all time, and starring three of the greatest actors of all time. 10/10

    This is the film that put Hepburn's career back on the map after being labeled "box office poison". It really is a nice film, with strong performances throughout, especially Hepburn as the aristocratic but uptight Tracy Lord. And she has seldom looked more beautiful than she does here; dressed to the nines in elegant dresses by Adrian and her famous red hair coiffed by Sydney Guilaroff. I did think that Ruth Hussey's character has too many smart-alecky lines; it makes her come across as if she is trying too hard. And I also take issue with the premise that Tracy Lord's father blames his daughter's attitude and disrespect toward him as reason for his infidelities to his wife  even when I saw this as a child, I didn't understand why an independent- minded (if a little uptight and controlling) woman would have to account for her dad's cheating. Such a load of BS. I know that we are supposed to take delight in these types of Hepburn films, where her high and mighty characters get humbled by those closest to them, and suddenly she becomes a "female". It makes for some good laughs, but it can also be really condescending and more than a bit sexist. I got the same impression in Woman of the Year as well. And finally, I still shake my head in disbelief that Jimmy Stewart was awarded a Best Actor Oscar for what essentially is a supporting role, and not really of Oscar caliber. I'll always believe that the Best Actor statue should have gone to Henry Fonda. Flaws aside, The Philadelphia Story has some great moments

    rare gem. for script and cast. for nuances and joy. for spirit and smart solutions. for music and performance. for subtle references and for each scene. it is difficult to say something about it because it represents total show. a show who seduce and amuse and define reality with few drops of wise and humor, pink romance and cold precise. and the great virtue is the science to show and use the gift, the art and the delicate manner to create force, soul and shadow of character by Hepburn, Grant and Steward. it can be a surprise. or a delight. it is not important the final verdict because it is only a state of sensibility. a movie. testimony of another time and flavor of admirable work.

    "Philadelphia Story" is a film staring three of my favorite actors of all times. Katherine Hepburn is a Philadelphia socialite who had recently recovered form a very traumatic divorce. She was married with Cary Grant, but their relationship had come to an end since she could not cope with his drinking problems and unwillingness to embrace perfection. Mrs. Hepburn's character is a member of the local high society, who sets high standards of behavior for herself and others around her. Therefore she would not tolerate even the slightest scandals within her close circle  a position that typically pushes someone into judging other people for each and every sin. Two years after she claims to have successfully overcome her previous marriage, Mrs. Hepburn announces she is going to re-marry an aspiring member of the jet set, in order to washout the stains from the past and restore balance and harmony to her life. That is when her ex-husband closes a deal with an important tabloid that is keen to have exclusive pictures of the wedding, pry into her personal life and luckily fill out headlines with intimate scandals. The scheme is to be carried out by a reporter and a photographer (James Stewart and Ruth Hussey), pretending to be close friends of the bride's absent brother. The plot is soon unveiled to the bride, but the others are not aware of what is taking place. The bride then starts to play a game of cat-and-mouse with the reporter. They eventually get terribly drunk and the truth literally comes out. It is a wonderful film, highly entertaining and incredibly avant garde. It deals with themes rarely seen in films of the time, such as female emancipation  divorce and re-marriage. It also exposes the industry of gossip, something that has grown to unfathomed levels since the film was released. The acting is also flawless. One of the highlights is the sequence where James Stewart's character, stinking of booze, is talking nonsense. It even deserved a compliment from Mr. Grant in 1985, when Mr. Stewart was awarded with an honorary Oscar. He stated that Mr. Stewart was asked to the scene a couple of times and it always came out impeccable. The man has truly mastered the art. The screenplay is about a journey into self-knowledge. Of course the underlying message is that only love makes us lower our guard and truly discover who we are. It is interesting to notice that this adage is still deemed the main thrust behind romantic comedies. That is not to say that there is just one way of transmitting this idea to the audience. On the contrary, rom-com is a never-extinguishing source for screen-writing and entertainment precisely because there are various forms of telling basically the same story. However, "Philadelphia Story" stands like a beacon over other rom-coms, providing an excellent example of how the genre can be thoughtful about human relations and simultaneously deliver excellent one-liners.

    The Philadelphia Story is a 1940 Comedy film directed by George Cukor and starring Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart. It is often seen in best-movies-ever lists, and is regarded even more frequently as one of the very best and most significant comedies of the 1940's. It is produced by Hollywood legend Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and is based on the play of the same name released a year prior to the film and shown on Broadway. Tracy (Katharine Hepburn) is an upper class woman who is about to remarry to a wealthy man of the people, George Kittredge. She already has another marriage behind her back, with another upper class-man (Cary Grant), but it ended up with a divorce because of his drinking problem. With the intent to sabotage the event, the ex-husband calls a journalist (James Stewart) to report on the wedding. The night before the wedding will drastically change the position of the to-be-wife because of this journalist. This movie is remembered as a classic for mainly one reason: the brilliant, witty and funny script. It unleashes some of the best dialogue of those years, and several quotes can be taken out of it because of how memorable they are. The actors don't do a bad job in delivering them either: the three main actor's exuberance and vivacity enlighten the atmosphere even more, with the help of other minor character such as the little girl or Tracy's father. It is a perfect example of a Romantic Comedy from the forties, of its sense of humor and its theatrical construct. It is in this last point though where the movie falls a bit; the first half of the film is overly theatrical and at the same time uneventful, with nothing really sticking up to be fun to watch. It is the second half of the movie that really saves it from narrative stagnation, and the viewer's eyes and ears are helplessly glued to what happens on the screen. The ending, like many movies of the time, ends in the absurd and unpredictable. Despite being an overall good movie, especially thanks to the second half, it doesn't have much of an artistic value compared to other comedies of the time. It has an amazing script and good, fun acting, but for a film to be great, there needs to be so much more than that.

    George Cukor directs "The Philadelphia Story". Now regarded as a classic, the films stars Katherine Hepburn as a wealthy socialite who clashes with tabloid reporters, ex lovers and her soon-to-be husband. The film was marketed as a satire, but isn't really. Despite Cukor's attempts at an anti-classist message, the film class condescends and paints Hepburn's working-class fianc&eacute;  a self-made man - as a bit of a buffoon. Still, this is a witty and sparkling film. Based on a Broadway play by Philip Barry, "The Philadelphia Story" overflows with one-liners and snappy dialogue. Characters trade barbs and ripostes like cannon volleys and Cukor's dapper cast do nothing but dazzle and sparkle and crackle with electricity. Iconic actors of the era are sprinkled about  Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant etc  but its Katharine Hepburn's performance that's typically the most celebrated (the NY Film Critics Circle gave her a best actress award for her role). Hepburn was a bit of an oddity in real life. A tomboy, the child of activist parents, very intelligent and rumoured to be gay or bisexual, the roles she played typically mirrored her own life. They're well educated characters, aloof, intelligent, confident, modern, sophisticated, share her preference for trousers over skirts (radical at the time), and of course are always distrustful of men. Able to cut men down to size with their brains, shrill voice and razor-sharp wit, Hepburn's characters quickly led to her becoming a feminist icon (and much later, a gay and lesbian icon). Her characters didn't need men, didn't even seem to need sex (indeed they were often sexually frigid) and were almost always fully independent and autonomous. That is, of course, until the final acts of her films. Almost all her characters are eventually beaten down, tamed and subjugated by lowbrow, carnal, earthly men. The most overt examples are perhaps "The African Queen" and "The Rainmaker", but we see this in "The Philadelphia Story" as well, in which Hepburn reigns for three acts before being domesticated and restored to a safe position. Incidentally, Cukor was himself homosexual. He'd work with Hepburn on a number of pictures, as well as Spencer Tracy and Cary Grant, all of whom faced allegations of homosexuality and/or bisexuality. Cukor's work, like that of Douglas Sirk (also rumoured to be gay), was frequently disparaged in the past. He was deemed a director of "mere women's pictures". Today both have been rehabilitated by film historians, who celebrate the duo for capturing various social undercurrents, psychological or gender complexities. Indeed, most of Cukor's films feature female protagonists, have a feminine sensibility and are told from a woman's point-of-view. Even when he'd drift into traditionally masculine genres, like his western, "Heller in Pink Tights", the style employed would be bizarrely vibrant, almost camp, with lavish colours, opulent sets and women in chief roles. And of course Cukor was responsible for one of the earliest gender bending films. Released in 1936, "Sylvia Scarlett" starred Hepburn again as a rule breaker who masquerades as a boy and attracts sexual attention from both women and men. Filled with sexual misunderstandings and "coming outs", the film, like Cukor's best films, had a hint of autobiography. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    George Cukor's "The Philadelphia Story" was released in 1940 and starred the ultimate Hollywood trinity: Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant. Being a romantic comedy, we suspect she will end up with one of these two. And since she's about to marry a boring guy named George, we quickly understand that she will not marry him, and that the whole story will consist on leading us to that conclusion in two hours, two endlessly and unstoppably long hours. I hate to use the word 'overrated' and 'overacted' so I guess the wrong mindset would be an inevitable obstacle between this movie and me. Being the average schmuck I am, I couldn't relate to Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord, a young and wealthy socialite praised, adored, worshiped by the other schmucks of her community. For my biggest displeasure, I couldn't even relate to James Stewart because as much as I loved his roles in Capra films, I didn't find any invitation for empathy in his character as Macaulay Connor, the wannabe writer and tabloid journalist for a magazine fittingly named 'Spy". I could care about Cary Grant as C.K. (as in 'CocKy) Dexter Morgan, the ex-husband, if only for the hilarious way he palms Tracy's face and pushes her down to the floor. But isn't it a bad omen when the film's most memorable instant happens within the first minute. But despite the brilliance of the gesture and the male charisma he naturally exuded, in that particular film, he seemed rather lifeless to me, bored by the whole gossipy environment (I can't blame him) and only there to recite his lines, to create a false impression of chemistry with Tracy. I couldn't stand his constant grin, but not as much as Hepburn's trademark 'Bryn Mawr" accent (thanks IMDb) that got quickly on my nerves, this 'yawr', 'dahling' or this expression as if she wanted us to check if she had salad stuck in her teeth. But don't take my iconoclasm very seriously, I'm an unexceptional reviewer. In fact, I'm so mediocre, compared to these icons I dare to criticize that I even rooted for John Howard's character as George Kettridge, the target of a whole conspiracy from the director, the writer and the actors. They spared no efforts to mock and belittle George, he was a hypocrite, an ambitious man, but I have to see it to believe it, after all, neither Grant or Connor had better intentions and George seemed a rather decent man. Anyway, they were all so mean-spirited than my immediate reaction was to take his side. At least, in usual screwball comedies, it's one rival against another; here the guy has no chance standing against the two men and his own fianc&eacute; plotting against him. And watching the beautiful Tracy Lord swinging back and forth from Connor to Morgan like a tennis ball was embarrassing, not to mention the ludicrous ending. "Marry me, Tracy", she's reluctant because it wouldn't please his girlfriend photographer Liz (Ruth Hussey). Naturally, Liz doesn't mind being used as a Plan B, nor does Tracy to get back to her precedent husband. Damn, I'm almost glad Georgie got himself out of this mess. The film had its moments though, I liked the part where Stewart pretended to be drunk and you could see at one moment that both him and Grant were trying not to laugh, that was my favorite moment of the film: it was genuine, charming and innocent and it allowed us to forget about the intricacy of the plot. Speaking of that 'drunk' scene, I'm not sure either that Stewart deserved the Oscar, I know it was a compensation for his loss in 1939, but seriously was he better than Henry Fonda in "Grapes of Wrath", or even as a comedic performance, was he better than Charlie Chaplin in "The Great Dictator"? I could concede anything to the movie, maybe if I watched it a third or fourth time, I will end up believing it's a masterpiece, but I don't think I would praise Stewart's performance, I didn't even think it was worthy of a nomination. The writing also won an Oscar, but then again, it's adapted from a play, it has the kind of prefabricated wit that was overexploited in screwball classics, but for some reason, I don't think these kinds of artificial exchange fit the silver screen. Maybe it's the whole vaudeville thing, but I grew rapidly tired of these dialogs where you get the feeling that each character is trying to outsmart the other, and naturally, George is the biggest target, he receives them and seems incapable to say one word or two to Grant or Stewart. From funny, it gets incredibly redundant and ruins the poignancy or the intelligent lucidity some scenes genuinely provides. Granted it's not meant to be realistic, and people have to be entertained, but at one point, it's just words, words, words, or like would say Hepburn "wohds, wohds, wohds". And I guess I've seen enough classics not to feel guilty about this one. And please, don't get me started on the so-called feminist undertones just because Hepburn plays a very strong and outspoken character. If one thing, the film proves (and quite realistically) that a woman can be as strong, as bossy, as a bully as a man IF she's rich. It attacks the core of feminism, which is the perpetual antagonism between men and women by showing that it's only a matter of rich vs. poor. It's funny how the film works better as a social commentary, and it's only by realizing that she wouldn't live with a man who'd prevent her from freedom by letting her drink and loosen up, that Tracy goes with the rich guy, of course, only rich can afford to be decadent. "There goes George", sings Grant to ridicule him, just ignore them, George, you're the unsung hero of "The Philadelphia Story"

    "The Philadelphia Story" is a classic, romantic comedy that features a dash of wit and a strong cast of actors. The concept of three men vying for a women's attention has been a bit overplayed in recent years (think "This Means War," "Twilight," "10 Things I Hate about You") but "The Philadelphia Story" did it right first. Tracy Lord, played by actress Katherine Hepburn, set the bar high as she plays the role with elegance, smarts and humor. Tracy is a fiercely independent woman with her own opinion and Hepburn embodies her from the length of her perfect posture to the confident stride of her walk. The other stand-out character whose charm radiates from the screen via his overprotective persona (even though he violently pushes Hepburn to the ground in the very first scene) is Cary Grant, who plays Tracy's ex-husband. Later on in the film, Grant follows up with more violence as he punches a suitor of Tracy to prove a point to her fianc&eacute;e. When he can't find the words to handle a situation, Grant turns to violence. Growing up, I was taught that violence never solves problems, but apparently Grant had a more interesting home life as a kid. Wealth, class, and exploitation are common motifs that circulate the plot. In a pivotal scene, that shows of Tracy's swift, logical thinking skills, the family learns that the journalists are from Spy Magazine, a tabloid. Due to the family's wealth, the tabloid violates the family's privacy just as the ex violates Tracy's privacy by trying to manipulate he. The celebrity concepts of tabloids and live-in journalists reminded me of the reality shows popular in today's culture. Just as most reality shows progress, the family attempted to be on their best behavior at first, but eventually their true personalities came out. I didn't realize that the concepts of tabloids and paparazzi were prevalent in society this early on. Alcohol is also a reoccurring problem. Alcohol was the reason behind Tracy and her ex-husbands divorce and later on serves as a factor that pushes her new relationship off the edge. At least with my exposure to film, Tracy's alcohol usage is a symptom of a good-girl-gone-bad trend, like in "Mean Girls". In most young adult rebellion films, alcohol contributes to the downfall of innocence. Therefore, in "The Philadelphia Story," alcohol is behind Tracy's mistakes and enlightenment. While I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and the clothing styles of the film, I was a bit put off by the Sexism. I know that women were not treated equally to men in this time era but Tracy was put down by her own father when she shared her opinions and regarded as a Goddess by her male suitors. I don't think she had any radical ideas so I am not sure what all the fuss was about.I also don't understand why it was Tracy's responsibility to make up a story just so her dad wouldn't get in trouble. I guess the wealthy went to great lengths to protect their public perceptions back in the day too. A great portion of this film was dedicated to watching Tracy grow into her own person. I almost find that I am internalizing a backwards message because messages in today's society are tend to relate to women finding their own way through independence and Tracy goes from being independent and outspoken to being almost pressured to marry her ex at the last minute. Nonetheless, Tracy has been plucked from the wilderness and planted in a pot. Through the usage of alcohol and an invasion of privacy, Tracy is no longer the free-spirited, wild blossom she was at the start of the film. She now knows the dangers of outside forces and has decided to settle down with a husband instead of facing the world on her own.

    Firstly, I watched this as a Korean import DVD, which is quite a bit cheaper but possibly, of inferior quality. There's only one disc, for starters and once subtitles have been switched off, plays like any other, though reviewers have mentioned the excellent transfer of the version advertised. This one is very good, thankfully without the dreaded juddery panning shots that I so often suffer with Korean ones, but it's not as crisp as I know other films of this period can be. Philadelphia Story is undoubtedly an evergreen classic. The getting drunk scenes with Katherine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart and the romantic "results" are sent from heaven, the chemistry, Jimmy's famous drawl, the shimmering lighting - beautiful and touching. Magic. This film can be seen countless times; its mixture of satire, romance, comedy and sheer story have probably never been bettered on screen. That it features three of the biggest acting stars on the planet at the time, who actually DO get on with each other, no off-set personality clashes (that I'm aware of) that might spill over into the scenes, creates a real sense of ease and naturalness. Philly Story is essential viewing to all true lovers of film - even if it's not your usual fare, it's an example of how to make a film. For fans of either Grant, Hepburn or Stewart, you've been missing a great deal and seeing them together WILL change your life, well, at least your enjoyment of it!

    IMDb Top 250: 248 The Philadelphia Story is a nice film, a classic comedy with lots of good jokes and heavy star power. Not much commitment is needed to enjoy it, and it can make for a fun afternoon. It's a light rom-com with a few serious scenes. It falls squarely into the category of "see if it it's there, but not worth going out of your way to see". The scene is set with a 'reporter' team going to cover a socialite's wedding with the bride-to-be's ex as a guide: humour, romance and "innundo" ensure. The pace is relaxed throughout, with a slump around the 45 minute mark, but it is made up for by a strong last 45, and an ending that tosses a few twists right until the very end. 'Philadelphia' is worth your time because of its characters and their excellent dialogue. Tracy Lord (Katherine Hepburn) is a socialite, a Kim Kardashian of her day, apparently famous for no reason. She's an unsure woman, stemming from her parents' uncertainties, with a wry sense of humour. Macaulay (James Stewart) is one bitter writer, appearing angry until he turns into the kind Jimmy Stewart we love- and gets some great lines. Best Actor worthy though? Nah. Lastly Carey Grant plays the ex, put in a funny position. He's likable and well- handled. The Philadelphia Story has an unfortunate sticker attached to it: it came out in the same year as The Great Dictator. If you check out my review for that, you can see I like it just a little bit, just my favourite comedy of all time. If you asked which of these two films was better, I would choose The Great Dictator every time. While 'Philadelphia' is mostly concerned with telling a story, I found a recurring theme of 'invasion'. The media invades the home's privacy. The ex invades Tracy's privacy. The films shows alcohol influence over the body, and is important to the plot. Lastly, the uncle and the camera women. Maybe this is a coincidence, but it's a good one. Again, the focus of the film is telling a story and making you snicker, where it succeeds. If you like classics or the three major stars attached to this film, you'll like this well made film. 8.0/10

    The Philadelphia Story is about this. When a rich woman's ex-husband and a tabloid-type reporter turn up just before her planned remarriage, she begins to learn the truth about herself. Having watched this only a few weeks ago, I FINALLY am going to give my review on it. In my point of view, The Philadelphia Story is a great movie, it is a great romantic comedy film that is timeless, unforgettable, and a smashing good time! As a matter of fact, this movie is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all time, and not only that, but it is also one of the greatest movies of all time! Why did I want to see this movie in the first place? Because of all of the great things that I have heard about it, as well as the fact that it stars three of the greatest stars of all time, Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart. Every single one of the great things that have been said about this movie are true, it certainly is one of the best movies of all time! The great acting, the great directing, and the humor is proof of that, when you watch this movie, you'll see what I mean. Here's a few things that I have to say about the acting. In his only Oscar Winning performance, Jimmy Stewart (one of my all time favorite actors) shines. He plays a reporter who is getting some information about the wedding of Katharine Hepburn's character. Stewart was outstanding, he totally deserved the Oscar that he won. Cary Grant's performance is also nothing to sneeze at. In fact, Cary Grant could play a wide variety of characters, from comedy roles like this one and Arsenic and Old Lace, to serious roles like Notorious and North By Northwest. And of course Katarine Hepburn deserves mention as well. It is no surprise that the AFI ranked her the greatest female star of all time, because that is a ranking that she totally and completely deserved! So all in all, the great cast are yet another thing that contribute to the greatness of this movie! Not to mention that George Cukor did a great job directing this movie, he directed it in top form! Well anyway, The Philadelphia Story is another movie that I would call a great movie, it is not only one of the best romantic comedy movies ever made, but also one of the best movie movies ever made! This is also another one of those movies that you'll have to see over and over again, as you will love it when you see it for the first time! I am awarding this movie a rating of ten stars out of ten for being a perfect romantic comedy movie that did not disappoint me at all! Considering all of the great things that have been said about this movie, that means that you've got to see it! When you watch this, be prepared to see Katharine Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart, and Cary Grant at the top of their game! The Philadelphia Story is a masterpiece, one of the greatest movies ever made, directed by one of the greatest directors of all time, and starring three of the greatest actors of all time. 10/10

    This is the film that put Hepburn's career back on the map after being labeled "box office poison". It really is a nice film, with strong performances throughout, especially Hepburn as the aristocratic but uptight Tracy Lord. And she has seldom looked more beautiful than she does here; dressed to the nines in elegant dresses by Adrian and her famous red hair coiffed by Sydney Guilaroff. I did think that Ruth Hussey's character has too many smart-alecky lines; it makes her come across as if she is trying too hard. And I also take issue with the premise that Tracy Lord's father blames his daughter's attitude and disrespect toward him as reason for his infidelities to his wife  even when I saw this as a child, I didn't understand why an independent- minded (if a little uptight and controlling) woman would have to account for her dad's cheating. Such a load of BS. I know that we are supposed to take delight in these types of Hepburn films, where her high and mighty characters get humbled by those closest to them, and suddenly she becomes a "female". It makes for some good laughs, but it can also be really condescending and more than a bit sexist. I got the same impression in Woman of the Year as well. And finally, I still shake my head in disbelief that Jimmy Stewart was awarded a Best Actor Oscar for what essentially is a supporting role, and not really of Oscar caliber. I'll always believe that the Best Actor statue should have gone to Henry Fonda. Flaws aside, The Philadelphia Story has some great moments

    rare gem. for script and cast. for nuances and joy. for spirit and smart solutions. for music and performance. for subtle references and for each scene. it is difficult to say something about it because it represents total show. a show who seduce and amuse and define reality with few drops of wise and humor, pink romance and cold precise. and the great virtue is the science to show and use the gift, the art and the delicate manner to create force, soul and shadow of character by Hepburn, Grant and Steward. it can be a surprise. or a delight. it is not important the final verdict because it is only a state of sensibility. a movie. testimony of another time and flavor of admirable work.

    "Philadelphia Story" is a film staring three of my favorite actors of all times. Katherine Hepburn is a Philadelphia socialite who had recently recovered form a very traumatic divorce. She was married with Cary Grant, but their relationship had come to an end since she could not cope with his drinking problems and unwillingness to embrace perfection. Mrs. Hepburn's character is a member of the local high society, who sets high standards of behavior for herself and others around her. Therefore she would not tolerate even the slightest scandals within her close circle  a position that typically pushes someone into judging other people for each and every sin. Two years after she claims to have successfully overcome her previous marriage, Mrs. Hepburn announces she is going to re-marry an aspiring member of the jet set, in order to washout the stains from the past and restore balance and harmony to her life. That is when her ex-husband closes a deal with an important tabloid that is keen to have exclusive pictures of the wedding, pry into her personal life and luckily fill out headlines with intimate scandals. The scheme is to be carried out by a reporter and a photographer (James Stewart and Ruth Hussey), pretending to be close friends of the bride's absent brother. The plot is soon unveiled to the bride, but the others are not aware of what is taking place. The bride then starts to play a game of cat-and-mouse with the reporter. They eventually get terribly drunk and the truth literally comes out. It is a wonderful film, highly entertaining and incredibly avant garde. It deals with themes rarely seen in films of the time, such as female emancipation  divorce and re-marriage. It also exposes the industry of gossip, something that has grown to unfathomed levels since the film was released. The acting is also flawless. One of the highlights is the sequence where James Stewart's character, stinking of booze, is talking nonsense. It even deserved a compliment from Mr. Grant in 1985, when Mr. Stewart was awarded with an honorary Oscar. He stated that Mr. Stewart was asked to the scene a couple of times and it always came out impeccable. The man has truly mastered the art. The screenplay is about a journey into self-knowledge. Of course the underlying message is that only love makes us lower our guard and truly discover who we are. It is interesting to notice that this adage is still deemed the main thrust behind romantic comedies. That is not to say that there is just one way of transmitting this idea to the audience. On the contrary, rom-com is a never-extinguishing source for screen-writing and entertainment precisely because there are various forms of telling basically the same story. However, "Philadelphia Story" stands like a beacon over other rom-coms, providing an excellent example of how the genre can be thoughtful about human relations and simultaneously deliver excellent one-liners.

    The Philadelphia Story is a 1940 Comedy film directed by George Cukor and starring Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart. It is often seen in best-movies-ever lists, and is regarded even more frequently as one of the very best and most significant comedies of the 1940's. It is produced by Hollywood legend Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and is based on the play of the same name released a year prior to the film and shown on Broadway. Tracy (Katharine Hepburn) is an upper class woman who is about to remarry to a wealthy man of the people, George Kittredge. She already has another marriage behind her back, with another upper class-man (Cary Grant), but it ended up with a divorce because of his drinking problem. With the intent to sabotage the event, the ex-husband calls a journalist (James Stewart) to report on the wedding. The night before the wedding will drastically change the position of the to-be-wife because of this journalist. This movie is remembered as a classic for mainly one reason: the brilliant, witty and funny script. It unleashes some of the best dialogue of those years, and several quotes can be taken out of it because of how memorable they are. The actors don't do a bad job in delivering them either: the three main actor's exuberance and vivacity enlighten the atmosphere even more, with the help of other minor character such as the little girl or Tracy's father. It is a perfect example of a Romantic Comedy from the forties, of its sense of humor and its theatrical construct. It is in this last point though where the movie falls a bit; the first half of the film is overly theatrical and at the same time uneventful, with nothing really sticking up to be fun to watch. It is the second half of the movie that really saves it from narrative stagnation, and the viewer's eyes and ears are helplessly glued to what happens on the screen. The ending, like many movies of the time, ends in the absurd and unpredictable. Despite being an overall good movie, especially thanks to the second half, it doesn't have much of an artistic value compared to other comedies of the time. It has an amazing script and good, fun acting, but for a film to be great, there needs to be so much more than that.

    George Cukor directs "The Philadelphia Story". Now regarded as a classic, the films stars Katherine Hepburn as a wealthy socialite who clashes with tabloid reporters, ex lovers and her soon-to-be husband. The film was marketed as a satire, but isn't really. Despite Cukor's attempts at an anti-classist message, the film class condescends and paints Hepburn's working-class fianc&eacute;  a self-made man - as a bit of a buffoon. Still, this is a witty and sparkling film. Based on a Broadway play by Philip Barry, "The Philadelphia Story" overflows with one-liners and snappy dialogue. Characters trade barbs and ripostes like cannon volleys and Cukor's dapper cast do nothing but dazzle and sparkle and crackle with electricity. Iconic actors of the era are sprinkled about  Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant etc  but its Katharine Hepburn's performance that's typically the most celebrated (the NY Film Critics Circle gave her a best actress award for her role). Hepburn was a bit of an oddity in real life. A tomboy, the child of activist parents, very intelligent and rumoured to be gay or bisexual, the roles she played typically mirrored her own life. They're well educated characters, aloof, intelligent, confident, modern, sophisticated, share her preference for trousers over skirts (radical at the time), and of course are always distrustful of men. Able to cut men down to size with their brains, shrill voice and razor-sharp wit, Hepburn's characters quickly led to her becoming a feminist icon (and much later, a gay and lesbian icon). Her characters didn't need men, didn't even seem to need sex (indeed they were often sexually frigid) and were almost always fully independent and autonomous. That is, of course, until the final acts of her films. Almost all her characters are eventually beaten down, tamed and subjugated by lowbrow, carnal, earthly men. The most overt examples are perhaps "The African Queen" and "The Rainmaker", but we see this in "The Philadelphia Story" as well, in which Hepburn reigns for three acts before being domesticated and restored to a safe position. Incidentally, Cukor was himself homosexual. He'd work with Hepburn on a number of pictures, as well as Spencer Tracy and Cary Grant, all of whom faced allegations of homosexuality and/or bisexuality. Cukor's work, like that of Douglas Sirk (also rumoured to be gay), was frequently disparaged in the past. He was deemed a director of "mere women's pictures". Today both have been rehabilitated by film historians, who celebrate the duo for capturing various social undercurrents, psychological or gender complexities. Indeed, most of Cukor's films feature female protagonists, have a feminine sensibility and are told from a woman's point-of-view. Even when he'd drift into traditionally masculine genres, like his western, "Heller in Pink Tights", the style employed would be bizarrely vibrant, almost camp, with lavish colours, opulent sets and women in chief roles. And of course Cukor was responsible for one of the earliest gender bending films. Released in 1936, "Sylvia Scarlett" starred Hepburn again as a rule breaker who masquerades as a boy and attracts sexual attention from both women and men. Filled with sexual misunderstandings and "coming outs", the film, like Cukor's best films, had a hint of autobiography. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    George Cukor's "The Philadelphia Story" was released in 1940 and starred the ultimate Hollywood trinity: Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant. Being a romantic comedy, we suspect she will end up with one of these two. And since she's about to marry a boring guy named George, we quickly understand that she will not marry him, and that the whole story will consist on leading us to that conclusion in two hours, two endlessly and unstoppably long hours. I hate to use the word 'overrated' and 'overacted' so I guess the wrong mindset would be an inevitable obstacle between this movie and me. Being the average schmuck I am, I couldn't relate to Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord, a young and wealthy socialite praised, adored, worshiped by the other schmucks of her community. For my biggest displeasure, I couldn't even relate to James Stewart because as much as I loved his roles in Capra films, I didn't find any invitation for empathy in his character as Macaulay Connor, the wannabe writer and tabloid journalist for a magazine fittingly named 'Spy". I could care about Cary Grant as C.K. (as in 'CocKy) Dexter Morgan, the ex-husband, if only for the hilarious way he palms Tracy's face and pushes her down to the floor. But isn't it a bad omen when the film's most memorable instant happens within the first minute. But despite the brilliance of the gesture and the male charisma he naturally exuded, in that particular film, he seemed rather lifeless to me, bored by the whole gossipy environment (I can't blame him) and only there to recite his lines, to create a false impression of chemistry with Tracy. I couldn't stand his constant grin, but not as much as Hepburn's trademark 'Bryn Mawr" accent (thanks IMDb) that got quickly on my nerves, this 'yawr', 'dahling' or this expression as if she wanted us to check if she had salad stuck in her teeth. But don't take my iconoclasm very seriously, I'm an unexceptional reviewer. In fact, I'm so mediocre, compared to these icons I dare to criticize that I even rooted for John Howard's character as George Kettridge, the target of a whole conspiracy from the director, the writer and the actors. They spared no efforts to mock and belittle George, he was a hypocrite, an ambitious man, but I have to see it to believe it, after all, neither Grant or Connor had better intentions and George seemed a rather decent man. Anyway, they were all so mean-spirited than my immediate reaction was to take his side. At least, in usual screwball comedies, it's one rival against another; here the guy has no chance standing against the two men and his own fianc&eacute; plotting against him. And watching the beautiful Tracy Lord swinging back and forth from Connor to Morgan like a tennis ball was embarrassing, not to mention the ludicrous ending. "Marry me, Tracy", she's reluctant because it wouldn't please his girlfriend photographer Liz (Ruth Hussey). Naturally, Liz doesn't mind being used as a Plan B, nor does Tracy to get back to her precedent husband. Damn, I'm almost glad Georgie got himself out of this mess. The film had its moments though, I liked the part where Stewart pretended to be drunk and you could see at one moment that both him and Grant were trying not to laugh, that was my favorite moment of the film: it was genuine, charming and innocent and it allowed us to forget about the intricacy of the plot. Speaking of that 'drunk' scene, I'm not sure either that Stewart deserved the Oscar, I know it was a compensation for his loss in 1939, but seriously was he better than Henry Fonda in "Grapes of Wrath", or even as a comedic performance, was he better than Charlie Chaplin in "The Great Dictator"? I could concede anything to the movie, maybe if I watched it a third or fourth time, I will end up believing it's a masterpiece, but I don't think I would praise Stewart's performance, I didn't even think it was worthy of a nomination. The writing also won an Oscar, but then again, it's adapted from a play, it has the kind of prefabricated wit that was overexploited in screwball classics, but for some reason, I don't think these kinds of artificial exchange fit the silver screen. Maybe it's the whole vaudeville thing, but I grew rapidly tired of these dialogs where you get the feeling that each character is trying to outsmart the other, and naturally, George is the biggest target, he receives them and seems incapable to say one word or two to Grant or Stewart. From funny, it gets incredibly redundant and ruins the poignancy or the intelligent lucidity some scenes genuinely provides. Granted it's not meant to be realistic, and people have to be entertained, but at one point, it's just words, words, words, or like would say Hepburn "wohds, wohds, wohds". And I guess I've seen enough classics not to feel guilty about this one. And please, don't get me started on the so-called feminist undertones just because Hepburn plays a very strong and outspoken character. If one thing, the film proves (and quite realistically) that a woman can be as strong, as bossy, as a bully as a man IF she's rich. It attacks the core of feminism, which is the perpetual antagonism between men and women by showing that it's only a matter of rich vs. poor. It's funny how the film works better as a social commentary, and it's only by realizing that she wouldn't live with a man who'd prevent her from freedom by letting her drink and loosen up, that Tracy goes with the rich guy, of course, only rich can afford to be decadent. "There goes George", sings Grant to ridicule him, just ignore them, George, you're the unsung hero of "The Philadelphia Story"

    "The Philadelphia Story" is a classic, romantic comedy that features a dash of wit and a strong cast of actors. The concept of three men vying for a women's attention has been a bit overplayed in recent years (think "This Means War," "Twilight," "10 Things I Hate about You") but "The Philadelphia Story" did it right first. Tracy Lord, played by actress Katherine Hepburn, set the bar high as she plays the role with elegance, smarts and humor. Tracy is a fiercely independent woman with her own opinion and Hepburn embodies her from the length of her perfect posture to the confident stride of her walk. The other stand-out character whose charm radiates from the screen via his overprotective persona (even though he violently pushes Hepburn to the ground in the very first scene) is Cary Grant, who plays Tracy's ex-husband. Later on in the film, Grant follows up with more violence as he punches a suitor of Tracy to prove a point to her fianc&eacute;e. When he can't find the words to handle a situation, Grant turns to violence. Growing up, I was taught that violence never solves problems, but apparently Grant had a more interesting home life as a kid. Wealth, class, and exploitation are common motifs that circulate the plot. In a pivotal scene, that shows of Tracy's swift, logical thinking skills, the family learns that the journalists are from Spy Magazine, a tabloid.

Nonetheless, Tracy has been plucked from the wilderness and planted in a pot. Through the usage of alcohol and an invasion of privacy, Tracy is no longer the free-spirited, wild blossom she was at the start of the film. She now knows the dangers of outside forces and has decided to settle down with a husband instead of facing the world on her own.

    Firstly, I watched this as a Korean import DVD, which is quite a bit cheaper but possibly, of inferior quality. There's only one disc, for starters and once subtitles have been switched off, plays like any other, though reviewers have mentioned the excellent transfer of the version advertised. This one is very good, thankfully without the dreaded juddery panning shots that I so often suffer with Korean ones, but it's not as crisp as I know other films of this period can be. Philadelphia Story is undoubtedly an evergreen classic. The getting drunk scenes with Katherine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart and the romantic "results" are sent from heaven, the chemistry, Jimmy's famous drawl, the shimmering lighting - beautiful and touching. Magic. This film can be seen countless times; its mixture of satire, romance, comedy and sheer story have probably never been bettered on screen. That it features three of the biggest acting stars on the planet at the time, who actually DO get on with each other, no off-set personality clashes (that I'm aware of) that might spill over into the scenes, creates a real sense of ease and naturalness. Philly Story is essential viewing to all true lovers of film - even if it's not your usual fare, it's an example of how to make a film. For fans of either Grant, Hepburn or Stewart, you've been missing a great deal and seeing them together WILL change your life, well, at least your enjoyment of it!

    IMDb Top 250: 248 The Philadelphia Story is a nice film, a classic comedy with lots of good jokes and heavy star power. Not much commitment is needed to enjoy it, and it can make for a fun afternoon. It's a light rom-com with a few serious scenes. It falls squarely into the category of "see if it it's there, but not worth going out of your way to see". The scene is set with a 'reporter' team going to cover a socialite's wedding with the bride-to-be's ex as a guide: humour, romance and "innundo" ensure. The pace is relaxed throughout, with a slump around the 45 minute mark, but it is made up for by a strong last 45, and an ending that tosses a few twists right until the very end. 'Philadelphia' is worth your time because of its characters and their excellent dialogue. Tracy Lord (Katherine Hepburn) is a socialite, a Kim Kardashian of her day, apparently famous for no reason. She's an unsure woman, stemming from her parents' uncertainties, with a wry sense of humour. Macaulay (James Stewart) is one bitter writer, appearing angry until he turns into the kind Jimmy Stewart we love- and gets some great lines. Best Actor worthy though? Nah. Lastly Carey Grant plays the ex, put in a funny position. He's likable and well- handled. The Philadelphia Story has an unfortunate sticker attached to it: it came out in the same year as The Great Dictator. If you check out my review for that, you can see I like it just a little bit, just my favourite comedy of all time. If you asked which of these two films was better, I would choose The Great Dictator every time. While 'Philadelphia' is mostly concerned with telling a story, I found a recurring theme of 'invasion'. The media invades the home's privacy. The ex invades Tracy's privacy. The films shows alcohol influence over the body, and is important to the plot. Lastly, the uncle and the camera women. Maybe this is a coincidence, but it's a good one. Again, the focus of the film is telling a story and making you snicker, where it succeeds. If you like classics or the three major stars attached to this film, you'll like this well made film. 8.0/10

    The Philadelphia Story is about this. When a rich woman's ex-husband and a tabloid-type reporter turn up just before her planned remarriage, she begins to learn the truth about herself. Having watched this only a few weeks ago, I FINALLY am going to give my review on it. In my point of view, The Philadelphia Story is a great movie, it is a great romantic comedy film that is timeless, unforgettable, and a smashing good time! As a matter of fact, this movie is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all time, and not only that, but it is also one of the greatest movies of all time! Why did I want to see this movie in the first place? Because of all of the great things that I have heard about it, as well as the fact that it stars three of the greatest stars of all time, Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart. Every single one of the great things that have been said about this movie are true, it certainly is one of the best movies of all time! The great acting, the great directing, and the humor is proof of that, when you watch this movie, you'll see what I mean. Here's a few things that I have to say about the acting. In his only Oscar Winning performance, Jimmy Stewart (one of my all time favorite actors) shines. He plays a reporter who is getting some information about the wedding of Katharine Hepburn's character. Stewart was outstanding, he totally deserved the Oscar that he won. Cary Grant's performance is also nothing to sneeze at. In fact, Cary Grant could play a wide variety of characters, from comedy roles like this one and Arsenic and Old Lace, to serious roles like Notorious and North By Northwest. And of course Katarine Hepburn deserves mention as well. It is no surprise that the AFI ranked her the greatest female star of all time, because that is a ranking that she totally and completely deserved! So all in all, the great cast are yet another thing that contribute to the greatness of this movie! Not to mention that George Cukor did a great job directing this movie, he directed it in top form! Well anyway, The Philadelphia Story is another movie that I would call a great movie, it is not only one of the best romantic comedy movies ever made, but also one of the best movie movies ever made! This is also another one of those movies that you'll have to see over and over again, as you will love it when you see it for the first time! I am awarding this movie a rating of ten stars out of ten for being a perfect romantic comedy movie that did not disappoint me at all! Considering all of the great things that have been said about this movie, that means that you've got to see it! When you watch this, be prepared to see Katharine Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart, and Cary Grant at the top of their game! The Philadelphia Story is a masterpiece, one of the greatest movies ever made, directed by one of the greatest directors of all time, and starring three of the greatest actors of all time. 10/10

    This is the film that put Hepburn's career back on the map after being labeled "box office poison". It really is a nice film, with strong performances throughout, especially Hepburn as the aristocratic but uptight Tracy Lord. And she has seldom looked more beautiful than she does here; dressed to the nines in elegant dresses by Adrian and her famous red hair coiffed by Sydney Guilaroff. I did think that Ruth Hussey's character has too many smart-alecky lines; it makes her come across as if she is trying too hard. And I also take issue with the premise that Tracy Lord's father blames his daughter's attitude and disrespect toward him as reason for his infidelities to his wife  even when I saw this as a child, I didn't understand why an independent- minded (if a little uptight and controlling) woman would have to account for her dad's cheating. Such a load of BS. I know that we are supposed to take delight in these types of Hepburn films, where her high and mighty characters get humbled by those closest to them, and suddenly she becomes a "female". It makes for some good laughs, but it can also be really condescending and more than a bit sexist. I got the same impression in Woman of the Year as well. And finally, I still shake my head in disbelief that Jimmy Stewart was awarded a Best Actor Oscar for what essentially is a supporting role, and not really of Oscar caliber. I'll always believe that the Best Actor statue should have gone to Henry Fonda. Flaws aside, The Philadelphia Story has some great moments

    rare gem. for script and cast. for nuances and joy. for spirit and smart solutions. for music and performance. for subtle references and for each scene. it is difficult to say something about it because it represents total show. a show who seduce and amuse and define reality with few drops of wise and humor, pink romance and cold precise. and the great virtue is the science to show and use the gift, the art and the delicate manner to create force, soul and shadow of character by Hepburn, Grant and Steward. it can be a surprise. or a delight. it is not important the final verdict because it is only a state of sensibility. a movie. testimony of another time and flavor of admirable work.

    "Philadelphia Story" is a film staring three of my favorite actors of all times. Katherine Hepburn is a Philadelphia socialite who had recently recovered form a very traumatic divorce. She was married with Cary Grant, but their relationship had come to an end since she could not cope with his drinking problems and unwillingness to embrace perfection. Mrs. Hepburn's character is a member of the local high society, who sets high standards of behavior for herself and others around her. Therefore she would not tolerate even the slightest scandals within her close circle  a position that typically pushes someone into judging other people for each and every sin. Two years after she claims to have successfully overcome her previous marriage, Mrs. Hepburn announces she is going to re-marry an aspiring member of the jet set, in order to washout the stains from the past and restore balance and harmony to her life. That is when her ex-husband closes a deal with an important tabloid that is keen to have exclusive pictures of the wedding, pry into her personal life and luckily fill out headlines with intimate scandals. The scheme is to be carried out by a reporter and a photographer (James Stewart and Ruth Hussey), pretending to be close friends of the bride's absent brother. The plot is soon unveiled to the bride, but the others are not aware of what is taking place. The bride then starts to play a game of cat-and-mouse with the reporter. They eventually get terribly drunk and the truth literally comes out. It is a wonderful film, highly entertaining and incredibly avant garde. It deals with themes rarely seen in films of the time, such as female emancipation  divorce and re-marriage. It also exposes the industry of gossip, something that has grown to unfathomed levels since the film was released. The acting is also flawless. One of the highlights is the sequence where James Stewart's character, stinking of booze, is talking nonsense. It even deserved a compliment from Mr. Grant in 1985, when Mr. Stewart was awarded with an honorary Oscar. He stated that Mr. Stewart was asked to the scene a couple of times and it always came out impeccable. The man has truly mastered the art. The screenplay is about a journey into self-knowledge. Of course the underlying message is that only love makes us lower our guard and truly discover who we are. It is interesting to notice that this adage is still deemed the main thrust behind romantic comedies. That is not to say that there is just one way of transmitting this idea to the audience. On the contrary, rom-com is a never-extinguishing source for screen-writing and entertainment precisely because there are various forms of telling basically the same story. However, "Philadelphia Story" stands like a beacon over other rom-coms, providing an excellent example of how the genre can be thoughtful about human relations and simultaneously deliver excellent one-liners.

    The Philadelphia Story is a 1940 Comedy film directed by George Cukor and starring Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart. It is often seen in best-movies-ever lists, and is regarded even more frequently as one of the very best and most significant comedies of the 1940's. It is produced by Hollywood legend Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and is based on the play of the same name released a year prior to the film and shown on Broadway. Tracy (Katharine Hepburn) is an upper class woman who is about to remarry to a wealthy man of the people, George Kittredge. She already has another marriage behind her back, with another upper class-man (Cary Grant), but it ended up with a divorce because of his drinking problem. With the intent to sabotage the event, the ex-husband calls a journalist (James Stewart) to report on the wedding. The night before the wedding will drastically change the position of the to-be-wife because of this journalist. This movie is remembered as a classic for mainly one reason: the brilliant, witty and funny script. It unleashes some of the best dialogue of those years, and several quotes can be taken out of it because of how memorable they are. The actors don't do a bad job in delivering them either: the three main actor's exuberance and vivacity enlighten the atmosphere even more, with the help of other minor character such as the little girl or Tracy's father. It is a perfect example of a Romantic Comedy from the forties, of its sense of humor and its theatrical construct. It is in this last point though where the movie falls a bit; the first half of the film is overly theatrical and at the same time uneventful, with nothing really sticking up to be fun to watch. It is the second half of the movie that really saves it from narrative stagnation, and the viewer's eyes and ears are helplessly glued to what happens on the screen. The ending, like many movies of the time, ends in the absurd and unpredictable. Despite being an overall good movie, especially thanks to the second half, it doesn't have much of an artistic value compared to other comedies of the time. It has an amazing script and good, fun acting, but for a film to be great, there needs to be so much more than that.

    George Cukor directs "The Philadelphia Story". Now regarded as a classic, the films stars Katherine Hepburn as a wealthy socialite who clashes with tabloid reporters, ex lovers and her soon-to-be husband. The film was marketed as a satire, but isn't really. Despite Cukor's attempts at an anti-classist message, the film class condescends and paints Hepburn's working-class fianc&eacute;  a self-made man - as a bit of a buffoon. Still, this is a witty and sparkling film. Based on a Broadway play by Philip Barry, "The Philadelphia Story" overflows with one-liners and snappy dialogue. Characters trade barbs and ripostes like cannon volleys and Cukor's dapper cast do nothing but dazzle and sparkle and crackle with electricity. Iconic actors of the era are sprinkled about  Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant etc  but its Katharine Hepburn's performance that's typically the most celebrated (the NY Film Critics Circle gave her a best actress award for her role). Hepburn was a bit of an oddity in real life. A tomboy, the child of activist parents, very intelligent and rumoured to be gay or bisexual, the roles she played typically mirrored her own life. They're well educated characters, aloof, intelligent, confident, modern, sophisticated, share her preference for trousers over skirts (radical at the time), and of course are always distrustful of men. Able to cut men down to size with their brains, shrill voice and razor-sharp wit, Hepburn's characters quickly led to her becoming a feminist icon (and much later, a gay and lesbian icon). Her characters didn't need men, didn't even seem to need sex (indeed they were often sexually frigid) and were almost always fully independent and autonomous. That is, of course, until the final acts of her films. Almost all her characters are eventually beaten down, tamed and subjugated by lowbrow, carnal, earthly men. The most overt examples are perhaps "The African Queen" and "The Rainmaker", but we see this in "The Philadelphia Story" as well, in which Hepburn reigns for three acts before being domesticated and restored to a safe position. Incidentally, Cukor was himself homosexual. He'd work with Hepburn on a number of pictures, as well as Spencer Tracy and Cary Grant, all of whom faced allegations of homosexuality and/or bisexuality. Cukor's work, like that of Douglas Sirk (also rumoured to be gay), was frequently disparaged in the past. He was deemed a director of "mere women's pictures". Today both have been rehabilitated by film historians, who celebrate the duo for capturing various social undercurrents, psychological or gender complexities. Indeed, most of Cukor's films feature female protagonists, have a feminine sensibility and are told from a woman's point-of-view. Even when he'd drift into traditionally masculine genres, like his western, "Heller in Pink Tights", the style employed would be bizarrely vibrant, almost camp, with lavish colours, opulent sets and women in chief roles. And of course Cukor was responsible for one of the earliest gender bending films. Released in 1936, "Sylvia Scarlett" starred Hepburn again as a rule breaker who masquerades as a boy and attracts sexual attention from both women and men. Filled with sexual misunderstandings and "coming outs", the film, like Cukor's best films, had a hint of autobiography. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    George Cukor's "The Philadelphia Story" was released in 1940 and starred the ultimate Hollywood trinity: Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant. Being a romantic comedy, we suspect she will end up with one of these two. And since she's about to marry a boring guy named George, we quickly understand that she will not marry him, and that the whole story will consist on leading us to that conclusion in two hours, two endlessly and unstoppably long hours. I hate to use the word 'overrated' and 'overacted' so I guess the wrong mindset would be an inevitable obstacle between this movie and me. Being the average schmuck I am, I couldn't relate to Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord, a young and wealthy socialite praised, adored, worshiped by the other schmucks of her community. For my biggest displeasure, I couldn't even relate to James Stewart because as much as I loved his roles in Capra films, I didn't find any invitation for empathy in his character as Macaulay Connor, the wannabe writer and tabloid journalist for a magazine fittingly named 'Spy". I could care about Cary Grant as C.K. (as in 'CocKy) Dexter Morgan, the ex-husband, if only for the hilarious way he palms Tracy's face and pushes her down to the floor. But isn't it a bad omen when the film's most memorable instant happens within the first minute. But despite the brilliance of the gesture and the male charisma he naturally exuded, in that particular film, he seemed rather lifeless to me, bored by the whole gossipy environment (I can't blame him) and only there to recite his lines, to create a false impression of chemistry with Tracy. I couldn't stand his constant grin, but not as much as Hepburn's trademark 'Bryn Mawr" accent (thanks IMDb) that got quickly on my nerves, this 'yawr', 'dahling' or this expression as if she wanted us to check if she had salad stuck in her teeth. But don't take my iconoclasm very seriously, I'm an unexceptional reviewer. In fact, I'm so mediocre, compared to these icons I dare to criticize that I even rooted for John Howard's character as George Kettridge, the target of a whole conspiracy from the director, the writer and the actors. They spared no efforts to mock and belittle George, he was a hypocrite, an ambitious man, but I have to see it to believe it, after all, neither Grant or Connor had better intentions and George seemed a rather decent man. Anyway, they were all so mean-spirited than my immediate reaction was to take his side. At least, in usual screwball comedies, it's one rival against another; here the guy has no chance standing against the two men and his own fianc&eacute; plotting against him. And watching the beautiful Tracy Lord swinging back and forth from Connor to Morgan like a tennis ball was embarrassing, not to mention the ludicrous ending. "Marry me, Tracy", she's reluctant because it wouldn't please his girlfriend photographer Liz (Ruth Hussey). Naturally, Liz doesn't mind being used as a Plan B, nor does Tracy to get back to her precedent husband. Damn, I'm almost glad Georgie got himself out of this mess. The film had its moments though, I liked the part where Stewart pretended to be drunk and you could see at one moment that both him and Grant were trying not to laugh, that was my favorite moment of the film: it was genuine, charming and innocent and it allowed us to forget about the intricacy of the plot. Speaking of that 'drunk' scene, I'm not sure either that Stewart deserved the Oscar, I know it was a compensation for his loss in 1939, but seriously was he better than Henry Fonda in "Grapes of Wrath", or even as a comedic performance, was he better than Charlie Chaplin in "The Great Dictator"? I could concede anything to the movie, maybe if I watched it a third or fourth time, I will end up believing it's a masterpiece, but I don't think I would praise Stewart's performance, I didn't even think it was worthy of a nomination. The writing also won an Oscar, but then again, it's adapted from a play, it has the kind of prefabricated wit that was overexploited in screwball classics, but for some reason, I don't think these kinds of artificial exchange fit the silver screen. Maybe it's the whole vaudeville thing, but I grew rapidly tired of these dialogs where you get the feeling that each character is trying to outsmart the other, and naturally, George is the biggest target, he receives them and seems incapable to say one word or two to Grant or Stewart. From funny, it gets incredibly redundant and ruins the poignancy or the intelligent lucidity some scenes genuinely provides. Granted it's not meant to be realistic, and people have to be entertained, but at one point, it's just words, words, words, or like would say Hepburn "wohds, wohds, wohds". And I guess I've seen enough classics not to feel guilty about this one. And please, don't get me started on the so-called feminist undertones just because Hepburn plays a very strong and outspoken character. If one thing, the film proves (and quite realistically) that a woman can be as strong, as bossy, as a bully as a man IF she's rich. It attacks the core of feminism, which is the perpetual antagonism between men and women by showing that it's only a matter of rich vs. poor. It's funny how the film works better as a social commentary, and it's only by realizing that she wouldn't live with a man who'd prevent her from freedom by letting her drink and loosen up, that Tracy goes with the rich guy, of course, only rich can afford to be decadent. "There goes George", sings Grant to ridicule him, just ignore them, George, you're the unsung hero of "The Philadelphia Story"

    "The Philadelphia Story" is a classic, romantic comedy that features a dash of wit and a strong cast of actors. The concept of three men vying for a women's attention has been a bit overplayed in recent years (think "This Means War," "Twilight," "10 Things I Hate about You") but "The Philadelphia Story" did it right first. Tracy Lord, played by actress Katherine Hepburn, set the bar high as she plays the role with elegance, smarts and humor. Tracy is a fiercely independent woman with her own opinion and Hepburn embodies her from the length of her perfect posture to the confident stride of her walk. The other stand-out character whose charm radiates from the screen via his overprotective persona (even though he violently pushes Hepburn to the ground in the very first scene) is Cary Grant, who plays Tracy's ex-husband. Later on in the film, Grant follows up with more violence as he punches a suitor of Tracy to prove a point to her fianc&eacute;e. When he can't find the words to handle a situation, Grant turns to violence. Growing up, I was taught that violence never solves problems, but apparently Grant had a more interesting home life as a kid. Wealth, class, and exploitation are common motifs that circulate the plot. In a pivotal scene, that shows of Tracy's swift, logical thinking skills, the family learns that the journalists are from Spy Magazine, a tabloid. Due to the family's wealth, the tabloid violates the family's privacy just as the ex violates Tracy's privacy by trying to manipulate he. The celebrity concepts of tabloids and live-in journalists reminded me of the reality shows popular in today's culture. Just as most reality shows progress, the family attempted to be on their best behavior at first, but eventually their true personalities came out. I didn't realize that the concepts of tabloids and paparazzi were prevalent in society this early on. Alcohol is also a reoccurring problem. Alcohol was the reason behind Tracy and her ex-husbands divorce and later on serves as a factor that pushes her new relationship off the edge. At least with my exposure to film, Tracy's alcohol usage is a symptom of a good-girl-gone-bad trend, like in "Mean Girls". In most young adult rebellion films, alcohol contributes to the downfall of innocence. Therefore, in "The Philadelphia Story," alcohol is behind Tracy's mistakes and enlightenment. While I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and the clothing styles of the film, I was a bit put off by the Sexism. I know that women were not treated equally to men in this time era but Tracy was put down by her own father when she shared her opinions and regarded as a Goddess by her male suitors. I don't think she had any radical ideas so I am not sure what all the fuss was about.I also don't understand why it was Tracy's responsibility to make up a story just so her dad wouldn't get in trouble. I guess the wealthy went to great lengths to protect their public perceptions back in the day too. A great portion of this film was dedicated to watching Tracy grow into her own person. I almost find that I am internalizing a backwards message because messages in today's society are tend to relate to women finding their own way through independence and Tracy goes from being independent and outspoken to being almost pressured to marry her ex at the last minute. Nonetheless, Tracy has been plucked from the wilderness and planted in a pot. Through the usage of alcohol and an invasion of privacy, Tracy is no longer the free-spirited, wild blossom she was at the start of the film. She now knows the dangers of outside forces and has decided to settle down with a husband instead of facing the world on her own.

Not much commitment is needed to enjoy it, and it can make for a fun afternoon. It's a light rom-com with a few serious scenes.

She's an unsure woman, stemming from her parents' uncertainties, with a wry sense of humour. Macaulay (James Stewart) is one bitter writer, appearing angry until he turns into the kind Jimmy Stewart we love- and gets some great lines. Best Actor worthy though? Nah. Lastly Carey Grant plays the ex, put in a funny position. He's likable and well- handled. The Philadelphia Story has an unfortunate sticker attached to it: it came out in the same year as The Great Dictator. If you check out my review for that, you can see I like it just a little bit, just my favourite comedy of all time. If you asked which of these two films was better, I would choose The Great Dictator every time. While 'Philadelphia' is mostly concerned with telling a story, I found a recurring theme of 'invasion'. The media invades the home's privacy. The ex invades Tracy's privacy. The films shows alcohol influence over the body, and is important to the plot. Lastly, the uncle and the camera women.

If you like classics or the three major stars attached to this film, you'll like this well made film. 8.0/10

    The Philadelphia Story is about this. When a rich woman's ex-husband and a tabloid-type reporter turn up just before her planned remarriage, she begins to learn the truth about herself. Having watched this only a few weeks ago, I FINALLY am going to give my review on it. In my point of view, The Philadelphia Story is a great movie, it is a great romantic comedy film that is timeless, unforgettable, and a smashing good time! As a matter of fact, this movie is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all time, and not only that, but it is also one of the greatest movies of all time! Why did I want to see this movie in the first place? Because of all of the great things that I have heard about it, as well as the fact that it stars three of the greatest stars of all time, Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart. Every single one of the great things that have been said about this movie are true, it certainly is one of the best movies of all time! The great acting, the great directing, and the humor is proof of that, when you watch this movie, you'll see what I mean. Here's a few things that I have to say about the acting. In his only Oscar Winning performance, Jimmy Stewart (one of my all time favorite actors) shines. He plays a reporter who is getting some information about the wedding of Katharine Hepburn's character. Stewart was outstanding, he totally deserved the Oscar that he won. Cary Grant's performance is also nothing to sneeze at. In fact, Cary Grant could play a wide variety of characters, from comedy roles like this one and Arsenic and Old Lace, to serious roles like Notorious and North By Northwest. And of course Katarine Hepburn deserves mention as well. It is no surprise that the AFI ranked her the greatest female star of all time, because that is a ranking that she totally and completely deserved! So all in all, the great cast are yet another thing that contribute to the greatness of this movie! Not to mention that George Cukor did a great job directing this movie, he directed it in top form! Well anyway, The Philadelphia Story is another movie that I would call a great movie, it is not only one of the best romantic comedy movies ever made, but also one of the best movie movies ever made! This is also another one of those movies that you'll have to see over and over again, as you will love it when you see it for the first time! I am awarding this movie a rating of ten stars out of ten for being a perfect romantic comedy movie that did not disappoint me at all! Considering all of the great things that have been said about this movie, that means that you've got to see it! When you watch this, be prepared to see Katharine Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart, and Cary Grant at the top of their game! The Philadelphia Story is a masterpiece, one of the greatest movies ever made, directed by one of the greatest directors of all time, and starring three of the greatest actors of all time. 10/10

    This is the film that put Hepburn's career back on the map after being labeled "box office poison". It really is a nice film, with strong performances throughout, especially Hepburn as the aristocratic but uptight Tracy Lord. And she has seldom looked more beautiful than she does here; dressed to the nines in elegant dresses by Adrian and her famous red hair coiffed by Sydney Guilaroff. I did think that Ruth Hussey's character has too many smart-alecky lines; it makes her come across as if she is trying too hard. And I also take issue with the premise that Tracy Lord's father blames his daughter's attitude and disrespect toward him as reason for his infidelities to his wife  even when I saw this as a child, I didn't understand why an independent- minded (if a little uptight and controlling) woman would have to account for her dad's cheating. Such a load of BS. I know that we are supposed to take delight in these types of Hepburn films, where her high and mighty characters get humbled by those closest to them, and suddenly she becomes a "female". It makes for some good laughs, but it can also be really condescending and more than a bit sexist. I got the same impression in Woman of the Year as well. And finally, I still shake my head in disbelief that Jimmy Stewart was awarded a Best Actor Oscar for what essentially is a supporting role, and not really of Oscar caliber. I'll always believe that the Best Actor statue should have gone to Henry Fonda. Flaws aside, The Philadelphia Story has some great moments

    rare gem. for script and cast. for nuances and joy. for spirit and smart solutions. for music and performance. for subtle references and for each scene. it is difficult to say something about it because it represents total show. a show who seduce and amuse and define reality with few drops of wise and humor, pink romance and cold precise. and the great virtue is the science to show and use the gift, the art and the delicate manner to create force, soul and shadow of character by Hepburn, Grant and Steward. it can be a surprise. or a delight. it is not important the final verdict because it is only a state of sensibility. a movie. testimony of another time and flavor of admirable work.

    "Philadelphia Story" is a film staring three of my favorite actors of all times. Katherine Hepburn is a Philadelphia socialite who had recently recovered form a very traumatic divorce. She was married with Cary Grant, but their relationship had come to an end since she could not cope with his drinking problems and unwillingness to embrace perfection. Mrs. Hepburn's character is a member of the local high society, who sets high standards of behavior for herself and others around her. Therefore she would not tolerate even the slightest scandals within her close circle  a position that typically pushes someone into judging other people for each and every sin. Two years after she claims to have successfully overcome her previous marriage, Mrs. Hepburn announces she is going to re-marry an aspiring member of the jet set, in order to washout the stains from the past and restore balance and harmony to her life. That is when her ex-husband closes a deal with an important tabloid that is keen to have exclusive pictures of the wedding, pry into her personal life and luckily fill out headlines with intimate scandals. The scheme is to be carried out by a reporter and a photographer (James Stewart and Ruth Hussey), pretending to be close friends of the bride's absent brother. The plot is soon unveiled to the bride, but the others are not aware of what is taking place. The bride then starts to play a game of cat-and-mouse with the reporter. They eventually get terribly drunk and the truth literally comes out. It is a wonderful film, highly entertaining and incredibly avant garde. It deals with themes rarely seen in films of the time, such as female emancipation  divorce and re-marriage. It also exposes the industry of gossip, something that has grown to unfathomed levels since the film was released. The acting is also flawless. One of the highlights is the sequence where James Stewart's character, stinking of booze, is talking nonsense. It even deserved a compliment from Mr. Grant in 1985, when Mr. Stewart was awarded with an honorary Oscar. He stated that Mr. Stewart was asked to the scene a couple of times and it always came out impeccable. The man has truly mastered the art. The screenplay is about a journey into self-knowledge. Of course the underlying message is that only love makes us lower our guard and truly discover who we are. It is interesting to notice that this adage is still deemed the main thrust behind romantic comedies. That is not to say that there is just one way of transmitting this idea to the audience. On the contrary, rom-com is a never-extinguishing source for screen-writing and entertainment precisely because there are various forms of telling basically the same story. However, "Philadelphia Story" stands like a beacon over other rom-coms, providing an excellent example of how the genre can be thoughtful about human relations and simultaneously deliver excellent one-liners.

    The Philadelphia Story is a 1940 Comedy film directed by George Cukor and starring Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart. It is often seen in best-movies-ever lists, and is regarded even more frequently as one of the very best and most significant comedies of the 1940's. It is produced by Hollywood legend Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and is based on the play of the same name released a year prior to the film and shown on Broadway. Tracy (Katharine Hepburn) is an upper class woman who is about to remarry to a wealthy man of the people, George Kittredge. She already has another marriage behind her back, with another upper class-man (Cary Grant), but it ended up with a divorce because of his drinking problem. With the intent to sabotage the event, the ex-husband calls a journalist (James Stewart) to report on the wedding. The night before the wedding will drastically change the position of the to-be-wife because of this journalist. This movie is remembered as a classic for mainly one reason: the brilliant, witty and funny script. It unleashes some of the best dialogue of those years, and several quotes can be taken out of it because of how memorable they are. The actors don't do a bad job in delivering them either: the three main actor's exuberance and vivacity enlighten the atmosphere even more, with the help of other minor character such as the little girl or Tracy's father. It is a perfect example of a Romantic Comedy from the forties, of its sense of humor and its theatrical construct. It is in this last point though where the movie falls a bit; the first half of the film is overly theatrical and at the same time uneventful, with nothing really sticking up to be fun to watch. It is the second half of the movie that really saves it from narrative stagnation, and the viewer's eyes and ears are helplessly glued to what happens on the screen. The ending, like many movies of the time, ends in the absurd and unpredictable. Despite being an overall good movie, especially thanks to the second half, it doesn't have much of an artistic value compared to other comedies of the time. It has an amazing script and good, fun acting, but for a film to be great, there needs to be so much more than that.

    George Cukor directs "The Philadelphia Story". Now regarded as a classic, the films stars Katherine Hepburn as a wealthy socialite who clashes with tabloid reporters, ex lovers and her soon-to-be husband. The film was marketed as a satire, but isn't really. Despite Cukor's attempts at an anti-classist message, the film class condescends and paints Hepburn's working-class fianc&eacute;  a self-made man - as a bit of a buffoon. Still, this is a witty and sparkling film. Based on a Broadway play by Philip Barry, "The Philadelphia Story" overflows with one-liners and snappy dialogue. Characters trade barbs and ripostes like cannon volleys and Cukor's dapper cast do nothing but dazzle and sparkle and crackle with electricity. Iconic actors of the era are sprinkled about  Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant etc  but its Katharine Hepburn's performance that's typically the most celebrated (the NY Film Critics Circle gave her a best actress award for her role). Hepburn was a bit of an oddity in real life. A tomboy, the child of activist parents, very intelligent and rumoured to be gay or bisexual, the roles she played typically mirrored her own life. They're well educated characters, aloof, intelligent, confident, modern, sophisticated, share her preference for trousers over skirts (radical at the time), and of course are always distrustful of men. Able to cut men down to size with their brains, shrill voice and razor-sharp wit, Hepburn's characters quickly led to her becoming a feminist icon (and much later, a gay and lesbian icon). Her characters didn't need men, didn't even seem to need sex (indeed they were often sexually frigid) and were almost always fully independent and autonomous. That is, of course, until the final acts of her films. Almost all her characters are eventually beaten down, tamed and subjugated by lowbrow, carnal, earthly men. The most overt examples are perhaps "The African Queen" and "The Rainmaker", but we see this in "The Philadelphia Story" as well, in which Hepburn reigns for three acts before being domesticated and restored to a safe position. Incidentally, Cukor was himself homosexual. He'd work with Hepburn on a number of pictures, as well as Spencer Tracy and Cary Grant, all of whom faced allegations of homosexuality and/or bisexuality. Cukor's work, like that of Douglas Sirk (also rumoured to be gay), was frequently disparaged in the past. He was deemed a director of "mere women's pictures". Today both have been rehabilitated by film historians, who celebrate the duo for capturing various social undercurrents, psychological or gender complexities. Indeed, most of Cukor's films feature female protagonists, have a feminine sensibility and are told from a woman's point-of-view. Even when he'd drift into traditionally masculine genres, like his western, "Heller in Pink Tights", the style employed would be bizarrely vibrant, almost camp, with lavish colours, opulent sets and women in chief roles. And of course Cukor was responsible for one of the earliest gender bending films. Released in 1936, "Sylvia Scarlett" starred Hepburn again as a rule breaker who masquerades as a boy and attracts sexual attention from both women and men. Filled with sexual misunderstandings and "coming outs", the film, like Cukor's best films, had a hint of autobiography. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    George Cukor's "The Philadelphia Story" was released in 1940 and starred the ultimate Hollywood trinity: Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant. Being a romantic comedy, we suspect she will end up with one of these two. And since she's about to marry a boring guy named George, we quickly understand that she will not marry him, and that the whole story will consist on leading us to that conclusion in two hours, two endlessly and unstoppably long hours. I hate to use the word 'overrated' and 'overacted' so I guess the wrong mindset would be an inevitable obstacle between this movie and me. Being the average schmuck I am, I couldn't relate to Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord, a young and wealthy socialite praised, adored, worshiped by the other schmucks of her community. For my biggest displeasure, I couldn't even relate to James Stewart because as much as I loved his roles in Capra films, I didn't find any invitation for empathy in his character as Macaulay Connor, the wannabe writer and tabloid journalist for a magazine fittingly named 'Spy". I could care about Cary Grant as C.K. (as in 'CocKy) Dexter Morgan, the ex-husband, if only for the hilarious way he palms Tracy's face and pushes her down to the floor. But isn't it a bad omen when the film's most memorable instant happens within the first minute. But despite the brilliance of the gesture and the male charisma he naturally exuded, in that particular film, he seemed rather lifeless to me, bored by the whole gossipy environment (I can't blame him) and only there to recite his lines, to create a false impression of chemistry with Tracy. I couldn't stand his constant grin, but not as much as Hepburn's trademark 'Bryn Mawr" accent (thanks IMDb) that got quickly on my nerves, this 'yawr', 'dahling' or this expression as if she wanted us to check if she had salad stuck in her teeth. But don't take my iconoclasm very seriously, I'm an unexceptional reviewer. In fact, I'm so mediocre, compared to these icons I dare to criticize that I even rooted for John Howard's character as George Kettridge, the target of a whole conspiracy from the director, the writer and the actors. They spared no efforts to mock and belittle George, he was a hypocrite, an ambitious man, but I have to see it to believe it, after all, neither Grant or Connor had better intentions and George seemed a rather decent man. Anyway, they were all so mean-spirited than my immediate reaction was to take his side. At least, in usual screwball comedies, it's one rival against another; here the guy has no chance standing against the two men and his own fianc&eacute; plotting against him. And watching the beautiful Tracy Lord swinging back and forth from Connor to Morgan like a tennis ball was embarrassing, not to mention the ludicrous ending. "Marry me, Tracy", she's reluctant because it wouldn't please his girlfriend photographer Liz (Ruth Hussey). Naturally, Liz doesn't mind being used as a Plan B, nor does Tracy to get back to her precedent husband. Damn, I'm almost glad Georgie got himself out of this mess. The film had its moments though, I liked the part where Stewart pretended to be drunk and you could see at one moment that both him and Grant were trying not to laugh, that was my favorite moment of the film: it was genuine, charming and innocent and it allowed us to forget about the intricacy of the plot. Speaking of that 'drunk' scene, I'm not sure either that Stewart deserved the Oscar, I know it was a compensation for his loss in 1939, but seriously was he better than Henry Fonda in "Grapes of Wrath", or even as a comedic performance, was he better than Charlie Chaplin in "The Great Dictator"? I could concede anything to the movie, maybe if I watched it a third or fourth time, I will end up believing it's a masterpiece, but I don't think I would praise Stewart's performance, I didn't even think it was worthy of a nomination. The writing also won an Oscar, but then again, it's adapted from a play, it has the kind of prefabricated wit that was overexploited in screwball classics, but for some reason, I don't think these kinds of artificial exchange fit the silver screen. Maybe it's the whole vaudeville thing, but I grew rapidly tired of these dialogs where you get the feeling that each character is trying to outsmart the other, and naturally, George is the biggest target, he receives them and seems incapable to say one word or two to Grant or Stewart. From funny, it gets incredibly redundant and ruins the poignancy or the intelligent lucidity some scenes genuinely provides. Granted it's not meant to be realistic, and people have to be entertained, but at one point, it's just words, words, words, or like would say Hepburn "wohds, wohds, wohds". And I guess I've seen enough classics not to feel guilty about this one. And please, don't get me started on the so-called feminist undertones just because Hepburn plays a very strong and outspoken character. If one thing, the film proves (and quite realistically) that a woman can be as strong, as bossy, as a bully as a man IF she's rich. It attacks the core of feminism, which is the perpetual antagonism between men and women by showing that it's only a matter of rich vs. poor. It's funny how the film works better as a social commentary, and it's only by realizing that she wouldn't live with a man who'd prevent her from freedom by letting her drink and loosen up, that Tracy goes with the rich guy, of course, only rich can afford to be decadent. "There goes George", sings Grant to ridicule him, just ignore them, George, you're the unsung hero of "The Philadelphia Story"

    "The Philadelphia Story" is a classic, romantic comedy that features a dash of wit and a strong cast of actors. The concept of three men vying for a women's attention has been a bit overplayed in recent years (think "This Means War," "Twilight," "10 Things I Hate about You") but "The Philadelphia Story" did it right first. Tracy Lord, played by actress Katherine Hepburn, set the bar high as she plays the role with elegance, smarts and humor. Tracy is a fiercely independent woman with her own opinion and Hepburn embodies her from the length of her perfect posture to the confident stride of her walk. The other stand-out character whose charm radiates from the screen via his overprotective persona (even though he violently pushes Hepburn to the ground in the very first scene) is Cary Grant, who plays Tracy's ex-husband. Later on in the film, Grant follows up with more violence as he punches a suitor of Tracy to prove a point to her fianc&eacute;e. When he can't find the words to handle a situation, Grant turns to violence. Growing up, I was taught that violence never solves problems, but apparently Grant had a more interesting home life as a kid. Wealth, class, and exploitation are common motifs that circulate the plot. In a pivotal scene, that shows of Tracy's swift, logical thinking skills, the family learns that the journalists are from Spy Magazine, a tabloid. Due to the family's wealth, the tabloid violates the family's privacy just as the ex violates Tracy's privacy by trying to manipulate he. The celebrity concepts of tabloids and live-in journalists reminded me of the reality shows popular in today's culture. Just as most reality shows progress, the family attempted to be on their best behavior at first, but eventually their true personalities came out. I didn't realize that the concepts of tabloids and paparazzi were prevalent in society this early on. Alcohol is also a reoccurring problem. Alcohol was the reason behind Tracy and her ex-husbands divorce and later on serves as a factor that pushes her new relationship off the edge. At least with my exposure to film, Tracy's alcohol usage is a symptom of a good-girl-gone-bad trend, like in "Mean Girls". In most young adult rebellion films, alcohol contributes to the downfall of innocence. Therefore, in "The Philadelphia Story," alcohol is behind Tracy's mistakes and enlightenment. While I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and the clothing styles of the film, I was a bit put off by the Sexism. I know that women were not treated equally to men in this time era but Tracy was put down by her own father when she shared her opinions and regarded as a Goddess by her male suitors. I don't think she had any radical ideas so I am not sure what all the fuss was about.I also don't understand why it was Tracy's responsibility to make up a story just so her dad wouldn't get in trouble. I guess the wealthy went to great lengths to protect their public perceptions back in the day too. A great portion of this film was dedicated to watching Tracy grow into her own person. I almost find that I am internalizing a backwards message because messages in today's society are tend to relate to women finding their own way through independence and Tracy goes from being independent and outspoken to being almost pressured to marry her ex at the last minute. Nonetheless, Tracy has been plucked from the wilderness and planted in a pot. Through the usage of alcohol and an invasion of privacy, Tracy is no longer the free-spirited, wild blossom she was at the start of the film. She now knows the dangers of outside forces and has decided to settle down with a husband instead of facing the world on her own.

    Firstly, I watched this as a Korean import DVD, which is quite a bit cheaper but possibly, of inferior quality. There's only one disc, for starters and once subtitles have been switched off, plays like any other, though reviewers have mentioned the excellent transfer of the version advertised. This one is very good, thankfully without the dreaded juddery panning shots that I so often suffer with Korean ones, but it's not as crisp as I know other films of this period can be. Philadelphia Story is undoubtedly an evergreen classic. The getting drunk scenes with Katherine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart and the romantic "results" are sent from heaven, the chemistry, Jimmy's famous drawl, the shimmering lighting - beautiful and touching. Magic. This film can be seen countless times; its mixture of satire, romance, comedy and sheer story have probably never been bettered on screen. That it features three of the biggest acting stars on the planet at the time, who actually DO get on with each other, no off-set personality clashes (that I'm aware of) that might spill over into the scenes, creates a real sense of ease and naturalness. Philly Story is essential viewing to all true lovers of film - even if it's not your usual fare, it's an example of how to make a film. For fans of either Grant, Hepburn or Stewart, you've been missing a great deal and seeing them together WILL change your life, well, at least your enjoyment of it!

    IMDb Top 250: 248 The Philadelphia Story is a nice film, a classic comedy with lots of good jokes and heavy star power. Not much commitment is needed to enjoy it, and it can make for a fun afternoon. It's a light rom-com with a few serious scenes. It falls squarely into the category of "see if it it's there, but not worth going out of your way to see". The scene is set with a 'reporter' team going to cover a socialite's wedding with the bride-to-be's ex as a guide: humour, romance and "innundo" ensure. The pace is relaxed throughout, with a slump around the 45 minute mark, but it is made up for by a strong last 45, and an ending that tosses a few twists right until the very end. 'Philadelphia' is worth your time because of its characters and their excellent dialogue. Tracy Lord (Katherine Hepburn) is a socialite, a Kim Kardashian of her day, apparently famous for no reason. She's an unsure woman, stemming from her parents' uncertainties, with a wry sense of humour. Macaulay (James Stewart) is one bitter writer, appearing angry until he turns into the kind Jimmy Stewart we love- and gets some great lines. Best Actor worthy though? Nah. Lastly Carey Grant plays the ex, put in a funny position. He's likable and well- handled. The Philadelphia Story has an unfortunate sticker attached to it: it came out in the same year as The Great Dictator. If you check out my review for that, you can see I like it just a little bit, just my favourite comedy of all time. If you asked which of these two films was better, I would choose The Great Dictator every time. While 'Philadelphia' is mostly concerned with telling a story, I found a recurring theme of 'invasion'. The media invades the home's privacy. The ex invades Tracy's privacy. The films shows alcohol influence over the body, and is important to the plot. Lastly, the uncle and the camera women. Maybe this is a coincidence, but it's a good one. Again, the focus of the film is telling a story and making you snicker, where it succeeds. If you like classics or the three major stars attached to this film, you'll like this well made film. 8.0/10

    The Philadelphia Story is about this. When a rich woman's ex-husband and a tabloid-type reporter turn up just before her planned remarriage, she begins to learn the truth about herself. Having watched this only a few weeks ago, I FINALLY am going to give my review on it. In my point of view, The Philadelphia Story is a great movie, it is a great romantic comedy film that is timeless, unforgettable, and a smashing good time! As a matter of fact, this movie is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all time, and not only that, but it is also one of the greatest movies of all time! Why did I want to see this movie in the first place? Because of all of the great things that I have heard about it, as well as the fact that it stars three of the greatest stars of all time, Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart. Every single one of the great things that have been said about this movie are true, it certainly is one of the best movies of all time! The great acting, the great directing, and the humor is proof of that, when you watch this movie, you'll see what I mean. Here's a few things that I have to say about the acting. In his only Oscar Winning performance, Jimmy Stewart (one of my all time favorite actors) shines. He plays a reporter who is getting some information about the wedding of Katharine Hepburn's character. Stewart was outstanding, he totally deserved the Oscar that he won. Cary Grant's performance is also nothing to sneeze at. In fact, Cary Grant could play a wide variety of characters, from comedy roles like this one and Arsenic and Old Lace, to serious roles like Notorious and North By Northwest. And of course Katarine Hepburn deserves mention as well. It is no surprise that the AFI ranked her the greatest female star of all time, because that is a ranking that she totally and completely deserved! So all in all, the great cast are yet another thing that contribute to the greatness of this movie! Not to mention that George Cukor did a great job directing this movie, he directed it in top form! Well anyway, The Philadelphia Story is another movie that I would call a great movie, it is not only one of the best romantic comedy movies ever made, but also one of the best movie movies ever made! This is also another one of those movies that you'll have to see over and over again, as you will love it when you see it for the first time! I am awarding this movie a rating of ten stars out of ten for being a perfect romantic comedy movie that did not disappoint me at all! Considering all of the great things that have been said about this movie, that means that you've got to see it! When you watch this, be prepared to see Katharine Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart, and Cary Grant at the top of their game! The Philadelphia Story is a masterpiece, one of the greatest movies ever made, directed by one of the greatest directors of all time, and starring three of the greatest actors of all time. 10/10

    This is the film that put Hepburn's career back on the map after being labeled "box office poison". It really is a nice film, with strong performances throughout, especially Hepburn as the aristocratic but uptight Tracy Lord. And she has seldom looked more beautiful than she does here; dressed to the nines in elegant dresses by Adrian and her famous red hair coiffed by Sydney Guilaroff. I did think that Ruth Hussey's character has too many smart-alecky lines; it makes her come across as if she is trying too hard. And I also take issue with the premise that Tracy Lord's father blames his daughter's attitude and disrespect toward him as reason for his infidelities to his wife  even when I saw this as a child, I didn't understand why an independent- minded (if a little uptight and controlling) woman would have to account for her dad's cheating. Such a load of BS. I know that we are supposed to take delight in these types of Hepburn films, where her high and mighty characters get humbled by those closest to them, and suddenly she becomes a "female". It makes for some good laughs, but it can also be really condescending and more than a bit sexist. I got the same impression in Woman of the Year as well. And finally, I still shake my head in disbelief that Jimmy Stewart was awarded a Best Actor Oscar for what essentially is a supporting role, and not really of Oscar caliber. I'll always believe that the Best Actor statue should have gone to Henry Fonda. Flaws aside, The Philadelphia Story has some great moments

    rare gem. for script and cast. for nuances and joy. for spirit and smart solutions. for music and performance. for subtle references and for each scene. it is difficult to say something about it because it represents total show. a show who seduce and amuse and define reality with few drops of wise and humor, pink romance and cold precise. and the great virtue is the science to show and use the gift, the art and the delicate manner to create force, soul and shadow of character by Hepburn, Grant and Steward. it can be a surprise. or a delight. it is not important the final verdict because it is only a state of sensibility. a movie. testimony of another time and flavor of admirable work.

    "Philadelphia Story" is a film staring three of my favorite actors of all times. Katherine Hepburn is a Philadelphia socialite who had recently recovered form a very traumatic divorce. She was married with Cary Grant, but their relationship had come to an end since she could not cope with his drinking problems and unwillingness to embrace perfection. Mrs. Hepburn's character is a member of the local high society, who sets high standards of behavior for herself and others around her. Therefore she would not tolerate even the slightest scandals within her close circle  a position that typically pushes someone into judging other people for each and every sin. Two years after she claims to have successfully overcome her previous marriage, Mrs. Hepburn announces she is going to re-marry an aspiring member of the jet set, in order to washout the stains from the past and restore balance and harmony to her life. That is when her ex-husband closes a deal with an important tabloid that is keen to have exclusive pictures of the wedding, pry into her personal life and luckily fill out headlines with intimate scandals. The scheme is to be carried out by a reporter and a photographer (James Stewart and Ruth Hussey), pretending to be close friends of the bride's absent brother. The plot is soon unveiled to the bride, but the others are not aware of what is taking place. The bride then starts to play a game of cat-and-mouse with the reporter. They eventually get terribly drunk and the truth literally comes out. It is a wonderful film, highly entertaining and incredibly avant garde. It deals with themes rarely seen in films of the time, such as female emancipation  divorce and re-marriage. It also exposes the industry of gossip, something that has grown to unfathomed levels since the film was released. The acting is also flawless. One of the highlights is the sequence where James Stewart's character, stinking of booze, is talking nonsense. It even deserved a compliment from Mr. Grant in 1985, when Mr. Stewart was awarded with an honorary Oscar. He stated that Mr. Stewart was asked to the scene a couple of times and it always came out impeccable. The man has truly mastered the art. The screenplay is about a journey into self-knowledge. Of course the underlying message is that only love makes us lower our guard and truly discover who we are. It is interesting to notice that this adage is still deemed the main thrust behind romantic comedies. That is not to say that there is just one way of transmitting this idea to the audience. On the contrary, rom-com is a never-extinguishing source for screen-writing and entertainment precisely because there are various forms of telling basically the same story. However, "Philadelphia Story" stands like a beacon over other rom-coms, providing an excellent example of how the genre can be thoughtful about human relations and simultaneously deliver excellent one-liners.

    The Philadelphia Story is a 1940 Comedy film directed by George Cukor and starring Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart. It is often seen in best-movies-ever lists, and is regarded even more frequently as one of the very best and most significant comedies of the 1940's. It is produced by Hollywood legend Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and is based on the play of the same name released a year prior to the film and shown on Broadway. Tracy (Katharine Hepburn) is an upper class woman who is about to remarry to a wealthy man of the people, George Kittredge. She already has another marriage behind her back, with another upper class-man (Cary Grant), but it ended up with a divorce because of his drinking problem. With the intent to sabotage the event, the ex-husband calls a journalist (James Stewart) to report on the wedding. The night before the wedding will drastically change the position of the to-be-wife because of this journalist. This movie is remembered as a classic for mainly one reason: the brilliant, witty and funny script. It unleashes some of the best dialogue of those years, and several quotes can be taken out of it because of how memorable they are. The actors don't do a bad job in delivering them either: the three main actor's exuberance and vivacity enlighten the atmosphere even more, with the help of other minor character such as the little girl or Tracy's father. It is a perfect example of a Romantic Comedy from the forties, of its sense of humor and its theatrical construct. It is in this last point though where the movie falls a bit; the first half of the film is overly theatrical and at the same time uneventful, with nothing really sticking up to be fun to watch. It is the second half of the movie that really saves it from narrative stagnation, and the viewer's eyes and ears are helplessly glued to what happens on the screen. The ending, like many movies of the time, ends in the absurd and unpredictable. Despite being an overall good movie, especially thanks to the second half, it doesn't have much of an artistic value compared to other comedies of the time. It has an amazing script and good, fun acting, but for a film to be great, there needs to be so much more than that.

    George Cukor directs "The Philadelphia Story". Now regarded as a classic, the films stars Katherine Hepburn as a wealthy socialite who clashes with tabloid reporters, ex lovers and her soon-to-be husband. The film was marketed as a satire, but isn't really. Despite Cukor's attempts at an anti-classist message, the film class condescends and paints Hepburn's working-class fianc&eacute;  a self-made man - as a bit of a buffoon. Still, this is a witty and sparkling film. Based on a Broadway play by Philip Barry, "The Philadelphia Story" overflows with one-liners and snappy dialogue. Characters trade barbs and ripostes like cannon volleys and Cukor's dapper cast do nothing but dazzle and sparkle and crackle with electricity. Iconic actors of the era are sprinkled about  Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant etc  but its Katharine Hepburn's performance that's typically the most celebrated (the NY Film Critics Circle gave her a best actress award for her role). Hepburn was a bit of an oddity in real life. A tomboy, the child of activist parents, very intelligent and rumoured to be gay or bisexual, the roles she played typically mirrored her own life. They're well educated characters, aloof, intelligent, confident, modern, sophisticated, share her preference for trousers over skirts (radical at the time), and of course are always distrustful of men. Able to cut men down to size with their brains, shrill voice and razor-sharp wit, Hepburn's characters quickly led to her becoming a feminist icon (and much later, a gay and lesbian icon). Her characters didn't need men, didn't even seem to need sex (indeed they were often sexually frigid) and were almost always fully independent and autonomous. That is, of course, until the final acts of her films. Almost all her characters are eventually beaten down, tamed and subjugated by lowbrow, carnal, earthly men. The most overt examples are perhaps "The African Queen" and "The Rainmaker", but we see this in "The Philadelphia Story" as well, in which Hepburn reigns for three acts before being domesticated and restored to a safe position. Incidentally, Cukor was himself homosexual. He'd work with Hepburn on a number of pictures, as well as Spencer Tracy and Cary Grant, all of whom faced allegations of homosexuality and/or bisexuality. Cukor's work, like that of Douglas Sirk (also rumoured to be gay), was frequently disparaged in the past. He was deemed a director of "mere women's pictures". Today both have been rehabilitated by film historians, who celebrate the duo for capturing various social undercurrents, psychological or gender complexities. Indeed, most of Cukor's films feature female protagonists, have a feminine sensibility and are told from a woman's point-of-view. Even when he'd drift into traditionally masculine genres, like his western, "Heller in Pink Tights", the style employed would be bizarrely vibrant, almost camp, with lavish colours, opulent sets and women in chief roles. And of course Cukor was responsible for one of the earliest gender bending films. Released in 1936, "Sylvia Scarlett" starred Hepburn again as a rule breaker who masquerades as a boy and attracts sexual attention from both women and men. Filled with sexual misunderstandings and "coming outs", the film, like Cukor's best films, had a hint of autobiography. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    George Cukor's "The Philadelphia Story" was released in 1940 and starred the ultimate Hollywood trinity: Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant. Being a romantic comedy, we suspect she will end up with one of these two. And since she's about to marry a boring guy named George, we quickly understand that she will not marry him, and that the whole story will consist on leading us to that conclusion in two hours, two endlessly and unstoppably long hours. I hate to use the word 'overrated' and 'overacted' so I guess the wrong mindset would be an inevitable obstacle between this movie and me. Being the average schmuck I am, I couldn't relate to Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord, a young and wealthy socialite praised, adored, worshiped by the other schmucks of her community. For my biggest displeasure, I couldn't even relate to James Stewart because as much as I loved his roles in Capra films, I didn't find any invitation for empathy in his character as Macaulay Connor, the wannabe writer and tabloid journalist for a magazine fittingly named 'Spy". I could care about Cary Grant as C.K. (as in 'CocKy) Dexter Morgan, the ex-husband, if only for the hilarious way he palms Tracy's face and pushes her down to the floor. But isn't it a bad omen when the film's most memorable instant happens within the first minute. But despite the brilliance of the gesture and the male charisma he naturally exuded, in that particular film, he seemed rather lifeless to me, bored by the whole gossipy environment (I can't blame him) and only there to recite his lines, to create a false impression of chemistry with Tracy. I couldn't stand his constant grin, but not as much as Hepburn's trademark 'Bryn Mawr" accent (thanks IMDb) that got quickly on my nerves, this 'yawr', 'dahling' or this expression as if she wanted us to check if she had salad stuck in her teeth. But don't take my iconoclasm very seriously, I'm an unexceptional reviewer. In fact, I'm so mediocre, compared to these icons I dare to criticize that I even rooted for John Howard's character as George Kettridge, the target of a whole conspiracy from the director, the writer and the actors. They spared no efforts to mock and belittle George, he was a hypocrite, an ambitious man, but I have to see it to believe it, after all, neither Grant or Connor had better intentions and George seemed a rather decent man. Anyway, they were all so mean-spirited than my immediate reaction was to take his side. At least, in usual screwball comedies, it's one rival against another; here the guy has no chance standing against the two men and his own fianc&eacute; plotting against him. And watching the beautiful Tracy Lord swinging back and forth from Connor to Morgan like a tennis ball was embarrassing, not to mention the ludicrous ending. "Marry me, Tracy", she's reluctant because it wouldn't please his girlfriend photographer Liz (Ruth Hussey). Naturally, Liz doesn't mind being used as a Plan B, nor does Tracy to get back to her precedent husband. Damn, I'm almost glad Georgie got himself out of this mess. The film had its moments though, I liked the part where Stewart pretended to be drunk and you could see at one moment that both him and Grant were trying not to laugh, that was my favorite moment of the film: it was genuine, charming and innocent and it allowed us to forget about the intricacy of the plot. Speaking of that 'drunk' scene, I'm not sure either that Stewart deserved the Oscar, I know it was a compensation for his loss in 1939, but seriously was he better than Henry Fonda in "Grapes of Wrath", or even as a comedic performance, was he better than Charlie Chaplin in "The Great Dictator"? I could concede anything to the movie, maybe if I watched it a third or fourth time, I will end up believing it's a masterpiece, but I don't think I would praise Stewart's performance, I didn't even think it was worthy of a nomination. The writing also won an Oscar, but then again, it's adapted from a play, it has the kind of prefabricated wit that was overexploited in screwball classics, but for some reason, I don't think these kinds of artificial exchange fit the silver screen. Maybe it's the whole vaudeville thing, but I grew rapidly tired of these dialogs where you get the feeling that each character is trying to outsmart the other, and naturally, George is the biggest target, he receives them and seems incapable to say one word or two to Grant or Stewart. From funny, it gets incredibly redundant and ruins the poignancy or the intelligent lucidity some scenes genuinely provides. Granted it's not meant to be realistic, and people have to be entertained, but at one point, it's just words, words, words, or like would say Hepburn "wohds, wohds, wohds". And I guess I've seen enough classics not to feel guilty about this one. And please, don't get me started on the so-called feminist undertones just because Hepburn plays a very strong and outspoken character. If one thing, the film proves (and quite realistically) that a woman can be as strong, as bossy, as a bully as a man IF she's rich. It attacks the core of feminism, which is the perpetual antagonism between men and women by showing that it's only a matter of rich vs. poor. It's funny how the film works better as a social commentary, and it's only by realizing that she wouldn't live with a man who'd prevent her from freedom by letting her drink and loosen up, that Tracy goes with the rich guy, of course, only rich can afford to be decadent. "There goes George", sings Grant to ridicule him, just ignore them, George, you're the unsung hero of "The Philadelphia Story"

    "The Philadelphia Story" is a classic, romantic comedy that features a dash of wit and a strong cast of actors. The concept of three men vying for a women's attention has been a bit overplayed in recent years (think "This Means War," "Twilight," "10 Things I Hate about You") but "The Philadelphia Story" did it right first. Tracy Lord, played by actress Katherine Hepburn, set the bar high as she plays the role with elegance, smarts and humor. Tracy is a fiercely independent woman with her own opinion and Hepburn embodies her from the length of her perfect posture to the confident stride of her walk. The other stand-out character whose charm radiates from the screen via his overprotective persona (even though he violently pushes Hepburn to the ground in the very first scene) is Cary Grant, who plays Tracy's ex-husband. Later on in the film, Grant follows up with more violence as he punches a suitor of Tracy to prove a point to her fianc&eacute;e. When he can't find the words to handle a situation, Grant turns to violence. Growing up, I was taught that violence never solves problems, but apparently Grant had a more interesting home life as a kid. Wealth, class, and exploitation are common motifs that circulate the plot. In a pivotal scene, that shows of Tracy's swift, logical thinking skills, the family learns that the journalists are from Spy Magazine, a tabloid. Due to the family's wealth, the tabloid violates the family's privacy just as the ex violates Tracy's privacy by trying to manipulate he. The celebrity concepts of tabloids and live-in journalists reminded me of the reality shows popular in today's culture. Just as most reality shows progress, the family attempted to be on their best behavior at first, but eventually their true personalities came out. I didn't realize that the concepts of tabloids and paparazzi were prevalent in society this early on. Alcohol is also a reoccurring problem. Alcohol was the reason behind Tracy and her ex-husbands divorce and later on serves as a factor that pushes her new relationship off the edge. At least with my exposure to film, Tracy's alcohol usage is a symptom of a good-girl-gone-bad trend, like in "Mean Girls". In most young adult rebellion films, alcohol contributes to the downfall of innocence. Therefore, in "The Philadelphia Story," alcohol is behind Tracy's mistakes and enlightenment. While I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and the clothing styles of the film, I was a bit put off by the Sexism. I know that women were not treated equally to men in this time era but Tracy was put down by her own father when she shared her opinions and regarded as a Goddess by her male suitors. I don't think she had any radical ideas so I am not sure what all the fuss was about.I also don't understand why it was Tracy's responsibility to make up a story just so her dad wouldn't get in trouble. I guess the wealthy went to great lengths to protect their public perceptions back in the day too. A great portion of this film was dedicated to watching Tracy grow into her own person. I almost find that I am internalizing a backwards message because messages in today's society are tend to relate to women finding their own way through independence and Tracy goes from being independent and outspoken to being almost pressured to marry her ex at the last minute. Nonetheless, Tracy has been plucked from the wilderness and planted in a pot. Through the usage of alcohol and an invasion of privacy, Tracy is no longer the free-spirited, wild blossom she was at the start of the film. She now knows the dangers of outside forces and has decided to settle down with a husband instead of facing the world on her own.

    Firstly, I watched this as a Korean import DVD, which is quite a bit cheaper but possibly, of inferior quality. There's only one disc, for starters and once subtitles have been switched off, plays like any other, though reviewers have mentioned the excellent transfer of the version advertised. This one is very good, thankfully without the dreaded juddery panning shots that I so often suffer with Korean ones, but it's not as crisp as I know other films of this period can be. Philadelphia Story is undoubtedly an evergreen classic. The getting drunk scenes with Katherine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart and the romantic "results" are sent from heaven, the chemistry, Jimmy's famous drawl, the shimmering lighting - beautiful and touching. Magic. This film can be seen countless times; its mixture of satire, romance, comedy and sheer story have probably never been bettered on screen. That it features three of the biggest acting stars on the planet at the time, who actually DO get on with each other, no off-set personality clashes (that I'm aware of) that might spill over into the scenes, creates a real sense of ease and naturalness. Philly Story is essential viewing to all true lovers of film - even if it's not your usual fare, it's an example of how to make a film. For fans of either Grant, Hepburn or Stewart, you've been missing a great deal and seeing them together WILL change your life, well, at least your enjoyment of it!

    IMDb Top 250: 248 The Philadelphia Story is a nice film, a classic comedy with lots of good jokes and heavy star power. Not much commitment is needed to enjoy it, and it can make for a fun afternoon. It's a light rom-com with a few serious scenes. It falls squarely into the category of "see if it it's there, but not worth going out of your way to see". The scene is set with a 'reporter' team going to cover a socialite's wedding with the bride-to-be's ex as a guide: humour, romance and "innundo" ensure. The pace is relaxed throughout, with a slump around the 45 minute mark, but it is made up for by a strong last 45, and an ending that tosses a few twists right until the very end. 'Philadelphia' is worth your time because of its characters and their excellent dialogue. Tracy Lord (Katherine Hepburn) is a socialite, a Kim Kardashian of her day, apparently famous for no reason. She's an unsure woman, stemming from her parents' uncertainties, with a wry sense of humour. Macaulay (James Stewart) is one bitter writer, appearing angry until he turns into the kind Jimmy Stewart we love- and gets some great lines. Best Actor worthy though? Nah. Lastly Carey Grant plays the ex, put in a funny position. He's likable and well- handled. The Philadelphia Story has an unfortunate sticker attached to it: it came out in the same year as The Great Dictator. If you check out my review for that, you can see I like it just a little bit, just my favourite comedy of all time. If you asked which of these two films was better, I would choose The Great Dictator every time. While 'Philadelphia' is mostly concerned with telling a story, I found a recurring theme of 'invasion'. The media invades the home's privacy. The ex invades Tracy's privacy. The films shows alcohol influence over the body, and is important to the plot. Lastly, the uncle and the camera women. Maybe this is a coincidence, but it's a good one. Again, the focus of the film is telling a story and making you snicker, where it succeeds. If you like classics or the three major stars attached to this film, you'll like this well made film. 8.0/10

    The Philadelphia Story is about this. When a rich woman's ex-husband and a tabloid-type reporter turn up just before her planned remarriage, she begins to learn the truth about herself. Having watched this only a few weeks ago, I FINALLY am going to give my review on it. In my point of view, The Philadelphia Story is a great movie, it is a great romantic comedy film that is timeless, unforgettable, and a smashing good time! As a matter of fact, this movie is one of the greatest romantic comedy films of all time, and not only that, but it is also one of the greatest movies of all time! Why did I want to see this movie in the first place? Because of all of the great things that I have heard about it, as well as the fact that it stars three of the greatest stars of all time, Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart. Every single one of the great things that have been said about this movie are true, it certainly is one of the best movies of all time! The great acting, the great directing, and the humor is proof of that, when you watch this movie, you'll see what I mean. Here's a few things that I have to say about the acting. In his only Oscar Winning performance, Jimmy Stewart (one of my all time favorite actors) shines. He plays a reporter who is getting some information about the wedding of Katharine Hepburn's character. Stewart was outstanding, he totally deserved the Oscar that he won. Cary Grant's performance is also nothing to sneeze at. In fact, Cary Grant could play a wide variety of characters, from comedy roles like this one and Arsenic and Old Lace, to serious roles like Notorious and North By Northwest. And of course Katarine Hepburn deserves mention as well. It is no surprise that the AFI ranked her the greatest female star of all time, because that is a ranking that she totally and completely deserved! So all in all, the great cast are yet another thing that contribute to the greatness of this movie! Not to mention that George Cukor did a great job directing this movie, he directed it in top form! Well anyway, The Philadelphia Story is another movie that I would call a great movie, it is not only one of the best romantic comedy movies ever made, but also one of the best movie movies ever made! This is also another one of those movies that you'll have to see over and over again, as you will love it when you see it for the first time! I am awarding this movie a rating of ten stars out of ten for being a perfect romantic comedy movie that did not disappoint me at all! Considering all of the great things that have been said about this movie, that means that you've got to see it! When you watch this, be prepared to see Katharine Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart, and Cary Grant at the top of their game! The Philadelphia Story is a masterpiece, one of the greatest movies ever made, directed by one of the greatest directors of all time, and starring three of the greatest actors of all time. 10/10

    This is the film that put Hepburn's career back on the map after being labeled "box office poison". It really is a nice film, with strong performances throughout, especially Hepburn as the aristocratic but uptight Tracy Lord. And she has seldom looked more beautiful than she does here; dressed to the nines in elegant dresses by Adrian and her famous red hair coiffed by Sydney Guilaroff. I did think that Ruth Hussey's character has too many smart-alecky lines; it makes her come across as if she is trying too hard. And I also take issue with the premise that Tracy Lord's father blames his daughter's attitude and disrespect toward him as reason for his infidelities to his wife  even when I saw this as a child, I didn't understand why an independent- minded (if a little uptight and controlling) woman would have to account for her dad's cheating. Such a load of BS. I know that we are supposed to take delight in these types of Hepburn films, where her high and mighty characters get humbled by those closest to them, and suddenly she becomes a "female". It makes for some good laughs, but it can also be really condescending and more than a bit sexist. I got the same impression in Woman of the Year as well. And finally, I still shake my head in disbelief that Jimmy Stewart was awarded a Best Actor Oscar for what essentially is a supporting role, and not really of Oscar caliber. I'll always believe that the Best Actor statue should have gone to Henry Fonda. Flaws aside, The Philadelphia Story has some great moments
