 <sinopse>
  A living puppet, with the help of a cricket as his conscience, must prove himself worthy to become a real boy.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Inventor Gepetto creates a wooden marionette called Pinocchio. His wish that Pinocchio be a real boy is unexpectedly granted by a fairy. The fairy assigns Jiminy Cricket to act as Pinocchio's "conscience" and keep him out of trouble. Jiminy is not too successful in this endeavor and most of the film is spent with Pinocchio deep in trouble.

    Pinocchio is a breathtaking movie. It is one of the most beautiful animated movies. The story is engaging, the settings are magical, the characters are great, it simply embraces you with everything. Mixing its "dark" elements, and its "creepy" tone, with the "magical" atmosphere and the "uniqueness" of the movie, it all works out amazingly, and it makes the movie so authentic. It is hard to think Pinocchio was released just one year after Snow White, and that the production started just 3 years after Snow White's started. The animation is just wonderful, and the movie is not far away from being perfect. It is an engrossing, timeless movie. This is undoubtedly Disney Masterpiece. Its high quality proves that Pinocchio is one of the best animated movies...

    I have seen most of the animated Disney canon, the best of Pixar, the best of Ghibli, and so many other animated films, but not a one of them have continued to overpower and move me the way Pinocchio (1940) has. Ever since I first saw it at age 16, it has been my favorite animated feature. The animation is breathtaking. It's leagues ahead of what was achieved in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and still leagues ahead of most animated features made since.It's pure hand-drawn magic, almost impossible to surpass. (Pixar claimed Ratatouille (2007) surpassed it, but CG and traditional animation are two mediums too different to compare in my opinion. It's like comparing paintings and photography.) Every time I watch the film, I always notice some nuance or item in the background. The story is toned down and altered from the original novel, but what remains in this film is so good that I do not care. In fact, I think some of the changes were more effective, such as making the titular character more appealing. He is simply naive and thoughtless, not malicious. Pinocchio isn't the only one to develop either: after several viewings, I noticed that the initially irresponsible Jiminy and Geppetto also go through their own character arcs. Though The Black Cauldron (1985) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) are considered dark, they barely hold a candle to the frightening world of this film. As wicked as the Horned King and Frollo were, they got their comeuppance and did not live to see the end of their respective films. Not so in Pinocchio: the villains are not defeated, they will get to keep tricking, exploiting, murdering, and enslaving people long after the credits stop rolling. The heroes cannot defeat them. The best they can hope for is that they can escape with their lives and learn from the mistake. The movie is plainly stating that there is no way to rid the world of evil, rather bleak for a Disney film. (Thank God they never made a horrid DTV sequel where the boys on Pleasure Island are rescued, as it would undermine the horror of the original movie.) However, Pinocchio is at its heart an uplifting story. Though the world is cruel and evil cannot be vanquished, goodness and love still exist. The American Film Institute did right for once by putting it on their Most Inspiring Movies list. Pinocchio is a lovely experience, not only a great Disney film or a great animated film, but one of the greatest pictures ever made PERIOD. Don't miss out.

    After releasing a film that took years to make and not knowing what the end result would be, many wondered what Walt Disney could possibly create next after his 1st full-length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Well, Walt Disney started lining up more possible projects including more full-length animated features. He was considering many options for his second animated feature including Bambi (1942), Dumbo (1941), Alice in Wonderland (1951), Peter Pan (1953), and even Fantasia (1940), all of which would eventually become animated features later. Then, due to difficulties figuring out how to adapt the other stories to the big screen, Walt Disney finally decided for his 2nd animated feature to be Pinocchio (1940). This tale starts with a lonely wood carver named Gepetto finishing up on his newest marionette that he has called Pinocchio. He tells his two animal companions, a cat named Figaro and a fish named Cleo, that he wishes that Pinocchio was a real boy. One night, he gets his wish as a magical blue fairy brings this puppet to life. He isn't a real boy yet, but if he is able to prove his bravery, honesty and kindness, he will be one someday. Pinocchio is given a sidekick named Jiminy Cricket who will help him decide what's right or wrong and help make Gepetto proud. Now, Pinocchio is put to the test as he goes on many accidental misadventures such as becoming an actor, going to an island where you're allowed to do whatever you want (with a permanent price to pay, of course), and chasing down a monstrous whale. As was the case with Walt Disney's previous picture Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio (1940) is exceptionally well animated. The backgrounds are so painstakingly well detailed that you practically notice something new in the backgrounds every time you watch it. In terms of its visuals, it really pushes the envelope for what animated films can do with lighting, color, and other unique visual techniques. The music by Leigh Harline, Ned Washington, and Paul Smith is also worth commenting on. I think it's safe to say that all of us know how immortal and timeless the song "When You Wish Upon a Star" is. I think that playing this song during the opening credits was genius, since it's the best way to draw the audience's attention at the start of a film like this which is surprisingly darker than you might remember it being. Why do I say that Pinocchio is a slightly darker film than most people will remember it being? Because of the way the story convinces us how wrong it is to do whatever Pinocchio is manipulated into doing. For example, when Pinocchio tells a lie about why he didn't go to school to the blue fairy, his nose keeps on growing whenever he tells lie after lie. Another noteworthy example is when Pinocchio is manipulated into going to Pleasure Island where young boys smoke cigars, drink beer, play pool and other frowned upon activities for kids to be doing. After too much time there, the kids transform into donkeys that will be taken to work at the salt mines. The reasons why they somehow turn into donkeys are surreal to say the least, but let's just say this scene will scare off kids from smoking and drinkingÂ….at least for a while. I could have done without a few scenes at the beginning, which were solely devoted to showing off the sound effects and the details in Gepetto's workshop as opposed to continue telling the story. In short, Pinocchio gets off to a little bit of a slow start. I also thought that the ending to this film was sort of ripping off the ending from Snow White in a way that was less credible. If you've seen the ending to this film already, you'll know what plot device was used during that scene that I personally don't care for. On top of that, there were certain little details in the climax that didn't add up for me. Alright, guys. Prepare to detest me for what I'm about to say. I have to agree with Internet video film critic Doug Walker (of the Nostalgia Critic fame) when he said that Jiminy Cricket does not hold up well as a character. But I have my own reasons why I dislike this character. While I do agree with Doug that his sense of humor doesn't hold up well, the main reason I don't care for Jiminy Cricket any more is because he's way too careless, gives up too easily, and thinks he's right about everything. There are more than a few scenes that show just how blatantly inconsistent his character is, and how he switches back and forth between a sidekick with good intentions to a creature whose remarks are unjustified. In the end, I felt like Jiminy was way too inconsistent to the point where his character just didn't work. Ultimately, what still keeps Pinocchio a good Disney movie more than 70 years after its initial release is the animation, the music, and the way it reinforces the main morals of its story onto its young audience. Even though Jiminy Cricket's somewhat good intentions with his character backfired on me, I still liked Pinocchio himself. I admired how curious he was about the world around him, how positive his attitude was, and how clueless he was about what's good and what's bad. In other words, he felt like a real kid personality wise. This aspect and the ones I've mentioned before are good enough reasons why Pinocchio is a film that any Disney fans should take a look at.

    Released over two years after Snow White, Pinocchio is not only as good as Disney's first, but it surpasses it. The story is about a marionette puppet that comes to life after the Fairy grants his father Gepetto's wish for Pinocchip to become a real boy. He has to prove the Fairy that he can be a real boy by being honest and selfless The characters in this film are less one-dimensional than the characters in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Pinocchio is an actual boy; he makes mistakes, he lies sometimes, and he sometimes wants to be bad, but he still wants to overall do the right thing. Jiminy Cricket is an alright sidekick, and Gepetto is such a happy, joyful character. You could tell Pinocchio brought him a lot of happiness. The cat, fish, and fairy are all enjoyable, delightful characters. The animation has improved as well since Snow White, and the filler scenes are reduced. The plot is well paced, and it is so funny when Pinocchio's nose grows every time he lies. The story is not very close to the original book, since the book is very dark and twisted, but no one expects an exact adaption to the book. The songs are very great. It's signature song "When You Wish Upon a Star" is also Disney's anthem. The song "I've Got No Strings" is pretty good as well. This film can appeal to both children and adults, and is very strong. It is definitely one of Disney's best films. Perfect entertainment.

    "I've got no strings to hold me..." Oops, sorry, I was having a moment there. As one of Disney's earliest films, the artistry here is so incredible you'd assume he had been churning them out for years. How could you not love the titular marionette and his faithful insect companion? Who wouldn't be scared stiff of the naughty boys turning into Jackasses on Pleasure Island? Why would you not be wowed at the ginormus whale Monstro chasing our heroes in a spectacular sequence? And anybody who doesn't find their foot tapping to the lovely songs (As ably demonstrated by my dulcet tones) officially has no soul. It's just a beautiful movie that will be appreciated for generations to come, and anyone who thinks it's just for kids would do well to pay attention to the lessons about honesty and loyalty contained within. Of course it's a lot of fun as well... Notice the hilarious clocks in Geppetto's cottage at the start. And of course there's the music... Oh dear, it's set me off again... "When you wish upon a staarr...". 8/10

    I know a 7.6 rating on IMDb is pretty darn good, but Pinocchio deserves better than this. I've owned the VHS of Pinocchio for years as a kid, but always perceived it as too dark and somber so I stuck to the more upbeat Disney films like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc. It was only last year that I stumbled upon a Blu ray copy, that I rediscovered it. I was shocked to see how much beauty and elegance this film possesses. Music - it's poignant and memorable, and rightfully won two academy awards for score and song. Animation - it's amazing how much we're overlooking when watching these films as kids. From Geppetto's workshop to the Italian village to Pleasure Island to the bottom of the ocean. The image is consistently rich in detail and the velvety texture applied to the backgrounds is extraordinary. Like Snow White, Fantasia and Bambi, "Pinocchio" makes extensive use of the multi plane camera, giving the picture consistent depth and realism. I urge everyone who owns a Blu ray player to buy a copy. It will blow you away. Characters - Pinocchio features some of the most appealing characters in Disney history. I think everyone will agree that most of them here have become iconic: Pinocchio, Jimini, Geppetto, the Blue Fairy, Honest John, Gideon, Stromboli & Monstro. The story of course is the heart of the movie and there is something very intimate and warm about it. A lonely elderly man wishing for his puppet to become a real boy and then the obstacles that follow. The whole atmosphere of the film is yet to be recaptured and probably never will, given that Disney films nowadays lean toward gimmicky fluff and 3D. Years after my first viewing of this film, I have finally come to appreciate the beauty of it. I wish it had happened earlier. But better later than never.

    Of course no matter what your age, I'm sure you've at least heard of Disney's classic movie. It was the second in a long string of excellent classics created by Walt Disney and his wonderful team. In this movie, a toy and clock maker name Geppetto, along with his two pets, a cat named Pedro and a fish named Cleo, brings this classic to life! Pedro and Cleo both have personalities without even saying a word. Then after Geppetto creates a puppet, he wishes for the puppet to become real. Our story teller is a cricket named Jimminy. He becomes a classic part of Walt Disney and will appear in other Disney movies throughout the years. We also meet a boy named Lampwick who assures Pinocchio that it would be more fun to be bad then good. He plays pool, smokes cigars, and drinks beer (for those parents who are sensitive about that stuff, you might want to watch this part with your kids so you can discuss the good vs. evil). Most of the animals in this movie have personalities. I've already mentioned the cricket, cat, and fish. The whale had a booming personality. Famous songs were in this movie as well. Of course, we've all heard "When you wish upon a star," which becomes the theme song for Disney movies, even today. "Little Wooden Head," "Give a Little Whistle," and "I've Got No Strings" are also all great songs. Of course, the action in the ocean scene is a must see for sure! I've already mentioned the sins of Lampwick, but other things parents may want to be aware of in this classic are: Saloon dancing puppets with obvious cleavage and one scene where Jimminy Cricket touches the backside of a statue and makes a big deal out of it.

    Pinocchio is the classic tale of a lonely man without a child that builds himself a wooden puppet. The puppet comes alive but wishes to be a real boy. A lot of Disney's best work still holds up today. Pinocchio is an episodic but delightfully twisted film. It's basically a fable on how to choose between right from wrong but who cares when it has some scenes worthy of the best horror films. Pleasure Island is a twisted and terrifying place. The donkey's screaming is very disturbing, as is Lampwick's. He may be a jackass but he is still a little boy with a mother. Like many fairy tales movies adapted from books it's a bit jumpy, but at least this keeps the pace going.The morals are surprisingly strong and hold up today. The kids on Pleasure Island are a lot like actual children today, with drinking and smoking. It also shows a strong, single father relationship.

    What I like about Pinocchio is the beautiful animation. I also liked the voice acting in this film. Now here comes the problem with the film. The problem I find with the film is that certain things don't make any sense. For Example, Pinocchio developing a plan to get out of the whale "Monstro." How did he develop a plan to get out of the whale? In the beginning of the film, Pinocchio doesn't even know what a fire is! After Geppetto puts off the fire in Pinocchio's finger, he doesn't even tell Pinocchio about the danger of the fire. Geppetto plans to send Pinocchio to school next morning. And Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school "alone." Pinocchio doesn't even go to the first day of school. But he knows how to swim and he knows more than Geppetto about escaping out of whale's mouth. People might say "Come on. Don't take it seriously. Its just an animated film." But the purpose of story like Pinocchio is to convey a message like "Pinocchio can become a real boy if he proves himself "brave, truthful, and unselfish". So a certain degree of logic should be applied to a story like Pinocchio. Like learning things through his experiences. But Walt Disney focused on unimportant things like "Jiminy Cricket getting irritated by the sounds of the clocks, hour glass, and snoring." This doesn't add anything to the story. Instead Walt Disney and animators should have at least "implied" that Pinocchio learned about fire and learned about swimming before Geppetto took Pinocchio to school. But instead, Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school all by himself. But Pinocchio only became alive last night. Aside from these problems, it does have lots of interesting things in it. Characters are likable especially Pinocchio, Geppetto, Jiminy cricket, fairy, cat, fish, etc. I like Jiminy Cricket. Jiminy does have his limitations in helping. But he still "tries" his best in helping Pinocchio. Like I mentioned, the animation is great and I like the voice acting. But I feel that "certain" degree of logic should have applied to Pinocchio since the purpose of the story also has to do with conveying a message to the audience. Overall, I find the film enjoyable. 7 out of 10.

I have to agree with Internet video film critic Doug Walker (of the Nostalgia Critic fame) when he said that Jiminy Cricket does not hold up well as a character. But I have my own reasons why I dislike this character. While I do agree with Doug that his sense of humor doesn't hold up well, the main reason I don't care for Jiminy Cricket any more is because he's way too careless, gives up too easily, and thinks he's right about everything. There are more than a few scenes that show just how blatantly inconsistent his character is, and how he switches back and forth between a sidekick with good intentions to a creature whose remarks are unjustified. In the end, I felt like Jiminy was way too inconsistent to the point where his character just didn't work. Ultimately, what still keeps Pinocchio a good Disney movie more than 70 years after its initial release is the animation, the music, and the way it reinforces the main morals of its story onto its young audience. Even though Jiminy Cricket's somewhat good intentions with his character backfired on me, I still liked Pinocchio himself. I admired how curious he was about the world around him, how positive his attitude was, and how clueless he was about what's good and what's bad. In other words, he felt like a real kid personality wise. This aspect and the ones I've mentioned before are good enough reasons why Pinocchio is a film that any Disney fans should take a look at.

    Released over two years after Snow White, Pinocchio is not only as good as Disney's first, but it surpasses it. The story is about a marionette puppet that comes to life after the Fairy grants his father Gepetto's wish for Pinocchip to become a real boy. He has to prove the Fairy that he can be a real boy by being honest and selfless The characters in this film are less one-dimensional than the characters in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Pinocchio is an actual boy; he makes mistakes, he lies sometimes, and he sometimes wants to be bad, but he still wants to overall do the right thing. Jiminy Cricket is an alright sidekick, and Gepetto is such a happy, joyful character. You could tell Pinocchio brought him a lot of happiness. The cat, fish, and fairy are all enjoyable, delightful characters. The animation has improved as well since Snow White, and the filler scenes are reduced. The plot is well paced, and it is so funny when Pinocchio's nose grows every time he lies. The story is not very close to the original book, since the book is very dark and twisted, but no one expects an exact adaption to the book. The songs are very great. It's signature song "When You Wish Upon a Star" is also Disney's anthem. The song "I've Got No Strings" is pretty good as well. This film can appeal to both children and adults, and is very strong. It is definitely one of Disney's best films. Perfect entertainment.

    "I've got no strings to hold me..." Oops, sorry, I was having a moment there. As one of Disney's earliest films, the artistry here is so incredible you'd assume he had been churning them out for years. How could you not love the titular marionette and his faithful insect companion? Who wouldn't be scared stiff of the naughty boys turning into Jackasses on Pleasure Island? Why would you not be wowed at the ginormus whale Monstro chasing our heroes in a spectacular sequence? And anybody who doesn't find their foot tapping to the lovely songs (As ably demonstrated by my dulcet tones) officially has no soul. It's just a beautiful movie that will be appreciated for generations to come, and anyone who thinks it's just for kids would do well to pay attention to the lessons about honesty and loyalty contained within. Of course it's a lot of fun as well... Notice the hilarious clocks in Geppetto's cottage at the start. And of course there's the music... Oh dear, it's set me off again... "When you wish upon a staarr...". 8/10

    I know a 7.6 rating on IMDb is pretty darn good, but Pinocchio deserves better than this. I've owned the VHS of Pinocchio for years as a kid, but always perceived it as too dark and somber so I stuck to the more upbeat Disney films like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc. It was only last year that I stumbled upon a Blu ray copy, that I rediscovered it. I was shocked to see how much beauty and elegance this film possesses. Music - it's poignant and memorable, and rightfully won two academy awards for score and song. Animation - it's amazing how much we're overlooking when watching these films as kids. From Geppetto's workshop to the Italian village to Pleasure Island to the bottom of the ocean. The image is consistently rich in detail and the velvety texture applied to the backgrounds is extraordinary. Like Snow White, Fantasia and Bambi, "Pinocchio" makes extensive use of the multi plane camera, giving the picture consistent depth and realism. I urge everyone who owns a Blu ray player to buy a copy. It will blow you away. Characters - Pinocchio features some of the most appealing characters in Disney history. I think everyone will agree that most of them here have become iconic: Pinocchio, Jimini, Geppetto, the Blue Fairy, Honest John, Gideon, Stromboli & Monstro. The story of course is the heart of the movie and there is something very intimate and warm about it. A lonely elderly man wishing for his puppet to become a real boy and then the obstacles that follow. The whole atmosphere of the film is yet to be recaptured and probably never will, given that Disney films nowadays lean toward gimmicky fluff and 3D. Years after my first viewing of this film, I have finally come to appreciate the beauty of it. I wish it had happened earlier. But better later than never.

    Of course no matter what your age, I'm sure you've at least heard of Disney's classic movie. It was the second in a long string of excellent classics created by Walt Disney and his wonderful team. In this movie, a toy and clock maker name Geppetto, along with his two pets, a cat named Pedro and a fish named Cleo, brings this classic to life! Pedro and Cleo both have personalities without even saying a word. Then after Geppetto creates a puppet, he wishes for the puppet to become real. Our story teller is a cricket named Jimminy. He becomes a classic part of Walt Disney and will appear in other Disney movies throughout the years. We also meet a boy named Lampwick who assures Pinocchio that it would be more fun to be bad then good. He plays pool, smokes cigars, and drinks beer (for those parents who are sensitive about that stuff, you might want to watch this part with your kids so you can discuss the good vs. evil). Most of the animals in this movie have personalities. I've already mentioned the cricket, cat, and fish. The whale had a booming personality. Famous songs were in this movie as well. Of course, we've all heard "When you wish upon a star," which becomes the theme song for Disney movies, even today. "Little Wooden Head," "Give a Little Whistle," and "I've Got No Strings" are also all great songs. Of course, the action in the ocean scene is a must see for sure! I've already mentioned the sins of Lampwick, but other things parents may want to be aware of in this classic are: Saloon dancing puppets with obvious cleavage and one scene where Jimminy Cricket touches the backside of a statue and makes a big deal out of it.

    Pinocchio is the classic tale of a lonely man without a child that builds himself a wooden puppet. The puppet comes alive but wishes to be a real boy. A lot of Disney's best work still holds up today. Pinocchio is an episodic but delightfully twisted film. It's basically a fable on how to choose between right from wrong but who cares when it has some scenes worthy of the best horror films. Pleasure Island is a twisted and terrifying place. The donkey's screaming is very disturbing, as is Lampwick's. He may be a jackass but he is still a little boy with a mother. Like many fairy tales movies adapted from books it's a bit jumpy, but at least this keeps the pace going.The morals are surprisingly strong and hold up today. The kids on Pleasure Island are a lot like actual children today, with drinking and smoking. It also shows a strong, single father relationship.

    What I like about Pinocchio is the beautiful animation. I also liked the voice acting in this film. Now here comes the problem with the film. The problem I find with the film is that certain things don't make any sense. For Example, Pinocchio developing a plan to get out of the whale "Monstro." How did he develop a plan to get out of the whale? In the beginning of the film, Pinocchio doesn't even know what a fire is! After Geppetto puts off the fire in Pinocchio's finger, he doesn't even tell Pinocchio about the danger of the fire. Geppetto plans to send Pinocchio to school next morning. And Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school "alone." Pinocchio doesn't even go to the first day of school. But he knows how to swim and he knows more than Geppetto about escaping out of whale's mouth. People might say "Come on. Don't take it seriously. Its just an animated film." But the purpose of story like Pinocchio is to convey a message like "Pinocchio can become a real boy if he proves himself "brave, truthful, and unselfish". So a certain degree of logic should be applied to a story like Pinocchio. Like learning things through his experiences. But Walt Disney focused on unimportant things like "Jiminy Cricket getting irritated by the sounds of the clocks, hour glass, and snoring." This doesn't add anything to the story. Instead Walt Disney and animators should have at least "implied" that Pinocchio learned about fire and learned about swimming before Geppetto took Pinocchio to school. But instead, Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school all by himself. But Pinocchio only became alive last night. Aside from these problems, it does have lots of interesting things in it. Characters are likable especially Pinocchio, Geppetto, Jiminy cricket, fairy, cat, fish, etc. I like Jiminy Cricket. Jiminy does have his limitations in helping. But he still "tries" his best in helping Pinocchio. Like I mentioned, the animation is great and I like the voice acting. But I feel that "certain" degree of logic should have applied to Pinocchio since the purpose of the story also has to do with conveying a message to the audience. Overall, I find the film enjoyable. 7 out of 10.

    Pinocchio is a breathtaking movie. It is one of the most beautiful animated movies. The story is engaging, the settings are magical, the characters are great, it simply embraces you with everything. Mixing its "dark" elements, and its "creepy" tone, with the "magical" atmosphere and the "uniqueness" of the movie, it all works out amazingly, and it makes the movie so authentic. It is hard to think Pinocchio was released just one year after Snow White, and that the production started just 3 years after Snow White's started. The animation is just wonderful, and the movie is not far away from being perfect. It is an engrossing, timeless movie. This is undoubtedly Disney Masterpiece. Its high quality proves that Pinocchio is one of the best animated movies...

    I have seen most of the animated Disney canon, the best of Pixar, the best of Ghibli, and so many other animated films, but not a one of them have continued to overpower and move me the way Pinocchio (1940) has. Ever since I first saw it at age 16, it has been my favorite animated feature. The animation is breathtaking. It's leagues ahead of what was achieved in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and still leagues ahead of most animated features made since.It's pure hand-drawn magic, almost impossible to surpass. (Pixar claimed Ratatouille (2007) surpassed it, but CG and traditional animation are two mediums too different to compare in my opinion. It's like comparing paintings and photography.) Every time I watch the film, I always notice some nuance or item in the background. The story is toned down and altered from the original novel, but what remains in this film is so good that I do not care. In fact, I think some of the changes were more effective, such as making the titular character more appealing. He is simply naive and thoughtless, not malicious. Pinocchio isn't the only one to develop either: after several viewings, I noticed that the initially irresponsible Jiminy and Geppetto also go through their own character arcs. Though The Black Cauldron (1985) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) are considered dark, they barely hold a candle to the frightening world of this film. As wicked as the Horned King and Frollo were, they got their comeuppance and did not live to see the end of their respective films. Not so in Pinocchio: the villains are not defeated, they will get to keep tricking, exploiting, murdering, and enslaving people long after the credits stop rolling. The heroes cannot defeat them. The best they can hope for is that they can escape with their lives and learn from the mistake. The movie is plainly stating that there is no way to rid the world of evil, rather bleak for a Disney film. (Thank God they never made a horrid DTV sequel where the boys on Pleasure Island are rescued, as it would undermine the horror of the original movie.) However, Pinocchio is at its heart an uplifting story. Though the world is cruel and evil cannot be vanquished, goodness and love still exist. The American Film Institute did right for once by putting it on their Most Inspiring Movies list. Pinocchio is a lovely experience, not only a great Disney film or a great animated film, but one of the greatest pictures ever made PERIOD. Don't miss out.

    After releasing a film that took years to make and not knowing what the end result would be, many wondered what Walt Disney could possibly create next after his 1st full-length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Well, Walt Disney started lining up more possible projects including more full-length animated features. He was considering many options for his second animated feature including Bambi (1942), Dumbo (1941), Alice in Wonderland (1951), Peter Pan (1953), and even Fantasia (1940), all of which would eventually become animated features later. Then, due to difficulties figuring out how to adapt the other stories to the big screen, Walt Disney finally decided for his 2nd animated feature to be Pinocchio (1940). This tale starts with a lonely wood carver named Gepetto finishing up on his newest marionette that he has called Pinocchio. He tells his two animal companions, a cat named Figaro and a fish named Cleo, that he wishes that Pinocchio was a real boy. One night, he gets his wish as a magical blue fairy brings this puppet to life. He isn't a real boy yet, but if he is able to prove his bravery, honesty and kindness, he will be one someday. Pinocchio is given a sidekick named Jiminy Cricket who will help him decide what's right or wrong and help make Gepetto proud. Now, Pinocchio is put to the test as he goes on many accidental misadventures such as becoming an actor, going to an island where you're allowed to do whatever you want (with a permanent price to pay, of course), and chasing down a monstrous whale. As was the case with Walt Disney's previous picture Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio (1940) is exceptionally well animated. The backgrounds are so painstakingly well detailed that you practically notice something new in the backgrounds every time you watch it. In terms of its visuals, it really pushes the envelope for what animated films can do with lighting, color, and other unique visual techniques. The music by Leigh Harline, Ned Washington, and Paul Smith is also worth commenting on. I think it's safe to say that all of us know how immortal and timeless the song "When You Wish Upon a Star" is. I think that playing this song during the opening credits was genius, since it's the best way to draw the audience's attention at the start of a film like this which is surprisingly darker than you might remember it being. Why do I say that Pinocchio is a slightly darker film than most people will remember it being? Because of the way the story convinces us how wrong it is to do whatever Pinocchio is manipulated into doing. For example, when Pinocchio tells a lie about why he didn't go to school to the blue fairy, his nose keeps on growing whenever he tells lie after lie. Another noteworthy example is when Pinocchio is manipulated into going to Pleasure Island where young boys smoke cigars, drink beer, play pool and other frowned upon activities for kids to be doing. After too much time there, the kids transform into donkeys that will be taken to work at the salt mines. The reasons why they somehow turn into donkeys are surreal to say the least, but let's just say this scene will scare off kids from smoking and drinkingÂ….at least for a while. I could have done without a few scenes at the beginning, which were solely devoted to showing off the sound effects and the details in Gepetto's workshop as opposed to continue telling the story. In short, Pinocchio gets off to a little bit of a slow start. I also thought that the ending to this film was sort of ripping off the ending from Snow White in a way that was less credible. If you've seen the ending to this film already, you'll know what plot device was used during that scene that I personally don't care for. On top of that, there were certain little details in the climax that didn't add up for me. Alright, guys. Prepare to detest me for what I'm about to say. I have to agree with Internet video film critic Doug Walker (of the Nostalgia Critic fame) when he said that Jiminy Cricket does not hold up well as a character. But I have my own reasons why I dislike this character. While I do agree with Doug that his sense of humor doesn't hold up well, the main reason I don't care for Jiminy Cricket any more is because he's way too careless, gives up too easily, and thinks he's right about everything. There are more than a few scenes that show just how blatantly inconsistent his character is, and how he switches back and forth between a sidekick with good intentions to a creature whose remarks are unjustified. In the end, I felt like Jiminy was way too inconsistent to the point where his character just didn't work. Ultimately, what still keeps Pinocchio a good Disney movie more than 70 years after its initial release is the animation, the music, and the way it reinforces the main morals of its story onto its young audience.

But the purpose of story like Pinocchio is to convey a message like "Pinocchio can become a real boy if he proves himself "brave, truthful, and unselfish". So a certain degree of logic should be applied to a story like Pinocchio. Like learning things through his experiences. But Walt Disney focused on unimportant things like "Jiminy Cricket getting irritated by the sounds of the clocks, hour glass, and snoring." This doesn't add anything to the story. Instead Walt Disney and animators should have at least "implied" that Pinocchio learned about fire and learned about swimming before Geppetto took Pinocchio to school. But instead, Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school all by himself. But Pinocchio only became alive last night. Aside from these problems, it does have lots of interesting things in it. Characters are likable especially Pinocchio, Geppetto, Jiminy cricket, fairy, cat, fish, etc. I like Jiminy Cricket. Jiminy does have his limitations in helping. But he still "tries" his best in helping Pinocchio. Like I mentioned, the animation is great and I like the voice acting. But I feel that "certain" degree of logic should have applied to Pinocchio since the purpose of the story also has to do with conveying a message to the audience. Overall, I find the film enjoyable. 7 out of 10.

    Pinocchio is a breathtaking movie. It is one of the most beautiful animated movies. The story is engaging, the settings are magical, the characters are great, it simply embraces you with everything. Mixing its "dark" elements, and its "creepy" tone, with the "magical" atmosphere and the "uniqueness" of the movie, it all works out amazingly, and it makes the movie so authentic. It is hard to think Pinocchio was released just one year after Snow White, and that the production started just 3 years after Snow White's started. The animation is just wonderful, and the movie is not far away from being perfect. It is an engrossing, timeless movie. This is undoubtedly Disney Masterpiece. Its high quality proves that Pinocchio is one of the best animated movies...

    I have seen most of the animated Disney canon, the best of Pixar, the best of Ghibli, and so many other animated films, but not a one of them have continued to overpower and move me the way Pinocchio (1940) has. Ever since I first saw it at age 16, it has been my favorite animated feature. The animation is breathtaking. It's leagues ahead of what was achieved in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and still leagues ahead of most animated features made since.It's pure hand-drawn magic, almost impossible to surpass. (Pixar claimed Ratatouille (2007) surpassed it, but CG and traditional animation are two mediums too different to compare in my opinion. It's like comparing paintings and photography.) Every time I watch the film, I always notice some nuance or item in the background. The story is toned down and altered from the original novel, but what remains in this film is so good that I do not care. In fact, I think some of the changes were more effective, such as making the titular character more appealing. He is simply naive and thoughtless, not malicious. Pinocchio isn't the only one to develop either: after several viewings, I noticed that the initially irresponsible Jiminy and Geppetto also go through their own character arcs. Though The Black Cauldron (1985) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) are considered dark, they barely hold a candle to the frightening world of this film. As wicked as the Horned King and Frollo were, they got their comeuppance and did not live to see the end of their respective films. Not so in Pinocchio: the villains are not defeated, they will get to keep tricking, exploiting, murdering, and enslaving people long after the credits stop rolling. The heroes cannot defeat them. The best they can hope for is that they can escape with their lives and learn from the mistake. The movie is plainly stating that there is no way to rid the world of evil, rather bleak for a Disney film. (Thank God they never made a horrid DTV sequel where the boys on Pleasure Island are rescued, as it would undermine the horror of the original movie.) However, Pinocchio is at its heart an uplifting story. Though the world is cruel and evil cannot be vanquished, goodness and love still exist. The American Film Institute did right for once by putting it on their Most Inspiring Movies list. Pinocchio is a lovely experience, not only a great Disney film or a great animated film, but one of the greatest pictures ever made PERIOD. Don't miss out.

    After releasing a film that took years to make and not knowing what the end result would be, many wondered what Walt Disney could possibly create next after his 1st full-length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Well, Walt Disney started lining up more possible projects including more full-length animated features. He was considering many options for his second animated feature including Bambi (1942), Dumbo (1941), Alice in Wonderland (1951), Peter Pan (1953), and even Fantasia (1940), all of which would eventually become animated features later. Then, due to difficulties figuring out how to adapt the other stories to the big screen, Walt Disney finally decided for his 2nd animated feature to be Pinocchio (1940). This tale starts with a lonely wood carver named Gepetto finishing up on his newest marionette that he has called Pinocchio. He tells his two animal companions, a cat named Figaro and a fish named Cleo, that he wishes that Pinocchio was a real boy. One night, he gets his wish as a magical blue fairy brings this puppet to life. He isn't a real boy yet, but if he is able to prove his bravery, honesty and kindness, he will be one someday. Pinocchio is given a sidekick named Jiminy Cricket who will help him decide what's right or wrong and help make Gepetto proud. Now, Pinocchio is put to the test as he goes on many accidental misadventures such as becoming an actor, going to an island where you're allowed to do whatever you want (with a permanent price to pay, of course), and chasing down a monstrous whale. As was the case with Walt Disney's previous picture Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio (1940) is exceptionally well animated. The backgrounds are so painstakingly well detailed that you practically notice something new in the backgrounds every time you watch it. In terms of its visuals, it really pushes the envelope for what animated films can do with lighting, color, and other unique visual techniques. The music by Leigh Harline, Ned Washington, and Paul Smith is also worth commenting on. I think it's safe to say that all of us know how immortal and timeless the song "When You Wish Upon a Star" is. I think that playing this song during the opening credits was genius, since it's the best way to draw the audience's attention at the start of a film like this which is surprisingly darker than you might remember it being. Why do I say that Pinocchio is a slightly darker film than most people will remember it being? Because of the way the story convinces us how wrong it is to do whatever Pinocchio is manipulated into doing. For example, when Pinocchio tells a lie about why he didn't go to school to the blue fairy, his nose keeps on growing whenever he tells lie after lie. Another noteworthy example is when Pinocchio is manipulated into going to Pleasure Island where young boys smoke cigars, drink beer, play pool and other frowned upon activities for kids to be doing. After too much time there, the kids transform into donkeys that will be taken to work at the salt mines. The reasons why they somehow turn into donkeys are surreal to say the least, but let's just say this scene will scare off kids from smoking and drinkingÂ….at least for a while. I could have done without a few scenes at the beginning, which were solely devoted to showing off the sound effects and the details in Gepetto's workshop as opposed to continue telling the story. In short, Pinocchio gets off to a little bit of a slow start. I also thought that the ending to this film was sort of ripping off the ending from Snow White in a way that was less credible. If you've seen the ending to this film already, you'll know what plot device was used during that scene that I personally don't care for. On top of that, there were certain little details in the climax that didn't add up for me. Alright, guys. Prepare to detest me for what I'm about to say. I have to agree with Internet video film critic Doug Walker (of the Nostalgia Critic fame) when he said that Jiminy Cricket does not hold up well as a character. But I have my own reasons why I dislike this character. While I do agree with Doug that his sense of humor doesn't hold up well, the main reason I don't care for Jiminy Cricket any more is because he's way too careless, gives up too easily, and thinks he's right about everything. There are more than a few scenes that show just how blatantly inconsistent his character is, and how he switches back and forth between a sidekick with good intentions to a creature whose remarks are unjustified. In the end, I felt like Jiminy was way too inconsistent to the point where his character just didn't work. Ultimately, what still keeps Pinocchio a good Disney movie more than 70 years after its initial release is the animation, the music, and the way it reinforces the main morals of its story onto its young audience. Even though Jiminy Cricket's somewhat good intentions with his character backfired on me, I still liked Pinocchio himself. I admired how curious he was about the world around him, how positive his attitude was, and how clueless he was about what's good and what's bad. In other words, he felt like a real kid personality wise. This aspect and the ones I've mentioned before are good enough reasons why Pinocchio is a film that any Disney fans should take a look at.

    Released over two years after Snow White, Pinocchio is not only as good as Disney's first, but it surpasses it. The story is about a marionette puppet that comes to life after the Fairy grants his father Gepetto's wish for Pinocchip to become a real boy. He has to prove the Fairy that he can be a real boy by being honest and selfless The characters in this film are less one-dimensional than the characters in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Pinocchio is an actual boy; he makes mistakes, he lies sometimes, and he sometimes wants to be bad, but he still wants to overall do the right thing. Jiminy Cricket is an alright sidekick, and Gepetto is such a happy, joyful character. You could tell Pinocchio brought him a lot of happiness. The cat, fish, and fairy are all enjoyable, delightful characters. The animation has improved as well since Snow White, and the filler scenes are reduced. The plot is well paced, and it is so funny when Pinocchio's nose grows every time he lies. The story is not very close to the original book, since the book is very dark and twisted, but no one expects an exact adaption to the book. The songs are very great. It's signature song "When You Wish Upon a Star" is also Disney's anthem. The song "I've Got No Strings" is pretty good as well. This film can appeal to both children and adults, and is very strong. It is definitely one of Disney's best films. Perfect entertainment.

    "I've got no strings to hold me..." Oops, sorry, I was having a moment there. As one of Disney's earliest films, the artistry here is so incredible you'd assume he had been churning them out for years. How could you not love the titular marionette and his faithful insect companion? Who wouldn't be scared stiff of the naughty boys turning into Jackasses on Pleasure Island? Why would you not be wowed at the ginormus whale Monstro chasing our heroes in a spectacular sequence? And anybody who doesn't find their foot tapping to the lovely songs (As ably demonstrated by my dulcet tones) officially has no soul. It's just a beautiful movie that will be appreciated for generations to come, and anyone who thinks it's just for kids would do well to pay attention to the lessons about honesty and loyalty contained within. Of course it's a lot of fun as well... Notice the hilarious clocks in Geppetto's cottage at the start. And of course there's the music... Oh dear, it's set me off again... "When you wish upon a staarr...". 8/10

    I know a 7.6 rating on IMDb is pretty darn good, but Pinocchio deserves better than this. I've owned the VHS of Pinocchio for years as a kid, but always perceived it as too dark and somber so I stuck to the more upbeat Disney films like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc. It was only last year that I stumbled upon a Blu ray copy, that I rediscovered it. I was shocked to see how much beauty and elegance this film possesses. Music - it's poignant and memorable, and rightfully won two academy awards for score and song. Animation - it's amazing how much we're overlooking when watching these films as kids. From Geppetto's workshop to the Italian village to Pleasure Island to the bottom of the ocean. The image is consistently rich in detail and the velvety texture applied to the backgrounds is extraordinary. Like Snow White, Fantasia and Bambi, "Pinocchio" makes extensive use of the multi plane camera, giving the picture consistent depth and realism. I urge everyone who owns a Blu ray player to buy a copy. It will blow you away. Characters - Pinocchio features some of the most appealing characters in Disney history. I think everyone will agree that most of them here have become iconic: Pinocchio, Jimini, Geppetto, the Blue Fairy, Honest John, Gideon, Stromboli & Monstro. The story of course is the heart of the movie and there is something very intimate and warm about it. A lonely elderly man wishing for his puppet to become a real boy and then the obstacles that follow. The whole atmosphere of the film is yet to be recaptured and probably never will, given that Disney films nowadays lean toward gimmicky fluff and 3D. Years after my first viewing of this film, I have finally come to appreciate the beauty of it. I wish it had happened earlier. But better later than never.

    Of course no matter what your age, I'm sure you've at least heard of Disney's classic movie. It was the second in a long string of excellent classics created by Walt Disney and his wonderful team. In this movie, a toy and clock maker name Geppetto, along with his two pets, a cat named Pedro and a fish named Cleo, brings this classic to life! Pedro and Cleo both have personalities without even saying a word. Then after Geppetto creates a puppet, he wishes for the puppet to become real. Our story teller is a cricket named Jimminy. He becomes a classic part of Walt Disney and will appear in other Disney movies throughout the years. We also meet a boy named Lampwick who assures Pinocchio that it would be more fun to be bad then good. He plays pool, smokes cigars, and drinks beer (for those parents who are sensitive about that stuff, you might want to watch this part with your kids so you can discuss the good vs. evil). Most of the animals in this movie have personalities. I've already mentioned the cricket, cat, and fish. The whale had a booming personality. Famous songs were in this movie as well. Of course, we've all heard "When you wish upon a star," which becomes the theme song for Disney movies, even today. "Little Wooden Head," "Give a Little Whistle," and "I've Got No Strings" are also all great songs. Of course, the action in the ocean scene is a must see for sure! I've already mentioned the sins of Lampwick, but other things parents may want to be aware of in this classic are: Saloon dancing puppets with obvious cleavage and one scene where Jimminy Cricket touches the backside of a statue and makes a big deal out of it.

    Pinocchio is the classic tale of a lonely man without a child that builds himself a wooden puppet. The puppet comes alive but wishes to be a real boy. A lot of Disney's best work still holds up today. Pinocchio is an episodic but delightfully twisted film. It's basically a fable on how to choose between right from wrong but who cares when it has some scenes worthy of the best horror films. Pleasure Island is a twisted and terrifying place. The donkey's screaming is very disturbing, as is Lampwick's. He may be a jackass but he is still a little boy with a mother. Like many fairy tales movies adapted from books it's a bit jumpy, but at least this keeps the pace going.The morals are surprisingly strong and hold up today. The kids on Pleasure Island are a lot like actual children today, with drinking and smoking. It also shows a strong, single father relationship.

    What I like about Pinocchio is the beautiful animation. I also liked the voice acting in this film. Now here comes the problem with the film. The problem I find with the film is that certain things don't make any sense. For Example, Pinocchio developing a plan to get out of the whale "Monstro." How did he develop a plan to get out of the whale? In the beginning of the film, Pinocchio doesn't even know what a fire is! After Geppetto puts off the fire in Pinocchio's finger, he doesn't even tell Pinocchio about the danger of the fire. Geppetto plans to send Pinocchio to school next morning. And Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school "alone." Pinocchio doesn't even go to the first day of school. But he knows how to swim and he knows more than Geppetto about escaping out of whale's mouth. People might say "Come on. Don't take it seriously. Its just an animated film." But the purpose of story like Pinocchio is to convey a message like "Pinocchio can become a real boy if he proves himself "brave, truthful, and unselfish". So a certain degree of logic should be applied to a story like Pinocchio. Like learning things through his experiences. But Walt Disney focused on unimportant things like "Jiminy Cricket getting irritated by the sounds of the clocks, hour glass, and snoring." This doesn't add anything to the story. Instead Walt Disney and animators should have at least "implied" that Pinocchio learned about fire and learned about swimming before Geppetto took Pinocchio to school. But instead, Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school all by himself. But Pinocchio only became alive last night. Aside from these problems, it does have lots of interesting things in it. Characters are likable especially Pinocchio, Geppetto, Jiminy cricket, fairy, cat, fish, etc. I like Jiminy Cricket. Jiminy does have his limitations in helping. But he still "tries" his best in helping Pinocchio. Like I mentioned, the animation is great and I like the voice acting. But I feel that "certain" degree of logic should have applied to Pinocchio since the purpose of the story also has to do with conveying a message to the audience. Overall, I find the film enjoyable. 7 out of 10.

Ultimately, what still keeps Pinocchio a good Disney movie more than 70 years after its initial release is the animation, the music, and the way it reinforces the main morals of its story onto its young audience. Even though Jiminy Cricket's somewhat good intentions with his character backfired on me, I still liked Pinocchio himself. I admired how curious he was about the world around him, how positive his attitude was, and how clueless he was about what's good and what's bad. In other words, he felt like a real kid personality wise. This aspect and the ones I've mentioned before are good enough reasons why Pinocchio is a film that any Disney fans should take a look at.

    Released over two years after Snow White, Pinocchio is not only as good as Disney's first, but it surpasses it. The story is about a marionette puppet that comes to life after the Fairy grants his father Gepetto's wish for Pinocchip to become a real boy. He has to prove the Fairy that he can be a real boy by being honest and selfless The characters in this film are less one-dimensional than the characters in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Pinocchio is an actual boy; he makes mistakes, he lies sometimes, and he sometimes wants to be bad, but he still wants to overall do the right thing. Jiminy Cricket is an alright sidekick, and Gepetto is such a happy, joyful character. You could tell Pinocchio brought him a lot of happiness. The cat, fish, and fairy are all enjoyable, delightful characters. The animation has improved as well since Snow White, and the filler scenes are reduced. The plot is well paced, and it is so funny when Pinocchio's nose grows every time he lies. The story is not very close to the original book, since the book is very dark and twisted, but no one expects an exact adaption to the book. The songs are very great. It's signature song "When You Wish Upon a Star" is also Disney's anthem. The song "I've Got No Strings" is pretty good as well. This film can appeal to both children and adults, and is very strong. It is definitely one of Disney's best films. Perfect entertainment.

    "I've got no strings to hold me..." Oops, sorry, I was having a moment there. As one of Disney's earliest films, the artistry here is so incredible you'd assume he had been churning them out for years. How could you not love the titular marionette and his faithful insect companion? Who wouldn't be scared stiff of the naughty boys turning into Jackasses on Pleasure Island? Why would you not be wowed at the ginormus whale Monstro chasing our heroes in a spectacular sequence? And anybody who doesn't find their foot tapping to the lovely songs (As ably demonstrated by my dulcet tones) officially has no soul. It's just a beautiful movie that will be appreciated for generations to come, and anyone who thinks it's just for kids would do well to pay attention to the lessons about honesty and loyalty contained within. Of course it's a lot of fun as well... Notice the hilarious clocks in Geppetto's cottage at the start. And of course there's the music... Oh dear, it's set me off again... "When you wish upon a staarr...". 8/10

    I know a 7.6 rating on IMDb is pretty darn good, but Pinocchio deserves better than this. I've owned the VHS of Pinocchio for years as a kid, but always perceived it as too dark and somber so I stuck to the more upbeat Disney films like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc. It was only last year that I stumbled upon a Blu ray copy, that I rediscovered it. I was shocked to see how much beauty and elegance this film possesses. Music - it's poignant and memorable, and rightfully won two academy awards for score and song. Animation - it's amazing how much we're overlooking when watching these films as kids. From Geppetto's workshop to the Italian village to Pleasure Island to the bottom of the ocean. The image is consistently rich in detail and the velvety texture applied to the backgrounds is extraordinary. Like Snow White, Fantasia and Bambi, "Pinocchio" makes extensive use of the multi plane camera, giving the picture consistent depth and realism. I urge everyone who owns a Blu ray player to buy a copy. It will blow you away. Characters - Pinocchio features some of the most appealing characters in Disney history. I think everyone will agree that most of them here have become iconic: Pinocchio, Jimini, Geppetto, the Blue Fairy, Honest John, Gideon, Stromboli & Monstro. The story of course is the heart of the movie and there is something very intimate and warm about it. A lonely elderly man wishing for his puppet to become a real boy and then the obstacles that follow. The whole atmosphere of the film is yet to be recaptured and probably never will, given that Disney films nowadays lean toward gimmicky fluff and 3D. Years after my first viewing of this film, I have finally come to appreciate the beauty of it. I wish it had happened earlier. But better later than never.

    Of course no matter what your age, I'm sure you've at least heard of Disney's classic movie. It was the second in a long string of excellent classics created by Walt Disney and his wonderful team. In this movie, a toy and clock maker name Geppetto, along with his two pets, a cat named Pedro and a fish named Cleo, brings this classic to life! Pedro and Cleo both have personalities without even saying a word. Then after Geppetto creates a puppet, he wishes for the puppet to become real. Our story teller is a cricket named Jimminy. He becomes a classic part of Walt Disney and will appear in other Disney movies throughout the years. We also meet a boy named Lampwick who assures Pinocchio that it would be more fun to be bad then good. He plays pool, smokes cigars, and drinks beer (for those parents who are sensitive about that stuff, you might want to watch this part with your kids so you can discuss the good vs. evil). Most of the animals in this movie have personalities. I've already mentioned the cricket, cat, and fish. The whale had a booming personality. Famous songs were in this movie as well. Of course, we've all heard "When you wish upon a star," which becomes the theme song for Disney movies, even today. "Little Wooden Head," "Give a Little Whistle," and "I've Got No Strings" are also all great songs. Of course, the action in the ocean scene is a must see for sure! I've already mentioned the sins of Lampwick, but other things parents may want to be aware of in this classic are: Saloon dancing puppets with obvious cleavage and one scene where Jimminy Cricket touches the backside of a statue and makes a big deal out of it.

    Pinocchio is the classic tale of a lonely man without a child that builds himself a wooden puppet. The puppet comes alive but wishes to be a real boy. A lot of Disney's best work still holds up today. Pinocchio is an episodic but delightfully twisted film. It's basically a fable on how to choose between right from wrong but who cares when it has some scenes worthy of the best horror films. Pleasure Island is a twisted and terrifying place. The donkey's screaming is very disturbing, as is Lampwick's. He may be a jackass but he is still a little boy with a mother. Like many fairy tales movies adapted from books it's a bit jumpy, but at least this keeps the pace going.The morals are surprisingly strong and hold up today. The kids on Pleasure Island are a lot like actual children today, with drinking and smoking. It also shows a strong, single father relationship.

    What I like about Pinocchio is the beautiful animation. I also liked the voice acting in this film. Now here comes the problem with the film. The problem I find with the film is that certain things don't make any sense. For Example, Pinocchio developing a plan to get out of the whale "Monstro." How did he develop a plan to get out of the whale? In the beginning of the film, Pinocchio doesn't even know what a fire is! After Geppetto puts off the fire in Pinocchio's finger, he doesn't even tell Pinocchio about the danger of the fire. Geppetto plans to send Pinocchio to school next morning. And Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school "alone." Pinocchio doesn't even go to the first day of school. But he knows how to swim and he knows more than Geppetto about escaping out of whale's mouth. People might say "Come on. Don't take it seriously. Its just an animated film." But the purpose of story like Pinocchio is to convey a message like "Pinocchio can become a real boy if he proves himself "brave, truthful, and unselfish". So a certain degree of logic should be applied to a story like Pinocchio. Like learning things through his experiences. But Walt Disney focused on unimportant things like "Jiminy Cricket getting irritated by the sounds of the clocks, hour glass, and snoring." This doesn't add anything to the story. Instead Walt Disney and animators should have at least "implied" that Pinocchio learned about fire and learned about swimming before Geppetto took Pinocchio to school. But instead, Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school all by himself. But Pinocchio only became alive last night. Aside from these problems, it does have lots of interesting things in it. Characters are likable especially Pinocchio, Geppetto, Jiminy cricket, fairy, cat, fish, etc. I like Jiminy Cricket. Jiminy does have his limitations in helping. But he still "tries" his best in helping Pinocchio. Like I mentioned, the animation is great and I like the voice acting. But I feel that "certain" degree of logic should have applied to Pinocchio since the purpose of the story also has to do with conveying a message to the audience. Overall, I find the film enjoyable. 7 out of 10.

    Pinocchio is a breathtaking movie. It is one of the most beautiful animated movies. The story is engaging, the settings are magical, the characters are great, it simply embraces you with everything. Mixing its "dark" elements, and its "creepy" tone, with the "magical" atmosphere and the "uniqueness" of the movie, it all works out amazingly, and it makes the movie so authentic. It is hard to think Pinocchio was released just one year after Snow White, and that the production started just 3 years after Snow White's started. The animation is just wonderful, and the movie is not far away from being perfect. It is an engrossing, timeless movie. This is undoubtedly Disney Masterpiece. Its high quality proves that Pinocchio is one of the best animated movies...

    I have seen most of the animated Disney canon, the best of Pixar, the best of Ghibli, and so many other animated films, but not a one of them have continued to overpower and move me the way Pinocchio (1940) has. Ever since I first saw it at age 16, it has been my favorite animated feature. The animation is breathtaking. It's leagues ahead of what was achieved in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and still leagues ahead of most animated features made since.It's pure hand-drawn magic, almost impossible to surpass. (Pixar claimed Ratatouille (2007) surpassed it, but CG and traditional animation are two mediums too different to compare in my opinion. It's like comparing paintings and photography.) Every time I watch the film, I always notice some nuance or item in the background. The story is toned down and altered from the original novel, but what remains in this film is so good that I do not care. In fact, I think some of the changes were more effective, such as making the titular character more appealing. He is simply naive and thoughtless, not malicious. Pinocchio isn't the only one to develop either: after several viewings, I noticed that the initially irresponsible Jiminy and Geppetto also go through their own character arcs. Though The Black Cauldron (1985) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) are considered dark, they barely hold a candle to the frightening world of this film. As wicked as the Horned King and Frollo were, they got their comeuppance and did not live to see the end of their respective films. Not so in Pinocchio: the villains are not defeated, they will get to keep tricking, exploiting, murdering, and enslaving people long after the credits stop rolling. The heroes cannot defeat them. The best they can hope for is that they can escape with their lives and learn from the mistake. The movie is plainly stating that there is no way to rid the world of evil, rather bleak for a Disney film. (Thank God they never made a horrid DTV sequel where the boys on Pleasure Island are rescued, as it would undermine the horror of the original movie.) However, Pinocchio is at its heart an uplifting story. Though the world is cruel and evil cannot be vanquished, goodness and love still exist. The American Film Institute did right for once by putting it on their Most Inspiring Movies list. Pinocchio is a lovely experience, not only a great Disney film or a great animated film, but one of the greatest pictures ever made PERIOD. Don't miss out.

    After releasing a film that took years to make and not knowing what the end result would be, many wondered what Walt Disney could possibly create next after his 1st full-length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Well, Walt Disney started lining up more possible projects including more full-length animated features. He was considering many options for his second animated feature including Bambi (1942), Dumbo (1941), Alice in Wonderland (1951), Peter Pan (1953), and even Fantasia (1940), all of which would eventually become animated features later. Then, due to difficulties figuring out how to adapt the other stories to the big screen, Walt Disney finally decided for his 2nd animated feature to be Pinocchio (1940). This tale starts with a lonely wood carver named Gepetto finishing up on his newest marionette that he has called Pinocchio. He tells his two animal companions, a cat named Figaro and a fish named Cleo, that he wishes that Pinocchio was a real boy. One night, he gets his wish as a magical blue fairy brings this puppet to life. He isn't a real boy yet, but if he is able to prove his bravery, honesty and kindness, he will be one someday. Pinocchio is given a sidekick named Jiminy Cricket who will help him decide what's right or wrong and help make Gepetto proud. Now, Pinocchio is put to the test as he goes on many accidental misadventures such as becoming an actor, going to an island where you're allowed to do whatever you want (with a permanent price to pay, of course), and chasing down a monstrous whale. As was the case with Walt Disney's previous picture Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio (1940) is exceptionally well animated. The backgrounds are so painstakingly well detailed that you practically notice something new in the backgrounds every time you watch it. In terms of its visuals, it really pushes the envelope for what animated films can do with lighting, color, and other unique visual techniques. The music by Leigh Harline, Ned Washington, and Paul Smith is also worth commenting on. I think it's safe to say that all of us know how immortal and timeless the song "When You Wish Upon a Star" is. I think that playing this song during the opening credits was genius, since it's the best way to draw the audience's attention at the start of a film like this which is surprisingly darker than you might remember it being. Why do I say that Pinocchio is a slightly darker film than most people will remember it being? Because of the way the story convinces us how wrong it is to do whatever Pinocchio is manipulated into doing. For example, when Pinocchio tells a lie about why he didn't go to school to the blue fairy, his nose keeps on growing whenever he tells lie after lie. Another noteworthy example is when Pinocchio is manipulated into going to Pleasure Island where young boys smoke cigars, drink beer, play pool and other frowned upon activities for kids to be doing. After too much time there, the kids transform into donkeys that will be taken to work at the salt mines. The reasons why they somehow turn into donkeys are surreal to say the least, but let's just say this scene will scare off kids from smoking and drinkingÂ….at least for a while. I could have done without a few scenes at the beginning, which were solely devoted to showing off the sound effects and the details in Gepetto's workshop as opposed to continue telling the story. In short, Pinocchio gets off to a little bit of a slow start. I also thought that the ending to this film was sort of ripping off the ending from Snow White in a way that was less credible. If you've seen the ending to this film already, you'll know what plot device was used during that scene that I personally don't care for. On top of that, there were certain little details in the climax that didn't add up for me. Alright, guys. Prepare to detest me for what I'm about to say. I have to agree with Internet video film critic Doug Walker (of the Nostalgia Critic fame) when he said that Jiminy Cricket does not hold up well as a character. But I have my own reasons why I dislike this character. While I do agree with Doug that his sense of humor doesn't hold up well, the main reason I don't care for Jiminy Cricket any more is because he's way too careless, gives up too easily, and thinks he's right about everything. There are more than a few scenes that show just how blatantly inconsistent his character is, and how he switches back and forth between a sidekick with good intentions to a creature whose remarks are unjustified. In the end, I felt like Jiminy was way too inconsistent to the point where his character just didn't work. Ultimately, what still keeps Pinocchio a good Disney movie more than 70 years after its initial release is the animation, the music, and the way it reinforces the main morals of its story onto its young audience. Even though Jiminy Cricket's somewhat good intentions with his character backfired on me, I still liked Pinocchio himself. I admired how curious he was about the world around him, how positive his attitude was, and how clueless he was about what's good and what's bad. In other words, he felt like a real kid personality wise. This aspect and the ones I've mentioned before are good enough reasons why Pinocchio is a film that any Disney fans should take a look at.

Characters are likable especially Pinocchio, Geppetto, Jiminy cricket, fairy, cat, fish, etc. I like Jiminy Cricket. Jiminy does have his limitations in helping. But he still "tries" his best in helping Pinocchio. Like I mentioned, the animation is great and I like the voice acting. But I feel that "certain" degree of logic should have applied to Pinocchio since the purpose of the story also has to do with conveying a message to the audience. Overall, I find the film enjoyable. 7 out of 10.

    Pinocchio is a breathtaking movie. It is one of the most beautiful animated movies. The story is engaging, the settings are magical, the characters are great, it simply embraces you with everything. Mixing its "dark" elements, and its "creepy" tone, with the "magical" atmosphere and the "uniqueness" of the movie, it all works out amazingly, and it makes the movie so authentic. It is hard to think Pinocchio was released just one year after Snow White, and that the production started just 3 years after Snow White's started. The animation is just wonderful, and the movie is not far away from being perfect. It is an engrossing, timeless movie. This is undoubtedly Disney Masterpiece. Its high quality proves that Pinocchio is one of the best animated movies...

    I have seen most of the animated Disney canon, the best of Pixar, the best of Ghibli, and so many other animated films, but not a one of them have continued to overpower and move me the way Pinocchio (1940) has. Ever since I first saw it at age 16, it has been my favorite animated feature. The animation is breathtaking. It's leagues ahead of what was achieved in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and still leagues ahead of most animated features made since.It's pure hand-drawn magic, almost impossible to surpass. (Pixar claimed Ratatouille (2007) surpassed it, but CG and traditional animation are two mediums too different to compare in my opinion. It's like comparing paintings and photography.) Every time I watch the film, I always notice some nuance or item in the background. The story is toned down and altered from the original novel, but what remains in this film is so good that I do not care. In fact, I think some of the changes were more effective, such as making the titular character more appealing. He is simply naive and thoughtless, not malicious. Pinocchio isn't the only one to develop either: after several viewings, I noticed that the initially irresponsible Jiminy and Geppetto also go through their own character arcs. Though The Black Cauldron (1985) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) are considered dark, they barely hold a candle to the frightening world of this film. As wicked as the Horned King and Frollo were, they got their comeuppance and did not live to see the end of their respective films. Not so in Pinocchio: the villains are not defeated, they will get to keep tricking, exploiting, murdering, and enslaving people long after the credits stop rolling. The heroes cannot defeat them. The best they can hope for is that they can escape with their lives and learn from the mistake. The movie is plainly stating that there is no way to rid the world of evil, rather bleak for a Disney film. (Thank God they never made a horrid DTV sequel where the boys on Pleasure Island are rescued, as it would undermine the horror of the original movie.) However, Pinocchio is at its heart an uplifting story. Though the world is cruel and evil cannot be vanquished, goodness and love still exist. The American Film Institute did right for once by putting it on their Most Inspiring Movies list. Pinocchio is a lovely experience, not only a great Disney film or a great animated film, but one of the greatest pictures ever made PERIOD. Don't miss out.

    After releasing a film that took years to make and not knowing what the end result would be, many wondered what Walt Disney could possibly create next after his 1st full-length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Well, Walt Disney started lining up more possible projects including more full-length animated features. He was considering many options for his second animated feature including Bambi (1942), Dumbo (1941), Alice in Wonderland (1951), Peter Pan (1953), and even Fantasia (1940), all of which would eventually become animated features later. Then, due to difficulties figuring out how to adapt the other stories to the big screen, Walt Disney finally decided for his 2nd animated feature to be Pinocchio (1940). This tale starts with a lonely wood carver named Gepetto finishing up on his newest marionette that he has called Pinocchio. He tells his two animal companions, a cat named Figaro and a fish named Cleo, that he wishes that Pinocchio was a real boy. One night, he gets his wish as a magical blue fairy brings this puppet to life. He isn't a real boy yet, but if he is able to prove his bravery, honesty and kindness, he will be one someday. Pinocchio is given a sidekick named Jiminy Cricket who will help him decide what's right or wrong and help make Gepetto proud. Now, Pinocchio is put to the test as he goes on many accidental misadventures such as becoming an actor, going to an island where you're allowed to do whatever you want (with a permanent price to pay, of course), and chasing down a monstrous whale. As was the case with Walt Disney's previous picture Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio (1940) is exceptionally well animated. The backgrounds are so painstakingly well detailed that you practically notice something new in the backgrounds every time you watch it. In terms of its visuals, it really pushes the envelope for what animated films can do with lighting, color, and other unique visual techniques. The music by Leigh Harline, Ned Washington, and Paul Smith is also worth commenting on. I think it's safe to say that all of us know how immortal and timeless the song "When You Wish Upon a Star" is. I think that playing this song during the opening credits was genius, since it's the best way to draw the audience's attention at the start of a film like this which is surprisingly darker than you might remember it being. Why do I say that Pinocchio is a slightly darker film than most people will remember it being? Because of the way the story convinces us how wrong it is to do whatever Pinocchio is manipulated into doing. For example, when Pinocchio tells a lie about why he didn't go to school to the blue fairy, his nose keeps on growing whenever he tells lie after lie. Another noteworthy example is when Pinocchio is manipulated into going to Pleasure Island where young boys smoke cigars, drink beer, play pool and other frowned upon activities for kids to be doing. After too much time there, the kids transform into donkeys that will be taken to work at the salt mines. The reasons why they somehow turn into donkeys are surreal to say the least, but let's just say this scene will scare off kids from smoking and drinkingÂ….at least for a while. I could have done without a few scenes at the beginning, which were solely devoted to showing off the sound effects and the details in Gepetto's workshop as opposed to continue telling the story. In short, Pinocchio gets off to a little bit of a slow start. I also thought that the ending to this film was sort of ripping off the ending from Snow White in a way that was less credible. If you've seen the ending to this film already, you'll know what plot device was used during that scene that I personally don't care for. On top of that, there were certain little details in the climax that didn't add up for me. Alright, guys. Prepare to detest me for what I'm about to say. I have to agree with Internet video film critic Doug Walker (of the Nostalgia Critic fame) when he said that Jiminy Cricket does not hold up well as a character. But I have my own reasons why I dislike this character. While I do agree with Doug that his sense of humor doesn't hold up well, the main reason I don't care for Jiminy Cricket any more is because he's way too careless, gives up too easily, and thinks he's right about everything. There are more than a few scenes that show just how blatantly inconsistent his character is, and how he switches back and forth between a sidekick with good intentions to a creature whose remarks are unjustified. In the end, I felt like Jiminy was way too inconsistent to the point where his character just didn't work. Ultimately, what still keeps Pinocchio a good Disney movie more than 70 years after its initial release is the animation, the music, and the way it reinforces the main morals of its story onto its young audience. Even though Jiminy Cricket's somewhat good intentions with his character backfired on me, I still liked Pinocchio himself. I admired how curious he was about the world around him, how positive his attitude was, and how clueless he was about what's good and what's bad. In other words, he felt like a real kid personality wise. This aspect and the ones I've mentioned before are good enough reasons why Pinocchio is a film that any Disney fans should take a look at.

    Released over two years after Snow White, Pinocchio is not only as good as Disney's first, but it surpasses it. The story is about a marionette puppet that comes to life after the Fairy grants his father Gepetto's wish for Pinocchip to become a real boy. He has to prove the Fairy that he can be a real boy by being honest and selfless The characters in this film are less one-dimensional than the characters in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Pinocchio is an actual boy; he makes mistakes, he lies sometimes, and he sometimes wants to be bad, but he still wants to overall do the right thing. Jiminy Cricket is an alright sidekick, and Gepetto is such a happy, joyful character. You could tell Pinocchio brought him a lot of happiness. The cat, fish, and fairy are all enjoyable, delightful characters. The animation has improved as well since Snow White, and the filler scenes are reduced. The plot is well paced, and it is so funny when Pinocchio's nose grows every time he lies. The story is not very close to the original book, since the book is very dark and twisted, but no one expects an exact adaption to the book. The songs are very great. It's signature song "When You Wish Upon a Star" is also Disney's anthem. The song "I've Got No Strings" is pretty good as well. This film can appeal to both children and adults, and is very strong. It is definitely one of Disney's best films. Perfect entertainment.

    "I've got no strings to hold me..." Oops, sorry, I was having a moment there. As one of Disney's earliest films, the artistry here is so incredible you'd assume he had been churning them out for years. How could you not love the titular marionette and his faithful insect companion? Who wouldn't be scared stiff of the naughty boys turning into Jackasses on Pleasure Island? Why would you not be wowed at the ginormus whale Monstro chasing our heroes in a spectacular sequence? And anybody who doesn't find their foot tapping to the lovely songs (As ably demonstrated by my dulcet tones) officially has no soul. It's just a beautiful movie that will be appreciated for generations to come, and anyone who thinks it's just for kids would do well to pay attention to the lessons about honesty and loyalty contained within. Of course it's a lot of fun as well... Notice the hilarious clocks in Geppetto's cottage at the start. And of course there's the music... Oh dear, it's set me off again... "When you wish upon a staarr...". 8/10

    I know a 7.6 rating on IMDb is pretty darn good, but Pinocchio deserves better than this. I've owned the VHS of Pinocchio for years as a kid, but always perceived it as too dark and somber so I stuck to the more upbeat Disney films like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc. It was only last year that I stumbled upon a Blu ray copy, that I rediscovered it. I was shocked to see how much beauty and elegance this film possesses. Music - it's poignant and memorable, and rightfully won two academy awards for score and song. Animation - it's amazing how much we're overlooking when watching these films as kids. From Geppetto's workshop to the Italian village to Pleasure Island to the bottom of the ocean. The image is consistently rich in detail and the velvety texture applied to the backgrounds is extraordinary. Like Snow White, Fantasia and Bambi, "Pinocchio" makes extensive use of the multi plane camera, giving the picture consistent depth and realism. I urge everyone who owns a Blu ray player to buy a copy. It will blow you away. Characters - Pinocchio features some of the most appealing characters in Disney history. I think everyone will agree that most of them here have become iconic: Pinocchio, Jimini, Geppetto, the Blue Fairy, Honest John, Gideon, Stromboli & Monstro. The story of course is the heart of the movie and there is something very intimate and warm about it. A lonely elderly man wishing for his puppet to become a real boy and then the obstacles that follow. The whole atmosphere of the film is yet to be recaptured and probably never will, given that Disney films nowadays lean toward gimmicky fluff and 3D. Years after my first viewing of this film, I have finally come to appreciate the beauty of it. I wish it had happened earlier. But better later than never.

    Of course no matter what your age, I'm sure you've at least heard of Disney's classic movie. It was the second in a long string of excellent classics created by Walt Disney and his wonderful team. In this movie, a toy and clock maker name Geppetto, along with his two pets, a cat named Pedro and a fish named Cleo, brings this classic to life! Pedro and Cleo both have personalities without even saying a word. Then after Geppetto creates a puppet, he wishes for the puppet to become real. Our story teller is a cricket named Jimminy. He becomes a classic part of Walt Disney and will appear in other Disney movies throughout the years. We also meet a boy named Lampwick who assures Pinocchio that it would be more fun to be bad then good. He plays pool, smokes cigars, and drinks beer (for those parents who are sensitive about that stuff, you might want to watch this part with your kids so you can discuss the good vs. evil). Most of the animals in this movie have personalities. I've already mentioned the cricket, cat, and fish. The whale had a booming personality. Famous songs were in this movie as well. Of course, we've all heard "When you wish upon a star," which becomes the theme song for Disney movies, even today. "Little Wooden Head," "Give a Little Whistle," and "I've Got No Strings" are also all great songs. Of course, the action in the ocean scene is a must see for sure! I've already mentioned the sins of Lampwick, but other things parents may want to be aware of in this classic are: Saloon dancing puppets with obvious cleavage and one scene where Jimminy Cricket touches the backside of a statue and makes a big deal out of it.

    Pinocchio is the classic tale of a lonely man without a child that builds himself a wooden puppet. The puppet comes alive but wishes to be a real boy. A lot of Disney's best work still holds up today. Pinocchio is an episodic but delightfully twisted film. It's basically a fable on how to choose between right from wrong but who cares when it has some scenes worthy of the best horror films. Pleasure Island is a twisted and terrifying place. The donkey's screaming is very disturbing, as is Lampwick's. He may be a jackass but he is still a little boy with a mother. Like many fairy tales movies adapted from books it's a bit jumpy, but at least this keeps the pace going.The morals are surprisingly strong and hold up today. The kids on Pleasure Island are a lot like actual children today, with drinking and smoking. It also shows a strong, single father relationship.

    What I like about Pinocchio is the beautiful animation. I also liked the voice acting in this film. Now here comes the problem with the film. The problem I find with the film is that certain things don't make any sense. For Example, Pinocchio developing a plan to get out of the whale "Monstro." How did he develop a plan to get out of the whale? In the beginning of the film, Pinocchio doesn't even know what a fire is! After Geppetto puts off the fire in Pinocchio's finger, he doesn't even tell Pinocchio about the danger of the fire. Geppetto plans to send Pinocchio to school next morning. And Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school "alone." Pinocchio doesn't even go to the first day of school. But he knows how to swim and he knows more than Geppetto about escaping out of whale's mouth. People might say "Come on. Don't take it seriously. Its just an animated film." But the purpose of story like Pinocchio is to convey a message like "Pinocchio can become a real boy if he proves himself "brave, truthful, and unselfish". So a certain degree of logic should be applied to a story like Pinocchio. Like learning things through his experiences. But Walt Disney focused on unimportant things like "Jiminy Cricket getting irritated by the sounds of the clocks, hour glass, and snoring." This doesn't add anything to the story. Instead Walt Disney and animators should have at least "implied" that Pinocchio learned about fire and learned about swimming before Geppetto took Pinocchio to school. But instead, Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school all by himself. But Pinocchio only became alive last night. Aside from these problems, it does have lots of interesting things in it. Characters are likable especially Pinocchio, Geppetto, Jiminy cricket, fairy, cat, fish, etc. I like Jiminy Cricket. Jiminy does have his limitations in helping. But he still "tries" his best in helping Pinocchio. Like I mentioned, the animation is great and I like the voice acting. But I feel that "certain" degree of logic should have applied to Pinocchio since the purpose of the story also has to do with conveying a message to the audience. Overall, I find the film enjoyable. 7 out of 10.

    Released over two years after Snow White, Pinocchio is not only as good as Disney's first, but it surpasses it. The story is about a marionette puppet that comes to life after the Fairy grants his father Gepetto's wish for Pinocchip to become a real boy. He has to prove the Fairy that he can be a real boy by being honest and selfless The characters in this film are less one-dimensional than the characters in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Pinocchio is an actual boy; he makes mistakes, he lies sometimes, and he sometimes wants to be bad, but he still wants to overall do the right thing. Jiminy Cricket is an alright sidekick, and Gepetto is such a happy, joyful character. You could tell Pinocchio brought him a lot of happiness. The cat, fish, and fairy are all enjoyable, delightful characters. The animation has improved as well since Snow White, and the filler scenes are reduced. The plot is well paced, and it is so funny when Pinocchio's nose grows every time he lies. The story is not very close to the original book, since the book is very dark and twisted, but no one expects an exact adaption to the book. The songs are very great. It's signature song "When You Wish Upon a Star" is also Disney's anthem. The song "I've Got No Strings" is pretty good as well. This film can appeal to both children and adults, and is very strong. It is definitely one of Disney's best films. Perfect entertainment.

    "I've got no strings to hold me..." Oops, sorry, I was having a moment there. As one of Disney's earliest films, the artistry here is so incredible you'd assume he had been churning them out for years. How could you not love the titular marionette and his faithful insect companion? Who wouldn't be scared stiff of the naughty boys turning into Jackasses on Pleasure Island? Why would you not be wowed at the ginormus whale Monstro chasing our heroes in a spectacular sequence? And anybody who doesn't find their foot tapping to the lovely songs (As ably demonstrated by my dulcet tones) officially has no soul. It's just a beautiful movie that will be appreciated for generations to come, and anyone who thinks it's just for kids would do well to pay attention to the lessons about honesty and loyalty contained within. Of course it's a lot of fun as well... Notice the hilarious clocks in Geppetto's cottage at the start. And of course there's the music... Oh dear, it's set me off again... "When you wish upon a staarr...". 8/10

    I know a 7.6 rating on IMDb is pretty darn good, but Pinocchio deserves better than this. I've owned the VHS of Pinocchio for years as a kid, but always perceived it as too dark and somber so I stuck to the more upbeat Disney films like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc. It was only last year that I stumbled upon a Blu ray copy, that I rediscovered it. I was shocked to see how much beauty and elegance this film possesses. Music - it's poignant and memorable, and rightfully won two academy awards for score and song. Animation - it's amazing how much we're overlooking when watching these films as kids. From Geppetto's workshop to the Italian village to Pleasure Island to the bottom of the ocean. The image is consistently rich in detail and the velvety texture applied to the backgrounds is extraordinary. Like Snow White, Fantasia and Bambi, "Pinocchio" makes extensive use of the multi plane camera, giving the picture consistent depth and realism. I urge everyone who owns a Blu ray player to buy a copy. It will blow you away. Characters - Pinocchio features some of the most appealing characters in Disney history. I think everyone will agree that most of them here have become iconic: Pinocchio, Jimini, Geppetto, the Blue Fairy, Honest John, Gideon, Stromboli & Monstro. The story of course is the heart of the movie and there is something very intimate and warm about it. A lonely elderly man wishing for his puppet to become a real boy and then the obstacles that follow. The whole atmosphere of the film is yet to be recaptured and probably never will, given that Disney films nowadays lean toward gimmicky fluff and 3D. Years after my first viewing of this film, I have finally come to appreciate the beauty of it. I wish it had happened earlier. But better later than never.

    Of course no matter what your age, I'm sure you've at least heard of Disney's classic movie. It was the second in a long string of excellent classics created by Walt Disney and his wonderful team. In this movie, a toy and clock maker name Geppetto, along with his two pets, a cat named Pedro and a fish named Cleo, brings this classic to life! Pedro and Cleo both have personalities without even saying a word. Then after Geppetto creates a puppet, he wishes for the puppet to become real. Our story teller is a cricket named Jimminy. He becomes a classic part of Walt Disney and will appear in other Disney movies throughout the years. We also meet a boy named Lampwick who assures Pinocchio that it would be more fun to be bad then good. He plays pool, smokes cigars, and drinks beer (for those parents who are sensitive about that stuff, you might want to watch this part with your kids so you can discuss the good vs. evil). Most of the animals in this movie have personalities. I've already mentioned the cricket, cat, and fish. The whale had a booming personality. Famous songs were in this movie as well. Of course, we've all heard "When you wish upon a star," which becomes the theme song for Disney movies, even today. "Little Wooden Head," "Give a Little Whistle," and "I've Got No Strings" are also all great songs. Of course, the action in the ocean scene is a must see for sure! I've already mentioned the sins of Lampwick, but other things parents may want to be aware of in this classic are: Saloon dancing puppets with obvious cleavage and one scene where Jimminy Cricket touches the backside of a statue and makes a big deal out of it.

    Pinocchio is the classic tale of a lonely man without a child that builds himself a wooden puppet. The puppet comes alive but wishes to be a real boy. A lot of Disney's best work still holds up today. Pinocchio is an episodic but delightfully twisted film. It's basically a fable on how to choose between right from wrong but who cares when it has some scenes worthy of the best horror films. Pleasure Island is a twisted and terrifying place. The donkey's screaming is very disturbing, as is Lampwick's. He may be a jackass but he is still a little boy with a mother. Like many fairy tales movies adapted from books it's a bit jumpy, but at least this keeps the pace going.The morals are surprisingly strong and hold up today. The kids on Pleasure Island are a lot like actual children today, with drinking and smoking. It also shows a strong, single father relationship.

    What I like about Pinocchio is the beautiful animation. I also liked the voice acting in this film. Now here comes the problem with the film. The problem I find with the film is that certain things don't make any sense. For Example, Pinocchio developing a plan to get out of the whale "Monstro." How did he develop a plan to get out of the whale? In the beginning of the film, Pinocchio doesn't even know what a fire is! After Geppetto puts off the fire in Pinocchio's finger, he doesn't even tell Pinocchio about the danger of the fire. Geppetto plans to send Pinocchio to school next morning. And Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school "alone." Pinocchio doesn't even go to the first day of school. But he knows how to swim and he knows more than Geppetto about escaping out of whale's mouth. People might say "Come on. Don't take it seriously. Its just an animated film." But the purpose of story like Pinocchio is to convey a message like "Pinocchio can become a real boy if he proves himself "brave, truthful, and unselfish". So a certain degree of logic should be applied to a story like Pinocchio. Like learning things through his experiences. But Walt Disney focused on unimportant things like "Jiminy Cricket getting irritated by the sounds of the clocks, hour glass, and snoring." This doesn't add anything to the story. Instead Walt Disney and animators should have at least "implied" that Pinocchio learned about fire and learned about swimming before Geppetto took Pinocchio to school. But instead, Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school all by himself. But Pinocchio only became alive last night. Aside from these problems, it does have lots of interesting things in it. Characters are likable especially Pinocchio, Geppetto, Jiminy cricket, fairy, cat, fish, etc. I like Jiminy Cricket. Jiminy does have his limitations in helping. But he still "tries" his best in helping Pinocchio. Like I mentioned, the animation is great and I like the voice acting. But I feel that "certain" degree of logic should have applied to Pinocchio since the purpose of the story also has to do with conveying a message to the audience. Overall, I find the film enjoyable. 7 out of 10.

    Pinocchio is a breathtaking movie. It is one of the most beautiful animated movies. The story is engaging, the settings are magical, the characters are great, it simply embraces you with everything. Mixing its "dark" elements, and its "creepy" tone, with the "magical" atmosphere and the "uniqueness" of the movie, it all works out amazingly, and it makes the movie so authentic. It is hard to think Pinocchio was released just one year after Snow White, and that the production started just 3 years after Snow White's started. The animation is just wonderful, and the movie is not far away from being perfect. It is an engrossing, timeless movie. This is undoubtedly Disney Masterpiece. Its high quality proves that Pinocchio is one of the best animated movies...

    I have seen most of the animated Disney canon, the best of Pixar, the best of Ghibli, and so many other animated films, but not a one of them have continued to overpower and move me the way Pinocchio (1940) has. Ever since I first saw it at age 16, it has been my favorite animated feature. The animation is breathtaking. It's leagues ahead of what was achieved in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and still leagues ahead of most animated features made since.It's pure hand-drawn magic, almost impossible to surpass. (Pixar claimed Ratatouille (2007) surpassed it, but CG and traditional animation are two mediums too different to compare in my opinion. It's like comparing paintings and photography.) Every time I watch the film, I always notice some nuance or item in the background. The story is toned down and altered from the original novel, but what remains in this film is so good that I do not care. In fact, I think some of the changes were more effective, such as making the titular character more appealing. He is simply naive and thoughtless, not malicious. Pinocchio isn't the only one to develop either: after several viewings, I noticed that the initially irresponsible Jiminy and Geppetto also go through their own character arcs. Though The Black Cauldron (1985) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) are considered dark, they barely hold a candle to the frightening world of this film. As wicked as the Horned King and Frollo were, they got their comeuppance and did not live to see the end of their respective films. Not so in Pinocchio: the villains are not defeated, they will get to keep tricking, exploiting, murdering, and enslaving people long after the credits stop rolling. The heroes cannot defeat them. The best they can hope for is that they can escape with their lives and learn from the mistake. The movie is plainly stating that there is no way to rid the world of evil, rather bleak for a Disney film. (Thank God they never made a horrid DTV sequel where the boys on Pleasure Island are rescued, as it would undermine the horror of the original movie.) However, Pinocchio is at its heart an uplifting story. Though the world is cruel and evil cannot be vanquished, goodness and love still exist. The American Film Institute did right for once by putting it on their Most Inspiring Movies list. Pinocchio is a lovely experience, not only a great Disney film or a great animated film, but one of the greatest pictures ever made PERIOD. Don't miss out.

    After releasing a film that took years to make and not knowing what the end result would be, many wondered what Walt Disney could possibly create next after his 1st full-length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Well, Walt Disney started lining up more possible projects including more full-length animated features. He was considering many options for his second animated feature including Bambi (1942), Dumbo (1941), Alice in Wonderland (1951), Peter Pan (1953), and even Fantasia (1940), all of which would eventually become animated features later. Then, due to difficulties figuring out how to adapt the other stories to the big screen, Walt Disney finally decided for his 2nd animated feature to be Pinocchio (1940). This tale starts with a lonely wood carver named Gepetto finishing up on his newest marionette that he has called Pinocchio. He tells his two animal companions, a cat named Figaro and a fish named Cleo, that he wishes that Pinocchio was a real boy. One night, he gets his wish as a magical blue fairy brings this puppet to life. He isn't a real boy yet, but if he is able to prove his bravery, honesty and kindness, he will be one someday. Pinocchio is given a sidekick named Jiminy Cricket who will help him decide what's right or wrong and help make Gepetto proud. Now, Pinocchio is put to the test as he goes on many accidental misadventures such as becoming an actor, going to an island where you're allowed to do whatever you want (with a permanent price to pay, of course), and chasing down a monstrous whale. As was the case with Walt Disney's previous picture Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio (1940) is exceptionally well animated. The backgrounds are so painstakingly well detailed that you practically notice something new in the backgrounds every time you watch it. In terms of its visuals, it really pushes the envelope for what animated films can do with lighting, color, and other unique visual techniques. The music by Leigh Harline, Ned Washington, and Paul Smith is also worth commenting on. I think it's safe to say that all of us know how immortal and timeless the song "When You Wish Upon a Star" is. I think that playing this song during the opening credits was genius, since it's the best way to draw the audience's attention at the start of a film like this which is surprisingly darker than you might remember it being. Why do I say that Pinocchio is a slightly darker film than most people will remember it being? Because of the way the story convinces us how wrong it is to do whatever Pinocchio is manipulated into doing. For example, when Pinocchio tells a lie about why he didn't go to school to the blue fairy, his nose keeps on growing whenever he tells lie after lie. Another noteworthy example is when Pinocchio is manipulated into going to Pleasure Island where young boys smoke cigars, drink beer, play pool and other frowned upon activities for kids to be doing. After too much time there, the kids transform into donkeys that will be taken to work at the salt mines. The reasons why they somehow turn into donkeys are surreal to say the least, but let's just say this scene will scare off kids from smoking and drinkingÂ….at least for a while. I could have done without a few scenes at the beginning, which were solely devoted to showing off the sound effects and the details in Gepetto's workshop as opposed to continue telling the story. In short, Pinocchio gets off to a little bit of a slow start. I also thought that the ending to this film was sort of ripping off the ending from Snow White in a way that was less credible. If you've seen the ending to this film already, you'll know what plot device was used during that scene that I personally don't care for. On top of that, there were certain little details in the climax that didn't add up for me. Alright, guys. Prepare to detest me for what I'm about to say. I have to agree with Internet video film critic Doug Walker (of the Nostalgia Critic fame) when he said that Jiminy Cricket does not hold up well as a character. But I have my own reasons why I dislike this character. While I do agree with Doug that his sense of humor doesn't hold up well, the main reason I don't care for Jiminy Cricket any more is because he's way too careless, gives up too easily, and thinks he's right about everything. There are more than a few scenes that show just how blatantly inconsistent his character is, and how he switches back and forth between a sidekick with good intentions to a creature whose remarks are unjustified. In the end, I felt like Jiminy was way too inconsistent to the point where his character just didn't work. Ultimately, what still keeps Pinocchio a good Disney movie more than 70 years after its initial release is the animation, the music, and the way it reinforces the main morals of its story onto its young audience. Even though Jiminy Cricket's somewhat good intentions with his character backfired on me, I still liked Pinocchio himself. I admired how curious he was about the world around him, how positive his attitude was, and how clueless he was about what's good and what's bad. In other words, he felt like a real kid personality wise. This aspect and the ones I've mentioned before are good enough reasons why Pinocchio is a film that any Disney fans should take a look at.

Mixing its "dark" elements, and its "creepy" tone, with the "magical" atmosphere and the "uniqueness" of the movie, it all works out amazingly, and it makes the movie so authentic. It is hard to think Pinocchio was released just one year after Snow White, and that the production started just 3 years after Snow White's started. The animation is just wonderful, and the movie is not far away from being perfect. It is an engrossing, timeless movie. This is undoubtedly Disney Masterpiece. Its high quality proves that Pinocchio is one of the best animated movies...

    I have seen most of the animated Disney canon, the best of Pixar, the best of Ghibli, and so many other animated films, but not a one of them have continued to overpower and move me the way Pinocchio (1940) has. Ever since I first saw it at age 16, it has been my favorite animated feature. The animation is breathtaking. It's leagues ahead of what was achieved in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and still leagues ahead of most animated features made since.It's pure hand-drawn magic, almost impossible to surpass. (Pixar claimed Ratatouille (2007) surpassed it, but CG and traditional animation are two mediums too different to compare in my opinion. It's like comparing paintings and photography.) Every time I watch the film, I always notice some nuance or item in the background. The story is toned down and altered from the original novel, but what remains in this film is so good that I do not care. In fact, I think some of the changes were more effective, such as making the titular character more appealing. He is simply naive and thoughtless, not malicious. Pinocchio isn't the only one to develop either: after several viewings, I noticed that the initially irresponsible Jiminy and Geppetto also go through their own character arcs. Though The Black Cauldron (1985) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) are considered dark, they barely hold a candle to the frightening world of this film. As wicked as the Horned King and Frollo were, they got their comeuppance and did not live to see the end of their respective films. Not so in Pinocchio: the villains are not defeated, they will get to keep tricking, exploiting, murdering, and enslaving people long after the credits stop rolling. The heroes cannot defeat them. The best they can hope for is that they can escape with their lives and learn from the mistake. The movie is plainly stating that there is no way to rid the world of evil, rather bleak for a Disney film. (Thank God they never made a horrid DTV sequel where the boys on Pleasure Island are rescued, as it would undermine the horror of the original movie.) However, Pinocchio is at its heart an uplifting story. Though the world is cruel and evil cannot be vanquished, goodness and love still exist. The American Film Institute did right for once by putting it on their Most Inspiring Movies list. Pinocchio is a lovely experience, not only a great Disney film or a great animated film, but one of the greatest pictures ever made PERIOD. Don't miss out.

    After releasing a film that took years to make and not knowing what the end result would be, many wondered what Walt Disney could possibly create next after his 1st full-length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Well, Walt Disney started lining up more possible projects including more full-length animated features. He was considering many options for his second animated feature including Bambi (1942), Dumbo (1941), Alice in Wonderland (1951), Peter Pan (1953), and even Fantasia (1940), all of which would eventually become animated features later. Then, due to difficulties figuring out how to adapt the other stories to the big screen, Walt Disney finally decided for his 2nd animated feature to be Pinocchio (1940). This tale starts with a lonely wood carver named Gepetto finishing up on his newest marionette that he has called Pinocchio. He tells his two animal companions, a cat named Figaro and a fish named Cleo, that he wishes that Pinocchio was a real boy. One night, he gets his wish as a magical blue fairy brings this puppet to life. He isn't a real boy yet, but if he is able to prove his bravery, honesty and kindness, he will be one someday. Pinocchio is given a sidekick named Jiminy Cricket who will help him decide what's right or wrong and help make Gepetto proud. Now, Pinocchio is put to the test as he goes on many accidental misadventures such as becoming an actor, going to an island where you're allowed to do whatever you want (with a permanent price to pay, of course), and chasing down a monstrous whale. As was the case with Walt Disney's previous picture Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio (1940) is exceptionally well animated. The backgrounds are so painstakingly well detailed that you practically notice something new in the backgrounds every time you watch it. In terms of its visuals, it really pushes the envelope for what animated films can do with lighting, color, and other unique visual techniques. The music by Leigh Harline, Ned Washington, and Paul Smith is also worth commenting on. I think it's safe to say that all of us know how immortal and timeless the song "When You Wish Upon a Star" is. I think that playing this song during the opening credits was genius, since it's the best way to draw the audience's attention at the start of a film like this which is surprisingly darker than you might remember it being. Why do I say that Pinocchio is a slightly darker film than most people will remember it being? Because of the way the story convinces us how wrong it is to do whatever Pinocchio is manipulated into doing. For example, when Pinocchio tells a lie about why he didn't go to school to the blue fairy, his nose keeps on growing whenever he tells lie after lie. Another noteworthy example is when Pinocchio is manipulated into going to Pleasure Island where young boys smoke cigars, drink beer, play pool and other frowned upon activities for kids to be doing. After too much time there, the kids transform into donkeys that will be taken to work at the salt mines. The reasons why they somehow turn into donkeys are surreal to say the least, but let's just say this scene will scare off kids from smoking and drinkingÂ….at least for a while. I could have done without a few scenes at the beginning, which were solely devoted to showing off the sound effects and the details in Gepetto's workshop as opposed to continue telling the story. In short, Pinocchio gets off to a little bit of a slow start. I also thought that the ending to this film was sort of ripping off the ending from Snow White in a way that was less credible. If you've seen the ending to this film already, you'll know what plot device was used during that scene that I personally don't care for. On top of that, there were certain little details in the climax that didn't add up for me. Alright, guys. Prepare to detest me for what I'm about to say. I have to agree with Internet video film critic Doug Walker (of the Nostalgia Critic fame) when he said that Jiminy Cricket does not hold up well as a character. But I have my own reasons why I dislike this character. While I do agree with Doug that his sense of humor doesn't hold up well, the main reason I don't care for Jiminy Cricket any more is because he's way too careless, gives up too easily, and thinks he's right about everything. There are more than a few scenes that show just how blatantly inconsistent his character is, and how he switches back and forth between a sidekick with good intentions to a creature whose remarks are unjustified. In the end, I felt like Jiminy was way too inconsistent to the point where his character just didn't work. Ultimately, what still keeps Pinocchio a good Disney movie more than 70 years after its initial release is the animation, the music, and the way it reinforces the main morals of its story onto its young audience. Even though Jiminy Cricket's somewhat good intentions with his character backfired on me, I still liked Pinocchio himself. I admired how curious he was about the world around him, how positive his attitude was, and how clueless he was about what's good and what's bad. In other words, he felt like a real kid personality wise. This aspect and the ones I've mentioned before are good enough reasons why Pinocchio is a film that any Disney fans should take a look at.

    Released over two years after Snow White, Pinocchio is not only as good as Disney's first, but it surpasses it. The story is about a marionette puppet that comes to life after the Fairy grants his father Gepetto's wish for Pinocchip to become a real boy. He has to prove the Fairy that he can be a real boy by being honest and selfless The characters in this film are less one-dimensional than the characters in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Pinocchio is an actual boy; he makes mistakes, he lies sometimes, and he sometimes wants to be bad, but he still wants to overall do the right thing. Jiminy Cricket is an alright sidekick, and Gepetto is such a happy, joyful character. You could tell Pinocchio brought him a lot of happiness. The cat, fish, and fairy are all enjoyable, delightful characters. The animation has improved as well since Snow White, and the filler scenes are reduced. The plot is well paced, and it is so funny when Pinocchio's nose grows every time he lies. The story is not very close to the original book, since the book is very dark and twisted, but no one expects an exact adaption to the book. The songs are very great. It's signature song "When You Wish Upon a Star" is also Disney's anthem. The song "I've Got No Strings" is pretty good as well. This film can appeal to both children and adults, and is very strong. It is definitely one of Disney's best films. Perfect entertainment.

    "I've got no strings to hold me..." Oops, sorry, I was having a moment there. As one of Disney's earliest films, the artistry here is so incredible you'd assume he had been churning them out for years. How could you not love the titular marionette and his faithful insect companion? Who wouldn't be scared stiff of the naughty boys turning into Jackasses on Pleasure Island? Why would you not be wowed at the ginormus whale Monstro chasing our heroes in a spectacular sequence? And anybody who doesn't find their foot tapping to the lovely songs (As ably demonstrated by my dulcet tones) officially has no soul. It's just a beautiful movie that will be appreciated for generations to come, and anyone who thinks it's just for kids would do well to pay attention to the lessons about honesty and loyalty contained within. Of course it's a lot of fun as well... Notice the hilarious clocks in Geppetto's cottage at the start. And of course there's the music... Oh dear, it's set me off again... "When you wish upon a staarr...". 8/10

    I know a 7.6 rating on IMDb is pretty darn good, but Pinocchio deserves better than this. I've owned the VHS of Pinocchio for years as a kid, but always perceived it as too dark and somber so I stuck to the more upbeat Disney films like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc. It was only last year that I stumbled upon a Blu ray copy, that I rediscovered it. I was shocked to see how much beauty and elegance this film possesses. Music - it's poignant and memorable, and rightfully won two academy awards for score and song. Animation - it's amazing how much we're overlooking when watching these films as kids. From Geppetto's workshop to the Italian village to Pleasure Island to the bottom of the ocean. The image is consistently rich in detail and the velvety texture applied to the backgrounds is extraordinary. Like Snow White, Fantasia and Bambi, "Pinocchio" makes extensive use of the multi plane camera, giving the picture consistent depth and realism. I urge everyone who owns a Blu ray player to buy a copy. It will blow you away. Characters - Pinocchio features some of the most appealing characters in Disney history. I think everyone will agree that most of them here have become iconic: Pinocchio, Jimini, Geppetto, the Blue Fairy, Honest John, Gideon, Stromboli & Monstro. The story of course is the heart of the movie and there is something very intimate and warm about it. A lonely elderly man wishing for his puppet to become a real boy and then the obstacles that follow. The whole atmosphere of the film is yet to be recaptured and probably never will, given that Disney films nowadays lean toward gimmicky fluff and 3D. Years after my first viewing of this film, I have finally come to appreciate the beauty of it. I wish it had happened earlier. But better later than never.

    Of course no matter what your age, I'm sure you've at least heard of Disney's classic movie. It was the second in a long string of excellent classics created by Walt Disney and his wonderful team. In this movie, a toy and clock maker name Geppetto, along with his two pets, a cat named Pedro and a fish named Cleo, brings this classic to life! Pedro and Cleo both have personalities without even saying a word. Then after Geppetto creates a puppet, he wishes for the puppet to become real. Our story teller is a cricket named Jimminy. He becomes a classic part of Walt Disney and will appear in other Disney movies throughout the years. We also meet a boy named Lampwick who assures Pinocchio that it would be more fun to be bad then good. He plays pool, smokes cigars, and drinks beer (for those parents who are sensitive about that stuff, you might want to watch this part with your kids so you can discuss the good vs. evil). Most of the animals in this movie have personalities. I've already mentioned the cricket, cat, and fish. The whale had a booming personality. Famous songs were in this movie as well. Of course, we've all heard "When you wish upon a star," which becomes the theme song for Disney movies, even today. "Little Wooden Head," "Give a Little Whistle," and "I've Got No Strings" are also all great songs. Of course, the action in the ocean scene is a must see for sure! I've already mentioned the sins of Lampwick, but other things parents may want to be aware of in this classic are: Saloon dancing puppets with obvious cleavage and one scene where Jimminy Cricket touches the backside of a statue and makes a big deal out of it.

    Pinocchio is the classic tale of a lonely man without a child that builds himself a wooden puppet. The puppet comes alive but wishes to be a real boy. A lot of Disney's best work still holds up today. Pinocchio is an episodic but delightfully twisted film. It's basically a fable on how to choose between right from wrong but who cares when it has some scenes worthy of the best horror films. Pleasure Island is a twisted and terrifying place. The donkey's screaming is very disturbing, as is Lampwick's. He may be a jackass but he is still a little boy with a mother. Like many fairy tales movies adapted from books it's a bit jumpy, but at least this keeps the pace going.The morals are surprisingly strong and hold up today. The kids on Pleasure Island are a lot like actual children today, with drinking and smoking. It also shows a strong, single father relationship.

    What I like about Pinocchio is the beautiful animation. I also liked the voice acting in this film. Now here comes the problem with the film. The problem I find with the film is that certain things don't make any sense. For Example, Pinocchio developing a plan to get out of the whale "Monstro." How did he develop a plan to get out of the whale? In the beginning of the film, Pinocchio doesn't even know what a fire is! After Geppetto puts off the fire in Pinocchio's finger, he doesn't even tell Pinocchio about the danger of the fire. Geppetto plans to send Pinocchio to school next morning. And Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school "alone." Pinocchio doesn't even go to the first day of school. But he knows how to swim and he knows more than Geppetto about escaping out of whale's mouth. People might say "Come on. Don't take it seriously. Its just an animated film." But the purpose of story like Pinocchio is to convey a message like "Pinocchio can become a real boy if he proves himself "brave, truthful, and unselfish". So a certain degree of logic should be applied to a story like Pinocchio. Like learning things through his experiences. But Walt Disney focused on unimportant things like "Jiminy Cricket getting irritated by the sounds of the clocks, hour glass, and snoring." This doesn't add anything to the story. Instead Walt Disney and animators should have at least "implied" that Pinocchio learned about fire and learned about swimming before Geppetto took Pinocchio to school. But instead, Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school all by himself. But Pinocchio only became alive last night. Aside from these problems, it does have lots of interesting things in it. Characters are likable especially Pinocchio, Geppetto, Jiminy cricket, fairy, cat, fish, etc. I like Jiminy Cricket. Jiminy does have his limitations in helping. But he still "tries" his best in helping Pinocchio. Like I mentioned, the animation is great and I like the voice acting. But I feel that "certain" degree of logic should have applied to Pinocchio since the purpose of the story also has to do with conveying a message to the audience. Overall, I find the film enjoyable. 7 out of 10.
