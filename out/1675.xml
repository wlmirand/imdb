    A highly underrated movie. I absolutely loved it. I would have given it a ten, but I didn't care for the cringe-worthy, moaning song at the end, although I do understand the intent. Jon Seda is the lost boy, a rough survivor. life hasn't been kind to him. Woody Harrelson, is the all knowing, polished, college educated doctor, who has his own secret. Two different worlds come together. Each learn something from each other, and come to respect one another. I also enjoyed the reference to Tupac's Keep Ya Head Up. The movie contains a message for today's youth, and for the adults, for people of different races, from different socio-economic backgrounds, and different points-of-view. After the good doctor spent a whole day with this kid from hell, the doctor came to face some of his own devils. It's personal and soul searching depth may make some uncomfortable. Not everyone wants to look own into the depths of their own soul.

    For the first time I saw this movie 15 years ago. Over the years, I have looked through a lot of films, from cult to mediocre, from comedic to dramatic. But this film is still one of my dearly loved, and as far as I know, not just me. If this film is not a bomb, then at least the grenade)) Producer's work - it's just brilliant, the envy of many others. Casting - could not be better. The film draws from the first minute and did not let go until the very end of the two hours fly by. And the innuendo in the end of the film leaves food for thought. Seda played the role perfectly, personally I just admired his game. Harrelson - as always inimitable! "Sunchaser" - this film is not for everyone, because not everyone will understand its depth and drama. But, in my opinion, the film turned out!

    I read some of the other reviews and I guess this movie has an emotional element to it, but I'm not wired that way. The thing that ruined the movie for me was the logic. In it, the main characters make one illogical choice after enough. One must suspend logic and believe that these characters would actually make the choices that they made and that was the painful part for me that ruined it. That and the tiring tiring stereotypes portrayed about minorities, urban life, small desert towns, (non-)religious folk, etc., etc. In the end it's a 2-hour movie, and the conclusion is so predictable and disappointing as to serve no justification for having labored through its poor plot/writing. **

    I loved this film. It is a profoundly deep and moving. This is a film that I don't get tired of watching. It touches the cores of your heart. The story involved a dying man (played by Seda) who kidnaps a self absorbed doctor (played by Harrelson)and along the way they both go through this journey of self discovery. I get emotional toward the end of this film and I think that it is beautifully acted and not well filmed, but sometimes you have to look pass that and see the overall message of the film, which the director was able to put forth. I highly recommend this film. I think this is one Harrelson best film that I have seen him in and Jon Seda shows that he has potential to be a great actor due to his fine acting in this film.

    The Sunchaser is a standard-fare movie with a plot that's set up to provide a predictable outcome. Woodie Harrelson plays an eminent surgeon who's responsible for the welfare of a terminally-ill half-Indian, half-homey-from-the-hood 16 year-old serving a custodial sentence for murder. The two principal characters couldn't be more diametrically opposed if they tried - they come from opposite sides of the social track. The only thing keeping the young man alive is the dream of a mythical Navajo holy mountain with a sacred healing lake, which sets in motion a sequence of events that leads to Harrelson's kidnap and flight across several states at gunpoint. Harrelson's surgeon is a pragmatist and natural-born scientific sceptic who doesn't share the youth's flights of fancy. There's sufficient tension between the two characters to maintain the plot's momentum. Harrelson plays the predictable sceptic who eventually capitulates after much soul-searching and bonding with the criminal-minded youth, and finally assists the young man to his destination. There are some touching moments and an indisputable magic in the final scene as the young man is escorted by an Indian holy-man to the lake. The movie finishes rather abruptly without filling in what happens to the youth after his submergence into the lake, and only giving us a glimpse of Harrelson in handcuffs being led by FBI agents to his wife and baby daughter as the credits roll. The throughline of the movie is simple: the journey the soul needs to make to embrace hope and faith. It's nothing special as far as movies in general go; however, it stands out as one of the best examples of a road-movie.

    Have to say I'm a massive fan of the road movie genre, films like Duel, Breakdown, Roadkill and Wolf Creek. This film was really quite different. There's a kind of spiritual theme to it all. Towards the latter stages of the picture, the audience get a sense of the character development and how the Doctor (Woody Harrelson), who incidentally excels in this, builds a sort of relationship with the kidnapper and cancer sufferer (Jon Seda), who really shows what he can do as a teenage convict - pure genius, a magnificent performance. So here goes. While being transferred, Seda manages to escape the police escort and when Harrelson comes over to take a look, Seda takes him hostage and a whole road movie starts. What's great is the fact that the audience often underestimate the character of Blue. He actually shows he's got levels of intelligence when he explains to the Doctor (who thinks he will die) after a rattlesnake bite, that using electricity works wonders, so using the car, Seda puts his magic to the test. We see that as well as the foul-mouthed fool that Reynolds believes he is, Blue is actually a believer and has faith, hence his journey to the sacred lake that supposedly has healing powers "May beauty be behind me, in front of me, above me, below me and aaalll around me". Very emotional as it nears its climax and one heck of a movie. Just cannot praise it enough + I would love to see Seda back in action on the big screen, this time in some more prominent pictures.

    I watched it almost alone in a Italian theater a few years ago and I liked it very much for there is soul in this movie which is about soul. the question raised by sunchaser is: what can a man earn after he has lost its soul? the answers is: nothing. because nothing you can buy (be it an expensive car, a luxury home or the prettiest woman) can replace or substitute it. so care about your soul, live up to the great questions that life brings and do not try to skip them. as an Italian i admit that I enjoyed very much the beautiful landscapes portrayed by this master of the camera.

    i think this film is really emotional to watch because it shows hurt, pain, hope and excitement all in one film. Jon Seda who plays blue gives an excellent performance in this film and i reckon deserves an Oscar!. i believe this film should be an example of the desperation of some people in the world, who go to any lengths to save their lives or what they believe in. Woody Harrelson also gives what i reckon is one of his best ever performances. he seems to be able to use his character as a doctor to his full advantage, and yet show an understanding side to blue. I really would recommend anybody to watch this film, because it is such an eye opener.

    I read some of the other reviews and I guess this movie has an emotional element to it, but I'm not wired that way. The thing that ruined the movie for me was the logic. In it, the main characters make one illogical choice after enough. One must suspend logic and believe that these characters would actually make the choices that they made and that was the painful part for me that ruined it. That and the tiring tiring stereotypes portrayed about minorities, urban life, small desert towns, (non-)religious folk, etc., etc. In the end it's a 2-hour movie, and the conclusion is so predictable and disappointing as to serve no justification for having labored through its poor plot/writing. **

    I loved this film. It is a profoundly deep and moving. This is a film that I don't get tired of watching. It touches the cores of your heart. The story involved a dying man (played by Seda) who kidnaps a self absorbed doctor (played by Harrelson)and along the way they both go through this journey of self discovery. I get emotional toward the end of this film and I think that it is beautifully acted and not well filmed, but sometimes you have to look pass that and see the overall message of the film, which the director was able to put forth. I highly recommend this film. I think this is one Harrelson best film that I have seen him in and Jon Seda shows that he has potential to be a great actor due to his fine acting in this film.

    The Sunchaser is a standard-fare movie with a plot that's set up to provide a predictable outcome. Woodie Harrelson plays an eminent surgeon who's responsible for the welfare of a terminally-ill half-Indian, half-homey-from-the-hood 16 year-old serving a custodial sentence for murder. The two principal characters couldn't be more diametrically opposed if they tried - they come from opposite sides of the social track. The only thing keeping the young man alive is the dream of a mythical Navajo holy mountain with a sacred healing lake, which sets in motion a sequence of events that leads to Harrelson's kidnap and flight across several states at gunpoint. Harrelson's surgeon is a pragmatist and natural-born scientific sceptic who doesn't share the youth's flights of fancy. There's sufficient tension between the two characters to maintain the plot's momentum. Harrelson plays the predictable sceptic who eventually capitulates after much soul-searching and bonding with the criminal-minded youth, and finally assists the young man to his destination. There are some touching moments and an indisputable magic in the final scene as the young man is escorted by an Indian holy-man to the lake. The movie finishes rather abruptly without filling in what happens to the youth after his submergence into the lake, and only giving us a glimpse of Harrelson in handcuffs being led by FBI agents to his wife and baby daughter as the credits roll. The throughline of the movie is simple: the journey the soul needs to make to embrace hope and faith. It's nothing special as far as movies in general go; however, it stands out as one of the best examples of a road-movie.

    Have to say I'm a massive fan of the road movie genre, films like Duel, Breakdown, Roadkill and Wolf Creek. This film was really quite different. There's a kind of spiritual theme to it all. Towards the latter stages of the picture, the audience get a sense of the character development and how the Doctor (Woody Harrelson), who incidentally excels in this, builds a sort of relationship with the kidnapper and cancer sufferer (Jon Seda), who really shows what he can do as a teenage convict - pure genius, a magnificent performance. So here goes. While being transferred, Seda manages to escape the police escort and when Harrelson comes over to take a look, Seda takes him hostage and a whole road movie starts. What's great is the fact that the audience often underestimate the character of Blue. He actually shows he's got levels of intelligence when he explains to the Doctor (who thinks he will die) after a rattlesnake bite, that using electricity works wonders, so using the car, Seda puts his magic to the test. We see that as well as the foul-mouthed fool that Reynolds believes he is, Blue is actually a believer and has faith, hence his journey to the sacred lake that supposedly has healing powers "May beauty be behind me, in front of me, above me, below me and aaalll around me". Very emotional as it nears its climax and one heck of a movie. Just cannot praise it enough + I would love to see Seda back in action on the big screen, this time in some more prominent pictures.

    I watched it almost alone in a Italian theater a few years ago and I liked it very much for there is soul in this movie which is about soul. the question raised by sunchaser is: what can a man earn after he has lost its soul? the answers is: nothing. because nothing you can buy (be it an expensive car, a luxury home or the prettiest woman) can replace or substitute it. so care about your soul, live up to the great questions that life brings and do not try to skip them. as an Italian i admit that I enjoyed very much the beautiful landscapes portrayed by this master of the camera.

    i think this film is really emotional to watch because it shows hurt, pain, hope and excitement all in one film. Jon Seda who plays blue gives an excellent performance in this film and i reckon deserves an Oscar!. i believe this film should be an example of the desperation of some people in the world, who go to any lengths to save their lives or what they believe in. Woody Harrelson also gives what i reckon is one of his best ever performances. he seems to be able to use his character as a doctor to his full advantage, and yet show an understanding side to blue. I really would recommend anybody to watch this film, because it is such an eye opener.
