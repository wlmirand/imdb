 <sinopse>
  The aliens are coming and their goal is to invade and destroy. Fighting superior technology, Man's best weapon is the will to survive.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  On July 2nd, communications systems worldwide are sent into chaos by a strange atmospheric interference. It is soon learned by the military that a number of enormous objects are on a collision course with Earth. At first thought to be meteors, they are later revealed to be gigantic spacecraft, piloted by a mysterious alien species. After attempts to communicate with the aliens go nowhere, David Levinson, an ex-scientist turned cable technician, discovers that the aliens are going to attack major points around the globe in less than a day. On July 3rd, the aliens all but obliterate New York, Los Angeles, and Washington. The survivors set out in convoys towards Area 51, a strange government testing ground where it is rumored the military has a captured alien spacecraft of their own. The survivors devise a plan to fight back against the enslaving aliens, and July 4th becomes the day humanity will fight for its freedom. July 4th is their Independence Day...

    Roland Emmerich directed this blockbuster hit about an alien invasion of Earth arriving just in time for the American Independence day celebrations. Jeff Goldblum stars as a brilliant computer specialist who has figured out the aliens' plan of attack, and tries to warn his ex-wife(played by Margaret Colin) who just by coincidence works in the White House for the President(Bill Pullman) Randy Quaid plays a drunken crop duster who was once abducted by a UFO, and sobers up to help lead the climatic assault against the mother ship, after much of the Earth has been decimated by alien attacks. Contrived and dumb film is still watchable on a popcorn level, and the climax is exciting, but if you want to see this sort of thing done right, watch Kenneth Johnson's "V" TV films instead. Nice that "The X-Files" gets a mention though!

    I watched both movies as a teenager and I found them both horrendous. I didn't know at the time that they were made by the same director, Roland Emmerich. Now, as an adult, I can certainly affirm that this director must be one of the worse influences the movie industry ever saw. Anyone spending the amount of money in making the type of movies he does and using it for repeating the same shallow clich&eacute;s over and over doesn't even deserve to be behind a camera. Granted, this guy is a goldmine for the industry. Indeed, most people just care about what this director offers: brainless action with a lot of explosions. So, perhaps, it's not the director fault after all... Hm, no, after reading again the titles this man spawned, I can only say GUILTY, before my eyes start to bleed. Emmerich, use your budget to save the Earth for real instead of destroying it over and over again (in fiction and with the waste of resources you use for the rubbish you direct).

    Roland Emmerich blows up lots of stuff. This isn't deep. Sure the computer virus idea is stupid. Who Cares? Will Smith is fighter pilot Captain Steven Hiller who takes on the aliens. Bill Pullman is President Thomas J. Whitmore and we get to see the White House blow up. Jeff Goldblum is the math genius David Levinson who comes up with the silly computer virus to take down the alien shield. It is an iconic picture. It is seen as the pinnacle of blow 'em up popcorn summer movie. With all the destruction, how could you possibly top that.

    Not sure I'd walk across the street for a free screening of a new Roland Emmerich movie these days, but boy he came out of the gate with some funif derivativepopcorn entertainment; 'Universal Soldier', 'Stargate' and 'Independence Day'. I hadn't seen the latter in probably a decade, so when I saw it peeking out of the morass that is the $5 DVD bin at my local Wal-Mart, I bit. Like when I went to my 20 year high school reunion last year, I expected the years to be unkind to the likes of Steven Hiller, David Levinson and President Whitmore, but to my surprise they looked better than ever. Maybe it was nostalgia (aka - Mental Botox), but I enjoyed every minute of this movie. Corny? Oh sure. Holes in its logic? A few (dozen). But it was *fun*. There was no naval gazing, no gray areas, just good old fashioned cheerful heroics. Not sure a sequel could be anything but a huge let down, but I'll be there opening day, popcorn in hand.

    Americans are mere days away from another festive Fourth of July celebration when a huge alien spaceship is detected near Earth's moon. From a secretive location in New Mexico (hint, hint!), the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute" (S.E.T.I.) informs the US Pentagon. No surprise if you're watching; of course, you already know we're on the verge of a massive alien attack. And, if they're attacking, we can safely assume they are unfriendly. The mystery about why they're here is explained, briefly, but it doesn't really matter why they're here - what matters is if and how we are to get rid of them... The task falls on the eight shoulders of four men, all Americans. They will have to save the world from whatever the aliens have up their sleeves, or whatever they're wearing on this visit... Our heroes are: youthful President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman), computer technician David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), drunken crop-duster Russell Casse (Randy Quaid) and cocky pilot Steven Hiller (Will Smith). All of these people, and the majority of those supporting them, are caricatures. A few could take their act directly into a parody of this film, without changing a thing. And, there is nothing imaginative or clever about the story, which adds up to less than the obvious sources it borrows from. We are left with a "feel good" message of diversity in the United States, and some striking special effect images. ***** Independence Day (6/25/96) Roland Emmerich ~ Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Randy Quaid

    Having watched this twice - once shortly after release and again last night - all I'm left with Is memories of cringing embarrassment.Flag- waving,'good old US of A' types will love It,everyone else will squirm In their seats. Basically,Invading Aliens are thwarted by Will Smith. But wait - Is that REALLY the American president flying a Jet-fighter and saving the Earth? What a guy!(What a joke more like!). In fact,I'm not sure which premise Is the most ludicrous - the president-cum-fighter pilot or the crop-spraying fighter-pilot. Yes,you heard right - a middle-aged,alcoholic crop-sprayer who's only ever flown a Cessna becomes a Tee-total,stone-cold sober Jet-fighter Ace pilot In....wait for It...two hours!Even If we put reality on hold for a while and pretend that the difference between a light Aircraft and a fighter- 'plane ISN'T like comparing a hedge trimmer to a combine harvester,we then need to get our heads around a hopeless drunk becoming totally drink free AND sober In literally a couple of hours IN ADDITION to his crash-course In fighter pilot training! What an absolute load of garbage! The special effects are quite good,there's no doubt about that,but the 'Mega-cliched' storyline Is sickening. Even the pre-schoolers will be baffled by this one. If you'r a 'Gung-Ho',flag-waving yank,you may just manage to watch this movie with tongue firmly In cheek,but weather you can do so without flushing with embarrassment Is another matter. Everyone else over the age of three will be hard-pressed to take It even a little seriously. If the script had been changed a little to make this a comedy,I'd have liked It. But It wasn't.And I didn't.

    I can't believe it. I hate this movie the same reason the Nostalgia Critic hated it. It's clich&eacute;d, the dialogue is too common or taken from another movie, and what the hell is this? I do admit, there are a few things I can comment that somewhat save it. 1. Will Smith - The guy is awesome. His lines are terrible, but he can kinda save it because it's the king of awesome, Will Smith. But because it's Will Smith in the role, he can make the line sound awesome from the start. I can give two stars for that. 2. The visuals - By God, the visuals are outstanding. It's exciting looking at them, and there's another two stars from me. But overall, the whole movie is just predictable, it's unoriginal, and most of all, there are too many plot holes. But I do admit, when I was a kid, I did enjoy it. Now, it's kinda boring. So then, it's still something you can enjoy, but not me.

    I have a bit of a soft-spot for this movie because this is one of the movies I remember seeing in theaters during the early stage of my life. And thoroughly enjoying, although I couldn't really grasp what the story was about entirely. Which might have been a positive thing, since seeing it now the plot is actually quite dumb. It's a feel good alien invasion movie though and entertaining. If you can get past how dumb and ridiculous the direction the story takes in this one. This is probably the first movie I saw with Will Smith in it and this is probably one of the movies in his career that kick started his career. He is badass but comedic at the same time, which he is in a lot of his movies. But the first time I saw his performance, I was enthralled by his entertaining acting chops. I subplots are irrelevant, which focuses in on 3 main characters and there female loved ones during the invasion. I thought it would have been better if the story focused more on how to fight the aliens. Even the politics and how the countries work together during that situation would have been more interesting. So yeah, this is a entertaining popcorn flick and a movie that left it's mark when it came out. In another words it's not a great, intelligent movie. But for a movie that came out during the 90's it still holds up to a degree. 7.4/10

    I was going over reviews of other people for this movie and there are many watchers who did not liked it & for sure to be sure i am sure they like " revenge of Chucky" :) , OK now i just want to discuss about its excellency firstly the star-cast then its story line and then level of entertainment , this movie is a blockbuster just because it is a proper entertainer. I still remember Presidents speech " today we celebrate our independence day " and i can watch it over and over because this is a feel good movie. Jeff Goldblum & Will Smith have played their part in simply awesome manner , they look awesome together. The sequence of cigar and one liners at many places are witty as well as entertaining. Now as it is a blockbuster already i can simply say it is one cool 90s movie with excellent special effects and action sequences therefore nonetheless anybody may say anything about this movie but my personal opinion will always be - "watch it & u will not regret it" :)

    Independence Day is one of those films that virtually defines "willing suspension of disbelief". The amount of "will" involved is substantial, but taken on those terms, it can actually be an enjoyable film (though fluffy enough to stuff a mattress). I wonder why I am inclined to give more latitude in this regard to some movies than others. It's a puzzle. Armageddon occupies approximately the same stature as Independence Day, and I was more than willing to be savagely dismissive of the former, whereas the latter gets a much more cushioned clubbing. Both films suffer from essentially the same maladies, cartoonish, one-dimensional characters, enough action-movie clich&eacute;s to choke a hippo, and plot holes larger than the spaceships themselves (which are pretty f-king huge.) These spaceships (which appear to be about a mile or so in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion and no apparent way of staying in the air--more on that in a moment) appear one morning over the major capitals of the world and... well, do nothing. Circling F16s, radio greetings and cute halter-clad teenage girls holding up "Welcome to Earth" signs garner no response. But David Levinson, a rogue scientist played by a suitably befuddled Jeff Goldblum, detects a synchronized radio pulse linking all the ships together and realizes that they are counting down to... something. Something pretty sinister, he assumes. Turns out to be true. The aliens, it seems, are bent on destroying humanity and taking over the planet. The aliens unleash their weaponry, destroying many of the earth's major cities and all seems lost, until Levinson and cocky air force pilot Steven Hiller, played by Will Smith, hatch a plan to pilot a captured alien saucer to the "mothership" in orbit around earth and disable the master computer system coordinating the attack. Plot holes and other absurdities abound. IMDb lists almost two hundred "goofs" for this film (which must be near the record, I would think.) Anachronisms, plot holes, character errors, audio-video unsynchronized, continuity errors, crew/equipment visible, errors in geography, factual errors and revealing mistakes all indicate that this is something rather less than high art, as a work of cinematic craftsmanship. MAJOR SPOILER FOLLOWS: By far the biggest plot hole is nothing less than the central plot device by which we earthlings defeat the supposedly technologically far superior aliens. Goldblum and Smith commandeer a two-person alien saucer (this is the one that crash-landed in Roswell New Mexico in 1947 and has been in storage at Area 51 ever since, according to the film) and fly it to the alien mothership. There they upload a computer virus into the mothership's main computer system, thus disabling the entire alien attack. Bear in mind that a computer virus is really just a computer program like any other, the only difference being that a virus is deliberately designed to do something nasty (to be completely technically accurate, it's unclear whether the program in question is really a "virus." A computer virus a program designed to self-replicate and spread to other connected systems, hence the name. The "virus" in the movie is certainly an example of "malware". Does it self-replicate and spread? Unclear.) The point is, to write a virus requires not only a thorough knowledge of the system it is to run on (so you know which vulnerabilities to exploit,) but also an ability to program in a language that system understands. A program written for a PC will not run on a Mac, and a program written for Linux likely won't run on either. Okay yes, that's not entirely accurate; but I'm trying to make a broader point here, that being: what are the odds that someone could write a program that would run on a computer system designed by ALIENS? Or use the appropriate communication protocol to upload it? Do the aliens use TCP/IP? What are the odds that any malware could, within seconds, completely disable an entire multi-node command and control system for an whole fleet of spaceships? Oh, and in a blatant example of product placement, the laptop used to upload the virus is a Macbook. Good thing the aliens use Apple computers too, huh? END OF SPOILER So,why do I hang onto this movie (yes, I do own it) and actually give is a decent rating? Because actually, it's rather fun. Yes, it's stupid, juvenile, ineptly made, ridiculously plotted and acted, and contains more holes than Swiss cheese, but taken on its own terms (one could almost call it camp), it's really quite an amusing couple of hours. Some of the shots of the alien mothership are actually kind of cool, too. Watch for Brent Spiner (Data on Star Trek TNG) as a quirky, neurotic Area 51 scientist who's been in the lab so long he has no idea relate to actual humans. Oh, and just how DO these spaceships stay in the air? One can assume they must weigh an awful lot, but they are able to float like soap bubbles above our biggest cities without doing any damage. Simple physics, i.e. Newton's Second Law of Motion, would demand that some sort of downward force be required to support all that weight. In physics terms, there would be no difference between supporting the ship's weight in the air, or on the ground, and that downward force would be borne by whatever is underneath. Even some sort of "levitation beam" would still need something to push against, and that something would be the ground below. In reality, the saucers wouldn't need to deploy their "primary weapon"... the weight of the spaceships alone would crush the entire city beneath them. I suppose you could argue that a sufficiently advanced alien civilization could have mastered some sort of anti-gravity technology, thereby nullifying the Earth's gravitational field in the vicinity of the ships. Maybe so. I rather think Einstein would have something to say about that. I know: nitpicky.

He is badass but comedic at the same time, which he is in a lot of his movies. But the first time I saw his performance, I was enthralled by his entertaining acting chops. I subplots are irrelevant, which focuses in on 3 main characters and there female loved ones during the invasion. I thought it would have been better if the story focused more on how to fight the aliens. Even the politics and how the countries work together during that situation would have been more interesting. So yeah, this is a entertaining popcorn flick and a movie that left it's mark when it came out. In another words it's not a great, intelligent movie. But for a movie that came out during the 90's it still holds up to a degree. 7.4/10

    I was going over reviews of other people for this movie and there are many watchers who did not liked it & for sure to be sure i am sure they like " revenge of Chucky" :) , OK now i just want to discuss about its excellency firstly the star-cast then its story line and then level of entertainment , this movie is a blockbuster just because it is a proper entertainer. I still remember Presidents speech " today we celebrate our independence day " and i can watch it over and over because this is a feel good movie. Jeff Goldblum & Will Smith have played their part in simply awesome manner , they look awesome together. The sequence of cigar and one liners at many places are witty as well as entertaining. Now as it is a blockbuster already i can simply say it is one cool 90s movie with excellent special effects and action sequences therefore nonetheless anybody may say anything about this movie but my personal opinion will always be - "watch it & u will not regret it" :)

    Independence Day is one of those films that virtually defines "willing suspension of disbelief". The amount of "will" involved is substantial, but taken on those terms, it can actually be an enjoyable film (though fluffy enough to stuff a mattress). I wonder why I am inclined to give more latitude in this regard to some movies than others. It's a puzzle. Armageddon occupies approximately the same stature as Independence Day, and I was more than willing to be savagely dismissive of the former, whereas the latter gets a much more cushioned clubbing. Both films suffer from essentially the same maladies, cartoonish, one-dimensional characters, enough action-movie clich&eacute;s to choke a hippo, and plot holes larger than the spaceships themselves (which are pretty f-king huge.) These spaceships (which appear to be about a mile or so in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion and no apparent way of staying in the air--more on that in a moment) appear one morning over the major capitals of the world and... well, do nothing. Circling F16s, radio greetings and cute halter-clad teenage girls holding up "Welcome to Earth" signs garner no response. But David Levinson, a rogue scientist played by a suitably befuddled Jeff Goldblum, detects a synchronized radio pulse linking all the ships together and realizes that they are counting down to... something. Something pretty sinister, he assumes. Turns out to be true. The aliens, it seems, are bent on destroying humanity and taking over the planet. The aliens unleash their weaponry, destroying many of the earth's major cities and all seems lost, until Levinson and cocky air force pilot Steven Hiller, played by Will Smith, hatch a plan to pilot a captured alien saucer to the "mothership" in orbit around earth and disable the master computer system coordinating the attack. Plot holes and other absurdities abound. IMDb lists almost two hundred "goofs" for this film (which must be near the record, I would think.) Anachronisms, plot holes, character errors, audio-video unsynchronized, continuity errors, crew/equipment visible, errors in geography, factual errors and revealing mistakes all indicate that this is something rather less than high art, as a work of cinematic craftsmanship. MAJOR SPOILER FOLLOWS: By far the biggest plot hole is nothing less than the central plot device by which we earthlings defeat the supposedly technologically far superior aliens. Goldblum and Smith commandeer a two-person alien saucer (this is the one that crash-landed in Roswell New Mexico in 1947 and has been in storage at Area 51 ever since, according to the film) and fly it to the alien mothership. There they upload a computer virus into the mothership's main computer system, thus disabling the entire alien attack. Bear in mind that a computer virus is really just a computer program like any other, the only difference being that a virus is deliberately designed to do something nasty (to be completely technically accurate, it's unclear whether the program in question is really a "virus." A computer virus a program designed to self-replicate and spread to other connected systems, hence the name. The "virus" in the movie is certainly an example of "malware". Does it self-replicate and spread? Unclear.) The point is, to write a virus requires not only a thorough knowledge of the system it is to run on (so you know which vulnerabilities to exploit,) but also an ability to program in a language that system understands. A program written for a PC will not run on a Mac, and a program written for Linux likely won't run on either. Okay yes, that's not entirely accurate; but I'm trying to make a broader point here, that being: what are the odds that someone could write a program that would run on a computer system designed by ALIENS? Or use the appropriate communication protocol to upload it? Do the aliens use TCP/IP? What are the odds that any malware could, within seconds, completely disable an entire multi-node command and control system for an whole fleet of spaceships? Oh, and in a blatant example of product placement, the laptop used to upload the virus is a Macbook. Good thing the aliens use Apple computers too, huh? END OF SPOILER So,why do I hang onto this movie (yes, I do own it) and actually give is a decent rating? Because actually, it's rather fun. Yes, it's stupid, juvenile, ineptly made, ridiculously plotted and acted, and contains more holes than Swiss cheese, but taken on its own terms (one could almost call it camp), it's really quite an amusing couple of hours. Some of the shots of the alien mothership are actually kind of cool, too. Watch for Brent Spiner (Data on Star Trek TNG) as a quirky, neurotic Area 51 scientist who's been in the lab so long he has no idea relate to actual humans. Oh, and just how DO these spaceships stay in the air? One can assume they must weigh an awful lot, but they are able to float like soap bubbles above our biggest cities without doing any damage. Simple physics, i.e. Newton's Second Law of Motion, would demand that some sort of downward force be required to support all that weight. In physics terms, there would be no difference between supporting the ship's weight in the air, or on the ground, and that downward force would be borne by whatever is underneath. Even some sort of "levitation beam" would still need something to push against, and that something would be the ground below. In reality, the saucers wouldn't need to deploy their "primary weapon"... the weight of the spaceships alone would crush the entire city beneath them. I suppose you could argue that a sufficiently advanced alien civilization could have mastered some sort of anti-gravity technology, thereby nullifying the Earth's gravitational field in the vicinity of the ships. Maybe so. I rather think Einstein would have something to say about that. I know: nitpicky.

    Roland Emmerich directed this blockbuster hit about an alien invasion of Earth arriving just in time for the American Independence day celebrations. Jeff Goldblum stars as a brilliant computer specialist who has figured out the aliens' plan of attack, and tries to warn his ex-wife(played by Margaret Colin) who just by coincidence works in the White House for the President(Bill Pullman) Randy Quaid plays a drunken crop duster who was once abducted by a UFO, and sobers up to help lead the climatic assault against the mother ship, after much of the Earth has been decimated by alien attacks. Contrived and dumb film is still watchable on a popcorn level, and the climax is exciting, but if you want to see this sort of thing done right, watch Kenneth Johnson's "V" TV films instead. Nice that "The X-Files" gets a mention though!

    I watched both movies as a teenager and I found them both horrendous. I didn't know at the time that they were made by the same director, Roland Emmerich. Now, as an adult, I can certainly affirm that this director must be one of the worse influences the movie industry ever saw. Anyone spending the amount of money in making the type of movies he does and using it for repeating the same shallow clich&eacute;s over and over doesn't even deserve to be behind a camera. Granted, this guy is a goldmine for the industry. Indeed, most people just care about what this director offers: brainless action with a lot of explosions. So, perhaps, it's not the director fault after all... Hm, no, after reading again the titles this man spawned, I can only say GUILTY, before my eyes start to bleed. Emmerich, use your budget to save the Earth for real instead of destroying it over and over again (in fiction and with the waste of resources you use for the rubbish you direct).

    Roland Emmerich blows up lots of stuff. This isn't deep. Sure the computer virus idea is stupid. Who Cares? Will Smith is fighter pilot Captain Steven Hiller who takes on the aliens. Bill Pullman is President Thomas J. Whitmore and we get to see the White House blow up. Jeff Goldblum is the math genius David Levinson who comes up with the silly computer virus to take down the alien shield. It is an iconic picture. It is seen as the pinnacle of blow 'em up popcorn summer movie. With all the destruction, how could you possibly top that.

    Not sure I'd walk across the street for a free screening of a new Roland Emmerich movie these days, but boy he came out of the gate with some funif derivativepopcorn entertainment; 'Universal Soldier', 'Stargate' and 'Independence Day'. I hadn't seen the latter in probably a decade, so when I saw it peeking out of the morass that is the $5 DVD bin at my local Wal-Mart, I bit. Like when I went to my 20 year high school reunion last year, I expected the years to be unkind to the likes of Steven Hiller, David Levinson and President Whitmore, but to my surprise they looked better than ever. Maybe it was nostalgia (aka - Mental Botox), but I enjoyed every minute of this movie. Corny? Oh sure. Holes in its logic? A few (dozen). But it was *fun*. There was no naval gazing, no gray areas, just good old fashioned cheerful heroics. Not sure a sequel could be anything but a huge let down, but I'll be there opening day, popcorn in hand.

    Americans are mere days away from another festive Fourth of July celebration when a huge alien spaceship is detected near Earth's moon. From a secretive location in New Mexico (hint, hint!), the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute" (S.E.T.I.) informs the US Pentagon. No surprise if you're watching; of course, you already know we're on the verge of a massive alien attack. And, if they're attacking, we can safely assume they are unfriendly. The mystery about why they're here is explained, briefly, but it doesn't really matter why they're here - what matters is if and how we are to get rid of them... The task falls on the eight shoulders of four men, all Americans. They will have to save the world from whatever the aliens have up their sleeves, or whatever they're wearing on this visit... Our heroes are: youthful President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman), computer technician David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), drunken crop-duster Russell Casse (Randy Quaid) and cocky pilot Steven Hiller (Will Smith). All of these people, and the majority of those supporting them, are caricatures. A few could take their act directly into a parody of this film, without changing a thing. And, there is nothing imaginative or clever about the story, which adds up to less than the obvious sources it borrows from. We are left with a "feel good" message of diversity in the United States, and some striking special effect images. ***** Independence Day (6/25/96) Roland Emmerich ~ Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Randy Quaid

    Having watched this twice - once shortly after release and again last night - all I'm left with Is memories of cringing embarrassment.Flag- waving,'good old US of A' types will love It,everyone else will squirm In their seats. Basically,Invading Aliens are thwarted by Will Smith. But wait - Is that REALLY the American president flying a Jet-fighter and saving the Earth? What a guy!(What a joke more like!). In fact,I'm not sure which premise Is the most ludicrous - the president-cum-fighter pilot or the crop-spraying fighter-pilot. Yes,you heard right - a middle-aged,alcoholic crop-sprayer who's only ever flown a Cessna becomes a Tee-total,stone-cold sober Jet-fighter Ace pilot In....wait for It...two hours!Even If we put reality on hold for a while and pretend that the difference between a light Aircraft and a fighter- 'plane ISN'T like comparing a hedge trimmer to a combine harvester,we then need to get our heads around a hopeless drunk becoming totally drink free AND sober In literally a couple of hours IN ADDITION to his crash-course In fighter pilot training! What an absolute load of garbage! The special effects are quite good,there's no doubt about that,but the 'Mega-cliched' storyline Is sickening. Even the pre-schoolers will be baffled by this one. If you'r a 'Gung-Ho',flag-waving yank,you may just manage to watch this movie with tongue firmly In cheek,but weather you can do so without flushing with embarrassment Is another matter. Everyone else over the age of three will be hard-pressed to take It even a little seriously. If the script had been changed a little to make this a comedy,I'd have liked It. But It wasn't.And I didn't.

    I can't believe it. I hate this movie the same reason the Nostalgia Critic hated it. It's clich&eacute;d, the dialogue is too common or taken from another movie, and what the hell is this? I do admit, there are a few things I can comment that somewhat save it. 1. Will Smith - The guy is awesome. His lines are terrible, but he can kinda save it because it's the king of awesome, Will Smith. But because it's Will Smith in the role, he can make the line sound awesome from the start. I can give two stars for that. 2. The visuals - By God, the visuals are outstanding. It's exciting looking at them, and there's another two stars from me. But overall, the whole movie is just predictable, it's unoriginal, and most of all, there are too many plot holes. But I do admit, when I was a kid, I did enjoy it. Now, it's kinda boring. So then, it's still something you can enjoy, but not me.

    I have a bit of a soft-spot for this movie because this is one of the movies I remember seeing in theaters during the early stage of my life. And thoroughly enjoying, although I couldn't really grasp what the story was about entirely. Which might have been a positive thing, since seeing it now the plot is actually quite dumb. It's a feel good alien invasion movie though and entertaining. If you can get past how dumb and ridiculous the direction the story takes in this one. This is probably the first movie I saw with Will Smith in it and this is probably one of the movies in his career that kick started his career.

The task falls on the eight shoulders of four men, all Americans. They will have to save the world from whatever the aliens have up their sleeves, or whatever they're wearing on this visit... Our heroes are: youthful President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman), computer technician David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), drunken crop-duster Russell Casse (Randy Quaid) and cocky pilot Steven Hiller (Will Smith). All of these people, and the majority of those supporting them, are caricatures. A few could take their act directly into a parody of this film, without changing a thing. And, there is nothing imaginative or clever about the story, which adds up to less than the obvious sources it borrows from. We are left with a "feel good" message of diversity in the United States, and some striking special effect images. ***** Independence Day (6/25/96) Roland Emmerich ~ Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Randy Quaid

    Having watched this twice - once shortly after release and again last night - all I'm left with Is memories of cringing embarrassment.Flag- waving,'good old US of A' types will love It,everyone else will squirm In their seats. Basically,Invading Aliens are thwarted by Will Smith. But wait - Is that REALLY the American president flying a Jet-fighter and saving the Earth? What a guy!(What a joke more like!). In fact,I'm not sure which premise Is the most ludicrous - the president-cum-fighter pilot or the crop-spraying fighter-pilot. Yes,you heard right - a middle-aged,alcoholic crop-sprayer who's only ever flown a Cessna becomes a Tee-total,stone-cold sober Jet-fighter Ace pilot In....wait for It...two hours!Even If we put reality on hold for a while and pretend that the difference between a light Aircraft and a fighter- 'plane ISN'T like comparing a hedge trimmer to a combine harvester,we then need to get our heads around a hopeless drunk becoming totally drink free AND sober In literally a couple of hours IN ADDITION to his crash-course In fighter pilot training! What an absolute load of garbage! The special effects are quite good,there's no doubt about that,but the 'Mega-cliched' storyline Is sickening. Even the pre-schoolers will be baffled by this one. If you'r a 'Gung-Ho',flag-waving yank,you may just manage to watch this movie with tongue firmly In cheek,but weather you can do so without flushing with embarrassment Is another matter. Everyone else over the age of three will be hard-pressed to take It even a little seriously. If the script had been changed a little to make this a comedy,I'd have liked It. But It wasn't.And I didn't.

    I can't believe it. I hate this movie the same reason the Nostalgia Critic hated it. It's clich&eacute;d, the dialogue is too common or taken from another movie, and what the hell is this? I do admit, there are a few things I can comment that somewhat save it. 1. Will Smith - The guy is awesome. His lines are terrible, but he can kinda save it because it's the king of awesome, Will Smith. But because it's Will Smith in the role, he can make the line sound awesome from the start. I can give two stars for that. 2. The visuals - By God, the visuals are outstanding. It's exciting looking at them, and there's another two stars from me. But overall, the whole movie is just predictable, it's unoriginal, and most of all, there are too many plot holes. But I do admit, when I was a kid, I did enjoy it. Now, it's kinda boring. So then, it's still something you can enjoy, but not me.

    I have a bit of a soft-spot for this movie because this is one of the movies I remember seeing in theaters during the early stage of my life. And thoroughly enjoying, although I couldn't really grasp what the story was about entirely. Which might have been a positive thing, since seeing it now the plot is actually quite dumb. It's a feel good alien invasion movie though and entertaining. If you can get past how dumb and ridiculous the direction the story takes in this one. This is probably the first movie I saw with Will Smith in it and this is probably one of the movies in his career that kick started his career. He is badass but comedic at the same time, which he is in a lot of his movies. But the first time I saw his performance, I was enthralled by his entertaining acting chops. I subplots are irrelevant, which focuses in on 3 main characters and there female loved ones during the invasion. I thought it would have been better if the story focused more on how to fight the aliens. Even the politics and how the countries work together during that situation would have been more interesting. So yeah, this is a entertaining popcorn flick and a movie that left it's mark when it came out. In another words it's not a great, intelligent movie. But for a movie that came out during the 90's it still holds up to a degree. 7.4/10

    I was going over reviews of other people for this movie and there are many watchers who did not liked it & for sure to be sure i am sure they like " revenge of Chucky" :) , OK now i just want to discuss about its excellency firstly the star-cast then its story line and then level of entertainment , this movie is a blockbuster just because it is a proper entertainer. I still remember Presidents speech " today we celebrate our independence day " and i can watch it over and over because this is a feel good movie. Jeff Goldblum & Will Smith have played their part in simply awesome manner , they look awesome together. The sequence of cigar and one liners at many places are witty as well as entertaining. Now as it is a blockbuster already i can simply say it is one cool 90s movie with excellent special effects and action sequences therefore nonetheless anybody may say anything about this movie but my personal opinion will always be - "watch it & u will not regret it" :)

    Independence Day is one of those films that virtually defines "willing suspension of disbelief". The amount of "will" involved is substantial, but taken on those terms, it can actually be an enjoyable film (though fluffy enough to stuff a mattress). I wonder why I am inclined to give more latitude in this regard to some movies than others. It's a puzzle. Armageddon occupies approximately the same stature as Independence Day, and I was more than willing to be savagely dismissive of the former, whereas the latter gets a much more cushioned clubbing. Both films suffer from essentially the same maladies, cartoonish, one-dimensional characters, enough action-movie clich&eacute;s to choke a hippo, and plot holes larger than the spaceships themselves (which are pretty f-king huge.) These spaceships (which appear to be about a mile or so in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion and no apparent way of staying in the air--more on that in a moment) appear one morning over the major capitals of the world and... well, do nothing. Circling F16s, radio greetings and cute halter-clad teenage girls holding up "Welcome to Earth" signs garner no response. But David Levinson, a rogue scientist played by a suitably befuddled Jeff Goldblum, detects a synchronized radio pulse linking all the ships together and realizes that they are counting down to... something. Something pretty sinister, he assumes. Turns out to be true. The aliens, it seems, are bent on destroying humanity and taking over the planet. The aliens unleash their weaponry, destroying many of the earth's major cities and all seems lost, until Levinson and cocky air force pilot Steven Hiller, played by Will Smith, hatch a plan to pilot a captured alien saucer to the "mothership" in orbit around earth and disable the master computer system coordinating the attack. Plot holes and other absurdities abound. IMDb lists almost two hundred "goofs" for this film (which must be near the record, I would think.) Anachronisms, plot holes, character errors, audio-video unsynchronized, continuity errors, crew/equipment visible, errors in geography, factual errors and revealing mistakes all indicate that this is something rather less than high art, as a work of cinematic craftsmanship. MAJOR SPOILER FOLLOWS: By far the biggest plot hole is nothing less than the central plot device by which we earthlings defeat the supposedly technologically far superior aliens. Goldblum and Smith commandeer a two-person alien saucer (this is the one that crash-landed in Roswell New Mexico in 1947 and has been in storage at Area 51 ever since, according to the film) and fly it to the alien mothership. There they upload a computer virus into the mothership's main computer system, thus disabling the entire alien attack. Bear in mind that a computer virus is really just a computer program like any other, the only difference being that a virus is deliberately designed to do something nasty (to be completely technically accurate, it's unclear whether the program in question is really a "virus." A computer virus a program designed to self-replicate and spread to other connected systems, hence the name. The "virus" in the movie is certainly an example of "malware". Does it self-replicate and spread? Unclear.) The point is, to write a virus requires not only a thorough knowledge of the system it is to run on (so you know which vulnerabilities to exploit,) but also an ability to program in a language that system understands. A program written for a PC will not run on a Mac, and a program written for Linux likely won't run on either. Okay yes, that's not entirely accurate; but I'm trying to make a broader point here, that being: what are the odds that someone could write a program that would run on a computer system designed by ALIENS? Or use the appropriate communication protocol to upload it? Do the aliens use TCP/IP? What are the odds that any malware could, within seconds, completely disable an entire multi-node command and control system for an whole fleet of spaceships? Oh, and in a blatant example of product placement, the laptop used to upload the virus is a Macbook. Good thing the aliens use Apple computers too, huh? END OF SPOILER So,why do I hang onto this movie (yes, I do own it) and actually give is a decent rating? Because actually, it's rather fun. Yes, it's stupid, juvenile, ineptly made, ridiculously plotted and acted, and contains more holes than Swiss cheese, but taken on its own terms (one could almost call it camp), it's really quite an amusing couple of hours. Some of the shots of the alien mothership are actually kind of cool, too. Watch for Brent Spiner (Data on Star Trek TNG) as a quirky, neurotic Area 51 scientist who's been in the lab so long he has no idea relate to actual humans. Oh, and just how DO these spaceships stay in the air? One can assume they must weigh an awful lot, but they are able to float like soap bubbles above our biggest cities without doing any damage. Simple physics, i.e. Newton's Second Law of Motion, would demand that some sort of downward force be required to support all that weight. In physics terms, there would be no difference between supporting the ship's weight in the air, or on the ground, and that downward force would be borne by whatever is underneath. Even some sort of "levitation beam" would still need something to push against, and that something would be the ground below. In reality, the saucers wouldn't need to deploy their "primary weapon"... the weight of the spaceships alone would crush the entire city beneath them. I suppose you could argue that a sufficiently advanced alien civilization could have mastered some sort of anti-gravity technology, thereby nullifying the Earth's gravitational field in the vicinity of the ships. Maybe so. I rather think Einstein would have something to say about that. I know: nitpicky.

    Roland Emmerich directed this blockbuster hit about an alien invasion of Earth arriving just in time for the American Independence day celebrations. Jeff Goldblum stars as a brilliant computer specialist who has figured out the aliens' plan of attack, and tries to warn his ex-wife(played by Margaret Colin) who just by coincidence works in the White House for the President(Bill Pullman) Randy Quaid plays a drunken crop duster who was once abducted by a UFO, and sobers up to help lead the climatic assault against the mother ship, after much of the Earth has been decimated by alien attacks. Contrived and dumb film is still watchable on a popcorn level, and the climax is exciting, but if you want to see this sort of thing done right, watch Kenneth Johnson's "V" TV films instead. Nice that "The X-Files" gets a mention though!

    I watched both movies as a teenager and I found them both horrendous. I didn't know at the time that they were made by the same director, Roland Emmerich. Now, as an adult, I can certainly affirm that this director must be one of the worse influences the movie industry ever saw. Anyone spending the amount of money in making the type of movies he does and using it for repeating the same shallow clich&eacute;s over and over doesn't even deserve to be behind a camera. Granted, this guy is a goldmine for the industry. Indeed, most people just care about what this director offers: brainless action with a lot of explosions. So, perhaps, it's not the director fault after all... Hm, no, after reading again the titles this man spawned, I can only say GUILTY, before my eyes start to bleed. Emmerich, use your budget to save the Earth for real instead of destroying it over and over again (in fiction and with the waste of resources you use for the rubbish you direct).

    Roland Emmerich blows up lots of stuff. This isn't deep. Sure the computer virus idea is stupid. Who Cares? Will Smith is fighter pilot Captain Steven Hiller who takes on the aliens. Bill Pullman is President Thomas J. Whitmore and we get to see the White House blow up. Jeff Goldblum is the math genius David Levinson who comes up with the silly computer virus to take down the alien shield. It is an iconic picture. It is seen as the pinnacle of blow 'em up popcorn summer movie. With all the destruction, how could you possibly top that.

    Not sure I'd walk across the street for a free screening of a new Roland Emmerich movie these days, but boy he came out of the gate with some funif derivativepopcorn entertainment; 'Universal Soldier', 'Stargate' and 'Independence Day'. I hadn't seen the latter in probably a decade, so when I saw it peeking out of the morass that is the $5 DVD bin at my local Wal-Mart, I bit. Like when I went to my 20 year high school reunion last year, I expected the years to be unkind to the likes of Steven Hiller, David Levinson and President Whitmore, but to my surprise they looked better than ever. Maybe it was nostalgia (aka - Mental Botox), but I enjoyed every minute of this movie. Corny? Oh sure. Holes in its logic? A few (dozen). But it was *fun*. There was no naval gazing, no gray areas, just good old fashioned cheerful heroics. Not sure a sequel could be anything but a huge let down, but I'll be there opening day, popcorn in hand.

    Americans are mere days away from another festive Fourth of July celebration when a huge alien spaceship is detected near Earth's moon. From a secretive location in New Mexico (hint, hint!), the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute" (S.E.T.I.) informs the US Pentagon. No surprise if you're watching; of course, you already know we're on the verge of a massive alien attack. And, if they're attacking, we can safely assume they are unfriendly.

Jeff Goldblum stars as a brilliant computer specialist who has figured out the aliens' plan of attack, and tries to warn his ex-wife(played by Margaret Colin) who just by coincidence works in the White House for the President(Bill Pullman) Randy Quaid plays a drunken crop duster who was once abducted by a UFO, and sobers up to help lead the climatic assault against the mother ship, after much of the Earth has been decimated by alien attacks. Contrived and dumb film is still watchable on a popcorn level, and the climax is exciting, but if you want to see this sort of thing done right, watch Kenneth Johnson's "V" TV films instead. Nice that "The X-Files" gets a mention though!

    I watched both movies as a teenager and I found them both horrendous. I didn't know at the time that they were made by the same director, Roland Emmerich. Now, as an adult, I can certainly affirm that this director must be one of the worse influences the movie industry ever saw. Anyone spending the amount of money in making the type of movies he does and using it for repeating the same shallow clich&eacute;s over and over doesn't even deserve to be behind a camera. Granted, this guy is a goldmine for the industry. Indeed, most people just care about what this director offers: brainless action with a lot of explosions. So, perhaps, it's not the director fault after all... Hm, no, after reading again the titles this man spawned, I can only say GUILTY, before my eyes start to bleed. Emmerich, use your budget to save the Earth for real instead of destroying it over and over again (in fiction and with the waste of resources you use for the rubbish you direct).

    Roland Emmerich blows up lots of stuff. This isn't deep. Sure the computer virus idea is stupid. Who Cares? Will Smith is fighter pilot Captain Steven Hiller who takes on the aliens. Bill Pullman is President Thomas J. Whitmore and we get to see the White House blow up. Jeff Goldblum is the math genius David Levinson who comes up with the silly computer virus to take down the alien shield. It is an iconic picture. It is seen as the pinnacle of blow 'em up popcorn summer movie. With all the destruction, how could you possibly top that.

    Not sure I'd walk across the street for a free screening of a new Roland Emmerich movie these days, but boy he came out of the gate with some funif derivativepopcorn entertainment; 'Universal Soldier', 'Stargate' and 'Independence Day'. I hadn't seen the latter in probably a decade, so when I saw it peeking out of the morass that is the $5 DVD bin at my local Wal-Mart, I bit. Like when I went to my 20 year high school reunion last year, I expected the years to be unkind to the likes of Steven Hiller, David Levinson and President Whitmore, but to my surprise they looked better than ever. Maybe it was nostalgia (aka - Mental Botox), but I enjoyed every minute of this movie. Corny? Oh sure. Holes in its logic? A few (dozen). But it was *fun*. There was no naval gazing, no gray areas, just good old fashioned cheerful heroics. Not sure a sequel could be anything but a huge let down, but I'll be there opening day, popcorn in hand.

    Americans are mere days away from another festive Fourth of July celebration when a huge alien spaceship is detected near Earth's moon. From a secretive location in New Mexico (hint, hint!), the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute" (S.E.T.I.) informs the US Pentagon. No surprise if you're watching; of course, you already know we're on the verge of a massive alien attack. And, if they're attacking, we can safely assume they are unfriendly. The mystery about why they're here is explained, briefly, but it doesn't really matter why they're here - what matters is if and how we are to get rid of them... The task falls on the eight shoulders of four men, all Americans. They will have to save the world from whatever the aliens have up their sleeves, or whatever they're wearing on this visit... Our heroes are: youthful President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman), computer technician David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), drunken crop-duster Russell Casse (Randy Quaid) and cocky pilot Steven Hiller (Will Smith). All of these people, and the majority of those supporting them, are caricatures. A few could take their act directly into a parody of this film, without changing a thing. And, there is nothing imaginative or clever about the story, which adds up to less than the obvious sources it borrows from. We are left with a "feel good" message of diversity in the United States, and some striking special effect images. ***** Independence Day (6/25/96) Roland Emmerich ~ Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Randy Quaid

    Having watched this twice - once shortly after release and again last night - all I'm left with Is memories of cringing embarrassment.Flag- waving,'good old US of A' types will love It,everyone else will squirm In their seats. Basically,Invading Aliens are thwarted by Will Smith. But wait - Is that REALLY the American president flying a Jet-fighter and saving the Earth? What a guy!(What a joke more like!). In fact,I'm not sure which premise Is the most ludicrous - the president-cum-fighter pilot or the crop-spraying fighter-pilot. Yes,you heard right - a middle-aged,alcoholic crop-sprayer who's only ever flown a Cessna becomes a Tee-total,stone-cold sober Jet-fighter Ace pilot In....wait for It...two hours!Even If we put reality on hold for a while and pretend that the difference between a light Aircraft and a fighter- 'plane ISN'T like comparing a hedge trimmer to a combine harvester,we then need to get our heads around a hopeless drunk becoming totally drink free AND sober In literally a couple of hours IN ADDITION to his crash-course In fighter pilot training! What an absolute load of garbage! The special effects are quite good,there's no doubt about that,but the 'Mega-cliched' storyline Is sickening. Even the pre-schoolers will be baffled by this one. If you'r a 'Gung-Ho',flag-waving yank,you may just manage to watch this movie with tongue firmly In cheek,but weather you can do so without flushing with embarrassment Is another matter. Everyone else over the age of three will be hard-pressed to take It even a little seriously. If the script had been changed a little to make this a comedy,I'd have liked It. But It wasn't.And I didn't.

    I can't believe it. I hate this movie the same reason the Nostalgia Critic hated it. It's clich&eacute;d, the dialogue is too common or taken from another movie, and what the hell is this? I do admit, there are a few things I can comment that somewhat save it. 1. Will Smith - The guy is awesome. His lines are terrible, but he can kinda save it because it's the king of awesome, Will Smith. But because it's Will Smith in the role, he can make the line sound awesome from the start. I can give two stars for that. 2. The visuals - By God, the visuals are outstanding. It's exciting looking at them, and there's another two stars from me. But overall, the whole movie is just predictable, it's unoriginal, and most of all, there are too many plot holes. But I do admit, when I was a kid, I did enjoy it. Now, it's kinda boring. So then, it's still something you can enjoy, but not me.

    I have a bit of a soft-spot for this movie because this is one of the movies I remember seeing in theaters during the early stage of my life. And thoroughly enjoying, although I couldn't really grasp what the story was about entirely. Which might have been a positive thing, since seeing it now the plot is actually quite dumb. It's a feel good alien invasion movie though and entertaining. If you can get past how dumb and ridiculous the direction the story takes in this one. This is probably the first movie I saw with Will Smith in it and this is probably one of the movies in his career that kick started his career. He is badass but comedic at the same time, which he is in a lot of his movies. But the first time I saw his performance, I was enthralled by his entertaining acting chops. I subplots are irrelevant, which focuses in on 3 main characters and there female loved ones during the invasion. I thought it would have been better if the story focused more on how to fight the aliens. Even the politics and how the countries work together during that situation would have been more interesting. So yeah, this is a entertaining popcorn flick and a movie that left it's mark when it came out. In another words it's not a great, intelligent movie. But for a movie that came out during the 90's it still holds up to a degree. 7.4/10

    I was going over reviews of other people for this movie and there are many watchers who did not liked it & for sure to be sure i am sure they like " revenge of Chucky" :) , OK now i just want to discuss about its excellency firstly the star-cast then its story line and then level of entertainment , this movie is a blockbuster just because it is a proper entertainer. I still remember Presidents speech " today we celebrate our independence day " and i can watch it over and over because this is a feel good movie. Jeff Goldblum & Will Smith have played their part in simply awesome manner , they look awesome together. The sequence of cigar and one liners at many places are witty as well as entertaining. Now as it is a blockbuster already i can simply say it is one cool 90s movie with excellent special effects and action sequences therefore nonetheless anybody may say anything about this movie but my personal opinion will always be - "watch it & u will not regret it" :)

    Independence Day is one of those films that virtually defines "willing suspension of disbelief". The amount of "will" involved is substantial, but taken on those terms, it can actually be an enjoyable film (though fluffy enough to stuff a mattress). I wonder why I am inclined to give more latitude in this regard to some movies than others. It's a puzzle. Armageddon occupies approximately the same stature as Independence Day, and I was more than willing to be savagely dismissive of the former, whereas the latter gets a much more cushioned clubbing. Both films suffer from essentially the same maladies, cartoonish, one-dimensional characters, enough action-movie clich&eacute;s to choke a hippo, and plot holes larger than the spaceships themselves (which are pretty f-king huge.) These spaceships (which appear to be about a mile or so in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion and no apparent way of staying in the air--more on that in a moment) appear one morning over the major capitals of the world and... well, do nothing. Circling F16s, radio greetings and cute halter-clad teenage girls holding up "Welcome to Earth" signs garner no response. But David Levinson, a rogue scientist played by a suitably befuddled Jeff Goldblum, detects a synchronized radio pulse linking all the ships together and realizes that they are counting down to... something. Something pretty sinister, he assumes. Turns out to be true. The aliens, it seems, are bent on destroying humanity and taking over the planet. The aliens unleash their weaponry, destroying many of the earth's major cities and all seems lost, until Levinson and cocky air force pilot Steven Hiller, played by Will Smith, hatch a plan to pilot a captured alien saucer to the "mothership" in orbit around earth and disable the master computer system coordinating the attack. Plot holes and other absurdities abound. IMDb lists almost two hundred "goofs" for this film (which must be near the record, I would think.) Anachronisms, plot holes, character errors, audio-video unsynchronized, continuity errors, crew/equipment visible, errors in geography, factual errors and revealing mistakes all indicate that this is something rather less than high art, as a work of cinematic craftsmanship. MAJOR SPOILER FOLLOWS: By far the biggest plot hole is nothing less than the central plot device by which we earthlings defeat the supposedly technologically far superior aliens. Goldblum and Smith commandeer a two-person alien saucer (this is the one that crash-landed in Roswell New Mexico in 1947 and has been in storage at Area 51 ever since, according to the film) and fly it to the alien mothership. There they upload a computer virus into the mothership's main computer system, thus disabling the entire alien attack. Bear in mind that a computer virus is really just a computer program like any other, the only difference being that a virus is deliberately designed to do something nasty (to be completely technically accurate, it's unclear whether the program in question is really a "virus." A computer virus a program designed to self-replicate and spread to other connected systems, hence the name. The "virus" in the movie is certainly an example of "malware". Does it self-replicate and spread? Unclear.) The point is, to write a virus requires not only a thorough knowledge of the system it is to run on (so you know which vulnerabilities to exploit,) but also an ability to program in a language that system understands. A program written for a PC will not run on a Mac, and a program written for Linux likely won't run on either. Okay yes, that's not entirely accurate; but I'm trying to make a broader point here, that being: what are the odds that someone could write a program that would run on a computer system designed by ALIENS? Or use the appropriate communication protocol to upload it? Do the aliens use TCP/IP? What are the odds that any malware could, within seconds, completely disable an entire multi-node command and control system for an whole fleet of spaceships? Oh, and in a blatant example of product placement, the laptop used to upload the virus is a Macbook. Good thing the aliens use Apple computers too, huh? END OF SPOILER So,why do I hang onto this movie (yes, I do own it) and actually give is a decent rating? Because actually, it's rather fun. Yes, it's stupid, juvenile, ineptly made, ridiculously plotted and acted, and contains more holes than Swiss cheese, but taken on its own terms (one could almost call it camp), it's really quite an amusing couple of hours. Some of the shots of the alien mothership are actually kind of cool, too. Watch for Brent Spiner (Data on Star Trek TNG) as a quirky, neurotic Area 51 scientist who's been in the lab so long he has no idea relate to actual humans. Oh, and just how DO these spaceships stay in the air? One can assume they must weigh an awful lot, but they are able to float like soap bubbles above our biggest cities without doing any damage. Simple physics, i.e. Newton's Second Law of Motion, would demand that some sort of downward force be required to support all that weight. In physics terms, there would be no difference between supporting the ship's weight in the air, or on the ground, and that downward force would be borne by whatever is underneath. Even some sort of "levitation beam" would still need something to push against, and that something would be the ground below. In reality, the saucers wouldn't need to deploy their "primary weapon"... the weight of the spaceships alone would crush the entire city beneath them. I suppose you could argue that a sufficiently advanced alien civilization could have mastered some sort of anti-gravity technology, thereby nullifying the Earth's gravitational field in the vicinity of the ships. Maybe so. I rather think Einstein would have something to say about that. I know: nitpicky.

These spaceships (which appear to be about a mile or so in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion and no apparent way of staying in the air--more on that in a moment) appear one morning over the major capitals of the world and... well, do nothing. Circling F16s, radio greetings and cute halter-clad teenage girls holding up "Welcome to Earth" signs garner no response. But David Levinson, a rogue scientist played by a suitably befuddled Jeff Goldblum, detects a synchronized radio pulse linking all the ships together and realizes that they are counting down to... something. Something pretty sinister, he assumes. Turns out to be true. The aliens, it seems, are bent on destroying humanity and taking over the planet. The aliens unleash their weaponry, destroying many of the earth's major cities and all seems lost, until Levinson and cocky air force pilot Steven Hiller, played by Will Smith, hatch a plan to pilot a captured alien saucer to the "mothership" in orbit around earth and disable the master computer system coordinating the attack. Plot holes and other absurdities abound. IMDb lists almost two hundred "goofs" for this film (which must be near the record, I would think.) Anachronisms, plot holes, character errors, audio-video unsynchronized, continuity errors, crew/equipment visible, errors in geography, factual errors and revealing mistakes all indicate that this is something rather less than high art, as a work of cinematic craftsmanship. MAJOR SPOILER FOLLOWS: By far the biggest plot hole is nothing less than the central plot device by which we earthlings defeat the supposedly technologically far superior aliens. Goldblum and Smith commandeer a two-person alien saucer (this is the one that crash-landed in Roswell New Mexico in 1947 and has been in storage at Area 51 ever since, according to the film) and fly it to the alien mothership. There they upload a computer virus into the mothership's main computer system, thus disabling the entire alien attack. Bear in mind that a computer virus is really just a computer program like any other, the only difference being that a virus is deliberately designed to do something nasty (to be completely technically accurate, it's unclear whether the program in question is really a "virus." A computer virus a program designed to self-replicate and spread to other connected systems, hence the name. The "virus" in the movie is certainly an example of "malware". Does it self-replicate and spread? Unclear.) The point is, to write a virus requires not only a thorough knowledge of the system it is to run on (so you know which vulnerabilities to exploit,) but also an ability to program in a language that system understands. A program written for a PC will not run on a Mac, and a program written for Linux likely won't run on either. Okay yes, that's not entirely accurate; but I'm trying to make a broader point here, that being: what are the odds that someone could write a program that would run on a computer system designed by ALIENS? Or use the appropriate communication protocol to upload it? Do the aliens use TCP/IP? What are the odds that any malware could, within seconds, completely disable an entire multi-node command and control system for an whole fleet of spaceships? Oh, and in a blatant example of product placement, the laptop used to upload the virus is a Macbook. Good thing the aliens use Apple computers too, huh? END OF SPOILER So,why do I hang onto this movie (yes, I do own it) and actually give is a decent rating? Because actually, it's rather fun. Yes, it's stupid, juvenile, ineptly made, ridiculously plotted and acted, and contains more holes than Swiss cheese, but taken on its own terms (one could almost call it camp), it's really quite an amusing couple of hours. Some of the shots of the alien mothership are actually kind of cool, too. Watch for Brent Spiner (Data on Star Trek TNG) as a quirky, neurotic Area 51 scientist who's been in the lab so long he has no idea relate to actual humans. Oh, and just how DO these spaceships stay in the air? One can assume they must weigh an awful lot, but they are able to float like soap bubbles above our biggest cities without doing any damage. Simple physics, i.e. Newton's Second Law of Motion, would demand that some sort of downward force be required to support all that weight. In physics terms, there would be no difference between supporting the ship's weight in the air, or on the ground, and that downward force would be borne by whatever is underneath. Even some sort of "levitation beam" would still need something to push against, and that something would be the ground below. In reality, the saucers wouldn't need to deploy their "primary weapon"... the weight of the spaceships alone would crush the entire city beneath them. I suppose you could argue that a sufficiently advanced alien civilization could have mastered some sort of anti-gravity technology, thereby nullifying the Earth's gravitational field in the vicinity of the ships. Maybe so. I rather think Einstein would have something to say about that. I know: nitpicky.

    Roland Emmerich directed this blockbuster hit about an alien invasion of Earth arriving just in time for the American Independence day celebrations. Jeff Goldblum stars as a brilliant computer specialist who has figured out the aliens' plan of attack, and tries to warn his ex-wife(played by Margaret Colin) who just by coincidence works in the White House for the President(Bill Pullman) Randy Quaid plays a drunken crop duster who was once abducted by a UFO, and sobers up to help lead the climatic assault against the mother ship, after much of the Earth has been decimated by alien attacks. Contrived and dumb film is still watchable on a popcorn level, and the climax is exciting, but if you want to see this sort of thing done right, watch Kenneth Johnson's "V" TV films instead. Nice that "The X-Files" gets a mention though!

    I watched both movies as a teenager and I found them both horrendous. I didn't know at the time that they were made by the same director, Roland Emmerich. Now, as an adult, I can certainly affirm that this director must be one of the worse influences the movie industry ever saw. Anyone spending the amount of money in making the type of movies he does and using it for repeating the same shallow clich&eacute;s over and over doesn't even deserve to be behind a camera. Granted, this guy is a goldmine for the industry. Indeed, most people just care about what this director offers: brainless action with a lot of explosions. So, perhaps, it's not the director fault after all... Hm, no, after reading again the titles this man spawned, I can only say GUILTY, before my eyes start to bleed. Emmerich, use your budget to save the Earth for real instead of destroying it over and over again (in fiction and with the waste of resources you use for the rubbish you direct).

    Roland Emmerich blows up lots of stuff. This isn't deep. Sure the computer virus idea is stupid. Who Cares? Will Smith is fighter pilot Captain Steven Hiller who takes on the aliens. Bill Pullman is President Thomas J. Whitmore and we get to see the White House blow up. Jeff Goldblum is the math genius David Levinson who comes up with the silly computer virus to take down the alien shield. It is an iconic picture. It is seen as the pinnacle of blow 'em up popcorn summer movie. With all the destruction, how could you possibly top that.

    Not sure I'd walk across the street for a free screening of a new Roland Emmerich movie these days, but boy he came out of the gate with some funif derivativepopcorn entertainment; 'Universal Soldier', 'Stargate' and 'Independence Day'. I hadn't seen the latter in probably a decade, so when I saw it peeking out of the morass that is the $5 DVD bin at my local Wal-Mart, I bit. Like when I went to my 20 year high school reunion last year, I expected the years to be unkind to the likes of Steven Hiller, David Levinson and President Whitmore, but to my surprise they looked better than ever. Maybe it was nostalgia (aka - Mental Botox), but I enjoyed every minute of this movie. Corny? Oh sure. Holes in its logic? A few (dozen). But it was *fun*. There was no naval gazing, no gray areas, just good old fashioned cheerful heroics. Not sure a sequel could be anything but a huge let down, but I'll be there opening day, popcorn in hand.

    Americans are mere days away from another festive Fourth of July celebration when a huge alien spaceship is detected near Earth's moon. From a secretive location in New Mexico (hint, hint!), the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute" (S.E.T.I.) informs the US Pentagon. No surprise if you're watching; of course, you already know we're on the verge of a massive alien attack. And, if they're attacking, we can safely assume they are unfriendly. The mystery about why they're here is explained, briefly, but it doesn't really matter why they're here - what matters is if and how we are to get rid of them... The task falls on the eight shoulders of four men, all Americans. They will have to save the world from whatever the aliens have up their sleeves, or whatever they're wearing on this visit... Our heroes are: youthful President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman), computer technician David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), drunken crop-duster Russell Casse (Randy Quaid) and cocky pilot Steven Hiller (Will Smith). All of these people, and the majority of those supporting them, are caricatures. A few could take their act directly into a parody of this film, without changing a thing. And, there is nothing imaginative or clever about the story, which adds up to less than the obvious sources it borrows from. We are left with a "feel good" message of diversity in the United States, and some striking special effect images. ***** Independence Day (6/25/96) Roland Emmerich ~ Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Randy Quaid

    Having watched this twice - once shortly after release and again last night - all I'm left with Is memories of cringing embarrassment.Flag- waving,'good old US of A' types will love It,everyone else will squirm In their seats. Basically,Invading Aliens are thwarted by Will Smith. But wait - Is that REALLY the American president flying a Jet-fighter and saving the Earth? What a guy!(What a joke more like!). In fact,I'm not sure which premise Is the most ludicrous - the president-cum-fighter pilot or the crop-spraying fighter-pilot. Yes,you heard right - a middle-aged,alcoholic crop-sprayer who's only ever flown a Cessna becomes a Tee-total,stone-cold sober Jet-fighter Ace pilot In....wait for It...two hours!Even If we put reality on hold for a while and pretend that the difference between a light Aircraft and a fighter- 'plane ISN'T like comparing a hedge trimmer to a combine harvester,we then need to get our heads around a hopeless drunk becoming totally drink free AND sober In literally a couple of hours IN ADDITION to his crash-course In fighter pilot training! What an absolute load of garbage! The special effects are quite good,there's no doubt about that,but the 'Mega-cliched' storyline Is sickening. Even the pre-schoolers will be baffled by this one. If you'r a 'Gung-Ho',flag-waving yank,you may just manage to watch this movie with tongue firmly In cheek,but weather you can do so without flushing with embarrassment Is another matter. Everyone else over the age of three will be hard-pressed to take It even a little seriously. If the script had been changed a little to make this a comedy,I'd have liked It. But It wasn't.And I didn't.

    I can't believe it. I hate this movie the same reason the Nostalgia Critic hated it. It's clich&eacute;d, the dialogue is too common or taken from another movie, and what the hell is this? I do admit, there are a few things I can comment that somewhat save it. 1. Will Smith - The guy is awesome. His lines are terrible, but he can kinda save it because it's the king of awesome, Will Smith. But because it's Will Smith in the role, he can make the line sound awesome from the start. I can give two stars for that. 2. The visuals - By God, the visuals are outstanding. It's exciting looking at them, and there's another two stars from me. But overall, the whole movie is just predictable, it's unoriginal, and most of all, there are too many plot holes. But I do admit, when I was a kid, I did enjoy it. Now, it's kinda boring. So then, it's still something you can enjoy, but not me.

    I have a bit of a soft-spot for this movie because this is one of the movies I remember seeing in theaters during the early stage of my life. And thoroughly enjoying, although I couldn't really grasp what the story was about entirely. Which might have been a positive thing, since seeing it now the plot is actually quite dumb. It's a feel good alien invasion movie though and entertaining. If you can get past how dumb and ridiculous the direction the story takes in this one. This is probably the first movie I saw with Will Smith in it and this is probably one of the movies in his career that kick started his career. He is badass but comedic at the same time, which he is in a lot of his movies. But the first time I saw his performance, I was enthralled by his entertaining acting chops. I subplots are irrelevant, which focuses in on 3 main characters and there female loved ones during the invasion. I thought it would have been better if the story focused more on how to fight the aliens. Even the politics and how the countries work together during that situation would have been more interesting. So yeah, this is a entertaining popcorn flick and a movie that left it's mark when it came out. In another words it's not a great, intelligent movie. But for a movie that came out during the 90's it still holds up to a degree. 7.4/10

    I was going over reviews of other people for this movie and there are many watchers who did not liked it & for sure to be sure i am sure they like " revenge of Chucky" :) , OK now i just want to discuss about its excellency firstly the star-cast then its story line and then level of entertainment , this movie is a blockbuster just because it is a proper entertainer. I still remember Presidents speech " today we celebrate our independence day " and i can watch it over and over because this is a feel good movie. Jeff Goldblum & Will Smith have played their part in simply awesome manner , they look awesome together. The sequence of cigar and one liners at many places are witty as well as entertaining. Now as it is a blockbuster already i can simply say it is one cool 90s movie with excellent special effects and action sequences therefore nonetheless anybody may say anything about this movie but my personal opinion will always be - "watch it & u will not regret it" :)

    Independence Day is one of those films that virtually defines "willing suspension of disbelief". The amount of "will" involved is substantial, but taken on those terms, it can actually be an enjoyable film (though fluffy enough to stuff a mattress). I wonder why I am inclined to give more latitude in this regard to some movies than others. It's a puzzle. Armageddon occupies approximately the same stature as Independence Day, and I was more than willing to be savagely dismissive of the former, whereas the latter gets a much more cushioned clubbing. Both films suffer from essentially the same maladies, cartoonish, one-dimensional characters, enough action-movie clich&eacute;s to choke a hippo, and plot holes larger than the spaceships themselves (which are pretty f-king huge.) These spaceships (which appear to be about a mile or so in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion and no apparent way of staying in the air--more on that in a moment) appear one morning over the major capitals of the world and... well, do nothing. Circling F16s, radio greetings and cute halter-clad teenage girls holding up "Welcome to Earth" signs garner no response.

    I can't believe it. I hate this movie the same reason the Nostalgia Critic hated it. It's clich&eacute;d, the dialogue is too common or taken from another movie, and what the hell is this? I do admit, there are a few things I can comment that somewhat save it. 1. Will Smith - The guy is awesome. His lines are terrible, but he can kinda save it because it's the king of awesome, Will Smith. But because it's Will Smith in the role, he can make the line sound awesome from the start. I can give two stars for that. 2. The visuals - By God, the visuals are outstanding. It's exciting looking at them, and there's another two stars from me. But overall, the whole movie is just predictable, it's unoriginal, and most of all, there are too many plot holes. But I do admit, when I was a kid, I did enjoy it. Now, it's kinda boring. So then, it's still something you can enjoy, but not me.

    I have a bit of a soft-spot for this movie because this is one of the movies I remember seeing in theaters during the early stage of my life. And thoroughly enjoying, although I couldn't really grasp what the story was about entirely. Which might have been a positive thing, since seeing it now the plot is actually quite dumb. It's a feel good alien invasion movie though and entertaining. If you can get past how dumb and ridiculous the direction the story takes in this one. This is probably the first movie I saw with Will Smith in it and this is probably one of the movies in his career that kick started his career. He is badass but comedic at the same time, which he is in a lot of his movies. But the first time I saw his performance, I was enthralled by his entertaining acting chops. I subplots are irrelevant, which focuses in on 3 main characters and there female loved ones during the invasion. I thought it would have been better if the story focused more on how to fight the aliens. Even the politics and how the countries work together during that situation would have been more interesting. So yeah, this is a entertaining popcorn flick and a movie that left it's mark when it came out. In another words it's not a great, intelligent movie. But for a movie that came out during the 90's it still holds up to a degree. 7.4/10

    I was going over reviews of other people for this movie and there are many watchers who did not liked it & for sure to be sure i am sure they like " revenge of Chucky" :) , OK now i just want to discuss about its excellency firstly the star-cast then its story line and then level of entertainment , this movie is a blockbuster just because it is a proper entertainer. I still remember Presidents speech " today we celebrate our independence day " and i can watch it over and over because this is a feel good movie. Jeff Goldblum & Will Smith have played their part in simply awesome manner , they look awesome together. The sequence of cigar and one liners at many places are witty as well as entertaining. Now as it is a blockbuster already i can simply say it is one cool 90s movie with excellent special effects and action sequences therefore nonetheless anybody may say anything about this movie but my personal opinion will always be - "watch it & u will not regret it" :)

    Independence Day is one of those films that virtually defines "willing suspension of disbelief". The amount of "will" involved is substantial, but taken on those terms, it can actually be an enjoyable film (though fluffy enough to stuff a mattress). I wonder why I am inclined to give more latitude in this regard to some movies than others. It's a puzzle. Armageddon occupies approximately the same stature as Independence Day, and I was more than willing to be savagely dismissive of the former, whereas the latter gets a much more cushioned clubbing. Both films suffer from essentially the same maladies, cartoonish, one-dimensional characters, enough action-movie clich&eacute;s to choke a hippo, and plot holes larger than the spaceships themselves (which are pretty f-king huge.) These spaceships (which appear to be about a mile or so in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion and no apparent way of staying in the air--more on that in a moment) appear one morning over the major capitals of the world and... well, do nothing. Circling F16s, radio greetings and cute halter-clad teenage girls holding up "Welcome to Earth" signs garner no response. But David Levinson, a rogue scientist played by a suitably befuddled Jeff Goldblum, detects a synchronized radio pulse linking all the ships together and realizes that they are counting down to... something. Something pretty sinister, he assumes. Turns out to be true. The aliens, it seems, are bent on destroying humanity and taking over the planet. The aliens unleash their weaponry, destroying many of the earth's major cities and all seems lost, until Levinson and cocky air force pilot Steven Hiller, played by Will Smith, hatch a plan to pilot a captured alien saucer to the "mothership" in orbit around earth and disable the master computer system coordinating the attack. Plot holes and other absurdities abound. IMDb lists almost two hundred "goofs" for this film (which must be near the record, I would think.) Anachronisms, plot holes, character errors, audio-video unsynchronized, continuity errors, crew/equipment visible, errors in geography, factual errors and revealing mistakes all indicate that this is something rather less than high art, as a work of cinematic craftsmanship. MAJOR SPOILER FOLLOWS: By far the biggest plot hole is nothing less than the central plot device by which we earthlings defeat the supposedly technologically far superior aliens. Goldblum and Smith commandeer a two-person alien saucer (this is the one that crash-landed in Roswell New Mexico in 1947 and has been in storage at Area 51 ever since, according to the film) and fly it to the alien mothership. There they upload a computer virus into the mothership's main computer system, thus disabling the entire alien attack. Bear in mind that a computer virus is really just a computer program like any other, the only difference being that a virus is deliberately designed to do something nasty (to be completely technically accurate, it's unclear whether the program in question is really a "virus." A computer virus a program designed to self-replicate and spread to other connected systems, hence the name. The "virus" in the movie is certainly an example of "malware". Does it self-replicate and spread? Unclear.) The point is, to write a virus requires not only a thorough knowledge of the system it is to run on (so you know which vulnerabilities to exploit,) but also an ability to program in a language that system understands. A program written for a PC will not run on a Mac, and a program written for Linux likely won't run on either. Okay yes, that's not entirely accurate; but I'm trying to make a broader point here, that being: what are the odds that someone could write a program that would run on a computer system designed by ALIENS? Or use the appropriate communication protocol to upload it? Do the aliens use TCP/IP? What are the odds that any malware could, within seconds, completely disable an entire multi-node command and control system for an whole fleet of spaceships? Oh, and in a blatant example of product placement, the laptop used to upload the virus is a Macbook. Good thing the aliens use Apple computers too, huh? END OF SPOILER So,why do I hang onto this movie (yes, I do own it) and actually give is a decent rating? Because actually, it's rather fun. Yes, it's stupid, juvenile, ineptly made, ridiculously plotted and acted, and contains more holes than Swiss cheese, but taken on its own terms (one could almost call it camp), it's really quite an amusing couple of hours. Some of the shots of the alien mothership are actually kind of cool, too. Watch for Brent Spiner (Data on Star Trek TNG) as a quirky, neurotic Area 51 scientist who's been in the lab so long he has no idea relate to actual humans. Oh, and just how DO these spaceships stay in the air? One can assume they must weigh an awful lot, but they are able to float like soap bubbles above our biggest cities without doing any damage. Simple physics, i.e. Newton's Second Law of Motion, would demand that some sort of downward force be required to support all that weight. In physics terms, there would be no difference between supporting the ship's weight in the air, or on the ground, and that downward force would be borne by whatever is underneath. Even some sort of "levitation beam" would still need something to push against, and that something would be the ground below. In reality, the saucers wouldn't need to deploy their "primary weapon"... the weight of the spaceships alone would crush the entire city beneath them. I suppose you could argue that a sufficiently advanced alien civilization could have mastered some sort of anti-gravity technology, thereby nullifying the Earth's gravitational field in the vicinity of the ships. Maybe so. I rather think Einstein would have something to say about that. I know: nitpicky.

    Roland Emmerich directed this blockbuster hit about an alien invasion of Earth arriving just in time for the American Independence day celebrations. Jeff Goldblum stars as a brilliant computer specialist who has figured out the aliens' plan of attack, and tries to warn his ex-wife(played by Margaret Colin) who just by coincidence works in the White House for the President(Bill Pullman) Randy Quaid plays a drunken crop duster who was once abducted by a UFO, and sobers up to help lead the climatic assault against the mother ship, after much of the Earth has been decimated by alien attacks. Contrived and dumb film is still watchable on a popcorn level, and the climax is exciting, but if you want to see this sort of thing done right, watch Kenneth Johnson's "V" TV films instead. Nice that "The X-Files" gets a mention though!

    I watched both movies as a teenager and I found them both horrendous. I didn't know at the time that they were made by the same director, Roland Emmerich. Now, as an adult, I can certainly affirm that this director must be one of the worse influences the movie industry ever saw. Anyone spending the amount of money in making the type of movies he does and using it for repeating the same shallow clich&eacute;s over and over doesn't even deserve to be behind a camera. Granted, this guy is a goldmine for the industry. Indeed, most people just care about what this director offers: brainless action with a lot of explosions. So, perhaps, it's not the director fault after all... Hm, no, after reading again the titles this man spawned, I can only say GUILTY, before my eyes start to bleed. Emmerich, use your budget to save the Earth for real instead of destroying it over and over again (in fiction and with the waste of resources you use for the rubbish you direct).

    Roland Emmerich blows up lots of stuff. This isn't deep. Sure the computer virus idea is stupid. Who Cares? Will Smith is fighter pilot Captain Steven Hiller who takes on the aliens. Bill Pullman is President Thomas J. Whitmore and we get to see the White House blow up. Jeff Goldblum is the math genius David Levinson who comes up with the silly computer virus to take down the alien shield. It is an iconic picture. It is seen as the pinnacle of blow 'em up popcorn summer movie. With all the destruction, how could you possibly top that.

    Not sure I'd walk across the street for a free screening of a new Roland Emmerich movie these days, but boy he came out of the gate with some funif derivativepopcorn entertainment; 'Universal Soldier', 'Stargate' and 'Independence Day'. I hadn't seen the latter in probably a decade, so when I saw it peeking out of the morass that is the $5 DVD bin at my local Wal-Mart, I bit. Like when I went to my 20 year high school reunion last year, I expected the years to be unkind to the likes of Steven Hiller, David Levinson and President Whitmore, but to my surprise they looked better than ever. Maybe it was nostalgia (aka - Mental Botox), but I enjoyed every minute of this movie. Corny? Oh sure. Holes in its logic? A few (dozen). But it was *fun*. There was no naval gazing, no gray areas, just good old fashioned cheerful heroics. Not sure a sequel could be anything but a huge let down, but I'll be there opening day, popcorn in hand.

    Americans are mere days away from another festive Fourth of July celebration when a huge alien spaceship is detected near Earth's moon. From a secretive location in New Mexico (hint, hint!), the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute" (S.E.T.I.) informs the US Pentagon. No surprise if you're watching; of course, you already know we're on the verge of a massive alien attack. And, if they're attacking, we can safely assume they are unfriendly. The mystery about why they're here is explained, briefly, but it doesn't really matter why they're here - what matters is if and how we are to get rid of them... The task falls on the eight shoulders of four men, all Americans. They will have to save the world from whatever the aliens have up their sleeves, or whatever they're wearing on this visit... Our heroes are: youthful President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman), computer technician David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), drunken crop-duster Russell Casse (Randy Quaid) and cocky pilot Steven Hiller (Will Smith). All of these people, and the majority of those supporting them, are caricatures. A few could take their act directly into a parody of this film, without changing a thing. And, there is nothing imaginative or clever about the story, which adds up to less than the obvious sources it borrows from. We are left with a "feel good" message of diversity in the United States, and some striking special effect images. ***** Independence Day (6/25/96) Roland Emmerich ~ Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Randy Quaid

    Having watched this twice - once shortly after release and again last night - all I'm left with Is memories of cringing embarrassment.Flag- waving,'good old US of A' types will love It,everyone else will squirm In their seats. Basically,Invading Aliens are thwarted by Will Smith. But wait - Is that REALLY the American president flying a Jet-fighter and saving the Earth? What a guy!(What a joke more like!). In fact,I'm not sure which premise Is the most ludicrous - the president-cum-fighter pilot or the crop-spraying fighter-pilot. Yes,you heard right - a middle-aged,alcoholic crop-sprayer who's only ever flown a Cessna becomes a Tee-total,stone-cold sober Jet-fighter Ace pilot In....wait for It...two hours!Even If we put reality on hold for a while and pretend that the difference between a light Aircraft and a fighter- 'plane ISN'T like comparing a hedge trimmer to a combine harvester,we then need to get our heads around a hopeless drunk becoming totally drink free AND sober In literally a couple of hours IN ADDITION to his crash-course In fighter pilot training! What an absolute load of garbage! The special effects are quite good,there's no doubt about that,but the 'Mega-cliched' storyline Is sickening. Even the pre-schoolers will be baffled by this one. If you'r a 'Gung-Ho',flag-waving yank,you may just manage to watch this movie with tongue firmly In cheek,but weather you can do so without flushing with embarrassment Is another matter. Everyone else over the age of three will be hard-pressed to take It even a little seriously. If the script had been changed a little to make this a comedy,I'd have liked It. But It wasn't.And I didn't.
