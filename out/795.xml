    A glossily bland adaptation of the comic in which Macaulay Culkin is perfectly cast as the richest kid in the world. He has to save both his fortune and his family from the evil schemes of John Larroquette, with the help of his pals and his butler. This was never going to be a masterpiece, was it? There are some likable performances here and there - Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole as Richie's parents, Stephi Lineberg as one of the kids, Jonathan Hyde as Cadbury - but the gags are so leaden and the dialogue so terminally banal that they all struggle to breathe life into the proceedings. The writers seem to think that a rich kid being rich is novelty enough to sustain the film, which it isn't, and that having a posh English butler say things like 'Let's kick some butt' is comedy gold, which it isn't. Meanwhile Laroquette's plan of child murder, terrorism and faked suicides hardly sits well with the inconsequential, hollow tone of the rest of the movie.

    Richie Rich stars the charismatic, easily-lovable Macaulay Culkin in a role that basically begged for him from the first day of pre-production. Unfortunately, nothing else begged much attention in terms of how Richie Rich conducts itself as a piece of family entertainment. Is it serviceable? Absolutely. Just prepare for a rather long and tedious ninety-four minutes. Kids will appreciate it, seeing their favorite hero from Home Alone getting into more hairy little circumstances, but the true victims, the parents, will likely be contemplating better things they could be doing with their time. Make no mistake; I was enjoying Richie Rich for about forty-five minutes on a simply, passable level. Then at the hour mark, I grew restless, and by the finale, I was shaking my head at the missed opportunity the film could've capitalized on. I'll come back to this later. The story is inspired from the comic-book character who made quite the name for himself in books and strips that I never found myself reading. He is played by Macaulay Culkin, who was born to Richard and Regina Rich (Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole), a couple worth a dollar over $70 billion thanks to their immensely successful Rich Industries. The three live in a house that appears to be sitting two full-size golf courses, and embrace their wealthy status in the way of philanthropy, and not personal narcissism. While Richie enjoys living a lavish life, traveling in helicopters, playing basketball in doors, and carrying thousand-dollar bills in his wallet, he greatly envies the lives of regular, middle-class children, who have very little priorities and can spend their days playing baseball in an open sandlot. With this kind of setup, you'd think the film would be on the track of setting up a "lonely rich boy" sort of moral, emphasizing that all the money in the world can't buy true, wholesome companionship, right? Well, just as we're about to further dive into that, a pesky plot point involving corruption, attempted-murder, and industry takeover begins to plague the Rich family, and with rumor that his parents are dead after a nice pack of TNT was on their private plane, Richie assumes the role as the CEO of the company. But just as we're about to go further into that detail, we focus on one of Richard Rich's employees, who tried to murder the couple and their kid to take over Rich Industries for himself. Not if Richie and his loyal butler Herbert Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde) can help it, though. Right off the bat, we just passed up two solid directions this film could've taken instead of the contrived, foreseeable one it settled on. Yet if there's one thing that can't be overlooked about this film, it's the abundance of character-actors, who all do a capable job of doing what they can with what they have - especially Macaulay Culkin. Culkin's gifted, easy-going performance makes one sad that this was his last "big" film as a child actor, before landing roles in several under-performing independent films before fading into tabloid obscurity. Co-writer of Richie Rich Neil Tolkin worked on License to Drive, a potent, lively comedy about a teen and his two friends going out after hours in his grandfather's Cadillac even after failing his driver's test. After that, he settled for very little doing both Richie Rich and the atrocious Pauly Shore comedy Jury Duty a year later. When glancing through director Donald Petrie's filmography, it appears that he has made a career out of making spur-of-the-moment comedies that usually do fairly well at the box office before becoming safe-bets on cable. He has a formula and he should stick to it. It's just sort of upsetting that Richie Rich aspires to be functional, rather than successful. Starring: Macaulay Culkin, Edward Herrmann, Christine Ebersole, Jonathan Hyde, and John Larroquette. Directed by: Donald Petrie.

    Anybody who thinks "Castaway" or "The Book of Eli" go overboard in regards to their levels of product placement needs to see "Richie Rich" immediately. While not nearly as pernicious as the film "Mac and Me," this obnoxious feature-length commercial contains a shockingly high level of product placement, right down to the very core of the film. There are *characters* in this film named after products (ie. "Cadbury" the Butler). McDonald's product-placement is certainly not lacking in the film. Kids enter a McDonald's in one scene and look around in awe and wonder. Gee, that's subtle. There's a part where Christine Ebersole (also in "Mac and Me!") says "...and this little pack of *Bubblicious.* *Richie's favorite.*" like no human on Earth would ever speak. I suppose it wouldn't matter as much if the film had a story, as it unfortunately doesn't, but it sure makes it devoid of any integrity (as if any was, indeed, possible). Something about John Larroquette wanting to take over the company, industrial espionage, Culkin carrying out more "Home Alone" gags, weird James Bond gadgets (toy marketing?), Johnathan Hyde in a gay S&M leather outfit, yawn, yawn. Also, Rich and his family are apparently the richest on Earth, with a fortune in excess of $70 billion, yet it is never actually explained why (at least from what I can remember). The reason why they're rich is the entire crux of the story; without an explanation, Larroquette's motivation, or scheme, makes no sense, and the entire plot crumbles as a result. It's like watching a version of "Pirates of Silicon Valley" that doesn't involve any computers. Ugh. Am I simply supposed to buy the fact that they're rich just because they have all that money? Sorry, I don't. I've never read the comic book, so I can't attest to whether it's the same or not. Culkin sleepwalks through the film, having obviously become bored with acting. Avoid.

    I didn't absolutely hate Richie Rich, but for me it wasn't that great either. As usual, there were some good things, but some not so good things as well. THE GOOD THINGS: 1) Macaulay Culkin, personally I think he is better an actor than people give him credit for. He is one of the main reasons why I love the first two Home Alone movies so much. Here, he gives a very spirited lead performance, admittedly not as cute as he was when he was starring in underrated gems like Uncle Buck, but he shows once again what a talented actor he was. 2) Jonathan Hyde as the butler comes very close to stealing the show, a very funny and sly performance. Also Edward Hermann and Christine Ebersole give humorous performances, while John Larroquette plays the villain of the piece more than adequately. 3) The scenery is quite impressive, captured well by the breezy cinematography. The Biltmore estate was gorgeous. 4) The soundtrack was decent, nice background music especially. 5) I liked the moral the film taught; All the money in the world can't make you happy, thinking about it that is true. THE NOT SO GOOD THINGS: 1) While I liked the moral of the film, the story itself is predictable and somewhat contrived. it probably doesn't help you have seen it all before. 2) The script is quite weak in general. Don't get me wrong there were some good spots like "Oh my god I look like Michael Jackson!" but the jokes are admittedly very silly and juvenile, and the scripting does fall in the danger of becoming clich&eacute;d. 3) The pacing. Now I don't mind films that move fast. I do have more of a problem if the pacing is TOO fast, despite the feel good nature of the film, and its valiant attempt to rise above superficial material, the film feels a little too rushed, the ending particularly felt skimmed over. 4) The characters feel rather stereotypical. Maybe that is an unfair complaint as it probably couldn't be avoided, but I couldn't help thinking yeah I recognise that type of character. Overall, definitely not a bad film, worth watching at least once, but I personally didn't find it that great. 5/10 Bethany Cox

    Yes, I am not a member of his fan club and for the most part I hate nearly everything he was in. My favorite scene with him is the one in "The Good Son" involving the cliff. I had a nice laugh with that one. Here there is no such scene and the film might as well be called "Home Alone 3: this time the kids rich!" as it has almost the same premise. Granted the parents did not really leave him, but rather got into an airplane crash, but it is essentially the same as that brat is in this one too. So the story is the kid is lonely and tries to make friends, parents disappear after a plane crash, some dude is trying to get all the money for himself and there is no robot like there was in the original cartoon still trying to debate if that is a bad or good thing. All I know is that the film for the most part is cringe worthy, but as I have said I can not stand Macualay at all so I am going to tend to be against anything he is in. I did not like "Uncle Buck", "Home Alone" or any of the movies he has been in. Except for said scene, ah yes plunge to your death you spoiled sack of...ahem, the only reason I give this movie a two is that there was a joke in it that actually got me to laughing involving this laser or something blowing a chunk out of a stone statue. Other than that, barf.

    In 1994, Macaulay Culkin stared in 3 films: 'Richie Rich', 'The Pagemaster' and 'Getting even with dad', none of them particularly interesting. The movies themselves did poorly at cinemas and in critical terms. In 1994, Macaulay Culkin was 13/14 years old. He was in his early adolescence, so he was growing. A difficult phase for him. Ridiculously, people began to ignore him because of that - either that or they simply thought his cuteness was disappearing and gave him little value for that. But he always proved to be a terrific actor. True, there were many, many great child actors but he was one of them for sure. Sure, his cuteness took him far, but it was his talent that made him a legend. After playing a completely different role in the 1993 film 'The Good Son' (where he played a psychopath that could very well disguise that nature thanks to his angelical looks, a wolf in sheep's clothe), he returned to the roles of 'good guys' in all of his 1994 films. 'Richie Rich' is not much of a film, but perhaps it's a little more interesting than 'The Pagemaster'. It's not a bad movie, but it's a somewhat complex film for me to give a fair rating. It has good moments but also very stupid moments, particularly from the 2nd half on (in my opinion, where the movie is at its weakest). Macaulay Culkin plays the title character. Richie Rich is rich (like his name suggests), lives in a fancy mansion surrounded by comfort and luxury and can even count with a chauffeur that takes him in his majestic and elegant Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud whenever it's necessary. But Richie realizes that there is one thing that money can't buy: happiness. He feels the lack of friends and possibly bored with his tedious life. He just wants to be like the other kids. About the things I found funny in this film, a good example of that is the line &laquo;Oh my God, I look like Michael Jackson!&raquo; by Richie's mother. Come to think of it... that's not untrue - lol. I'm surprised they put this line in the film because Macaulay Culkin stars in it and considering the friendship he had with the eccentric singer... Other funny details are, for example, the cute dog that has dollar signs instead of spots and appropriately named Dollar, and the scene when Richie doesn't wanna wake up but stares at his personal trainer when he realizes what a beauty she is (she is portrayed by the supermodel Claudia Schiffer). Macaulay Culkin had everything to be a great name of the cinema. And he was, for a few years, mostly thanks to the success of the first two 'Home Alone' films. He was talented, charismatic and good-looking. Too bad he trashed his life later, but I believe he turned out to be like this because of his personal problems.

    From director Donald Petrie (Mystic Pizza, Miss Congeniality), this is a film that probably got many kids saving their pocket money, I certainly wished I was rich. Basically Richie Rich (Razzie nominated Macaulay Culkin) is the richest kid in the world with unlimited wealth and everything he could ever want. There is one thing thing he doesn't have that he longs for, a normal life with some friends, but one day he sees some kids playing baseball and wants to join them, but they don't want him around. Richie manages to get them to like him however when he invites them to enjoy themselves to his mansion and all its luxuries, including a roller-coaster and a McDonald's restaurant. Meanwhile, Lawrence Van Dough (John Larroquette), the Rich family's executive is planning to kill the family and steal their fortune, so when Richie realises, he with his new friends and trusted English butler Herbert Arthur Runcible Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde) plan to stop him. Also starring Edward Herrmann as Richard Rich, Christine Ebersole as Regina Rich, Michael McShane as Professor Keenbean, Chelcie Ross as Ferguson, Mariangela Pino as Diane Pazinski, Stephi Lineburg as Gloria Pazinski, Michael Maccarone as Tony and Claudia Schiffer as Aerobics Instructor. It has its moments of slapstick for the kids, but it is nowhere as entertaining as Home Alone, especially with Culkin reaching the age of 14 and nearly an adolescent. Okay!

    Inspired by the popular Harvey comics comes this above average kids flick from writers Tom S. Parker and Jim Jennewein (original story by Neil Tolkin) which sees our hero "Richie Rich" having to thwart an attempt to assume control of the family fortune. The plot is hardly inspiring, yet the cast make do with it to keep young viewers reasonably entertained. The cast are hardly riveting themselves, and all do better than the precocious Culkin. Evil John Larroquette as the greedy Van Dough and butler Jonathan Hyde do well, while Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole play Richard and Regina Rich. Daniel Petrie's direction saves the film as he keeps proceedings bouncing along nicely. Tuesday, September 30, 1997 - T.V.

    I gave this movie a 7 on a scale of 1-10 because I took into consideration it is a kids movie and should be judged as such. When this movie came out I was 13 and of course I enjoyed it much more then as opposed to now but having watched it as a child and as an adult I do remember how much I enjoyed the film as a kid. From the harsh grade of a 4.4 average I assume people where comparing this to complex movies with great plots. Kids should not be subjected to nothing but adult theme. So when you grade the movie remember what audience it was desighned for.As a child I would have gave this movie a 7. Would you drive a metro and act as if it should perform like a porsche?

    While 1994 was a great year to be Green Day or The Offspring, this was not so for the young Macaulay Culkin and his fans. As a 14 year old playing the younger 12 year "richest kid in the world", Culkin and his management must have realized quickly that he could not stay a child actor forever. Richie Rich, therefore became Culkin's last major project until his return to film as a 23-year-old young adult in 2003's Party Monster. In "Rich", no actor is in top form. The laughs were too few and too far between, especially for a family comedy. The post-Jurassic Park CGI "robot bee" may have even been a hindrance rather than a creative flourish. None of the characters were developed beyond the simple caricatures we'd expect and further stripped of comedic potential. By the time the antagonist breaks into the vault, anyone over the age of 17 probably knew what was inside; that is if they hadn't already stopped paying attention and fallen asleep. Had the film starred another adolescent lead, we may have been forgiving, but the overall quality of this venture paled in comparison with the Culkin we knew from Uncle Buck, the Home Alone pictures, My Girl, and even his brief appearance in Michael Jackson's 9 minute "Black or White" rampage. Being that it was filmed in and around the Chicagoland area, and that this reviewer is a sucker for anything local, this reviewer feels generous giving Richie Rich 4 out of 10 IMDb stars.

    Yes, I am not a member of his fan club and for the most part I hate nearly everything he was in. My favorite scene with him is the one in "The Good Son" involving the cliff. I had a nice laugh with that one. Here there is no such scene and the film might as well be called "Home Alone 3: this time the kids rich!" as it has almost the same premise. Granted the parents did not really leave him, but rather got into an airplane crash, but it is essentially the same as that brat is in this one too. So the story is the kid is lonely and tries to make friends, parents disappear after a plane crash, some dude is trying to get all the money for himself and there is no robot like there was in the original cartoon still trying to debate if that is a bad or good thing. All I know is that the film for the most part is cringe worthy, but as I have said I can not stand Macualay at all so I am going to tend to be against anything he is in. I did not like "Uncle Buck", "Home Alone" or any of the movies he has been in. Except for said scene, ah yes plunge to your death you spoiled sack of...ahem, the only reason I give this movie a two is that there was a joke in it that actually got me to laughing involving this laser or something blowing a chunk out of a stone statue. Other than that, barf.

    In 1994, Macaulay Culkin stared in 3 films: 'Richie Rich', 'The Pagemaster' and 'Getting even with dad', none of them particularly interesting. The movies themselves did poorly at cinemas and in critical terms. In 1994, Macaulay Culkin was 13/14 years old. He was in his early adolescence, so he was growing. A difficult phase for him. Ridiculously, people began to ignore him because of that - either that or they simply thought his cuteness was disappearing and gave him little value for that. But he always proved to be a terrific actor. True, there were many, many great child actors but he was one of them for sure. Sure, his cuteness took him far, but it was his talent that made him a legend. After playing a completely different role in the 1993 film 'The Good Son' (where he played a psychopath that could very well disguise that nature thanks to his angelical looks, a wolf in sheep's clothe), he returned to the roles of 'good guys' in all of his 1994 films. 'Richie Rich' is not much of a film, but perhaps it's a little more interesting than 'The Pagemaster'. It's not a bad movie, but it's a somewhat complex film for me to give a fair rating. It has good moments but also very stupid moments, particularly from the 2nd half on (in my opinion, where the movie is at its weakest). Macaulay Culkin plays the title character. Richie Rich is rich (like his name suggests), lives in a fancy mansion surrounded by comfort and luxury and can even count with a chauffeur that takes him in his majestic and elegant Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud whenever it's necessary. But Richie realizes that there is one thing that money can't buy: happiness. He feels the lack of friends and possibly bored with his tedious life. He just wants to be like the other kids. About the things I found funny in this film, a good example of that is the line &laquo;Oh my God, I look like Michael Jackson!&raquo; by Richie's mother. Come to think of it... that's not untrue - lol. I'm surprised they put this line in the film because Macaulay Culkin stars in it and considering the friendship he had with the eccentric singer... Other funny details are, for example, the cute dog that has dollar signs instead of spots and appropriately named Dollar, and the scene when Richie doesn't wanna wake up but stares at his personal trainer when he realizes what a beauty she is (she is portrayed by the supermodel Claudia Schiffer). Macaulay Culkin had everything to be a great name of the cinema. And he was, for a few years, mostly thanks to the success of the first two 'Home Alone' films. He was talented, charismatic and good-looking. Too bad he trashed his life later, but I believe he turned out to be like this because of his personal problems.

    From director Donald Petrie (Mystic Pizza, Miss Congeniality), this is a film that probably got many kids saving their pocket money, I certainly wished I was rich. Basically Richie Rich (Razzie nominated Macaulay Culkin) is the richest kid in the world with unlimited wealth and everything he could ever want. There is one thing thing he doesn't have that he longs for, a normal life with some friends, but one day he sees some kids playing baseball and wants to join them, but they don't want him around. Richie manages to get them to like him however when he invites them to enjoy themselves to his mansion and all its luxuries, including a roller-coaster and a McDonald's restaurant. Meanwhile, Lawrence Van Dough (John Larroquette), the Rich family's executive is planning to kill the family and steal their fortune, so when Richie realises, he with his new friends and trusted English butler Herbert Arthur Runcible Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde) plan to stop him. Also starring Edward Herrmann as Richard Rich, Christine Ebersole as Regina Rich, Michael McShane as Professor Keenbean, Chelcie Ross as Ferguson, Mariangela Pino as Diane Pazinski, Stephi Lineburg as Gloria Pazinski, Michael Maccarone as Tony and Claudia Schiffer as Aerobics Instructor. It has its moments of slapstick for the kids, but it is nowhere as entertaining as Home Alone, especially with Culkin reaching the age of 14 and nearly an adolescent. Okay!

    Inspired by the popular Harvey comics comes this above average kids flick from writers Tom S. Parker and Jim Jennewein (original story by Neil Tolkin) which sees our hero "Richie Rich" having to thwart an attempt to assume control of the family fortune. The plot is hardly inspiring, yet the cast make do with it to keep young viewers reasonably entertained. The cast are hardly riveting themselves, and all do better than the precocious Culkin. Evil John Larroquette as the greedy Van Dough and butler Jonathan Hyde do well, while Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole play Richard and Regina Rich. Daniel Petrie's direction saves the film as he keeps proceedings bouncing along nicely. Tuesday, September 30, 1997 - T.V.

    I gave this movie a 7 on a scale of 1-10 because I took into consideration it is a kids movie and should be judged as such. When this movie came out I was 13 and of course I enjoyed it much more then as opposed to now but having watched it as a child and as an adult I do remember how much I enjoyed the film as a kid. From the harsh grade of a 4.4 average I assume people where comparing this to complex movies with great plots. Kids should not be subjected to nothing but adult theme. So when you grade the movie remember what audience it was desighned for.As a child I would have gave this movie a 7. Would you drive a metro and act as if it should perform like a porsche?

    While 1994 was a great year to be Green Day or The Offspring, this was not so for the young Macaulay Culkin and his fans. As a 14 year old playing the younger 12 year "richest kid in the world", Culkin and his management must have realized quickly that he could not stay a child actor forever. Richie Rich, therefore became Culkin's last major project until his return to film as a 23-year-old young adult in 2003's Party Monster. In "Rich", no actor is in top form. The laughs were too few and too far between, especially for a family comedy. The post-Jurassic Park CGI "robot bee" may have even been a hindrance rather than a creative flourish. None of the characters were developed beyond the simple caricatures we'd expect and further stripped of comedic potential. By the time the antagonist breaks into the vault, anyone over the age of 17 probably knew what was inside; that is if they hadn't already stopped paying attention and fallen asleep. Had the film starred another adolescent lead, we may have been forgiving, but the overall quality of this venture paled in comparison with the Culkin we knew from Uncle Buck, the Home Alone pictures, My Girl, and even his brief appearance in Michael Jackson's 9 minute "Black or White" rampage. Being that it was filmed in and around the Chicagoland area, and that this reviewer is a sucker for anything local, this reviewer feels generous giving Richie Rich 4 out of 10 IMDb stars.

    A glossily bland adaptation of the comic in which Macaulay Culkin is perfectly cast as the richest kid in the world. He has to save both his fortune and his family from the evil schemes of John Larroquette, with the help of his pals and his butler. This was never going to be a masterpiece, was it? There are some likable performances here and there - Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole as Richie's parents, Stephi Lineberg as one of the kids, Jonathan Hyde as Cadbury - but the gags are so leaden and the dialogue so terminally banal that they all struggle to breathe life into the proceedings. The writers seem to think that a rich kid being rich is novelty enough to sustain the film, which it isn't, and that having a posh English butler say things like 'Let's kick some butt' is comedy gold, which it isn't. Meanwhile Laroquette's plan of child murder, terrorism and faked suicides hardly sits well with the inconsequential, hollow tone of the rest of the movie.

    Richie Rich stars the charismatic, easily-lovable Macaulay Culkin in a role that basically begged for him from the first day of pre-production. Unfortunately, nothing else begged much attention in terms of how Richie Rich conducts itself as a piece of family entertainment. Is it serviceable? Absolutely. Just prepare for a rather long and tedious ninety-four minutes. Kids will appreciate it, seeing their favorite hero from Home Alone getting into more hairy little circumstances, but the true victims, the parents, will likely be contemplating better things they could be doing with their time. Make no mistake; I was enjoying Richie Rich for about forty-five minutes on a simply, passable level. Then at the hour mark, I grew restless, and by the finale, I was shaking my head at the missed opportunity the film could've capitalized on. I'll come back to this later. The story is inspired from the comic-book character who made quite the name for himself in books and strips that I never found myself reading. He is played by Macaulay Culkin, who was born to Richard and Regina Rich (Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole), a couple worth a dollar over $70 billion thanks to their immensely successful Rich Industries. The three live in a house that appears to be sitting two full-size golf courses, and embrace their wealthy status in the way of philanthropy, and not personal narcissism. While Richie enjoys living a lavish life, traveling in helicopters, playing basketball in doors, and carrying thousand-dollar bills in his wallet, he greatly envies the lives of regular, middle-class children, who have very little priorities and can spend their days playing baseball in an open sandlot. With this kind of setup, you'd think the film would be on the track of setting up a "lonely rich boy" sort of moral, emphasizing that all the money in the world can't buy true, wholesome companionship, right? Well, just as we're about to further dive into that, a pesky plot point involving corruption, attempted-murder, and industry takeover begins to plague the Rich family, and with rumor that his parents are dead after a nice pack of TNT was on their private plane, Richie assumes the role as the CEO of the company. But just as we're about to go further into that detail, we focus on one of Richard Rich's employees, who tried to murder the couple and their kid to take over Rich Industries for himself. Not if Richie and his loyal butler Herbert Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde) can help it, though. Right off the bat, we just passed up two solid directions this film could've taken instead of the contrived, foreseeable one it settled on. Yet if there's one thing that can't be overlooked about this film, it's the abundance of character-actors, who all do a capable job of doing what they can with what they have - especially Macaulay Culkin. Culkin's gifted, easy-going performance makes one sad that this was his last "big" film as a child actor, before landing roles in several under-performing independent films before fading into tabloid obscurity. Co-writer of Richie Rich Neil Tolkin worked on License to Drive, a potent, lively comedy about a teen and his two friends going out after hours in his grandfather's Cadillac even after failing his driver's test. After that, he settled for very little doing both Richie Rich and the atrocious Pauly Shore comedy Jury Duty a year later. When glancing through director Donald Petrie's filmography, it appears that he has made a career out of making spur-of-the-moment comedies that usually do fairly well at the box office before becoming safe-bets on cable. He has a formula and he should stick to it. It's just sort of upsetting that Richie Rich aspires to be functional, rather than successful. Starring: Macaulay Culkin, Edward Herrmann, Christine Ebersole, Jonathan Hyde, and John Larroquette. Directed by: Donald Petrie.

    Anybody who thinks "Castaway" or "The Book of Eli" go overboard in regards to their levels of product placement needs to see "Richie Rich" immediately. While not nearly as pernicious as the film "Mac and Me," this obnoxious feature-length commercial contains a shockingly high level of product placement, right down to the very core of the film. There are *characters* in this film named after products (ie. "Cadbury" the Butler). McDonald's product-placement is certainly not lacking in the film. Kids enter a McDonald's in one scene and look around in awe and wonder. Gee, that's subtle. There's a part where Christine Ebersole (also in "Mac and Me!") says "...and this little pack of *Bubblicious.* *Richie's favorite.*" like no human on Earth would ever speak. I suppose it wouldn't matter as much if the film had a story, as it unfortunately doesn't, but it sure makes it devoid of any integrity (as if any was, indeed, possible). Something about John Larroquette wanting to take over the company, industrial espionage, Culkin carrying out more "Home Alone" gags, weird James Bond gadgets (toy marketing?), Johnathan Hyde in a gay S&M leather outfit, yawn, yawn. Also, Rich and his family are apparently the richest on Earth, with a fortune in excess of $70 billion, yet it is never actually explained why (at least from what I can remember). The reason why they're rich is the entire crux of the story; without an explanation, Larroquette's motivation, or scheme, makes no sense, and the entire plot crumbles as a result. It's like watching a version of "Pirates of Silicon Valley" that doesn't involve any computers. Ugh. Am I simply supposed to buy the fact that they're rich just because they have all that money? Sorry, I don't. I've never read the comic book, so I can't attest to whether it's the same or not. Culkin sleepwalks through the film, having obviously become bored with acting. Avoid.

    I didn't absolutely hate Richie Rich, but for me it wasn't that great either. As usual, there were some good things, but some not so good things as well. THE GOOD THINGS: 1) Macaulay Culkin, personally I think he is better an actor than people give him credit for. He is one of the main reasons why I love the first two Home Alone movies so much. Here, he gives a very spirited lead performance, admittedly not as cute as he was when he was starring in underrated gems like Uncle Buck, but he shows once again what a talented actor he was. 2) Jonathan Hyde as the butler comes very close to stealing the show, a very funny and sly performance. Also Edward Hermann and Christine Ebersole give humorous performances, while John Larroquette plays the villain of the piece more than adequately. 3) The scenery is quite impressive, captured well by the breezy cinematography. The Biltmore estate was gorgeous. 4) The soundtrack was decent, nice background music especially. 5) I liked the moral the film taught; All the money in the world can't make you happy, thinking about it that is true. THE NOT SO GOOD THINGS: 1) While I liked the moral of the film, the story itself is predictable and somewhat contrived. it probably doesn't help you have seen it all before. 2) The script is quite weak in general. Don't get me wrong there were some good spots like "Oh my god I look like Michael Jackson!" but the jokes are admittedly very silly and juvenile, and the scripting does fall in the danger of becoming clich&eacute;d. 3) The pacing. Now I don't mind films that move fast. I do have more of a problem if the pacing is TOO fast, despite the feel good nature of the film, and its valiant attempt to rise above superficial material, the film feels a little too rushed, the ending particularly felt skimmed over. 4) The characters feel rather stereotypical. Maybe that is an unfair complaint as it probably couldn't be avoided, but I couldn't help thinking yeah I recognise that type of character. Overall, definitely not a bad film, worth watching at least once, but I personally didn't find it that great. 5/10 Bethany Cox

    Richie Rich stars the charismatic, easily-lovable Macaulay Culkin in a role that basically begged for him from the first day of pre-production. Unfortunately, nothing else begged much attention in terms of how Richie Rich conducts itself as a piece of family entertainment. Is it serviceable? Absolutely. Just prepare for a rather long and tedious ninety-four minutes. Kids will appreciate it, seeing their favorite hero from Home Alone getting into more hairy little circumstances, but the true victims, the parents, will likely be contemplating better things they could be doing with their time. Make no mistake; I was enjoying Richie Rich for about forty-five minutes on a simply, passable level. Then at the hour mark, I grew restless, and by the finale, I was shaking my head at the missed opportunity the film could've capitalized on. I'll come back to this later. The story is inspired from the comic-book character who made quite the name for himself in books and strips that I never found myself reading. He is played by Macaulay Culkin, who was born to Richard and Regina Rich (Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole), a couple worth a dollar over $70 billion thanks to their immensely successful Rich Industries. The three live in a house that appears to be sitting two full-size golf courses, and embrace their wealthy status in the way of philanthropy, and not personal narcissism. While Richie enjoys living a lavish life, traveling in helicopters, playing basketball in doors, and carrying thousand-dollar bills in his wallet, he greatly envies the lives of regular, middle-class children, who have very little priorities and can spend their days playing baseball in an open sandlot. With this kind of setup, you'd think the film would be on the track of setting up a "lonely rich boy" sort of moral, emphasizing that all the money in the world can't buy true, wholesome companionship, right? Well, just as we're about to further dive into that, a pesky plot point involving corruption, attempted-murder, and industry takeover begins to plague the Rich family, and with rumor that his parents are dead after a nice pack of TNT was on their private plane, Richie assumes the role as the CEO of the company. But just as we're about to go further into that detail, we focus on one of Richard Rich's employees, who tried to murder the couple and their kid to take over Rich Industries for himself. Not if Richie and his loyal butler Herbert Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde) can help it, though. Right off the bat, we just passed up two solid directions this film could've taken instead of the contrived, foreseeable one it settled on. Yet if there's one thing that can't be overlooked about this film, it's the abundance of character-actors, who all do a capable job of doing what they can with what they have - especially Macaulay Culkin. Culkin's gifted, easy-going performance makes one sad that this was his last "big" film as a child actor, before landing roles in several under-performing independent films before fading into tabloid obscurity. Co-writer of Richie Rich Neil Tolkin worked on License to Drive, a potent, lively comedy about a teen and his two friends going out after hours in his grandfather's Cadillac even after failing his driver's test. After that, he settled for very little doing both Richie Rich and the atrocious Pauly Shore comedy Jury Duty a year later. When glancing through director Donald Petrie's filmography, it appears that he has made a career out of making spur-of-the-moment comedies that usually do fairly well at the box office before becoming safe-bets on cable. He has a formula and he should stick to it. It's just sort of upsetting that Richie Rich aspires to be functional, rather than successful. Starring: Macaulay Culkin, Edward Herrmann, Christine Ebersole, Jonathan Hyde, and John Larroquette. Directed by: Donald Petrie.

    Anybody who thinks "Castaway" or "The Book of Eli" go overboard in regards to their levels of product placement needs to see "Richie Rich" immediately. While not nearly as pernicious as the film "Mac and Me," this obnoxious feature-length commercial contains a shockingly high level of product placement, right down to the very core of the film. There are *characters* in this film named after products (ie. "Cadbury" the Butler). McDonald's product-placement is certainly not lacking in the film. Kids enter a McDonald's in one scene and look around in awe and wonder. Gee, that's subtle. There's a part where Christine Ebersole (also in "Mac and Me!") says "...and this little pack of *Bubblicious.* *Richie's favorite.*" like no human on Earth would ever speak. I suppose it wouldn't matter as much if the film had a story, as it unfortunately doesn't, but it sure makes it devoid of any integrity (as if any was, indeed, possible). Something about John Larroquette wanting to take over the company, industrial espionage, Culkin carrying out more "Home Alone" gags, weird James Bond gadgets (toy marketing?), Johnathan Hyde in a gay S&M leather outfit, yawn, yawn. Also, Rich and his family are apparently the richest on Earth, with a fortune in excess of $70 billion, yet it is never actually explained why (at least from what I can remember). The reason why they're rich is the entire crux of the story; without an explanation, Larroquette's motivation, or scheme, makes no sense, and the entire plot crumbles as a result. It's like watching a version of "Pirates of Silicon Valley" that doesn't involve any computers. Ugh. Am I simply supposed to buy the fact that they're rich just because they have all that money? Sorry, I don't. I've never read the comic book, so I can't attest to whether it's the same or not. Culkin sleepwalks through the film, having obviously become bored with acting. Avoid.

    I didn't absolutely hate Richie Rich, but for me it wasn't that great either. As usual, there were some good things, but some not so good things as well. THE GOOD THINGS: 1) Macaulay Culkin, personally I think he is better an actor than people give him credit for. He is one of the main reasons why I love the first two Home Alone movies so much. Here, he gives a very spirited lead performance, admittedly not as cute as he was when he was starring in underrated gems like Uncle Buck, but he shows once again what a talented actor he was. 2) Jonathan Hyde as the butler comes very close to stealing the show, a very funny and sly performance. Also Edward Hermann and Christine Ebersole give humorous performances, while John Larroquette plays the villain of the piece more than adequately. 3) The scenery is quite impressive, captured well by the breezy cinematography. The Biltmore estate was gorgeous. 4) The soundtrack was decent, nice background music especially. 5) I liked the moral the film taught; All the money in the world can't make you happy, thinking about it that is true. THE NOT SO GOOD THINGS: 1) While I liked the moral of the film, the story itself is predictable and somewhat contrived. it probably doesn't help you have seen it all before. 2) The script is quite weak in general. Don't get me wrong there were some good spots like "Oh my god I look like Michael Jackson!" but the jokes are admittedly very silly and juvenile, and the scripting does fall in the danger of becoming clich&eacute;d. 3) The pacing. Now I don't mind films that move fast. I do have more of a problem if the pacing is TOO fast, despite the feel good nature of the film, and its valiant attempt to rise above superficial material, the film feels a little too rushed, the ending particularly felt skimmed over. 4) The characters feel rather stereotypical. Maybe that is an unfair complaint as it probably couldn't be avoided, but I couldn't help thinking yeah I recognise that type of character. Overall, definitely not a bad film, worth watching at least once, but I personally didn't find it that great. 5/10 Bethany Cox

    Yes, I am not a member of his fan club and for the most part I hate nearly everything he was in. My favorite scene with him is the one in "The Good Son" involving the cliff. I had a nice laugh with that one. Here there is no such scene and the film might as well be called "Home Alone 3: this time the kids rich!" as it has almost the same premise. Granted the parents did not really leave him, but rather got into an airplane crash, but it is essentially the same as that brat is in this one too. So the story is the kid is lonely and tries to make friends, parents disappear after a plane crash, some dude is trying to get all the money for himself and there is no robot like there was in the original cartoon still trying to debate if that is a bad or good thing. All I know is that the film for the most part is cringe worthy, but as I have said I can not stand Macualay at all so I am going to tend to be against anything he is in. I did not like "Uncle Buck", "Home Alone" or any of the movies he has been in. Except for said scene, ah yes plunge to your death you spoiled sack of...ahem, the only reason I give this movie a two is that there was a joke in it that actually got me to laughing involving this laser or something blowing a chunk out of a stone statue. Other than that, barf.

    In 1994, Macaulay Culkin stared in 3 films: 'Richie Rich', 'The Pagemaster' and 'Getting even with dad', none of them particularly interesting. The movies themselves did poorly at cinemas and in critical terms. In 1994, Macaulay Culkin was 13/14 years old. He was in his early adolescence, so he was growing. A difficult phase for him. Ridiculously, people began to ignore him because of that - either that or they simply thought his cuteness was disappearing and gave him little value for that. But he always proved to be a terrific actor. True, there were many, many great child actors but he was one of them for sure. Sure, his cuteness took him far, but it was his talent that made him a legend. After playing a completely different role in the 1993 film 'The Good Son' (where he played a psychopath that could very well disguise that nature thanks to his angelical looks, a wolf in sheep's clothe), he returned to the roles of 'good guys' in all of his 1994 films. 'Richie Rich' is not much of a film, but perhaps it's a little more interesting than 'The Pagemaster'. It's not a bad movie, but it's a somewhat complex film for me to give a fair rating. It has good moments but also very stupid moments, particularly from the 2nd half on (in my opinion, where the movie is at its weakest). Macaulay Culkin plays the title character. Richie Rich is rich (like his name suggests), lives in a fancy mansion surrounded by comfort and luxury and can even count with a chauffeur that takes him in his majestic and elegant Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud whenever it's necessary. But Richie realizes that there is one thing that money can't buy: happiness. He feels the lack of friends and possibly bored with his tedious life. He just wants to be like the other kids. About the things I found funny in this film, a good example of that is the line &laquo;Oh my God, I look like Michael Jackson!&raquo; by Richie's mother. Come to think of it... that's not untrue - lol. I'm surprised they put this line in the film because Macaulay Culkin stars in it and considering the friendship he had with the eccentric singer... Other funny details are, for example, the cute dog that has dollar signs instead of spots and appropriately named Dollar, and the scene when Richie doesn't wanna wake up but stares at his personal trainer when he realizes what a beauty she is (she is portrayed by the supermodel Claudia Schiffer). Macaulay Culkin had everything to be a great name of the cinema. And he was, for a few years, mostly thanks to the success of the first two 'Home Alone' films. He was talented, charismatic and good-looking. Too bad he trashed his life later, but I believe he turned out to be like this because of his personal problems.

    From director Donald Petrie (Mystic Pizza, Miss Congeniality), this is a film that probably got many kids saving their pocket money, I certainly wished I was rich. Basically Richie Rich (Razzie nominated Macaulay Culkin) is the richest kid in the world with unlimited wealth and everything he could ever want. There is one thing thing he doesn't have that he longs for, a normal life with some friends, but one day he sees some kids playing baseball and wants to join them, but they don't want him around. Richie manages to get them to like him however when he invites them to enjoy themselves to his mansion and all its luxuries, including a roller-coaster and a McDonald's restaurant. Meanwhile, Lawrence Van Dough (John Larroquette), the Rich family's executive is planning to kill the family and steal their fortune, so when Richie realises, he with his new friends and trusted English butler Herbert Arthur Runcible Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde) plan to stop him. Also starring Edward Herrmann as Richard Rich, Christine Ebersole as Regina Rich, Michael McShane as Professor Keenbean, Chelcie Ross as Ferguson, Mariangela Pino as Diane Pazinski, Stephi Lineburg as Gloria Pazinski, Michael Maccarone as Tony and Claudia Schiffer as Aerobics Instructor. It has its moments of slapstick for the kids, but it is nowhere as entertaining as Home Alone, especially with Culkin reaching the age of 14 and nearly an adolescent. Okay!

    Inspired by the popular Harvey comics comes this above average kids flick from writers Tom S. Parker and Jim Jennewein (original story by Neil Tolkin) which sees our hero "Richie Rich" having to thwart an attempt to assume control of the family fortune. The plot is hardly inspiring, yet the cast make do with it to keep young viewers reasonably entertained. The cast are hardly riveting themselves, and all do better than the precocious Culkin. Evil John Larroquette as the greedy Van Dough and butler Jonathan Hyde do well, while Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole play Richard and Regina Rich. Daniel Petrie's direction saves the film as he keeps proceedings bouncing along nicely. Tuesday, September 30, 1997 - T.V.

    I gave this movie a 7 on a scale of 1-10 because I took into consideration it is a kids movie and should be judged as such. When this movie came out I was 13 and of course I enjoyed it much more then as opposed to now but having watched it as a child and as an adult I do remember how much I enjoyed the film as a kid. From the harsh grade of a 4.4 average I assume people where comparing this to complex movies with great plots. Kids should not be subjected to nothing but adult theme. So when you grade the movie remember what audience it was desighned for.As a child I would have gave this movie a 7. Would you drive a metro and act as if it should perform like a porsche?

    While 1994 was a great year to be Green Day or The Offspring, this was not so for the young Macaulay Culkin and his fans. As a 14 year old playing the younger 12 year "richest kid in the world", Culkin and his management must have realized quickly that he could not stay a child actor forever. Richie Rich, therefore became Culkin's last major project until his return to film as a 23-year-old young adult in 2003's Party Monster. In "Rich", no actor is in top form. The laughs were too few and too far between, especially for a family comedy. The post-Jurassic Park CGI "robot bee" may have even been a hindrance rather than a creative flourish. None of the characters were developed beyond the simple caricatures we'd expect and further stripped of comedic potential. By the time the antagonist breaks into the vault, anyone over the age of 17 probably knew what was inside; that is if they hadn't already stopped paying attention and fallen asleep. Had the film starred another adolescent lead, we may have been forgiving, but the overall quality of this venture paled in comparison with the Culkin we knew from Uncle Buck, the Home Alone pictures, My Girl, and even his brief appearance in Michael Jackson's 9 minute "Black or White" rampage. Being that it was filmed in and around the Chicagoland area, and that this reviewer is a sucker for anything local, this reviewer feels generous giving Richie Rich 4 out of 10 IMDb stars.
