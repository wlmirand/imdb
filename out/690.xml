 <sinopse>
  True story of Heinrich Harrer, an Austrian mountain climber who became friends with the Dalai Lama at the time of China's takeover of Tibet.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  After the death of 11 climbers, Austrian Heinrich Harrer (Brad Pitt) decides to add glory to his country and to the German pride by climbing Nanga Parbat in British India, and leaves his expectant wife behind. Egoist and a loner, he does not get along with others on his team - but must bend to their wishes after bad weather threatens them. Then WWII breaks out, they are arrested and lodged in Dehra Dun's P.O.W. Camp. He attempts to break out in vain several times, but finally does succeed along with Peter Aufschnaiter (David Thewlis), and end up in the holy city of Lhasa - a place banned to foreigners. They are provided food and shelter, and Peter ends up marrying a tailor, Pema Lhaki, while Heinrich befriends the Dalai Lama. He meets regularly to satiate the child's curiosity about the world, including Jack the Ripper and 'yellow hair'; in return he is exposed to teachings of Lord Buddha and even constructs a movie theater, while getting news of the end of the war; his divorce; and ...

    This had the foundations to be something truly special. An Austrian mountain climber leaves a dying marriage to explore the Himalayas in British India, but with the onset of World War II is forced to flea through inhospitable terrain to Tibet where he is befriended by a doomed world leader. Fantastic, how could such a unique and complex plot go wrong? Well believe me, they found a way. 10 minutes into the movie and I'd already given up on the script, it was dull from the first line and barely improved after that, no point waiting for a witty or insightful remark because it isn't coming. Then there was the editing. Seemingly important scenes are over in a heartbeat while pointless scenes are dragged out. Moments that seem like big twists are immediately and coincidently reversed just 5 seconds later, it's all a bit of a mess. The film never really flows, it limps along, takes a sudden leap, then limps again. Brad Pitt isn't too bad but the supporting cast is pretty hopeless, the acting quality would barely compete with a daytime soap opera, and the elevator music soundtrack just makes thing worse. If you like a bit of culture and funky scenery then it might be worth a look, but otherwise Seven Years in Tibet will feel like seven years in solitary confinement.

    Maybe it's that fact that I have read the book 3 times, but having read other books and seen the corresponding films this one was particularly bad. It starts with the main character, Heinrich Harrer, played by Brad Pitt. I'd have expected much more of a world class actor. He doesn't behave like an alpinist, nor does he resemble an Austrian in general. However, in defence of Pitt, the screenplay is probably the worst bit of this film and as such probably a difficult task for any actor. When Harrer was invited to the premiere of the film, he mostly praised it, but only because he was a polite and humble man - much to the contrary what Becky Johnston (the screenplay author) made of him. She quite obviously had no idea about alpinism and didn't research Harrer's life. She doesn't even seem to have understood the book itself. The real book certainly wasn't about a lost son (Rolf) or a lost marriage, nor was it about any rivalry between alpinists (Aufschnaiter - Harrer). Harrer and Aufschnaiter survived a physically and mentally extremely exhausting escape over the Himalayas under deadly conditions with very limited gear where most of us probably would have died many times. The endurance of this incredible achievement is totally lost in the film. In Lhasa, it was mostly his awestruck confrontation with a hidden culture, which was quite contrary to the film or simply didn't get through to the audience. Anyone who has seen Werner Herzog's "Rescue Dawn", would agree that an escape story can be done much better with a much lower budget.

    Beautifully filmed and well scored, Seven Years in Tibet narrates the story of Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer's journey (both physical and spiritual), his experiences in Lhasa, and his friendship with the child Dalai Lama. Heinrich Harrer's transformation from an emotionally immature and egotistic narcissist to an enlightened and more sensitive man parallels the story of Buddha's path to enlightenment.. Buddhism's underlying doctrine is that of compassion and it offers it's adherents a way of living that will remedy the suffering of the human condition. Harrer's discontent is his suffering. Prior to his journey to Tibet, Harrer's marriage is falling apart and he openly resents Aufschnaiter, the leader of the expedition to the Himalayas. Through his friendship with the Dalai Lama and the detachment from his "European way of life", Harrer learns to leave behind his selfish tendencies. He grows to regret abandoning his pregnant wife in favor of his own ambitions and manages to overcome his jealousy of Aufschnaiter for marrying Pema Lhaki. The wisdom that he gains from the Dalai Lama and Buddhist teachings even drives him to leave his beloved Tibet to return to Austria in order to make amends with his wife and son. As he deals with the challenges of scaling Nanga Parbet (the ninth highest mountain range in the world and the death of dozens of mountaineers before him), as well as the political turmoil of World War 2 Europe, he so too deals with his own demons and, despite not formally converting to Buddhism, adapts the clarity of a Buddhist way of life.

    This movie is about a journey of a arrogant and selfish man named Heinrich Harrer(Brad Pitt) and after he is taken captive as a prisoner of war. And how he finds peace and compassion within himself. The beginning is fast paced and not developed enough, which is fine for a movie that has a long story to tell as this one. But it just wasn't engaging or got my interest, even if it's because it's to get Heinrich Harrer's character down. There is a long waiting period before Heinrich Harrer makes it to Tibet and than it's when the movie kick off and becomes heartfelt and touching. Brad Pitt was close to his prime when this movie came out and when it comes to appearance wise he has the charisma to carry the movie. His acting was decent but his Austrian accent just seemed way too forced in this. Sometimes I get used to actors or actresses fake accents but not this time around. The love triangle part of this movie bring out Heinrich's character but what makes this movie emotionally moving. Is Heinrich's relationship with Dalai Lama in Tibet. In fact this movie made me feel for the Tibetan people who are these really peaceful people that thinks of there "enemy as there greatest teacher...Because only an enemy can help develop patience and compassion." And especially felt for the Tibetan people when they started to get suppressed by the Chinese army. Although this movie doesn't entirely grab at the heartstrings it does have a bit of heart to it and is worth a watch. It isn't a great film but it's a good one. 7.4/10

    Based on the book written by Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer that chronicles his experiences in Tibet between 1944 and 1951 during the Second World War;the interim period;and the Chinese People's Liberation Army's invasion of Tibet in 1950,Seven Years In Tibet tells the story of a man who undergoes character change that was prompted with one's relationship to the Dalai Lama. Brad Pitt stars as the arrogant Heinrich Harrer,a famed Austrian mountain climber who leaves behind his wife and infant son to head a Himalayan expedition in 1939, only to fall into the hands of Allied forces as a prisoner of war. He and a fellow escapee, Peter Aufschnaiter,played by David Thewlis, make their way to the Forbidden City in Tibet, where Peter finds a wife and Heinrich befriends the Western culture-obsessed teenage Dalai Lama,portrayed by Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk, the spiritual leader of his Buddhist nation. As Heinrich waits out the war, his friendship with the Dalai Lama begins to transform him from haughty to humble, but a crisis with China looms.The film ends with a series of title cards that list figures that quantify the death and destruction as a result of Chinese occupation. Harrer kept a good relationship with Dalai Lama after his flee from Tibet to India. The story was characterized as a road picture,epic and spiritual journey of Harrer.It is a beautiful film with a story so typical-yet-unusual coming-of-age of a man who becomes a better person.Although the relationship between Harrer and Dalai Lama was lacking,it manages to become interesting due to the extra-ordinary performance of Brad Pitt.Because of it,the film does not fall short in both satisfaction and entertainment despite this shortcoming.

    Ever since Ronald Colman raised the bar of expectation by his not so chance encounter with Shangri-La in the 1937 movie rendition of "Lost Horizon", we have been trying to find our way back. Thanks to movies like "Seven years in Tibet", we can focus on the real issues rather than paradise revisited. With the release of the movie version of Heinrich Harrer's "Seven Years in Tibet" we are presented with a different story - one less fairly tale...Jacque Annaud's...film allows us to move away from the fantasy created by "Lost Horizon"... Annaud succeeds in bringing Tibet to life, to make it more human, more real. As much as the story is Harrer's, it seems inevitable that the focus moves away from him and onto the Dalai Lama. The book reads like an outsider looking at things from the outside in. The focus of the book, is all Harrer. Luckily, film has an ability to visualize the books cannot ever provide - a real immediate feel. The movie is everything and it at times almost feels like it will slide into Indiana Jones. However, the power of Tibet saves it. It almost feel like Pitt and Thewlis are out of place. The real stars are the set, the landscape and the Nepalese extras. Filmed everywhere but Tibet, the film does give its western audience a real soft landing, one that they will not get with Scorsese's "Kundun"... Hollywood does need to supply a demand and we demand epic scenes, high priced talent, a sense of the exotic. As if east meets west and the fusion of the two is greater than the sum of the parts. For the attention to detail, I can't help but sing the praises. If you can stomach Pitt's fake Austrian accent, the film is a visual delight. It would be a tempting fantasy to hope that we can preserve it...

    Plot: The true story of an Austrian mountain climber called Heinrich Harrer and his experiences in Tibet, mainly his friendship with Dalai Lama at the time of China's invasion of Tibetan land. You'll love Seven Years In Tibet if: You want great cinematography aaaaaand that's it I honestly can't find any really good thing about it besides the wonderful scenery. The great snowy mountains and the barren fields of Tibet look wonderful, (although in reality what we see is Peru). What else? Nothing really while there isn't anything really bad in here, I can't think of anything good either You'll hate Seven Years In Tibet if: You want a movie that has a conclusion, is more historically accurate and if you expected a better adaptation of the book. What is the movie supposed to be about? Most people think it's the way Heinrich changes from a complete Nazi a$$ that doesn't care about anything to a humble, "changed" man through his relationship with Dalai Lama. The problem is that while that does happen we don't see how! How in the heck did he change? Why exactly Dalai Lama wanted to meet him? Because he knew a lot of things about the western world??? Others think that it was a movie that had to do with China's invasion in Tibet. Another failed attempt IMO. While I'm no historian I feel that the movie tends to have a propagandist style, with Tibetan monks and Dalai Lama portrayed as "angels" and Chinese as the evil invaders? Okay, lets say I'm stupid and didn't manage to get the point of the movie let's say there is something really good here. Unfortunately the pacing of the movie destroys that too. We see Heinrich in the beginning boarding a train, then we see Heinrich climbing the mountain, then we see him get caught by the British, then he escapes, then he climbs more mountains, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then then he meets Dalai Lama, he becomes a great guy and returns home. Sweeeeeet! FINAL VERDICT: And The Moral Of The Story Is? (3.2/10) [+] Very good cinematography with great mountain landscapes. [-] A story with a beginning but no real ending. Veeery slow pacing. Slight historical inaccuracies. Very different from the far better book. Also Check: American History X (1998)  Au Revoir Les Enfants (1987)  Defiance (2008)  Kundun (1997) P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say "I like\don't like this movie" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...

    I think this movie is great. It touches your heart and your soul. It helps to give faces to Tibetans and their plight. It speaks about the German invasion and an individual's struggle towards becoming themselves. I thought it was amazing. To see a man, who would not take no for an answer or accept that he could be held down. Continue to fight despite what others said and learning who he is gaining peace in his objectives towards life and achieving his goal. Planting the Tibetan Flag was an awesome contrast to the beginning when he was told to plant the flag with the swastika. The movie contained depth and broaden/confirmed my perception regarding why we are here. Maybe I am simple but I thought it was great. There is more to life than this, if I could give it all up and lead that lifestyle my life would be good. Only thing I hated to see was the oppression.

    This is a long one. Based on a true story about an Austrian mountaineer. Brad tries to climate the Himalayas and is imprisoned in a prisoner of war camp. He escapes and tries to travel through Tibet but is kicked out as foreigners are forbidden until he befriends the Dahli Lama. Part road picture, part epic, and part spiritual journey, Seven Years in Tibet is a beautiful film with a story so typical-yet-unusual that it could only have come from autobiography. Beautiful and unforgettable,If you have not seen this yet you should! loved it. This masterpiece, still makes me curious every time I see it. Brad Pitt does an amazing job portraying an Austrian, even down to his accent. The cinematography is extraordinary, and the direction is quite good. I love watching it every so often, and learning new things that I missed the times before. Overall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended. superb movie.

    Plot: The true story of an Austrian mountain climber called Heinrich Harrer and his experiences in Tibet, mainly his friendship with Dalai Lama at the time of China's invasion of Tibetan land. You'll love Seven Years In Tibet if: You want great cinematography aaaaaand that's it I honestly can't find any really good thing about it besides the wonderful scenery. The great snowy mountains and the barren fields of Tibet look wonderful, (although in reality what we see is Peru). What else? Nothing really while there isn't anything really bad in here, I can't think of anything good either You'll hate Seven Years In Tibet if: You want a movie that has a conclusion, is more historically accurate and if you expected a better adaptation of the book. What is the movie supposed to be about? Most people think it's the way Heinrich changes from a complete Nazi a$$ that doesn't care about anything to a humble, "changed" man through his relationship with Dalai Lama. The problem is that while that does happen we don't see how! How in the heck did he change? Why exactly Dalai Lama wanted to meet him? Because he knew a lot of things about the western world??? Others think that it was a movie that had to do with China's invasion in Tibet. Another failed attempt IMO. While I'm no historian I feel that the movie tends to have a propagandist style, with Tibetan monks and Dalai Lama portrayed as "angels" and Chinese as the evil invaders? Okay, lets say I'm stupid and didn't manage to get the point of the movie let's say there is something really good here. Unfortunately the pacing of the movie destroys that too. We see Heinrich in the beginning boarding a train, then we see Heinrich climbing the mountain, then we see him get caught by the British, then he escapes, then he climbs more mountains, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then then he meets Dalai Lama, he becomes a great guy and returns home. Sweeeeeet! FINAL VERDICT: And The Moral Of The Story Is? (3.2/10) [+] Very good cinematography with great mountain landscapes. [-] A story with a beginning but no real ending. Veeery slow pacing. Slight historical inaccuracies. Very different from the far better book. Also Check: American History X (1998)  Au Revoir Les Enfants (1987)  Defiance (2008)  Kundun (1997) P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say "I like\don't like this movie" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...

    I think this movie is great. It touches your heart and your soul. It helps to give faces to Tibetans and their plight. It speaks about the German invasion and an individual's struggle towards becoming themselves. I thought it was amazing. To see a man, who would not take no for an answer or accept that he could be held down. Continue to fight despite what others said and learning who he is gaining peace in his objectives towards life and achieving his goal. Planting the Tibetan Flag was an awesome contrast to the beginning when he was told to plant the flag with the swastika. The movie contained depth and broaden/confirmed my perception regarding why we are here. Maybe I am simple but I thought it was great. There is more to life than this, if I could give it all up and lead that lifestyle my life would be good. Only thing I hated to see was the oppression.

    This is a long one. Based on a true story about an Austrian mountaineer. Brad tries to climate the Himalayas and is imprisoned in a prisoner of war camp. He escapes and tries to travel through Tibet but is kicked out as foreigners are forbidden until he befriends the Dahli Lama. Part road picture, part epic, and part spiritual journey, Seven Years in Tibet is a beautiful film with a story so typical-yet-unusual that it could only have come from autobiography. Beautiful and unforgettable,If you have not seen this yet you should! loved it. This masterpiece, still makes me curious every time I see it. Brad Pitt does an amazing job portraying an Austrian, even down to his accent. The cinematography is extraordinary, and the direction is quite good. I love watching it every so often, and learning new things that I missed the times before. Overall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended. superb movie.

    This had the foundations to be something truly special. An Austrian mountain climber leaves a dying marriage to explore the Himalayas in British India, but with the onset of World War II is forced to flea through inhospitable terrain to Tibet where he is befriended by a doomed world leader. Fantastic, how could such a unique and complex plot go wrong? Well believe me, they found a way. 10 minutes into the movie and I'd already given up on the script, it was dull from the first line and barely improved after that, no point waiting for a witty or insightful remark because it isn't coming. Then there was the editing. Seemingly important scenes are over in a heartbeat while pointless scenes are dragged out. Moments that seem like big twists are immediately and coincidently reversed just 5 seconds later, it's all a bit of a mess. The film never really flows, it limps along, takes a sudden leap, then limps again. Brad Pitt isn't too bad but the supporting cast is pretty hopeless, the acting quality would barely compete with a daytime soap opera, and the elevator music soundtrack just makes thing worse. If you like a bit of culture and funky scenery then it might be worth a look, but otherwise Seven Years in Tibet will feel like seven years in solitary confinement.

    Maybe it's that fact that I have read the book 3 times, but having read other books and seen the corresponding films this one was particularly bad. It starts with the main character, Heinrich Harrer, played by Brad Pitt. I'd have expected much more of a world class actor. He doesn't behave like an alpinist, nor does he resemble an Austrian in general. However, in defence of Pitt, the screenplay is probably the worst bit of this film and as such probably a difficult task for any actor. When Harrer was invited to the premiere of the film, he mostly praised it, but only because he was a polite and humble man - much to the contrary what Becky Johnston (the screenplay author) made of him. She quite obviously had no idea about alpinism and didn't research Harrer's life. She doesn't even seem to have understood the book itself. The real book certainly wasn't about a lost son (Rolf) or a lost marriage, nor was it about any rivalry between alpinists (Aufschnaiter - Harrer). Harrer and Aufschnaiter survived a physically and mentally extremely exhausting escape over the Himalayas under deadly conditions with very limited gear where most of us probably would have died many times. The endurance of this incredible achievement is totally lost in the film. In Lhasa, it was mostly his awestruck confrontation with a hidden culture, which was quite contrary to the film or simply didn't get through to the audience. Anyone who has seen Werner Herzog's "Rescue Dawn", would agree that an escape story can be done much better with a much lower budget.

    Beautifully filmed and well scored, Seven Years in Tibet narrates the story of Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer's journey (both physical and spiritual), his experiences in Lhasa, and his friendship with the child Dalai Lama. Heinrich Harrer's transformation from an emotionally immature and egotistic narcissist to an enlightened and more sensitive man parallels the story of Buddha's path to enlightenment.. Buddhism's underlying doctrine is that of compassion and it offers it's adherents a way of living that will remedy the suffering of the human condition. Harrer's discontent is his suffering. Prior to his journey to Tibet, Harrer's marriage is falling apart and he openly resents Aufschnaiter, the leader of the expedition to the Himalayas. Through his friendship with the Dalai Lama and the detachment from his "European way of life", Harrer learns to leave behind his selfish tendencies. He grows to regret abandoning his pregnant wife in favor of his own ambitions and manages to overcome his jealousy of Aufschnaiter for marrying Pema Lhaki. The wisdom that he gains from the Dalai Lama and Buddhist teachings even drives him to leave his beloved Tibet to return to Austria in order to make amends with his wife and son. As he deals with the challenges of scaling Nanga Parbet (the ninth highest mountain range in the world and the death of dozens of mountaineers before him), as well as the political turmoil of World War 2 Europe, he so too deals with his own demons and, despite not formally converting to Buddhism, adapts the clarity of a Buddhist way of life.

    This movie is about a journey of a arrogant and selfish man named Heinrich Harrer(Brad Pitt) and after he is taken captive as a prisoner of war. And how he finds peace and compassion within himself. The beginning is fast paced and not developed enough, which is fine for a movie that has a long story to tell as this one. But it just wasn't engaging or got my interest, even if it's because it's to get Heinrich Harrer's character down. There is a long waiting period before Heinrich Harrer makes it to Tibet and than it's when the movie kick off and becomes heartfelt and touching. Brad Pitt was close to his prime when this movie came out and when it comes to appearance wise he has the charisma to carry the movie. His acting was decent but his Austrian accent just seemed way too forced in this. Sometimes I get used to actors or actresses fake accents but not this time around. The love triangle part of this movie bring out Heinrich's character but what makes this movie emotionally moving. Is Heinrich's relationship with Dalai Lama in Tibet. In fact this movie made me feel for the Tibetan people who are these really peaceful people that thinks of there "enemy as there greatest teacher...Because only an enemy can help develop patience and compassion." And especially felt for the Tibetan people when they started to get suppressed by the Chinese army. Although this movie doesn't entirely grab at the heartstrings it does have a bit of heart to it and is worth a watch. It isn't a great film but it's a good one. 7.4/10

    Based on the book written by Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer that chronicles his experiences in Tibet between 1944 and 1951 during the Second World War;the interim period;and the Chinese People's Liberation Army's invasion of Tibet in 1950,Seven Years In Tibet tells the story of a man who undergoes character change that was prompted with one's relationship to the Dalai Lama. Brad Pitt stars as the arrogant Heinrich Harrer,a famed Austrian mountain climber who leaves behind his wife and infant son to head a Himalayan expedition in 1939, only to fall into the hands of Allied forces as a prisoner of war. He and a fellow escapee, Peter Aufschnaiter,played by David Thewlis, make their way to the Forbidden City in Tibet, where Peter finds a wife and Heinrich befriends the Western culture-obsessed teenage Dalai Lama,portrayed by Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk, the spiritual leader of his Buddhist nation. As Heinrich waits out the war, his friendship with the Dalai Lama begins to transform him from haughty to humble, but a crisis with China looms.The film ends with a series of title cards that list figures that quantify the death and destruction as a result of Chinese occupation. Harrer kept a good relationship with Dalai Lama after his flee from Tibet to India. The story was characterized as a road picture,epic and spiritual journey of Harrer.It is a beautiful film with a story so typical-yet-unusual coming-of-age of a man who becomes a better person.Although the relationship between Harrer and Dalai Lama was lacking,it manages to become interesting due to the extra-ordinary performance of Brad Pitt.Because of it,the film does not fall short in both satisfaction and entertainment despite this shortcoming.

    Ever since Ronald Colman raised the bar of expectation by his not so chance encounter with Shangri-La in the 1937 movie rendition of "Lost Horizon", we have been trying to find our way back. Thanks to movies like "Seven years in Tibet", we can focus on the real issues rather than paradise revisited. With the release of the movie version of Heinrich Harrer's "Seven Years in Tibet" we are presented with a different story - one less fairly tale...Jacque Annaud's...film allows us to move away from the fantasy created by "Lost Horizon"... Annaud succeeds in bringing Tibet to life, to make it more human, more real. As much as the story is Harrer's, it seems inevitable that the focus moves away from him and onto the Dalai Lama. The book reads like an outsider looking at things from the outside in. The focus of the book, is all Harrer. Luckily, film has an ability to visualize the books cannot ever provide - a real immediate feel. The movie is everything and it at times almost feels like it will slide into Indiana Jones. However, the power of Tibet saves it. It almost feel like Pitt and Thewlis are out of place. The real stars are the set, the landscape and the Nepalese extras. Filmed everywhere but Tibet, the film does give its western audience a real soft landing, one that they will not get with Scorsese's "Kundun"... Hollywood does need to supply a demand and we demand epic scenes, high priced talent, a sense of the exotic. As if east meets west and the fusion of the two is greater than the sum of the parts. For the attention to detail, I can't help but sing the praises. If you can stomach Pitt's fake Austrian accent, the film is a visual delight. It would be a tempting fantasy to hope that we can preserve it...

The story was characterized as a road picture,epic and spiritual journey of Harrer.It is a beautiful film with a story so typical-yet-unusual coming-of-age of a man who becomes a better person.Although the relationship between Harrer and Dalai Lama was lacking,it manages to become interesting due to the extra-ordinary performance of Brad Pitt.Because of it,the film does not fall short in both satisfaction and entertainment despite this shortcoming.

    Ever since Ronald Colman raised the bar of expectation by his not so chance encounter with Shangri-La in the 1937 movie rendition of "Lost Horizon", we have been trying to find our way back. Thanks to movies like "Seven years in Tibet", we can focus on the real issues rather than paradise revisited. With the release of the movie version of Heinrich Harrer's "Seven Years in Tibet" we are presented with a different story - one less fairly tale...Jacque Annaud's...film allows us to move away from the fantasy created by "Lost Horizon"... Annaud succeeds in bringing Tibet to life, to make it more human, more real. As much as the story is Harrer's, it seems inevitable that the focus moves away from him and onto the Dalai Lama. The book reads like an outsider looking at things from the outside in. The focus of the book, is all Harrer. Luckily, film has an ability to visualize the books cannot ever provide - a real immediate feel. The movie is everything and it at times almost feels like it will slide into Indiana Jones. However, the power of Tibet saves it. It almost feel like Pitt and Thewlis are out of place. The real stars are the set, the landscape and the Nepalese extras. Filmed everywhere but Tibet, the film does give its western audience a real soft landing, one that they will not get with Scorsese's "Kundun"... Hollywood does need to supply a demand and we demand epic scenes, high priced talent, a sense of the exotic. As if east meets west and the fusion of the two is greater than the sum of the parts. For the attention to detail, I can't help but sing the praises. If you can stomach Pitt's fake Austrian accent, the film is a visual delight. It would be a tempting fantasy to hope that we can preserve it...

    Plot: The true story of an Austrian mountain climber called Heinrich Harrer and his experiences in Tibet, mainly his friendship with Dalai Lama at the time of China's invasion of Tibetan land. You'll love Seven Years In Tibet if: You want great cinematography aaaaaand that's it I honestly can't find any really good thing about it besides the wonderful scenery. The great snowy mountains and the barren fields of Tibet look wonderful, (although in reality what we see is Peru). What else? Nothing really while there isn't anything really bad in here, I can't think of anything good either You'll hate Seven Years In Tibet if: You want a movie that has a conclusion, is more historically accurate and if you expected a better adaptation of the book. What is the movie supposed to be about? Most people think it's the way Heinrich changes from a complete Nazi a$$ that doesn't care about anything to a humble, "changed" man through his relationship with Dalai Lama. The problem is that while that does happen we don't see how! How in the heck did he change? Why exactly Dalai Lama wanted to meet him? Because he knew a lot of things about the western world??? Others think that it was a movie that had to do with China's invasion in Tibet. Another failed attempt IMO. While I'm no historian I feel that the movie tends to have a propagandist style, with Tibetan monks and Dalai Lama portrayed as "angels" and Chinese as the evil invaders? Okay, lets say I'm stupid and didn't manage to get the point of the movie let's say there is something really good here. Unfortunately the pacing of the movie destroys that too. We see Heinrich in the beginning boarding a train, then we see Heinrich climbing the mountain, then we see him get caught by the British, then he escapes, then he climbs more mountains, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then then he meets Dalai Lama, he becomes a great guy and returns home. Sweeeeeet! FINAL VERDICT: And The Moral Of The Story Is? (3.2/10) [+] Very good cinematography with great mountain landscapes. [-] A story with a beginning but no real ending. Veeery slow pacing. Slight historical inaccuracies. Very different from the far better book. Also Check: American History X (1998)  Au Revoir Les Enfants (1987)  Defiance (2008)  Kundun (1997) P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say "I like\don't like this movie" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...

    I think this movie is great. It touches your heart and your soul. It helps to give faces to Tibetans and their plight. It speaks about the German invasion and an individual's struggle towards becoming themselves. I thought it was amazing. To see a man, who would not take no for an answer or accept that he could be held down. Continue to fight despite what others said and learning who he is gaining peace in his objectives towards life and achieving his goal. Planting the Tibetan Flag was an awesome contrast to the beginning when he was told to plant the flag with the swastika. The movie contained depth and broaden/confirmed my perception regarding why we are here. Maybe I am simple but I thought it was great. There is more to life than this, if I could give it all up and lead that lifestyle my life would be good. Only thing I hated to see was the oppression.

    This is a long one. Based on a true story about an Austrian mountaineer. Brad tries to climate the Himalayas and is imprisoned in a prisoner of war camp. He escapes and tries to travel through Tibet but is kicked out as foreigners are forbidden until he befriends the Dahli Lama. Part road picture, part epic, and part spiritual journey, Seven Years in Tibet is a beautiful film with a story so typical-yet-unusual that it could only have come from autobiography. Beautiful and unforgettable,If you have not seen this yet you should! loved it. This masterpiece, still makes me curious every time I see it. Brad Pitt does an amazing job portraying an Austrian, even down to his accent. The cinematography is extraordinary, and the direction is quite good. I love watching it every so often, and learning new things that I missed the times before. Overall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended. superb movie.

    This had the foundations to be something truly special. An Austrian mountain climber leaves a dying marriage to explore the Himalayas in British India, but with the onset of World War II is forced to flea through inhospitable terrain to Tibet where he is befriended by a doomed world leader. Fantastic, how could such a unique and complex plot go wrong? Well believe me, they found a way. 10 minutes into the movie and I'd already given up on the script, it was dull from the first line and barely improved after that, no point waiting for a witty or insightful remark because it isn't coming. Then there was the editing. Seemingly important scenes are over in a heartbeat while pointless scenes are dragged out. Moments that seem like big twists are immediately and coincidently reversed just 5 seconds later, it's all a bit of a mess. The film never really flows, it limps along, takes a sudden leap, then limps again. Brad Pitt isn't too bad but the supporting cast is pretty hopeless, the acting quality would barely compete with a daytime soap opera, and the elevator music soundtrack just makes thing worse. If you like a bit of culture and funky scenery then it might be worth a look, but otherwise Seven Years in Tibet will feel like seven years in solitary confinement.

    Maybe it's that fact that I have read the book 3 times, but having read other books and seen the corresponding films this one was particularly bad. It starts with the main character, Heinrich Harrer, played by Brad Pitt. I'd have expected much more of a world class actor. He doesn't behave like an alpinist, nor does he resemble an Austrian in general. However, in defence of Pitt, the screenplay is probably the worst bit of this film and as such probably a difficult task for any actor. When Harrer was invited to the premiere of the film, he mostly praised it, but only because he was a polite and humble man - much to the contrary what Becky Johnston (the screenplay author) made of him. She quite obviously had no idea about alpinism and didn't research Harrer's life. She doesn't even seem to have understood the book itself. The real book certainly wasn't about a lost son (Rolf) or a lost marriage, nor was it about any rivalry between alpinists (Aufschnaiter - Harrer). Harrer and Aufschnaiter survived a physically and mentally extremely exhausting escape over the Himalayas under deadly conditions with very limited gear where most of us probably would have died many times. The endurance of this incredible achievement is totally lost in the film. In Lhasa, it was mostly his awestruck confrontation with a hidden culture, which was quite contrary to the film or simply didn't get through to the audience. Anyone who has seen Werner Herzog's "Rescue Dawn", would agree that an escape story can be done much better with a much lower budget.

    Beautifully filmed and well scored, Seven Years in Tibet narrates the story of Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer's journey (both physical and spiritual), his experiences in Lhasa, and his friendship with the child Dalai Lama. Heinrich Harrer's transformation from an emotionally immature and egotistic narcissist to an enlightened and more sensitive man parallels the story of Buddha's path to enlightenment.. Buddhism's underlying doctrine is that of compassion and it offers it's adherents a way of living that will remedy the suffering of the human condition. Harrer's discontent is his suffering. Prior to his journey to Tibet, Harrer's marriage is falling apart and he openly resents Aufschnaiter, the leader of the expedition to the Himalayas. Through his friendship with the Dalai Lama and the detachment from his "European way of life", Harrer learns to leave behind his selfish tendencies. He grows to regret abandoning his pregnant wife in favor of his own ambitions and manages to overcome his jealousy of Aufschnaiter for marrying Pema Lhaki. The wisdom that he gains from the Dalai Lama and Buddhist teachings even drives him to leave his beloved Tibet to return to Austria in order to make amends with his wife and son. As he deals with the challenges of scaling Nanga Parbet (the ninth highest mountain range in the world and the death of dozens of mountaineers before him), as well as the political turmoil of World War 2 Europe, he so too deals with his own demons and, despite not formally converting to Buddhism, adapts the clarity of a Buddhist way of life.

    This movie is about a journey of a arrogant and selfish man named Heinrich Harrer(Brad Pitt) and after he is taken captive as a prisoner of war. And how he finds peace and compassion within himself. The beginning is fast paced and not developed enough, which is fine for a movie that has a long story to tell as this one. But it just wasn't engaging or got my interest, even if it's because it's to get Heinrich Harrer's character down. There is a long waiting period before Heinrich Harrer makes it to Tibet and than it's when the movie kick off and becomes heartfelt and touching. Brad Pitt was close to his prime when this movie came out and when it comes to appearance wise he has the charisma to carry the movie. His acting was decent but his Austrian accent just seemed way too forced in this. Sometimes I get used to actors or actresses fake accents but not this time around. The love triangle part of this movie bring out Heinrich's character but what makes this movie emotionally moving. Is Heinrich's relationship with Dalai Lama in Tibet. In fact this movie made me feel for the Tibetan people who are these really peaceful people that thinks of there "enemy as there greatest teacher...Because only an enemy can help develop patience and compassion." And especially felt for the Tibetan people when they started to get suppressed by the Chinese army. Although this movie doesn't entirely grab at the heartstrings it does have a bit of heart to it and is worth a watch. It isn't a great film but it's a good one. 7.4/10

    remarkable work. discover a meeting and an universe in gentle and wise way. define a reality. present metamorphose of a life. and, more important, give honest image of facts, without ordinaries ambitions.a film who confirms art of Brad Pitt far from any etiquette. who draws the real Tibet atmosphere out of desire to be a lesson or political answer. who suggest and build grace of colors, sound and silence key for understand a place as part of yourself. sure, it is not perfect. but, like many other exercise , it is a view about things. a profound view, sine ira et studio, but with subtle spirit of joy.this fact is important. and basis of a way to transform existence in precious value. because, it is not a Budist story or a page from a Nazi figure experiences. but only a confession. without rules. without ambition to be revelation. only testimony. and this is its great virtue of this remarkable adaptation.

    Based on the book written by Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer that chronicles his experiences in Tibet between 1944 and 1951 during the Second World War;the interim period;and the Chinese People's Liberation Army's invasion of Tibet in 1950,Seven Years In Tibet tells the story of a man who undergoes character change that was prompted with one's relationship to the Dalai Lama. Brad Pitt stars as the arrogant Heinrich Harrer,a famed Austrian mountain climber who leaves behind his wife and infant son to head a Himalayan expedition in 1939, only to fall into the hands of Allied forces as a prisoner of war. He and a fellow escapee, Peter Aufschnaiter,played by David Thewlis, make their way to the Forbidden City in Tibet, where Peter finds a wife and Heinrich befriends the Western culture-obsessed teenage Dalai Lama,portrayed by Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk, the spiritual leader of his Buddhist nation. As Heinrich waits out the war, his friendship with the Dalai Lama begins to transform him from haughty to humble, but a crisis with China looms.The film ends with a series of title cards that list figures that quantify the death and destruction as a result of Chinese occupation. Harrer kept a good relationship with Dalai Lama after his flee from Tibet to India. The story was characterized as a road picture,epic and spiritual journey of Harrer.It is a beautiful film with a story so typical-yet-unusual coming-of-age of a man who becomes a better person.Although the relationship between Harrer and Dalai Lama was lacking,it manages to become interesting due to the extra-ordinary performance of Brad Pitt.Because of it,the film does not fall short in both satisfaction and entertainment despite this shortcoming.

    Ever since Ronald Colman raised the bar of expectation by his not so chance encounter with Shangri-La in the 1937 movie rendition of "Lost Horizon", we have been trying to find our way back. Thanks to movies like "Seven years in Tibet", we can focus on the real issues rather than paradise revisited. With the release of the movie version of Heinrich Harrer's "Seven Years in Tibet" we are presented with a different story - one less fairly tale...Jacque Annaud's...film allows us to move away from the fantasy created by "Lost Horizon"...

Filmed everywhere but Tibet, the film does give its western audience a real soft landing, one that they will not get with Scorsese's "Kundun"... Hollywood does need to supply a demand and we demand epic scenes, high priced talent, a sense of the exotic. As if east meets west and the fusion of the two is greater than the sum of the parts. For the attention to detail, I can't help but sing the praises. If you can stomach Pitt's fake Austrian accent, the film is a visual delight. It would be a tempting fantasy to hope that we can preserve it...

    Based on the book written by Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer that chronicles his experiences in Tibet between 1944 and 1951 during the Second World War;the interim period;and the Chinese People's Liberation Army's invasion of Tibet in 1950,Seven Years In Tibet tells the story of a man who undergoes character change that was prompted with one's relationship to the Dalai Lama. Brad Pitt stars as the arrogant Heinrich Harrer,a famed Austrian mountain climber who leaves behind his wife and infant son to head a Himalayan expedition in 1939, only to fall into the hands of Allied forces as a prisoner of war. He and a fellow escapee, Peter Aufschnaiter,played by David Thewlis, make their way to the Forbidden City in Tibet, where Peter finds a wife and Heinrich befriends the Western culture-obsessed teenage Dalai Lama,portrayed by Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk, the spiritual leader of his Buddhist nation. As Heinrich waits out the war, his friendship with the Dalai Lama begins to transform him from haughty to humble, but a crisis with China looms.The film ends with a series of title cards that list figures that quantify the death and destruction as a result of Chinese occupation. Harrer kept a good relationship with Dalai Lama after his flee from Tibet to India. The story was characterized as a road picture,epic and spiritual journey of Harrer.It is a beautiful film with a story so typical-yet-unusual coming-of-age of a man who becomes a better person.Although the relationship between Harrer and Dalai Lama was lacking,it manages to become interesting due to the extra-ordinary performance of Brad Pitt.Because of it,the film does not fall short in both satisfaction and entertainment despite this shortcoming.

    Ever since Ronald Colman raised the bar of expectation by his not so chance encounter with Shangri-La in the 1937 movie rendition of "Lost Horizon", we have been trying to find our way back. Thanks to movies like "Seven years in Tibet", we can focus on the real issues rather than paradise revisited. With the release of the movie version of Heinrich Harrer's "Seven Years in Tibet" we are presented with a different story - one less fairly tale...Jacque Annaud's...film allows us to move away from the fantasy created by "Lost Horizon"... Annaud succeeds in bringing Tibet to life, to make it more human, more real. As much as the story is Harrer's, it seems inevitable that the focus moves away from him and onto the Dalai Lama. The book reads like an outsider looking at things from the outside in. The focus of the book, is all Harrer. Luckily, film has an ability to visualize the books cannot ever provide - a real immediate feel. The movie is everything and it at times almost feels like it will slide into Indiana Jones. However, the power of Tibet saves it. It almost feel like Pitt and Thewlis are out of place. The real stars are the set, the landscape and the Nepalese extras. Filmed everywhere but Tibet, the film does give its western audience a real soft landing, one that they will not get with Scorsese's "Kundun"... Hollywood does need to supply a demand and we demand epic scenes, high priced talent, a sense of the exotic. As if east meets west and the fusion of the two is greater than the sum of the parts. For the attention to detail, I can't help but sing the praises. If you can stomach Pitt's fake Austrian accent, the film is a visual delight. It would be a tempting fantasy to hope that we can preserve it...

    Plot: The true story of an Austrian mountain climber called Heinrich Harrer and his experiences in Tibet, mainly his friendship with Dalai Lama at the time of China's invasion of Tibetan land. You'll love Seven Years In Tibet if: You want great cinematography aaaaaand that's it I honestly can't find any really good thing about it besides the wonderful scenery. The great snowy mountains and the barren fields of Tibet look wonderful, (although in reality what we see is Peru). What else? Nothing really while there isn't anything really bad in here, I can't think of anything good either You'll hate Seven Years In Tibet if: You want a movie that has a conclusion, is more historically accurate and if you expected a better adaptation of the book. What is the movie supposed to be about? Most people think it's the way Heinrich changes from a complete Nazi a$$ that doesn't care about anything to a humble, "changed" man through his relationship with Dalai Lama. The problem is that while that does happen we don't see how! How in the heck did he change? Why exactly Dalai Lama wanted to meet him? Because he knew a lot of things about the western world??? Others think that it was a movie that had to do with China's invasion in Tibet. Another failed attempt IMO. While I'm no historian I feel that the movie tends to have a propagandist style, with Tibetan monks and Dalai Lama portrayed as "angels" and Chinese as the evil invaders? Okay, lets say I'm stupid and didn't manage to get the point of the movie let's say there is something really good here. Unfortunately the pacing of the movie destroys that too. We see Heinrich in the beginning boarding a train, then we see Heinrich climbing the mountain, then we see him get caught by the British, then he escapes, then he climbs more mountains, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then then he meets Dalai Lama, he becomes a great guy and returns home. Sweeeeeet! FINAL VERDICT: And The Moral Of The Story Is? (3.2/10) [+] Very good cinematography with great mountain landscapes. [-] A story with a beginning but no real ending. Veeery slow pacing. Slight historical inaccuracies. Very different from the far better book. Also Check: American History X (1998)  Au Revoir Les Enfants (1987)  Defiance (2008)  Kundun (1997) P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say "I like\don't like this movie" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...

    I think this movie is great. It touches your heart and your soul. It helps to give faces to Tibetans and their plight. It speaks about the German invasion and an individual's struggle towards becoming themselves. I thought it was amazing. To see a man, who would not take no for an answer or accept that he could be held down. Continue to fight despite what others said and learning who he is gaining peace in his objectives towards life and achieving his goal. Planting the Tibetan Flag was an awesome contrast to the beginning when he was told to plant the flag with the swastika. The movie contained depth and broaden/confirmed my perception regarding why we are here. Maybe I am simple but I thought it was great. There is more to life than this, if I could give it all up and lead that lifestyle my life would be good. Only thing I hated to see was the oppression.

    This is a long one. Based on a true story about an Austrian mountaineer. Brad tries to climate the Himalayas and is imprisoned in a prisoner of war camp. He escapes and tries to travel through Tibet but is kicked out as foreigners are forbidden until he befriends the Dahli Lama. Part road picture, part epic, and part spiritual journey, Seven Years in Tibet is a beautiful film with a story so typical-yet-unusual that it could only have come from autobiography. Beautiful and unforgettable,If you have not seen this yet you should! loved it. This masterpiece, still makes me curious every time I see it. Brad Pitt does an amazing job portraying an Austrian, even down to his accent. The cinematography is extraordinary, and the direction is quite good. I love watching it every so often, and learning new things that I missed the times before. Overall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended. superb movie.

    This had the foundations to be something truly special. An Austrian mountain climber leaves a dying marriage to explore the Himalayas in British India, but with the onset of World War II is forced to flea through inhospitable terrain to Tibet where he is befriended by a doomed world leader. Fantastic, how could such a unique and complex plot go wrong? Well believe me, they found a way. 10 minutes into the movie and I'd already given up on the script, it was dull from the first line and barely improved after that, no point waiting for a witty or insightful remark because it isn't coming. Then there was the editing. Seemingly important scenes are over in a heartbeat while pointless scenes are dragged out. Moments that seem like big twists are immediately and coincidently reversed just 5 seconds later, it's all a bit of a mess. The film never really flows, it limps along, takes a sudden leap, then limps again. Brad Pitt isn't too bad but the supporting cast is pretty hopeless, the acting quality would barely compete with a daytime soap opera, and the elevator music soundtrack just makes thing worse. If you like a bit of culture and funky scenery then it might be worth a look, but otherwise Seven Years in Tibet will feel like seven years in solitary confinement.

    Maybe it's that fact that I have read the book 3 times, but having read other books and seen the corresponding films this one was particularly bad. It starts with the main character, Heinrich Harrer, played by Brad Pitt. I'd have expected much more of a world class actor. He doesn't behave like an alpinist, nor does he resemble an Austrian in general. However, in defence of Pitt, the screenplay is probably the worst bit of this film and as such probably a difficult task for any actor. When Harrer was invited to the premiere of the film, he mostly praised it, but only because he was a polite and humble man - much to the contrary what Becky Johnston (the screenplay author) made of him. She quite obviously had no idea about alpinism and didn't research Harrer's life. She doesn't even seem to have understood the book itself. The real book certainly wasn't about a lost son (Rolf) or a lost marriage, nor was it about any rivalry between alpinists (Aufschnaiter - Harrer). Harrer and Aufschnaiter survived a physically and mentally extremely exhausting escape over the Himalayas under deadly conditions with very limited gear where most of us probably would have died many times. The endurance of this incredible achievement is totally lost in the film. In Lhasa, it was mostly his awestruck confrontation with a hidden culture, which was quite contrary to the film or simply didn't get through to the audience. Anyone who has seen Werner Herzog's "Rescue Dawn", would agree that an escape story can be done much better with a much lower budget.

    Beautifully filmed and well scored, Seven Years in Tibet narrates the story of Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer's journey (both physical and spiritual), his experiences in Lhasa, and his friendship with the child Dalai Lama. Heinrich Harrer's transformation from an emotionally immature and egotistic narcissist to an enlightened and more sensitive man parallels the story of Buddha's path to enlightenment.. Buddhism's underlying doctrine is that of compassion and it offers it's adherents a way of living that will remedy the suffering of the human condition. Harrer's discontent is his suffering. Prior to his journey to Tibet, Harrer's marriage is falling apart and he openly resents Aufschnaiter, the leader of the expedition to the Himalayas. Through his friendship with the Dalai Lama and the detachment from his "European way of life", Harrer learns to leave behind his selfish tendencies. He grows to regret abandoning his pregnant wife in favor of his own ambitions and manages to overcome his jealousy of Aufschnaiter for marrying Pema Lhaki. The wisdom that he gains from the Dalai Lama and Buddhist teachings even drives him to leave his beloved Tibet to return to Austria in order to make amends with his wife and son. As he deals with the challenges of scaling Nanga Parbet (the ninth highest mountain range in the world and the death of dozens of mountaineers before him), as well as the political turmoil of World War 2 Europe, he so too deals with his own demons and, despite not formally converting to Buddhism, adapts the clarity of a Buddhist way of life.

    This movie is about a journey of a arrogant and selfish man named Heinrich Harrer(Brad Pitt) and after he is taken captive as a prisoner of war. And how he finds peace and compassion within himself. The beginning is fast paced and not developed enough, which is fine for a movie that has a long story to tell as this one. But it just wasn't engaging or got my interest, even if it's because it's to get Heinrich Harrer's character down. There is a long waiting period before Heinrich Harrer makes it to Tibet and than it's when the movie kick off and becomes heartfelt and touching. Brad Pitt was close to his prime when this movie came out and when it comes to appearance wise he has the charisma to carry the movie. His acting was decent but his Austrian accent just seemed way too forced in this. Sometimes I get used to actors or actresses fake accents but not this time around. The love triangle part of this movie bring out Heinrich's character but what makes this movie emotionally moving. Is Heinrich's relationship with Dalai Lama in Tibet. In fact this movie made me feel for the Tibetan people who are these really peaceful people that thinks of there "enemy as there greatest teacher...Because only an enemy can help develop patience and compassion." And especially felt for the Tibetan people when they started to get suppressed by the Chinese army. Although this movie doesn't entirely grab at the heartstrings it does have a bit of heart to it and is worth a watch. It isn't a great film but it's a good one. 7.4/10

He grows to regret abandoning his pregnant wife in favor of his own ambitions and manages to overcome his jealousy of Aufschnaiter for marrying Pema Lhaki. The wisdom that he gains from the Dalai Lama and Buddhist teachings even drives him to leave his beloved Tibet to return to Austria in order to make amends with his wife and son. As he deals with the challenges of scaling Nanga Parbet (the ninth highest mountain range in the world and the death of dozens of mountaineers before him), as well as the political turmoil of World War 2 Europe, he so too deals with his own demons and, despite not formally converting to Buddhism, adapts the clarity of a Buddhist way of life.

    This movie is about a journey of a arrogant and selfish man named Heinrich Harrer(Brad Pitt) and after he is taken captive as a prisoner of war. And how he finds peace and compassion within himself. The beginning is fast paced and not developed enough, which is fine for a movie that has a long story to tell as this one. But it just wasn't engaging or got my interest, even if it's because it's to get Heinrich Harrer's character down. There is a long waiting period before Heinrich Harrer makes it to Tibet and than it's when the movie kick off and becomes heartfelt and touching. Brad Pitt was close to his prime when this movie came out and when it comes to appearance wise he has the charisma to carry the movie. His acting was decent but his Austrian accent just seemed way too forced in this. Sometimes I get used to actors or actresses fake accents but not this time around. The love triangle part of this movie bring out Heinrich's character but what makes this movie emotionally moving. Is Heinrich's relationship with Dalai Lama in Tibet. In fact this movie made me feel for the Tibetan people who are these really peaceful people that thinks of there "enemy as there greatest teacher...Because only an enemy can help develop patience and compassion." And especially felt for the Tibetan people when they started to get suppressed by the Chinese army. Although this movie doesn't entirely grab at the heartstrings it does have a bit of heart to it and is worth a watch. It isn't a great film but it's a good one. 7.4/10

    Based on the book written by Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer that chronicles his experiences in Tibet between 1944 and 1951 during the Second World War;the interim period;and the Chinese People's Liberation Army's invasion of Tibet in 1950,Seven Years In Tibet tells the story of a man who undergoes character change that was prompted with one's relationship to the Dalai Lama. Brad Pitt stars as the arrogant Heinrich Harrer,a famed Austrian mountain climber who leaves behind his wife and infant son to head a Himalayan expedition in 1939, only to fall into the hands of Allied forces as a prisoner of war. He and a fellow escapee, Peter Aufschnaiter,played by David Thewlis, make their way to the Forbidden City in Tibet, where Peter finds a wife and Heinrich befriends the Western culture-obsessed teenage Dalai Lama,portrayed by Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk, the spiritual leader of his Buddhist nation. As Heinrich waits out the war, his friendship with the Dalai Lama begins to transform him from haughty to humble, but a crisis with China looms.The film ends with a series of title cards that list figures that quantify the death and destruction as a result of Chinese occupation. Harrer kept a good relationship with Dalai Lama after his flee from Tibet to India. The story was characterized as a road picture,epic and spiritual journey of Harrer.It is a beautiful film with a story so typical-yet-unusual coming-of-age of a man who becomes a better person.Although the relationship between Harrer and Dalai Lama was lacking,it manages to become interesting due to the extra-ordinary performance of Brad Pitt.Because of it,the film does not fall short in both satisfaction and entertainment despite this shortcoming.

    Ever since Ronald Colman raised the bar of expectation by his not so chance encounter with Shangri-La in the 1937 movie rendition of "Lost Horizon", we have been trying to find our way back. Thanks to movies like "Seven years in Tibet", we can focus on the real issues rather than paradise revisited. With the release of the movie version of Heinrich Harrer's "Seven Years in Tibet" we are presented with a different story - one less fairly tale...Jacque Annaud's...film allows us to move away from the fantasy created by "Lost Horizon"... Annaud succeeds in bringing Tibet to life, to make it more human, more real. As much as the story is Harrer's, it seems inevitable that the focus moves away from him and onto the Dalai Lama. The book reads like an outsider looking at things from the outside in. The focus of the book, is all Harrer. Luckily, film has an ability to visualize the books cannot ever provide - a real immediate feel. The movie is everything and it at times almost feels like it will slide into Indiana Jones. However, the power of Tibet saves it. It almost feel like Pitt and Thewlis are out of place. The real stars are the set, the landscape and the Nepalese extras. Filmed everywhere but Tibet, the film does give its western audience a real soft landing, one that they will not get with Scorsese's "Kundun"... Hollywood does need to supply a demand and we demand epic scenes, high priced talent, a sense of the exotic. As if east meets west and the fusion of the two is greater than the sum of the parts. For the attention to detail, I can't help but sing the praises. If you can stomach Pitt's fake Austrian accent, the film is a visual delight. It would be a tempting fantasy to hope that we can preserve it...

    Plot: The true story of an Austrian mountain climber called Heinrich Harrer and his experiences in Tibet, mainly his friendship with Dalai Lama at the time of China's invasion of Tibetan land. You'll love Seven Years In Tibet if: You want great cinematography aaaaaand that's it I honestly can't find any really good thing about it besides the wonderful scenery. The great snowy mountains and the barren fields of Tibet look wonderful, (although in reality what we see is Peru). What else? Nothing really while there isn't anything really bad in here, I can't think of anything good either You'll hate Seven Years In Tibet if: You want a movie that has a conclusion, is more historically accurate and if you expected a better adaptation of the book. What is the movie supposed to be about? Most people think it's the way Heinrich changes from a complete Nazi a$$ that doesn't care about anything to a humble, "changed" man through his relationship with Dalai Lama. The problem is that while that does happen we don't see how! How in the heck did he change? Why exactly Dalai Lama wanted to meet him? Because he knew a lot of things about the western world??? Others think that it was a movie that had to do with China's invasion in Tibet. Another failed attempt IMO. While I'm no historian I feel that the movie tends to have a propagandist style, with Tibetan monks and Dalai Lama portrayed as "angels" and Chinese as the evil invaders? Okay, lets say I'm stupid and didn't manage to get the point of the movie let's say there is something really good here. Unfortunately the pacing of the movie destroys that too. We see Heinrich in the beginning boarding a train, then we see Heinrich climbing the mountain, then we see him get caught by the British, then he escapes, then he climbs more mountains, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then then he meets Dalai Lama, he becomes a great guy and returns home. Sweeeeeet! FINAL VERDICT: And The Moral Of The Story Is? (3.2/10) [+] Very good cinematography with great mountain landscapes. [-] A story with a beginning but no real ending. Veeery slow pacing. Slight historical inaccuracies. Very different from the far better book. Also Check: American History X (1998)  Au Revoir Les Enfants (1987)  Defiance (2008)  Kundun (1997) P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say "I like\don't like this movie" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...

    I think this movie is great. It touches your heart and your soul. It helps to give faces to Tibetans and their plight. It speaks about the German invasion and an individual's struggle towards becoming themselves. I thought it was amazing. To see a man, who would not take no for an answer or accept that he could be held down. Continue to fight despite what others said and learning who he is gaining peace in his objectives towards life and achieving his goal. Planting the Tibetan Flag was an awesome contrast to the beginning when he was told to plant the flag with the swastika. The movie contained depth and broaden/confirmed my perception regarding why we are here. Maybe I am simple but I thought it was great. There is more to life than this, if I could give it all up and lead that lifestyle my life would be good. Only thing I hated to see was the oppression.

    This is a long one. Based on a true story about an Austrian mountaineer. Brad tries to climate the Himalayas and is imprisoned in a prisoner of war camp. He escapes and tries to travel through Tibet but is kicked out as foreigners are forbidden until he befriends the Dahli Lama. Part road picture, part epic, and part spiritual journey, Seven Years in Tibet is a beautiful film with a story so typical-yet-unusual that it could only have come from autobiography. Beautiful and unforgettable,If you have not seen this yet you should! loved it. This masterpiece, still makes me curious every time I see it. Brad Pitt does an amazing job portraying an Austrian, even down to his accent. The cinematography is extraordinary, and the direction is quite good. I love watching it every so often, and learning new things that I missed the times before. Overall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended. superb movie.

    This had the foundations to be something truly special. An Austrian mountain climber leaves a dying marriage to explore the Himalayas in British India, but with the onset of World War II is forced to flea through inhospitable terrain to Tibet where he is befriended by a doomed world leader. Fantastic, how could such a unique and complex plot go wrong? Well believe me, they found a way. 10 minutes into the movie and I'd already given up on the script, it was dull from the first line and barely improved after that, no point waiting for a witty or insightful remark because it isn't coming. Then there was the editing. Seemingly important scenes are over in a heartbeat while pointless scenes are dragged out. Moments that seem like big twists are immediately and coincidently reversed just 5 seconds later, it's all a bit of a mess. The film never really flows, it limps along, takes a sudden leap, then limps again. Brad Pitt isn't too bad but the supporting cast is pretty hopeless, the acting quality would barely compete with a daytime soap opera, and the elevator music soundtrack just makes thing worse. If you like a bit of culture and funky scenery then it might be worth a look, but otherwise Seven Years in Tibet will feel like seven years in solitary confinement.

    Maybe it's that fact that I have read the book 3 times, but having read other books and seen the corresponding films this one was particularly bad. It starts with the main character, Heinrich Harrer, played by Brad Pitt. I'd have expected much more of a world class actor. He doesn't behave like an alpinist, nor does he resemble an Austrian in general. However, in defence of Pitt, the screenplay is probably the worst bit of this film and as such probably a difficult task for any actor. When Harrer was invited to the premiere of the film, he mostly praised it, but only because he was a polite and humble man - much to the contrary what Becky Johnston (the screenplay author) made of him. She quite obviously had no idea about alpinism and didn't research Harrer's life. She doesn't even seem to have understood the book itself. The real book certainly wasn't about a lost son (Rolf) or a lost marriage, nor was it about any rivalry between alpinists (Aufschnaiter - Harrer). Harrer and Aufschnaiter survived a physically and mentally extremely exhausting escape over the Himalayas under deadly conditions with very limited gear where most of us probably would have died many times. The endurance of this incredible achievement is totally lost in the film. In Lhasa, it was mostly his awestruck confrontation with a hidden culture, which was quite contrary to the film or simply didn't get through to the audience. Anyone who has seen Werner Herzog's "Rescue Dawn", would agree that an escape story can be done much better with a much lower budget.

    Beautifully filmed and well scored, Seven Years in Tibet narrates the story of Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer's journey (both physical and spiritual), his experiences in Lhasa, and his friendship with the child Dalai Lama. Heinrich Harrer's transformation from an emotionally immature and egotistic narcissist to an enlightened and more sensitive man parallels the story of Buddha's path to enlightenment.. Buddhism's underlying doctrine is that of compassion and it offers it's adherents a way of living that will remedy the suffering of the human condition. Harrer's discontent is his suffering. Prior to his journey to Tibet, Harrer's marriage is falling apart and he openly resents Aufschnaiter, the leader of the expedition to the Himalayas. Through his friendship with the Dalai Lama and the detachment from his "European way of life", Harrer learns to leave behind his selfish tendencies. He grows to regret abandoning his pregnant wife in favor of his own ambitions and manages to overcome his jealousy of Aufschnaiter for marrying Pema Lhaki. The wisdom that he gains from the Dalai Lama and Buddhist teachings even drives him to leave his beloved Tibet to return to Austria in order to make amends with his wife and son. As he deals with the challenges of scaling Nanga Parbet (the ninth highest mountain range in the world and the death of dozens of mountaineers before him), as well as the political turmoil of World War 2 Europe, he so too deals with his own demons and, despite not formally converting to Buddhism, adapts the clarity of a Buddhist way of life.

    Maybe it's that fact that I have read the book 3 times, but having read other books and seen the corresponding films this one was particularly bad. It starts with the main character, Heinrich Harrer, played by Brad Pitt. I'd have expected much more of a world class actor. He doesn't behave like an alpinist, nor does he resemble an Austrian in general. However, in defence of Pitt, the screenplay is probably the worst bit of this film and as such probably a difficult task for any actor. When Harrer was invited to the premiere of the film, he mostly praised it, but only because he was a polite and humble man - much to the contrary what Becky Johnston (the screenplay author) made of him. She quite obviously had no idea about alpinism and didn't research Harrer's life. She doesn't even seem to have understood the book itself. The real book certainly wasn't about a lost son (Rolf) or a lost marriage, nor was it about any rivalry between alpinists (Aufschnaiter - Harrer). Harrer and Aufschnaiter survived a physically and mentally extremely exhausting escape over the Himalayas under deadly conditions with very limited gear where most of us probably would have died many times. The endurance of this incredible achievement is totally lost in the film. In Lhasa, it was mostly his awestruck confrontation with a hidden culture, which was quite contrary to the film or simply didn't get through to the audience. Anyone who has seen Werner Herzog's "Rescue Dawn", would agree that an escape story can be done much better with a much lower budget.

    Beautifully filmed and well scored, Seven Years in Tibet narrates the story of Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer's journey (both physical and spiritual), his experiences in Lhasa, and his friendship with the child Dalai Lama. Heinrich Harrer's transformation from an emotionally immature and egotistic narcissist to an enlightened and more sensitive man parallels the story of Buddha's path to enlightenment.. Buddhism's underlying doctrine is that of compassion and it offers it's adherents a way of living that will remedy the suffering of the human condition. Harrer's discontent is his suffering. Prior to his journey to Tibet, Harrer's marriage is falling apart and he openly resents Aufschnaiter, the leader of the expedition to the Himalayas. Through his friendship with the Dalai Lama and the detachment from his "European way of life", Harrer learns to leave behind his selfish tendencies. He grows to regret abandoning his pregnant wife in favor of his own ambitions and manages to overcome his jealousy of Aufschnaiter for marrying Pema Lhaki. The wisdom that he gains from the Dalai Lama and Buddhist teachings even drives him to leave his beloved Tibet to return to Austria in order to make amends with his wife and son. As he deals with the challenges of scaling Nanga Parbet (the ninth highest mountain range in the world and the death of dozens of mountaineers before him), as well as the political turmoil of World War 2 Europe, he so too deals with his own demons and, despite not formally converting to Buddhism, adapts the clarity of a Buddhist way of life.

    This movie is about a journey of a arrogant and selfish man named Heinrich Harrer(Brad Pitt) and after he is taken captive as a prisoner of war. And how he finds peace and compassion within himself. The beginning is fast paced and not developed enough, which is fine for a movie that has a long story to tell as this one. But it just wasn't engaging or got my interest, even if it's because it's to get Heinrich Harrer's character down. There is a long waiting period before Heinrich Harrer makes it to Tibet and than it's when the movie kick off and becomes heartfelt and touching. Brad Pitt was close to his prime when this movie came out and when it comes to appearance wise he has the charisma to carry the movie. His acting was decent but his Austrian accent just seemed way too forced in this. Sometimes I get used to actors or actresses fake accents but not this time around. The love triangle part of this movie bring out Heinrich's character but what makes this movie emotionally moving. Is Heinrich's relationship with Dalai Lama in Tibet. In fact this movie made me feel for the Tibetan people who are these really peaceful people that thinks of there "enemy as there greatest teacher...Because only an enemy can help develop patience and compassion." And especially felt for the Tibetan people when they started to get suppressed by the Chinese army. Although this movie doesn't entirely grab at the heartstrings it does have a bit of heart to it and is worth a watch. It isn't a great film but it's a good one. 7.4/10

    remarkable work. discover a meeting and an universe in gentle and wise way. define a reality. present metamorphose of a life. and, more important, give honest image of facts, without ordinaries ambitions.a film who confirms art of Brad Pitt far from any etiquette. who draws the real Tibet atmosphere out of desire to be a lesson or political answer. who suggest and build grace of colors, sound and silence key for understand a place as part of yourself. sure, it is not perfect. but, like many other exercise , it is a view about things. a profound view, sine ira et studio, but with subtle spirit of joy.this fact is important. and basis of a way to transform existence in precious value. because, it is not a Budist story or a page from a Nazi figure experiences. but only a confession. without rules. without ambition to be revelation. only testimony. and this is its great virtue of this remarkable adaptation.

    Based on the book written by Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer that chronicles his experiences in Tibet between 1944 and 1951 during the Second World War;the interim period;and the Chinese People's Liberation Army's invasion of Tibet in 1950,Seven Years In Tibet tells the story of a man who undergoes character change that was prompted with one's relationship to the Dalai Lama. Brad Pitt stars as the arrogant Heinrich Harrer,a famed Austrian mountain climber who leaves behind his wife and infant son to head a Himalayan expedition in 1939, only to fall into the hands of Allied forces as a prisoner of war. He and a fellow escapee, Peter Aufschnaiter,played by David Thewlis, make their way to the Forbidden City in Tibet, where Peter finds a wife and Heinrich befriends the Western culture-obsessed teenage Dalai Lama,portrayed by Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk, the spiritual leader of his Buddhist nation. As Heinrich waits out the war, his friendship with the Dalai Lama begins to transform him from haughty to humble, but a crisis with China looms.The film ends with a series of title cards that list figures that quantify the death and destruction as a result of Chinese occupation. Harrer kept a good relationship with Dalai Lama after his flee from Tibet to India. The story was characterized as a road picture,epic and spiritual journey of Harrer.It is a beautiful film with a story so typical-yet-unusual coming-of-age of a man who becomes a better person.Although the relationship between Harrer and Dalai Lama was lacking,it manages to become interesting due to the extra-ordinary performance of Brad Pitt.Because of it,the film does not fall short in both satisfaction and entertainment despite this shortcoming.

    Ever since Ronald Colman raised the bar of expectation by his not so chance encounter with Shangri-La in the 1937 movie rendition of "Lost Horizon", we have been trying to find our way back. Thanks to movies like "Seven years in Tibet", we can focus on the real issues rather than paradise revisited. With the release of the movie version of Heinrich Harrer's "Seven Years in Tibet" we are presented with a different story - one less fairly tale...Jacque Annaud's...film allows us to move away from the fantasy created by "Lost Horizon"... Annaud succeeds in bringing Tibet to life, to make it more human, more real. As much as the story is Harrer's, it seems inevitable that the focus moves away from him and onto the Dalai Lama. The book reads like an outsider looking at things from the outside in. The focus of the book, is all Harrer. Luckily, film has an ability to visualize the books cannot ever provide - a real immediate feel. The movie is everything and it at times almost feels like it will slide into Indiana Jones. However, the power of Tibet saves it. It almost feel like Pitt and Thewlis are out of place. The real stars are the set, the landscape and the Nepalese extras. Filmed everywhere but Tibet, the film does give its western audience a real soft landing, one that they will not get with Scorsese's "Kundun"... Hollywood does need to supply a demand and we demand epic scenes, high priced talent, a sense of the exotic. As if east meets west and the fusion of the two is greater than the sum of the parts. For the attention to detail, I can't help but sing the praises. If you can stomach Pitt's fake Austrian accent, the film is a visual delight. It would be a tempting fantasy to hope that we can preserve it...

    Plot: The true story of an Austrian mountain climber called Heinrich Harrer and his experiences in Tibet, mainly his friendship with Dalai Lama at the time of China's invasion of Tibetan land. You'll love Seven Years In Tibet if: You want great cinematography aaaaaand that's it I honestly can't find any really good thing about it besides the wonderful scenery. The great snowy mountains and the barren fields of Tibet look wonderful, (although in reality what we see is Peru). What else? Nothing really while there isn't anything really bad in here, I can't think of anything good either You'll hate Seven Years In Tibet if: You want a movie that has a conclusion, is more historically accurate and if you expected a better adaptation of the book. What is the movie supposed to be about? Most people think it's the way Heinrich changes from a complete Nazi a$$ that doesn't care about anything to a humble, "changed" man through his relationship with Dalai Lama. The problem is that while that does happen we don't see how! How in the heck did he change? Why exactly Dalai Lama wanted to meet him? Because he knew a lot of things about the western world??? Others think that it was a movie that had to do with China's invasion in Tibet. Another failed attempt IMO. While I'm no historian I feel that the movie tends to have a propagandist style, with Tibetan monks and Dalai Lama portrayed as "angels" and Chinese as the evil invaders? Okay, lets say I'm stupid and didn't manage to get the point of the movie let's say there is something really good here. Unfortunately the pacing of the movie destroys that too. We see Heinrich in the beginning boarding a train, then we see Heinrich climbing the mountain, then we see him get caught by the British, then he escapes, then he climbs more mountains, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then then he meets Dalai Lama, he becomes a great guy and returns home. Sweeeeeet! FINAL VERDICT: And The Moral Of The Story Is? (3.2/10) [+] Very good cinematography with great mountain landscapes. [-] A story with a beginning but no real ending. Veeery slow pacing. Slight historical inaccuracies. Very different from the far better book. Also Check: American History X (1998)  Au Revoir Les Enfants (1987)  Defiance (2008)  Kundun (1997) P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say "I like\don't like this movie" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...

    I think this movie is great. It touches your heart and your soul. It helps to give faces to Tibetans and their plight. It speaks about the German invasion and an individual's struggle towards becoming themselves. I thought it was amazing. To see a man, who would not take no for an answer or accept that he could be held down. Continue to fight despite what others said and learning who he is gaining peace in his objectives towards life and achieving his goal. Planting the Tibetan Flag was an awesome contrast to the beginning when he was told to plant the flag with the swastika. The movie contained depth and broaden/confirmed my perception regarding why we are here. Maybe I am simple but I thought it was great. There is more to life than this, if I could give it all up and lead that lifestyle my life would be good. Only thing I hated to see was the oppression.

    This is a long one. Based on a true story about an Austrian mountaineer. Brad tries to climate the Himalayas and is imprisoned in a prisoner of war camp. He escapes and tries to travel through Tibet but is kicked out as foreigners are forbidden until he befriends the Dahli Lama. Part road picture, part epic, and part spiritual journey, Seven Years in Tibet is a beautiful film with a story so typical-yet-unusual that it could only have come from autobiography. Beautiful and unforgettable,If you have not seen this yet you should! loved it. This masterpiece, still makes me curious every time I see it. Brad Pitt does an amazing job portraying an Austrian, even down to his accent. The cinematography is extraordinary, and the direction is quite good. I love watching it every so often, and learning new things that I missed the times before. Overall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended. superb movie.
