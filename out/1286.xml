 <sinopse>
  A budding romance between a ballet master and a tapdancer becomes complicated when rumours surface that they're already married.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Ballet star Pete "Petrov" Peters arranges to cross the Atlantic aboard the same ship as the dancer he's fallen for but barely knows, musical star Linda Keene. By the time the ocean liner reaches New York, a little white lie has churned through the rumor mill and turned into a hot gossip item: that the two celebrities are secretly married.

    The story is rather thin and silly and Ketti Gallian's performance came across as vapid; the rest however is sheer pleasure. The film is beautifully shot with extravagant, if not quite as sophisticated as Top Hat and particularly Swing Time, production values, particularly apparent in Let's Call the Whole Thing Off. George and Ira Gershwin's score and songs don't disappoint either, really quite wonderful actually. Standing out were the catchy Let's Call the Whole Thing Off and the touchingly melancholic They Can't Take That Away From Me. The choreography dazzles and shows great energy and poise, just seeing Fred and Ginger in roller skates for Let's Call the Whole Thing Off makes one envious of how they were able to do that and make it seem so easy. The dialogue has a real warmth and wit, the dialogue during the jail scene is just hilarious and that scene came across as the best from a comedic point of view, and the gags and such are good-natured and enjoyably daft. Shall We Dance is not without heart either, it is very difficult not to be moved by You Can't Take That Away From Me. Fred Astaire is immensely charming and likable and dances a dream as always, it more than makes up for that he's not all that convincing as a Russian. Ginger Rogers looks gorgeous and interacts and dances with Astaire wonderfully, you are not quite as emotionally invested in Linda Keene as you are with some of her other characters but Rogers still gives everything she's got. In supporting roles, Eric Blore was a joy and provided some of the film's funniest moments(the aforementioned jail scene), though Edward Everett Horton and Jerome Cowan are very enjoyable as well. To conclude, a great piece of escapism. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    First of all, Fred Astaire is far too American to be believable as a Russian dancer named "Petrov", and the squabbling he goes through with Ginger Rogers (as an off-key star of musical revues) is a repeat of everything that they've done in their movies up until now. But when you've got Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore and RKO's top art decco set directors, that's enough to distract you from the silliness of the plot. Add on songs by the Gershwins (the first of two films where they collaborated together) and all those reluctant complaints seem redundant. The basic plot has Astaire and Rogers being mistaken in the press as married, and before you know it, they're hotter than Brad and Angelina. Ginger wants no part of this, but Freddie has a few tricks up his sleeve to win her for good. Thanks to George and Ira's music (some of George's last), it works. Fred woos her to "They Can't Take That Away From Me" (which he would repeat 12 years later in "The Barkleys of Broadway") and even has a bunch of dancers with Ginger masks prancing around him in the title number. What tough Broadway star wouldn't fall for that? The lyrics for Ira are very clever too, particularly in "They All Laughed" and "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off". As visually exciting as the ship set song "Let Yourself Go" is, what boiler room looks like a Broadway set? Horton & Blore provide droll humor, and exchange some great lines. All they are missing is Franklin Pangborn.

    One of the things about the RKO musicals is that, though they seem dated now, at the time they were the very epitome of chic modernity. Or at least, that's what they aimed to be. Shall We Dance begins by lambasting the "stuffy" world of ballet in favour of the "fun" of jazz. The Fred and Ginger series was itself starting to run out of steam a bit by now, and it's hard not to see this as part of an increasing desperation to seem trendy and relevant. Shall We Dance is arguably the most prestigious of the Astaire-Rogers musicals, with several large-scale dance numbers and music by the brothers Gershwin, high priests of early jazz. The big dance routines are all very well, but it seems a shame the Shall We Dance relies upon them so much when the magic of these pictures was in the simple couple numbers. The Gershwin contribution is of greater significance, and there are some lovely songs included here. George Gershwin's tendency to incorporate classical music forms is actually rather appropriate for the theme of ballet dancer turning to tap. In trying to keep the formula interesting, the writers of these musicals were always trying to come up with new things for Astaire to do. His ability to dance comically had already transformed the dance musical, but now there is more focus on his comic acting. His occasional delving into the extravagant Russian stereotype seems like a spiritual ancestor of Harrison Ford's Scottish Laird routine in Last Crusade. It's not exactly the sort of thing to kick off a career as a comedian, but it is amusing through its sheer badness. Unfortunately, it looks like many of Fred's shenanigans here were at the expense of decent screen moments for Ginger. Keeping some consistency in the series are appearances by Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore, who are as wonderful as ever. Long-term Astaire-Rogers director Mark Sandrich brings his usual lyrical touch to proceedings. His flair with elaborate long takes is highlighted in the nice flowing opening scene, introducing Fred's "Petrov" alter-ego and Horton's character via paintings, in one sweeping camera move. His real forte was in beautifully discrete introductions to songs. "They Can't Take That Away from Me" is established with a long static dialogue scene, Ginger with her back to Fred. When Astaire slides into the song, the shot and angle don't change and it just seems a totally natural progression of the scene. Towards the end of it he throws in a pay-off with an emotional close-up of Rogers. Done like this, the number is worth more than all the over-sized dance-offs put together. All in all Shall We Dance is a fairly run-of-the-mill Astaire-Rogers musical. Falling short of classic status, it's really just a twee bit of 30s nostalgia Â– the music, the story, those big white sets like the interior of some art deco spaceship. It's far from bad, but the series had by now seen its best days.

    In recent years, the title of this film has become overshadowed by two modern movies of the same name: a superb Japanese movie and its American remake, respectively entitled Shall We Dansu? and Shall We Dance. Yet this 1937 classic is worth revisiting not only for its famous Gershwin numbers, but as the last of a series of classic-format films between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Deeply flawed, yet the tremendous effort poured into its production is evident. And, when viewed as part of a series, touchingly beautiful. Utilising talent from their earlier films, Shall We Dance pushes the established formula of light romantic farce coupled with stunning dance routines. But here are many innovations and subtle references to delight fans. At the end of their previous film together (Swing Time), Fred serenaded Ginger with the song Never Gonna Dance, so Shall We Dance? suggests a delightful comeback through association. Their respective characters have grown through successive films, as has their on screen relationship. Now, for the first time, both play fully fledged divas in their own right. Fred is Petrov, a Russian ballet star, and Ginger is Linda, a celebrated jazz dancer. Many of the gags involve rumours about the characters being secretly married or having children. By way of a complex plot, half conducted on a transatlantic liner, the couple do actually get married for the first time in their films together. Copy picture The star personas of both Astaire and Rogers have been carefully managed by the studios since their debut together in Flying Down to Rio (1933). Fred woos her with increasing conviction or intensity in each successive movie. To suspend disbelief effectively, the audience has to be thoroughly confused for a while about the nature of their relationship (in real life, both Astaire and Rogers are married to other people at this time). The on screen characters are not married at the start of the story Â– Fred is pursuing Ginger, as usual. But an offhand comment by Petrov to an over-persistent admirer (to the effect that he and Linda are secretly married) is blown up by the newspapers in the story. The only way they can dispel rumours is to get a divorce Â– which means they first have to get married. In terms of dance routines, most things had been done already, so Shall We Dance has to come up with something new. One idea is a duet on roller skates. Depending on which account we read, it took filming up to fifty takes to complete (unusually, as Fred would mostly insist on a single one). It's filmed in Central Park, and the idea is to make it look like something people would naturally be doing. It's also the longest dance Fred and Ginger have together in the film, and is made even more enjoyable by their singing Let's Call the Whole Thing Off. Another innovation is the way the story line is tied up. (Note Â– a light spoiler follows, but I think it's worth knowing what is coming in this case, so as not to miss the full effect). Petrov, now distraught that Linda won't dance with him, has a choreographed scene where he serenades with numerous showgirls who wear Linda masks. This in itself recalls earlier scenes involving a dummy positioned next to a sleeping Petrov, to 'prove' in the tabloids that they are married; and also in a flick-book he has that creates moving images of Linda. Unbeknown to Petrov, Linda yearns for them to be together. She insists on being taken backstage. Petrov's dance involves unmasking the lookalikes only to find that none are the real Linda. When he touches the real Linda's chin, he finds it is not a mask but really her. She extends her hand and, whoever the 'real' Petrov and Linda have been (they both have several identities even within the film), the audience is satisfied that the real living couple finally have a dance of love. Almost all the emotion of the film has been saved for this moment. Shall We Dance not only reprises two established stars; it examines the real life pressures and glare of publicity facing them. They were both under pressure: during filming, Ginger Rogers received a real-life extortion notice and a death threat to her mother. The movie's final dance scene maybe hints at something that is beyond words, beyond the glare of the limelight, and something eternally personal Â– as the song implies: "They Can't Take That Away from Me." The film's weaknesses include living up to expectations when a formula has peaked. In earlier pairings, Fred's character woos Ginger through dance rather than words. Here, they enjoy some comedy together but there are maybe one too many dance solos. The plot and characterisation has weaknesses too Â– Astaire is a very accomplished dancer performing balletic moves, but he was the first to admit he is no ballet star. Dance fans may feel unconvinced (similarly, the songs have been covered by much more competent singers). One of the main dance routines sees Harriet Hoctor, not Ginger, imported to dance with Fred Â– largely on account of her ability to tap through remarkable back-bends. Shall We Dance lacks much of the natural dance chemistry between Fred and Ginger displayed in earlier films, but it is an outstanding piece of their film history that should not be missed.

    This must be judged one of the lesser examples of Fred and Ginger's work. Not that it's so poor it should be avoided. It's mostly that here they don't get together and dance often or intricately enough. The story makes little sense, but then none of their plots ever did. They're beside the point. But, anyway, this is the one in which Astaire imitates a Russian ballet dancer. George Gershwin was finally seduced into writing songs for a movie but the producers were wary. George had a tendency to write classical music, the kiss of death, even with jazz elements. He had to telegram the producers with a reassuring message that he was determined to "write hits." As it turned out, the tunes were pleasant enough, including "Slap That Bass" (in the simulacrum of a ship's engine room), and the title tune. Two of the songs became standards: "They Can't Take That Away From Me" and "Let's Call The Whole Thing Off". (You say tomayto and I say tomah-to.) In many ways, the most inventive tune has no lyrics at all. It's called "Promenade" and appears when Astaire and Rogers walk their dogs on the deck of an ocean liner. And if you've ever wondered what the design style known as Art Deco was, you should definitely check this movie out because the style is here in all its extravagance in the production design by Van Nest Polglase, who by this time was having trouble with the bottle -- the white sets and furniture, the frosted glass with etched deer, the uninterpretable curlicues, and all the rest of it. It's often claimed that it Polglase's sets, all the telephones and their cords were white. It's a bloody lie. The telephones here are silver. Anyway, Gershwin did manage to avoid anything resembling classical music -- a good idea since neither dancer was trained in ballet -- except for one number featuring Harriet Hoctor, a former Ziegfield Follies entertainer. OMG, what a woman. She dances well enough, fingertips aflutter, more skillfully and more flamboyantly feminine than Ginger Rogers, but then she does this THING with her back. En point, she bends backwards into such a lengthy arc that her head almost touches the floor -- and then she repeatedly taps the top of her head with the toe of her ballet slipper. It's a shtick that belongs in an out take from "The Exorcist." There's an earlier number with Astaire and Rogers on roller skates but I could never find much grace in roller skating. It begins slowly. It's an hour almost before the two leads dance together. And the end has dozens of women dancing around wearing masks of Ginger Rogers' face. The movie didn't make as much money as earlier outings. Time for something new -- but what? The pair tried a musical biography of a pair of real dancers whose time had long passed, Vernon and Irene Castle. Maybe what they needed was a stronger and funnier plot line. Rogers never got one in a musical. Astaire had only one, "The Bandwagon" in the early 50s. I remember when Ginger Rogers passed away. She merited one or two lines in Newsweek, hardly a whisper. It was fifty years or more since her heyday and Americans have little interest in vernacular history.

    While in Paris, the famous dancer Pete "Petrov" Peters (Fred Astaire) meets the also famous tap dancer Linda Keene (Ginger Rogers) and he makes fun with her pretending that he is a Russian ballet master. He immediately falls in love with her and when he learns that she will travel to New York in an ocean liner, her arranges with his producer Jeffrey Baird (Edward Everett Horton) to travel in the same ship as Linda. In the departure, the annoying dancer and former affair of Petrov, Lady Denise Tarrington (Ketti Gallian), comes to the harbor and Petrov lies to her, telling that he has secretly married Linda, to get rid off Denise. However, Denise sends a telegram to the ship congratulating the couple and the lie turns into a gossip to the press. Now the lives of Petrov and Linda get very complicated with the situation. "Shall We Dance" is another naive film of the couple Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, with delightful confusion and musical numbers. The gags are dated but funny and the film is a pleasant entertaining for cinema and dance lovers. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Vamos Dan&ccedil;ar?" ("Shall We Dance?")

    Peter P Peters is an American ballet dancer who's known as Petrov.He wants to blend classical ballet with modern jazz, and then when he sees the picture of tap dancer Linda Keene, he immediately falls in love with her.Before they know it, they're married.Or at least the press thinks so.Shall We Dance from 1937 is directed by Mark Sandrich.Its producer is Pandro S. Berman.Behind the music are the brothers George and Ira Gershwin.This is the seventh of the ten Astaire-Rogers movies.The chemistry between the leading couple works, as always.Edward Everett Horton plays Jeffrey Baird.Eric Blore is Cecil Flintridge.James Cowan plays Arthur Miller.Ketti Gallian is Lady Denise Tarrington.The movie has some great comedy and musical bits.It's quite amusing when Fred pretends to be the Russian guy to Ginger, doing the accent and all.It's amazing to watch Fred doing the tap dance routine in a ship's engine room to the song "Slap That Bass".The song "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off" works and doing the tap dance on an ice-rink wearing roller blades.In one memorable scene Fred dances with many Gingers, only one being real.This movie is very entertaining, like any Fred and Ginger movie is.

    After "The Gay Divorc&eacute;e," the first starring vehicle for Astaire and Rogers, established the formula of breezy mixture of musical numbers and comedy, the duo kept appearing in films that varied the formula only slightly, and so it goes here. This one features the music of Gershwin, including "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off," "They All Laughed," and "They Can't Take That Away from Me," and Horton and Blore once again provide the laughs. It's pleasant enough, but falls short compared to the likes of "Top Hat" and "Swing Time." While the roller skate routine is fun, this one lacks a signature number. The script is uninspired and the comedy is forced.

    Ballet master on an ocean liner from Paris to New York City inadvertently starts a rumor that he is a newly-married man; the manager of a hot-tempered American dancer also on-board exploits his client as the would-be betrothed strictly for the publicity. Lackluster Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical-comedy has about enough plot for a short subject. The singing and dancing are wonderful (including a famous sequence on roller skates); however, with so little connection between the two stars, the romantic angle of the picture never quite comes to life. Rogers is in a perpetual foul mood throughout--and when Astaire dances solo, playing right to the camera, it smacks of ostentation. The George and Ira Gershwin songs (including the Oscar-nominated "They Can't Take That Away From Me") are a nice compensation for the lack of sparks. The RKO sets gleam with artificiality, while Edward Everett Horton and funny Eric Blore supply the wacky comedic asides. ** from ****

    The big takeaway on Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers is how well they danced together. My big takeaway from "Shall We Dance" is how well they acted. It's one thing to give a good performance in a musical like "Carousel" or "Singing In The Rain", and quite another to deliver amid the creaky jokes, plummy patter, and contrived plot twists that make up "Shall We Dance". But they do, and thanks to them, the show turns out not only okay but rather fine. Astaire is a faux-Russian ballet dancer, Petrov, who dreams of pairing up with celebrated tap dancer Linda Keene (Rogers) both on-stage and off. Linda just wants to retire, but Petrov's earnestness begins to win her over - until she is led to believe he is using her. She leaves him just as word spreads that the two are married (and really spreads, in the form of front-page news stories and radio flashes), forcing them to face a surreal prospect. "We're the only people in the world who don't think we're married!" Linda exclaims. People watching "Shall We Dance" for the first time need patience. Astaire and Rogers don't dance for an hour, their one musical moment all that time involving walking a dog around a ship in time to a musical theme (provided by one George Gershwin, who did the score with his lyricist brother Ira). Matters are too often dominated by Edward Everett Horton's over-the-top eye rolls and leaden asides as Petrov's snooty, disapproving manager. Later on William Brisbane arrives as Linda's rich-guy suitor, adding more overbaked ham to the menu. But Astaire keeps his end up, dancing to a skipping record or later overplaying a mock Russian accent in his first face-to-face with Linda. "You don't want to dance with the great Petrov," he declares, playing up a Slavic superiority trip. "Don't be a silly horse." The way he elongates that last "o" is positively indecent. Some reviewers here say Rogers seems bored in this film. She's playing a withdrawn character, though, and does give off passion when called upon. A big musical moment between her and Astaire, when he declares "They Can't Take That Away From Me", is a remarkable duet despite the fact she doesn't sing a note, just looks off with tear-filled eyes. Yet she gets the song's one close-up, and rightly so. When they have their first performance in front of an audience and he dances up a storm by way of an introduction, the look on her face is priceless. "What am I supposed to do?" she deadpans. Give director Mark Sandrich credit for keeping things light. Too light at times, like when Linda's manager somehow gets a photo of the couple in bed together by using a manikin of her he just happens to have in his closet (better I guess we don't know why he does). Sandrich does make the good scenes better with doses of gentle humor, like the capper to a roller-skating dance that is the movie's best moment. There are some nice dissolves from scene to scene, like a flip-book view of Linda dancing that melts into the real thing. Watching this the first time, the minutes stretched like rubber. The second time things flew much faster, because I knew what I wanted to see and could look forward to its arrival. I guess audiences of the 1930s had that expectation built in, one reason perhaps why these movies were so popular and no one cared when they were a bit inane.

His flair with elaborate long takes is highlighted in the nice flowing opening scene, introducing Fred's "Petrov" alter-ego and Horton's character via paintings, in one sweeping camera move. His real forte was in beautifully discrete introductions to songs. "They Can't Take That Away from Me" is established with a long static dialogue scene, Ginger with her back to Fred. When Astaire slides into the song, the shot and angle don't change and it just seems a totally natural progression of the scene. Towards the end of it he throws in a pay-off with an emotional close-up of Rogers. Done like this, the number is worth more than all the over-sized dance-offs put together. All in all Shall We Dance is a fairly run-of-the-mill Astaire-Rogers musical. Falling short of classic status, it's really just a twee bit of 30s nostalgia Â– the music, the story, those big white sets like the interior of some art deco spaceship. It's far from bad, but the series had by now seen its best days.

    In recent years, the title of this film has become overshadowed by two modern movies of the same name: a superb Japanese movie and its American remake, respectively entitled Shall We Dansu? and Shall We Dance. Yet this 1937 classic is worth revisiting not only for its famous Gershwin numbers, but as the last of a series of classic-format films between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Deeply flawed, yet the tremendous effort poured into its production is evident. And, when viewed as part of a series, touchingly beautiful. Utilising talent from their earlier films, Shall We Dance pushes the established formula of light romantic farce coupled with stunning dance routines. But here are many innovations and subtle references to delight fans. At the end of their previous film together (Swing Time), Fred serenaded Ginger with the song Never Gonna Dance, so Shall We Dance? suggests a delightful comeback through association. Their respective characters have grown through successive films, as has their on screen relationship. Now, for the first time, both play fully fledged divas in their own right. Fred is Petrov, a Russian ballet star, and Ginger is Linda, a celebrated jazz dancer. Many of the gags involve rumours about the characters being secretly married or having children. By way of a complex plot, half conducted on a transatlantic liner, the couple do actually get married for the first time in their films together. Copy picture The star personas of both Astaire and Rogers have been carefully managed by the studios since their debut together in Flying Down to Rio (1933). Fred woos her with increasing conviction or intensity in each successive movie. To suspend disbelief effectively, the audience has to be thoroughly confused for a while about the nature of their relationship (in real life, both Astaire and Rogers are married to other people at this time). The on screen characters are not married at the start of the story Â– Fred is pursuing Ginger, as usual. But an offhand comment by Petrov to an over-persistent admirer (to the effect that he and Linda are secretly married) is blown up by the newspapers in the story. The only way they can dispel rumours is to get a divorce Â– which means they first have to get married. In terms of dance routines, most things had been done already, so Shall We Dance has to come up with something new. One idea is a duet on roller skates. Depending on which account we read, it took filming up to fifty takes to complete (unusually, as Fred would mostly insist on a single one). It's filmed in Central Park, and the idea is to make it look like something people would naturally be doing. It's also the longest dance Fred and Ginger have together in the film, and is made even more enjoyable by their singing Let's Call the Whole Thing Off. Another innovation is the way the story line is tied up. (Note Â– a light spoiler follows, but I think it's worth knowing what is coming in this case, so as not to miss the full effect). Petrov, now distraught that Linda won't dance with him, has a choreographed scene where he serenades with numerous showgirls who wear Linda masks. This in itself recalls earlier scenes involving a dummy positioned next to a sleeping Petrov, to 'prove' in the tabloids that they are married; and also in a flick-book he has that creates moving images of Linda. Unbeknown to Petrov, Linda yearns for them to be together. She insists on being taken backstage. Petrov's dance involves unmasking the lookalikes only to find that none are the real Linda. When he touches the real Linda's chin, he finds it is not a mask but really her. She extends her hand and, whoever the 'real' Petrov and Linda have been (they both have several identities even within the film), the audience is satisfied that the real living couple finally have a dance of love. Almost all the emotion of the film has been saved for this moment. Shall We Dance not only reprises two established stars; it examines the real life pressures and glare of publicity facing them. They were both under pressure: during filming, Ginger Rogers received a real-life extortion notice and a death threat to her mother. The movie's final dance scene maybe hints at something that is beyond words, beyond the glare of the limelight, and something eternally personal Â– as the song implies: "They Can't Take That Away from Me." The film's weaknesses include living up to expectations when a formula has peaked. In earlier pairings, Fred's character woos Ginger through dance rather than words. Here, they enjoy some comedy together but there are maybe one too many dance solos. The plot and characterisation has weaknesses too Â– Astaire is a very accomplished dancer performing balletic moves, but he was the first to admit he is no ballet star. Dance fans may feel unconvinced (similarly, the songs have been covered by much more competent singers). One of the main dance routines sees Harriet Hoctor, not Ginger, imported to dance with Fred Â– largely on account of her ability to tap through remarkable back-bends. Shall We Dance lacks much of the natural dance chemistry between Fred and Ginger displayed in earlier films, but it is an outstanding piece of their film history that should not be missed.

    This must be judged one of the lesser examples of Fred and Ginger's work. Not that it's so poor it should be avoided. It's mostly that here they don't get together and dance often or intricately enough. The story makes little sense, but then none of their plots ever did. They're beside the point. But, anyway, this is the one in which Astaire imitates a Russian ballet dancer. George Gershwin was finally seduced into writing songs for a movie but the producers were wary. George had a tendency to write classical music, the kiss of death, even with jazz elements. He had to telegram the producers with a reassuring message that he was determined to "write hits." As it turned out, the tunes were pleasant enough, including "Slap That Bass" (in the simulacrum of a ship's engine room), and the title tune. Two of the songs became standards: "They Can't Take That Away From Me" and "Let's Call The Whole Thing Off". (You say tomayto and I say tomah-to.) In many ways, the most inventive tune has no lyrics at all. It's called "Promenade" and appears when Astaire and Rogers walk their dogs on the deck of an ocean liner. And if you've ever wondered what the design style known as Art Deco was, you should definitely check this movie out because the style is here in all its extravagance in the production design by Van Nest Polglase, who by this time was having trouble with the bottle -- the white sets and furniture, the frosted glass with etched deer, the uninterpretable curlicues, and all the rest of it. It's often claimed that it Polglase's sets, all the telephones and their cords were white. It's a bloody lie. The telephones here are silver. Anyway, Gershwin did manage to avoid anything resembling classical music -- a good idea since neither dancer was trained in ballet -- except for one number featuring Harriet Hoctor, a former Ziegfield Follies entertainer. OMG, what a woman. She dances well enough, fingertips aflutter, more skillfully and more flamboyantly feminine than Ginger Rogers, but then she does this THING with her back. En point, she bends backwards into such a lengthy arc that her head almost touches the floor -- and then she repeatedly taps the top of her head with the toe of her ballet slipper. It's a shtick that belongs in an out take from "The Exorcist." There's an earlier number with Astaire and Rogers on roller skates but I could never find much grace in roller skating. It begins slowly. It's an hour almost before the two leads dance together. And the end has dozens of women dancing around wearing masks of Ginger Rogers' face. The movie didn't make as much money as earlier outings. Time for something new -- but what? The pair tried a musical biography of a pair of real dancers whose time had long passed, Vernon and Irene Castle. Maybe what they needed was a stronger and funnier plot line. Rogers never got one in a musical. Astaire had only one, "The Bandwagon" in the early 50s. I remember when Ginger Rogers passed away. She merited one or two lines in Newsweek, hardly a whisper. It was fifty years or more since her heyday and Americans have little interest in vernacular history.

    While in Paris, the famous dancer Pete "Petrov" Peters (Fred Astaire) meets the also famous tap dancer Linda Keene (Ginger Rogers) and he makes fun with her pretending that he is a Russian ballet master. He immediately falls in love with her and when he learns that she will travel to New York in an ocean liner, her arranges with his producer Jeffrey Baird (Edward Everett Horton) to travel in the same ship as Linda. In the departure, the annoying dancer and former affair of Petrov, Lady Denise Tarrington (Ketti Gallian), comes to the harbor and Petrov lies to her, telling that he has secretly married Linda, to get rid off Denise. However, Denise sends a telegram to the ship congratulating the couple and the lie turns into a gossip to the press. Now the lives of Petrov and Linda get very complicated with the situation. "Shall We Dance" is another naive film of the couple Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, with delightful confusion and musical numbers. The gags are dated but funny and the film is a pleasant entertaining for cinema and dance lovers. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Vamos Dan&ccedil;ar?" ("Shall We Dance?")

    Peter P Peters is an American ballet dancer who's known as Petrov.He wants to blend classical ballet with modern jazz, and then when he sees the picture of tap dancer Linda Keene, he immediately falls in love with her.Before they know it, they're married.Or at least the press thinks so.Shall We Dance from 1937 is directed by Mark Sandrich.Its producer is Pandro S. Berman.Behind the music are the brothers George and Ira Gershwin.This is the seventh of the ten Astaire-Rogers movies.The chemistry between the leading couple works, as always.Edward Everett Horton plays Jeffrey Baird.Eric Blore is Cecil Flintridge.James Cowan plays Arthur Miller.Ketti Gallian is Lady Denise Tarrington.The movie has some great comedy and musical bits.It's quite amusing when Fred pretends to be the Russian guy to Ginger, doing the accent and all.It's amazing to watch Fred doing the tap dance routine in a ship's engine room to the song "Slap That Bass".The song "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off" works and doing the tap dance on an ice-rink wearing roller blades.In one memorable scene Fred dances with many Gingers, only one being real.This movie is very entertaining, like any Fred and Ginger movie is.

    After "The Gay Divorc&eacute;e," the first starring vehicle for Astaire and Rogers, established the formula of breezy mixture of musical numbers and comedy, the duo kept appearing in films that varied the formula only slightly, and so it goes here. This one features the music of Gershwin, including "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off," "They All Laughed," and "They Can't Take That Away from Me," and Horton and Blore once again provide the laughs. It's pleasant enough, but falls short compared to the likes of "Top Hat" and "Swing Time." While the roller skate routine is fun, this one lacks a signature number. The script is uninspired and the comedy is forced.

    Ballet master on an ocean liner from Paris to New York City inadvertently starts a rumor that he is a newly-married man; the manager of a hot-tempered American dancer also on-board exploits his client as the would-be betrothed strictly for the publicity. Lackluster Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical-comedy has about enough plot for a short subject. The singing and dancing are wonderful (including a famous sequence on roller skates); however, with so little connection between the two stars, the romantic angle of the picture never quite comes to life. Rogers is in a perpetual foul mood throughout--and when Astaire dances solo, playing right to the camera, it smacks of ostentation. The George and Ira Gershwin songs (including the Oscar-nominated "They Can't Take That Away From Me") are a nice compensation for the lack of sparks. The RKO sets gleam with artificiality, while Edward Everett Horton and funny Eric Blore supply the wacky comedic asides. ** from ****

    The big takeaway on Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers is how well they danced together. My big takeaway from "Shall We Dance" is how well they acted. It's one thing to give a good performance in a musical like "Carousel" or "Singing In The Rain", and quite another to deliver amid the creaky jokes, plummy patter, and contrived plot twists that make up "Shall We Dance". But they do, and thanks to them, the show turns out not only okay but rather fine. Astaire is a faux-Russian ballet dancer, Petrov, who dreams of pairing up with celebrated tap dancer Linda Keene (Rogers) both on-stage and off. Linda just wants to retire, but Petrov's earnestness begins to win her over - until she is led to believe he is using her. She leaves him just as word spreads that the two are married (and really spreads, in the form of front-page news stories and radio flashes), forcing them to face a surreal prospect. "We're the only people in the world who don't think we're married!" Linda exclaims. People watching "Shall We Dance" for the first time need patience. Astaire and Rogers don't dance for an hour, their one musical moment all that time involving walking a dog around a ship in time to a musical theme (provided by one George Gershwin, who did the score with his lyricist brother Ira). Matters are too often dominated by Edward Everett Horton's over-the-top eye rolls and leaden asides as Petrov's snooty, disapproving manager. Later on William Brisbane arrives as Linda's rich-guy suitor, adding more overbaked ham to the menu. But Astaire keeps his end up, dancing to a skipping record or later overplaying a mock Russian accent in his first face-to-face with Linda. "You don't want to dance with the great Petrov," he declares, playing up a Slavic superiority trip. "Don't be a silly horse." The way he elongates that last "o" is positively indecent. Some reviewers here say Rogers seems bored in this film. She's playing a withdrawn character, though, and does give off passion when called upon. A big musical moment between her and Astaire, when he declares "They Can't Take That Away From Me", is a remarkable duet despite the fact she doesn't sing a note, just looks off with tear-filled eyes. Yet she gets the song's one close-up, and rightly so. When they have their first performance in front of an audience and he dances up a storm by way of an introduction, the look on her face is priceless. "What am I supposed to do?" she deadpans. Give director Mark Sandrich credit for keeping things light. Too light at times, like when Linda's manager somehow gets a photo of the couple in bed together by using a manikin of her he just happens to have in his closet (better I guess we don't know why he does). Sandrich does make the good scenes better with doses of gentle humor, like the capper to a roller-skating dance that is the movie's best moment. There are some nice dissolves from scene to scene, like a flip-book view of Linda dancing that melts into the real thing. Watching this the first time, the minutes stretched like rubber. The second time things flew much faster, because I knew what I wanted to see and could look forward to its arrival. I guess audiences of the 1930s had that expectation built in, one reason perhaps why these movies were so popular and no one cared when they were a bit inane.

    The story is rather thin and silly and Ketti Gallian's performance came across as vapid; the rest however is sheer pleasure. The film is beautifully shot with extravagant, if not quite as sophisticated as Top Hat and particularly Swing Time, production values, particularly apparent in Let's Call the Whole Thing Off. George and Ira Gershwin's score and songs don't disappoint either, really quite wonderful actually. Standing out were the catchy Let's Call the Whole Thing Off and the touchingly melancholic They Can't Take That Away From Me. The choreography dazzles and shows great energy and poise, just seeing Fred and Ginger in roller skates for Let's Call the Whole Thing Off makes one envious of how they were able to do that and make it seem so easy. The dialogue has a real warmth and wit, the dialogue during the jail scene is just hilarious and that scene came across as the best from a comedic point of view, and the gags and such are good-natured and enjoyably daft. Shall We Dance is not without heart either, it is very difficult not to be moved by You Can't Take That Away From Me. Fred Astaire is immensely charming and likable and dances a dream as always, it more than makes up for that he's not all that convincing as a Russian. Ginger Rogers looks gorgeous and interacts and dances with Astaire wonderfully, you are not quite as emotionally invested in Linda Keene as you are with some of her other characters but Rogers still gives everything she's got. In supporting roles, Eric Blore was a joy and provided some of the film's funniest moments(the aforementioned jail scene), though Edward Everett Horton and Jerome Cowan are very enjoyable as well. To conclude, a great piece of escapism. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    First of all, Fred Astaire is far too American to be believable as a Russian dancer named "Petrov", and the squabbling he goes through with Ginger Rogers (as an off-key star of musical revues) is a repeat of everything that they've done in their movies up until now. But when you've got Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore and RKO's top art decco set directors, that's enough to distract you from the silliness of the plot. Add on songs by the Gershwins (the first of two films where they collaborated together) and all those reluctant complaints seem redundant. The basic plot has Astaire and Rogers being mistaken in the press as married, and before you know it, they're hotter than Brad and Angelina. Ginger wants no part of this, but Freddie has a few tricks up his sleeve to win her for good. Thanks to George and Ira's music (some of George's last), it works. Fred woos her to "They Can't Take That Away From Me" (which he would repeat 12 years later in "The Barkleys of Broadway") and even has a bunch of dancers with Ginger masks prancing around him in the title number. What tough Broadway star wouldn't fall for that? The lyrics for Ira are very clever too, particularly in "They All Laughed" and "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off". As visually exciting as the ship set song "Let Yourself Go" is, what boiler room looks like a Broadway set? Horton & Blore provide droll humor, and exchange some great lines. All they are missing is Franklin Pangborn.

    One of the things about the RKO musicals is that, though they seem dated now, at the time they were the very epitome of chic modernity. Or at least, that's what they aimed to be. Shall We Dance begins by lambasting the "stuffy" world of ballet in favour of the "fun" of jazz. The Fred and Ginger series was itself starting to run out of steam a bit by now, and it's hard not to see this as part of an increasing desperation to seem trendy and relevant. Shall We Dance is arguably the most prestigious of the Astaire-Rogers musicals, with several large-scale dance numbers and music by the brothers Gershwin, high priests of early jazz. The big dance routines are all very well, but it seems a shame the Shall We Dance relies upon them so much when the magic of these pictures was in the simple couple numbers. The Gershwin contribution is of greater significance, and there are some lovely songs included here. George Gershwin's tendency to incorporate classical music forms is actually rather appropriate for the theme of ballet dancer turning to tap. In trying to keep the formula interesting, the writers of these musicals were always trying to come up with new things for Astaire to do. His ability to dance comically had already transformed the dance musical, but now there is more focus on his comic acting. His occasional delving into the extravagant Russian stereotype seems like a spiritual ancestor of Harrison Ford's Scottish Laird routine in Last Crusade. It's not exactly the sort of thing to kick off a career as a comedian, but it is amusing through its sheer badness. Unfortunately, it looks like many of Fred's shenanigans here were at the expense of decent screen moments for Ginger. Keeping some consistency in the series are appearances by Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore, who are as wonderful as ever. Long-term Astaire-Rogers director Mark Sandrich brings his usual lyrical touch to proceedings. His flair with elaborate long takes is highlighted in the nice flowing opening scene, introducing Fred's "Petrov" alter-ego and Horton's character via paintings, in one sweeping camera move. His real forte was in beautifully discrete introductions to songs. "They Can't Take That Away from Me" is established with a long static dialogue scene, Ginger with her back to Fred. When Astaire slides into the song, the shot and angle don't change and it just seems a totally natural progression of the scene. Towards the end of it he throws in a pay-off with an emotional close-up of Rogers. Done like this, the number is worth more than all the over-sized dance-offs put together. All in all Shall We Dance is a fairly run-of-the-mill Astaire-Rogers musical. Falling short of classic status, it's really just a twee bit of 30s nostalgia Â– the music, the story, those big white sets like the interior of some art deco spaceship. It's far from bad, but the series had by now seen its best days.

It's often claimed that it Polglase's sets, all the telephones and their cords were white. It's a bloody lie. The telephones here are silver. Anyway, Gershwin did manage to avoid anything resembling classical music -- a good idea since neither dancer was trained in ballet -- except for one number featuring Harriet Hoctor, a former Ziegfield Follies entertainer. OMG, what a woman. She dances well enough, fingertips aflutter, more skillfully and more flamboyantly feminine than Ginger Rogers, but then she does this THING with her back. En point, she bends backwards into such a lengthy arc that her head almost touches the floor -- and then she repeatedly taps the top of her head with the toe of her ballet slipper. It's a shtick that belongs in an out take from "The Exorcist." There's an earlier number with Astaire and Rogers on roller skates but I could never find much grace in roller skating. It begins slowly. It's an hour almost before the two leads dance together. And the end has dozens of women dancing around wearing masks of Ginger Rogers' face. The movie didn't make as much money as earlier outings. Time for something new -- but what? The pair tried a musical biography of a pair of real dancers whose time had long passed, Vernon and Irene Castle. Maybe what they needed was a stronger and funnier plot line. Rogers never got one in a musical. Astaire had only one, "The Bandwagon" in the early 50s. I remember when Ginger Rogers passed away. She merited one or two lines in Newsweek, hardly a whisper. It was fifty years or more since her heyday and Americans have little interest in vernacular history.

    While in Paris, the famous dancer Pete "Petrov" Peters (Fred Astaire) meets the also famous tap dancer Linda Keene (Ginger Rogers) and he makes fun with her pretending that he is a Russian ballet master. He immediately falls in love with her and when he learns that she will travel to New York in an ocean liner, her arranges with his producer Jeffrey Baird (Edward Everett Horton) to travel in the same ship as Linda. In the departure, the annoying dancer and former affair of Petrov, Lady Denise Tarrington (Ketti Gallian), comes to the harbor and Petrov lies to her, telling that he has secretly married Linda, to get rid off Denise. However, Denise sends a telegram to the ship congratulating the couple and the lie turns into a gossip to the press. Now the lives of Petrov and Linda get very complicated with the situation. "Shall We Dance" is another naive film of the couple Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, with delightful confusion and musical numbers. The gags are dated but funny and the film is a pleasant entertaining for cinema and dance lovers. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Vamos Dan&ccedil;ar?" ("Shall We Dance?")

    After "The Gay Divorc&eacute;e," the first starring vehicle for Astaire and Rogers, established the formula of breezy mixture of musical numbers and comedy, the duo kept appearing in films that varied the formula only slightly, and so it goes here. This one features the music of Gershwin, including "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off," "They All Laughed," and "They Can't Take That Away from Me," and Horton and Blore once again provide the laughs. It's pleasant enough, but falls short compared to the likes of "Top Hat" and "Swing Time." While the roller skate routine is fun, this one lacks a signature number. The script is uninspired and the comedy is forced.

    The big takeaway on Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers is how well they danced together. My big takeaway from "Shall We Dance" is how well they acted. It's one thing to give a good performance in a musical like "Carousel" or "Singing In The Rain", and quite another to deliver amid the creaky jokes, plummy patter, and contrived plot twists that make up "Shall We Dance". But they do, and thanks to them, the show turns out not only okay but rather fine. Astaire is a faux-Russian ballet dancer, Petrov, who dreams of pairing up with celebrated tap dancer Linda Keene (Rogers) both on-stage and off. Linda just wants to retire, but Petrov's earnestness begins to win her over - until she is led to believe he is using her. She leaves him just as word spreads that the two are married (and really spreads, in the form of front-page news stories and radio flashes), forcing them to face a surreal prospect. "We're the only people in the world who don't think we're married!" Linda exclaims. People watching "Shall We Dance" for the first time need patience. Astaire and Rogers don't dance for an hour, their one musical moment all that time involving walking a dog around a ship in time to a musical theme (provided by one George Gershwin, who did the score with his lyricist brother Ira). Matters are too often dominated by Edward Everett Horton's over-the-top eye rolls and leaden asides as Petrov's snooty, disapproving manager. Later on William Brisbane arrives as Linda's rich-guy suitor, adding more overbaked ham to the menu. But Astaire keeps his end up, dancing to a skipping record or later overplaying a mock Russian accent in his first face-to-face with Linda. "You don't want to dance with the great Petrov," he declares, playing up a Slavic superiority trip. "Don't be a silly horse." The way he elongates that last "o" is positively indecent. Some reviewers here say Rogers seems bored in this film. She's playing a withdrawn character, though, and does give off passion when called upon. A big musical moment between her and Astaire, when he declares "They Can't Take That Away From Me", is a remarkable duet despite the fact she doesn't sing a note, just looks off with tear-filled eyes. Yet she gets the song's one close-up, and rightly so. When they have their first performance in front of an audience and he dances up a storm by way of an introduction, the look on her face is priceless. "What am I supposed to do?" she deadpans. Give director Mark Sandrich credit for keeping things light. Too light at times, like when Linda's manager somehow gets a photo of the couple in bed together by using a manikin of her he just happens to have in his closet (better I guess we don't know why he does). Sandrich does make the good scenes better with doses of gentle humor, like the capper to a roller-skating dance that is the movie's best moment. There are some nice dissolves from scene to scene, like a flip-book view of Linda dancing that melts into the real thing. Watching this the first time, the minutes stretched like rubber. The second time things flew much faster, because I knew what I wanted to see and could look forward to its arrival. I guess audiences of the 1930s had that expectation built in, one reason perhaps why these movies were so popular and no one cared when they were a bit inane.

    The story is rather thin and silly and Ketti Gallian's performance came across as vapid; the rest however is sheer pleasure. The film is beautifully shot with extravagant, if not quite as sophisticated as Top Hat and particularly Swing Time, production values, particularly apparent in Let's Call the Whole Thing Off. George and Ira Gershwin's score and songs don't disappoint either, really quite wonderful actually. Standing out were the catchy Let's Call the Whole Thing Off and the touchingly melancholic They Can't Take That Away From Me. The choreography dazzles and shows great energy and poise, just seeing Fred and Ginger in roller skates for Let's Call the Whole Thing Off makes one envious of how they were able to do that and make it seem so easy. The dialogue has a real warmth and wit, the dialogue during the jail scene is just hilarious and that scene came across as the best from a comedic point of view, and the gags and such are good-natured and enjoyably daft. Shall We Dance is not without heart either, it is very difficult not to be moved by You Can't Take That Away From Me. Fred Astaire is immensely charming and likable and dances a dream as always, it more than makes up for that he's not all that convincing as a Russian. Ginger Rogers looks gorgeous and interacts and dances with Astaire wonderfully, you are not quite as emotionally invested in Linda Keene as you are with some of her other characters but Rogers still gives everything she's got. In supporting roles, Eric Blore was a joy and provided some of the film's funniest moments(the aforementioned jail scene), though Edward Everett Horton and Jerome Cowan are very enjoyable as well. To conclude, a great piece of escapism. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    First of all, Fred Astaire is far too American to be believable as a Russian dancer named "Petrov", and the squabbling he goes through with Ginger Rogers (as an off-key star of musical revues) is a repeat of everything that they've done in their movies up until now. But when you've got Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore and RKO's top art decco set directors, that's enough to distract you from the silliness of the plot. Add on songs by the Gershwins (the first of two films where they collaborated together) and all those reluctant complaints seem redundant. The basic plot has Astaire and Rogers being mistaken in the press as married, and before you know it, they're hotter than Brad and Angelina. Ginger wants no part of this, but Freddie has a few tricks up his sleeve to win her for good. Thanks to George and Ira's music (some of George's last), it works. Fred woos her to "They Can't Take That Away From Me" (which he would repeat 12 years later in "The Barkleys of Broadway") and even has a bunch of dancers with Ginger masks prancing around him in the title number. What tough Broadway star wouldn't fall for that? The lyrics for Ira are very clever too, particularly in "They All Laughed" and "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off". As visually exciting as the ship set song "Let Yourself Go" is, what boiler room looks like a Broadway set? Horton & Blore provide droll humor, and exchange some great lines. All they are missing is Franklin Pangborn.

    One of the things about the RKO musicals is that, though they seem dated now, at the time they were the very epitome of chic modernity. Or at least, that's what they aimed to be. Shall We Dance begins by lambasting the "stuffy" world of ballet in favour of the "fun" of jazz. The Fred and Ginger series was itself starting to run out of steam a bit by now, and it's hard not to see this as part of an increasing desperation to seem trendy and relevant. Shall We Dance is arguably the most prestigious of the Astaire-Rogers musicals, with several large-scale dance numbers and music by the brothers Gershwin, high priests of early jazz. The big dance routines are all very well, but it seems a shame the Shall We Dance relies upon them so much when the magic of these pictures was in the simple couple numbers. The Gershwin contribution is of greater significance, and there are some lovely songs included here. George Gershwin's tendency to incorporate classical music forms is actually rather appropriate for the theme of ballet dancer turning to tap. In trying to keep the formula interesting, the writers of these musicals were always trying to come up with new things for Astaire to do. His ability to dance comically had already transformed the dance musical, but now there is more focus on his comic acting. His occasional delving into the extravagant Russian stereotype seems like a spiritual ancestor of Harrison Ford's Scottish Laird routine in Last Crusade. It's not exactly the sort of thing to kick off a career as a comedian, but it is amusing through its sheer badness. Unfortunately, it looks like many of Fred's shenanigans here were at the expense of decent screen moments for Ginger. Keeping some consistency in the series are appearances by Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore, who are as wonderful as ever. Long-term Astaire-Rogers director Mark Sandrich brings his usual lyrical touch to proceedings. His flair with elaborate long takes is highlighted in the nice flowing opening scene, introducing Fred's "Petrov" alter-ego and Horton's character via paintings, in one sweeping camera move. His real forte was in beautifully discrete introductions to songs. "They Can't Take That Away from Me" is established with a long static dialogue scene, Ginger with her back to Fred. When Astaire slides into the song, the shot and angle don't change and it just seems a totally natural progression of the scene. Towards the end of it he throws in a pay-off with an emotional close-up of Rogers. Done like this, the number is worth more than all the over-sized dance-offs put together. All in all Shall We Dance is a fairly run-of-the-mill Astaire-Rogers musical. Falling short of classic status, it's really just a twee bit of 30s nostalgia Â– the music, the story, those big white sets like the interior of some art deco spaceship. It's far from bad, but the series had by now seen its best days.

    In recent years, the title of this film has become overshadowed by two modern movies of the same name: a superb Japanese movie and its American remake, respectively entitled Shall We Dansu? and Shall We Dance. Yet this 1937 classic is worth revisiting not only for its famous Gershwin numbers, but as the last of a series of classic-format films between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Deeply flawed, yet the tremendous effort poured into its production is evident. And, when viewed as part of a series, touchingly beautiful. Utilising talent from their earlier films, Shall We Dance pushes the established formula of light romantic farce coupled with stunning dance routines. But here are many innovations and subtle references to delight fans. At the end of their previous film together (Swing Time), Fred serenaded Ginger with the song Never Gonna Dance, so Shall We Dance? suggests a delightful comeback through association. Their respective characters have grown through successive films, as has their on screen relationship. Now, for the first time, both play fully fledged divas in their own right. Fred is Petrov, a Russian ballet star, and Ginger is Linda, a celebrated jazz dancer. Many of the gags involve rumours about the characters being secretly married or having children. By way of a complex plot, half conducted on a transatlantic liner, the couple do actually get married for the first time in their films together. Copy picture The star personas of both Astaire and Rogers have been carefully managed by the studios since their debut together in Flying Down to Rio (1933). Fred woos her with increasing conviction or intensity in each successive movie. To suspend disbelief effectively, the audience has to be thoroughly confused for a while about the nature of their relationship (in real life, both Astaire and Rogers are married to other people at this time). The on screen characters are not married at the start of the story Â– Fred is pursuing Ginger, as usual. But an offhand comment by Petrov to an over-persistent admirer (to the effect that he and Linda are secretly married) is blown up by the newspapers in the story. The only way they can dispel rumours is to get a divorce Â– which means they first have to get married. In terms of dance routines, most things had been done already, so Shall We Dance has to come up with something new. One idea is a duet on roller skates. Depending on which account we read, it took filming up to fifty takes to complete (unusually, as Fred would mostly insist on a single one). It's filmed in Central Park, and the idea is to make it look like something people would naturally be doing. It's also the longest dance Fred and Ginger have together in the film, and is made even more enjoyable by their singing Let's Call the Whole Thing Off. Another innovation is the way the story line is tied up. (Note Â– a light spoiler follows, but I think it's worth knowing what is coming in this case, so as not to miss the full effect). Petrov, now distraught that Linda won't dance with him, has a choreographed scene where he serenades with numerous showgirls who wear Linda masks. This in itself recalls earlier scenes involving a dummy positioned next to a sleeping Petrov, to 'prove' in the tabloids that they are married; and also in a flick-book he has that creates moving images of Linda. Unbeknown to Petrov, Linda yearns for them to be together. She insists on being taken backstage. Petrov's dance involves unmasking the lookalikes only to find that none are the real Linda. When he touches the real Linda's chin, he finds it is not a mask but really her. She extends her hand and, whoever the 'real' Petrov and Linda have been (they both have several identities even within the film), the audience is satisfied that the real living couple finally have a dance of love. Almost all the emotion of the film has been saved for this moment. Shall We Dance not only reprises two established stars; it examines the real life pressures and glare of publicity facing them. They were both under pressure: during filming, Ginger Rogers received a real-life extortion notice and a death threat to her mother. The movie's final dance scene maybe hints at something that is beyond words, beyond the glare of the limelight, and something eternally personal Â– as the song implies: "They Can't Take That Away from Me." The film's weaknesses include living up to expectations when a formula has peaked. In earlier pairings, Fred's character woos Ginger through dance rather than words. Here, they enjoy some comedy together but there are maybe one too many dance solos. The plot and characterisation has weaknesses too Â– Astaire is a very accomplished dancer performing balletic moves, but he was the first to admit he is no ballet star. Dance fans may feel unconvinced (similarly, the songs have been covered by much more competent singers). One of the main dance routines sees Harriet Hoctor, not Ginger, imported to dance with Fred Â– largely on account of her ability to tap through remarkable back-bends. Shall We Dance lacks much of the natural dance chemistry between Fred and Ginger displayed in earlier films, but it is an outstanding piece of their film history that should not be missed.

    This must be judged one of the lesser examples of Fred and Ginger's work. Not that it's so poor it should be avoided. It's mostly that here they don't get together and dance often or intricately enough. The story makes little sense, but then none of their plots ever did. They're beside the point. But, anyway, this is the one in which Astaire imitates a Russian ballet dancer. George Gershwin was finally seduced into writing songs for a movie but the producers were wary. George had a tendency to write classical music, the kiss of death, even with jazz elements. He had to telegram the producers with a reassuring message that he was determined to "write hits." As it turned out, the tunes were pleasant enough, including "Slap That Bass" (in the simulacrum of a ship's engine room), and the title tune. Two of the songs became standards: "They Can't Take That Away From Me" and "Let's Call The Whole Thing Off". (You say tomayto and I say tomah-to.) In many ways, the most inventive tune has no lyrics at all. It's called "Promenade" and appears when Astaire and Rogers walk their dogs on the deck of an ocean liner. And if you've ever wondered what the design style known as Art Deco was, you should definitely check this movie out because the style is here in all its extravagance in the production design by Van Nest Polglase, who by this time was having trouble with the bottle -- the white sets and furniture, the frosted glass with etched deer, the uninterpretable curlicues, and all the rest of it. It's often claimed that it Polglase's sets, all the telephones and their cords were white. It's a bloody lie. The telephones here are silver. Anyway, Gershwin did manage to avoid anything resembling classical music -- a good idea since neither dancer was trained in ballet -- except for one number featuring Harriet Hoctor, a former Ziegfield Follies entertainer. OMG, what a woman. She dances well enough, fingertips aflutter, more skillfully and more flamboyantly feminine than Ginger Rogers, but then she does this THING with her back. En point, she bends backwards into such a lengthy arc that her head almost touches the floor -- and then she repeatedly taps the top of her head with the toe of her ballet slipper. It's a shtick that belongs in an out take from "The Exorcist." There's an earlier number with Astaire and Rogers on roller skates but I could never find much grace in roller skating.

But they do, and thanks to them, the show turns out not only okay but rather fine. Astaire is a faux-Russian ballet dancer, Petrov, who dreams of pairing up with celebrated tap dancer Linda Keene (Rogers) both on-stage and off. Linda just wants to retire, but Petrov's earnestness begins to win her over - until she is led to believe he is using her. She leaves him just as word spreads that the two are married (and really spreads, in the form of front-page news stories and radio flashes), forcing them to face a surreal prospect. "We're the only people in the world who don't think we're married!" Linda exclaims. People watching "Shall We Dance" for the first time need patience. Astaire and Rogers don't dance for an hour, their one musical moment all that time involving walking a dog around a ship in time to a musical theme (provided by one George Gershwin, who did the score with his lyricist brother Ira). Matters are too often dominated by Edward Everett Horton's over-the-top eye rolls and leaden asides as Petrov's snooty, disapproving manager. Later on William Brisbane arrives as Linda's rich-guy suitor, adding more overbaked ham to the menu. But Astaire keeps his end up, dancing to a skipping record or later overplaying a mock Russian accent in his first face-to-face with Linda. "You don't want to dance with the great Petrov," he declares, playing up a Slavic superiority trip. "Don't be a silly horse." The way he elongates that last "o" is positively indecent. Some reviewers here say Rogers seems bored in this film. She's playing a withdrawn character, though, and does give off passion when called upon. A big musical moment between her and Astaire, when he declares "They Can't Take That Away From Me", is a remarkable duet despite the fact she doesn't sing a note, just looks off with tear-filled eyes. Yet she gets the song's one close-up, and rightly so. When they have their first performance in front of an audience and he dances up a storm by way of an introduction, the look on her face is priceless. "What am I supposed to do?" she deadpans. Give director Mark Sandrich credit for keeping things light. Too light at times, like when Linda's manager somehow gets a photo of the couple in bed together by using a manikin of her he just happens to have in his closet (better I guess we don't know why he does). Sandrich does make the good scenes better with doses of gentle humor, like the capper to a roller-skating dance that is the movie's best moment. There are some nice dissolves from scene to scene, like a flip-book view of Linda dancing that melts into the real thing. Watching this the first time, the minutes stretched like rubber. The second time things flew much faster, because I knew what I wanted to see and could look forward to its arrival. I guess audiences of the 1930s had that expectation built in, one reason perhaps why these movies were so popular and no one cared when they were a bit inane.

    The story is rather thin and silly and Ketti Gallian's performance came across as vapid; the rest however is sheer pleasure. The film is beautifully shot with extravagant, if not quite as sophisticated as Top Hat and particularly Swing Time, production values, particularly apparent in Let's Call the Whole Thing Off. George and Ira Gershwin's score and songs don't disappoint either, really quite wonderful actually. Standing out were the catchy Let's Call the Whole Thing Off and the touchingly melancholic They Can't Take That Away From Me. The choreography dazzles and shows great energy and poise, just seeing Fred and Ginger in roller skates for Let's Call the Whole Thing Off makes one envious of how they were able to do that and make it seem so easy. The dialogue has a real warmth and wit, the dialogue during the jail scene is just hilarious and that scene came across as the best from a comedic point of view, and the gags and such are good-natured and enjoyably daft. Shall We Dance is not without heart either, it is very difficult not to be moved by You Can't Take That Away From Me. Fred Astaire is immensely charming and likable and dances a dream as always, it more than makes up for that he's not all that convincing as a Russian. Ginger Rogers looks gorgeous and interacts and dances with Astaire wonderfully, you are not quite as emotionally invested in Linda Keene as you are with some of her other characters but Rogers still gives everything she's got. In supporting roles, Eric Blore was a joy and provided some of the film's funniest moments(the aforementioned jail scene), though Edward Everett Horton and Jerome Cowan are very enjoyable as well. To conclude, a great piece of escapism. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    First of all, Fred Astaire is far too American to be believable as a Russian dancer named "Petrov", and the squabbling he goes through with Ginger Rogers (as an off-key star of musical revues) is a repeat of everything that they've done in their movies up until now. But when you've got Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore and RKO's top art decco set directors, that's enough to distract you from the silliness of the plot. Add on songs by the Gershwins (the first of two films where they collaborated together) and all those reluctant complaints seem redundant. The basic plot has Astaire and Rogers being mistaken in the press as married, and before you know it, they're hotter than Brad and Angelina. Ginger wants no part of this, but Freddie has a few tricks up his sleeve to win her for good. Thanks to George and Ira's music (some of George's last), it works. Fred woos her to "They Can't Take That Away From Me" (which he would repeat 12 years later in "The Barkleys of Broadway") and even has a bunch of dancers with Ginger masks prancing around him in the title number. What tough Broadway star wouldn't fall for that? The lyrics for Ira are very clever too, particularly in "They All Laughed" and "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off". As visually exciting as the ship set song "Let Yourself Go" is, what boiler room looks like a Broadway set? Horton & Blore provide droll humor, and exchange some great lines. All they are missing is Franklin Pangborn.

    One of the things about the RKO musicals is that, though they seem dated now, at the time they were the very epitome of chic modernity. Or at least, that's what they aimed to be. Shall We Dance begins by lambasting the "stuffy" world of ballet in favour of the "fun" of jazz. The Fred and Ginger series was itself starting to run out of steam a bit by now, and it's hard not to see this as part of an increasing desperation to seem trendy and relevant. Shall We Dance is arguably the most prestigious of the Astaire-Rogers musicals, with several large-scale dance numbers and music by the brothers Gershwin, high priests of early jazz. The big dance routines are all very well, but it seems a shame the Shall We Dance relies upon them so much when the magic of these pictures was in the simple couple numbers. The Gershwin contribution is of greater significance, and there are some lovely songs included here. George Gershwin's tendency to incorporate classical music forms is actually rather appropriate for the theme of ballet dancer turning to tap. In trying to keep the formula interesting, the writers of these musicals were always trying to come up with new things for Astaire to do. His ability to dance comically had already transformed the dance musical, but now there is more focus on his comic acting. His occasional delving into the extravagant Russian stereotype seems like a spiritual ancestor of Harrison Ford's Scottish Laird routine in Last Crusade. It's not exactly the sort of thing to kick off a career as a comedian, but it is amusing through its sheer badness. Unfortunately, it looks like many of Fred's shenanigans here were at the expense of decent screen moments for Ginger. Keeping some consistency in the series are appearances by Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore, who are as wonderful as ever. Long-term Astaire-Rogers director Mark Sandrich brings his usual lyrical touch to proceedings. His flair with elaborate long takes is highlighted in the nice flowing opening scene, introducing Fred's "Petrov" alter-ego and Horton's character via paintings, in one sweeping camera move. His real forte was in beautifully discrete introductions to songs. "They Can't Take That Away from Me" is established with a long static dialogue scene, Ginger with her back to Fred. When Astaire slides into the song, the shot and angle don't change and it just seems a totally natural progression of the scene. Towards the end of it he throws in a pay-off with an emotional close-up of Rogers. Done like this, the number is worth more than all the over-sized dance-offs put together. All in all Shall We Dance is a fairly run-of-the-mill Astaire-Rogers musical. Falling short of classic status, it's really just a twee bit of 30s nostalgia Â– the music, the story, those big white sets like the interior of some art deco spaceship. It's far from bad, but the series had by now seen its best days.

    In recent years, the title of this film has become overshadowed by two modern movies of the same name: a superb Japanese movie and its American remake, respectively entitled Shall We Dansu? and Shall We Dance. Yet this 1937 classic is worth revisiting not only for its famous Gershwin numbers, but as the last of a series of classic-format films between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Deeply flawed, yet the tremendous effort poured into its production is evident. And, when viewed as part of a series, touchingly beautiful. Utilising talent from their earlier films, Shall We Dance pushes the established formula of light romantic farce coupled with stunning dance routines. But here are many innovations and subtle references to delight fans. At the end of their previous film together (Swing Time), Fred serenaded Ginger with the song Never Gonna Dance, so Shall We Dance? suggests a delightful comeback through association. Their respective characters have grown through successive films, as has their on screen relationship. Now, for the first time, both play fully fledged divas in their own right. Fred is Petrov, a Russian ballet star, and Ginger is Linda, a celebrated jazz dancer. Many of the gags involve rumours about the characters being secretly married or having children. By way of a complex plot, half conducted on a transatlantic liner, the couple do actually get married for the first time in their films together. Copy picture The star personas of both Astaire and Rogers have been carefully managed by the studios since their debut together in Flying Down to Rio (1933). Fred woos her with increasing conviction or intensity in each successive movie. To suspend disbelief effectively, the audience has to be thoroughly confused for a while about the nature of their relationship (in real life, both Astaire and Rogers are married to other people at this time). The on screen characters are not married at the start of the story Â– Fred is pursuing Ginger, as usual. But an offhand comment by Petrov to an over-persistent admirer (to the effect that he and Linda are secretly married) is blown up by the newspapers in the story. The only way they can dispel rumours is to get a divorce Â– which means they first have to get married. In terms of dance routines, most things had been done already, so Shall We Dance has to come up with something new. One idea is a duet on roller skates. Depending on which account we read, it took filming up to fifty takes to complete (unusually, as Fred would mostly insist on a single one). It's filmed in Central Park, and the idea is to make it look like something people would naturally be doing. It's also the longest dance Fred and Ginger have together in the film, and is made even more enjoyable by their singing Let's Call the Whole Thing Off. Another innovation is the way the story line is tied up. (Note Â– a light spoiler follows, but I think it's worth knowing what is coming in this case, so as not to miss the full effect). Petrov, now distraught that Linda won't dance with him, has a choreographed scene where he serenades with numerous showgirls who wear Linda masks. This in itself recalls earlier scenes involving a dummy positioned next to a sleeping Petrov, to 'prove' in the tabloids that they are married; and also in a flick-book he has that creates moving images of Linda. Unbeknown to Petrov, Linda yearns for them to be together. She insists on being taken backstage. Petrov's dance involves unmasking the lookalikes only to find that none are the real Linda. When he touches the real Linda's chin, he finds it is not a mask but really her. She extends her hand and, whoever the 'real' Petrov and Linda have been (they both have several identities even within the film), the audience is satisfied that the real living couple finally have a dance of love. Almost all the emotion of the film has been saved for this moment. Shall We Dance not only reprises two established stars; it examines the real life pressures and glare of publicity facing them. They were both under pressure: during filming, Ginger Rogers received a real-life extortion notice and a death threat to her mother. The movie's final dance scene maybe hints at something that is beyond words, beyond the glare of the limelight, and something eternally personal Â– as the song implies: "They Can't Take That Away from Me." The film's weaknesses include living up to expectations when a formula has peaked. In earlier pairings, Fred's character woos Ginger through dance rather than words. Here, they enjoy some comedy together but there are maybe one too many dance solos. The plot and characterisation has weaknesses too Â– Astaire is a very accomplished dancer performing balletic moves, but he was the first to admit he is no ballet star. Dance fans may feel unconvinced (similarly, the songs have been covered by much more competent singers). One of the main dance routines sees Harriet Hoctor, not Ginger, imported to dance with Fred Â– largely on account of her ability to tap through remarkable back-bends. Shall We Dance lacks much of the natural dance chemistry between Fred and Ginger displayed in earlier films, but it is an outstanding piece of their film history that should not be missed.

    This must be judged one of the lesser examples of Fred and Ginger's work. Not that it's so poor it should be avoided. It's mostly that here they don't get together and dance often or intricately enough. The story makes little sense, but then none of their plots ever did. They're beside the point. But, anyway, this is the one in which Astaire imitates a Russian ballet dancer. George Gershwin was finally seduced into writing songs for a movie but the producers were wary. George had a tendency to write classical music, the kiss of death, even with jazz elements. He had to telegram the producers with a reassuring message that he was determined to "write hits." As it turned out, the tunes were pleasant enough, including "Slap That Bass" (in the simulacrum of a ship's engine room), and the title tune. Two of the songs became standards: "They Can't Take That Away From Me" and "Let's Call The Whole Thing Off". (You say tomayto and I say tomah-to.) In many ways, the most inventive tune has no lyrics at all. It's called "Promenade" and appears when Astaire and Rogers walk their dogs on the deck of an ocean liner. And if you've ever wondered what the design style known as Art Deco was, you should definitely check this movie out because the style is here in all its extravagance in the production design by Van Nest Polglase, who by this time was having trouble with the bottle -- the white sets and furniture, the frosted glass with etched deer, the uninterpretable curlicues, and all the rest of it. It's often claimed that it Polglase's sets, all the telephones and their cords were white. It's a bloody lie. The telephones here are silver. Anyway, Gershwin did manage to avoid anything resembling classical music -- a good idea since neither dancer was trained in ballet -- except for one number featuring Harriet Hoctor, a former Ziegfield Follies entertainer. OMG, what a woman. She dances well enough, fingertips aflutter, more skillfully and more flamboyantly feminine than Ginger Rogers, but then she does this THING with her back. En point, she bends backwards into such a lengthy arc that her head almost touches the floor -- and then she repeatedly taps the top of her head with the toe of her ballet slipper. It's a shtick that belongs in an out take from "The Exorcist." There's an earlier number with Astaire and Rogers on roller skates but I could never find much grace in roller skating. It begins slowly. It's an hour almost before the two leads dance together. And the end has dozens of women dancing around wearing masks of Ginger Rogers' face. The movie didn't make as much money as earlier outings. Time for something new -- but what? The pair tried a musical biography of a pair of real dancers whose time had long passed, Vernon and Irene Castle. Maybe what they needed was a stronger and funnier plot line. Rogers never got one in a musical. Astaire had only one, "The Bandwagon" in the early 50s. I remember when Ginger Rogers passed away. She merited one or two lines in Newsweek, hardly a whisper. It was fifty years or more since her heyday and Americans have little interest in vernacular history.

    While in Paris, the famous dancer Pete "Petrov" Peters (Fred Astaire) meets the also famous tap dancer Linda Keene (Ginger Rogers) and he makes fun with her pretending that he is a Russian ballet master. He immediately falls in love with her and when he learns that she will travel to New York in an ocean liner, her arranges with his producer Jeffrey Baird (Edward Everett Horton) to travel in the same ship as Linda. In the departure, the annoying dancer and former affair of Petrov, Lady Denise Tarrington (Ketti Gallian), comes to the harbor and Petrov lies to her, telling that he has secretly married Linda, to get rid off Denise. However, Denise sends a telegram to the ship congratulating the couple and the lie turns into a gossip to the press. Now the lives of Petrov and Linda get very complicated with the situation. "Shall We Dance" is another naive film of the couple Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, with delightful confusion and musical numbers. The gags are dated but funny and the film is a pleasant entertaining for cinema and dance lovers. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Vamos Dan&ccedil;ar?" ("Shall We Dance?")

    Peter P Peters is an American ballet dancer who's known as Petrov.He wants to blend classical ballet with modern jazz, and then when he sees the picture of tap dancer Linda Keene, he immediately falls in love with her.Before they know it, they're married.Or at least the press thinks so.Shall We Dance from 1937 is directed by Mark Sandrich.Its producer is Pandro S. Berman.Behind the music are the brothers George and Ira Gershwin.This is the seventh of the ten Astaire-Rogers movies.The chemistry between the leading couple works, as always.Edward Everett Horton plays Jeffrey Baird.Eric Blore is Cecil Flintridge.James Cowan plays Arthur Miller.Ketti Gallian is Lady Denise Tarrington.The movie has some great comedy and musical bits.It's quite amusing when Fred pretends to be the Russian guy to Ginger, doing the accent and all.It's amazing to watch Fred doing the tap dance routine in a ship's engine room to the song "Slap That Bass".The song "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off" works and doing the tap dance on an ice-rink wearing roller blades.In one memorable scene Fred dances with many Gingers, only one being real.This movie is very entertaining, like any Fred and Ginger movie is.

    After "The Gay Divorc&eacute;e," the first starring vehicle for Astaire and Rogers, established the formula of breezy mixture of musical numbers and comedy, the duo kept appearing in films that varied the formula only slightly, and so it goes here. This one features the music of Gershwin, including "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off," "They All Laughed," and "They Can't Take That Away from Me," and Horton and Blore once again provide the laughs. It's pleasant enough, but falls short compared to the likes of "Top Hat" and "Swing Time." While the roller skate routine is fun, this one lacks a signature number. The script is uninspired and the comedy is forced.

    Ballet master on an ocean liner from Paris to New York City inadvertently starts a rumor that he is a newly-married man; the manager of a hot-tempered American dancer also on-board exploits his client as the would-be betrothed strictly for the publicity. Lackluster Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical-comedy has about enough plot for a short subject. The singing and dancing are wonderful (including a famous sequence on roller skates); however, with so little connection between the two stars, the romantic angle of the picture never quite comes to life. Rogers is in a perpetual foul mood throughout--and when Astaire dances solo, playing right to the camera, it smacks of ostentation. The George and Ira Gershwin songs (including the Oscar-nominated "They Can't Take That Away From Me") are a nice compensation for the lack of sparks. The RKO sets gleam with artificiality, while Edward Everett Horton and funny Eric Blore supply the wacky comedic asides. ** from ****
