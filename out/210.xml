  When Dr. Henry Jones Sr. suddenly goes missing while pursuing the Holy Grail, eminent archaeologist Indiana Jones must follow in his father's footsteps and stop the Nazis.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Indiana Jones, famed adventurer and archaeologist acquires a diary that holds clues and a map with no names to find the mysterious Holy Grail- which was sent from his father, Dr. Henry Jones, in Italy. Upon hearing from a private collector, Walter Donavan, that the mission for the Holy Grail went astray with the disappearance of his father, Indiana Jones and museum curator Marcus Brody venture to Italy in search of Indy's father. However, upon retrieving Dr. Henry Jones in Nazi territory, the rescue mission turns into a race to find the Holy Grail before the Nazis do- who plan to use it for complete world domination for their super-race. With the diary as a vital key and the map with no names as a guide, Indiana Jones once again finds himself in another death defying adventure of pure excitement.

    After two masterpieces (one very underrated), the dual Spielberg and George Lucas had achieved complete success, and didn't plan to stop there. Spielberg promised Lucas since the beginning that if would make one he would have to make a trilogy. And they didn't disappointed closing their trilogy with a golden key with another underrated masterpiece that captured millions of fans and made Dr. Indiana Jones legendary forever. Our great adventure this time begins when our unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in another of his adventures in the middle of the Pacific ocean being beat-up by pirates. When Dr. Jones takes control of the situation and steal a strange diary from the leader, manages to escape with a job well done (the first in the trilogy). Days later, we see our hero back to his college teaching job educating young mind. After the class, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) chief and friend of Jones comes and warns him that Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), a relics collector want to offer him a new job. Shortly after the conversation with Walter, Jones discovers that the work involves the diary that he recovered from the pirates, showing the path to find the "Holy Grail" (for those who do not know, the cup that Christ drank at the Last Supper). And Jones also finds out that this job had already been offered to his father Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), who disappeared in a museum in Venice. Now Jones embarks on a mission to find his father with Marcus and the path to the Holy Grail, which will take them from a museum in Venice to the Arabic deserts with danger following them closely. I think Lucas and Spielberg in this film have decided to put all that was good in the first and second film and joined perfectly (which the last movie of a trilogy usually does). Proof of this is the return of Marcus making him a very important character in the adventure, and later the return of Sallah (John Rhys - Davies) who doesn't have much relevance, but it is fun to see him again since the first film. But the main thing that Lucas and Spielberg gave the story was to humanize the character of Indiana Jones. They do this through the first sequence of the film where we see a younger Indiana Jones, where we discovered many secrets of his past and finally the origin of the cowboy hat and the whip, even his name (and finally the reference to the Western genre in a film Spielberg). And when his father Henry Jones appears, and perhaps the best thing of the film. Since the first meeting in the movie of the Joneses, we already see the type of relationship between them two. Henry is a born lover of artifacts and history, giving more attention to study than the son who has created some resentment to his father. But their relationship throughout the film not only evolves, but thanks to the actors, they have an exceptional chemistry, making us laugh and love them even more. All this also thanks to the screenwriter Jeffrey Boam. Since the first film Lucas and Spielberg always changed the writers. Lawrence Kasdan in the first (considered one of the best screenplays ever written) and the couple Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz in the second (underrated). But Jeffrey didn't disappoint, making almost equal to Lawrence in the first, giving moments of dialog in the film, none of them gets to be boring, always flowing along very well in the story, especially between the Jones duo. Also filling the movie with a laughing out loud humor (perhaps the most humorous of the trilogy) but never gets to be stupid, but works very well in all the situations and the relationship of father and son. Mention direction and performances this time is stupid. Since the 1st movie Spielberg never disappoint in their direction, and wouldn't be different this time giving spectacular (and hilarious) action scenes from start to finish. And Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones never disappointed, and would not be this time (perhaps his best performance as the unforgettable and badass teacher). This also involves Sean Cornery giving an unforgettable character with a superb performance, and he and Harrison giving an incredible chemistry in their characters. Maybe not the best of the trilogy, but it's a fans favorite, and not for nothing. From a superb script that gives humor and soul to their characters, a marvelous direction, excellent performances, the best chemistry ever put between two characters in a movie. Spielberg and Lucas finished their trilogy giving heart and soul to Indiana Jones, reminding us why we love him, and making this saga forever legendary! 10/10

There was a clip art animation added some coloring effects with some graphic tools.The movie was so fun though some scenes are predictable.considering as a 1989 movie, director done it more than it deserve i thought.

    Third Indiana Jones film is a big improvement over the heavy handed 'Temple Of Doom', telling a more straight-forward story involving Indiana(Harrison Ford of course) going in search of both his missing father(Sean Connery, very well cast) and the Holy Grail, which entangles him once again with Nazis[1938 setting] and a brief meeting with Adolf Hitler... Steven Spielberg directs this globe-trotting adventure without missing a beat, and has the welcome return of Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies to the cast. Fine British actor Julian Glover plays the villain, and beautiful Allison Doody his conflicted love interest. Film is great fun all around, right until the rousing ending. Some story elements may not be new, but are still put across in a most entertaining package.

    Basically this is a remake of "Raiders Of The Lost Ark": Indiana Jones must beat the Nazis to obtaining the holy relic. The main differences are a lack of strong villains, and the inclusion of Indy's father in the story. Unfortunately Sean Connery and Harrison Ford are not convincing as father and son. The original film was an exciting roller-coaster ride, a remake of 1930's- style exotic adventures. This is the same without the excitement, or any good characters. Even the sword fight which takes place here to make up for the lack of one in the original (because rumor has it that Harrison Ford was too ill at the time to perform it) is tired and unexciting, as is the rest of the movie. The only good thing I can say about it is that it was better than the hideous "Temple Of Doom"-but that is a weak compliment indeed.

    Back as an adult, Indy's father is kidnapped and he must set out to find him. His only clues are his father's diary notes, which were mysteriously sent to him earlier that day. They lead him to Italy, where he meets the gorgeous blonde, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), who becomes an integral part of this story. Raiders of the Lost Ark was one hell of a ride, The Temple of Doom was too dark, too gruesome for some. The Last Crusade took the best elements of the first film. The Nazis, the search for a mystical religious artifact, Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies. The film starts with a sequence with Indy as a kid, obviously this was a appetiser for Lucas's idea of the Young Indiana Jones adventures. The problem is what was a very well utilised idea here led to a lame TV series. The addition of Sean Connery as Indy's father leads to some of the best comic films in the moment, with also some literate moments, plenty of action and very nifty special effects. Its a Saturday afternoon in the movies spectacular.

    Grade: A Well two are better then one as Harrison Ford has done a fine job with the films before, but when his father played by Sean Connery joins the fun, it's even better and that's what puts this film just above the first. The beginning is a flashback from Indy's childhood, before it carries over to the present, but one thing to look at is that his father ignores him when he finds something interesting because he is working on his own adventure. Then Indy is asked to help a friend named Donovan to look for the Holy Grail, but Indy says no and says that he should ask his father, but then learns that his father is already on it, but has gone missing. He goes looking for clues to the grail as well as to his father, and then goes to a building where his father is, but when they escape, Indy is fooled as the woman he thought loved him and was with him was actually the enemy with who else but Donovan, the man who hired him. They did something new, make the woman the bad guy. Now Indy and his father have to escape the burning building. They escape the Nazi's from the building and now they must go after Donovan because he took the book from Indy's father but the map's not in there. Instead, it's with Marcus and they capture Marcus and the map to the Holy Grail. This is now a great adventure because the scenes in finding the map are well done and the chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford is excellent. The two work very well together to keep us interested and make two scenes better, when they thought Indy died and the climax to the Holy Grail. Indy refused to help Donovan get to the grail, but he shoots his father and the grail is the only thing to keep him alive. Now when choosing the grail with the knight, and when Donovan dies, it is kind of disturbing as he ages very rapidly and layers of his skin start to disappear. Now the ending is typical, Indy chooses the right grail, saves his father, and they walk away in the sunset, literally with his father all alive and well, all the bad guys dead, and setting up the ending to one of the best trilogies ever. This film is an excellent sequel and my favorite and is one of the best conclusions to a trilogy when comparing it to its predecessors.

    Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the third of the highly popular Indiana Jones series and with fans generally divided on Temple of Doom and almost universally loathing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Last Crusade is often considered the best of the sequels though few consider it on par with Raiders of the Lost Ark. Last Crusade feels the most personal out of the films and represents Spielberg at his most emotional. Crusade lacks some of the originality that made Raiders such a gripping film as well as the darkness and relentlessness of Temple but it succeeds by itself as a fun and compelling adventure movie. The film opens in 1912 in Utah with young Indiana Jones as a teenage boy scout trying to retrieve an artifact known as the Cross of Coronado from a group of diggers. He fails in getting it but 26 years later, he finally succeeds in retrieving the Cross and donates it to his friend and colleague Marcus Brody's museum. He then meets Walter Donovan, an archaeologist and businessman. Donovan informs Indy that his father Henry Jones has gone missing whilst searching for the Holy Grail, the cup of life that Jesus Christ himself possessed, using an incomplete inscription. Indy is then sent his father's grail diary and decides to travel to Venice, where Henry was last located before he disappeared, with Marcus. They meet Henry's Austrian colleague Elsa Schneider who shows them to the library where Henry was before he went missing. In some catacombs underneath the library, they discover the tomb of a Knight of the First Crusade which contains the complete inscription of the guide to discovering the Grail's location. After being chased by a secret order devoted to protecting the Grail from evil intentions, Indy learns from a trustworthy member that his father is being held in a castle on the Austrian-German border. He succeeds in rescuing his father but Elsa and Donovan are revealed as being Nazi collaborators, with Donovan desiring the Grail for immortality. Spielberg stated that Last Crusade is about family and the relationship between Indiana and his father perfectly represents that. The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery is pitch perfect and one of the movie's great strengths. These two have a tense but also a clear love for one another, going on an adventure that can have an effect on the both of them in their lives. Much of the comedy in this movie also comes from the character of Henry. Connery gives a terrific performance, touching on the paternal aspect of the character whilst also making him a serious man who is also bumbling at times. Ford is also still effective as Indy, and even shows a more emotional side to the character than he did previously. Denholm Elliott is back as Marcus in a much larger role and the comedy in his character is played up more. John-Rhys Davies also returns as Sallah, also providing a relaxing touch to the film. Alison Doody is a different love interest than Temple of Doom's Willie. She's not a damsel in distress and but is also more vulnerable than Marion despite being a villain. Julian Glover's Donovan is a similar villain to the conniving Belloq from Raiders, except more of a megalomaniac. River Phoenix's cameo as the young Indy is also strong and an impressionable younger version of Harrison Ford. The various supernatural themes in this movie are explored in great detail here as they were in the past films. The quest for the Holy Grail is about gaining immortality and the path of the righteous. Gaining this is risky and could cost the life of the pursuer. Indy and Donovan are both looking for the Grail for different reasons. Donovan is interested in the Grail for his own personal gain and his wish for immortality. Indy desires it because out of love for his father and as a way to satisfy a relationship. As I've said, the key theme of this movie is family which is explored through the father and son journeying to achieve a life-time goal out of craving an adventure. Whenever one of them is seemingly about to die or is dead, we feel their pain. The action in this movie is also much more rousing than in the previous two, including a plane battle, a confrontation on a tank and evading the booby traps in the temple of the Grail. The visuals and lighting in this film are less extravagant in this movie than in the previous two. This is a relatively colourless movie. The Last Crusade is a successful motion picture with a lot of heart and energy even if it fails to meet the cinematic heights of the first film or even the second in terms of creativity. The character relationships, the supernatural ideas and the story are all strong elements and had Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had not been released, this would've been a terrific way to close off the series. Despite the highly positive reviews and financial success this movie garnered, there wouldn't be an Indiana Jones sequel for over a decade. More on that later.

    Simply the best part of Indiana Jones trilogy. Great script, great special effects (for those times), great atmosphere. Funny sense of humor and of course some romantics. Good rehabilitation from previous awful Temple of Doom. Last Crusade is a template for all adventure movies. This is supposed to be the final movie of Indiana's adventures. What can i say more? Awesome adventure movie of all times - without any compromises. This is an excellent film and many people still watch it to this day. PS there is a sequel, next part ...can't imagine what is about, but i have a feeling of a complete failure...

    Amongst all the IMDb reviews for Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade, one reviewer called it, "the most fun I ever had watching a movie". I, for one, cannot disagree with that assessment. The film is chock full of entertaining set-pieces, humour & the decision made to cast Sean Connery as Indiana Jones father Professor Henry Jones just worked wonderfully well. Alison Doody, in my opinion, was the best of the trilogies leading ladies. (Yes, i know there was a fourth but i am disregarding the later "Crystal Skull" which was a mistake). John Rhys-Davies was great & Denholm Elliott always seemed to enhance any movie he was ever in. Take "Trading Places", for instance. Most of the jokes used in the film are hilarious like when the "Jones boys" are forced to travel to Berlin during a book-burning nazi rally. After dressing up as a nazi officer & recovering his fathers diary, Indiana Jones inadvertently bumps into Adolf Hitler. Hitler naturally thinks he wants him to autograph his book & signs it. Not long after they board an airship to get them out of "the lions den". As the airship is awaiting take-off the SS officer Colonel Vogel comes on board looking for Indy & his dad. Indy sees him coming & dresses up as a ticket inspector. Colonel Vogel first finds his father Professor Jones trying to hide his face behind his newspaper. Indy challenges the SS officer to see his ticket, punches him, throws him out of a window & declares to the astonished passengers "No ticket". The passengers, not wishing anything similar happening to them, frantically all hold up their tickets. Two great gags amongst plenty more!. If anyone put me on the spot & asked what is your all-time favourite movie, I would say this one.

    I'd say this is tied with the original "Raiders of the Lost Ark." The dialogue and action mixes really well from beginning to end between both Indiana and his father. The holy grail was a very interesting artifact and made for a very interesting story. The entire movie includes some very famous scenes, including the boat scene, the library scene, and the second half of the movie is spot-on terrific. This is a great action movie and shows the power and desperate desire for immortality. This movie ended on a high note, and it should have ended that way. My advice is you shouldn't watch the fourth movie, though. This is a better ending then it could ever be. Plus, the soundtrack is amazing. Great to watch for fathers day, that's my plan

    After two masterpieces (one very underrated), the dual Spielberg and George Lucas had achieved complete success, and didn't plan to stop there. Spielberg promised Lucas since the beginning that if would make one he would have to make a trilogy. And they didn't disappointed closing their trilogy with a golden key with another underrated masterpiece that captured millions of fans and made Dr. Indiana Jones legendary forever. Our great adventure this time begins when our unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in another of his adventures in the middle of the Pacific ocean being beat-up by pirates. When Dr. Jones takes control of the situation and steal a strange diary from the leader, manages to escape with a job well done (the first in the trilogy). Days later, we see our hero back to his college teaching job educating young mind. After the class, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) chief and friend of Jones comes and warns him that Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), a relics collector want to offer him a new job. Shortly after the conversation with Walter, Jones discovers that the work involves the diary that he recovered from the pirates, showing the path to find the "Holy Grail" (for those who do not know, the cup that Christ drank at the Last Supper). And Jones also finds out that this job had already been offered to his father Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), who disappeared in a museum in Venice. Now Jones embarks on a mission to find his father with Marcus and the path to the Holy Grail, which will take them from a museum in Venice to the Arabic deserts with danger following them closely. I think Lucas and Spielberg in this film have decided to put all that was good in the first and second film and joined perfectly (which the last movie of a trilogy usually does). Proof of this is the return of Marcus making him a very important character in the adventure, and later the return of Sallah (John Rhys - Davies) who doesn't have much relevance, but it is fun to see him again since the first film. But the main thing that Lucas and Spielberg gave the story was to humanize the character of Indiana Jones. They do this through the first sequence of the film where we see a younger Indiana Jones, where we discovered many secrets of his past and finally the origin of the cowboy hat and the whip, even his name (and finally the reference to the Western genre in a film Spielberg). And when his father Henry Jones appears, and perhaps the best thing of the film. Since the first meeting in the movie of the Joneses, we already see the type of relationship between them two. Henry is a born lover of artifacts and history, giving more attention to study than the son who has created some resentment to his father. But their relationship throughout the film not only evolves, but thanks to the actors, they have an exceptional chemistry, making us laugh and love them even more. All this also thanks to the screenwriter Jeffrey Boam. Since the first film Lucas and Spielberg always changed the writers.

But Jeffrey didn't disappoint, making almost equal to Lawrence in the first, giving moments of dialog in the film, none of them gets to be boring, always flowing along very well in the story, especially between the Jones duo. Also filling the movie with a laughing out loud humor (perhaps the most humorous of the trilogy) but never gets to be stupid, but works very well in all the situations and the relationship of father and son. Mention direction and performances this time is stupid. Since the 1st movie Spielberg never disappoint in their direction, and wouldn't be different this time giving spectacular (and hilarious) action scenes from start to finish. And Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones never disappointed, and would not be this time (perhaps his best performance as the unforgettable and badass teacher). This also involves Sean Cornery giving an unforgettable character with a superb performance, and he and Harrison giving an incredible chemistry in their characters. Maybe not the best of the trilogy, but it's a fans favorite, and not for nothing. From a superb script that gives humor and soul to their characters, a marvelous direction, excellent performances, the best chemistry ever put between two characters in a movie. Spielberg and Lucas finished their trilogy giving heart and soul to Indiana Jones, reminding us why we love him, and making this saga forever legendary! 10/10

He goes looking for clues to the grail as well as to his father, and then goes to a building where his father is, but when they escape, Indy is fooled as the woman he thought loved him and was with him was actually the enemy with who else but Donovan, the man who hired him. They did something new, make the woman the bad guy. Now Indy and his father have to escape the burning building. They escape the Nazi's from the building and now they must go after Donovan because he took the book from Indy's father but the map's not in there. Instead, it's with Marcus and they capture Marcus and the map to the Holy Grail. This is now a great adventure because the scenes in finding the map are well done and the chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford is excellent. The two work very well together to keep us interested and make two scenes better, when they thought Indy died and the climax to the Holy Grail. Indy refused to help Donovan get to the grail, but he shoots his father and the grail is the only thing to keep him alive. Now when choosing the grail with the knight, and when Donovan dies, it is kind of disturbing as he ages very rapidly and layers of his skin start to disappear. Now the ending is typical, Indy chooses the right grail, saves his father, and they walk away in the sunset, literally with his father all alive and well, all the bad guys dead, and setting up the ending to one of the best trilogies ever. This film is an excellent sequel and my favorite and is one of the best conclusions to a trilogy when comparing it to its predecessors.

    Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the third of the highly popular Indiana Jones series and with fans generally divided on Temple of Doom and almost universally loathing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Last Crusade is often considered the best of the sequels though few consider it on par with Raiders of the Lost Ark. Last Crusade feels the most personal out of the films and represents Spielberg at his most emotional. Crusade lacks some of the originality that made Raiders such a gripping film as well as the darkness and relentlessness of Temple but it succeeds by itself as a fun and compelling adventure movie. The film opens in 1912 in Utah with young Indiana Jones as a teenage boy scout trying to retrieve an artifact known as the Cross of Coronado from a group of diggers. He fails in getting it but 26 years later, he finally succeeds in retrieving the Cross and donates it to his friend and colleague Marcus Brody's museum. He then meets Walter Donovan, an archaeologist and businessman. Donovan informs Indy that his father Henry Jones has gone missing whilst searching for the Holy Grail, the cup of life that Jesus Christ himself possessed, using an incomplete inscription. Indy is then sent his father's grail diary and decides to travel to Venice, where Henry was last located before he disappeared, with Marcus. They meet Henry's Austrian colleague Elsa Schneider who shows them to the library where Henry was before he went missing. In some catacombs underneath the library, they discover the tomb of a Knight of the First Crusade which contains the complete inscription of the guide to discovering the Grail's location. After being chased by a secret order devoted to protecting the Grail from evil intentions, Indy learns from a trustworthy member that his father is being held in a castle on the Austrian-German border. He succeeds in rescuing his father but Elsa and Donovan are revealed as being Nazi collaborators, with Donovan desiring the Grail for immortality. Spielberg stated that Last Crusade is about family and the relationship between Indiana and his father perfectly represents that. The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery is pitch perfect and one of the movie's great strengths. These two have a tense but also a clear love for one another, going on an adventure that can have an effect on the both of them in their lives. Much of the comedy in this movie also comes from the character of Henry. Connery gives a terrific performance, touching on the paternal aspect of the character whilst also making him a serious man who is also bumbling at times. Ford is also still effective as Indy, and even shows a more emotional side to the character than he did previously. Denholm Elliott is back as Marcus in a much larger role and the comedy in his character is played up more. John-Rhys Davies also returns as Sallah, also providing a relaxing touch to the film. Alison Doody is a different love interest than Temple of Doom's Willie. She's not a damsel in distress and but is also more vulnerable than Marion despite being a villain. Julian Glover's Donovan is a similar villain to the conniving Belloq from Raiders, except more of a megalomaniac. River Phoenix's cameo as the young Indy is also strong and an impressionable younger version of Harrison Ford. The various supernatural themes in this movie are explored in great detail here as they were in the past films. The quest for the Holy Grail is about gaining immortality and the path of the righteous. Gaining this is risky and could cost the life of the pursuer. Indy and Donovan are both looking for the Grail for different reasons. Donovan is interested in the Grail for his own personal gain and his wish for immortality. Indy desires it because out of love for his father and as a way to satisfy a relationship. As I've said, the key theme of this movie is family which is explored through the father and son journeying to achieve a life-time goal out of craving an adventure. Whenever one of them is seemingly about to die or is dead, we feel their pain. The action in this movie is also much more rousing than in the previous two, including a plane battle, a confrontation on a tank and evading the booby traps in the temple of the Grail. The visuals and lighting in this film are less extravagant in this movie than in the previous two. This is a relatively colourless movie. The Last Crusade is a successful motion picture with a lot of heart and energy even if it fails to meet the cinematic heights of the first film or even the second in terms of creativity. The character relationships, the supernatural ideas and the story are all strong elements and had Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had not been released, this would've been a terrific way to close off the series. Despite the highly positive reviews and financial success this movie garnered, there wouldn't be an Indiana Jones sequel for over a decade. More on that later.

    Simply the best part of Indiana Jones trilogy. Great script, great special effects (for those times), great atmosphere. Funny sense of humor and of course some romantics. Good rehabilitation from previous awful Temple of Doom. Last Crusade is a template for all adventure movies. This is supposed to be the final movie of Indiana's adventures. What can i say more? Awesome adventure movie of all times - without any compromises. This is an excellent film and many people still watch it to this day. PS there is a sequel, next part ...can't imagine what is about, but i have a feeling of a complete failure...

    Amongst all the IMDb reviews for Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade, one reviewer called it, "the most fun I ever had watching a movie". I, for one, cannot disagree with that assessment. The film is chock full of entertaining set-pieces, humour & the decision made to cast Sean Connery as Indiana Jones father Professor Henry Jones just worked wonderfully well. Alison Doody, in my opinion, was the best of the trilogies leading ladies. (Yes, i know there was a fourth but i am disregarding the later "Crystal Skull" which was a mistake). John Rhys-Davies was great & Denholm Elliott always seemed to enhance any movie he was ever in. Take "Trading Places", for instance. Most of the jokes used in the film are hilarious like when the "Jones boys" are forced to travel to Berlin during a book-burning nazi rally. After dressing up as a nazi officer & recovering his fathers diary, Indiana Jones inadvertently bumps into Adolf Hitler. Hitler naturally thinks he wants him to autograph his book & signs it. Not long after they board an airship to get them out of "the lions den". As the airship is awaiting take-off the SS officer Colonel Vogel comes on board looking for Indy & his dad. Indy sees him coming & dresses up as a ticket inspector. Colonel Vogel first finds his father Professor Jones trying to hide his face behind his newspaper. Indy challenges the SS officer to see his ticket, punches him, throws him out of a window & declares to the astonished passengers "No ticket". The passengers, not wishing anything similar happening to them, frantically all hold up their tickets. Two great gags amongst plenty more!. If anyone put me on the spot & asked what is your all-time favourite movie, I would say this one.

    I'd say this is tied with the original "Raiders of the Lost Ark." The dialogue and action mixes really well from beginning to end between both Indiana and his father. The holy grail was a very interesting artifact and made for a very interesting story. The entire movie includes some very famous scenes, including the boat scene, the library scene, and the second half of the movie is spot-on terrific. This is a great action movie and shows the power and desperate desire for immortality. This movie ended on a high note, and it should have ended that way. My advice is you shouldn't watch the fourth movie, though. This is a better ending then it could ever be. Plus, the soundtrack is amazing. Great to watch for fathers day, that's my plan

    After two masterpieces (one very underrated), the dual Spielberg and George Lucas had achieved complete success, and didn't plan to stop there. Spielberg promised Lucas since the beginning that if would make one he would have to make a trilogy. And they didn't disappointed closing their trilogy with a golden key with another underrated masterpiece that captured millions of fans and made Dr. Indiana Jones legendary forever. Our great adventure this time begins when our unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in another of his adventures in the middle of the Pacific ocean being beat-up by pirates. When Dr. Jones takes control of the situation and steal a strange diary from the leader, manages to escape with a job well done (the first in the trilogy). Days later, we see our hero back to his college teaching job educating young mind. After the class, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) chief and friend of Jones comes and warns him that Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), a relics collector want to offer him a new job. Shortly after the conversation with Walter, Jones discovers that the work involves the diary that he recovered from the pirates, showing the path to find the "Holy Grail" (for those who do not know, the cup that Christ drank at the Last Supper). And Jones also finds out that this job had already been offered to his father Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), who disappeared in a museum in Venice. Now Jones embarks on a mission to find his father with Marcus and the path to the Holy Grail, which will take them from a museum in Venice to the Arabic deserts with danger following them closely. I think Lucas and Spielberg in this film have decided to put all that was good in the first and second film and joined perfectly (which the last movie of a trilogy usually does). Proof of this is the return of Marcus making him a very important character in the adventure, and later the return of Sallah (John Rhys - Davies) who doesn't have much relevance, but it is fun to see him again since the first film. But the main thing that Lucas and Spielberg gave the story was to humanize the character of Indiana Jones. They do this through the first sequence of the film where we see a younger Indiana Jones, where we discovered many secrets of his past and finally the origin of the cowboy hat and the whip, even his name (and finally the reference to the Western genre in a film Spielberg). And when his father Henry Jones appears, and perhaps the best thing of the film. Since the first meeting in the movie of the Joneses, we already see the type of relationship between them two. Henry is a born lover of artifacts and history, giving more attention to study than the son who has created some resentment to his father. But their relationship throughout the film not only evolves, but thanks to the actors, they have an exceptional chemistry, making us laugh and love them even more. All this also thanks to the screenwriter Jeffrey Boam. Since the first film Lucas and Spielberg always changed the writers. Lawrence Kasdan in the first (considered one of the best screenplays ever written) and the couple Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz in the second (underrated). But Jeffrey didn't disappoint, making almost equal to Lawrence in the first, giving moments of dialog in the film, none of them gets to be boring, always flowing along very well in the story, especially between the Jones duo. Also filling the movie with a laughing out loud humor (perhaps the most humorous of the trilogy) but never gets to be stupid, but works very well in all the situations and the relationship of father and son. Mention direction and performances this time is stupid. Since the 1st movie Spielberg never disappoint in their direction, and wouldn't be different this time giving spectacular (and hilarious) action scenes from start to finish. And Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones never disappointed, and would not be this time (perhaps his best performance as the unforgettable and badass teacher). This also involves Sean Cornery giving an unforgettable character with a superb performance, and he and Harrison giving an incredible chemistry in their characters. Maybe not the best of the trilogy, but it's a fans favorite, and not for nothing. From a superb script that gives humor and soul to their characters, a marvelous direction, excellent performances, the best chemistry ever put between two characters in a movie. Spielberg and Lucas finished their trilogy giving heart and soul to Indiana Jones, reminding us why we love him, and making this saga forever legendary! 10/10

    When i was scrolling up and down in Steven Spielberg's IMDb profile, i had noticed movie Indiana Jones and i thought the movie would be great like rest of his movies.After watching this movie,it was more interesting than my imagination in another way.Exactly just before the climax , there is scene panzer fell down along with man.I paused right at the camera view of bottom-up falling panzer, i mesmerized. There was a clip art animation added some coloring effects with some graphic tools.The movie was so fun though some scenes are predictable.considering as a 1989 movie, director done it more than it deserve i thought.

    Third Indiana Jones film is a big improvement over the heavy handed 'Temple Of Doom', telling a more straight-forward story involving Indiana(Harrison Ford of course) going in search of both his missing father(Sean Connery, very well cast) and the Holy Grail, which entangles him once again with Nazis[1938 setting] and a brief meeting with Adolf Hitler... Steven Spielberg directs this globe-trotting adventure without missing a beat, and has the welcome return of Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies to the cast. Fine British actor Julian Glover plays the villain, and beautiful Allison Doody his conflicted love interest. Film is great fun all around, right until the rousing ending. Some story elements may not be new, but are still put across in a most entertaining package.

    Basically this is a remake of "Raiders Of The Lost Ark": Indiana Jones must beat the Nazis to obtaining the holy relic. The main differences are a lack of strong villains, and the inclusion of Indy's father in the story. Unfortunately Sean Connery and Harrison Ford are not convincing as father and son. The original film was an exciting roller-coaster ride, a remake of 1930's- style exotic adventures. This is the same without the excitement, or any good characters. Even the sword fight which takes place here to make up for the lack of one in the original (because rumor has it that Harrison Ford was too ill at the time to perform it) is tired and unexciting, as is the rest of the movie. The only good thing I can say about it is that it was better than the hideous "Temple Of Doom"-but that is a weak compliment indeed.

    Back as an adult, Indy's father is kidnapped and he must set out to find him. His only clues are his father's diary notes, which were mysteriously sent to him earlier that day. They lead him to Italy, where he meets the gorgeous blonde, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), who becomes an integral part of this story. Raiders of the Lost Ark was one hell of a ride, The Temple of Doom was too dark, too gruesome for some. The Last Crusade took the best elements of the first film. The Nazis, the search for a mystical religious artifact, Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies. The film starts with a sequence with Indy as a kid, obviously this was a appetiser for Lucas's idea of the Young Indiana Jones adventures. The problem is what was a very well utilised idea here led to a lame TV series. The addition of Sean Connery as Indy's father leads to some of the best comic films in the moment, with also some literate moments, plenty of action and very nifty special effects. Its a Saturday afternoon in the movies spectacular.

    Grade: A Well two are better then one as Harrison Ford has done a fine job with the films before, but when his father played by Sean Connery joins the fun, it's even better and that's what puts this film just above the first. The beginning is a flashback from Indy's childhood, before it carries over to the present, but one thing to look at is that his father ignores him when he finds something interesting because he is working on his own adventure. Then Indy is asked to help a friend named Donovan to look for the Holy Grail, but Indy says no and says that he should ask his father, but then learns that his father is already on it, but has gone missing. He goes looking for clues to the grail as well as to his father, and then goes to a building where his father is, but when they escape, Indy is fooled as the woman he thought loved him and was with him was actually the enemy with who else but Donovan, the man who hired him. They did something new, make the woman the bad guy. Now Indy and his father have to escape the burning building. They escape the Nazi's from the building and now they must go after Donovan because he took the book from Indy's father but the map's not in there. Instead, it's with Marcus and they capture Marcus and the map to the Holy Grail. This is now a great adventure because the scenes in finding the map are well done and the chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford is excellent. The two work very well together to keep us interested and make two scenes better, when they thought Indy died and the climax to the Holy Grail. Indy refused to help Donovan get to the grail, but he shoots his father and the grail is the only thing to keep him alive. Now when choosing the grail with the knight, and when Donovan dies, it is kind of disturbing as he ages very rapidly and layers of his skin start to disappear. Now the ending is typical, Indy chooses the right grail, saves his father, and they walk away in the sunset, literally with his father all alive and well, all the bad guys dead, and setting up the ending to one of the best trilogies ever. This film is an excellent sequel and my favorite and is one of the best conclusions to a trilogy when comparing it to its predecessors.

    Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the third of the highly popular Indiana Jones series and with fans generally divided on Temple of Doom and almost universally loathing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Last Crusade is often considered the best of the sequels though few consider it on par with Raiders of the Lost Ark.

The character relationships, the supernatural ideas and the story are all strong elements and had Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had not been released, this would've been a terrific way to close off the series. Despite the highly positive reviews and financial success this movie garnered, there wouldn't be an Indiana Jones sequel for over a decade. More on that later.

    After two masterpieces (one very underrated), the dual Spielberg and George Lucas had achieved complete success, and didn't plan to stop there. Spielberg promised Lucas since the beginning that if would make one he would have to make a trilogy. And they didn't disappointed closing their trilogy with a golden key with another underrated masterpiece that captured millions of fans and made Dr. Indiana Jones legendary forever. Our great adventure this time begins when our unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in another of his adventures in the middle of the Pacific ocean being beat-up by pirates. When Dr. Jones takes control of the situation and steal a strange diary from the leader, manages to escape with a job well done (the first in the trilogy). Days later, we see our hero back to his college teaching job educating young mind. After the class, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) chief and friend of Jones comes and warns him that Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), a relics collector want to offer him a new job. Shortly after the conversation with Walter, Jones discovers that the work involves the diary that he recovered from the pirates, showing the path to find the "Holy Grail" (for those who do not know, the cup that Christ drank at the Last Supper). And Jones also finds out that this job had already been offered to his father Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), who disappeared in a museum in Venice. Now Jones embarks on a mission to find his father with Marcus and the path to the Holy Grail, which will take them from a museum in Venice to the Arabic deserts with danger following them closely. I think Lucas and Spielberg in this film have decided to put all that was good in the first and second film and joined perfectly (which the last movie of a trilogy usually does). Proof of this is the return of Marcus making him a very important character in the adventure, and later the return of Sallah (John Rhys - Davies) who doesn't have much relevance, but it is fun to see him again since the first film. But the main thing that Lucas and Spielberg gave the story was to humanize the character of Indiana Jones. They do this through the first sequence of the film where we see a younger Indiana Jones, where we discovered many secrets of his past and finally the origin of the cowboy hat and the whip, even his name (and finally the reference to the Western genre in a film Spielberg). And when his father Henry Jones appears, and perhaps the best thing of the film. Since the first meeting in the movie of the Joneses, we already see the type of relationship between them two. Henry is a born lover of artifacts and history, giving more attention to study than the son who has created some resentment to his father. But their relationship throughout the film not only evolves, but thanks to the actors, they have an exceptional chemistry, making us laugh and love them even more. All this also thanks to the screenwriter Jeffrey Boam. Since the first film Lucas and Spielberg always changed the writers. Lawrence Kasdan in the first (considered one of the best screenplays ever written) and the couple Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz in the second (underrated). But Jeffrey didn't disappoint, making almost equal to Lawrence in the first, giving moments of dialog in the film, none of them gets to be boring, always flowing along very well in the story, especially between the Jones duo. Also filling the movie with a laughing out loud humor (perhaps the most humorous of the trilogy) but never gets to be stupid, but works very well in all the situations and the relationship of father and son. Mention direction and performances this time is stupid. Since the 1st movie Spielberg never disappoint in their direction, and wouldn't be different this time giving spectacular (and hilarious) action scenes from start to finish. And Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones never disappointed, and would not be this time (perhaps his best performance as the unforgettable and badass teacher). This also involves Sean Cornery giving an unforgettable character with a superb performance, and he and Harrison giving an incredible chemistry in their characters. Maybe not the best of the trilogy, but it's a fans favorite, and not for nothing. From a superb script that gives humor and soul to their characters, a marvelous direction, excellent performances, the best chemistry ever put between two characters in a movie. Spielberg and Lucas finished their trilogy giving heart and soul to Indiana Jones, reminding us why we love him, and making this saga forever legendary! 10/10

    When i was scrolling up and down in Steven Spielberg's IMDb profile, i had noticed movie Indiana Jones and i thought the movie would be great like rest of his movies.After watching this movie,it was more interesting than my imagination in another way.Exactly just before the climax , there is scene panzer fell down along with man.I paused right at the camera view of bottom-up falling panzer, i mesmerized. There was a clip art animation added some coloring effects with some graphic tools.The movie was so fun though some scenes are predictable.considering as a 1989 movie, director done it more than it deserve i thought.

    Third Indiana Jones film is a big improvement over the heavy handed 'Temple Of Doom', telling a more straight-forward story involving Indiana(Harrison Ford of course) going in search of both his missing father(Sean Connery, very well cast) and the Holy Grail, which entangles him once again with Nazis[1938 setting] and a brief meeting with Adolf Hitler... Steven Spielberg directs this globe-trotting adventure without missing a beat, and has the welcome return of Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies to the cast. Fine British actor Julian Glover plays the villain, and beautiful Allison Doody his conflicted love interest. Film is great fun all around, right until the rousing ending. Some story elements may not be new, but are still put across in a most entertaining package.

    Basically this is a remake of "Raiders Of The Lost Ark": Indiana Jones must beat the Nazis to obtaining the holy relic. The main differences are a lack of strong villains, and the inclusion of Indy's father in the story. Unfortunately Sean Connery and Harrison Ford are not convincing as father and son. The original film was an exciting roller-coaster ride, a remake of 1930's- style exotic adventures. This is the same without the excitement, or any good characters. Even the sword fight which takes place here to make up for the lack of one in the original (because rumor has it that Harrison Ford was too ill at the time to perform it) is tired and unexciting, as is the rest of the movie. The only good thing I can say about it is that it was better than the hideous "Temple Of Doom"-but that is a weak compliment indeed.

    Back as an adult, Indy's father is kidnapped and he must set out to find him. His only clues are his father's diary notes, which were mysteriously sent to him earlier that day. They lead him to Italy, where he meets the gorgeous blonde, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), who becomes an integral part of this story. Raiders of the Lost Ark was one hell of a ride, The Temple of Doom was too dark, too gruesome for some. The Last Crusade took the best elements of the first film. The Nazis, the search for a mystical religious artifact, Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies. The film starts with a sequence with Indy as a kid, obviously this was a appetiser for Lucas's idea of the Young Indiana Jones adventures. The problem is what was a very well utilised idea here led to a lame TV series. The addition of Sean Connery as Indy's father leads to some of the best comic films in the moment, with also some literate moments, plenty of action and very nifty special effects. Its a Saturday afternoon in the movies spectacular.

    Grade: A Well two are better then one as Harrison Ford has done a fine job with the films before, but when his father played by Sean Connery joins the fun, it's even better and that's what puts this film just above the first. The beginning is a flashback from Indy's childhood, before it carries over to the present, but one thing to look at is that his father ignores him when he finds something interesting because he is working on his own adventure. Then Indy is asked to help a friend named Donovan to look for the Holy Grail, but Indy says no and says that he should ask his father, but then learns that his father is already on it, but has gone missing. He goes looking for clues to the grail as well as to his father, and then goes to a building where his father is, but when they escape, Indy is fooled as the woman he thought loved him and was with him was actually the enemy with who else but Donovan, the man who hired him. They did something new, make the woman the bad guy. Now Indy and his father have to escape the burning building. They escape the Nazi's from the building and now they must go after Donovan because he took the book from Indy's father but the map's not in there. Instead, it's with Marcus and they capture Marcus and the map to the Holy Grail. This is now a great adventure because the scenes in finding the map are well done and the chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford is excellent. The two work very well together to keep us interested and make two scenes better, when they thought Indy died and the climax to the Holy Grail. Indy refused to help Donovan get to the grail, but he shoots his father and the grail is the only thing to keep him alive. Now when choosing the grail with the knight, and when Donovan dies, it is kind of disturbing as he ages very rapidly and layers of his skin start to disappear. Now the ending is typical, Indy chooses the right grail, saves his father, and they walk away in the sunset, literally with his father all alive and well, all the bad guys dead, and setting up the ending to one of the best trilogies ever. This film is an excellent sequel and my favorite and is one of the best conclusions to a trilogy when comparing it to its predecessors.

    Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the third of the highly popular Indiana Jones series and with fans generally divided on Temple of Doom and almost universally loathing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Last Crusade is often considered the best of the sequels though few consider it on par with Raiders of the Lost Ark. Last Crusade feels the most personal out of the films and represents Spielberg at his most emotional. Crusade lacks some of the originality that made Raiders such a gripping film as well as the darkness and relentlessness of Temple but it succeeds by itself as a fun and compelling adventure movie. The film opens in 1912 in Utah with young Indiana Jones as a teenage boy scout trying to retrieve an artifact known as the Cross of Coronado from a group of diggers. He fails in getting it but 26 years later, he finally succeeds in retrieving the Cross and donates it to his friend and colleague Marcus Brody's museum. He then meets Walter Donovan, an archaeologist and businessman. Donovan informs Indy that his father Henry Jones has gone missing whilst searching for the Holy Grail, the cup of life that Jesus Christ himself possessed, using an incomplete inscription. Indy is then sent his father's grail diary and decides to travel to Venice, where Henry was last located before he disappeared, with Marcus. They meet Henry's Austrian colleague Elsa Schneider who shows them to the library where Henry was before he went missing. In some catacombs underneath the library, they discover the tomb of a Knight of the First Crusade which contains the complete inscription of the guide to discovering the Grail's location. After being chased by a secret order devoted to protecting the Grail from evil intentions, Indy learns from a trustworthy member that his father is being held in a castle on the Austrian-German border. He succeeds in rescuing his father but Elsa and Donovan are revealed as being Nazi collaborators, with Donovan desiring the Grail for immortality. Spielberg stated that Last Crusade is about family and the relationship between Indiana and his father perfectly represents that. The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery is pitch perfect and one of the movie's great strengths. These two have a tense but also a clear love for one another, going on an adventure that can have an effect on the both of them in their lives. Much of the comedy in this movie also comes from the character of Henry. Connery gives a terrific performance, touching on the paternal aspect of the character whilst also making him a serious man who is also bumbling at times. Ford is also still effective as Indy, and even shows a more emotional side to the character than he did previously. Denholm Elliott is back as Marcus in a much larger role and the comedy in his character is played up more. John-Rhys Davies also returns as Sallah, also providing a relaxing touch to the film. Alison Doody is a different love interest than Temple of Doom's Willie. She's not a damsel in distress and but is also more vulnerable than Marion despite being a villain. Julian Glover's Donovan is a similar villain to the conniving Belloq from Raiders, except more of a megalomaniac. River Phoenix's cameo as the young Indy is also strong and an impressionable younger version of Harrison Ford. The various supernatural themes in this movie are explored in great detail here as they were in the past films. The quest for the Holy Grail is about gaining immortality and the path of the righteous. Gaining this is risky and could cost the life of the pursuer. Indy and Donovan are both looking for the Grail for different reasons. Donovan is interested in the Grail for his own personal gain and his wish for immortality. Indy desires it because out of love for his father and as a way to satisfy a relationship. As I've said, the key theme of this movie is family which is explored through the father and son journeying to achieve a life-time goal out of craving an adventure. Whenever one of them is seemingly about to die or is dead, we feel their pain. The action in this movie is also much more rousing than in the previous two, including a plane battle, a confrontation on a tank and evading the booby traps in the temple of the Grail. The visuals and lighting in this film are less extravagant in this movie than in the previous two. This is a relatively colourless movie. The Last Crusade is a successful motion picture with a lot of heart and energy even if it fails to meet the cinematic heights of the first film or even the second in terms of creativity. The character relationships, the supernatural ideas and the story are all strong elements and had Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had not been released, this would've been a terrific way to close off the series. Despite the highly positive reviews and financial success this movie garnered, there wouldn't be an Indiana Jones sequel for over a decade. More on that later.

    Simply the best part of Indiana Jones trilogy. Great script, great special effects (for those times), great atmosphere. Funny sense of humor and of course some romantics. Good rehabilitation from previous awful Temple of Doom. Last Crusade is a template for all adventure movies. This is supposed to be the final movie of Indiana's adventures. What can i say more? Awesome adventure movie of all times - without any compromises. This is an excellent film and many people still watch it to this day. PS there is a sequel, next part ...can't imagine what is about, but i have a feeling of a complete failure...

    Amongst all the IMDb reviews for Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade, one reviewer called it, "the most fun I ever had watching a movie". I, for one, cannot disagree with that assessment. The film is chock full of entertaining set-pieces, humour & the decision made to cast Sean Connery as Indiana Jones father Professor Henry Jones just worked wonderfully well. Alison Doody, in my opinion, was the best of the trilogies leading ladies. (Yes, i know there was a fourth but i am disregarding the later "Crystal Skull" which was a mistake). John Rhys-Davies was great & Denholm Elliott always seemed to enhance any movie he was ever in. Take "Trading Places", for instance. Most of the jokes used in the film are hilarious like when the "Jones boys" are forced to travel to Berlin during a book-burning nazi rally. After dressing up as a nazi officer & recovering his fathers diary, Indiana Jones inadvertently bumps into Adolf Hitler. Hitler naturally thinks he wants him to autograph his book & signs it. Not long after they board an airship to get them out of "the lions den". As the airship is awaiting take-off the SS officer Colonel Vogel comes on board looking for Indy & his dad. Indy sees him coming & dresses up as a ticket inspector. Colonel Vogel first finds his father Professor Jones trying to hide his face behind his newspaper. Indy challenges the SS officer to see his ticket, punches him, throws him out of a window & declares to the astonished passengers "No ticket". The passengers, not wishing anything similar happening to them, frantically all hold up their tickets. Two great gags amongst plenty more!. If anyone put me on the spot & asked what is your all-time favourite movie, I would say this one.

    I'd say this is tied with the original "Raiders of the Lost Ark." The dialogue and action mixes really well from beginning to end between both Indiana and his father. The holy grail was a very interesting artifact and made for a very interesting story. The entire movie includes some very famous scenes, including the boat scene, the library scene, and the second half of the movie is spot-on terrific. This is a great action movie and shows the power and desperate desire for immortality. This movie ended on a high note, and it should have ended that way. My advice is you shouldn't watch the fourth movie, though. This is a better ending then it could ever be. Plus, the soundtrack is amazing. Great to watch for fathers day, that's my plan

    After two masterpieces (one very underrated), the dual Spielberg and George Lucas had achieved complete success, and didn't plan to stop there. Spielberg promised Lucas since the beginning that if would make one he would have to make a trilogy. And they didn't disappointed closing their trilogy with a golden key with another underrated masterpiece that captured millions of fans and made Dr. Indiana Jones legendary forever. Our great adventure this time begins when our unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in another of his adventures in the middle of the Pacific ocean being beat-up by pirates. When Dr. Jones takes control of the situation and steal a strange diary from the leader, manages to escape with a job well done (the first in the trilogy). Days later, we see our hero back to his college teaching job educating young mind. After the class, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) chief and friend of Jones comes and warns him that Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), a relics collector want to offer him a new job. Shortly after the conversation with Walter, Jones discovers that the work involves the diary that he recovered from the pirates, showing the path to find the "Holy Grail" (for those who do not know, the cup that Christ drank at the Last Supper). And Jones also finds out that this job had already been offered to his father Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), who disappeared in a museum in Venice. Now Jones embarks on a mission to find his father with Marcus and the path to the Holy Grail, which will take them from a museum in Venice to the Arabic deserts with danger following them closely. I think Lucas and Spielberg in this film have decided to put all that was good in the first and second film and joined perfectly (which the last movie of a trilogy usually does). Proof of this is the return of Marcus making him a very important character in the adventure, and later the return of Sallah (John Rhys - Davies) who doesn't have much relevance, but it is fun to see him again since the first film. But the main thing that Lucas and Spielberg gave the story was to humanize the character of Indiana Jones. They do this through the first sequence of the film where we see a younger Indiana Jones, where we discovered many secrets of his past and finally the origin of the cowboy hat and the whip, even his name (and finally the reference to the Western genre in a film Spielberg). And when his father Henry Jones appears, and perhaps the best thing of the film. Since the first meeting in the movie of the Joneses, we already see the type of relationship between them two. Henry is a born lover of artifacts and history, giving more attention to study than the son who has created some resentment to his father. But their relationship throughout the film not only evolves, but thanks to the actors, they have an exceptional chemistry, making us laugh and love them even more. All this also thanks to the screenwriter Jeffrey Boam. Since the first film Lucas and Spielberg always changed the writers. Lawrence Kasdan in the first (considered one of the best screenplays ever written) and the couple Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz in the second (underrated). But Jeffrey didn't disappoint, making almost equal to Lawrence in the first, giving moments of dialog in the film, none of them gets to be boring, always flowing along very well in the story, especially between the Jones duo. Also filling the movie with a laughing out loud humor (perhaps the most humorous of the trilogy) but never gets to be stupid, but works very well in all the situations and the relationship of father and son. Mention direction and performances this time is stupid. Since the 1st movie Spielberg never disappoint in their direction, and wouldn't be different this time giving spectacular (and hilarious) action scenes from start to finish. And Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones never disappointed, and would not be this time (perhaps his best performance as the unforgettable and badass teacher). This also involves Sean Cornery giving an unforgettable character with a superb performance, and he and Harrison giving an incredible chemistry in their characters. Maybe not the best of the trilogy, but it's a fans favorite, and not for nothing. From a superb script that gives humor and soul to their characters, a marvelous direction, excellent performances, the best chemistry ever put between two characters in a movie. Spielberg and Lucas finished their trilogy giving heart and soul to Indiana Jones, reminding us why we love him, and making this saga forever legendary! 10/10

Julian Glover's Donovan is a similar villain to the conniving Belloq from Raiders, except more of a megalomaniac. River Phoenix's cameo as the young Indy is also strong and an impressionable younger version of Harrison Ford. The various supernatural themes in this movie are explored in great detail here as they were in the past films. The quest for the Holy Grail is about gaining immortality and the path of the righteous. Gaining this is risky and could cost the life of the pursuer. Indy and Donovan are both looking for the Grail for different reasons. Donovan is interested in the Grail for his own personal gain and his wish for immortality. Indy desires it because out of love for his father and as a way to satisfy a relationship. As I've said, the key theme of this movie is family which is explored through the father and son journeying to achieve a life-time goal out of craving an adventure. Whenever one of them is seemingly about to die or is dead, we feel their pain. The action in this movie is also much more rousing than in the previous two, including a plane battle, a confrontation on a tank and evading the booby traps in the temple of the Grail. The visuals and lighting in this film are less extravagant in this movie than in the previous two. This is a relatively colourless movie. The Last Crusade is a successful motion picture with a lot of heart and energy even if it fails to meet the cinematic heights of the first film or even the second in terms of creativity. The character relationships, the supernatural ideas and the story are all strong elements and had Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had not been released, this would've been a terrific way to close off the series. Despite the highly positive reviews and financial success this movie garnered, there wouldn't be an Indiana Jones sequel for over a decade. More on that later.

    Simply the best part of Indiana Jones trilogy. Great script, great special effects (for those times), great atmosphere. Funny sense of humor and of course some romantics. Good rehabilitation from previous awful Temple of Doom. Last Crusade is a template for all adventure movies. This is supposed to be the final movie of Indiana's adventures. What can i say more? Awesome adventure movie of all times - without any compromises. This is an excellent film and many people still watch it to this day. PS there is a sequel, next part ...can't imagine what is about, but i have a feeling of a complete failure...

    Amongst all the IMDb reviews for Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade, one reviewer called it, "the most fun I ever had watching a movie". I, for one, cannot disagree with that assessment. The film is chock full of entertaining set-pieces, humour & the decision made to cast Sean Connery as Indiana Jones father Professor Henry Jones just worked wonderfully well. Alison Doody, in my opinion, was the best of the trilogies leading ladies. (Yes, i know there was a fourth but i am disregarding the later "Crystal Skull" which was a mistake). John Rhys-Davies was great & Denholm Elliott always seemed to enhance any movie he was ever in. Take "Trading Places", for instance. Most of the jokes used in the film are hilarious like when the "Jones boys" are forced to travel to Berlin during a book-burning nazi rally. After dressing up as a nazi officer & recovering his fathers diary, Indiana Jones inadvertently bumps into Adolf Hitler. Hitler naturally thinks he wants him to autograph his book & signs it. Not long after they board an airship to get them out of "the lions den". As the airship is awaiting take-off the SS officer Colonel Vogel comes on board looking for Indy & his dad. Indy sees him coming & dresses up as a ticket inspector. Colonel Vogel first finds his father Professor Jones trying to hide his face behind his newspaper. Indy challenges the SS officer to see his ticket, punches him, throws him out of a window & declares to the astonished passengers "No ticket". The passengers, not wishing anything similar happening to them, frantically all hold up their tickets. Two great gags amongst plenty more!. If anyone put me on the spot & asked what is your all-time favourite movie, I would say this one.

    I'd say this is tied with the original "Raiders of the Lost Ark." The dialogue and action mixes really well from beginning to end between both Indiana and his father. The holy grail was a very interesting artifact and made for a very interesting story. The entire movie includes some very famous scenes, including the boat scene, the library scene, and the second half of the movie is spot-on terrific. This is a great action movie and shows the power and desperate desire for immortality. This movie ended on a high note, and it should have ended that way. My advice is you shouldn't watch the fourth movie, though. This is a better ending then it could ever be. Plus, the soundtrack is amazing. Great to watch for fathers day, that's my plan

    After two masterpieces (one very underrated), the dual Spielberg and George Lucas had achieved complete success, and didn't plan to stop there. Spielberg promised Lucas since the beginning that if would make one he would have to make a trilogy. And they didn't disappointed closing their trilogy with a golden key with another underrated masterpiece that captured millions of fans and made Dr. Indiana Jones legendary forever. Our great adventure this time begins when our unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in another of his adventures in the middle of the Pacific ocean being beat-up by pirates. When Dr. Jones takes control of the situation and steal a strange diary from the leader, manages to escape with a job well done (the first in the trilogy). Days later, we see our hero back to his college teaching job educating young mind. After the class, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) chief and friend of Jones comes and warns him that Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), a relics collector want to offer him a new job. Shortly after the conversation with Walter, Jones discovers that the work involves the diary that he recovered from the pirates, showing the path to find the "Holy Grail" (for those who do not know, the cup that Christ drank at the Last Supper). And Jones also finds out that this job had already been offered to his father Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), who disappeared in a museum in Venice. Now Jones embarks on a mission to find his father with Marcus and the path to the Holy Grail, which will take them from a museum in Venice to the Arabic deserts with danger following them closely. I think Lucas and Spielberg in this film have decided to put all that was good in the first and second film and joined perfectly (which the last movie of a trilogy usually does). Proof of this is the return of Marcus making him a very important character in the adventure, and later the return of Sallah (John Rhys - Davies) who doesn't have much relevance, but it is fun to see him again since the first film. But the main thing that Lucas and Spielberg gave the story was to humanize the character of Indiana Jones. They do this through the first sequence of the film where we see a younger Indiana Jones, where we discovered many secrets of his past and finally the origin of the cowboy hat and the whip, even his name (and finally the reference to the Western genre in a film Spielberg). And when his father Henry Jones appears, and perhaps the best thing of the film. Since the first meeting in the movie of the Joneses, we already see the type of relationship between them two. Henry is a born lover of artifacts and history, giving more attention to study than the son who has created some resentment to his father. But their relationship throughout the film not only evolves, but thanks to the actors, they have an exceptional chemistry, making us laugh and love them even more. All this also thanks to the screenwriter Jeffrey Boam. Since the first film Lucas and Spielberg always changed the writers. Lawrence Kasdan in the first (considered one of the best screenplays ever written) and the couple Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz in the second (underrated). But Jeffrey didn't disappoint, making almost equal to Lawrence in the first, giving moments of dialog in the film, none of them gets to be boring, always flowing along very well in the story, especially between the Jones duo. Also filling the movie with a laughing out loud humor (perhaps the most humorous of the trilogy) but never gets to be stupid, but works very well in all the situations and the relationship of father and son. Mention direction and performances this time is stupid. Since the 1st movie Spielberg never disappoint in their direction, and wouldn't be different this time giving spectacular (and hilarious) action scenes from start to finish. And Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones never disappointed, and would not be this time (perhaps his best performance as the unforgettable and badass teacher). This also involves Sean Cornery giving an unforgettable character with a superb performance, and he and Harrison giving an incredible chemistry in their characters. Maybe not the best of the trilogy, but it's a fans favorite, and not for nothing. From a superb script that gives humor and soul to their characters, a marvelous direction, excellent performances, the best chemistry ever put between two characters in a movie. Spielberg and Lucas finished their trilogy giving heart and soul to Indiana Jones, reminding us why we love him, and making this saga forever legendary! 10/10

    Third Indiana Jones film is a big improvement over the heavy handed 'Temple Of Doom', telling a more straight-forward story involving Indiana(Harrison Ford of course) going in search of both his missing father(Sean Connery, very well cast) and the Holy Grail, which entangles him once again with Nazis[1938 setting] and a brief meeting with Adolf Hitler... Steven Spielberg directs this globe-trotting adventure without missing a beat, and has the welcome return of Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies to the cast. Fine British actor Julian Glover plays the villain, and beautiful Allison Doody his conflicted love interest. Film is great fun all around, right until the rousing ending. Some story elements may not be new, but are still put across in a most entertaining package.

    Basically this is a remake of "Raiders Of The Lost Ark": Indiana Jones must beat the Nazis to obtaining the holy relic. The main differences are a lack of strong villains, and the inclusion of Indy's father in the story. Unfortunately Sean Connery and Harrison Ford are not convincing as father and son. The original film was an exciting roller-coaster ride, a remake of 1930's- style exotic adventures. This is the same without the excitement, or any good characters. Even the sword fight which takes place here to make up for the lack of one in the original (because rumor has it that Harrison Ford was too ill at the time to perform it) is tired and unexciting, as is the rest of the movie. The only good thing I can say about it is that it was better than the hideous "Temple Of Doom"-but that is a weak compliment indeed.

    Back as an adult, Indy's father is kidnapped and he must set out to find him. His only clues are his father's diary notes, which were mysteriously sent to him earlier that day. They lead him to Italy, where he meets the gorgeous blonde, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), who becomes an integral part of this story. Raiders of the Lost Ark was one hell of a ride, The Temple of Doom was too dark, too gruesome for some. The Last Crusade took the best elements of the first film. The Nazis, the search for a mystical religious artifact, Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies. The film starts with a sequence with Indy as a kid, obviously this was a appetiser for Lucas's idea of the Young Indiana Jones adventures. The problem is what was a very well utilised idea here led to a lame TV series. The addition of Sean Connery as Indy's father leads to some of the best comic films in the moment, with also some literate moments, plenty of action and very nifty special effects. Its a Saturday afternoon in the movies spectacular.

    Grade: A Well two are better then one as Harrison Ford has done a fine job with the films before, but when his father played by Sean Connery joins the fun, it's even better and that's what puts this film just above the first. The beginning is a flashback from Indy's childhood, before it carries over to the present, but one thing to look at is that his father ignores him when he finds something interesting because he is working on his own adventure. Then Indy is asked to help a friend named Donovan to look for the Holy Grail, but Indy says no and says that he should ask his father, but then learns that his father is already on it, but has gone missing. He goes looking for clues to the grail as well as to his father, and then goes to a building where his father is, but when they escape, Indy is fooled as the woman he thought loved him and was with him was actually the enemy with who else but Donovan, the man who hired him. They did something new, make the woman the bad guy. Now Indy and his father have to escape the burning building. They escape the Nazi's from the building and now they must go after Donovan because he took the book from Indy's father but the map's not in there. Instead, it's with Marcus and they capture Marcus and the map to the Holy Grail. This is now a great adventure because the scenes in finding the map are well done and the chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford is excellent. The two work very well together to keep us interested and make two scenes better, when they thought Indy died and the climax to the Holy Grail. Indy refused to help Donovan get to the grail, but he shoots his father and the grail is the only thing to keep him alive. Now when choosing the grail with the knight, and when Donovan dies, it is kind of disturbing as he ages very rapidly and layers of his skin start to disappear. Now the ending is typical, Indy chooses the right grail, saves his father, and they walk away in the sunset, literally with his father all alive and well, all the bad guys dead, and setting up the ending to one of the best trilogies ever. This film is an excellent sequel and my favorite and is one of the best conclusions to a trilogy when comparing it to its predecessors.

    Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the third of the highly popular Indiana Jones series and with fans generally divided on Temple of Doom and almost universally loathing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Last Crusade is often considered the best of the sequels though few consider it on par with Raiders of the Lost Ark. Last Crusade feels the most personal out of the films and represents Spielberg at his most emotional. Crusade lacks some of the originality that made Raiders such a gripping film as well as the darkness and relentlessness of Temple but it succeeds by itself as a fun and compelling adventure movie. The film opens in 1912 in Utah with young Indiana Jones as a teenage boy scout trying to retrieve an artifact known as the Cross of Coronado from a group of diggers. He fails in getting it but 26 years later, he finally succeeds in retrieving the Cross and donates it to his friend and colleague Marcus Brody's museum. He then meets Walter Donovan, an archaeologist and businessman. Donovan informs Indy that his father Henry Jones has gone missing whilst searching for the Holy Grail, the cup of life that Jesus Christ himself possessed, using an incomplete inscription. Indy is then sent his father's grail diary and decides to travel to Venice, where Henry was last located before he disappeared, with Marcus. They meet Henry's Austrian colleague Elsa Schneider who shows them to the library where Henry was before he went missing. In some catacombs underneath the library, they discover the tomb of a Knight of the First Crusade which contains the complete inscription of the guide to discovering the Grail's location. After being chased by a secret order devoted to protecting the Grail from evil intentions, Indy learns from a trustworthy member that his father is being held in a castle on the Austrian-German border. He succeeds in rescuing his father but Elsa and Donovan are revealed as being Nazi collaborators, with Donovan desiring the Grail for immortality. Spielberg stated that Last Crusade is about family and the relationship between Indiana and his father perfectly represents that. The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery is pitch perfect and one of the movie's great strengths. These two have a tense but also a clear love for one another, going on an adventure that can have an effect on the both of them in their lives. Much of the comedy in this movie also comes from the character of Henry. Connery gives a terrific performance, touching on the paternal aspect of the character whilst also making him a serious man who is also bumbling at times. Ford is also still effective as Indy, and even shows a more emotional side to the character than he did previously. Denholm Elliott is back as Marcus in a much larger role and the comedy in his character is played up more. John-Rhys Davies also returns as Sallah, also providing a relaxing touch to the film. Alison Doody is a different love interest than Temple of Doom's Willie. She's not a damsel in distress and but is also more vulnerable than Marion despite being a villain. Julian Glover's Donovan is a similar villain to the conniving Belloq from Raiders, except more of a megalomaniac. River Phoenix's cameo as the young Indy is also strong and an impressionable younger version of Harrison Ford. The various supernatural themes in this movie are explored in great detail here as they were in the past films. The quest for the Holy Grail is about gaining immortality and the path of the righteous. Gaining this is risky and could cost the life of the pursuer. Indy and Donovan are both looking for the Grail for different reasons. Donovan is interested in the Grail for his own personal gain and his wish for immortality. Indy desires it because out of love for his father and as a way to satisfy a relationship. As I've said, the key theme of this movie is family which is explored through the father and son journeying to achieve a life-time goal out of craving an adventure. Whenever one of them is seemingly about to die or is dead, we feel their pain. The action in this movie is also much more rousing than in the previous two, including a plane battle, a confrontation on a tank and evading the booby traps in the temple of the Grail. The visuals and lighting in this film are less extravagant in this movie than in the previous two. This is a relatively colourless movie. The Last Crusade is a successful motion picture with a lot of heart and energy even if it fails to meet the cinematic heights of the first film or even the second in terms of creativity. The character relationships, the supernatural ideas and the story are all strong elements and had Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had not been released, this would've been a terrific way to close off the series. Despite the highly positive reviews and financial success this movie garnered, there wouldn't be an Indiana Jones sequel for over a decade. More on that later.

    After two masterpieces (one very underrated), the dual Spielberg and George Lucas had achieved complete success, and didn't plan to stop there. Spielberg promised Lucas since the beginning that if would make one he would have to make a trilogy. And they didn't disappointed closing their trilogy with a golden key with another underrated masterpiece that captured millions of fans and made Dr. Indiana Jones legendary forever. Our great adventure this time begins when our unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in another of his adventures in the middle of the Pacific ocean being beat-up by pirates. When Dr. Jones takes control of the situation and steal a strange diary from the leader, manages to escape with a job well done (the first in the trilogy). Days later, we see our hero back to his college teaching job educating young mind. After the class, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) chief and friend of Jones comes and warns him that Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), a relics collector want to offer him a new job. Shortly after the conversation with Walter, Jones discovers that the work involves the diary that he recovered from the pirates, showing the path to find the "Holy Grail" (for those who do not know, the cup that Christ drank at the Last Supper). And Jones also finds out that this job had already been offered to his father Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), who disappeared in a museum in Venice. Now Jones embarks on a mission to find his father with Marcus and the path to the Holy Grail, which will take them from a museum in Venice to the Arabic deserts with danger following them closely. I think Lucas and Spielberg in this film have decided to put all that was good in the first and second film and joined perfectly (which the last movie of a trilogy usually does). Proof of this is the return of Marcus making him a very important character in the adventure, and later the return of Sallah (John Rhys - Davies) who doesn't have much relevance, but it is fun to see him again since the first film. But the main thing that Lucas and Spielberg gave the story was to humanize the character of Indiana Jones. They do this through the first sequence of the film where we see a younger Indiana Jones, where we discovered many secrets of his past and finally the origin of the cowboy hat and the whip, even his name (and finally the reference to the Western genre in a film Spielberg). And when his father Henry Jones appears, and perhaps the best thing of the film. Since the first meeting in the movie of the Joneses, we already see the type of relationship between them two. Henry is a born lover of artifacts and history, giving more attention to study than the son who has created some resentment to his father. But their relationship throughout the film not only evolves, but thanks to the actors, they have an exceptional chemistry, making us laugh and love them even more. All this also thanks to the screenwriter Jeffrey Boam. Since the first film Lucas and Spielberg always changed the writers. Lawrence Kasdan in the first (considered one of the best screenplays ever written) and the couple Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz in the second (underrated). But Jeffrey didn't disappoint, making almost equal to Lawrence in the first, giving moments of dialog in the film, none of them gets to be boring, always flowing along very well in the story, especially between the Jones duo. Also filling the movie with a laughing out loud humor (perhaps the most humorous of the trilogy) but never gets to be stupid, but works very well in all the situations and the relationship of father and son. Mention direction and performances this time is stupid. Since the 1st movie Spielberg never disappoint in their direction, and wouldn't be different this time giving spectacular (and hilarious) action scenes from start to finish. And Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones never disappointed, and would not be this time (perhaps his best performance as the unforgettable and badass teacher). This also involves Sean Cornery giving an unforgettable character with a superb performance, and he and Harrison giving an incredible chemistry in their characters. Maybe not the best of the trilogy, but it's a fans favorite, and not for nothing. From a superb script that gives humor and soul to their characters, a marvelous direction, excellent performances, the best chemistry ever put between two characters in a movie. Spielberg and Lucas finished their trilogy giving heart and soul to Indiana Jones, reminding us why we love him, and making this saga forever legendary! 10/10

    Basically this is a remake of "Raiders Of The Lost Ark": Indiana Jones must beat the Nazis to obtaining the holy relic. The main differences are a lack of strong villains, and the inclusion of Indy's father in the story. Unfortunately Sean Connery and Harrison Ford are not convincing as father and son. The original film was an exciting roller-coaster ride, a remake of 1930's- style exotic adventures. This is the same without the excitement, or any good characters. Even the sword fight which takes place here to make up for the lack of one in the original (because rumor has it that Harrison Ford was too ill at the time to perform it) is tired and unexciting, as is the rest of the movie. The only good thing I can say about it is that it was better than the hideous "Temple Of Doom"-but that is a weak compliment indeed.

    Back as an adult, Indy's father is kidnapped and he must set out to find him. His only clues are his father's diary notes, which were mysteriously sent to him earlier that day. They lead him to Italy, where he meets the gorgeous blonde, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), who becomes an integral part of this story. Raiders of the Lost Ark was one hell of a ride, The Temple of Doom was too dark, too gruesome for some. The Last Crusade took the best elements of the first film. The Nazis, the search for a mystical religious artifact, Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies. The film starts with a sequence with Indy as a kid, obviously this was a appetiser for Lucas's idea of the Young Indiana Jones adventures. The problem is what was a very well utilised idea here led to a lame TV series. The addition of Sean Connery as Indy's father leads to some of the best comic films in the moment, with also some literate moments, plenty of action and very nifty special effects. Its a Saturday afternoon in the movies spectacular.

    Grade: A Well two are better then one as Harrison Ford has done a fine job with the films before, but when his father played by Sean Connery joins the fun, it's even better and that's what puts this film just above the first. The beginning is a flashback from Indy's childhood, before it carries over to the present, but one thing to look at is that his father ignores him when he finds something interesting because he is working on his own adventure. Then Indy is asked to help a friend named Donovan to look for the Holy Grail, but Indy says no and says that he should ask his father, but then learns that his father is already on it, but has gone missing. He goes looking for clues to the grail as well as to his father, and then goes to a building where his father is, but when they escape, Indy is fooled as the woman he thought loved him and was with him was actually the enemy with who else but Donovan, the man who hired him. They did something new, make the woman the bad guy. Now Indy and his father have to escape the burning building. They escape the Nazi's from the building and now they must go after Donovan because he took the book from Indy's father but the map's not in there. Instead, it's with Marcus and they capture Marcus and the map to the Holy Grail. This is now a great adventure because the scenes in finding the map are well done and the chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford is excellent. The two work very well together to keep us interested and make two scenes better, when they thought Indy died and the climax to the Holy Grail. Indy refused to help Donovan get to the grail, but he shoots his father and the grail is the only thing to keep him alive. Now when choosing the grail with the knight, and when Donovan dies, it is kind of disturbing as he ages very rapidly and layers of his skin start to disappear. Now the ending is typical, Indy chooses the right grail, saves his father, and they walk away in the sunset, literally with his father all alive and well, all the bad guys dead, and setting up the ending to one of the best trilogies ever. This film is an excellent sequel and my favorite and is one of the best conclusions to a trilogy when comparing it to its predecessors.

    Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the third of the highly popular Indiana Jones series and with fans generally divided on Temple of Doom and almost universally loathing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Last Crusade is often considered the best of the sequels though few consider it on par with Raiders of the Lost Ark. Last Crusade feels the most personal out of the films and represents Spielberg at his most emotional. Crusade lacks some of the originality that made Raiders such a gripping film as well as the darkness and relentlessness of Temple but it succeeds by itself as a fun and compelling adventure movie. The film opens in 1912 in Utah with young Indiana Jones as a teenage boy scout trying to retrieve an artifact known as the Cross of Coronado from a group of diggers. He fails in getting it but 26 years later, he finally succeeds in retrieving the Cross and donates it to his friend and colleague Marcus Brody's museum. He then meets Walter Donovan, an archaeologist and businessman. Donovan informs Indy that his father Henry Jones has gone missing whilst searching for the Holy Grail, the cup of life that Jesus Christ himself possessed, using an incomplete inscription. Indy is then sent his father's grail diary and decides to travel to Venice, where Henry was last located before he disappeared, with Marcus. They meet Henry's Austrian colleague Elsa Schneider who shows them to the library where Henry was before he went missing. In some catacombs underneath the library, they discover the tomb of a Knight of the First Crusade which contains the complete inscription of the guide to discovering the Grail's location. After being chased by a secret order devoted to protecting the Grail from evil intentions, Indy learns from a trustworthy member that his father is being held in a castle on the Austrian-German border. He succeeds in rescuing his father but Elsa and Donovan are revealed as being Nazi collaborators, with Donovan desiring the Grail for immortality. Spielberg stated that Last Crusade is about family and the relationship between Indiana and his father perfectly represents that. The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery is pitch perfect and one of the movie's great strengths. These two have a tense but also a clear love for one another, going on an adventure that can have an effect on the both of them in their lives. Much of the comedy in this movie also comes from the character of Henry. Connery gives a terrific performance, touching on the paternal aspect of the character whilst also making him a serious man who is also bumbling at times. Ford is also still effective as Indy, and even shows a more emotional side to the character than he did previously. Denholm Elliott is back as Marcus in a much larger role and the comedy in his character is played up more. John-Rhys Davies also returns as Sallah, also providing a relaxing touch to the film. Alison Doody is a different love interest than Temple of Doom's Willie. She's not a damsel in distress and but is also more vulnerable than Marion despite being a villain. Julian Glover's Donovan is a similar villain to the conniving Belloq from Raiders, except more of a megalomaniac. River Phoenix's cameo as the young Indy is also strong and an impressionable younger version of Harrison Ford. The various supernatural themes in this movie are explored in great detail here as they were in the past films. The quest for the Holy Grail is about gaining immortality and the path of the righteous. Gaining this is risky and could cost the life of the pursuer. Indy and Donovan are both looking for the Grail for different reasons. Donovan is interested in the Grail for his own personal gain and his wish for immortality. Indy desires it because out of love for his father and as a way to satisfy a relationship. As I've said, the key theme of this movie is family which is explored through the father and son journeying to achieve a life-time goal out of craving an adventure. Whenever one of them is seemingly about to die or is dead, we feel their pain. The action in this movie is also much more rousing than in the previous two, including a plane battle, a confrontation on a tank and evading the booby traps in the temple of the Grail. The visuals and lighting in this film are less extravagant in this movie than in the previous two. This is a relatively colourless movie. The Last Crusade is a successful motion picture with a lot of heart and energy even if it fails to meet the cinematic heights of the first film or even the second in terms of creativity. The character relationships, the supernatural ideas and the story are all strong elements and had Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had not been released, this would've been a terrific way to close off the series. Despite the highly positive reviews and financial success this movie garnered, there wouldn't be an Indiana Jones sequel for over a decade. More on that later.

    Simply the best part of Indiana Jones trilogy. Great script, great special effects (for those times), great atmosphere. Funny sense of humor and of course some romantics. Good rehabilitation from previous awful Temple of Doom. Last Crusade is a template for all adventure movies. This is supposed to be the final movie of Indiana's adventures. What can i say more? Awesome adventure movie of all times - without any compromises. This is an excellent film and many people still watch it to this day. PS there is a sequel, next part ...can't imagine what is about, but i have a feeling of a complete failure...

    Amongst all the IMDb reviews for Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade, one reviewer called it, "the most fun I ever had watching a movie". I, for one, cannot disagree with that assessment. The film is chock full of entertaining set-pieces, humour & the decision made to cast Sean Connery as Indiana Jones father Professor Henry Jones just worked wonderfully well. Alison Doody, in my opinion, was the best of the trilogies leading ladies. (Yes, i know there was a fourth but i am disregarding the later "Crystal Skull" which was a mistake). John Rhys-Davies was great & Denholm Elliott always seemed to enhance any movie he was ever in. Take "Trading Places", for instance. Most of the jokes used in the film are hilarious like when the "Jones boys" are forced to travel to Berlin during a book-burning nazi rally. After dressing up as a nazi officer & recovering his fathers diary, Indiana Jones inadvertently bumps into Adolf Hitler. Hitler naturally thinks he wants him to autograph his book & signs it. Not long after they board an airship to get them out of "the lions den". As the airship is awaiting take-off the SS officer Colonel Vogel comes on board looking for Indy & his dad. Indy sees him coming & dresses up as a ticket inspector. Colonel Vogel first finds his father Professor Jones trying to hide his face behind his newspaper. Indy challenges the SS officer to see his ticket, punches him, throws him out of a window & declares to the astonished passengers "No ticket". The passengers, not wishing anything similar happening to them, frantically all hold up their tickets. Two great gags amongst plenty more!. If anyone put me on the spot & asked what is your all-time favourite movie, I would say this one.

    I'd say this is tied with the original "Raiders of the Lost Ark." The dialogue and action mixes really well from beginning to end between both Indiana and his father. The holy grail was a very interesting artifact and made for a very interesting story. The entire movie includes some very famous scenes, including the boat scene, the library scene, and the second half of the movie is spot-on terrific. This is a great action movie and shows the power and desperate desire for immortality. This movie ended on a high note, and it should have ended that way. My advice is you shouldn't watch the fourth movie, though. This is a better ending then it could ever be. Plus, the soundtrack is amazing. Great to watch for fathers day, that's my plan

    After two masterpieces (one very underrated), the dual Spielberg and George Lucas had achieved complete success, and didn't plan to stop there. Spielberg promised Lucas since the beginning that if would make one he would have to make a trilogy. And they didn't disappointed closing their trilogy with a golden key with another underrated masterpiece that captured millions of fans and made Dr. Indiana Jones legendary forever. Our great adventure this time begins when our unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in another of his adventures in the middle of the Pacific ocean being beat-up by pirates. When Dr. Jones takes control of the situation and steal a strange diary from the leader, manages to escape with a job well done (the first in the trilogy). Days later, we see our hero back to his college teaching job educating young mind. After the class, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) chief and friend of Jones comes and warns him that Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), a relics collector want to offer him a new job. Shortly after the conversation with Walter, Jones discovers that the work involves the diary that he recovered from the pirates, showing the path to find the "Holy Grail" (for those who do not know, the cup that Christ drank at the Last Supper). And Jones also finds out that this job had already been offered to his father Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), who disappeared in a museum in Venice. Now Jones embarks on a mission to find his father with Marcus and the path to the Holy Grail, which will take them from a museum in Venice to the Arabic deserts with danger following them closely. I think Lucas and Spielberg in this film have decided to put all that was good in the first and second film and joined perfectly (which the last movie of a trilogy usually does). Proof of this is the return of Marcus making him a very important character in the adventure, and later the return of Sallah (John Rhys - Davies) who doesn't have much relevance, but it is fun to see him again since the first film. But the main thing that Lucas and Spielberg gave the story was to humanize the character of Indiana Jones. They do this through the first sequence of the film where we see a younger Indiana Jones, where we discovered many secrets of his past and finally the origin of the cowboy hat and the whip, even his name (and finally the reference to the Western genre in a film Spielberg). And when his father Henry Jones appears, and perhaps the best thing of the film. Since the first meeting in the movie of the Joneses, we already see the type of relationship between them two. Henry is a born lover of artifacts and history, giving more attention to study than the son who has created some resentment to his father. But their relationship throughout the film not only evolves, but thanks to the actors, they have an exceptional chemistry, making us laugh and love them even more. All this also thanks to the screenwriter Jeffrey Boam. Since the first film Lucas and Spielberg always changed the writers. Lawrence Kasdan in the first (considered one of the best screenplays ever written) and the couple Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz in the second (underrated). But Jeffrey didn't disappoint, making almost equal to Lawrence in the first, giving moments of dialog in the film, none of them gets to be boring, always flowing along very well in the story, especially between the Jones duo. Also filling the movie with a laughing out loud humor (perhaps the most humorous of the trilogy) but never gets to be stupid, but works very well in all the situations and the relationship of father and son. Mention direction and performances this time is stupid. Since the 1st movie Spielberg never disappoint in their direction, and wouldn't be different this time giving spectacular (and hilarious) action scenes from start to finish. And Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones never disappointed, and would not be this time (perhaps his best performance as the unforgettable and badass teacher). This also involves Sean Cornery giving an unforgettable character with a superb performance, and he and Harrison giving an incredible chemistry in their characters. Maybe not the best of the trilogy, but it's a fans favorite, and not for nothing. From a superb script that gives humor and soul to their characters, a marvelous direction, excellent performances, the best chemistry ever put between two characters in a movie. Spielberg and Lucas finished their trilogy giving heart and soul to Indiana Jones, reminding us why we love him, and making this saga forever legendary! 10/10

    When i was scrolling up and down in Steven Spielberg's IMDb profile, i had noticed movie Indiana Jones and i thought the movie would be great like rest of his movies.After watching this movie,it was more interesting than my imagination in another way.Exactly just before the climax , there is scene panzer fell down along with man.I paused right at the camera view of bottom-up falling panzer, i mesmerized. There was a clip art animation added some coloring effects with some graphic tools.The movie was so fun though some scenes are predictable.considering as a 1989 movie, director done it more than it deserve i thought.

    Third Indiana Jones film is a big improvement over the heavy handed 'Temple Of Doom', telling a more straight-forward story involving Indiana(Harrison Ford of course) going in search of both his missing father(Sean Connery, very well cast) and the Holy Grail, which entangles him once again with Nazis[1938 setting] and a brief meeting with Adolf Hitler... Steven Spielberg directs this globe-trotting adventure without missing a beat, and has the welcome return of Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies to the cast. Fine British actor Julian Glover plays the villain, and beautiful Allison Doody his conflicted love interest. Film is great fun all around, right until the rousing ending. Some story elements may not be new, but are still put across in a most entertaining package.

He fails in getting it but 26 years later, he finally succeeds in retrieving the Cross and donates it to his friend and colleague Marcus Brody's museum.

Donovan informs Indy that his father Henry Jones has gone missing whilst searching for the Holy Grail, the cup of life that Jesus Christ himself possessed, using an incomplete inscription. Indy is then sent his father's grail diary and decides to travel to Venice, where Henry was last located before he disappeared, with Marcus.

Despite the highly positive reviews and financial success this movie garnered, there wouldn't be an Indiana Jones sequel for over a decade. More on that later.

    I'd say this is tied with the original "Raiders of the Lost Ark." The dialogue and action mixes really well from beginning to end between both Indiana and his father. The holy grail was a very interesting artifact and made for a very interesting story. The entire movie includes some very famous scenes, including the boat scene, the library scene, and the second half of the movie is spot-on terrific. This is a great action movie and shows the power and desperate desire for immortality. This movie ended on a high note, and it should have ended that way. My advice is you shouldn't watch the fourth movie, though. This is a better ending then it could ever be. Plus, the soundtrack is amazing. Great to watch for fathers day, that's my plan

    After two masterpieces (one very underrated), the dual Spielberg and George Lucas had achieved complete success, and didn't plan to stop there. Spielberg promised Lucas since the beginning that if would make one he would have to make a trilogy. And they didn't disappointed closing their trilogy with a golden key with another underrated masterpiece that captured millions of fans and made Dr. Indiana Jones legendary forever. Our great adventure this time begins when our unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in another of his adventures in the middle of the Pacific ocean being beat-up by pirates. When Dr. Jones takes control of the situation and steal a strange diary from the leader, manages to escape with a job well done (the first in the trilogy). Days later, we see our hero back to his college teaching job educating young mind. After the class, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) chief and friend of Jones comes and warns him that Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), a relics collector want to offer him a new job. Shortly after the conversation with Walter, Jones discovers that the work involves the diary that he recovered from the pirates, showing the path to find the "Holy Grail" (for those who do not know, the cup that Christ drank at the Last Supper). And Jones also finds out that this job had already been offered to his father Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), who disappeared in a museum in Venice. Now Jones embarks on a mission to find his father with Marcus and the path to the Holy Grail, which will take them from a museum in Venice to the Arabic deserts with danger following them closely. I think Lucas and Spielberg in this film have decided to put all that was good in the first and second film and joined perfectly (which the last movie of a trilogy usually does). Proof of this is the return of Marcus making him a very important character in the adventure, and later the return of Sallah (John Rhys - Davies) who doesn't have much relevance, but it is fun to see him again since the first film. But the main thing that Lucas and Spielberg gave the story was to humanize the character of Indiana Jones. They do this through the first sequence of the film where we see a younger Indiana Jones, where we discovered many secrets of his past and finally the origin of the cowboy hat and the whip, even his name (and finally the reference to the Western genre in a film Spielberg). And when his father Henry Jones appears, and perhaps the best thing of the film. Since the first meeting in the movie of the Joneses, we already see the type of relationship between them two. Henry is a born lover of artifacts and history, giving more attention to study than the son who has created some resentment to his father. But their relationship throughout the film not only evolves, but thanks to the actors, they have an exceptional chemistry, making us laugh and love them even more. All this also thanks to the screenwriter Jeffrey Boam. Since the first film Lucas and Spielberg always changed the writers. Lawrence Kasdan in the first (considered one of the best screenplays ever written) and the couple Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz in the second (underrated). But Jeffrey didn't disappoint, making almost equal to Lawrence in the first, giving moments of dialog in the film, none of them gets to be boring, always flowing along very well in the story, especially between the Jones duo. Also filling the movie with a laughing out loud humor (perhaps the most humorous of the trilogy) but never gets to be stupid, but works very well in all the situations and the relationship of father and son. Mention direction and performances this time is stupid. Since the 1st movie Spielberg never disappoint in their direction, and wouldn't be different this time giving spectacular (and hilarious) action scenes from start to finish. And Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones never disappointed, and would not be this time (perhaps his best performance as the unforgettable and badass teacher). This also involves Sean Cornery giving an unforgettable character with a superb performance, and he and Harrison giving an incredible chemistry in their characters. Maybe not the best of the trilogy, but it's a fans favorite, and not for nothing. From a superb script that gives humor and soul to their characters, a marvelous direction, excellent performances, the best chemistry ever put between two characters in a movie. Spielberg and Lucas finished their trilogy giving heart and soul to Indiana Jones, reminding us why we love him, and making this saga forever legendary! 10/10

There was a clip art animation added some coloring effects with some graphic tools.The movie was so fun though some scenes are predictable.considering as a 1989 movie, director done it more than it deserve i thought.

    Third Indiana Jones film is a big improvement over the heavy handed 'Temple Of Doom', telling a more straight-forward story involving Indiana(Harrison Ford of course) going in search of both his missing father(Sean Connery, very well cast) and the Holy Grail, which entangles him once again with Nazis[1938 setting] and a brief meeting with Adolf Hitler... Steven Spielberg directs this globe-trotting adventure without missing a beat, and has the welcome return of Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies to the cast. Fine British actor Julian Glover plays the villain, and beautiful Allison Doody his conflicted love interest. Film is great fun all around, right until the rousing ending. Some story elements may not be new, but are still put across in a most entertaining package.

    Basically this is a remake of "Raiders Of The Lost Ark": Indiana Jones must beat the Nazis to obtaining the holy relic. The main differences are a lack of strong villains, and the inclusion of Indy's father in the story. Unfortunately Sean Connery and Harrison Ford are not convincing as father and son. The original film was an exciting roller-coaster ride, a remake of 1930's- style exotic adventures. This is the same without the excitement, or any good characters. Even the sword fight which takes place here to make up for the lack of one in the original (because rumor has it that Harrison Ford was too ill at the time to perform it) is tired and unexciting, as is the rest of the movie. The only good thing I can say about it is that it was better than the hideous "Temple Of Doom"-but that is a weak compliment indeed.

    Back as an adult, Indy's father is kidnapped and he must set out to find him. His only clues are his father's diary notes, which were mysteriously sent to him earlier that day. They lead him to Italy, where he meets the gorgeous blonde, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), who becomes an integral part of this story. Raiders of the Lost Ark was one hell of a ride, The Temple of Doom was too dark, too gruesome for some. The Last Crusade took the best elements of the first film. The Nazis, the search for a mystical religious artifact, Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies. The film starts with a sequence with Indy as a kid, obviously this was a appetiser for Lucas's idea of the Young Indiana Jones adventures. The problem is what was a very well utilised idea here led to a lame TV series. The addition of Sean Connery as Indy's father leads to some of the best comic films in the moment, with also some literate moments, plenty of action and very nifty special effects. Its a Saturday afternoon in the movies spectacular.

    Grade: A Well two are better then one as Harrison Ford has done a fine job with the films before, but when his father played by Sean Connery joins the fun, it's even better and that's what puts this film just above the first. The beginning is a flashback from Indy's childhood, before it carries over to the present, but one thing to look at is that his father ignores him when he finds something interesting because he is working on his own adventure. Then Indy is asked to help a friend named Donovan to look for the Holy Grail, but Indy says no and says that he should ask his father, but then learns that his father is already on it, but has gone missing. He goes looking for clues to the grail as well as to his father, and then goes to a building where his father is, but when they escape, Indy is fooled as the woman he thought loved him and was with him was actually the enemy with who else but Donovan, the man who hired him. They did something new, make the woman the bad guy. Now Indy and his father have to escape the burning building. They escape the Nazi's from the building and now they must go after Donovan because he took the book from Indy's father but the map's not in there. Instead, it's with Marcus and they capture Marcus and the map to the Holy Grail. This is now a great adventure because the scenes in finding the map are well done and the chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford is excellent. The two work very well together to keep us interested and make two scenes better, when they thought Indy died and the climax to the Holy Grail. Indy refused to help Donovan get to the grail, but he shoots his father and the grail is the only thing to keep him alive. Now when choosing the grail with the knight, and when Donovan dies, it is kind of disturbing as he ages very rapidly and layers of his skin start to disappear. Now the ending is typical, Indy chooses the right grail, saves his father, and they walk away in the sunset, literally with his father all alive and well, all the bad guys dead, and setting up the ending to one of the best trilogies ever. This film is an excellent sequel and my favorite and is one of the best conclusions to a trilogy when comparing it to its predecessors.

    Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the third of the highly popular Indiana Jones series and with fans generally divided on Temple of Doom and almost universally loathing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Last Crusade is often considered the best of the sequels though few consider it on par with Raiders of the Lost Ark. Last Crusade feels the most personal out of the films and represents Spielberg at his most emotional. Crusade lacks some of the originality that made Raiders such a gripping film as well as the darkness and relentlessness of Temple but it succeeds by itself as a fun and compelling adventure movie. The film opens in 1912 in Utah with young Indiana Jones as a teenage boy scout trying to retrieve an artifact known as the Cross of Coronado from a group of diggers. He fails in getting it but 26 years later, he finally succeeds in retrieving the Cross and donates it to his friend and colleague Marcus Brody's museum. He then meets Walter Donovan, an archaeologist and businessman. Donovan informs Indy that his father Henry Jones has gone missing whilst searching for the Holy Grail, the cup of life that Jesus Christ himself possessed, using an incomplete inscription. Indy is then sent his father's grail diary and decides to travel to Venice, where Henry was last located before he disappeared, with Marcus. They meet Henry's Austrian colleague Elsa Schneider who shows them to the library where Henry was before he went missing. In some catacombs underneath the library, they discover the tomb of a Knight of the First Crusade which contains the complete inscription of the guide to discovering the Grail's location. After being chased by a secret order devoted to protecting the Grail from evil intentions, Indy learns from a trustworthy member that his father is being held in a castle on the Austrian-German border. He succeeds in rescuing his father but Elsa and Donovan are revealed as being Nazi collaborators, with Donovan desiring the Grail for immortality. Spielberg stated that Last Crusade is about family and the relationship between Indiana and his father perfectly represents that. The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery is pitch perfect and one of the movie's great strengths. These two have a tense but also a clear love for one another, going on an adventure that can have an effect on the both of them in their lives. Much of the comedy in this movie also comes from the character of Henry. Connery gives a terrific performance, touching on the paternal aspect of the character whilst also making him a serious man who is also bumbling at times. Ford is also still effective as Indy, and even shows a more emotional side to the character than he did previously. Denholm Elliott is back as Marcus in a much larger role and the comedy in his character is played up more. John-Rhys Davies also returns as Sallah, also providing a relaxing touch to the film. Alison Doody is a different love interest than Temple of Doom's Willie. She's not a damsel in distress and but is also more vulnerable than Marion despite being a villain. Julian Glover's Donovan is a similar villain to the conniving Belloq from Raiders, except more of a megalomaniac. River Phoenix's cameo as the young Indy is also strong and an impressionable younger version of Harrison Ford. The various supernatural themes in this movie are explored in great detail here as they were in the past films. The quest for the Holy Grail is about gaining immortality and the path of the righteous. Gaining this is risky and could cost the life of the pursuer. Indy and Donovan are both looking for the Grail for different reasons. Donovan is interested in the Grail for his own personal gain and his wish for immortality. Indy desires it because out of love for his father and as a way to satisfy a relationship. As I've said, the key theme of this movie is family which is explored through the father and son journeying to achieve a life-time goal out of craving an adventure. Whenever one of them is seemingly about to die or is dead, we feel their pain. The action in this movie is also much more rousing than in the previous two, including a plane battle, a confrontation on a tank and evading the booby traps in the temple of the Grail. The visuals and lighting in this film are less extravagant in this movie than in the previous two. This is a relatively colourless movie. The Last Crusade is a successful motion picture with a lot of heart and energy even if it fails to meet the cinematic heights of the first film or even the second in terms of creativity. The character relationships, the supernatural ideas and the story are all strong elements and had Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had not been released, this would've been a terrific way to close off the series. Despite the highly positive reviews and financial success this movie garnered, there wouldn't be an Indiana Jones sequel for over a decade. More on that later.

    Simply the best part of Indiana Jones trilogy. Great script, great special effects (for those times), great atmosphere. Funny sense of humor and of course some romantics. Good rehabilitation from previous awful Temple of Doom. Last Crusade is a template for all adventure movies. This is supposed to be the final movie of Indiana's adventures. What can i say more? Awesome adventure movie of all times - without any compromises. This is an excellent film and many people still watch it to this day. PS there is a sequel, next part ...can't imagine what is about, but i have a feeling of a complete failure...

    Amongst all the IMDb reviews for Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade, one reviewer called it, "the most fun I ever had watching a movie". I, for one, cannot disagree with that assessment. The film is chock full of entertaining set-pieces, humour & the decision made to cast Sean Connery as Indiana Jones father Professor Henry Jones just worked wonderfully well. Alison Doody, in my opinion, was the best of the trilogies leading ladies. (Yes, i know there was a fourth but i am disregarding the later "Crystal Skull" which was a mistake). John Rhys-Davies was great & Denholm Elliott always seemed to enhance any movie he was ever in. Take "Trading Places", for instance. Most of the jokes used in the film are hilarious like when the "Jones boys" are forced to travel to Berlin during a book-burning nazi rally. After dressing up as a nazi officer & recovering his fathers diary, Indiana Jones inadvertently bumps into Adolf Hitler. Hitler naturally thinks he wants him to autograph his book & signs it. Not long after they board an airship to get them out of "the lions den". As the airship is awaiting take-off the SS officer Colonel Vogel comes on board looking for Indy & his dad. Indy sees him coming & dresses up as a ticket inspector. Colonel Vogel first finds his father Professor Jones trying to hide his face behind his newspaper. Indy challenges the SS officer to see his ticket, punches him, throws him out of a window & declares to the astonished passengers "No ticket". The passengers, not wishing anything similar happening to them, frantically all hold up their tickets. Two great gags amongst plenty more!. If anyone put me on the spot & asked what is your all-time favourite movie, I would say this one.

    After two masterpieces (one very underrated), the dual Spielberg and George Lucas had achieved complete success, and didn't plan to stop there. Spielberg promised Lucas since the beginning that if would make one he would have to make a trilogy. And they didn't disappointed closing their trilogy with a golden key with another underrated masterpiece that captured millions of fans and made Dr. Indiana Jones legendary forever. Our great adventure this time begins when our unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in another of his adventures in the middle of the Pacific ocean being beat-up by pirates. When Dr. Jones takes control of the situation and steal a strange diary from the leader, manages to escape with a job well done (the first in the trilogy). Days later, we see our hero back to his college teaching job educating young mind. After the class, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) chief and friend of Jones comes and warns him that Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), a relics collector want to offer him a new job. Shortly after the conversation with Walter, Jones discovers that the work involves the diary that he recovered from the pirates, showing the path to find the "Holy Grail" (for those who do not know, the cup that Christ drank at the Last Supper). And Jones also finds out that this job had already been offered to his father Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), who disappeared in a museum in Venice. Now Jones embarks on a mission to find his father with Marcus and the path to the Holy Grail, which will take them from a museum in Venice to the Arabic deserts with danger following them closely. I think Lucas and Spielberg in this film have decided to put all that was good in the first and second film and joined perfectly (which the last movie of a trilogy usually does). Proof of this is the return of Marcus making him a very important character in the adventure, and later the return of Sallah (John Rhys - Davies) who doesn't have much relevance, but it is fun to see him again since the first film. But the main thing that Lucas and Spielberg gave the story was to humanize the character of Indiana Jones. They do this through the first sequence of the film where we see a younger Indiana Jones, where we discovered many secrets of his past and finally the origin of the cowboy hat and the whip, even his name (and finally the reference to the Western genre in a film Spielberg). And when his father Henry Jones appears, and perhaps the best thing of the film. Since the first meeting in the movie of the Joneses, we already see the type of relationship between them two. Henry is a born lover of artifacts and history, giving more attention to study than the son who has created some resentment to his father. But their relationship throughout the film not only evolves, but thanks to the actors, they have an exceptional chemistry, making us laugh and love them even more. All this also thanks to the screenwriter Jeffrey Boam. Since the first film Lucas and Spielberg always changed the writers. Lawrence Kasdan in the first (considered one of the best screenplays ever written) and the couple Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz in the second (underrated). But Jeffrey didn't disappoint, making almost equal to Lawrence in the first, giving moments of dialog in the film, none of them gets to be boring, always flowing along very well in the story, especially between the Jones duo. Also filling the movie with a laughing out loud humor (perhaps the most humorous of the trilogy) but never gets to be stupid, but works very well in all the situations and the relationship of father and son. Mention direction and performances this time is stupid. Since the 1st movie Spielberg never disappoint in their direction, and wouldn't be different this time giving spectacular (and hilarious) action scenes from start to finish. And Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones never disappointed, and would not be this time (perhaps his best performance as the unforgettable and badass teacher). This also involves Sean Cornery giving an unforgettable character with a superb performance, and he and Harrison giving an incredible chemistry in their characters. Maybe not the best of the trilogy, but it's a fans favorite, and not for nothing. From a superb script that gives humor and soul to their characters, a marvelous direction, excellent performances, the best chemistry ever put between two characters in a movie. Spielberg and Lucas finished their trilogy giving heart and soul to Indiana Jones, reminding us why we love him, and making this saga forever legendary! 10/10

This film is an excellent sequel and my favorite and is one of the best conclusions to a trilogy when comparing it to its predecessors.

    Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the third of the highly popular Indiana Jones series and with fans generally divided on Temple of Doom and almost universally loathing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Last Crusade is often considered the best of the sequels though few consider it on par with Raiders of the Lost Ark. Last Crusade feels the most personal out of the films and represents Spielberg at his most emotional. Crusade lacks some of the originality that made Raiders such a gripping film as well as the darkness and relentlessness of Temple but it succeeds by itself as a fun and compelling adventure movie. The film opens in 1912 in Utah with young Indiana Jones as a teenage boy scout trying to retrieve an artifact known as the Cross of Coronado from a group of diggers. He fails in getting it but 26 years later, he finally succeeds in retrieving the Cross and donates it to his friend and colleague Marcus Brody's museum. He then meets Walter Donovan, an archaeologist and businessman. Donovan informs Indy that his father Henry Jones has gone missing whilst searching for the Holy Grail, the cup of life that Jesus Christ himself possessed, using an incomplete inscription. Indy is then sent his father's grail diary and decides to travel to Venice, where Henry was last located before he disappeared, with Marcus. They meet Henry's Austrian colleague Elsa Schneider who shows them to the library where Henry was before he went missing. In some catacombs underneath the library, they discover the tomb of a Knight of the First Crusade which contains the complete inscription of the guide to discovering the Grail's location. After being chased by a secret order devoted to protecting the Grail from evil intentions, Indy learns from a trustworthy member that his father is being held in a castle on the Austrian-German border. He succeeds in rescuing his father but Elsa and Donovan are revealed as being Nazi collaborators, with Donovan desiring the Grail for immortality. Spielberg stated that Last Crusade is about family and the relationship between Indiana and his father perfectly represents that. The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery is pitch perfect and one of the movie's great strengths. These two have a tense but also a clear love for one another, going on an adventure that can have an effect on the both of them in their lives. Much of the comedy in this movie also comes from the character of Henry. Connery gives a terrific performance, touching on the paternal aspect of the character whilst also making him a serious man who is also bumbling at times. Ford is also still effective as Indy, and even shows a more emotional side to the character than he did previously. Denholm Elliott is back as Marcus in a much larger role and the comedy in his character is played up more. John-Rhys Davies also returns as Sallah, also providing a relaxing touch to the film. Alison Doody is a different love interest than Temple of Doom's Willie. She's not a damsel in distress and but is also more vulnerable than Marion despite being a villain. Julian Glover's Donovan is a similar villain to the conniving Belloq from Raiders, except more of a megalomaniac. River Phoenix's cameo as the young Indy is also strong and an impressionable younger version of Harrison Ford. The various supernatural themes in this movie are explored in great detail here as they were in the past films. The quest for the Holy Grail is about gaining immortality and the path of the righteous. Gaining this is risky and could cost the life of the pursuer. Indy and Donovan are both looking for the Grail for different reasons. Donovan is interested in the Grail for his own personal gain and his wish for immortality. Indy desires it because out of love for his father and as a way to satisfy a relationship. As I've said, the key theme of this movie is family which is explored through the father and son journeying to achieve a life-time goal out of craving an adventure. Whenever one of them is seemingly about to die or is dead, we feel their pain. The action in this movie is also much more rousing than in the previous two, including a plane battle, a confrontation on a tank and evading the booby traps in the temple of the Grail. The visuals and lighting in this film are less extravagant in this movie than in the previous two. This is a relatively colourless movie. The Last Crusade is a successful motion picture with a lot of heart and energy even if it fails to meet the cinematic heights of the first film or even the second in terms of creativity. The character relationships, the supernatural ideas and the story are all strong elements and had Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had not been released, this would've been a terrific way to close off the series. Despite the highly positive reviews and financial success this movie garnered, there wouldn't be an Indiana Jones sequel for over a decade. More on that later.

    Simply the best part of Indiana Jones trilogy. Great script, great special effects (for those times), great atmosphere. Funny sense of humor and of course some romantics. Good rehabilitation from previous awful Temple of Doom. Last Crusade is a template for all adventure movies. This is supposed to be the final movie of Indiana's adventures. What can i say more? Awesome adventure movie of all times - without any compromises. This is an excellent film and many people still watch it to this day. PS there is a sequel, next part ...can't imagine what is about, but i have a feeling of a complete failure...

    Amongst all the IMDb reviews for Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade, one reviewer called it, "the most fun I ever had watching a movie". I, for one, cannot disagree with that assessment. The film is chock full of entertaining set-pieces, humour & the decision made to cast Sean Connery as Indiana Jones father Professor Henry Jones just worked wonderfully well. Alison Doody, in my opinion, was the best of the trilogies leading ladies. (Yes, i know there was a fourth but i am disregarding the later "Crystal Skull" which was a mistake). John Rhys-Davies was great & Denholm Elliott always seemed to enhance any movie he was ever in. Take "Trading Places", for instance. Most of the jokes used in the film are hilarious like when the "Jones boys" are forced to travel to Berlin during a book-burning nazi rally. After dressing up as a nazi officer & recovering his fathers diary, Indiana Jones inadvertently bumps into Adolf Hitler. Hitler naturally thinks he wants him to autograph his book & signs it. Not long after they board an airship to get them out of "the lions den". As the airship is awaiting take-off the SS officer Colonel Vogel comes on board looking for Indy & his dad. Indy sees him coming & dresses up as a ticket inspector. Colonel Vogel first finds his father Professor Jones trying to hide his face behind his newspaper. Indy challenges the SS officer to see his ticket, punches him, throws him out of a window & declares to the astonished passengers "No ticket". The passengers, not wishing anything similar happening to them, frantically all hold up their tickets. Two great gags amongst plenty more!. If anyone put me on the spot & asked what is your all-time favourite movie, I would say this one.

    I'd say this is tied with the original "Raiders of the Lost Ark." The dialogue and action mixes really well from beginning to end between both Indiana and his father. The holy grail was a very interesting artifact and made for a very interesting story. The entire movie includes some very famous scenes, including the boat scene, the library scene, and the second half of the movie is spot-on terrific. This is a great action movie and shows the power and desperate desire for immortality. This movie ended on a high note, and it should have ended that way. My advice is you shouldn't watch the fourth movie, though. This is a better ending then it could ever be. Plus, the soundtrack is amazing. Great to watch for fathers day, that's my plan
