  After being captured by Turks during the Crusades, Robin of Locksley and a Moor, Azeem, escape back to England, where Azeem vows to remain until he repays Robin for saving his life. Meanwhile, Robin's father, a nobleman loyal to King Richard the Lionhearted, has been murdered by the brutal Sheriff of Nottingham, who helped install Richard's treacherous brother, Prince John, as king while Richard is overseas fighting the Crusades. When Robin returns home, he vows to avenge his father's death and restore Richard to the throne. Even though Maid Marian, his childhood friend, cannot help him, he escapes to the Forest of Sherwood where he joins a band of exiled villagers and becomes their leader. With their help he attempts to cleanse the land of the evil that the Sheriff has spread.

    Can i sum up this 13 award winning 17 nomination fable story to film in one word yes *Brilliant* With an on form Costner,Morgan Freeman,Alan Rickman and alas lets not forget cameos from Brian Blessed and Sean Connery this story is greatly put together from my youth to the present watching this film never gets old. Which i think the joyous soundtrack has apart to play who can forget Bryan Adams 16 week chart topper. From bed knobs & Broomsticks to Avatar for me Robin Hood will always stand out. So if you want to see a classic or a film to take you back to your youth this is the one and if you asked me to sum it up two words Booming Brilliant.

    I've always been a fan of the character Robin Hood. Thus I try to expose myself to as many adaptions and versions of the character as possible. This movie has a good action, and was thoroughly entertaining. The casting was very well done also with Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, and Christian Slater (whose name is very familiar, but I can't think of any movie he has been in). My only complaint is that Robin Hood (played by Kevin Costner) is from England, but lacks an English accent. Is it just me? I think a convincing English accent could have put this movie over the top. But all in all a very solid film, and love Alan Rickman as the villain. I also did not realize how closely Robin Hood: Men in Tights follows this plot line.

    Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves ***(out of 4) 143 mins/ PG Cast: Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Christian Slater, Alan Rickman, Geraldine McEwan, Michael McShane, Brian Blessed, Michael Wincott, Nick Brimble, Sean Connery Director: Kevin Reynolds Plot: After Robin returns from the Crusades, he trains up a band of merry men to fight against the tyranny of the Sheriff of Nottingham. JJ's Verdict: In Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, we may have awfully cheesy dialogue but with ridiculous amounts of fun and epic swashbuckling that Robin Hood should always be. In the Hollywood version of Robin Hood, we have the traditional story we have always loved with one or two aspects tweaked for good effect - no silly sub-plots like Ridley Scott's 2010 version. Robin returns from the crusades with a Muslim warrior Azeem and finds his father dead, and that the Sheriff of Nottingham is plotting to take the crown from the absent Richard the Lionheart. From here, Robin and Azeem come across a band of men, driven from their homes by Nottingham. Whilst also entertaining Lady Marian, the King's cousin, Robin and Azeem train the local villagers to into an army to fight and rise up against the dictatorship of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Yes, Kevin Costner and Christian Slater's accents stink, but Prince of Thieves is so much fun. From its heroic theme tune and Bryan Adams epic power ballad, to its dazzling, swashbuckling sword waving and total charm, this is probably the finest and most accomplished action/adventure film since Indiana Jones. The ambushes are all brilliantly set-up and choreographed and all the characters are great fun. Kevin Costner brings charm and strong patriotism to his role, and has great chemistry with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Lady Marian. Morgan Freeman is his usual knowledgeable self and Alan Rickman is just brilliantly over-the-top as the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. Christian Slater's character does at first seem like an arrogant idiot but even he grows on you. Geraldine McEwan's fortune-telling witch is the only character who actually doesn't work. There isn't much to its actual plot but Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an absolute (if incredibly cheesy) blast. It has a thrilling action finale and to top it all off, Sean Connery appears at the end as King Richard. Harmless fun!

    Aren't Robin Hood movies supposed to be fun? Robin's band of outlaws are called the Merry Men are they not? There's nothing merry about this movie. This is a bleak and gloomy telling of the Robin Hood story. You could forgive all the gloom if the story was compelling. But it's not. Somehow they managed to make a boring Robin Hood movie. Robin Hood is traditionally such an interesting character you wouldn't think it would be possible to make a telling of his tale so dull. But the story fails to engage and the performance of Robin Hood himself, Kevin Costner, leaves so much to be desired. Costner turns in a flat, lifeless performance. He gets Robin Hood all wrong. Costner may be many things but a swashbuckler is not one of them. Robin Hood is supposed to be an inspiring character, a leader of men. Costner's Robin Hood inspires nothing but yawns. Costner's dud performance would be enough to sink the movie. But the movie has myriad other problems too. The famous love story of Robin Hood and Maid Marian falls completely flat. There is no spark whatsoever between Costner and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio who plays Marian. Robin's Merry Men range from forgettable to, in the case of Will Scarlet, incredibly annoying. Will, played rather terribly by Christian Slater, spends the whole movie acting like a whiny, petulant spoiled brat. The movie eventually gets around to trying to explain his behavior and that effort, like pretty much everything else in the movie, is just stupid. Speaking of stupid, there's a witch who the Sheriff of Nottingham looks to for guidance. Every moment this witch is on the screen is just excruciating. She's the worst character in the movie which is saying a lot because this movie has no shortage of terrible characters. The only person able to inject some life into the movie is Alan Rickman who chews all available scenery as the villainous Sheriff. He has some personality which the rest of the movie, Costner most notably, sorely lacks. This movie has no joy, it's no fun. Who asked for a dark and dreary Robin Hood? The characters are not engaging, the action scenes are uninspiring, the whole thing is just completely lifeless. The Robin Hood of legend is a great hero. That Robin Hood does not appear in this movie.

    I know this came out 22 years ago, but this still my favorite Robin Hood movie. I like this even more that the Russell Crowe movie. I think the casting of the characters was exceptional in that Kevin Costner, Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio were perfect for their roles. I have several favorite parts in this movie but at the top of the list is when Azeem (Morgan Freeman) gives his speech toward the end of the movie asking all the commoners to fight for their freedom. Another favorite scene is when Robin Hood finds out he has a brother, Will Scarlett. And finally, the scene where Robin and the Sheriff fight at the end. Those are my top three favorites. Although I like him, I think the scene at the very end where King Richard "crashes" the wedding between Robin and Marian was an after thought especially when King Richard was played by Sean Connery. If you're going to have a huge actor in such a small roll to make it seem bigger, why choose Sean Connery. Still a great movie! Timeless!

    It's a decent Robin Hood film, even if there are some uneven passages. Freeman wasn't bad but I didn't get what his character should bring to the story. And they didn't know where they should go with Marian; first she was built up as a strong-willed and confident swashbuckling character, then she became a Damsel-in-Distress ... Apart from that, the film was OK; the basic rules for Robin Hood stories (outlaws outwitting the Sheriff's men) are adhered to, and the production values and sets are good. Some people made fun of his accent, but Kevin Costner has a roguish smile fitting the character and I couldn't care less about his accent (maybe a Britishman will disagree).

    Great Kevin Costner who did a formidable interpretation, Morgan Freeman a true professionist, screenplay interesting and fascinating. Really a beautiful movie that shows all of his skills and his hability with an intense story and an adrenalinic envelopment. Is able to be serious and simple, with a lot of characteristic scenes and spectacular events. A narration of a history part well done and complete of every single detail. The dark part doesn't forget to be in a principal role, explaning the situations in a clear way and in a mysterious way too. The twists are a lot, the actors did great, the scenic design is high quality, all the necessary technical works where done with cure and precis passion. Beautiful for real and left sings.

    ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES, a medieval romp of wenches, women, warriors, wild men and the woods, is, taken at face value, an old-fashioned crowd-pleaser of a film. It's a deliberate throwback to the days of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, featuring a tough, swashbuckling hero, a rich tapestry of a storyline bringing together all of the clich&eacute;s, and plenty of action for archery fans to enjoy. It also happens to be packed full of errors, both geographical and factual, and it features some of the cheesiest performances outside of a local pantomime. That's part of the charm. First off, this isn't a film to be taken seriously. From the moment Robin washes up in Dover and announces that he'll be in Nottingham by nightfall, you know that getting the historical details right wasn't the priority of the scriptwriter. The detour to Hadrian's Wall en route is still unintentionally hilarious, and the mumbo-jumbo pagan cult stuff is just as out of place as the presence of the lost boys in Ridley Scott's po-faced take on the myth, ROBIN HOOD. But along the way, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES is a lot of fun. Yes, it's nonsense, but it's entertaining tosh and I for one was thoroughly enjoying myself while I watched it. Okay, so Costner's gruff seriousness grates more than a little, as does the vomit-inducing romantic sub-plot with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's wishy-washy Maid Marian, but at least Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott get into the spirit of things with delightfully over-the-top villainous turns that belong, yes, in a pantomime. Goodness knows what Morgan Freeman thinks he's up to, prowling around in the background as an out-of-place Moor, but he adds entertainment value too  as does Christian Slater's weaselly Will Scarlett. There's action aplenty, along with a touch of viciousness and horror as the Sheriff of Nottingham consults a grisly old witch woman; not the usual kind of stuff you find in family fare. This movie is certainly no masterpiece, but there's something about it that's undeniably charming.

    This awful song rolls across the credits courtesy of mediocre Canadian soft rocker Bryan Adams. It sets the tone for this movie. It's something you'll either love or hate, in my case it's a bit of both. There's a good story here about Robin Hood returning from the Crusades to find his father dead and leading the English people in rebellion against the tyrannical Sheriff but Kevin Costner is so bad in this it's almost lost. The performances of Alan Rickman, Morgan Freeman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio all almost make up for how bad Costner is in this. In a joke from Robin: Men in Tights Cary Elwes' Robin Hood says, "unlike some other Robin Hoods I can speak with an English accent," alluding to the other major problem with Costner's performance-no attempt at sounding English. Instead he sounds like a nondescript American with a bad hair day sporting his post-Crusade mullet. Alan Rickman's scene stealing performance as The Sheriff of Nottingham aided by his devil worshiping foster mother is something to behold. His over-the-top displays of temper and mustache-twirling evil are a lot of fun to watch. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Maid Marian is a strong-willed woman committed to watching after an English people seemingly abandoned by Richard the Lionheart (which it was) and men like Robin Hood who rushed off to the Crusades in religious zeal or the pursuit of riches. Morgan Freeman is Azeem, Robin's solemn Moorish companion, who acts as an unwanted protector and straight man. Surprisingly there's no mention of Prince John, Richard I's brother, who is often depicted in Robin Hood adaptations as working with the Sheriff and Sir Guy of Gisbon to usurp the throne.

    Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves  Action and adventure with the mythical figure

    Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an excellent adventure, with a bit of silliness, some romance, a few laughs, and plenty action. Kevin Costner is at his best. It might not be Morgan Freeman's greatest role, but he plays it admirably well, with a good accent, a nice straight-face funny attitude, intelligent, and full of vigor. He represent a strong black male figure anyone can admire. Alan Rickman is excellent as the evil and silly sheriff. As his despicable sidekick, Michael Wincott is just perfect. Christian Slater was good, but disappointing in his dramatic scene. The rest of the cast was on target. Great photography, nice score, good editing, interesting story. beautiful sets, nice costumes. It has everything to make for a great evening. Now for the little negative bits. Beyond the fact that Robin Hood is a mythical figure, the movie is in no way historically accurate, and the same can be said of the hair styles. Don't take it seriously, and you'll enjoy it.

    This awful song rolls across the credits courtesy of mediocre Canadian soft rocker Bryan Adams. It sets the tone for this movie. It's something you'll either love or hate, in my case it's a bit of both. There's a good story here about Robin Hood returning from the Crusades to find his father dead and leading the English people in rebellion against the tyrannical Sheriff but Kevin Costner is so bad in this it's almost lost. The performances of Alan Rickman, Morgan Freeman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio all almost make up for how bad Costner is in this. In a joke from Robin: Men in Tights Cary Elwes' Robin Hood says, "unlike some other Robin Hoods I can speak with an English accent," alluding to the other major problem with Costner's performance-no attempt at sounding English. Instead he sounds like a nondescript American with a bad hair day sporting his post-Crusade mullet. Alan Rickman's scene stealing performance as The Sheriff of Nottingham aided by his devil worshiping foster mother is something to behold. His over-the-top displays of temper and mustache-twirling evil are a lot of fun to watch. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Maid Marian is a strong-willed woman committed to watching after an English people seemingly abandoned by Richard the Lionheart (which it was) and men like Robin Hood who rushed off to the Crusades in religious zeal or the pursuit of riches. Morgan Freeman is Azeem, Robin's solemn Moorish companion, who acts as an unwanted protector and straight man. Surprisingly there's no mention of Prince John, Richard I's brother, who is often depicted in Robin Hood adaptations as working with the Sheriff and Sir Guy of Gisbon to usurp the throne.

    Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an excellent adventure, with a bit of silliness, some romance, a few laughs, and plenty action. Kevin Costner is at his best. It might not be Morgan Freeman's greatest role, but he plays it admirably well, with a good accent, a nice straight-face funny attitude, intelligent, and full of vigor. He represent a strong black male figure anyone can admire. Alan Rickman is excellent as the evil and silly sheriff. As his despicable sidekick, Michael Wincott is just perfect. Christian Slater was good, but disappointing in his dramatic scene. The rest of the cast was on target. Great photography, nice score, good editing, interesting story. beautiful sets, nice costumes. It has everything to make for a great evening. Now for the little negative bits. Beyond the fact that Robin Hood is a mythical figure, the movie is in no way historically accurate, and the same can be said of the hair styles. Don't take it seriously, and you'll enjoy it.

    Can i sum up this 13 award winning 17 nomination fable story to film in one word yes *Brilliant* With an on form Costner,Morgan Freeman,Alan Rickman and alas lets not forget cameos from Brian Blessed and Sean Connery this story is greatly put together from my youth to the present watching this film never gets old. Which i think the joyous soundtrack has apart to play who can forget Bryan Adams 16 week chart topper. From bed knobs & Broomsticks to Avatar for me Robin Hood will always stand out. So if you want to see a classic or a film to take you back to your youth this is the one and if you asked me to sum it up two words Booming Brilliant.

    I've always been a fan of the character Robin Hood. Thus I try to expose myself to as many adaptions and versions of the character as possible. This movie has a good action, and was thoroughly entertaining. The casting was very well done also with Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, and Christian Slater (whose name is very familiar, but I can't think of any movie he has been in). My only complaint is that Robin Hood (played by Kevin Costner) is from England, but lacks an English accent. Is it just me? I think a convincing English accent could have put this movie over the top. But all in all a very solid film, and love Alan Rickman as the villain. I also did not realize how closely Robin Hood: Men in Tights follows this plot line.

    Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves ***(out of 4) 143 mins/ PG Cast: Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Christian Slater, Alan Rickman, Geraldine McEwan, Michael McShane, Brian Blessed, Michael Wincott, Nick Brimble, Sean Connery Director: Kevin Reynolds Plot: After Robin returns from the Crusades, he trains up a band of merry men to fight against the tyranny of the Sheriff of Nottingham. JJ's Verdict: In Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, we may have awfully cheesy dialogue but with ridiculous amounts of fun and epic swashbuckling that Robin Hood should always be. In the Hollywood version of Robin Hood, we have the traditional story we have always loved with one or two aspects tweaked for good effect - no silly sub-plots like Ridley Scott's 2010 version. Robin returns from the crusades with a Muslim warrior Azeem and finds his father dead, and that the Sheriff of Nottingham is plotting to take the crown from the absent Richard the Lionheart. From here, Robin and Azeem come across a band of men, driven from their homes by Nottingham. Whilst also entertaining Lady Marian, the King's cousin, Robin and Azeem train the local villagers to into an army to fight and rise up against the dictatorship of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Yes, Kevin Costner and Christian Slater's accents stink, but Prince of Thieves is so much fun. From its heroic theme tune and Bryan Adams epic power ballad, to its dazzling, swashbuckling sword waving and total charm, this is probably the finest and most accomplished action/adventure film since Indiana Jones. The ambushes are all brilliantly set-up and choreographed and all the characters are great fun. Kevin Costner brings charm and strong patriotism to his role, and has great chemistry with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Lady Marian. Morgan Freeman is his usual knowledgeable self and Alan Rickman is just brilliantly over-the-top as the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. Christian Slater's character does at first seem like an arrogant idiot but even he grows on you. Geraldine McEwan's fortune-telling witch is the only character who actually doesn't work. There isn't much to its actual plot but Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an absolute (if incredibly cheesy) blast. It has a thrilling action finale and to top it all off, Sean Connery appears at the end as King Richard. Harmless fun!

    Aren't Robin Hood movies supposed to be fun? Robin's band of outlaws are called the Merry Men are they not? There's nothing merry about this movie. This is a bleak and gloomy telling of the Robin Hood story. You could forgive all the gloom if the story was compelling. But it's not. Somehow they managed to make a boring Robin Hood movie. Robin Hood is traditionally such an interesting character you wouldn't think it would be possible to make a telling of his tale so dull. But the story fails to engage and the performance of Robin Hood himself, Kevin Costner, leaves so much to be desired. Costner turns in a flat, lifeless performance. He gets Robin Hood all wrong. Costner may be many things but a swashbuckler is not one of them. Robin Hood is supposed to be an inspiring character, a leader of men. Costner's Robin Hood inspires nothing but yawns. Costner's dud performance would be enough to sink the movie. But the movie has myriad other problems too. The famous love story of Robin Hood and Maid Marian falls completely flat. There is no spark whatsoever between Costner and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio who plays Marian. Robin's Merry Men range from forgettable to, in the case of Will Scarlet, incredibly annoying. Will, played rather terribly by Christian Slater, spends the whole movie acting like a whiny, petulant spoiled brat. The movie eventually gets around to trying to explain his behavior and that effort, like pretty much everything else in the movie, is just stupid. Speaking of stupid, there's a witch who the Sheriff of Nottingham looks to for guidance. Every moment this witch is on the screen is just excruciating. She's the worst character in the movie which is saying a lot because this movie has no shortage of terrible characters. The only person able to inject some life into the movie is Alan Rickman who chews all available scenery as the villainous Sheriff. He has some personality which the rest of the movie, Costner most notably, sorely lacks. This movie has no joy, it's no fun. Who asked for a dark and dreary Robin Hood? The characters are not engaging, the action scenes are uninspiring, the whole thing is just completely lifeless. The Robin Hood of legend is a great hero. That Robin Hood does not appear in this movie.

    I know this came out 22 years ago, but this still my favorite Robin Hood movie. I like this even more that the Russell Crowe movie. I think the casting of the characters was exceptional in that Kevin Costner, Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio were perfect for their roles. I have several favorite parts in this movie but at the top of the list is when Azeem (Morgan Freeman) gives his speech toward the end of the movie asking all the commoners to fight for their freedom. Another favorite scene is when Robin Hood finds out he has a brother, Will Scarlett. And finally, the scene where Robin and the Sheriff fight at the end. Those are my top three favorites. Although I like him, I think the scene at the very end where King Richard "crashes" the wedding between Robin and Marian was an after thought especially when King Richard was played by Sean Connery. If you're going to have a huge actor in such a small roll to make it seem bigger, why choose Sean Connery. Still a great movie! Timeless!

    It's a decent Robin Hood film, even if there are some uneven passages. Freeman wasn't bad but I didn't get what his character should bring to the story. And they didn't know where they should go with Marian; first she was built up as a strong-willed and confident swashbuckling character, then she became a Damsel-in-Distress ... Apart from that, the film was OK; the basic rules for Robin Hood stories (outlaws outwitting the Sheriff's men) are adhered to, and the production values and sets are good. Some people made fun of his accent, but Kevin Costner has a roguish smile fitting the character and I couldn't care less about his accent (maybe a Britishman will disagree).

    Great Kevin Costner who did a formidable interpretation, Morgan Freeman a true professionist, screenplay interesting and fascinating. Really a beautiful movie that shows all of his skills and his hability with an intense story and an adrenalinic envelopment. Is able to be serious and simple, with a lot of characteristic scenes and spectacular events. A narration of a history part well done and complete of every single detail. The dark part doesn't forget to be in a principal role, explaning the situations in a clear way and in a mysterious way too. The twists are a lot, the actors did great, the scenic design is high quality, all the necessary technical works where done with cure and precis passion. Beautiful for real and left sings.

    ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES, a medieval romp of wenches, women, warriors, wild men and the woods, is, taken at face value, an old-fashioned crowd-pleaser of a film. It's a deliberate throwback to the days of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, featuring a tough, swashbuckling hero, a rich tapestry of a storyline bringing together all of the clich&eacute;s, and plenty of action for archery fans to enjoy. It also happens to be packed full of errors, both geographical and factual, and it features some of the cheesiest performances outside of a local pantomime. That's part of the charm. First off, this isn't a film to be taken seriously. From the moment Robin washes up in Dover and announces that he'll be in Nottingham by nightfall, you know that getting the historical details right wasn't the priority of the scriptwriter. The detour to Hadrian's Wall en route is still unintentionally hilarious, and the mumbo-jumbo pagan cult stuff is just as out of place as the presence of the lost boys in Ridley Scott's po-faced take on the myth, ROBIN HOOD. But along the way, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES is a lot of fun. Yes, it's nonsense, but it's entertaining tosh and I for one was thoroughly enjoying myself while I watched it. Okay, so Costner's gruff seriousness grates more than a little, as does the vomit-inducing romantic sub-plot with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's wishy-washy Maid Marian, but at least Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott get into the spirit of things with delightfully over-the-top villainous turns that belong, yes, in a pantomime. Goodness knows what Morgan Freeman thinks he's up to, prowling around in the background as an out-of-place Moor, but he adds entertainment value too  as does Christian Slater's weaselly Will Scarlett. There's action aplenty, along with a touch of viciousness and horror as the Sheriff of Nottingham consults a grisly old witch woman; not the usual kind of stuff you find in family fare. This movie is certainly no masterpiece, but there's something about it that's undeniably charming.

There's action aplenty, along with a touch of viciousness and horror as the Sheriff of Nottingham consults a grisly old witch woman; not the usual kind of stuff you find in family fare. This movie is certainly no masterpiece, but there's something about it that's undeniably charming.

    This awful song rolls across the credits courtesy of mediocre Canadian soft rocker Bryan Adams. It sets the tone for this movie. It's something you'll either love or hate, in my case it's a bit of both. There's a good story here about Robin Hood returning from the Crusades to find his father dead and leading the English people in rebellion against the tyrannical Sheriff but Kevin Costner is so bad in this it's almost lost. The performances of Alan Rickman, Morgan Freeman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio all almost make up for how bad Costner is in this. In a joke from Robin: Men in Tights Cary Elwes' Robin Hood says, "unlike some other Robin Hoods I can speak with an English accent," alluding to the other major problem with Costner's performance-no attempt at sounding English. Instead he sounds like a nondescript American with a bad hair day sporting his post-Crusade mullet. Alan Rickman's scene stealing performance as The Sheriff of Nottingham aided by his devil worshiping foster mother is something to behold. His over-the-top displays of temper and mustache-twirling evil are a lot of fun to watch. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Maid Marian is a strong-willed woman committed to watching after an English people seemingly abandoned by Richard the Lionheart (which it was) and men like Robin Hood who rushed off to the Crusades in religious zeal or the pursuit of riches. Morgan Freeman is Azeem, Robin's solemn Moorish companion, who acts as an unwanted protector and straight man. Surprisingly there's no mention of Prince John, Richard I's brother, who is often depicted in Robin Hood adaptations as working with the Sheriff and Sir Guy of Gisbon to usurp the throne.

    Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an excellent adventure, with a bit of silliness, some romance, a few laughs, and plenty action. Kevin Costner is at his best. It might not be Morgan Freeman's greatest role, but he plays it admirably well, with a good accent, a nice straight-face funny attitude, intelligent, and full of vigor. He represent a strong black male figure anyone can admire. Alan Rickman is excellent as the evil and silly sheriff. As his despicable sidekick, Michael Wincott is just perfect. Christian Slater was good, but disappointing in his dramatic scene. The rest of the cast was on target. Great photography, nice score, good editing, interesting story. beautiful sets, nice costumes. It has everything to make for a great evening. Now for the little negative bits. Beyond the fact that Robin Hood is a mythical figure, the movie is in no way historically accurate, and the same can be said of the hair styles. Don't take it seriously, and you'll enjoy it.

    Can i sum up this 13 award winning 17 nomination fable story to film in one word yes *Brilliant* With an on form Costner,Morgan Freeman,Alan Rickman and alas lets not forget cameos from Brian Blessed and Sean Connery this story is greatly put together from my youth to the present watching this film never gets old. Which i think the joyous soundtrack has apart to play who can forget Bryan Adams 16 week chart topper. From bed knobs & Broomsticks to Avatar for me Robin Hood will always stand out. So if you want to see a classic or a film to take you back to your youth this is the one and if you asked me to sum it up two words Booming Brilliant.

    I've always been a fan of the character Robin Hood. Thus I try to expose myself to as many adaptions and versions of the character as possible. This movie has a good action, and was thoroughly entertaining. The casting was very well done also with Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, and Christian Slater (whose name is very familiar, but I can't think of any movie he has been in). My only complaint is that Robin Hood (played by Kevin Costner) is from England, but lacks an English accent. Is it just me? I think a convincing English accent could have put this movie over the top. But all in all a very solid film, and love Alan Rickman as the villain. I also did not realize how closely Robin Hood: Men in Tights follows this plot line.

    Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves ***(out of 4) 143 mins/ PG Cast: Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Christian Slater, Alan Rickman, Geraldine McEwan, Michael McShane, Brian Blessed, Michael Wincott, Nick Brimble, Sean Connery Director: Kevin Reynolds Plot: After Robin returns from the Crusades, he trains up a band of merry men to fight against the tyranny of the Sheriff of Nottingham. JJ's Verdict: In Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, we may have awfully cheesy dialogue but with ridiculous amounts of fun and epic swashbuckling that Robin Hood should always be. In the Hollywood version of Robin Hood, we have the traditional story we have always loved with one or two aspects tweaked for good effect - no silly sub-plots like Ridley Scott's 2010 version. Robin returns from the crusades with a Muslim warrior Azeem and finds his father dead, and that the Sheriff of Nottingham is plotting to take the crown from the absent Richard the Lionheart. From here, Robin and Azeem come across a band of men, driven from their homes by Nottingham. Whilst also entertaining Lady Marian, the King's cousin, Robin and Azeem train the local villagers to into an army to fight and rise up against the dictatorship of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Yes, Kevin Costner and Christian Slater's accents stink, but Prince of Thieves is so much fun. From its heroic theme tune and Bryan Adams epic power ballad, to its dazzling, swashbuckling sword waving and total charm, this is probably the finest and most accomplished action/adventure film since Indiana Jones. The ambushes are all brilliantly set-up and choreographed and all the characters are great fun. Kevin Costner brings charm and strong patriotism to his role, and has great chemistry with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Lady Marian. Morgan Freeman is his usual knowledgeable self and Alan Rickman is just brilliantly over-the-top as the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. Christian Slater's character does at first seem like an arrogant idiot but even he grows on you. Geraldine McEwan's fortune-telling witch is the only character who actually doesn't work. There isn't much to its actual plot but Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an absolute (if incredibly cheesy) blast. It has a thrilling action finale and to top it all off, Sean Connery appears at the end as King Richard. Harmless fun!

    Aren't Robin Hood movies supposed to be fun? Robin's band of outlaws are called the Merry Men are they not? There's nothing merry about this movie. This is a bleak and gloomy telling of the Robin Hood story. You could forgive all the gloom if the story was compelling. But it's not. Somehow they managed to make a boring Robin Hood movie. Robin Hood is traditionally such an interesting character you wouldn't think it would be possible to make a telling of his tale so dull. But the story fails to engage and the performance of Robin Hood himself, Kevin Costner, leaves so much to be desired. Costner turns in a flat, lifeless performance. He gets Robin Hood all wrong. Costner may be many things but a swashbuckler is not one of them. Robin Hood is supposed to be an inspiring character, a leader of men. Costner's Robin Hood inspires nothing but yawns. Costner's dud performance would be enough to sink the movie. But the movie has myriad other problems too. The famous love story of Robin Hood and Maid Marian falls completely flat. There is no spark whatsoever between Costner and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio who plays Marian. Robin's Merry Men range from forgettable to, in the case of Will Scarlet, incredibly annoying. Will, played rather terribly by Christian Slater, spends the whole movie acting like a whiny, petulant spoiled brat. The movie eventually gets around to trying to explain his behavior and that effort, like pretty much everything else in the movie, is just stupid. Speaking of stupid, there's a witch who the Sheriff of Nottingham looks to for guidance. Every moment this witch is on the screen is just excruciating. She's the worst character in the movie which is saying a lot because this movie has no shortage of terrible characters. The only person able to inject some life into the movie is Alan Rickman who chews all available scenery as the villainous Sheriff. He has some personality which the rest of the movie, Costner most notably, sorely lacks. This movie has no joy, it's no fun. Who asked for a dark and dreary Robin Hood? The characters are not engaging, the action scenes are uninspiring, the whole thing is just completely lifeless. The Robin Hood of legend is a great hero. That Robin Hood does not appear in this movie.

    I know this came out 22 years ago, but this still my favorite Robin Hood movie. I like this even more that the Russell Crowe movie. I think the casting of the characters was exceptional in that Kevin Costner, Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio were perfect for their roles. I have several favorite parts in this movie but at the top of the list is when Azeem (Morgan Freeman) gives his speech toward the end of the movie asking all the commoners to fight for their freedom. Another favorite scene is when Robin Hood finds out he has a brother, Will Scarlett. And finally, the scene where Robin and the Sheriff fight at the end. Those are my top three favorites. Although I like him, I think the scene at the very end where King Richard "crashes" the wedding between Robin and Marian was an after thought especially when King Richard was played by Sean Connery. If you're going to have a huge actor in such a small roll to make it seem bigger, why choose Sean Connery. Still a great movie! Timeless!

    It's a decent Robin Hood film, even if there are some uneven passages. Freeman wasn't bad but I didn't get what his character should bring to the story. And they didn't know where they should go with Marian; first she was built up as a strong-willed and confident swashbuckling character, then she became a Damsel-in-Distress ... Apart from that, the film was OK; the basic rules for Robin Hood stories (outlaws outwitting the Sheriff's men) are adhered to, and the production values and sets are good. Some people made fun of his accent, but Kevin Costner has a roguish smile fitting the character and I couldn't care less about his accent (maybe a Britishman will disagree).

    Great Kevin Costner who did a formidable interpretation, Morgan Freeman a true professionist, screenplay interesting and fascinating. Really a beautiful movie that shows all of his skills and his hability with an intense story and an adrenalinic envelopment. Is able to be serious and simple, with a lot of characteristic scenes and spectacular events. A narration of a history part well done and complete of every single detail. The dark part doesn't forget to be in a principal role, explaning the situations in a clear way and in a mysterious way too. The twists are a lot, the actors did great, the scenic design is high quality, all the necessary technical works where done with cure and precis passion. Beautiful for real and left sings.

    ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES, a medieval romp of wenches, women, warriors, wild men and the woods, is, taken at face value, an old-fashioned crowd-pleaser of a film. It's a deliberate throwback to the days of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, featuring a tough, swashbuckling hero, a rich tapestry of a storyline bringing together all of the clich&eacute;s, and plenty of action for archery fans to enjoy. It also happens to be packed full of errors, both geographical and factual, and it features some of the cheesiest performances outside of a local pantomime. That's part of the charm. First off, this isn't a film to be taken seriously. From the moment Robin washes up in Dover and announces that he'll be in Nottingham by nightfall, you know that getting the historical details right wasn't the priority of the scriptwriter. The detour to Hadrian's Wall en route is still unintentionally hilarious, and the mumbo-jumbo pagan cult stuff is just as out of place as the presence of the lost boys in Ridley Scott's po-faced take on the myth, ROBIN HOOD. But along the way, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES is a lot of fun. Yes, it's nonsense, but it's entertaining tosh and I for one was thoroughly enjoying myself while I watched it. Okay, so Costner's gruff seriousness grates more than a little, as does the vomit-inducing romantic sub-plot with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's wishy-washy Maid Marian, but at least Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott get into the spirit of things with delightfully over-the-top villainous turns that belong, yes, in a pantomime. Goodness knows what Morgan Freeman thinks he's up to, prowling around in the background as an out-of-place Moor, but he adds entertainment value too  as does Christian Slater's weaselly Will Scarlett. There's action aplenty, along with a touch of viciousness and horror as the Sheriff of Nottingham consults a grisly old witch woman; not the usual kind of stuff you find in family fare.

The detour to Hadrian's Wall en route is still unintentionally hilarious, and the mumbo-jumbo pagan cult stuff is just as out of place as the presence of the lost boys in Ridley Scott's po-faced take on the myth, ROBIN HOOD. But along the way, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES is a lot of fun. Yes, it's nonsense, but it's entertaining tosh and I for one was thoroughly enjoying myself while I watched it. Okay, so Costner's gruff seriousness grates more than a little, as does the vomit-inducing romantic sub-plot with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's wishy-washy Maid Marian, but at least Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott get into the spirit of things with delightfully over-the-top villainous turns that belong, yes, in a pantomime. Goodness knows what Morgan Freeman thinks he's up to, prowling around in the background as an out-of-place Moor, but he adds entertainment value too  as does Christian Slater's weaselly Will Scarlett. There's action aplenty, along with a touch of viciousness and horror as the Sheriff of Nottingham consults a grisly old witch woman; not the usual kind of stuff you find in family fare. This movie is certainly no masterpiece, but there's something about it that's undeniably charming.

    This awful song rolls across the credits courtesy of mediocre Canadian soft rocker Bryan Adams. It sets the tone for this movie. It's something you'll either love or hate, in my case it's a bit of both. There's a good story here about Robin Hood returning from the Crusades to find his father dead and leading the English people in rebellion against the tyrannical Sheriff but Kevin Costner is so bad in this it's almost lost. The performances of Alan Rickman, Morgan Freeman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio all almost make up for how bad Costner is in this. In a joke from Robin: Men in Tights Cary Elwes' Robin Hood says, "unlike some other Robin Hoods I can speak with an English accent," alluding to the other major problem with Costner's performance-no attempt at sounding English. Instead he sounds like a nondescript American with a bad hair day sporting his post-Crusade mullet. Alan Rickman's scene stealing performance as The Sheriff of Nottingham aided by his devil worshiping foster mother is something to behold. His over-the-top displays of temper and mustache-twirling evil are a lot of fun to watch. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Maid Marian is a strong-willed woman committed to watching after an English people seemingly abandoned by Richard the Lionheart (which it was) and men like Robin Hood who rushed off to the Crusades in religious zeal or the pursuit of riches. Morgan Freeman is Azeem, Robin's solemn Moorish companion, who acts as an unwanted protector and straight man. Surprisingly there's no mention of Prince John, Richard I's brother, who is often depicted in Robin Hood adaptations as working with the Sheriff and Sir Guy of Gisbon to usurp the throne.

    Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an excellent adventure, with a bit of silliness, some romance, a few laughs, and plenty action. Kevin Costner is at his best. It might not be Morgan Freeman's greatest role, but he plays it admirably well, with a good accent, a nice straight-face funny attitude, intelligent, and full of vigor. He represent a strong black male figure anyone can admire. Alan Rickman is excellent as the evil and silly sheriff. As his despicable sidekick, Michael Wincott is just perfect. Christian Slater was good, but disappointing in his dramatic scene. The rest of the cast was on target. Great photography, nice score, good editing, interesting story. beautiful sets, nice costumes. It has everything to make for a great evening. Now for the little negative bits. Beyond the fact that Robin Hood is a mythical figure, the movie is in no way historically accurate, and the same can be said of the hair styles. Don't take it seriously, and you'll enjoy it.

    Can i sum up this 13 award winning 17 nomination fable story to film in one word yes *Brilliant* With an on form Costner,Morgan Freeman,Alan Rickman and alas lets not forget cameos from Brian Blessed and Sean Connery this story is greatly put together from my youth to the present watching this film never gets old. Which i think the joyous soundtrack has apart to play who can forget Bryan Adams 16 week chart topper. From bed knobs & Broomsticks to Avatar for me Robin Hood will always stand out. So if you want to see a classic or a film to take you back to your youth this is the one and if you asked me to sum it up two words Booming Brilliant.

    I've always been a fan of the character Robin Hood. Thus I try to expose myself to as many adaptions and versions of the character as possible. This movie has a good action, and was thoroughly entertaining. The casting was very well done also with Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, and Christian Slater (whose name is very familiar, but I can't think of any movie he has been in). My only complaint is that Robin Hood (played by Kevin Costner) is from England, but lacks an English accent. Is it just me? I think a convincing English accent could have put this movie over the top. But all in all a very solid film, and love Alan Rickman as the villain. I also did not realize how closely Robin Hood: Men in Tights follows this plot line.

    Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves ***(out of 4) 143 mins/ PG Cast: Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Christian Slater, Alan Rickman, Geraldine McEwan, Michael McShane, Brian Blessed, Michael Wincott, Nick Brimble, Sean Connery Director: Kevin Reynolds Plot: After Robin returns from the Crusades, he trains up a band of merry men to fight against the tyranny of the Sheriff of Nottingham. JJ's Verdict: In Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, we may have awfully cheesy dialogue but with ridiculous amounts of fun and epic swashbuckling that Robin Hood should always be. In the Hollywood version of Robin Hood, we have the traditional story we have always loved with one or two aspects tweaked for good effect - no silly sub-plots like Ridley Scott's 2010 version. Robin returns from the crusades with a Muslim warrior Azeem and finds his father dead, and that the Sheriff of Nottingham is plotting to take the crown from the absent Richard the Lionheart. From here, Robin and Azeem come across a band of men, driven from their homes by Nottingham. Whilst also entertaining Lady Marian, the King's cousin, Robin and Azeem train the local villagers to into an army to fight and rise up against the dictatorship of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Yes, Kevin Costner and Christian Slater's accents stink, but Prince of Thieves is so much fun. From its heroic theme tune and Bryan Adams epic power ballad, to its dazzling, swashbuckling sword waving and total charm, this is probably the finest and most accomplished action/adventure film since Indiana Jones. The ambushes are all brilliantly set-up and choreographed and all the characters are great fun. Kevin Costner brings charm and strong patriotism to his role, and has great chemistry with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Lady Marian. Morgan Freeman is his usual knowledgeable self and Alan Rickman is just brilliantly over-the-top as the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. Christian Slater's character does at first seem like an arrogant idiot but even he grows on you. Geraldine McEwan's fortune-telling witch is the only character who actually doesn't work. There isn't much to its actual plot but Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an absolute (if incredibly cheesy) blast. It has a thrilling action finale and to top it all off, Sean Connery appears at the end as King Richard. Harmless fun!

    Aren't Robin Hood movies supposed to be fun? Robin's band of outlaws are called the Merry Men are they not? There's nothing merry about this movie. This is a bleak and gloomy telling of the Robin Hood story. You could forgive all the gloom if the story was compelling. But it's not. Somehow they managed to make a boring Robin Hood movie. Robin Hood is traditionally such an interesting character you wouldn't think it would be possible to make a telling of his tale so dull. But the story fails to engage and the performance of Robin Hood himself, Kevin Costner, leaves so much to be desired. Costner turns in a flat, lifeless performance. He gets Robin Hood all wrong. Costner may be many things but a swashbuckler is not one of them. Robin Hood is supposed to be an inspiring character, a leader of men. Costner's Robin Hood inspires nothing but yawns. Costner's dud performance would be enough to sink the movie. But the movie has myriad other problems too. The famous love story of Robin Hood and Maid Marian falls completely flat. There is no spark whatsoever between Costner and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio who plays Marian. Robin's Merry Men range from forgettable to, in the case of Will Scarlet, incredibly annoying. Will, played rather terribly by Christian Slater, spends the whole movie acting like a whiny, petulant spoiled brat. The movie eventually gets around to trying to explain his behavior and that effort, like pretty much everything else in the movie, is just stupid. Speaking of stupid, there's a witch who the Sheriff of Nottingham looks to for guidance. Every moment this witch is on the screen is just excruciating. She's the worst character in the movie which is saying a lot because this movie has no shortage of terrible characters. The only person able to inject some life into the movie is Alan Rickman who chews all available scenery as the villainous Sheriff. He has some personality which the rest of the movie, Costner most notably, sorely lacks. This movie has no joy, it's no fun. Who asked for a dark and dreary Robin Hood? The characters are not engaging, the action scenes are uninspiring, the whole thing is just completely lifeless. The Robin Hood of legend is a great hero. That Robin Hood does not appear in this movie.

    I know this came out 22 years ago, but this still my favorite Robin Hood movie. I like this even more that the Russell Crowe movie. I think the casting of the characters was exceptional in that Kevin Costner, Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio were perfect for their roles. I have several favorite parts in this movie but at the top of the list is when Azeem (Morgan Freeman) gives his speech toward the end of the movie asking all the commoners to fight for their freedom. Another favorite scene is when Robin Hood finds out he has a brother, Will Scarlett. And finally, the scene where Robin and the Sheriff fight at the end. Those are my top three favorites. Although I like him, I think the scene at the very end where King Richard "crashes" the wedding between Robin and Marian was an after thought especially when King Richard was played by Sean Connery. If you're going to have a huge actor in such a small roll to make it seem bigger, why choose Sean Connery. Still a great movie! Timeless!

    It's a decent Robin Hood film, even if there are some uneven passages. Freeman wasn't bad but I didn't get what his character should bring to the story. And they didn't know where they should go with Marian; first she was built up as a strong-willed and confident swashbuckling character, then she became a Damsel-in-Distress ... Apart from that, the film was OK; the basic rules for Robin Hood stories (outlaws outwitting the Sheriff's men) are adhered to, and the production values and sets are good. Some people made fun of his accent, but Kevin Costner has a roguish smile fitting the character and I couldn't care less about his accent (maybe a Britishman will disagree).

    Great Kevin Costner who did a formidable interpretation, Morgan Freeman a true professionist, screenplay interesting and fascinating. Really a beautiful movie that shows all of his skills and his hability with an intense story and an adrenalinic envelopment. Is able to be serious and simple, with a lot of characteristic scenes and spectacular events. A narration of a history part well done and complete of every single detail. The dark part doesn't forget to be in a principal role, explaning the situations in a clear way and in a mysterious way too. The twists are a lot, the actors did great, the scenic design is high quality, all the necessary technical works where done with cure and precis passion. Beautiful for real and left sings.

    ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES, a medieval romp of wenches, women, warriors, wild men and the woods, is, taken at face value, an old-fashioned crowd-pleaser of a film. It's a deliberate throwback to the days of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, featuring a tough, swashbuckling hero, a rich tapestry of a storyline bringing together all of the clich&eacute;s, and plenty of action for archery fans to enjoy. It also happens to be packed full of errors, both geographical and factual, and it features some of the cheesiest performances outside of a local pantomime. That's part of the charm. First off, this isn't a film to be taken seriously. From the moment Robin washes up in Dover and announces that he'll be in Nottingham by nightfall, you know that getting the historical details right wasn't the priority of the scriptwriter. The detour to Hadrian's Wall en route is still unintentionally hilarious, and the mumbo-jumbo pagan cult stuff is just as out of place as the presence of the lost boys in Ridley Scott's po-faced take on the myth, ROBIN HOOD. But along the way, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES is a lot of fun. Yes, it's nonsense, but it's entertaining tosh and I for one was thoroughly enjoying myself while I watched it. Okay, so Costner's gruff seriousness grates more than a little, as does the vomit-inducing romantic sub-plot with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's wishy-washy Maid Marian, but at least Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott get into the spirit of things with delightfully over-the-top villainous turns that belong, yes, in a pantomime. Goodness knows what Morgan Freeman thinks he's up to, prowling around in the background as an out-of-place Moor, but he adds entertainment value too  as does Christian Slater's weaselly Will Scarlett.

It's a deliberate throwback to the days of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, featuring a tough, swashbuckling hero, a rich tapestry of a storyline bringing together all of the clich&eacute;s, and plenty of action for archery fans to enjoy. It also happens to be packed full of errors, both geographical and factual, and it features some of the cheesiest performances outside of a local pantomime. That's part of the charm. First off, this isn't a film to be taken seriously. From the moment Robin washes up in Dover and announces that he'll be in Nottingham by nightfall, you know that getting the historical details right wasn't the priority of the scriptwriter. The detour to Hadrian's Wall en route is still unintentionally hilarious, and the mumbo-jumbo pagan cult stuff is just as out of place as the presence of the lost boys in Ridley Scott's po-faced take on the myth, ROBIN HOOD. But along the way, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES is a lot of fun. Yes, it's nonsense, but it's entertaining tosh and I for one was thoroughly enjoying myself while I watched it. Okay, so Costner's gruff seriousness grates more than a little, as does the vomit-inducing romantic sub-plot with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's wishy-washy Maid Marian, but at least Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott get into the spirit of things with delightfully over-the-top villainous turns that belong, yes, in a pantomime. Goodness knows what Morgan Freeman thinks he's up to, prowling around in the background as an out-of-place Moor, but he adds entertainment value too  as does Christian Slater's weaselly Will Scarlett. There's action aplenty, along with a touch of viciousness and horror as the Sheriff of Nottingham consults a grisly old witch woman; not the usual kind of stuff you find in family fare. This movie is certainly no masterpiece, but there's something about it that's undeniably charming.

    This awful song rolls across the credits courtesy of mediocre Canadian soft rocker Bryan Adams. It sets the tone for this movie. It's something you'll either love or hate, in my case it's a bit of both. There's a good story here about Robin Hood returning from the Crusades to find his father dead and leading the English people in rebellion against the tyrannical Sheriff but Kevin Costner is so bad in this it's almost lost. The performances of Alan Rickman, Morgan Freeman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio all almost make up for how bad Costner is in this. In a joke from Robin: Men in Tights Cary Elwes' Robin Hood says, "unlike some other Robin Hoods I can speak with an English accent," alluding to the other major problem with Costner's performance-no attempt at sounding English. Instead he sounds like a nondescript American with a bad hair day sporting his post-Crusade mullet. Alan Rickman's scene stealing performance as The Sheriff of Nottingham aided by his devil worshiping foster mother is something to behold. His over-the-top displays of temper and mustache-twirling evil are a lot of fun to watch. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Maid Marian is a strong-willed woman committed to watching after an English people seemingly abandoned by Richard the Lionheart (which it was) and men like Robin Hood who rushed off to the Crusades in religious zeal or the pursuit of riches. Morgan Freeman is Azeem, Robin's solemn Moorish companion, who acts as an unwanted protector and straight man. Surprisingly there's no mention of Prince John, Richard I's brother, who is often depicted in Robin Hood adaptations as working with the Sheriff and Sir Guy of Gisbon to usurp the throne.

    Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an excellent adventure, with a bit of silliness, some romance, a few laughs, and plenty action. Kevin Costner is at his best. It might not be Morgan Freeman's greatest role, but he plays it admirably well, with a good accent, a nice straight-face funny attitude, intelligent, and full of vigor. He represent a strong black male figure anyone can admire. Alan Rickman is excellent as the evil and silly sheriff. As his despicable sidekick, Michael Wincott is just perfect. Christian Slater was good, but disappointing in his dramatic scene. The rest of the cast was on target. Great photography, nice score, good editing, interesting story. beautiful sets, nice costumes. It has everything to make for a great evening. Now for the little negative bits. Beyond the fact that Robin Hood is a mythical figure, the movie is in no way historically accurate, and the same can be said of the hair styles. Don't take it seriously, and you'll enjoy it.

    Can i sum up this 13 award winning 17 nomination fable story to film in one word yes *Brilliant* With an on form Costner,Morgan Freeman,Alan Rickman and alas lets not forget cameos from Brian Blessed and Sean Connery this story is greatly put together from my youth to the present watching this film never gets old. Which i think the joyous soundtrack has apart to play who can forget Bryan Adams 16 week chart topper. From bed knobs & Broomsticks to Avatar for me Robin Hood will always stand out. So if you want to see a classic or a film to take you back to your youth this is the one and if you asked me to sum it up two words Booming Brilliant.

    I've always been a fan of the character Robin Hood. Thus I try to expose myself to as many adaptions and versions of the character as possible. This movie has a good action, and was thoroughly entertaining. The casting was very well done also with Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, and Christian Slater (whose name is very familiar, but I can't think of any movie he has been in). My only complaint is that Robin Hood (played by Kevin Costner) is from England, but lacks an English accent. Is it just me? I think a convincing English accent could have put this movie over the top. But all in all a very solid film, and love Alan Rickman as the villain. I also did not realize how closely Robin Hood: Men in Tights follows this plot line.

    Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves ***(out of 4) 143 mins/ PG Cast: Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Christian Slater, Alan Rickman, Geraldine McEwan, Michael McShane, Brian Blessed, Michael Wincott, Nick Brimble, Sean Connery Director: Kevin Reynolds Plot: After Robin returns from the Crusades, he trains up a band of merry men to fight against the tyranny of the Sheriff of Nottingham. JJ's Verdict: In Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, we may have awfully cheesy dialogue but with ridiculous amounts of fun and epic swashbuckling that Robin Hood should always be. In the Hollywood version of Robin Hood, we have the traditional story we have always loved with one or two aspects tweaked for good effect - no silly sub-plots like Ridley Scott's 2010 version. Robin returns from the crusades with a Muslim warrior Azeem and finds his father dead, and that the Sheriff of Nottingham is plotting to take the crown from the absent Richard the Lionheart. From here, Robin and Azeem come across a band of men, driven from their homes by Nottingham. Whilst also entertaining Lady Marian, the King's cousin, Robin and Azeem train the local villagers to into an army to fight and rise up against the dictatorship of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Yes, Kevin Costner and Christian Slater's accents stink, but Prince of Thieves is so much fun. From its heroic theme tune and Bryan Adams epic power ballad, to its dazzling, swashbuckling sword waving and total charm, this is probably the finest and most accomplished action/adventure film since Indiana Jones. The ambushes are all brilliantly set-up and choreographed and all the characters are great fun. Kevin Costner brings charm and strong patriotism to his role, and has great chemistry with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Lady Marian. Morgan Freeman is his usual knowledgeable self and Alan Rickman is just brilliantly over-the-top as the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. Christian Slater's character does at first seem like an arrogant idiot but even he grows on you. Geraldine McEwan's fortune-telling witch is the only character who actually doesn't work. There isn't much to its actual plot but Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an absolute (if incredibly cheesy) blast. It has a thrilling action finale and to top it all off, Sean Connery appears at the end as King Richard. Harmless fun!

    Aren't Robin Hood movies supposed to be fun? Robin's band of outlaws are called the Merry Men are they not? There's nothing merry about this movie. This is a bleak and gloomy telling of the Robin Hood story. You could forgive all the gloom if the story was compelling. But it's not. Somehow they managed to make a boring Robin Hood movie. Robin Hood is traditionally such an interesting character you wouldn't think it would be possible to make a telling of his tale so dull. But the story fails to engage and the performance of Robin Hood himself, Kevin Costner, leaves so much to be desired. Costner turns in a flat, lifeless performance. He gets Robin Hood all wrong. Costner may be many things but a swashbuckler is not one of them. Robin Hood is supposed to be an inspiring character, a leader of men. Costner's Robin Hood inspires nothing but yawns. Costner's dud performance would be enough to sink the movie. But the movie has myriad other problems too. The famous love story of Robin Hood and Maid Marian falls completely flat. There is no spark whatsoever between Costner and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio who plays Marian. Robin's Merry Men range from forgettable to, in the case of Will Scarlet, incredibly annoying. Will, played rather terribly by Christian Slater, spends the whole movie acting like a whiny, petulant spoiled brat. The movie eventually gets around to trying to explain his behavior and that effort, like pretty much everything else in the movie, is just stupid. Speaking of stupid, there's a witch who the Sheriff of Nottingham looks to for guidance. Every moment this witch is on the screen is just excruciating. She's the worst character in the movie which is saying a lot because this movie has no shortage of terrible characters. The only person able to inject some life into the movie is Alan Rickman who chews all available scenery as the villainous Sheriff. He has some personality which the rest of the movie, Costner most notably, sorely lacks. This movie has no joy, it's no fun. Who asked for a dark and dreary Robin Hood? The characters are not engaging, the action scenes are uninspiring, the whole thing is just completely lifeless. The Robin Hood of legend is a great hero. That Robin Hood does not appear in this movie.

    I know this came out 22 years ago, but this still my favorite Robin Hood movie. I like this even more that the Russell Crowe movie. I think the casting of the characters was exceptional in that Kevin Costner, Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio were perfect for their roles. I have several favorite parts in this movie but at the top of the list is when Azeem (Morgan Freeman) gives his speech toward the end of the movie asking all the commoners to fight for their freedom. Another favorite scene is when Robin Hood finds out he has a brother, Will Scarlett. And finally, the scene where Robin and the Sheriff fight at the end. Those are my top three favorites. Although I like him, I think the scene at the very end where King Richard "crashes" the wedding between Robin and Marian was an after thought especially when King Richard was played by Sean Connery. If you're going to have a huge actor in such a small roll to make it seem bigger, why choose Sean Connery. Still a great movie! Timeless!

    It's a decent Robin Hood film, even if there are some uneven passages. Freeman wasn't bad but I didn't get what his character should bring to the story. And they didn't know where they should go with Marian; first she was built up as a strong-willed and confident swashbuckling character, then she became a Damsel-in-Distress ... Apart from that, the film was OK; the basic rules for Robin Hood stories (outlaws outwitting the Sheriff's men) are adhered to, and the production values and sets are good. Some people made fun of his accent, but Kevin Costner has a roguish smile fitting the character and I couldn't care less about his accent (maybe a Britishman will disagree).

    Great Kevin Costner who did a formidable interpretation, Morgan Freeman a true professionist, screenplay interesting and fascinating. Really a beautiful movie that shows all of his skills and his hability with an intense story and an adrenalinic envelopment. Is able to be serious and simple, with a lot of characteristic scenes and spectacular events. A narration of a history part well done and complete of every single detail. The dark part doesn't forget to be in a principal role, explaning the situations in a clear way and in a mysterious way too. The twists are a lot, the actors did great, the scenic design is high quality, all the necessary technical works where done with cure and precis passion. Beautiful for real and left sings.

    ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES, a medieval romp of wenches, women, warriors, wild men and the woods, is, taken at face value, an old-fashioned crowd-pleaser of a film. It's a deliberate throwback to the days of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, featuring a tough, swashbuckling hero, a rich tapestry of a storyline bringing together all of the clich&eacute;s, and plenty of action for archery fans to enjoy. It also happens to be packed full of errors, both geographical and factual, and it features some of the cheesiest performances outside of a local pantomime. That's part of the charm. First off, this isn't a film to be taken seriously. From the moment Robin washes up in Dover and announces that he'll be in Nottingham by nightfall, you know that getting the historical details right wasn't the priority of the scriptwriter. The detour to Hadrian's Wall en route is still unintentionally hilarious, and the mumbo-jumbo pagan cult stuff is just as out of place as the presence of the lost boys in Ridley Scott's po-faced take on the myth, ROBIN HOOD. But along the way, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES is a lot of fun. Yes, it's nonsense, but it's entertaining tosh and I for one was thoroughly enjoying myself while I watched it. Okay, so Costner's gruff seriousness grates more than a little, as does the vomit-inducing romantic sub-plot with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's wishy-washy Maid Marian, but at least Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott get into the spirit of things with delightfully over-the-top villainous turns that belong, yes, in a pantomime. Goodness knows what Morgan Freeman thinks he's up to, prowling around in the background as an out-of-place Moor, but he adds entertainment value too  as does Christian Slater's weaselly Will Scarlett. There's action aplenty, along with a touch of viciousness and horror as the Sheriff of Nottingham consults a grisly old witch woman; not the usual kind of stuff you find in family fare. This movie is certainly no masterpiece, but there's something about it that's undeniably charming.

    This awful song rolls across the credits courtesy of mediocre Canadian soft rocker Bryan Adams. It sets the tone for this movie. It's something you'll either love or hate, in my case it's a bit of both. There's a good story here about Robin Hood returning from the Crusades to find his father dead and leading the English people in rebellion against the tyrannical Sheriff but Kevin Costner is so bad in this it's almost lost. The performances of Alan Rickman, Morgan Freeman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio all almost make up for how bad Costner is in this. In a joke from Robin: Men in Tights Cary Elwes' Robin Hood says, "unlike some other Robin Hoods I can speak with an English accent," alluding to the other major problem with Costner's performance-no attempt at sounding English. Instead he sounds like a nondescript American with a bad hair day sporting his post-Crusade mullet. Alan Rickman's scene stealing performance as The Sheriff of Nottingham aided by his devil worshiping foster mother is something to behold. His over-the-top displays of temper and mustache-twirling evil are a lot of fun to watch. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's Maid Marian is a strong-willed woman committed to watching after an English people seemingly abandoned by Richard the Lionheart (which it was) and men like Robin Hood who rushed off to the Crusades in religious zeal or the pursuit of riches. Morgan Freeman is Azeem, Robin's solemn Moorish companion, who acts as an unwanted protector and straight man. Surprisingly there's no mention of Prince John, Richard I's brother, who is often depicted in Robin Hood adaptations as working with the Sheriff and Sir Guy of Gisbon to usurp the throne.

    Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is an excellent adventure, with a bit of silliness, some romance, a few laughs, and plenty action. Kevin Costner is at his best. It might not be Morgan Freeman's greatest role, but he plays it admirably well, with a good accent, a nice straight-face funny attitude, intelligent, and full of vigor. He represent a strong black male figure anyone can admire. Alan Rickman is excellent as the evil and silly sheriff. As his despicable sidekick, Michael Wincott is just perfect. Christian Slater was good, but disappointing in his dramatic scene. The rest of the cast was on target. Great photography, nice score, good editing, interesting story. beautiful sets, nice costumes. It has everything to make for a great evening. Now for the little negative bits. Beyond the fact that Robin Hood is a mythical figure, the movie is in no way historically accurate, and the same can be said of the hair styles. Don't take it seriously, and you'll enjoy it.
