    New York City, mid 1990's, the heart of America's theater community, a mecca for artists, and thus, filled with a gay population that is certain to be over the rumored 10 percent. For handsome Steve Weber, frustration with his sex life and lack of a romantic life, his decision to concentrate only on working out is stalled with a handsome spotter (Michael Weiss) who happens to be HIV positive. This at first isn't an obstacle for the somewhat neurotic Weber but when it comes to making it to their first date, he can't bring himself to go there. So what does Weiss do? Call him up and ball him out? No. Go to a bar and drink to forget? No. He cries a little, dances around the room to get over his hurt, but then picks himself up, dusts himself off, and starts all over again. But like Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli in "Arthur", Weber and Weiss get caught between the moon and New York City, and thanks to some very understanding friends (among them, acerbic Patrick Stewart), come to terms with their differences, all with humor and tears, and only a bit of pathos. Gay camp humor is abound here as you have Sigourney Weaver as a self-help guru (she can spot a homosexual and a heavy-set woman with low-self esteem immediately in her audience), Christine Baranski as a socialite hosting a "Hoe-down for AIDS", Olympia Dukakis as the mother of a transsexual lesbian (shades of her character from "Tales From the City") and Nathan Lane as a show-tune singing priest. Stewart offers both bitchy humor ("Does this scarf make me look like some gay super hero?") and wise father-like advice as he deals with his own crisis (his dying lover, a chorus boy from "Cats" who shocks Stewart by revealing he has no idea who Ann Miller is!), while a cigarette smoking Mother Theresa look-alike keeps popping in and out. There's wonderful sights of New York's Greewich and West Village (Sheraton Square and Washington Square) and a disturbing gay bashing scene (where one of them appears to be hiding his own sexuality), plus a starry finale that might appear over the top and unrealistic, but certainly every romantic gay man's fantasy. So this isn't a picture perfect adaption of a hit Broadway play, but it is totally entertaining and fast moving, one that may satisfy more for its moments than its total structure. The acting is first rate, although some of the performances are often characteratures rather than fleshed out individuals. This makes it a bit sitcomish in spots, but in the case of this film, that is not an obstacle to enjoying it, only a minor snafu.

    Jeffrey should have been a major massive blockbuster, a sure-fire smash hit, just take a look at some of the names on the cast, Christine Baranski, Patrick Stewart, Sigourney Weaver, Kathy Najimy, Nathan Lane and Olympia Dukakis, yet it failed to set the queer or the straight world alight. Jeffrey a gay romantic comedy from America came out in 1995/6 and was based on a Paul Rudnick play about a young gay New York guy who considers sex is too dangerous in the days of AIDS and commits to a life of celibacy. Just to throw a spanner in the works and pad the film out another hour he meets the man of his dreams, whom surprise surprise just happens to be HIV+. It starred Steven Weber who was nice enough as the insipid Jeffrey an actor/waiter who is supposed to be AIDSaphobic, which just does not wash. Michael T. Weissis handsome and some nice eye-candy but you just wish he would get on and so something, anything as this film drags on and on and ever on. It would have been a total flop and dire mess on the floor of movie history were it not for the dozens of big names doing small cameos - Olympia Dukakis, Robert Klein, Nathan Lane, Kathy Najimy, Kevin Nealon, Ethan Phillips, Sigourney Weaver and Christine Baranski for example.

    When Rudnick's right, he's unbeatable (Addams Family Values, In & Out) and when he's not, he reeks (Isn't She Great). Not having seen Jeffrey as a play, I can't attest to its workability in that form, but as a film, it never really gets off the ground. But as a series of loosely-connected vignettes, it's entertaining. The cameos by various stars are very good; Patrick Stewart's performance outshines the vehicle; and a number of trenchant points about America's ongoing confusion about sexuality are made. I have to keep writing because there's a minimum number of lines of text, which is a completely stupid rule.

    When a movie sports supporting (and even bit players) who are more interesting than the schmuck who happens to carry the load of an entire plot, something is sorely missing. Even so, a movie has to be made, and men like the title character -- Jeffrey (Steven Weber, looking at ease in a part that gives him one note, that is, to look and be lost and drowning in self-pity) -- do exist (I have known several and the only thing to do is to run the opposite direction and never look back in case one turns into a pillar of salt) and their drama, or lack thereof, is the stuff that could induce anyone to plant a bullet through their temples to be done with the pain. Now, let's see. Jeffrey's pain is that he's sworn off sex altogether. About this time he meets the Man of His Dreams (Michael T. Weiss, oozing dark masculinity). The catch: this Man is HIV-positive. So the dilemma lies: to be with a man who may or may not survive such a deadly disease (and risk his own life, since a moment of passion may be the dividing line between life and death) or to turn around and continue looking for Mr. Goodbar, even when Mr. Goodbar is right there for the asking. The premise makes for a a story that should be much, much darker and introspective, but Paul Rudnick has decided to make it a romantic comedy, and it works for the most part. Again, and going back to the top of this article, it's the supporting characters and bit players who make the adventures of Jeffrey worth experiencing: consider one surreal scene where Jeffrey calls his parents, who are extremely, implausibly, hilariously in tune with the times (when in fact they shouldn't) and go into frank discussions about Jeffrey's (lack of a) sex life. Looking at them, all 1950s excess, yammering in gay lingo, is enough to have anyone rolling on the floor. Other scenes are of equal hilarity: Patrick Stewart interrupting Kevin Nealon (as a reporter) announcing the sex change of a bit player (then unknown Gregory Ibarra) whose mother (Olympia Dukakis) has a whale of a time posing for cameras, and Nathan Lane as a priest who (unsuccessfully) tries to seduce Weber at church in a rather bizarre moment. Of the cast, however, Bryan Batt is the one who almost walks away with the movie as Stewart's lover, also dying of AIDS, and has some pretty outlandish scenes which make his character memorable. And of course, any movie that lampoons Mother Theresa has to have my vote, especially when it manages to pepper an erstwhile campy romance scene. One of the better entries of the Nineties not to feature gay men as unable to have sex lives and wallowing in corners, and a hoot to watch.

    Have to say that I felt sick after watching this film.....one big fat fluffy mess. Its just jumping on the band wagon of the caring 90's "fad" of political correctness. Not even Sigourney Weaver could save this celluloid abomination. What a waste of time. It was disturbing to see elderly parents discussing gay saunas with their son....Im not a puritan at all....but it was just stupid and not even funny. The actor playing jeffrey...whoa..... was one of the worst performance I've ever seen !....I was told by a friend who is HIV positive that he actually walked out of this film at a screening 15 minutes into it because it was so agitating. I decided to hire it and see for myself why so many people, mostly gay, say that this is the worst movie they have ever seen.....now I know. Watch "The boys in the Band" (not really AIDS related) and "The Band Played On" (AIDS related) if you want to see something thats decent and at least watchable. Avoid this one....Im sure the director gets embarrassed when he looks back and realises what a mess this stupid film was.

    Almost a breakthrough for queer cinema: a homosexual cater-waiter in New York City swears off sex in the AIDS-era but soon finds himself falling for a hunk who is HIV positive. Paul Rudnick adapted his own play for the screen, allowing his gay characters to act upon their desires and not just whine about them (which is what cramped the film-version of "Torch Song Trilogy"). Yet, the tone of the picture wavers as if the filmmakers weren't sure whether they were doing a fanciful comedy, a satire, a tragi-comedy with pathos, a revue, or a love story in the more traditional sense. The central leads (Steven Weber and Michael T. Weiss) are handsome and charming, but the intrusive star-cameos (directed broadly for big laughs) do not work. A semi-serious movie about tentative gay love can always stand a sense of humor (self-effacing or otherwise), but hamming and camping gets old pretty fast. ** from ****

    I met Jeffrey quite by accident, when I was searching frantically for anything by the late cabaret singer, Nancy Lamott, whose "On the Way to your Heart" is a brief, but outstanding song among many in the film. Nowhere could I find that she had recorded this song to CD, so I purchased the movie, just to obtain the song. What a terrific find in every way! The story and performances are wonderful, and every piece of the music is to die for. (I later located and purchased a CD of the Jeffrey soundtrack, and also bought another copy of the movie - as much as I have watched and re-watched, the first one is sure to wear out!) While I don't think Jeffrey is considered a "musical" in the true sense of the word, I would classify it as that, just because the music is such an integral part of the story and serves as a perfect bridge from one scene to the next. If you are a Nancy Lamott fan or just love great music (there is also an especially memorable performance by Connie Petruk, among others), I highly recommend you look into Jeffrey. For me the movie was a bonus; a real treat that I didn't even think I'd be interested in. It's now one of my all-time favorites and I'd love to let everyone in on it, not only because it's a great movie, but also to continue to share the musical legacy of the beautiful and amazing Nancy Lamott, whom I discovered only about two months before her untimely death in late 1995. Get the movie (and the music). You won't be disappointed.

    This is, and has been since 1995, my favorite movie. Jeffrey, staring Steven Weber, Michael T. Weiss, Patrick Stewart and Bryan Bratt, also has many, many parts played by extremely well-known actors. Kathy Najimi, Kevin Nealon, Olympia Dukakis, Sigourney Weaver, Christine Baranski, Victor Garber, Robert Klein, and Camryn Manheim, just to name a few. To sum it up, it shows how important friends are in our time of need. This is one movie I can watch over and over, and I have seen it probably two dozen times or more. The writing, acting and music are flawless, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll love it! This is the one, single movie I can quote the most amount of lines from.

    The world is a scary place, and serious contemplation of that could be enough to cause anyone to shut down. So, what happens when, in the face of the AIDS tragedy, one handsome, young gay man decides that he'd rather be celibate than risk it all? Worse yet, what happens when he then meets the man of his dreams who turns out to be HIV positive? Rent this little gem to find out. Jeffrey (Steven Weber) is a handsome, young, single gay man in New York City, who is letting his fear of AIDS run his life. In fact, he is so afraid of AIDS that he has decided that celibacy is the only way to protect himself from it. And considering the kinds of sexual encounters we see him engaged in during the opening sequence of the film, that may not be such a bad idea. His closest friends, Sterling (Patrick Stewart), a wise old decorator, and his partner, Darius (Bryan Batta), a dancer in the musical Cats, don't necessarily agree with Jeffrey, but they remain supportive. And then one day at the gym, Jeffrey meets trainer, Steve Howard (Michael T. Weiss), a very handsome man who is very interested in Jeffrey. After agonizing over the decision, Jeffrey agrees to go out with Steve, but before their first date, Steve tells Jeffrey that he is HIV positive, and Jeffrey cancels. As the movie goes on, Jeffrey experiences several life changing events which cause him to question the wisdom of his insistence on celibacy, and to wonder if a life without risks is a life worth living. It's rather a delightful script, full of wit and silliness, and flights of fancy. But underneath it all, there is a seriousness to the message, which only makes the comedy that much funnier. And its message about taking risks in life is one that should resonate universally. The acting was superb. Batt's uneducated, kept dancer is nicely done, in that we see that he's not stupid, he's just not sophisticated. Stewart camps it up with hilarious results, and yet his serious scenes show just how much range and talent this fine actor has. Weiss gives a nice performance as a man with a confident exterior who is still quite vulnerable underneath. Weber plays Jeffrey's uncertainty very well, and is surprisingly good as a gay man. Fun little film that shouldn't be taken too seriously, but which still has a serious message. And one well worth watching.

    I saw the trailer for this film on another DVD and ordered it on the strength of that. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed throughout, save for the enjoyable camping by Patrick Stewart and an all-too-brief appearance by the always deft Nathan Lane. I think the film is best enjoyed by a female audience, the whole thing plays to camp stereotypes and I think many gay guys will find it insulting. (At least if they're sober..) Certainly Patrick Stewart seems to be enjoying the role, in his pink beret and flouncing neckerchiefs, but generally I'm left thinking it's the woeful product of a straight person's impression of the gay world. Its self-indulgent, self-conscious, smug and embarrassing. Sorry.

If you are a Nancy Lamott fan or just love great music (there is also an especially memorable performance by Connie Petruk, among others), I highly recommend you look into Jeffrey. For me the movie was a bonus; a real treat that I didn't even think I'd be interested in. It's now one of my all-time favorites and I'd love to let everyone in on it, not only because it's a great movie, but also to continue to share the musical legacy of the beautiful and amazing Nancy Lamott, whom I discovered only about two months before her untimely death in late 1995. Get the movie (and the music). You won't be disappointed.

    This is, and has been since 1995, my favorite movie. Jeffrey, staring Steven Weber, Michael T. Weiss, Patrick Stewart and Bryan Bratt, also has many, many parts played by extremely well-known actors. Kathy Najimi, Kevin Nealon, Olympia Dukakis, Sigourney Weaver, Christine Baranski, Victor Garber, Robert Klein, and Camryn Manheim, just to name a few. To sum it up, it shows how important friends are in our time of need. This is one movie I can watch over and over, and I have seen it probably two dozen times or more. The writing, acting and music are flawless, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll love it! This is the one, single movie I can quote the most amount of lines from.

    The world is a scary place, and serious contemplation of that could be enough to cause anyone to shut down. So, what happens when, in the face of the AIDS tragedy, one handsome, young gay man decides that he'd rather be celibate than risk it all? Worse yet, what happens when he then meets the man of his dreams who turns out to be HIV positive? Rent this little gem to find out. Jeffrey (Steven Weber) is a handsome, young, single gay man in New York City, who is letting his fear of AIDS run his life. In fact, he is so afraid of AIDS that he has decided that celibacy is the only way to protect himself from it. And considering the kinds of sexual encounters we see him engaged in during the opening sequence of the film, that may not be such a bad idea. His closest friends, Sterling (Patrick Stewart), a wise old decorator, and his partner, Darius (Bryan Batta), a dancer in the musical Cats, don't necessarily agree with Jeffrey, but they remain supportive. And then one day at the gym, Jeffrey meets trainer, Steve Howard (Michael T. Weiss), a very handsome man who is very interested in Jeffrey. After agonizing over the decision, Jeffrey agrees to go out with Steve, but before their first date, Steve tells Jeffrey that he is HIV positive, and Jeffrey cancels. As the movie goes on, Jeffrey experiences several life changing events which cause him to question the wisdom of his insistence on celibacy, and to wonder if a life without risks is a life worth living. It's rather a delightful script, full of wit and silliness, and flights of fancy. But underneath it all, there is a seriousness to the message, which only makes the comedy that much funnier. And its message about taking risks in life is one that should resonate universally. The acting was superb. Batt's uneducated, kept dancer is nicely done, in that we see that he's not stupid, he's just not sophisticated. Stewart camps it up with hilarious results, and yet his serious scenes show just how much range and talent this fine actor has. Weiss gives a nice performance as a man with a confident exterior who is still quite vulnerable underneath. Weber plays Jeffrey's uncertainty very well, and is surprisingly good as a gay man. Fun little film that shouldn't be taken too seriously, but which still has a serious message. And one well worth watching.

    I saw the trailer for this film on another DVD and ordered it on the strength of that. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed throughout, save for the enjoyable camping by Patrick Stewart and an all-too-brief appearance by the always deft Nathan Lane. I think the film is best enjoyed by a female audience, the whole thing plays to camp stereotypes and I think many gay guys will find it insulting. (At least if they're sober..) Certainly Patrick Stewart seems to be enjoying the role, in his pink beret and flouncing neckerchiefs, but generally I'm left thinking it's the woeful product of a straight person's impression of the gay world. Its self-indulgent, self-conscious, smug and embarrassing. Sorry.

    New York City, mid 1990's, the heart of America's theater community, a mecca for artists, and thus, filled with a gay population that is certain to be over the rumored 10 percent. For handsome Steve Weber, frustration with his sex life and lack of a romantic life, his decision to concentrate only on working out is stalled with a handsome spotter (Michael Weiss) who happens to be HIV positive. This at first isn't an obstacle for the somewhat neurotic Weber but when it comes to making it to their first date, he can't bring himself to go there. So what does Weiss do? Call him up and ball him out? No. Go to a bar and drink to forget? No. He cries a little, dances around the room to get over his hurt, but then picks himself up, dusts himself off, and starts all over again. But like Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli in "Arthur", Weber and Weiss get caught between the moon and New York City, and thanks to some very understanding friends (among them, acerbic Patrick Stewart), come to terms with their differences, all with humor and tears, and only a bit of pathos. Gay camp humor is abound here as you have Sigourney Weaver as a self-help guru (she can spot a homosexual and a heavy-set woman with low-self esteem immediately in her audience), Christine Baranski as a socialite hosting a "Hoe-down for AIDS", Olympia Dukakis as the mother of a transsexual lesbian (shades of her character from "Tales From the City") and Nathan Lane as a show-tune singing priest. Stewart offers both bitchy humor ("Does this scarf make me look like some gay super hero?") and wise father-like advice as he deals with his own crisis (his dying lover, a chorus boy from "Cats" who shocks Stewart by revealing he has no idea who Ann Miller is!), while a cigarette smoking Mother Theresa look-alike keeps popping in and out. There's wonderful sights of New York's Greewich and West Village (Sheraton Square and Washington Square) and a disturbing gay bashing scene (where one of them appears to be hiding his own sexuality), plus a starry finale that might appear over the top and unrealistic, but certainly every romantic gay man's fantasy. So this isn't a picture perfect adaption of a hit Broadway play, but it is totally entertaining and fast moving, one that may satisfy more for its moments than its total structure. The acting is first rate, although some of the performances are often characteratures rather than fleshed out individuals. This makes it a bit sitcomish in spots, but in the case of this film, that is not an obstacle to enjoying it, only a minor snafu.

    Jeffrey should have been a major massive blockbuster, a sure-fire smash hit, just take a look at some of the names on the cast, Christine Baranski, Patrick Stewart, Sigourney Weaver, Kathy Najimy, Nathan Lane and Olympia Dukakis, yet it failed to set the queer or the straight world alight. Jeffrey a gay romantic comedy from America came out in 1995/6 and was based on a Paul Rudnick play about a young gay New York guy who considers sex is too dangerous in the days of AIDS and commits to a life of celibacy. Just to throw a spanner in the works and pad the film out another hour he meets the man of his dreams, whom surprise surprise just happens to be HIV+. It starred Steven Weber who was nice enough as the insipid Jeffrey an actor/waiter who is supposed to be AIDSaphobic, which just does not wash. Michael T. Weissis handsome and some nice eye-candy but you just wish he would get on and so something, anything as this film drags on and on and ever on. It would have been a total flop and dire mess on the floor of movie history were it not for the dozens of big names doing small cameos - Olympia Dukakis, Robert Klein, Nathan Lane, Kathy Najimy, Kevin Nealon, Ethan Phillips, Sigourney Weaver and Christine Baranski for example.

    When Rudnick's right, he's unbeatable (Addams Family Values, In & Out) and when he's not, he reeks (Isn't She Great). Not having seen Jeffrey as a play, I can't attest to its workability in that form, but as a film, it never really gets off the ground. But as a series of loosely-connected vignettes, it's entertaining. The cameos by various stars are very good; Patrick Stewart's performance outshines the vehicle; and a number of trenchant points about America's ongoing confusion about sexuality are made. I have to keep writing because there's a minimum number of lines of text, which is a completely stupid rule.

    When a movie sports supporting (and even bit players) who are more interesting than the schmuck who happens to carry the load of an entire plot, something is sorely missing. Even so, a movie has to be made, and men like the title character -- Jeffrey (Steven Weber, looking at ease in a part that gives him one note, that is, to look and be lost and drowning in self-pity) -- do exist (I have known several and the only thing to do is to run the opposite direction and never look back in case one turns into a pillar of salt) and their drama, or lack thereof, is the stuff that could induce anyone to plant a bullet through their temples to be done with the pain. Now, let's see. Jeffrey's pain is that he's sworn off sex altogether. About this time he meets the Man of His Dreams (Michael T. Weiss, oozing dark masculinity). The catch: this Man is HIV-positive. So the dilemma lies: to be with a man who may or may not survive such a deadly disease (and risk his own life, since a moment of passion may be the dividing line between life and death) or to turn around and continue looking for Mr. Goodbar, even when Mr. Goodbar is right there for the asking. The premise makes for a a story that should be much, much darker and introspective, but Paul Rudnick has decided to make it a romantic comedy, and it works for the most part. Again, and going back to the top of this article, it's the supporting characters and bit players who make the adventures of Jeffrey worth experiencing: consider one surreal scene where Jeffrey calls his parents, who are extremely, implausibly, hilariously in tune with the times (when in fact they shouldn't) and go into frank discussions about Jeffrey's (lack of a) sex life. Looking at them, all 1950s excess, yammering in gay lingo, is enough to have anyone rolling on the floor. Other scenes are of equal hilarity: Patrick Stewart interrupting Kevin Nealon (as a reporter) announcing the sex change of a bit player (then unknown Gregory Ibarra) whose mother (Olympia Dukakis) has a whale of a time posing for cameras, and Nathan Lane as a priest who (unsuccessfully) tries to seduce Weber at church in a rather bizarre moment. Of the cast, however, Bryan Batt is the one who almost walks away with the movie as Stewart's lover, also dying of AIDS, and has some pretty outlandish scenes which make his character memorable. And of course, any movie that lampoons Mother Theresa has to have my vote, especially when it manages to pepper an erstwhile campy romance scene. One of the better entries of the Nineties not to feature gay men as unable to have sex lives and wallowing in corners, and a hoot to watch.

    Have to say that I felt sick after watching this film.....one big fat fluffy mess. Its just jumping on the band wagon of the caring 90's "fad" of political correctness. Not even Sigourney Weaver could save this celluloid abomination. What a waste of time. It was disturbing to see elderly parents discussing gay saunas with their son....Im not a puritan at all....but it was just stupid and not even funny. The actor playing jeffrey...whoa..... was one of the worst performance I've ever seen !....I was told by a friend who is HIV positive that he actually walked out of this film at a screening 15 minutes into it because it was so agitating. I decided to hire it and see for myself why so many people, mostly gay, say that this is the worst movie they have ever seen.....now I know. Watch "The boys in the Band" (not really AIDS related) and "The Band Played On" (AIDS related) if you want to see something thats decent and at least watchable. Avoid this one....Im sure the director gets embarrassed when he looks back and realises what a mess this stupid film was.

    Almost a breakthrough for queer cinema: a homosexual cater-waiter in New York City swears off sex in the AIDS-era but soon finds himself falling for a hunk who is HIV positive. Paul Rudnick adapted his own play for the screen, allowing his gay characters to act upon their desires and not just whine about them (which is what cramped the film-version of "Torch Song Trilogy"). Yet, the tone of the picture wavers as if the filmmakers weren't sure whether they were doing a fanciful comedy, a satire, a tragi-comedy with pathos, a revue, or a love story in the more traditional sense. The central leads (Steven Weber and Michael T. Weiss) are handsome and charming, but the intrusive star-cameos (directed broadly for big laughs) do not work. A semi-serious movie about tentative gay love can always stand a sense of humor (self-effacing or otherwise), but hamming and camping gets old pretty fast. ** from ****

    I met Jeffrey quite by accident, when I was searching frantically for anything by the late cabaret singer, Nancy Lamott, whose "On the Way to your Heart" is a brief, but outstanding song among many in the film. Nowhere could I find that she had recorded this song to CD, so I purchased the movie, just to obtain the song. What a terrific find in every way! The story and performances are wonderful, and every piece of the music is to die for. (I later located and purchased a CD of the Jeffrey soundtrack, and also bought another copy of the movie - as much as I have watched and re-watched, the first one is sure to wear out!) While I don't think Jeffrey is considered a "musical" in the true sense of the word, I would classify it as that, just because the music is such an integral part of the story and serves as a perfect bridge from one scene to the next. If you are a Nancy Lamott fan or just love great music (there is also an especially memorable performance by Connie Petruk, among others), I highly recommend you look into Jeffrey. For me the movie was a bonus; a real treat that I didn't even think I'd be interested in. It's now one of my all-time favorites and I'd love to let everyone in on it, not only because it's a great movie, but also to continue to share the musical legacy of the beautiful and amazing Nancy Lamott, whom I discovered only about two months before her untimely death in late 1995. Get the movie (and the music). You won't be disappointed.

    Have to say that I felt sick after watching this film.....one big fat fluffy mess. Its just jumping on the band wagon of the caring 90's "fad" of political correctness. Not even Sigourney Weaver could save this celluloid abomination. What a waste of time. It was disturbing to see elderly parents discussing gay saunas with their son....Im not a puritan at all....but it was just stupid and not even funny. The actor playing jeffrey...whoa..... was one of the worst performance I've ever seen !....I was told by a friend who is HIV positive that he actually walked out of this film at a screening 15 minutes into it because it was so agitating. I decided to hire it and see for myself why so many people, mostly gay, say that this is the worst movie they have ever seen.....now I know. Watch "The boys in the Band" (not really AIDS related) and "The Band Played On" (AIDS related) if you want to see something thats decent and at least watchable. Avoid this one....Im sure the director gets embarrassed when he looks back and realises what a mess this stupid film was.

    Almost a breakthrough for queer cinema: a homosexual cater-waiter in New York City swears off sex in the AIDS-era but soon finds himself falling for a hunk who is HIV positive. Paul Rudnick adapted his own play for the screen, allowing his gay characters to act upon their desires and not just whine about them (which is what cramped the film-version of "Torch Song Trilogy"). Yet, the tone of the picture wavers as if the filmmakers weren't sure whether they were doing a fanciful comedy, a satire, a tragi-comedy with pathos, a revue, or a love story in the more traditional sense. The central leads (Steven Weber and Michael T. Weiss) are handsome and charming, but the intrusive star-cameos (directed broadly for big laughs) do not work. A semi-serious movie about tentative gay love can always stand a sense of humor (self-effacing or otherwise), but hamming and camping gets old pretty fast. ** from ****

    I met Jeffrey quite by accident, when I was searching frantically for anything by the late cabaret singer, Nancy Lamott, whose "On the Way to your Heart" is a brief, but outstanding song among many in the film. Nowhere could I find that she had recorded this song to CD, so I purchased the movie, just to obtain the song. What a terrific find in every way! The story and performances are wonderful, and every piece of the music is to die for. (I later located and purchased a CD of the Jeffrey soundtrack, and also bought another copy of the movie - as much as I have watched and re-watched, the first one is sure to wear out!) While I don't think Jeffrey is considered a "musical" in the true sense of the word, I would classify it as that, just because the music is such an integral part of the story and serves as a perfect bridge from one scene to the next. If you are a Nancy Lamott fan or just love great music (there is also an especially memorable performance by Connie Petruk, among others), I highly recommend you look into Jeffrey. For me the movie was a bonus; a real treat that I didn't even think I'd be interested in. It's now one of my all-time favorites and I'd love to let everyone in on it, not only because it's a great movie, but also to continue to share the musical legacy of the beautiful and amazing Nancy Lamott, whom I discovered only about two months before her untimely death in late 1995. Get the movie (and the music). You won't be disappointed.

    This is, and has been since 1995, my favorite movie. Jeffrey, staring Steven Weber, Michael T. Weiss, Patrick Stewart and Bryan Bratt, also has many, many parts played by extremely well-known actors. Kathy Najimi, Kevin Nealon, Olympia Dukakis, Sigourney Weaver, Christine Baranski, Victor Garber, Robert Klein, and Camryn Manheim, just to name a few. To sum it up, it shows how important friends are in our time of need. This is one movie I can watch over and over, and I have seen it probably two dozen times or more. The writing, acting and music are flawless, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll love it! This is the one, single movie I can quote the most amount of lines from.

    The world is a scary place, and serious contemplation of that could be enough to cause anyone to shut down. So, what happens when, in the face of the AIDS tragedy, one handsome, young gay man decides that he'd rather be celibate than risk it all? Worse yet, what happens when he then meets the man of his dreams who turns out to be HIV positive? Rent this little gem to find out. Jeffrey (Steven Weber) is a handsome, young, single gay man in New York City, who is letting his fear of AIDS run his life. In fact, he is so afraid of AIDS that he has decided that celibacy is the only way to protect himself from it. And considering the kinds of sexual encounters we see him engaged in during the opening sequence of the film, that may not be such a bad idea. His closest friends, Sterling (Patrick Stewart), a wise old decorator, and his partner, Darius (Bryan Batta), a dancer in the musical Cats, don't necessarily agree with Jeffrey, but they remain supportive. And then one day at the gym, Jeffrey meets trainer, Steve Howard (Michael T. Weiss), a very handsome man who is very interested in Jeffrey. After agonizing over the decision, Jeffrey agrees to go out with Steve, but before their first date, Steve tells Jeffrey that he is HIV positive, and Jeffrey cancels. As the movie goes on, Jeffrey experiences several life changing events which cause him to question the wisdom of his insistence on celibacy, and to wonder if a life without risks is a life worth living. It's rather a delightful script, full of wit and silliness, and flights of fancy. But underneath it all, there is a seriousness to the message, which only makes the comedy that much funnier. And its message about taking risks in life is one that should resonate universally. The acting was superb. Batt's uneducated, kept dancer is nicely done, in that we see that he's not stupid, he's just not sophisticated. Stewart camps it up with hilarious results, and yet his serious scenes show just how much range and talent this fine actor has. Weiss gives a nice performance as a man with a confident exterior who is still quite vulnerable underneath. Weber plays Jeffrey's uncertainty very well, and is surprisingly good as a gay man. Fun little film that shouldn't be taken too seriously, but which still has a serious message. And one well worth watching.

    I saw the trailer for this film on another DVD and ordered it on the strength of that. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed throughout, save for the enjoyable camping by Patrick Stewart and an all-too-brief appearance by the always deft Nathan Lane. I think the film is best enjoyed by a female audience, the whole thing plays to camp stereotypes and I think many gay guys will find it insulting. (At least if they're sober..) Certainly Patrick Stewart seems to be enjoying the role, in his pink beret and flouncing neckerchiefs, but generally I'm left thinking it's the woeful product of a straight person's impression of the gay world. Its self-indulgent, self-conscious, smug and embarrassing. Sorry.

    New York City, mid 1990's, the heart of America's theater community, a mecca for artists, and thus, filled with a gay population that is certain to be over the rumored 10 percent. For handsome Steve Weber, frustration with his sex life and lack of a romantic life, his decision to concentrate only on working out is stalled with a handsome spotter (Michael Weiss) who happens to be HIV positive. This at first isn't an obstacle for the somewhat neurotic Weber but when it comes to making it to their first date, he can't bring himself to go there. So what does Weiss do? Call him up and ball him out? No. Go to a bar and drink to forget? No. He cries a little, dances around the room to get over his hurt, but then picks himself up, dusts himself off, and starts all over again. But like Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli in "Arthur", Weber and Weiss get caught between the moon and New York City, and thanks to some very understanding friends (among them, acerbic Patrick Stewart), come to terms with their differences, all with humor and tears, and only a bit of pathos. Gay camp humor is abound here as you have Sigourney Weaver as a self-help guru (she can spot a homosexual and a heavy-set woman with low-self esteem immediately in her audience), Christine Baranski as a socialite hosting a "Hoe-down for AIDS", Olympia Dukakis as the mother of a transsexual lesbian (shades of her character from "Tales From the City") and Nathan Lane as a show-tune singing priest. Stewart offers both bitchy humor ("Does this scarf make me look like some gay super hero?") and wise father-like advice as he deals with his own crisis (his dying lover, a chorus boy from "Cats" who shocks Stewart by revealing he has no idea who Ann Miller is!), while a cigarette smoking Mother Theresa look-alike keeps popping in and out. There's wonderful sights of New York's Greewich and West Village (Sheraton Square and Washington Square) and a disturbing gay bashing scene (where one of them appears to be hiding his own sexuality), plus a starry finale that might appear over the top and unrealistic, but certainly every romantic gay man's fantasy. So this isn't a picture perfect adaption of a hit Broadway play, but it is totally entertaining and fast moving, one that may satisfy more for its moments than its total structure. The acting is first rate, although some of the performances are often characteratures rather than fleshed out individuals. This makes it a bit sitcomish in spots, but in the case of this film, that is not an obstacle to enjoying it, only a minor snafu.

    Jeffrey should have been a major massive blockbuster, a sure-fire smash hit, just take a look at some of the names on the cast, Christine Baranski, Patrick Stewart, Sigourney Weaver, Kathy Najimy, Nathan Lane and Olympia Dukakis, yet it failed to set the queer or the straight world alight. Jeffrey a gay romantic comedy from America came out in 1995/6 and was based on a Paul Rudnick play about a young gay New York guy who considers sex is too dangerous in the days of AIDS and commits to a life of celibacy. Just to throw a spanner in the works and pad the film out another hour he meets the man of his dreams, whom surprise surprise just happens to be HIV+. It starred Steven Weber who was nice enough as the insipid Jeffrey an actor/waiter who is supposed to be AIDSaphobic, which just does not wash. Michael T. Weissis handsome and some nice eye-candy but you just wish he would get on and so something, anything as this film drags on and on and ever on. It would have been a total flop and dire mess on the floor of movie history were it not for the dozens of big names doing small cameos - Olympia Dukakis, Robert Klein, Nathan Lane, Kathy Najimy, Kevin Nealon, Ethan Phillips, Sigourney Weaver and Christine Baranski for example.

    When Rudnick's right, he's unbeatable (Addams Family Values, In & Out) and when he's not, he reeks (Isn't She Great). Not having seen Jeffrey as a play, I can't attest to its workability in that form, but as a film, it never really gets off the ground. But as a series of loosely-connected vignettes, it's entertaining. The cameos by various stars are very good; Patrick Stewart's performance outshines the vehicle; and a number of trenchant points about America's ongoing confusion about sexuality are made. I have to keep writing because there's a minimum number of lines of text, which is a completely stupid rule.

    When a movie sports supporting (and even bit players) who are more interesting than the schmuck who happens to carry the load of an entire plot, something is sorely missing. Even so, a movie has to be made, and men like the title character -- Jeffrey (Steven Weber, looking at ease in a part that gives him one note, that is, to look and be lost and drowning in self-pity) -- do exist (I have known several and the only thing to do is to run the opposite direction and never look back in case one turns into a pillar of salt) and their drama, or lack thereof, is the stuff that could induce anyone to plant a bullet through their temples to be done with the pain. Now, let's see. Jeffrey's pain is that he's sworn off sex altogether. About this time he meets the Man of His Dreams (Michael T. Weiss, oozing dark masculinity). The catch: this Man is HIV-positive. So the dilemma lies: to be with a man who may or may not survive such a deadly disease (and risk his own life, since a moment of passion may be the dividing line between life and death) or to turn around and continue looking for Mr. Goodbar, even when Mr. Goodbar is right there for the asking. The premise makes for a a story that should be much, much darker and introspective, but Paul Rudnick has decided to make it a romantic comedy, and it works for the most part. Again, and going back to the top of this article, it's the supporting characters and bit players who make the adventures of Jeffrey worth experiencing: consider one surreal scene where Jeffrey calls his parents, who are extremely, implausibly, hilariously in tune with the times (when in fact they shouldn't) and go into frank discussions about Jeffrey's (lack of a) sex life. Looking at them, all 1950s excess, yammering in gay lingo, is enough to have anyone rolling on the floor. Other scenes are of equal hilarity: Patrick Stewart interrupting Kevin Nealon (as a reporter) announcing the sex change of a bit player (then unknown Gregory Ibarra) whose mother (Olympia Dukakis) has a whale of a time posing for cameras, and Nathan Lane as a priest who (unsuccessfully) tries to seduce Weber at church in a rather bizarre moment. Of the cast, however, Bryan Batt is the one who almost walks away with the movie as Stewart's lover, also dying of AIDS, and has some pretty outlandish scenes which make his character memorable. And of course, any movie that lampoons Mother Theresa has to have my vote, especially when it manages to pepper an erstwhile campy romance scene. One of the better entries of the Nineties not to feature gay men as unable to have sex lives and wallowing in corners, and a hoot to watch.

I have to keep writing because there's a minimum number of lines of text, which is a completely stupid rule.

    When a movie sports supporting (and even bit players) who are more interesting than the schmuck who happens to carry the load of an entire plot, something is sorely missing. Even so, a movie has to be made, and men like the title character -- Jeffrey (Steven Weber, looking at ease in a part that gives him one note, that is, to look and be lost and drowning in self-pity) -- do exist (I have known several and the only thing to do is to run the opposite direction and never look back in case one turns into a pillar of salt) and their drama, or lack thereof, is the stuff that could induce anyone to plant a bullet through their temples to be done with the pain. Now, let's see. Jeffrey's pain is that he's sworn off sex altogether. About this time he meets the Man of His Dreams (Michael T. Weiss, oozing dark masculinity). The catch: this Man is HIV-positive. So the dilemma lies: to be with a man who may or may not survive such a deadly disease (and risk his own life, since a moment of passion may be the dividing line between life and death) or to turn around and continue looking for Mr. Goodbar, even when Mr. Goodbar is right there for the asking. The premise makes for a a story that should be much, much darker and introspective, but Paul Rudnick has decided to make it a romantic comedy, and it works for the most part. Again, and going back to the top of this article, it's the supporting characters and bit players who make the adventures of Jeffrey worth experiencing: consider one surreal scene where Jeffrey calls his parents, who are extremely, implausibly, hilariously in tune with the times (when in fact they shouldn't) and go into frank discussions about Jeffrey's (lack of a) sex life. Looking at them, all 1950s excess, yammering in gay lingo, is enough to have anyone rolling on the floor. Other scenes are of equal hilarity: Patrick Stewart interrupting Kevin Nealon (as a reporter) announcing the sex change of a bit player (then unknown Gregory Ibarra) whose mother (Olympia Dukakis) has a whale of a time posing for cameras, and Nathan Lane as a priest who (unsuccessfully) tries to seduce Weber at church in a rather bizarre moment. Of the cast, however, Bryan Batt is the one who almost walks away with the movie as Stewart's lover, also dying of AIDS, and has some pretty outlandish scenes which make his character memorable. And of course, any movie that lampoons Mother Theresa has to have my vote, especially when it manages to pepper an erstwhile campy romance scene. One of the better entries of the Nineties not to feature gay men as unable to have sex lives and wallowing in corners, and a hoot to watch.

    Have to say that I felt sick after watching this film.....one big fat fluffy mess. Its just jumping on the band wagon of the caring 90's "fad" of political correctness. Not even Sigourney Weaver could save this celluloid abomination. What a waste of time. It was disturbing to see elderly parents discussing gay saunas with their son....Im not a puritan at all....but it was just stupid and not even funny. The actor playing jeffrey...whoa..... was one of the worst performance I've ever seen !....I was told by a friend who is HIV positive that he actually walked out of this film at a screening 15 minutes into it because it was so agitating. I decided to hire it and see for myself why so many people, mostly gay, say that this is the worst movie they have ever seen.....now I know. Watch "The boys in the Band" (not really AIDS related) and "The Band Played On" (AIDS related) if you want to see something thats decent and at least watchable. Avoid this one....Im sure the director gets embarrassed when he looks back and realises what a mess this stupid film was.

    Almost a breakthrough for queer cinema: a homosexual cater-waiter in New York City swears off sex in the AIDS-era but soon finds himself falling for a hunk who is HIV positive. Paul Rudnick adapted his own play for the screen, allowing his gay characters to act upon their desires and not just whine about them (which is what cramped the film-version of "Torch Song Trilogy"). Yet, the tone of the picture wavers as if the filmmakers weren't sure whether they were doing a fanciful comedy, a satire, a tragi-comedy with pathos, a revue, or a love story in the more traditional sense. The central leads (Steven Weber and Michael T. Weiss) are handsome and charming, but the intrusive star-cameos (directed broadly for big laughs) do not work. A semi-serious movie about tentative gay love can always stand a sense of humor (self-effacing or otherwise), but hamming and camping gets old pretty fast. ** from ****

    I met Jeffrey quite by accident, when I was searching frantically for anything by the late cabaret singer, Nancy Lamott, whose "On the Way to your Heart" is a brief, but outstanding song among many in the film. Nowhere could I find that she had recorded this song to CD, so I purchased the movie, just to obtain the song. What a terrific find in every way! The story and performances are wonderful, and every piece of the music is to die for. (I later located and purchased a CD of the Jeffrey soundtrack, and also bought another copy of the movie - as much as I have watched and re-watched, the first one is sure to wear out!) While I don't think Jeffrey is considered a "musical" in the true sense of the word, I would classify it as that, just because the music is such an integral part of the story and serves as a perfect bridge from one scene to the next. If you are a Nancy Lamott fan or just love great music (there is also an especially memorable performance by Connie Petruk, among others), I highly recommend you look into Jeffrey. For me the movie was a bonus; a real treat that I didn't even think I'd be interested in. It's now one of my all-time favorites and I'd love to let everyone in on it, not only because it's a great movie, but also to continue to share the musical legacy of the beautiful and amazing Nancy Lamott, whom I discovered only about two months before her untimely death in late 1995. Get the movie (and the music). You won't be disappointed.

    This is, and has been since 1995, my favorite movie. Jeffrey, staring Steven Weber, Michael T. Weiss, Patrick Stewart and Bryan Bratt, also has many, many parts played by extremely well-known actors. Kathy Najimi, Kevin Nealon, Olympia Dukakis, Sigourney Weaver, Christine Baranski, Victor Garber, Robert Klein, and Camryn Manheim, just to name a few. To sum it up, it shows how important friends are in our time of need. This is one movie I can watch over and over, and I have seen it probably two dozen times or more. The writing, acting and music are flawless, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll love it! This is the one, single movie I can quote the most amount of lines from.

    The world is a scary place, and serious contemplation of that could be enough to cause anyone to shut down. So, what happens when, in the face of the AIDS tragedy, one handsome, young gay man decides that he'd rather be celibate than risk it all? Worse yet, what happens when he then meets the man of his dreams who turns out to be HIV positive? Rent this little gem to find out. Jeffrey (Steven Weber) is a handsome, young, single gay man in New York City, who is letting his fear of AIDS run his life. In fact, he is so afraid of AIDS that he has decided that celibacy is the only way to protect himself from it. And considering the kinds of sexual encounters we see him engaged in during the opening sequence of the film, that may not be such a bad idea. His closest friends, Sterling (Patrick Stewart), a wise old decorator, and his partner, Darius (Bryan Batta), a dancer in the musical Cats, don't necessarily agree with Jeffrey, but they remain supportive. And then one day at the gym, Jeffrey meets trainer, Steve Howard (Michael T. Weiss), a very handsome man who is very interested in Jeffrey. After agonizing over the decision, Jeffrey agrees to go out with Steve, but before their first date, Steve tells Jeffrey that he is HIV positive, and Jeffrey cancels. As the movie goes on, Jeffrey experiences several life changing events which cause him to question the wisdom of his insistence on celibacy, and to wonder if a life without risks is a life worth living. It's rather a delightful script, full of wit and silliness, and flights of fancy. But underneath it all, there is a seriousness to the message, which only makes the comedy that much funnier. And its message about taking risks in life is one that should resonate universally. The acting was superb. Batt's uneducated, kept dancer is nicely done, in that we see that he's not stupid, he's just not sophisticated. Stewart camps it up with hilarious results, and yet his serious scenes show just how much range and talent this fine actor has. Weiss gives a nice performance as a man with a confident exterior who is still quite vulnerable underneath. Weber plays Jeffrey's uncertainty very well, and is surprisingly good as a gay man. Fun little film that shouldn't be taken too seriously, but which still has a serious message. And one well worth watching.

    I saw the trailer for this film on another DVD and ordered it on the strength of that. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed throughout, save for the enjoyable camping by Patrick Stewart and an all-too-brief appearance by the always deft Nathan Lane. I think the film is best enjoyed by a female audience, the whole thing plays to camp stereotypes and I think many gay guys will find it insulting. (At least if they're sober..) Certainly Patrick Stewart seems to be enjoying the role, in his pink beret and flouncing neckerchiefs, but generally I'm left thinking it's the woeful product of a straight person's impression of the gay world. Its self-indulgent, self-conscious, smug and embarrassing. Sorry.
