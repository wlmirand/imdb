 <sinopse>
  A cemetery man must kill the dead a second time when they become zombies.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  This movie is based on a novel of Tiziano Sclavi, and it always reflects the "sclavian philosophy" diffused by the most succesful comics in Italy: Dylan Dog, the detective of the nightmare. There is the duality between love and dead (in Italian "dellamore" means "of love" and "dellamorte" means "of death"), a duality that Dellamorte feels in a really hard way. He is the guardian of the cemetery of Buffalora, a little town in the north of Italy, in which, we don't know why, corpses rise from tombs and Dellamorte has to destroy them. Dellamorte seems not to ask to himself why this happen, he shoots and loves. But at the end he wants to leave Buffalora...

    It's not often that the Italians come up with a clever, funny, imaginative horror movie. Suspiria was the best straightforward slasher/horror movie they produced, but by far, maybe one of the most underrated horror movies of all time, "Cemetery Man" is the best film I've seen in the genre out of Italy. It stars Rupert Everett as the lead character, Francesco Dellamorte, who works for a town called Buffalora. His job is to keep the dead people who rise from their graves in the cemetery. He's not sure exactly why, or why they come back, but it doesn't really bother him. He's got other concerns, like his constant philosophical musings on life. His best sentence in the film is, "The living dead and the dying living. Cut from the same cloth." His cohort in this is Gnaghi, a fat, bumbling, Three Stooges type who answers in one word grunts and lives in the basement watching old war footage all day long. That may sound weird, but Dellamorte spends his time reading phone books. Anna Falchi shows up at her husband's funeral, and later as a hooker, and also as the mayor's assistant. The whole time Dellamorte is in love with her, but isn't sure if she's real, or imaginary, dead or alive. The Grim Reaper also makes an appearance, telling Dellamorte to stop killing the dead, and kill the living before they become dead. Makes sense, in a mortifyingly simple way. In the end, Dellamorte and Gnaghi decide it's time to escape the town. How that goes is up to you to find out, because I seriously don't want to ruin this movie for you. It's funny, touching, thought provoking, disgusting and clever, all rolled into one. If you can find this movie, absolutely watch it. It's well worth every minute. _____________ For all the Horror Banana reviews, visit http://morozov924.hubpages.com/

    This plays as if Argento, Kafka, Dali, Leone and Romero went to the pub one night, got hammered on absinthe and collectively said: "You know what would be a good idea for a film...?" CEMETERY MAN is an Italian black comedy zombie flick that effortlessly succeeds at being weird, bizarre, unconventional, erotic and generally unnerving throughout. It is at times crass and gross, arty and visually sensual, confusing and uneven. But it remains consistently quite compelling and utterly impossible to pigeonhole. Rupert Everett plays the caretaker of a provincial cemetery where the dead come to life and it's his job to put them back in the ground by delivering extreme head trauma with bullet, blade and blunt instrument. Add three women in his life, played by the same actress but apparently different characters, a semi-mute and mentally deficient assistant who is in love with a talking severed head in a bridal veil, a dumb and clueless cop, a gang of biker delinquents, serial murder and the grim reaper himself. Then chuck in some metaphysical philosophy on the nature of existence and what constitutes the world, life and death, along with a dash of surrealism, a pinch of necrophilia and a large dose of graphic violence and gore and there you have it. Or there you don't exactly, because these elements only scratch the surface without touching upon the multiple undercurrents, plot threads and shrouded meanings running beneath. It was a financial failure and critically ill-received on release. Prime cult fodder, then, and that status gave it a reputation and saved it from obscurity. Whether you enjoy it or not is in the lap of the gods. I can imagine a lot of people had their expectations subverted because without some foreknowledge it isn't going to be what most would expect. The wide-open-to-interpretation ending will please some and confound others. If you are on the lookout for something twisted, off key and original, give it a shot. Just don't expect a conventional zombie-fest.

    Given that in certain quarters of the hardcore horror fan community 'Dellamorte Dellamore' is considered somewhat of a misunderstood classic I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. After hearing so much about the movie and reading reviews raving about its merits I went in fully expecting a piece akin to horror classics like The Evil Dead and The Thing. My expectations were obviously too high, and had I watched it free of all the hype and cult murmurings I believe I would have enjoyed it a lot more.What I got was a fairly good little horror movie, though one that falls way short of those that grace the upper echelons of the genre.

    Cemetery Man suffered immensely in the United States from poor marketing by its American distributors. The title was changed to Cemetery Man from the original Italian title and given a schlock and camp-filled ad campaign painting the movie as just another zombie film in an already saturated market. Consequently it was released to critical and commercial failure. Instead of the campy zombie film most people were expecting when they bought their tickets, Cemetery Man delivers something much more rare: intelligent and thought-provoking ideas in a horror film. Yes, we do get our primitive desire to see zombie carnage (and then some) fulfilled but we also get something to think about. See this film if you are in the mood for a zombie flick but would also like something that offers a lot more substance than anything by Fulci and most Romero films post-1978. I recommend this to people who like zombie flicks but also those who like a good drama. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.

    "I'd give my life to be dead." Cemetery Man is definitely the weirdest "zombie movie" I've ever seen. Whether that's a good thing or not depends solely on the individual viewer.&nbsp; A cemetery caretaker and his big, mono-syllabic assistant watch over a graveyard where some of the dead have a habit of crawling out of their caskets seven days after they die and attempting to munch on the living. A beautiful widow (seriously, Anna Falchi is stunning in this and fortunately you get to see a lot of her) interrupts the duo's nightly routine of headshots and re-burial, and things quickly get even weirder.&nbsp; Cemetery Man is campy at times, there's lots of old school gore, black humor, murder sprees, a supernatural reoccurring love story, odd characters and shifts in tone (the first half is VERY different from the latter half). Imagine an Italian Army of Darkness meets David Lynch and penis injections (you'll have to see it to understand). Actually, "you'll have to see it to understand" is the best review I can give this movie.&nbsp;

    I am usually a HUGE fan of B-movies, horror films, movies so bad they are good and especially movies with zombies in. This film, I had waited to see for several years after never being able to find a copy. Once I'd finally found the copy I was excited, and I truly wanted to love this movie. Alas, I couldn't. Within the first minute or so, I realised how poorly the film had been made. The editing is bad, the dubbing is bad, the acting is awful, etc. etc. I could go on. I sat through about half an hour of this utter tripe, waiting for the redeeming feature that made me love it. It never came, and I gave up. Firstly, the "ghostly floating camera" effect is just irritating. It is not artistic at all, it is amateur. it is overused and boring. Secondly, Rupert Everett CAN act, although in this film his acting skills have been put to one side, and he becomes the most boring person ever. Thirdly, this film escalates in strange ways to situations that are just not plausible. I get it that it is a zombie film, but I enjoy aspects of realism in zombie films, and this has none. I can keep going on, but to summarise my criticism - the script is absolutely dire, the acting is terrible all round (not just Ruper Everett), the storyline is ridiculous and the zombies look rubbish. This film has been called "funny", "a masterpiece" etc. It is none of these. It really is just a boring, dire movie. If Rupert Everett wasn't in it, it would never have received any recognition at all. It reminds me of the absolutely interminable "City Of The Dead"by Lucio Fulci. I have always thought that Lucio Fulci is possibly one of the worst directors ever (worse than Uwe Boll in my eyes), but this film seems to be as bad as his works. Michele Soavi should be ashamed of himself.

    This movie is incredibly slow paced all the way trough I was tempted to put it on fast forward... The acting for the most part is really poor. The dialogues are uninteresting and poorly constructed. But the beginning and ending monologues are really interesting and make the movie a whole lot better than it would have been without. There are quite few original turn and twist to this movie (the flying zombie head my oh my that was a lot of fun and completely unexpected for me), some of the zombies make use of basic logic and it can be quite interesting. The characters are all somewhat insane and make for few laugh... I gave this movie a 5 only because I still wonder if I liked it or not the best I can say is watch it and find out for yourself as this movie made hi itself a little place amongst the cult zombie movies it cant be a total waste of your time to watch it.

    Imagine you have a choice. You can either have your teeth knocked out with a hammer and rusty chisel, or watch this movie. Having seen this movie, I'd choose getting my teeth pounded out. I would get more out of it than anything this movie can offer. This movie is nothing but a mish-mash of unrelated nonsense. You may dig it if you are into necro-porn. "Death Bed: The Bed that Eats" is better than this. "Manimal" is better than this. "Stroker Ace" is better than this. "Megaforce" is better than this. Every movie ever made is better than this. Don't waste your time. If you're bored, chew on some tinfoil or try to drill into your own head without killing yourself. It'll be more fun and make more sense.

    This movie was another sci-fiction/horror stinker that I rented based on the reviews that I read on this site! Buyer Beware! There is no sense to this movie. It is another strange foreign film. I can't compare it to anything that I have seen before but if you are the type of viewer that likes your movies to have a plot or a point than do not rent this movie. I would say, in summary, that it is a French or Italian art film with some zombies in it. Good acting.......no logic, no plot, incoherent. I don't get what so many of the reviewers saw in this movie. My kind of zombie movies are not that hard to please me. Night of the living Dead, Dawn of the Dead. Day of the Dead, Return of the Living Dead are all fine examples of great zombie movies. They don't require a lot of special effects, great acting or much at at all...just have a plot and make sense. I guess that this movie was supposed to be a comedy but I did not think that it was funny. I guess that the humor was supposed to be ironic or coy. The ending was also a stinker. I just didn't get it. Forgive my simple tastes!

    The plot is as follows... well, actually, the plot doesn't really follow anything. There is his guy called Francesco Dellamorte or Francesco Love of Death if you prefer (played exceptionally eerily by Rupert Everett), who works as a cemetery supervisor. His assistant Igor... oh wait... Gnaghi (Fran&ccedil;ois Hadji-Lazaro) is sort of dumb and for most of the movie says nothing more than 'gna'. Then there is this girl. Let's call her She (the ravishingly beautiful Anna Falchi) who loves getting naked and having sex with Francesco. Even after death. And also after death after death. And than again after death after death after death. And Death is also at the party. And walking dead high on mandragora. Boyscout zombies all inclusive. All a very yummy wacky cocktail, which makes for a surreal hybrid of David Lynch, Monty Python and early Peter Jackson. But you would be mistaken that the plot of the movie is wacky fun deep. Actually beneath the gory zombie killing, eye-catching nudity and witty dark absurd humour the author of this movie actually has something to say with a very interesting comment of human life punctuated with a surreal, slightly unexpected but surprisingly intelligent ending. Additionally the cinematography is exceptional - heavily indebted to the Italian horror school - which makes the film hit even harder into memory. This is also a coming of age movie for Dario Argento's protegee, Michele Soavi. A very underrated movie which requires rewatching to fully catch the drift of the movie. A movie that goes much deeper than it B-movie cover would suggest - essentially it's a slightly silly, but brilliant tractate about life and death.

I guess that this movie was supposed to be a comedy but I did not think that it was funny. I guess that the humor was supposed to be ironic or coy. The ending was also a stinker. I just didn't get it. Forgive my simple tastes!

    The plot is as follows... well, actually, the plot doesn't really follow anything. There is his guy called Francesco Dellamorte or Francesco Love of Death if you prefer (played exceptionally eerily by Rupert Everett), who works as a cemetery supervisor. His assistant Igor... oh wait... Gnaghi (Fran&ccedil;ois Hadji-Lazaro) is sort of dumb and for most of the movie says nothing more than 'gna'. Then there is this girl. Let's call her She (the ravishingly beautiful Anna Falchi) who loves getting naked and having sex with Francesco. Even after death. And also after death after death. And than again after death after death after death. And Death is also at the party. And walking dead high on mandragora. Boyscout zombies all inclusive. All a very yummy wacky cocktail, which makes for a surreal hybrid of David Lynch, Monty Python and early Peter Jackson. But you would be mistaken that the plot of the movie is wacky fun deep. Actually beneath the gory zombie killing, eye-catching nudity and witty dark absurd humour the author of this movie actually has something to say with a very interesting comment of human life punctuated with a surreal, slightly unexpected but surprisingly intelligent ending. Additionally the cinematography is exceptional - heavily indebted to the Italian horror school - which makes the film hit even harder into memory. This is also a coming of age movie for Dario Argento's protegee, Michele Soavi. A very underrated movie which requires rewatching to fully catch the drift of the movie. A movie that goes much deeper than it B-movie cover would suggest - essentially it's a slightly silly, but brilliant tractate about life and death.

    It's not often that the Italians come up with a clever, funny, imaginative horror movie. Suspiria was the best straightforward slasher/horror movie they produced, but by far, maybe one of the most underrated horror movies of all time, "Cemetery Man" is the best film I've seen in the genre out of Italy. It stars Rupert Everett as the lead character, Francesco Dellamorte, who works for a town called Buffalora. His job is to keep the dead people who rise from their graves in the cemetery. He's not sure exactly why, or why they come back, but it doesn't really bother him. He's got other concerns, like his constant philosophical musings on life. His best sentence in the film is, "The living dead and the dying living. Cut from the same cloth." His cohort in this is Gnaghi, a fat, bumbling, Three Stooges type who answers in one word grunts and lives in the basement watching old war footage all day long. That may sound weird, but Dellamorte spends his time reading phone books. Anna Falchi shows up at her husband's funeral, and later as a hooker, and also as the mayor's assistant. The whole time Dellamorte is in love with her, but isn't sure if she's real, or imaginary, dead or alive. The Grim Reaper also makes an appearance, telling Dellamorte to stop killing the dead, and kill the living before they become dead. Makes sense, in a mortifyingly simple way. In the end, Dellamorte and Gnaghi decide it's time to escape the town. How that goes is up to you to find out, because I seriously don't want to ruin this movie for you. It's funny, touching, thought provoking, disgusting and clever, all rolled into one. If you can find this movie, absolutely watch it. It's well worth every minute. _____________ For all the Horror Banana reviews, visit http://morozov924.hubpages.com/

    This plays as if Argento, Kafka, Dali, Leone and Romero went to the pub one night, got hammered on absinthe and collectively said: "You know what would be a good idea for a film...?" CEMETERY MAN is an Italian black comedy zombie flick that effortlessly succeeds at being weird, bizarre, unconventional, erotic and generally unnerving throughout. It is at times crass and gross, arty and visually sensual, confusing and uneven. But it remains consistently quite compelling and utterly impossible to pigeonhole. Rupert Everett plays the caretaker of a provincial cemetery where the dead come to life and it's his job to put them back in the ground by delivering extreme head trauma with bullet, blade and blunt instrument. Add three women in his life, played by the same actress but apparently different characters, a semi-mute and mentally deficient assistant who is in love with a talking severed head in a bridal veil, a dumb and clueless cop, a gang of biker delinquents, serial murder and the grim reaper himself. Then chuck in some metaphysical philosophy on the nature of existence and what constitutes the world, life and death, along with a dash of surrealism, a pinch of necrophilia and a large dose of graphic violence and gore and there you have it. Or there you don't exactly, because these elements only scratch the surface without touching upon the multiple undercurrents, plot threads and shrouded meanings running beneath. It was a financial failure and critically ill-received on release. Prime cult fodder, then, and that status gave it a reputation and saved it from obscurity. Whether you enjoy it or not is in the lap of the gods. I can imagine a lot of people had their expectations subverted because without some foreknowledge it isn't going to be what most would expect. The wide-open-to-interpretation ending will please some and confound others. If you are on the lookout for something twisted, off key and original, give it a shot. Just don't expect a conventional zombie-fest.

    Given that in certain quarters of the hardcore horror fan community 'Dellamorte Dellamore' is considered somewhat of a misunderstood classic I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. After hearing so much about the movie and reading reviews raving about its merits I went in fully expecting a piece akin to horror classics like The Evil Dead and The Thing. My expectations were obviously too high, and had I watched it free of all the hype and cult murmurings I believe I would have enjoyed it a lot more.What I got was a fairly good little horror movie, though one that falls way short of those that grace the upper echelons of the genre.

    Cemetery Man suffered immensely in the United States from poor marketing by its American distributors. The title was changed to Cemetery Man from the original Italian title and given a schlock and camp-filled ad campaign painting the movie as just another zombie film in an already saturated market. Consequently it was released to critical and commercial failure. Instead of the campy zombie film most people were expecting when they bought their tickets, Cemetery Man delivers something much more rare: intelligent and thought-provoking ideas in a horror film. Yes, we do get our primitive desire to see zombie carnage (and then some) fulfilled but we also get something to think about. See this film if you are in the mood for a zombie flick but would also like something that offers a lot more substance than anything by Fulci and most Romero films post-1978. I recommend this to people who like zombie flicks but also those who like a good drama. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.

    "I'd give my life to be dead." Cemetery Man is definitely the weirdest "zombie movie" I've ever seen. Whether that's a good thing or not depends solely on the individual viewer.&nbsp; A cemetery caretaker and his big, mono-syllabic assistant watch over a graveyard where some of the dead have a habit of crawling out of their caskets seven days after they die and attempting to munch on the living. A beautiful widow (seriously, Anna Falchi is stunning in this and fortunately you get to see a lot of her) interrupts the duo's nightly routine of headshots and re-burial, and things quickly get even weirder.&nbsp; Cemetery Man is campy at times, there's lots of old school gore, black humor, murder sprees, a supernatural reoccurring love story, odd characters and shifts in tone (the first half is VERY different from the latter half). Imagine an Italian Army of Darkness meets David Lynch and penis injections (you'll have to see it to understand). Actually, "you'll have to see it to understand" is the best review I can give this movie.&nbsp;

    I am usually a HUGE fan of B-movies, horror films, movies so bad they are good and especially movies with zombies in. This film, I had waited to see for several years after never being able to find a copy. Once I'd finally found the copy I was excited, and I truly wanted to love this movie. Alas, I couldn't. Within the first minute or so, I realised how poorly the film had been made. The editing is bad, the dubbing is bad, the acting is awful, etc. etc. I could go on. I sat through about half an hour of this utter tripe, waiting for the redeeming feature that made me love it. It never came, and I gave up. Firstly, the "ghostly floating camera" effect is just irritating. It is not artistic at all, it is amateur. it is overused and boring. Secondly, Rupert Everett CAN act, although in this film his acting skills have been put to one side, and he becomes the most boring person ever. Thirdly, this film escalates in strange ways to situations that are just not plausible. I get it that it is a zombie film, but I enjoy aspects of realism in zombie films, and this has none. I can keep going on, but to summarise my criticism - the script is absolutely dire, the acting is terrible all round (not just Ruper Everett), the storyline is ridiculous and the zombies look rubbish. This film has been called "funny", "a masterpiece" etc. It is none of these. It really is just a boring, dire movie. If Rupert Everett wasn't in it, it would never have received any recognition at all. It reminds me of the absolutely interminable "City Of The Dead"by Lucio Fulci. I have always thought that Lucio Fulci is possibly one of the worst directors ever (worse than Uwe Boll in my eyes), but this film seems to be as bad as his works. Michele Soavi should be ashamed of himself.

    This movie is incredibly slow paced all the way trough I was tempted to put it on fast forward... The acting for the most part is really poor. The dialogues are uninteresting and poorly constructed. But the beginning and ending monologues are really interesting and make the movie a whole lot better than it would have been without. There are quite few original turn and twist to this movie (the flying zombie head my oh my that was a lot of fun and completely unexpected for me), some of the zombies make use of basic logic and it can be quite interesting. The characters are all somewhat insane and make for few laugh... I gave this movie a 5 only because I still wonder if I liked it or not the best I can say is watch it and find out for yourself as this movie made hi itself a little place amongst the cult zombie movies it cant be a total waste of your time to watch it.

    Imagine you have a choice. You can either have your teeth knocked out with a hammer and rusty chisel, or watch this movie. Having seen this movie, I'd choose getting my teeth pounded out. I would get more out of it than anything this movie can offer. This movie is nothing but a mish-mash of unrelated nonsense. You may dig it if you are into necro-porn. "Death Bed: The Bed that Eats" is better than this. "Manimal" is better than this. "Stroker Ace" is better than this. "Megaforce" is better than this. Every movie ever made is better than this. Don't waste your time. If you're bored, chew on some tinfoil or try to drill into your own head without killing yourself. It'll be more fun and make more sense.

    This movie was another sci-fiction/horror stinker that I rented based on the reviews that I read on this site! Buyer Beware! There is no sense to this movie. It is another strange foreign film. I can't compare it to anything that I have seen before but if you are the type of viewer that likes your movies to have a plot or a point than do not rent this movie. I would say, in summary, that it is a French or Italian art film with some zombies in it. Good acting.......no logic, no plot, incoherent. I don't get what so many of the reviewers saw in this movie. My kind of zombie movies are not that hard to please me. Night of the living Dead, Dawn of the Dead. Day of the Dead, Return of the Living Dead are all fine examples of great zombie movies.

I just didn't get it. Forgive my simple tastes!

    The plot is as follows... well, actually, the plot doesn't really follow anything. There is his guy called Francesco Dellamorte or Francesco Love of Death if you prefer (played exceptionally eerily by Rupert Everett), who works as a cemetery supervisor. His assistant Igor... oh wait... Gnaghi (Fran&ccedil;ois Hadji-Lazaro) is sort of dumb and for most of the movie says nothing more than 'gna'. Then there is this girl. Let's call her She (the ravishingly beautiful Anna Falchi) who loves getting naked and having sex with Francesco. Even after death. And also after death after death. And than again after death after death after death. And Death is also at the party. And walking dead high on mandragora. Boyscout zombies all inclusive. All a very yummy wacky cocktail, which makes for a surreal hybrid of David Lynch, Monty Python and early Peter Jackson. But you would be mistaken that the plot of the movie is wacky fun deep. Actually beneath the gory zombie killing, eye-catching nudity and witty dark absurd humour the author of this movie actually has something to say with a very interesting comment of human life punctuated with a surreal, slightly unexpected but surprisingly intelligent ending. Additionally the cinematography is exceptional - heavily indebted to the Italian horror school - which makes the film hit even harder into memory. This is also a coming of age movie for Dario Argento's protegee, Michele Soavi. A very underrated movie which requires rewatching to fully catch the drift of the movie. A movie that goes much deeper than it B-movie cover would suggest - essentially it's a slightly silly, but brilliant tractate about life and death.

    It's not often that the Italians come up with a clever, funny, imaginative horror movie. Suspiria was the best straightforward slasher/horror movie they produced, but by far, maybe one of the most underrated horror movies of all time, "Cemetery Man" is the best film I've seen in the genre out of Italy. It stars Rupert Everett as the lead character, Francesco Dellamorte, who works for a town called Buffalora. His job is to keep the dead people who rise from their graves in the cemetery. He's not sure exactly why, or why they come back, but it doesn't really bother him. He's got other concerns, like his constant philosophical musings on life. His best sentence in the film is, "The living dead and the dying living. Cut from the same cloth." His cohort in this is Gnaghi, a fat, bumbling, Three Stooges type who answers in one word grunts and lives in the basement watching old war footage all day long. That may sound weird, but Dellamorte spends his time reading phone books. Anna Falchi shows up at her husband's funeral, and later as a hooker, and also as the mayor's assistant. The whole time Dellamorte is in love with her, but isn't sure if she's real, or imaginary, dead or alive. The Grim Reaper also makes an appearance, telling Dellamorte to stop killing the dead, and kill the living before they become dead. Makes sense, in a mortifyingly simple way. In the end, Dellamorte and Gnaghi decide it's time to escape the town. How that goes is up to you to find out, because I seriously don't want to ruin this movie for you. It's funny, touching, thought provoking, disgusting and clever, all rolled into one. If you can find this movie, absolutely watch it. It's well worth every minute. _____________ For all the Horror Banana reviews, visit http://morozov924.hubpages.com/

    This plays as if Argento, Kafka, Dali, Leone and Romero went to the pub one night, got hammered on absinthe and collectively said: "You know what would be a good idea for a film...?" CEMETERY MAN is an Italian black comedy zombie flick that effortlessly succeeds at being weird, bizarre, unconventional, erotic and generally unnerving throughout. It is at times crass and gross, arty and visually sensual, confusing and uneven. But it remains consistently quite compelling and utterly impossible to pigeonhole. Rupert Everett plays the caretaker of a provincial cemetery where the dead come to life and it's his job to put them back in the ground by delivering extreme head trauma with bullet, blade and blunt instrument. Add three women in his life, played by the same actress but apparently different characters, a semi-mute and mentally deficient assistant who is in love with a talking severed head in a bridal veil, a dumb and clueless cop, a gang of biker delinquents, serial murder and the grim reaper himself. Then chuck in some metaphysical philosophy on the nature of existence and what constitutes the world, life and death, along with a dash of surrealism, a pinch of necrophilia and a large dose of graphic violence and gore and there you have it. Or there you don't exactly, because these elements only scratch the surface without touching upon the multiple undercurrents, plot threads and shrouded meanings running beneath. It was a financial failure and critically ill-received on release. Prime cult fodder, then, and that status gave it a reputation and saved it from obscurity. Whether you enjoy it or not is in the lap of the gods. I can imagine a lot of people had their expectations subverted because without some foreknowledge it isn't going to be what most would expect. The wide-open-to-interpretation ending will please some and confound others. If you are on the lookout for something twisted, off key and original, give it a shot. Just don't expect a conventional zombie-fest.

    Given that in certain quarters of the hardcore horror fan community 'Dellamorte Dellamore' is considered somewhat of a misunderstood classic I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. After hearing so much about the movie and reading reviews raving about its merits I went in fully expecting a piece akin to horror classics like The Evil Dead and The Thing. My expectations were obviously too high, and had I watched it free of all the hype and cult murmurings I believe I would have enjoyed it a lot more.What I got was a fairly good little horror movie, though one that falls way short of those that grace the upper echelons of the genre.

    Cemetery Man suffered immensely in the United States from poor marketing by its American distributors. The title was changed to Cemetery Man from the original Italian title and given a schlock and camp-filled ad campaign painting the movie as just another zombie film in an already saturated market. Consequently it was released to critical and commercial failure. Instead of the campy zombie film most people were expecting when they bought their tickets, Cemetery Man delivers something much more rare: intelligent and thought-provoking ideas in a horror film. Yes, we do get our primitive desire to see zombie carnage (and then some) fulfilled but we also get something to think about. See this film if you are in the mood for a zombie flick but would also like something that offers a lot more substance than anything by Fulci and most Romero films post-1978. I recommend this to people who like zombie flicks but also those who like a good drama. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.

    "I'd give my life to be dead." Cemetery Man is definitely the weirdest "zombie movie" I've ever seen. Whether that's a good thing or not depends solely on the individual viewer.&nbsp; A cemetery caretaker and his big, mono-syllabic assistant watch over a graveyard where some of the dead have a habit of crawling out of their caskets seven days after they die and attempting to munch on the living. A beautiful widow (seriously, Anna Falchi is stunning in this and fortunately you get to see a lot of her) interrupts the duo's nightly routine of headshots and re-burial, and things quickly get even weirder.&nbsp; Cemetery Man is campy at times, there's lots of old school gore, black humor, murder sprees, a supernatural reoccurring love story, odd characters and shifts in tone (the first half is VERY different from the latter half). Imagine an Italian Army of Darkness meets David Lynch and penis injections (you'll have to see it to understand). Actually, "you'll have to see it to understand" is the best review I can give this movie.&nbsp;

    I am usually a HUGE fan of B-movies, horror films, movies so bad they are good and especially movies with zombies in. This film, I had waited to see for several years after never being able to find a copy. Once I'd finally found the copy I was excited, and I truly wanted to love this movie. Alas, I couldn't. Within the first minute or so, I realised how poorly the film had been made. The editing is bad, the dubbing is bad, the acting is awful, etc. etc. I could go on. I sat through about half an hour of this utter tripe, waiting for the redeeming feature that made me love it. It never came, and I gave up. Firstly, the "ghostly floating camera" effect is just irritating. It is not artistic at all, it is amateur. it is overused and boring. Secondly, Rupert Everett CAN act, although in this film his acting skills have been put to one side, and he becomes the most boring person ever. Thirdly, this film escalates in strange ways to situations that are just not plausible. I get it that it is a zombie film, but I enjoy aspects of realism in zombie films, and this has none. I can keep going on, but to summarise my criticism - the script is absolutely dire, the acting is terrible all round (not just Ruper Everett), the storyline is ridiculous and the zombies look rubbish. This film has been called "funny", "a masterpiece" etc. It is none of these. It really is just a boring, dire movie. If Rupert Everett wasn't in it, it would never have received any recognition at all. It reminds me of the absolutely interminable "City Of The Dead"by Lucio Fulci. I have always thought that Lucio Fulci is possibly one of the worst directors ever (worse than Uwe Boll in my eyes), but this film seems to be as bad as his works. Michele Soavi should be ashamed of himself.

    This movie is incredibly slow paced all the way trough I was tempted to put it on fast forward... The acting for the most part is really poor. The dialogues are uninteresting and poorly constructed. But the beginning and ending monologues are really interesting and make the movie a whole lot better than it would have been without. There are quite few original turn and twist to this movie (the flying zombie head my oh my that was a lot of fun and completely unexpected for me), some of the zombies make use of basic logic and it can be quite interesting. The characters are all somewhat insane and make for few laugh... I gave this movie a 5 only because I still wonder if I liked it or not the best I can say is watch it and find out for yourself as this movie made hi itself a little place amongst the cult zombie movies it cant be a total waste of your time to watch it.

    Imagine you have a choice. You can either have your teeth knocked out with a hammer and rusty chisel, or watch this movie. Having seen this movie, I'd choose getting my teeth pounded out. I would get more out of it than anything this movie can offer. This movie is nothing but a mish-mash of unrelated nonsense. You may dig it if you are into necro-porn. "Death Bed: The Bed that Eats" is better than this. "Manimal" is better than this. "Stroker Ace" is better than this. "Megaforce" is better than this. Every movie ever made is better than this. Don't waste your time. If you're bored, chew on some tinfoil or try to drill into your own head without killing yourself. It'll be more fun and make more sense.

    This movie was another sci-fiction/horror stinker that I rented based on the reviews that I read on this site! Buyer Beware! There is no sense to this movie. It is another strange foreign film. I can't compare it to anything that I have seen before but if you are the type of viewer that likes your movies to have a plot or a point than do not rent this movie. I would say, in summary, that it is a French or Italian art film with some zombies in it. Good acting.......no logic, no plot, incoherent. I don't get what so many of the reviewers saw in this movie. My kind of zombie movies are not that hard to please me. Night of the living Dead, Dawn of the Dead. Day of the Dead, Return of the Living Dead are all fine examples of great zombie movies. They don't require a lot of special effects, great acting or much at at all...just have a plot and make sense. I guess that this movie was supposed to be a comedy but I did not think that it was funny. I guess that the humor was supposed to be ironic or coy. The ending was also a stinker.

    The plot is as follows... well, actually, the plot doesn't really follow anything. There is his guy called Francesco Dellamorte or Francesco Love of Death if you prefer (played exceptionally eerily by Rupert Everett), who works as a cemetery supervisor. His assistant Igor... oh wait... Gnaghi (Fran&ccedil;ois Hadji-Lazaro) is sort of dumb and for most of the movie says nothing more than 'gna'. Then there is this girl. Let's call her She (the ravishingly beautiful Anna Falchi) who loves getting naked and having sex with Francesco. Even after death. And also after death after death. And than again after death after death after death. And Death is also at the party. And walking dead high on mandragora. Boyscout zombies all inclusive. All a very yummy wacky cocktail, which makes for a surreal hybrid of David Lynch, Monty Python and early Peter Jackson. But you would be mistaken that the plot of the movie is wacky fun deep. Actually beneath the gory zombie killing, eye-catching nudity and witty dark absurd humour the author of this movie actually has something to say with a very interesting comment of human life punctuated with a surreal, slightly unexpected but surprisingly intelligent ending. Additionally the cinematography is exceptional - heavily indebted to the Italian horror school - which makes the film hit even harder into memory. This is also a coming of age movie for Dario Argento's protegee, Michele Soavi. A very underrated movie which requires rewatching to fully catch the drift of the movie. A movie that goes much deeper than it B-movie cover would suggest - essentially it's a slightly silly, but brilliant tractate about life and death.

    It's not often that the Italians come up with a clever, funny, imaginative horror movie. Suspiria was the best straightforward slasher/horror movie they produced, but by far, maybe one of the most underrated horror movies of all time, "Cemetery Man" is the best film I've seen in the genre out of Italy. It stars Rupert Everett as the lead character, Francesco Dellamorte, who works for a town called Buffalora. His job is to keep the dead people who rise from their graves in the cemetery. He's not sure exactly why, or why they come back, but it doesn't really bother him. He's got other concerns, like his constant philosophical musings on life. His best sentence in the film is, "The living dead and the dying living. Cut from the same cloth." His cohort in this is Gnaghi, a fat, bumbling, Three Stooges type who answers in one word grunts and lives in the basement watching old war footage all day long. That may sound weird, but Dellamorte spends his time reading phone books. Anna Falchi shows up at her husband's funeral, and later as a hooker, and also as the mayor's assistant. The whole time Dellamorte is in love with her, but isn't sure if she's real, or imaginary, dead or alive. The Grim Reaper also makes an appearance, telling Dellamorte to stop killing the dead, and kill the living before they become dead. Makes sense, in a mortifyingly simple way. In the end, Dellamorte and Gnaghi decide it's time to escape the town. How that goes is up to you to find out, because I seriously don't want to ruin this movie for you. It's funny, touching, thought provoking, disgusting and clever, all rolled into one. If you can find this movie, absolutely watch it. It's well worth every minute. _____________ For all the Horror Banana reviews, visit http://morozov924.hubpages.com/

    This plays as if Argento, Kafka, Dali, Leone and Romero went to the pub one night, got hammered on absinthe and collectively said: "You know what would be a good idea for a film...?" CEMETERY MAN is an Italian black comedy zombie flick that effortlessly succeeds at being weird, bizarre, unconventional, erotic and generally unnerving throughout. It is at times crass and gross, arty and visually sensual, confusing and uneven. But it remains consistently quite compelling and utterly impossible to pigeonhole. Rupert Everett plays the caretaker of a provincial cemetery where the dead come to life and it's his job to put them back in the ground by delivering extreme head trauma with bullet, blade and blunt instrument. Add three women in his life, played by the same actress but apparently different characters, a semi-mute and mentally deficient assistant who is in love with a talking severed head in a bridal veil, a dumb and clueless cop, a gang of biker delinquents, serial murder and the grim reaper himself. Then chuck in some metaphysical philosophy on the nature of existence and what constitutes the world, life and death, along with a dash of surrealism, a pinch of necrophilia and a large dose of graphic violence and gore and there you have it. Or there you don't exactly, because these elements only scratch the surface without touching upon the multiple undercurrents, plot threads and shrouded meanings running beneath. It was a financial failure and critically ill-received on release. Prime cult fodder, then, and that status gave it a reputation and saved it from obscurity. Whether you enjoy it or not is in the lap of the gods. I can imagine a lot of people had their expectations subverted because without some foreknowledge it isn't going to be what most would expect. The wide-open-to-interpretation ending will please some and confound others. If you are on the lookout for something twisted, off key and original, give it a shot. Just don't expect a conventional zombie-fest.

    Given that in certain quarters of the hardcore horror fan community 'Dellamorte Dellamore' is considered somewhat of a misunderstood classic I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. After hearing so much about the movie and reading reviews raving about its merits I went in fully expecting a piece akin to horror classics like The Evil Dead and The Thing. My expectations were obviously too high, and had I watched it free of all the hype and cult murmurings I believe I would have enjoyed it a lot more.What I got was a fairly good little horror movie, though one that falls way short of those that grace the upper echelons of the genre.

    Cemetery Man suffered immensely in the United States from poor marketing by its American distributors. The title was changed to Cemetery Man from the original Italian title and given a schlock and camp-filled ad campaign painting the movie as just another zombie film in an already saturated market. Consequently it was released to critical and commercial failure. Instead of the campy zombie film most people were expecting when they bought their tickets, Cemetery Man delivers something much more rare: intelligent and thought-provoking ideas in a horror film. Yes, we do get our primitive desire to see zombie carnage (and then some) fulfilled but we also get something to think about. See this film if you are in the mood for a zombie flick but would also like something that offers a lot more substance than anything by Fulci and most Romero films post-1978. I recommend this to people who like zombie flicks but also those who like a good drama. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.

    "I'd give my life to be dead." Cemetery Man is definitely the weirdest "zombie movie" I've ever seen. Whether that's a good thing or not depends solely on the individual viewer.&nbsp; A cemetery caretaker and his big, mono-syllabic assistant watch over a graveyard where some of the dead have a habit of crawling out of their caskets seven days after they die and attempting to munch on the living. A beautiful widow (seriously, Anna Falchi is stunning in this and fortunately you get to see a lot of her) interrupts the duo's nightly routine of headshots and re-burial, and things quickly get even weirder.&nbsp; Cemetery Man is campy at times, there's lots of old school gore, black humor, murder sprees, a supernatural reoccurring love story, odd characters and shifts in tone (the first half is VERY different from the latter half). Imagine an Italian Army of Darkness meets David Lynch and penis injections (you'll have to see it to understand). Actually, "you'll have to see it to understand" is the best review I can give this movie.&nbsp;

    I am usually a HUGE fan of B-movies, horror films, movies so bad they are good and especially movies with zombies in. This film, I had waited to see for several years after never being able to find a copy. Once I'd finally found the copy I was excited, and I truly wanted to love this movie. Alas, I couldn't. Within the first minute or so, I realised how poorly the film had been made. The editing is bad, the dubbing is bad, the acting is awful, etc. etc. I could go on. I sat through about half an hour of this utter tripe, waiting for the redeeming feature that made me love it. It never came, and I gave up. Firstly, the "ghostly floating camera" effect is just irritating. It is not artistic at all, it is amateur. it is overused and boring. Secondly, Rupert Everett CAN act, although in this film his acting skills have been put to one side, and he becomes the most boring person ever. Thirdly, this film escalates in strange ways to situations that are just not plausible. I get it that it is a zombie film, but I enjoy aspects of realism in zombie films, and this has none. I can keep going on, but to summarise my criticism - the script is absolutely dire, the acting is terrible all round (not just Ruper Everett), the storyline is ridiculous and the zombies look rubbish. This film has been called "funny", "a masterpiece" etc. It is none of these. It really is just a boring, dire movie. If Rupert Everett wasn't in it, it would never have received any recognition at all. It reminds me of the absolutely interminable "City Of The Dead"by Lucio Fulci. I have always thought that Lucio Fulci is possibly one of the worst directors ever (worse than Uwe Boll in my eyes), but this film seems to be as bad as his works. Michele Soavi should be ashamed of himself.

    This movie is incredibly slow paced all the way trough I was tempted to put it on fast forward... The acting for the most part is really poor. The dialogues are uninteresting and poorly constructed. But the beginning and ending monologues are really interesting and make the movie a whole lot better than it would have been without. There are quite few original turn and twist to this movie (the flying zombie head my oh my that was a lot of fun and completely unexpected for me), some of the zombies make use of basic logic and it can be quite interesting. The characters are all somewhat insane and make for few laugh... I gave this movie a 5 only because I still wonder if I liked it or not the best I can say is watch it and find out for yourself as this movie made hi itself a little place amongst the cult zombie movies it cant be a total waste of your time to watch it.

    Imagine you have a choice. You can either have your teeth knocked out with a hammer and rusty chisel, or watch this movie. Having seen this movie, I'd choose getting my teeth pounded out. I would get more out of it than anything this movie can offer. This movie is nothing but a mish-mash of unrelated nonsense. You may dig it if you are into necro-porn. "Death Bed: The Bed that Eats" is better than this. "Manimal" is better than this. "Stroker Ace" is better than this. "Megaforce" is better than this. Every movie ever made is better than this. Don't waste your time. If you're bored, chew on some tinfoil or try to drill into your own head without killing yourself. It'll be more fun and make more sense.

    This movie was another sci-fiction/horror stinker that I rented based on the reviews that I read on this site! Buyer Beware! There is no sense to this movie. It is another strange foreign film. I can't compare it to anything that I have seen before but if you are the type of viewer that likes your movies to have a plot or a point than do not rent this movie. I would say, in summary, that it is a French or Italian art film with some zombies in it. Good acting.......no logic, no plot, incoherent. I don't get what so many of the reviewers saw in this movie. My kind of zombie movies are not that hard to please me. Night of the living Dead, Dawn of the Dead. Day of the Dead, Return of the Living Dead are all fine examples of great zombie movies. They don't require a lot of special effects, great acting or much at at all...just have a plot and make sense. I guess that this movie was supposed to be a comedy but I did not think that it was funny. I guess that the humor was supposed to be ironic or coy. The ending was also a stinker. I just didn't get it. Forgive my simple tastes!

There is his guy called Francesco Dellamorte or Francesco Love of Death if you prefer (played exceptionally eerily by Rupert Everett), who works as a cemetery supervisor. His assistant Igor... oh wait... Gnaghi (Fran&ccedil;ois Hadji-Lazaro) is sort of dumb and for most of the movie says nothing more than 'gna'. Then there is this girl. Let's call her She (the ravishingly beautiful Anna Falchi) who loves getting naked and having sex with Francesco. Even after death. And also after death after death. And than again after death after death after death. And Death is also at the party. And walking dead high on mandragora. Boyscout zombies all inclusive. All a very yummy wacky cocktail, which makes for a surreal hybrid of David Lynch, Monty Python and early Peter Jackson. But you would be mistaken that the plot of the movie is wacky fun deep. Actually beneath the gory zombie killing, eye-catching nudity and witty dark absurd humour the author of this movie actually has something to say with a very interesting comment of human life punctuated with a surreal, slightly unexpected but surprisingly intelligent ending. Additionally the cinematography is exceptional - heavily indebted to the Italian horror school - which makes the film hit even harder into memory. This is also a coming of age movie for Dario Argento's protegee, Michele Soavi. A very underrated movie which requires rewatching to fully catch the drift of the movie. A movie that goes much deeper than it B-movie cover would suggest - essentially it's a slightly silly, but brilliant tractate about life and death.

    It's not often that the Italians come up with a clever, funny, imaginative horror movie. Suspiria was the best straightforward slasher/horror movie they produced, but by far, maybe one of the most underrated horror movies of all time, "Cemetery Man" is the best film I've seen in the genre out of Italy. It stars Rupert Everett as the lead character, Francesco Dellamorte, who works for a town called Buffalora. His job is to keep the dead people who rise from their graves in the cemetery. He's not sure exactly why, or why they come back, but it doesn't really bother him. He's got other concerns, like his constant philosophical musings on life. His best sentence in the film is, "The living dead and the dying living. Cut from the same cloth." His cohort in this is Gnaghi, a fat, bumbling, Three Stooges type who answers in one word grunts and lives in the basement watching old war footage all day long. That may sound weird, but Dellamorte spends his time reading phone books. Anna Falchi shows up at her husband's funeral, and later as a hooker, and also as the mayor's assistant. The whole time Dellamorte is in love with her, but isn't sure if she's real, or imaginary, dead or alive. The Grim Reaper also makes an appearance, telling Dellamorte to stop killing the dead, and kill the living before they become dead. Makes sense, in a mortifyingly simple way. In the end, Dellamorte and Gnaghi decide it's time to escape the town. How that goes is up to you to find out, because I seriously don't want to ruin this movie for you. It's funny, touching, thought provoking, disgusting and clever, all rolled into one. If you can find this movie, absolutely watch it. It's well worth every minute. _____________ For all the Horror Banana reviews, visit http://morozov924.hubpages.com/

    This plays as if Argento, Kafka, Dali, Leone and Romero went to the pub one night, got hammered on absinthe and collectively said: "You know what would be a good idea for a film...?" CEMETERY MAN is an Italian black comedy zombie flick that effortlessly succeeds at being weird, bizarre, unconventional, erotic and generally unnerving throughout. It is at times crass and gross, arty and visually sensual, confusing and uneven. But it remains consistently quite compelling and utterly impossible to pigeonhole. Rupert Everett plays the caretaker of a provincial cemetery where the dead come to life and it's his job to put them back in the ground by delivering extreme head trauma with bullet, blade and blunt instrument. Add three women in his life, played by the same actress but apparently different characters, a semi-mute and mentally deficient assistant who is in love with a talking severed head in a bridal veil, a dumb and clueless cop, a gang of biker delinquents, serial murder and the grim reaper himself. Then chuck in some metaphysical philosophy on the nature of existence and what constitutes the world, life and death, along with a dash of surrealism, a pinch of necrophilia and a large dose of graphic violence and gore and there you have it. Or there you don't exactly, because these elements only scratch the surface without touching upon the multiple undercurrents, plot threads and shrouded meanings running beneath. It was a financial failure and critically ill-received on release. Prime cult fodder, then, and that status gave it a reputation and saved it from obscurity. Whether you enjoy it or not is in the lap of the gods. I can imagine a lot of people had their expectations subverted because without some foreknowledge it isn't going to be what most would expect. The wide-open-to-interpretation ending will please some and confound others. If you are on the lookout for something twisted, off key and original, give it a shot. Just don't expect a conventional zombie-fest.

    Given that in certain quarters of the hardcore horror fan community 'Dellamorte Dellamore' is considered somewhat of a misunderstood classic I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. After hearing so much about the movie and reading reviews raving about its merits I went in fully expecting a piece akin to horror classics like The Evil Dead and The Thing. My expectations were obviously too high, and had I watched it free of all the hype and cult murmurings I believe I would have enjoyed it a lot more.What I got was a fairly good little horror movie, though one that falls way short of those that grace the upper echelons of the genre.

    Cemetery Man suffered immensely in the United States from poor marketing by its American distributors. The title was changed to Cemetery Man from the original Italian title and given a schlock and camp-filled ad campaign painting the movie as just another zombie film in an already saturated market. Consequently it was released to critical and commercial failure. Instead of the campy zombie film most people were expecting when they bought their tickets, Cemetery Man delivers something much more rare: intelligent and thought-provoking ideas in a horror film. Yes, we do get our primitive desire to see zombie carnage (and then some) fulfilled but we also get something to think about. See this film if you are in the mood for a zombie flick but would also like something that offers a lot more substance than anything by Fulci and most Romero films post-1978. I recommend this to people who like zombie flicks but also those who like a good drama. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.

    "I'd give my life to be dead." Cemetery Man is definitely the weirdest "zombie movie" I've ever seen. Whether that's a good thing or not depends solely on the individual viewer.&nbsp; A cemetery caretaker and his big, mono-syllabic assistant watch over a graveyard where some of the dead have a habit of crawling out of their caskets seven days after they die and attempting to munch on the living. A beautiful widow (seriously, Anna Falchi is stunning in this and fortunately you get to see a lot of her) interrupts the duo's nightly routine of headshots and re-burial, and things quickly get even weirder.&nbsp; Cemetery Man is campy at times, there's lots of old school gore, black humor, murder sprees, a supernatural reoccurring love story, odd characters and shifts in tone (the first half is VERY different from the latter half). Imagine an Italian Army of Darkness meets David Lynch and penis injections (you'll have to see it to understand). Actually, "you'll have to see it to understand" is the best review I can give this movie.&nbsp;

    I am usually a HUGE fan of B-movies, horror films, movies so bad they are good and especially movies with zombies in. This film, I had waited to see for several years after never being able to find a copy. Once I'd finally found the copy I was excited, and I truly wanted to love this movie. Alas, I couldn't. Within the first minute or so, I realised how poorly the film had been made. The editing is bad, the dubbing is bad, the acting is awful, etc. etc. I could go on. I sat through about half an hour of this utter tripe, waiting for the redeeming feature that made me love it. It never came, and I gave up. Firstly, the "ghostly floating camera" effect is just irritating. It is not artistic at all, it is amateur. it is overused and boring. Secondly, Rupert Everett CAN act, although in this film his acting skills have been put to one side, and he becomes the most boring person ever. Thirdly, this film escalates in strange ways to situations that are just not plausible. I get it that it is a zombie film, but I enjoy aspects of realism in zombie films, and this has none. I can keep going on, but to summarise my criticism - the script is absolutely dire, the acting is terrible all round (not just Ruper Everett), the storyline is ridiculous and the zombies look rubbish. This film has been called "funny", "a masterpiece" etc. It is none of these. It really is just a boring, dire movie. If Rupert Everett wasn't in it, it would never have received any recognition at all. It reminds me of the absolutely interminable "City Of The Dead"by Lucio Fulci. I have always thought that Lucio Fulci is possibly one of the worst directors ever (worse than Uwe Boll in my eyes), but this film seems to be as bad as his works. Michele Soavi should be ashamed of himself.

    This movie is incredibly slow paced all the way trough I was tempted to put it on fast forward... The acting for the most part is really poor. The dialogues are uninteresting and poorly constructed. But the beginning and ending monologues are really interesting and make the movie a whole lot better than it would have been without. There are quite few original turn and twist to this movie (the flying zombie head my oh my that was a lot of fun and completely unexpected for me), some of the zombies make use of basic logic and it can be quite interesting. The characters are all somewhat insane and make for few laugh... I gave this movie a 5 only because I still wonder if I liked it or not the best I can say is watch it and find out for yourself as this movie made hi itself a little place amongst the cult zombie movies it cant be a total waste of your time to watch it.

    Imagine you have a choice. You can either have your teeth knocked out with a hammer and rusty chisel, or watch this movie. Having seen this movie, I'd choose getting my teeth pounded out. I would get more out of it than anything this movie can offer. This movie is nothing but a mish-mash of unrelated nonsense. You may dig it if you are into necro-porn. "Death Bed: The Bed that Eats" is better than this. "Manimal" is better than this. "Stroker Ace" is better than this. "Megaforce" is better than this. Every movie ever made is better than this. Don't waste your time. If you're bored, chew on some tinfoil or try to drill into your own head without killing yourself. It'll be more fun and make more sense.

    This movie was another sci-fiction/horror stinker that I rented based on the reviews that I read on this site! Buyer Beware! There is no sense to this movie. It is another strange foreign film. I can't compare it to anything that I have seen before but if you are the type of viewer that likes your movies to have a plot or a point than do not rent this movie. I would say, in summary, that it is a French or Italian art film with some zombies in it. Good acting.......no logic, no plot, incoherent. I don't get what so many of the reviewers saw in this movie. My kind of zombie movies are not that hard to please me. Night of the living Dead, Dawn of the Dead. Day of the Dead, Return of the Living Dead are all fine examples of great zombie movies. They don't require a lot of special effects, great acting or much at at all...just have a plot and make sense. I guess that this movie was supposed to be a comedy but I did not think that it was funny. I guess that the humor was supposed to be ironic or coy. The ending was also a stinker. I just didn't get it. Forgive my simple tastes!

Let's call her She (the ravishingly beautiful Anna Falchi) who loves getting naked and having sex with Francesco. Even after death. And also after death after death. And than again after death after death after death. And Death is also at the party. And walking dead high on mandragora. Boyscout zombies all inclusive. All a very yummy wacky cocktail, which makes for a surreal hybrid of David Lynch, Monty Python and early Peter Jackson. But you would be mistaken that the plot of the movie is wacky fun deep. Actually beneath the gory zombie killing, eye-catching nudity and witty dark absurd humour the author of this movie actually has something to say with a very interesting comment of human life punctuated with a surreal, slightly unexpected but surprisingly intelligent ending. Additionally the cinematography is exceptional - heavily indebted to the Italian horror school - which makes the film hit even harder into memory. This is also a coming of age movie for Dario Argento's protegee, Michele Soavi. A very underrated movie which requires rewatching to fully catch the drift of the movie. A movie that goes much deeper than it B-movie cover would suggest - essentially it's a slightly silly, but brilliant tractate about life and death.
