    It's the story of a serial killer the police is trying to find and who also kidnapped the son of a FBI agent (Dennis Quaid)to challenge him. I didn't mind this movie because it has a good pace and the story is well developed. The setting is also nice being Colorado, with its snowy mountains and its long highways. The chasing scene on the train is also gripping and catching. The actors Dennis Quaid, Jared Leto and Danny Glover, who I've always used to think of as the policeman who's made fun of in Lethal Weapon, is credible in his role. However I give a 6 to this movie because it doesn't have that touch in the plot and in the action scenes that make it more than an average thriller.

    It's not something that Quaid or Glover would want to buy back and destroy every copy but it's not very good either. Quaid has one constipated expression all through the film as does Leto. They obviously needed the paycheck. Glover, to be fair, hammed it up, had fun and it kept me from changing to something else. But the entire plot was bad - and even the chases were dull lacking any excitement, the contrived "surprise" was revealed too early - and nothing makes much sense. Just a bunch of scenes strung together to fill the time. No humor or decent FX/explosions ala Lethal Weapon to distract from a boring story either. Very meh - Predator 2 was better...

    This is one of my favorite movies. A very menacing storyline if you pay attention. Danny Glover is fully believable in the role of a serial killer, Bob Goodall. His eyes and smile convey an extreme homicidal persona one second, but just friendly and laid back the next. I have never seen any actor portray this kind of character as well as Mr. Glover. One of the most convincing scenes is when he follows the attractive female clerk into the store room of a country store. His demeanor, very understated, reflects a trusted friend until he enters the room and says a few words to her and his facial expression, still subdued, completely changes in an instant, going from friend to most dangerous. Hard to describe, but his acting was superb as a psychopath and I recommend this movie.

    I mostly liked "Switchback", but the last half hour or so seemed kind of anticlimactic, as if suddenly the truth gets revealed and then nothing more can happen. Granted, they did have a lot of tricks up to that point, but I still would have preferred a bigger surprise at the end. Nevertheless, Dennis Quaid, Danny Glover, Jared Leto and R. Lee Ermey do well in their roles. I kind of wish that more movies took place in the Rocky Mountains region (the most famous one is "The Shining", but another good one is "Sunshine Cleaning"). Anyway, an OK movie, but I would have preferred a stronger ending. PS: Maggie Roswell, who plays Fae, is best known as one of the voices on "The Simpsons".

    I come to fully realize now, that while I find 'Switchback' to be an enjoyable and watchable movie, it is also not very convincing and many things about the film are poorly done. Namely, the screenplay itself remains unconvincing to the end. It was like the script was written in two days with haste, and then delivered to the studio, and without any rewrites to try to tie up any loose ends that the film might have, they just went on ahead and made the film anyway. I feel like Jeb Stuart was in love with his idea from the start, and didn't care about how little sense it made at the time, he just acted like he was Kerouac pounding on his typewriter in the midst of writing "On The Road", and published the story intact with errors and inconsistencies abound. The story itself has a nice feel to it, our characters are mostly pretty likable people, and the locale of the story is probably the best thing about it. It makes you feel for the traveling soul, puts you in their disposition, and makes you feel right at home. The snowy mountains sure do look nice on camera, but this doesn't save the movie from being completely just LACKING in the story department. The tone of the film is good, but the pacing is just all wrong. It feels entirely too rushed, and maybe if Jeb Stuart had just sat on this idea just a little bit longer, and maybe rewritten the screenplay a few times, he could have had something really spectacular on his hands. Dennis Quaid is a good actor, in my opinion. I know he is really just an A-list actor with a B-movie star personality, but I generally enjoy his characters, because he never gets too carried away with it. Danny Glover and Jared Leto are the real centerpieces of the action here, and they play off of one another nicely, and I would say it is them with a little help from R. Lee Ermey that save this movie from being a complete waste of time. Ted Levine and William Fichtner are basically just wasted talent here. There is suspense present for the most part, but the identity of the killer is revealed far too quickly, and we are dragged along with the burden of knowing who it is, when Jeb Stuart could have just left that part out completely because it is mostly irrelevant to what happens in the film for the next hour. The ending of the film again, it looks really nice. The cinematography is admirable, but the story is just extremely anti-climactic. Somehow, the film retains it's personality throughout, and it stands as a watchable flick. Entertaining? Yes. Good? Not really. SWITCHBACK -----6/10.

It's a good movie with some great performances from the cast, but if you have common sense, you should know that Glover is the killer from the start because such a prolific actor wouldn't be in a role where the character has no real meaning in the film. He only picks up Leto, and thats his part in the narration of the film, and acting like an old school cowboy, I would have been very surprised if he were innocent. But despite that flaw, it's quite a tense film, with lots of beautiful locale, and red herrings. Quaid lets the side down a little, if only for the fact that he has an expression of 'no toilet for the next 20 miles' on his face. When Glover and Leto are on screen, the film is full of energy, and this is the problem too, the film seems dull and lifeless when they are absent. But all in all its a good effort, but never challenging, thanks to advertising and Glover playing the obvious choice for guess the killer.

    Formally a thriller, this film is in fact a rather substantive morality play about the price of integrity. Everyone in the film is called upon to make a moral choice that reflects who and what they are. And choosing has a price. Sheriff Olmstead played masterfully by R. Lee Ermey--once observes that "He--FBI agent Frank La Crosse--told the truth, and once you tell the truth, everything else is just cheap whiskey." Olmstead's observation pretty much sums up the film. Virtue is good whiskey. Laughably, Ermey delivers this line spot on with a bottle of Jim Beam--definitely not good whiskey--in the background. Olmsteads's integrity costs him the sheriff's election. His elective replacement, Chief McGinnis, played by William Fichtner, initially comes across as a pompous ass: but even he makes a virtuous choice that eventually costs him. Jared Leto who plays Lane Dixon, a burned out physician who strangely bonds with the killer, is another case of self-discovery through moral agency. Even Bob Goodall--a.k.a Danny Glover--the clearly insane serial killer, has a kind of warped integrity. Twisted, yes; but true to his "twistedness". FBI agent La Crosse's observation that the killer, Bob Goodall--the name is hardly accidental--may be a murderer but is not a liar simply underscores the film's larger Stoic themes. As Epictetus put it: "Be one man, bad or good." This film, written and directed by Jeb Stuart should have received more critical attention. It is a thoughtful and philosophically reflective film that paid a price for its quirky moral subtext and integrity: it flopped at the box office. Philosophical films, even subdued ones, are generally not money makers--even with decent writing such as this and a popular genre that should have been an appropriate vehicle for its message. However, even for an unreflective viewer this is an entertaining film directed and written by the same guy--Jeb Stuart--who wrote the screenplays for "Die Hard" and "The Fugitive".

    Switchback is really a zig-zag journey with lots of action. Altogether in the beginning there are three persons who could be the potential killer(s) plus one undefined imaginative possible killer. The atmosphere and locales (scenery, etc.) are very well selected and the acting by the main characters is pretty good for a film like this. There are a lot of surprises and the ending really ties everything nicely together as this movie has a solid beginning, a well-rounded middle and a breathtaking finale. It's really a well-made movie and perhaps one of the best thrillers in this genre ever made. The editors also did a fabulous job as did the cinematographer, ... really cool shots and excellent cut. Most viewers will want to see this movie a couple of times or even several times as there's so much detail that most minds won't perceive all the great little details at the first viewing and these details really flesh out the texture of the film. Switchback is well worth watching and it has a good soundtrack too. Too bad it has been overlooked and it's a much underrated movie.

    I guess critics feel they have to criticize. Must be fun looking for flaws rather than enjoying a movie for what it is...a movie! If everyone did this, there'd be no James Bond, no Tarzan, no Lethal Weapon series, no Die Hard series and many more. Getting back to the subject at hand, "Switchback" is an extremely tense, terrific action film and is much like a ride on a roller-coaster. The cast is fine. Danny Glover as a villain, R. Lee Ermey as always dependable, Jared Leto in one of his best roles, Dennis Quaid good in the lead role and all the others in the cast were very good. The action stunts were great and I'm sure they used miniatures in the train scenes but they looked flawless. Basil Poledouris' score was effective. The script was fun and come on you gotta use a little imagination too. Sure there were a few loose ends but all in all this movie entertains and what more do you want, a social message or a Disney feeling? Come on people, quit looking for errors and enjoy the thing for what it is...entertainment.

Virtue is good whiskey. Laughably, Ermey delivers this line spot on with a bottle of Jim Beam--definitely not good whiskey--in the background. Olmsteads's integrity costs him the sheriff's election. His elective replacement, Chief McGinnis, played by William Fichtner, initially comes across as a pompous ass: but even he makes a virtuous choice that eventually costs him. Jared Leto who plays Lane Dixon, a burned out physician who strangely bonds with the killer, is another case of self-discovery through moral agency. Even Bob Goodall--a.k.a Danny Glover--the clearly insane serial killer, has a kind of warped integrity. Twisted, yes; but true to his "twistedness". FBI agent La Crosse's observation that the killer, Bob Goodall--the name is hardly accidental--may be a murderer but is not a liar simply underscores the film's larger Stoic themes. As Epictetus put it: "Be one man, bad or good." This film, written and directed by Jeb Stuart should have received more critical attention. It is a thoughtful and philosophically reflective film that paid a price for its quirky moral subtext and integrity: it flopped at the box office. Philosophical films, even subdued ones, are generally not money makers--even with decent writing such as this and a popular genre that should have been an appropriate vehicle for its message. However, even for an unreflective viewer this is an entertaining film directed and written by the same guy--Jeb Stuart--who wrote the screenplays for "Die Hard" and "The Fugitive".

    Switchback is really a zig-zag journey with lots of action. Altogether in the beginning there are three persons who could be the potential killer(s) plus one undefined imaginative possible killer. The atmosphere and locales (scenery, etc.) are very well selected and the acting by the main characters is pretty good for a film like this. There are a lot of surprises and the ending really ties everything nicely together as this movie has a solid beginning, a well-rounded middle and a breathtaking finale. It's really a well-made movie and perhaps one of the best thrillers in this genre ever made. The editors also did a fabulous job as did the cinematographer, ... really cool shots and excellent cut. Most viewers will want to see this movie a couple of times or even several times as there's so much detail that most minds won't perceive all the great little details at the first viewing and these details really flesh out the texture of the film. Switchback is well worth watching and it has a good soundtrack too. Too bad it has been overlooked and it's a much underrated movie.

    I guess critics feel they have to criticize. Must be fun looking for flaws rather than enjoying a movie for what it is...a movie! If everyone did this, there'd be no James Bond, no Tarzan, no Lethal Weapon series, no Die Hard series and many more. Getting back to the subject at hand, "Switchback" is an extremely tense, terrific action film and is much like a ride on a roller-coaster. The cast is fine. Danny Glover as a villain, R. Lee Ermey as always dependable, Jared Leto in one of his best roles, Dennis Quaid good in the lead role and all the others in the cast were very good. The action stunts were great and I'm sure they used miniatures in the train scenes but they looked flawless. Basil Poledouris' score was effective. The script was fun and come on you gotta use a little imagination too. Sure there were a few loose ends but all in all this movie entertains and what more do you want, a social message or a Disney feeling? Come on people, quit looking for errors and enjoy the thing for what it is...entertainment.

    It's the story of a serial killer the police is trying to find and who also kidnapped the son of a FBI agent (Dennis Quaid)to challenge him. I didn't mind this movie because it has a good pace and the story is well developed. The setting is also nice being Colorado, with its snowy mountains and its long highways. The chasing scene on the train is also gripping and catching. The actors Dennis Quaid, Jared Leto and Danny Glover, who I've always used to think of as the policeman who's made fun of in Lethal Weapon, is credible in his role. However I give a 6 to this movie because it doesn't have that touch in the plot and in the action scenes that make it more than an average thriller.

    It's not something that Quaid or Glover would want to buy back and destroy every copy but it's not very good either. Quaid has one constipated expression all through the film as does Leto. They obviously needed the paycheck. Glover, to be fair, hammed it up, had fun and it kept me from changing to something else. But the entire plot was bad - and even the chases were dull lacking any excitement, the contrived "surprise" was revealed too early - and nothing makes much sense. Just a bunch of scenes strung together to fill the time. No humor or decent FX/explosions ala Lethal Weapon to distract from a boring story either. Very meh - Predator 2 was better...

    This is one of my favorite movies. A very menacing storyline if you pay attention. Danny Glover is fully believable in the role of a serial killer, Bob Goodall. His eyes and smile convey an extreme homicidal persona one second, but just friendly and laid back the next. I have never seen any actor portray this kind of character as well as Mr. Glover. One of the most convincing scenes is when he follows the attractive female clerk into the store room of a country store. His demeanor, very understated, reflects a trusted friend until he enters the room and says a few words to her and his facial expression, still subdued, completely changes in an instant, going from friend to most dangerous. Hard to describe, but his acting was superb as a psychopath and I recommend this movie.

    I mostly liked "Switchback", but the last half hour or so seemed kind of anticlimactic, as if suddenly the truth gets revealed and then nothing more can happen. Granted, they did have a lot of tricks up to that point, but I still would have preferred a bigger surprise at the end. Nevertheless, Dennis Quaid, Danny Glover, Jared Leto and R. Lee Ermey do well in their roles. I kind of wish that more movies took place in the Rocky Mountains region (the most famous one is "The Shining", but another good one is "Sunshine Cleaning"). Anyway, an OK movie, but I would have preferred a stronger ending. PS: Maggie Roswell, who plays Fae, is best known as one of the voices on "The Simpsons".

    I come to fully realize now, that while I find 'Switchback' to be an enjoyable and watchable movie, it is also not very convincing and many things about the film are poorly done. Namely, the screenplay itself remains unconvincing to the end. It was like the script was written in two days with haste, and then delivered to the studio, and without any rewrites to try to tie up any loose ends that the film might have, they just went on ahead and made the film anyway. I feel like Jeb Stuart was in love with his idea from the start, and didn't care about how little sense it made at the time, he just acted like he was Kerouac pounding on his typewriter in the midst of writing "On The Road", and published the story intact with errors and inconsistencies abound. The story itself has a nice feel to it, our characters are mostly pretty likable people, and the locale of the story is probably the best thing about it. It makes you feel for the traveling soul, puts you in their disposition, and makes you feel right at home. The snowy mountains sure do look nice on camera, but this doesn't save the movie from being completely just LACKING in the story department. The tone of the film is good, but the pacing is just all wrong. It feels entirely too rushed, and maybe if Jeb Stuart had just sat on this idea just a little bit longer, and maybe rewritten the screenplay a few times, he could have had something really spectacular on his hands. Dennis Quaid is a good actor, in my opinion. I know he is really just an A-list actor with a B-movie star personality, but I generally enjoy his characters, because he never gets too carried away with it. Danny Glover and Jared Leto are the real centerpieces of the action here, and they play off of one another nicely, and I would say it is them with a little help from R. Lee Ermey that save this movie from being a complete waste of time. Ted Levine and William Fichtner are basically just wasted talent here. There is suspense present for the most part, but the identity of the killer is revealed far too quickly, and we are dragged along with the burden of knowing who it is, when Jeb Stuart could have just left that part out completely because it is mostly irrelevant to what happens in the film for the next hour. The ending of the film again, it looks really nice. The cinematography is admirable, but the story is just extremely anti-climactic. Somehow, the film retains it's personality throughout, and it stands as a watchable flick. Entertaining? Yes. Good? Not really. SWITCHBACK -----6/10.

    F.B.I. agent Frank LaCrosse returns home to find his home has been broken into, his son is missing and Missy the babysitter is lying in a pool of her own blood. Her murder being the hallmarks of a elusive enigmatic serial killer whose slaughter spree stretches nearly two years. Frank's desperate pursuit leads to Amarillo, Texas, where two more victims matching the killers M.O. have been found slashed to death. As Frank searches for his suspect the local Sheriff Buck Olmstead and his Deputy Nate Booker investigate the killings in-between a heated election feud, with his competition police chief Jack McGinnis. All the while drifting former doctor Lane Dixon is picked up by ex-railroad man, Bob Goodall. As a local Mechanic, Clyde 'Shorty' Callahan becomes the latest victim. Frank hopes and prays to find this sociopath before he disappears perhaps forever into the rocky mountains... It's a good movie with some great performances from the cast, but if you have common sense, you should know that Glover is the killer from the start because such a prolific actor wouldn't be in a role where the character has no real meaning in the film. He only picks up Leto, and thats his part in the narration of the film, and acting like an old school cowboy, I would have been very surprised if he were innocent. But despite that flaw, it's quite a tense film, with lots of beautiful locale, and red herrings. Quaid lets the side down a little, if only for the fact that he has an expression of 'no toilet for the next 20 miles' on his face. When Glover and Leto are on screen, the film is full of energy, and this is the problem too, the film seems dull and lifeless when they are absent. But all in all its a good effort, but never challenging, thanks to advertising and Glover playing the obvious choice for guess the killer.

    Formally a thriller, this film is in fact a rather substantive morality play about the price of integrity. Everyone in the film is called upon to make a moral choice that reflects who and what they are. And choosing has a price. Sheriff Olmstead played masterfully by R. Lee Ermey--once observes that "He--FBI agent Frank La Crosse--told the truth, and once you tell the truth, everything else is just cheap whiskey." Olmstead's observation pretty much sums up the film. Virtue is good whiskey. Laughably, Ermey delivers this line spot on with a bottle of Jim Beam--definitely not good whiskey--in the background. Olmsteads's integrity costs him the sheriff's election. His elective replacement, Chief McGinnis, played by William Fichtner, initially comes across as a pompous ass: but even he makes a virtuous choice that eventually costs him. Jared Leto who plays Lane Dixon, a burned out physician who strangely bonds with the killer, is another case of self-discovery through moral agency. Even Bob Goodall--a.k.a Danny Glover--the clearly insane serial killer, has a kind of warped integrity. Twisted, yes; but true to his "twistedness". FBI agent La Crosse's observation that the killer, Bob Goodall--the name is hardly accidental--may be a murderer but is not a liar simply underscores the film's larger Stoic themes. As Epictetus put it: "Be one man, bad or good." This film, written and directed by Jeb Stuart should have received more critical attention. It is a thoughtful and philosophically reflective film that paid a price for its quirky moral subtext and integrity: it flopped at the box office. Philosophical films, even subdued ones, are generally not money makers--even with decent writing such as this and a popular genre that should have been an appropriate vehicle for its message. However, even for an unreflective viewer this is an entertaining film directed and written by the same guy--Jeb Stuart--who wrote the screenplays for "Die Hard" and "The Fugitive".

All the while drifting former doctor Lane Dixon is picked up by ex-railroad man, Bob Goodall. As a local Mechanic, Clyde 'Shorty' Callahan becomes the latest victim. Frank hopes and prays to find this sociopath before he disappears perhaps forever into the rocky mountains... It's a good movie with some great performances from the cast, but if you have common sense, you should know that Glover is the killer from the start because such a prolific actor wouldn't be in a role where the character has no real meaning in the film. He only picks up Leto, and thats his part in the narration of the film, and acting like an old school cowboy, I would have been very surprised if he were innocent. But despite that flaw, it's quite a tense film, with lots of beautiful locale, and red herrings. Quaid lets the side down a little, if only for the fact that he has an expression of 'no toilet for the next 20 miles' on his face. When Glover and Leto are on screen, the film is full of energy, and this is the problem too, the film seems dull and lifeless when they are absent. But all in all its a good effort, but never challenging, thanks to advertising and Glover playing the obvious choice for guess the killer.

    Formally a thriller, this film is in fact a rather substantive morality play about the price of integrity. Everyone in the film is called upon to make a moral choice that reflects who and what they are. And choosing has a price. Sheriff Olmstead played masterfully by R. Lee Ermey--once observes that "He--FBI agent Frank La Crosse--told the truth, and once you tell the truth, everything else is just cheap whiskey." Olmstead's observation pretty much sums up the film. Virtue is good whiskey. Laughably, Ermey delivers this line spot on with a bottle of Jim Beam--definitely not good whiskey--in the background. Olmsteads's integrity costs him the sheriff's election. His elective replacement, Chief McGinnis, played by William Fichtner, initially comes across as a pompous ass: but even he makes a virtuous choice that eventually costs him. Jared Leto who plays Lane Dixon, a burned out physician who strangely bonds with the killer, is another case of self-discovery through moral agency. Even Bob Goodall--a.k.a Danny Glover--the clearly insane serial killer, has a kind of warped integrity. Twisted, yes; but true to his "twistedness". FBI agent La Crosse's observation that the killer, Bob Goodall--the name is hardly accidental--may be a murderer but is not a liar simply underscores the film's larger Stoic themes. As Epictetus put it: "Be one man, bad or good." This film, written and directed by Jeb Stuart should have received more critical attention. It is a thoughtful and philosophically reflective film that paid a price for its quirky moral subtext and integrity: it flopped at the box office. Philosophical films, even subdued ones, are generally not money makers--even with decent writing such as this and a popular genre that should have been an appropriate vehicle for its message. However, even for an unreflective viewer this is an entertaining film directed and written by the same guy--Jeb Stuart--who wrote the screenplays for "Die Hard" and "The Fugitive".

    Switchback is really a zig-zag journey with lots of action. Altogether in the beginning there are three persons who could be the potential killer(s) plus one undefined imaginative possible killer. The atmosphere and locales (scenery, etc.) are very well selected and the acting by the main characters is pretty good for a film like this. There are a lot of surprises and the ending really ties everything nicely together as this movie has a solid beginning, a well-rounded middle and a breathtaking finale. It's really a well-made movie and perhaps one of the best thrillers in this genre ever made. The editors also did a fabulous job as did the cinematographer, ... really cool shots and excellent cut. Most viewers will want to see this movie a couple of times or even several times as there's so much detail that most minds won't perceive all the great little details at the first viewing and these details really flesh out the texture of the film. Switchback is well worth watching and it has a good soundtrack too. Too bad it has been overlooked and it's a much underrated movie.

    I guess critics feel they have to criticize. Must be fun looking for flaws rather than enjoying a movie for what it is...a movie! If everyone did this, there'd be no James Bond, no Tarzan, no Lethal Weapon series, no Die Hard series and many more. Getting back to the subject at hand, "Switchback" is an extremely tense, terrific action film and is much like a ride on a roller-coaster. The cast is fine. Danny Glover as a villain, R. Lee Ermey as always dependable, Jared Leto in one of his best roles, Dennis Quaid good in the lead role and all the others in the cast were very good. The action stunts were great and I'm sure they used miniatures in the train scenes but they looked flawless. Basil Poledouris' score was effective. The script was fun and come on you gotta use a little imagination too. Sure there were a few loose ends but all in all this movie entertains and what more do you want, a social message or a Disney feeling? Come on people, quit looking for errors and enjoy the thing for what it is...entertainment.

    It's the story of a serial killer the police is trying to find and who also kidnapped the son of a FBI agent (Dennis Quaid)to challenge him. I didn't mind this movie because it has a good pace and the story is well developed. The setting is also nice being Colorado, with its snowy mountains and its long highways. The chasing scene on the train is also gripping and catching. The actors Dennis Quaid, Jared Leto and Danny Glover, who I've always used to think of as the policeman who's made fun of in Lethal Weapon, is credible in his role. However I give a 6 to this movie because it doesn't have that touch in the plot and in the action scenes that make it more than an average thriller.

    It's not something that Quaid or Glover would want to buy back and destroy every copy but it's not very good either. Quaid has one constipated expression all through the film as does Leto. They obviously needed the paycheck. Glover, to be fair, hammed it up, had fun and it kept me from changing to something else. But the entire plot was bad - and even the chases were dull lacking any excitement, the contrived "surprise" was revealed too early - and nothing makes much sense. Just a bunch of scenes strung together to fill the time. No humor or decent FX/explosions ala Lethal Weapon to distract from a boring story either. Very meh - Predator 2 was better...

    This is one of my favorite movies. A very menacing storyline if you pay attention. Danny Glover is fully believable in the role of a serial killer, Bob Goodall. His eyes and smile convey an extreme homicidal persona one second, but just friendly and laid back the next. I have never seen any actor portray this kind of character as well as Mr. Glover. One of the most convincing scenes is when he follows the attractive female clerk into the store room of a country store. His demeanor, very understated, reflects a trusted friend until he enters the room and says a few words to her and his facial expression, still subdued, completely changes in an instant, going from friend to most dangerous. Hard to describe, but his acting was superb as a psychopath and I recommend this movie.

    I mostly liked "Switchback", but the last half hour or so seemed kind of anticlimactic, as if suddenly the truth gets revealed and then nothing more can happen. Granted, they did have a lot of tricks up to that point, but I still would have preferred a bigger surprise at the end. Nevertheless, Dennis Quaid, Danny Glover, Jared Leto and R. Lee Ermey do well in their roles. I kind of wish that more movies took place in the Rocky Mountains region (the most famous one is "The Shining", but another good one is "Sunshine Cleaning"). Anyway, an OK movie, but I would have preferred a stronger ending. PS: Maggie Roswell, who plays Fae, is best known as one of the voices on "The Simpsons".

    I come to fully realize now, that while I find 'Switchback' to be an enjoyable and watchable movie, it is also not very convincing and many things about the film are poorly done. Namely, the screenplay itself remains unconvincing to the end. It was like the script was written in two days with haste, and then delivered to the studio, and without any rewrites to try to tie up any loose ends that the film might have, they just went on ahead and made the film anyway. I feel like Jeb Stuart was in love with his idea from the start, and didn't care about how little sense it made at the time, he just acted like he was Kerouac pounding on his typewriter in the midst of writing "On The Road", and published the story intact with errors and inconsistencies abound. The story itself has a nice feel to it, our characters are mostly pretty likable people, and the locale of the story is probably the best thing about it. It makes you feel for the traveling soul, puts you in their disposition, and makes you feel right at home. The snowy mountains sure do look nice on camera, but this doesn't save the movie from being completely just LACKING in the story department. The tone of the film is good, but the pacing is just all wrong. It feels entirely too rushed, and maybe if Jeb Stuart had just sat on this idea just a little bit longer, and maybe rewritten the screenplay a few times, he could have had something really spectacular on his hands. Dennis Quaid is a good actor, in my opinion. I know he is really just an A-list actor with a B-movie star personality, but I generally enjoy his characters, because he never gets too carried away with it. Danny Glover and Jared Leto are the real centerpieces of the action here, and they play off of one another nicely, and I would say it is them with a little help from R. Lee Ermey that save this movie from being a complete waste of time. Ted Levine and William Fichtner are basically just wasted talent here. There is suspense present for the most part, but the identity of the killer is revealed far too quickly, and we are dragged along with the burden of knowing who it is, when Jeb Stuart could have just left that part out completely because it is mostly irrelevant to what happens in the film for the next hour. The ending of the film again, it looks really nice. The cinematography is admirable, but the story is just extremely anti-climactic. Somehow, the film retains it's personality throughout, and it stands as a watchable flick. Entertaining? Yes. Good? Not really. SWITCHBACK -----6/10.

    F.B.I. agent Frank LaCrosse returns home to find his home has been broken into, his son is missing and Missy the babysitter is lying in a pool of her own blood. Her murder being the hallmarks of a elusive enigmatic serial killer whose slaughter spree stretches nearly two years. Frank's desperate pursuit leads to Amarillo, Texas, where two more victims matching the killers M.O. have been found slashed to death. As Frank searches for his suspect the local Sheriff Buck Olmstead and his Deputy Nate Booker investigate the killings in-between a heated election feud, with his competition police chief Jack McGinnis. All the while drifting former doctor Lane Dixon is picked up by ex-railroad man, Bob Goodall. As a local Mechanic, Clyde 'Shorty' Callahan becomes the latest victim.

But despite that flaw, it's quite a tense film, with lots of beautiful locale, and red herrings. Quaid lets the side down a little, if only for the fact that he has an expression of 'no toilet for the next 20 miles' on his face. When Glover and Leto are on screen, the film is full of energy, and this is the problem too, the film seems dull and lifeless when they are absent. But all in all its a good effort, but never challenging, thanks to advertising and Glover playing the obvious choice for guess the killer.

I know he is really just an A-list actor with a B-movie star personality, but I generally enjoy his characters, because he never gets too carried away with it. Danny Glover and Jared Leto are the real centerpieces of the action here, and they play off of one another nicely, and I would say it is them with a little help from R. Lee Ermey that save this movie from being a complete waste of time. Ted Levine and William Fichtner are basically just wasted talent here. There is suspense present for the most part, but the identity of the killer is revealed far too quickly, and we are dragged along with the burden of knowing who it is, when Jeb Stuart could have just left that part out completely because it is mostly irrelevant to what happens in the film for the next hour. The ending of the film again, it looks really nice. The cinematography is admirable, but the story is just extremely anti-climactic. Somehow, the film retains it's personality throughout, and it stands as a watchable flick. Entertaining? Yes. Good? Not really. SWITCHBACK -----6/10.

    F.B.I. agent Frank LaCrosse returns home to find his home has been broken into, his son is missing and Missy the babysitter is lying in a pool of her own blood. Her murder being the hallmarks of a elusive enigmatic serial killer whose slaughter spree stretches nearly two years. Frank's desperate pursuit leads to Amarillo, Texas, where two more victims matching the killers M.O. have been found slashed to death. As Frank searches for his suspect the local Sheriff Buck Olmstead and his Deputy Nate Booker investigate the killings in-between a heated election feud, with his competition police chief Jack McGinnis. All the while drifting former doctor Lane Dixon is picked up by ex-railroad man, Bob Goodall. As a local Mechanic, Clyde 'Shorty' Callahan becomes the latest victim. Frank hopes and prays to find this sociopath before he disappears perhaps forever into the rocky mountains... It's a good movie with some great performances from the cast, but if you have common sense, you should know that Glover is the killer from the start because such a prolific actor wouldn't be in a role where the character has no real meaning in the film. He only picks up Leto, and thats his part in the narration of the film, and acting like an old school cowboy, I would have been very surprised if he were innocent. But despite that flaw, it's quite a tense film, with lots of beautiful locale, and red herrings. Quaid lets the side down a little, if only for the fact that he has an expression of 'no toilet for the next 20 miles' on his face. When Glover and Leto are on screen, the film is full of energy, and this is the problem too, the film seems dull and lifeless when they are absent. But all in all its a good effort, but never challenging, thanks to advertising and Glover playing the obvious choice for guess the killer.

    Formally a thriller, this film is in fact a rather substantive morality play about the price of integrity. Everyone in the film is called upon to make a moral choice that reflects who and what they are. And choosing has a price. Sheriff Olmstead played masterfully by R. Lee Ermey--once observes that "He--FBI agent Frank La Crosse--told the truth, and once you tell the truth, everything else is just cheap whiskey." Olmstead's observation pretty much sums up the film. Virtue is good whiskey. Laughably, Ermey delivers this line spot on with a bottle of Jim Beam--definitely not good whiskey--in the background. Olmsteads's integrity costs him the sheriff's election. His elective replacement, Chief McGinnis, played by William Fichtner, initially comes across as a pompous ass: but even he makes a virtuous choice that eventually costs him. Jared Leto who plays Lane Dixon, a burned out physician who strangely bonds with the killer, is another case of self-discovery through moral agency. Even Bob Goodall--a.k.a Danny Glover--the clearly insane serial killer, has a kind of warped integrity. Twisted, yes; but true to his "twistedness". FBI agent La Crosse's observation that the killer, Bob Goodall--the name is hardly accidental--may be a murderer but is not a liar simply underscores the film's larger Stoic themes. As Epictetus put it: "Be one man, bad or good." This film, written and directed by Jeb Stuart should have received more critical attention. It is a thoughtful and philosophically reflective film that paid a price for its quirky moral subtext and integrity: it flopped at the box office. Philosophical films, even subdued ones, are generally not money makers--even with decent writing such as this and a popular genre that should have been an appropriate vehicle for its message. However, even for an unreflective viewer this is an entertaining film directed and written by the same guy--Jeb Stuart--who wrote the screenplays for "Die Hard" and "The Fugitive".

    Switchback is really a zig-zag journey with lots of action. Altogether in the beginning there are three persons who could be the potential killer(s) plus one undefined imaginative possible killer. The atmosphere and locales (scenery, etc.) are very well selected and the acting by the main characters is pretty good for a film like this. There are a lot of surprises and the ending really ties everything nicely together as this movie has a solid beginning, a well-rounded middle and a breathtaking finale. It's really a well-made movie and perhaps one of the best thrillers in this genre ever made. The editors also did a fabulous job as did the cinematographer, ... really cool shots and excellent cut. Most viewers will want to see this movie a couple of times or even several times as there's so much detail that most minds won't perceive all the great little details at the first viewing and these details really flesh out the texture of the film. Switchback is well worth watching and it has a good soundtrack too. Too bad it has been overlooked and it's a much underrated movie.

    I guess critics feel they have to criticize. Must be fun looking for flaws rather than enjoying a movie for what it is...a movie! If everyone did this, there'd be no James Bond, no Tarzan, no Lethal Weapon series, no Die Hard series and many more. Getting back to the subject at hand, "Switchback" is an extremely tense, terrific action film and is much like a ride on a roller-coaster. The cast is fine. Danny Glover as a villain, R. Lee Ermey as always dependable, Jared Leto in one of his best roles, Dennis Quaid good in the lead role and all the others in the cast were very good. The action stunts were great and I'm sure they used miniatures in the train scenes but they looked flawless. Basil Poledouris' score was effective. The script was fun and come on you gotta use a little imagination too. Sure there were a few loose ends but all in all this movie entertains and what more do you want, a social message or a Disney feeling? Come on people, quit looking for errors and enjoy the thing for what it is...entertainment.

    It's the story of a serial killer the police is trying to find and who also kidnapped the son of a FBI agent (Dennis Quaid)to challenge him. I didn't mind this movie because it has a good pace and the story is well developed. The setting is also nice being Colorado, with its snowy mountains and its long highways. The chasing scene on the train is also gripping and catching. The actors Dennis Quaid, Jared Leto and Danny Glover, who I've always used to think of as the policeman who's made fun of in Lethal Weapon, is credible in his role. However I give a 6 to this movie because it doesn't have that touch in the plot and in the action scenes that make it more than an average thriller.

    It's not something that Quaid or Glover would want to buy back and destroy every copy but it's not very good either. Quaid has one constipated expression all through the film as does Leto. They obviously needed the paycheck. Glover, to be fair, hammed it up, had fun and it kept me from changing to something else. But the entire plot was bad - and even the chases were dull lacking any excitement, the contrived "surprise" was revealed too early - and nothing makes much sense. Just a bunch of scenes strung together to fill the time. No humor or decent FX/explosions ala Lethal Weapon to distract from a boring story either. Very meh - Predator 2 was better...

    This is one of my favorite movies. A very menacing storyline if you pay attention. Danny Glover is fully believable in the role of a serial killer, Bob Goodall. His eyes and smile convey an extreme homicidal persona one second, but just friendly and laid back the next. I have never seen any actor portray this kind of character as well as Mr. Glover. One of the most convincing scenes is when he follows the attractive female clerk into the store room of a country store. His demeanor, very understated, reflects a trusted friend until he enters the room and says a few words to her and his facial expression, still subdued, completely changes in an instant, going from friend to most dangerous. Hard to describe, but his acting was superb as a psychopath and I recommend this movie.

    I mostly liked "Switchback", but the last half hour or so seemed kind of anticlimactic, as if suddenly the truth gets revealed and then nothing more can happen. Granted, they did have a lot of tricks up to that point, but I still would have preferred a bigger surprise at the end. Nevertheless, Dennis Quaid, Danny Glover, Jared Leto and R. Lee Ermey do well in their roles. I kind of wish that more movies took place in the Rocky Mountains region (the most famous one is "The Shining", but another good one is "Sunshine Cleaning"). Anyway, an OK movie, but I would have preferred a stronger ending. PS: Maggie Roswell, who plays Fae, is best known as one of the voices on "The Simpsons".

    I come to fully realize now, that while I find 'Switchback' to be an enjoyable and watchable movie, it is also not very convincing and many things about the film are poorly done. Namely, the screenplay itself remains unconvincing to the end. It was like the script was written in two days with haste, and then delivered to the studio, and without any rewrites to try to tie up any loose ends that the film might have, they just went on ahead and made the film anyway. I feel like Jeb Stuart was in love with his idea from the start, and didn't care about how little sense it made at the time, he just acted like he was Kerouac pounding on his typewriter in the midst of writing "On The Road", and published the story intact with errors and inconsistencies abound. The story itself has a nice feel to it, our characters are mostly pretty likable people, and the locale of the story is probably the best thing about it. It makes you feel for the traveling soul, puts you in their disposition, and makes you feel right at home. The snowy mountains sure do look nice on camera, but this doesn't save the movie from being completely just LACKING in the story department. The tone of the film is good, but the pacing is just all wrong. It feels entirely too rushed, and maybe if Jeb Stuart had just sat on this idea just a little bit longer, and maybe rewritten the screenplay a few times, he could have had something really spectacular on his hands. Dennis Quaid is a good actor, in my opinion. I know he is really just an A-list actor with a B-movie star personality, but I generally enjoy his characters, because he never gets too carried away with it. Danny Glover and Jared Leto are the real centerpieces of the action here, and they play off of one another nicely, and I would say it is them with a little help from R. Lee Ermey that save this movie from being a complete waste of time. Ted Levine and William Fichtner are basically just wasted talent here. There is suspense present for the most part, but the identity of the killer is revealed far too quickly, and we are dragged along with the burden of knowing who it is, when Jeb Stuart could have just left that part out completely because it is mostly irrelevant to what happens in the film for the next hour. The ending of the film again, it looks really nice. The cinematography is admirable, but the story is just extremely anti-climactic. Somehow, the film retains it's personality throughout, and it stands as a watchable flick. Entertaining? Yes. Good? Not really. SWITCHBACK -----6/10.

    I come to fully realize now, that while I find 'Switchback' to be an enjoyable and watchable movie, it is also not very convincing and many things about the film are poorly done. Namely, the screenplay itself remains unconvincing to the end. It was like the script was written in two days with haste, and then delivered to the studio, and without any rewrites to try to tie up any loose ends that the film might have, they just went on ahead and made the film anyway. I feel like Jeb Stuart was in love with his idea from the start, and didn't care about how little sense it made at the time, he just acted like he was Kerouac pounding on his typewriter in the midst of writing "On The Road", and published the story intact with errors and inconsistencies abound. The story itself has a nice feel to it, our characters are mostly pretty likable people, and the locale of the story is probably the best thing about it. It makes you feel for the traveling soul, puts you in their disposition, and makes you feel right at home. The snowy mountains sure do look nice on camera, but this doesn't save the movie from being completely just LACKING in the story department. The tone of the film is good, but the pacing is just all wrong. It feels entirely too rushed, and maybe if Jeb Stuart had just sat on this idea just a little bit longer, and maybe rewritten the screenplay a few times, he could have had something really spectacular on his hands. Dennis Quaid is a good actor, in my opinion. I know he is really just an A-list actor with a B-movie star personality, but I generally enjoy his characters, because he never gets too carried away with it. Danny Glover and Jared Leto are the real centerpieces of the action here, and they play off of one another nicely, and I would say it is them with a little help from R. Lee Ermey that save this movie from being a complete waste of time. Ted Levine and William Fichtner are basically just wasted talent here. There is suspense present for the most part, but the identity of the killer is revealed far too quickly, and we are dragged along with the burden of knowing who it is, when Jeb Stuart could have just left that part out completely because it is mostly irrelevant to what happens in the film for the next hour. The ending of the film again, it looks really nice. The cinematography is admirable, but the story is just extremely anti-climactic. Somehow, the film retains it's personality throughout, and it stands as a watchable flick. Entertaining? Yes. Good? Not really. SWITCHBACK -----6/10.

    F.B.I. agent Frank LaCrosse returns home to find his home has been broken into, his son is missing and Missy the babysitter is lying in a pool of her own blood. Her murder being the hallmarks of a elusive enigmatic serial killer whose slaughter spree stretches nearly two years. Frank's desperate pursuit leads to Amarillo, Texas, where two more victims matching the killers M.O. have been found slashed to death. As Frank searches for his suspect the local Sheriff Buck Olmstead and his Deputy Nate Booker investigate the killings in-between a heated election feud, with his competition police chief Jack McGinnis. All the while drifting former doctor Lane Dixon is picked up by ex-railroad man, Bob Goodall. As a local Mechanic, Clyde 'Shorty' Callahan becomes the latest victim. Frank hopes and prays to find this sociopath before he disappears perhaps forever into the rocky mountains... It's a good movie with some great performances from the cast, but if you have common sense, you should know that Glover is the killer from the start because such a prolific actor wouldn't be in a role where the character has no real meaning in the film. He only picks up Leto, and thats his part in the narration of the film, and acting like an old school cowboy, I would have been very surprised if he were innocent. But despite that flaw, it's quite a tense film, with lots of beautiful locale, and red herrings. Quaid lets the side down a little, if only for the fact that he has an expression of 'no toilet for the next 20 miles' on his face. When Glover and Leto are on screen, the film is full of energy, and this is the problem too, the film seems dull and lifeless when they are absent. But all in all its a good effort, but never challenging, thanks to advertising and Glover playing the obvious choice for guess the killer.

    Formally a thriller, this film is in fact a rather substantive morality play about the price of integrity. Everyone in the film is called upon to make a moral choice that reflects who and what they are. And choosing has a price. Sheriff Olmstead played masterfully by R. Lee Ermey--once observes that "He--FBI agent Frank La Crosse--told the truth, and once you tell the truth, everything else is just cheap whiskey." Olmstead's observation pretty much sums up the film. Virtue is good whiskey. Laughably, Ermey delivers this line spot on with a bottle of Jim Beam--definitely not good whiskey--in the background. Olmsteads's integrity costs him the sheriff's election. His elective replacement, Chief McGinnis, played by William Fichtner, initially comes across as a pompous ass: but even he makes a virtuous choice that eventually costs him. Jared Leto who plays Lane Dixon, a burned out physician who strangely bonds with the killer, is another case of self-discovery through moral agency. Even Bob Goodall--a.k.a Danny Glover--the clearly insane serial killer, has a kind of warped integrity. Twisted, yes; but true to his "twistedness". FBI agent La Crosse's observation that the killer, Bob Goodall--the name is hardly accidental--may be a murderer but is not a liar simply underscores the film's larger Stoic themes. As Epictetus put it: "Be one man, bad or good." This film, written and directed by Jeb Stuart should have received more critical attention. It is a thoughtful and philosophically reflective film that paid a price for its quirky moral subtext and integrity: it flopped at the box office. Philosophical films, even subdued ones, are generally not money makers--even with decent writing such as this and a popular genre that should have been an appropriate vehicle for its message. However, even for an unreflective viewer this is an entertaining film directed and written by the same guy--Jeb Stuart--who wrote the screenplays for "Die Hard" and "The Fugitive".

    Switchback is really a zig-zag journey with lots of action. Altogether in the beginning there are three persons who could be the potential killer(s) plus one undefined imaginative possible killer. The atmosphere and locales (scenery, etc.) are very well selected and the acting by the main characters is pretty good for a film like this. There are a lot of surprises and the ending really ties everything nicely together as this movie has a solid beginning, a well-rounded middle and a breathtaking finale. It's really a well-made movie and perhaps one of the best thrillers in this genre ever made. The editors also did a fabulous job as did the cinematographer, ... really cool shots and excellent cut. Most viewers will want to see this movie a couple of times or even several times as there's so much detail that most minds won't perceive all the great little details at the first viewing and these details really flesh out the texture of the film. Switchback is well worth watching and it has a good soundtrack too. Too bad it has been overlooked and it's a much underrated movie.

    I guess critics feel they have to criticize. Must be fun looking for flaws rather than enjoying a movie for what it is...a movie! If everyone did this, there'd be no James Bond, no Tarzan, no Lethal Weapon series, no Die Hard series and many more. Getting back to the subject at hand, "Switchback" is an extremely tense, terrific action film and is much like a ride on a roller-coaster. The cast is fine. Danny Glover as a villain, R. Lee Ermey as always dependable, Jared Leto in one of his best roles, Dennis Quaid good in the lead role and all the others in the cast were very good. The action stunts were great and I'm sure they used miniatures in the train scenes but they looked flawless. Basil Poledouris' score was effective. The script was fun and come on you gotta use a little imagination too. Sure there were a few loose ends but all in all this movie entertains and what more do you want, a social message or a Disney feeling? Come on people, quit looking for errors and enjoy the thing for what it is...entertainment.
