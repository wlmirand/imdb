    This movie had me in tears near the end. However, I wasn't crying tears of sadness...I was crying tears of joy. This movie is a true Disney masterpiece that I grew up watching as a child and I will hold it dear to my heart until the day I die. Through the events and characters within the movie, this film nails the feelings of love, friendship, and sacrifice, and hardships that no other animated movie has ever nailed so perfectly. I commend Don Bluth with his hand in the animation department, as well as the composer on the breathtaking score. The plot, characters, and values portrayed within the film are right on the edge of perfection and quality. Believe me, this film will have you coming back for more,a must-see for the entire family!

    I am in the minority of reviewers that didn't like this movie and I'm still scratching my head as to why. There was nothing heartwarming about this film. In summary, this movie is about Amos, the crazy, trigger happy, red neck maniac, who spends three quarters of the movie trying to hunt and kill a fox named Tod. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what was motivating him to do so. At one point, he even fires at the old woman's car as she's driving it because the fox was in the back seat. The friendship between the two main characters is driven apart when the older hunting dog, Chief, is injured in the process of trying to kill the fox. The hound then swears revenge on the fox...for running for his life? I was really hoping that the bear would have killed Amos and his dog so that the poor fox could get some peace. Instead, the fox saves the two blood thirsty companions and is nearly killed himself by the bear. Even then, Amos still makes another attempt to kill the fox. The movie is supposed to be about a friendship between a fox and a hound that is broken as they grow up and assume their roles as the animals that they are, but I didn't really get a sense of a friendship because they only spent about a minute developing that aspect of the movie. There are also some other characters in the background that don't really move the story much or provide the levity they are supposed to. The music is terrible and Big Momma sounds as though she is improvising the lyrics and melody of the songs. The dialog was really choppy and awkward and did not flow well. I got the sense that this movie was slapped together with bobble gum and scotch tape a few days before it was in theaters. I understand what this movie was attempting to be, but I feel that it failed miserably.

    The Fox and the Hound (1981) *** (out of 4) Another Disney charmer about the unlikely friendship between a fox (voiced by Mickey Rooney) and a hunting dog (voiced by Kurt Russell). The two of them are eventually thought that they're not supposed to get along but this here is challenged when both are in need. THE FOX AND THE HOUND is without a doubt a very charming little film even though the story itself isn't all that original and I think there are a few too many clich&eacute;d characters and jokes throughout. Still, I like the fact that the studio threw in some added social commentary dealing with people who are "supposed" to hate one another even if there's no real reason. I think some of the strongest stuff here are the vocal performances including the wonderful Pearl Bailey who plays Big Mama. I thought she brought a lot of soul to the performance and easily managed to be the best vocal performance. It seems both Rooney and Russell aren't overly popular among Disney fans but I thought both of them were good here. Neither one deserves a place in the Disney Vocal Hall of Fame but they are still fun and share some nice chemistry together. I thought all of the lead characters were quite charming and fun to watch. The fox certainly is the best written of the group but I also enjoyed the older dog and well as the new one in training. The animation was extremely well done and especially during the finale when we're given an excellent fight between the fox, the hound and a bear. The amount of detail in this sequence is just wonderful. With that said, I thought the rest of the characters were quite forgettable and I thought there really weren't enough laughs to really carry the thing. Still, THE FOX AND THE HOUND has enough to where it should keep fans of the genre entertained.

    An honest look at maturing. Childhood friends have their way of disappearing yet under the gun, literally so , returning. Not the warning of doom and gloom as, say, The Black Hole, or the absolutely surrealistic fantasy of Cinderella. But a fine and balanced medium. Disney's supreme animated effort as far as I am concerned. Loyalties remain. Maturity happens. A hunting we will indeed go. But the prey is captures, and precious memories of childhood return and the bitterest and most old school man of the woods is touched. It was once said all is well that ends well. I believe a wise old Englishman said that during the time of Elizabeth the First. Wisely said. **********

    I was on a car trip to Virginia when I first saw this movie. It looked really sad so I wasn't sure if I really wanted to see. Thank god that I saw this film! It's really good. I just learned that this movie was based off a book and it seemed like the most depressing and disturbing summary I've ever read (along with Hunchback of Notre Dame). Well, let's get back to the Disney version. It has some really enjoyable moments when little Copper and Todd played or the woodpecker scenes. They just make me so happy. Some scenes made me sad when Todd had to be let go or the introduction to the movie (you should just skip the first scene and wait until Big Mama gets introduced). I find this movie really good! How could people hate it? The music isn't great. All I remember is "Goodbye May Seem Forever" and it makes me cry. The characters are sub-par. Is Big Mama a girl or a boy? I can't really tell, he just sounds gay. Copper is adorable when he was young, but why did you turn into a giant d- bag when you were older? Vixie has a stale white bread personality. I would hate Amos when he's a real life person. Chief is pretty cool. Todd is one of my favorite characters. He's adorable, innocent, friendly, and tough! Otherwise, I really like this movie! Get a bag of popcorn, a box of tissues, and waterproof mascara in order to enjoy The Fox and the Hound

    Walt Disney Productions wouldn't release another animated feature until the dreaded "Black Cauldron" in 1985, by which point the last of Walt Disney's Nine Old Men (Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston and Wolfgang Reitherman) had departed from the studio (after having worked there since before 1937's "Snow White"), Michael Eisner had taken over the Magic Kingdom, changed the company's name to Walt Disney PICTURES and pushed NEARLY ALL (if not ALL) film credits to the end of their animated features from the aforementioned "Black Cauldron" onwards (all animated Disney productions from before the dawn of Eisner's reign in 1984 ONLY had opening credits and simply ended with "THE END") and brought Disney dangerously close to Rock Bottom. While the film isn't my favorite Disney flick, it's certainly a very sweet charming finale to the good old days at Disney. Especially the bonds between Tod and the Widow Tweed, and, of course, Tod and Copper, themselves ("The Best of Friends" and "Goodbye May Seem Forever" are two of the most poignant songs in the Disney canon, ESPECIALLY the latter, when the Widow Tweed has to reintroduce Tod to the forest). Even the "villains" (if you can even call them that) are actually likable and sympathetic (extremely unusual by Disney standards). Amos Slade the hunter is not your stereotypical "evil hunter" (that character archetype was not established until Percival McLeech in "The Rescuers 2" in 1990). He only hunts for a living and is, incidentally voiced by (and is even drawn to RESEMBLE) Jack Albertson, best known as Grandpa Joe in the original version of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" (this was also one of Albertson's last roles and the last film he starred in to be released prior to his death just a few months later in 1981). Copper's fellow hunting dog, Chief, seems like a bit of a curmudgeon, but is shown to have a heart of gold, when taking to the young Copper (though he does become somewhat jealous when Amos pays more attention to Copper than to him). Did I mention that Chief's voiced by Pat Buttram, who Disney fans will also know as the Sheriff of Nottingham in "Robin Hood" (1973) and Luke, the whiskey-drinking muskrat in "The Rescuers" (1977), and I'll admit, this definitely seems like one of his more serious, sympathetic voice roles for Disney (The Sheriff of Nottingham may have been laughably evil, but he was still a tax-collecting jerk, and, of course, a comedic idiot). It's hard for me to say whether or not Chief should have been killed after the train accidentally ran him over halfway through the film. On one hand, it would be believable that he'd die, as the train was shown to violently strike him off the bridge and send him sprawling onto the rocky waters below (mostly on screen, and much more detailed than Trusty merely being accidentally knocked over by the dogcatcher's wagon skidding to a sudden halt in "Lady and the Tramp" (1955)), and it would've fully justified Copper and Amos temporarily being upset with Tod for some time after the incident. However, Chief seemed somewhat admirable underneath his curmudgeon-like mannerisms (though not quite on par with the aforementioned Trusty in terms of likableness) and so it may be good that he survived (Incidentally, Trusty and Chief would've BOTH ended up dying in their respective films had "executive meddling" as TV Tropes calls it, not decided to spare them, which makes one wonder why they DID kill off some perfectly likable characters in later Disney films such as "The Lion King II: Simba's Pride", "Tarzan" and even "The Princess and the Frog"). Anyways, "The Fox and the Hound" is again, a beautiful goodbye to classic Disney, as (I forgot to mention earlier) even when Disney did recover from the critical disaster of "The Black Cauldron" (with the likes of "The Great Mouse Detective", "Oliver & Company", and, of course, "The Little Mermaid"), Disney animation was never truly the same again. The words "The End" conclude the entire film in a way almost no previous Disney film had done before (except possibly "Bambi" and "The Rescuers"): An audio flashback of young Tod and Copper saying however they'll always be friends forever ("Yeah, forever.") with a soft sweet finale medley blending the aforementioned "Best of Friends" and "Goodbye May Seem Forever" together. Two chimes faintly ding as the following words appear on screen for the final time: The End - Walt Disney Productions. :.)

    Yet it is BY FAR one of the better movies Disney has put out. It's darker than most Disney movies, but has a lot of heart to it. This was probably somewhat of a crossroads for Disney studios. The last of the old animators left with this underrated gem. What I like about it is that the story relies on plot to carry it along and serves as a welcome reminder that audiences don't require some lame pop reference or in-joke every five minutes to sustain their interest. Before Pixar told us all that "you've got a friend in me" in that vexatious voice, Disney had a pair of critters that taught us how to be the best of friends... until you grow up and try to kill each other. Truth be told, it wasn't taboo for animated movies to break your heart before the flicks went ridiculously PC, almost vindictively, to teach a lesson. There were movies with the heaps of torment aimed at a baby, and a child losing its parent. These films weren't sugar-coated, even if they had their moments of ridiculous cuteness that could keep viewers with the feature. The Fox and the Hound is one of those movies that looks all cute and warm, but turns around and GRABS your heart, rips it out of your chest, and stomps rancorously as you're left suffering. It may seem cute to the point of clich&eacute; or pandering, but lessons are taught, and most definitely learned, by the the struggles portrayed on screen. The reality of friendship is a tough thing for kids to understand until they've lost friends and look back on life. The Fox and the Hound is by no means preachy. The message is underneath the surface, no matter what interpretation one has of the meaning behind the film. There is a story for children, to learn about nature, to stare at the adorably cute animals and witness their trials. And there's one for adults, who will remember friendships that got cast aside along the way, about the tragic ironies in life, about people stuck in their ways to their own disadvantage, about bogged down into status quo, be it right or wrong. The story is a trembling, sensitive tale about the realities of life, of friendship, of the way things are, and how we wish it to be. Here, life is not so beautiful, and things do not always have a happy ending--but we are compelled to strive for the best in the end. Characters are unexpectedly sensitive and believable-- Widow Tweed, whose loneliness is tenderly portrayed... Amos Slade, a gruff hunter whose hardened heart is touched by his dogs (his only companions)... ...and of course, the brilliant anthropomorphic cast: Tod, the fox who grows up in innocence believing in a friendship that could last forever-- Copper, the hound dog who realizes that life cannot be as simple as he wishes. What results of such work is a film that is both enjoyable to children and adults.

    I gained some interest in this one. So I picked it up at best buy for 20$. Now, My favorite Disney movie ever is "Bambi". But When I was watching it Half-way through, I thought this was going to beat Bambi. Negatives: Some of the drawings/Animation looks odd. The scenes were it shows the birds chasing the caterpillar throughout the movie, are REALLY pointless and serves no point but to be filler scenes. Positives: The Film is very depressing at times. But in a very powerful way. (especially the ending.) I REALLY like the design of the foxes. Soundtrack is great, The voices are great. Very entertaining. There was a scene where the old lady abandons Todd. This scene made EVERYONE cry. (according to some facebook posts.) when I was watching it, I didn't even drop a tear. But I can see why it's so sad.  Overall: The Fox and the hound made it to NUMBER 2 in my favorite Disney movies. However Bambi is STILL the king.

    WARNING: Show this movie to your children at your own risk! OK, time to get serious. Let me make it quite clear to you web surfers that I am a big fan of Disney films, and cinema in general, but this one I have always disliked. OK, let me make it clear I don't hate it. To be fair, the artwork is decent and the voice acting matches. Even Hollywood legend Mickey Rooney put effort into his role here. But the reason I dislike this movie is because it goes from "cutesy, cuddly and childish" to "dark, terrifying, malicious, sadistic, ferocious...etc." so quickly the kids cannot suspect something is wrong. First you have Tod and Copper playing innocently, promising to be best friends forever then you have them making vicious, growling, faces and trying to bite each other's throats. This whole scene actually scared me as a 4-5 year old to the point where I didn't watch it again for years. I cannot believe scenes like this and the climax still kept the G rating! Does the MPAA just check the poster for the Walt Disney signature and say "Well, it says Disney on it so I guess it means it gets a G rating"? And on top of that, your children will likely learn to fight as brutally as shown in this movie, Disney seems to have no respect for the fact that kids are easily frightened and often repeat what they see. To be honest, I found these scenes very appalling for a G-rated Disney flick, and I was shocked that it's seldom talked about on the internet. I honestly hope I'm not alone in my opinions here. Even my family barely feels sorry for me on this matter, but we are currently considering disposing of the VHS. So if you're a parent looking for good, family fun this isn't it. Try some of Disney's other movies, like Sword in the Stone, Winnie the Pooh or The Lion King. At least the latter was more wholesome, used frightening images sparingly, showed little violence and taught a useful message.

    Many critics have said that The Fox and the Hound is a bit too cute. I have to disagree. While it is mainly a sugarcoated film it has it's dark and intense moments as well. The story revolves around an orphaned baby fox named Tod and his friendship that he forms with a hound dog named Copper who is owned by a hunter who lives nearby. Their friendship seems unbreakable and forever lasting but Tod is warned that Copper will become a trained killer after he goes on a hunting trip. Time passes and Tod wonders if they are still best friends. What happens later on will put their friendship to the ultimate test. The Fox and the Hound has it's ups and downs. The last fifteen minutes of the film shows what finally happens between Tod and Copper. A surprise turn of events unfold. What happens? Watch and find out. This film shows us that even the most unlikeliest of people can become great friends. It also seems to touch on the racism issue. Not long ago black and white people could not be good friends or it brought criticism. This seems to make sense with Tod being a Fox and Copper being a hound. They are supposed to be born enemies but the innocence of youth blinds them to this. Will the friendship last?

He only hunts for a living and is, incidentally voiced by (and is even drawn to RESEMBLE) Jack Albertson, best known as Grandpa Joe in the original version of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" (this was also one of Albertson's last roles and the last film he starred in to be released prior to his death just a few months later in 1981). Copper's fellow hunting dog, Chief, seems like a bit of a curmudgeon, but is shown to have a heart of gold, when taking to the young Copper (though he does become somewhat jealous when Amos pays more attention to Copper than to him). Did I mention that Chief's voiced by Pat Buttram, who Disney fans will also know as the Sheriff of Nottingham in "Robin Hood" (1973) and Luke, the whiskey-drinking muskrat in "The Rescuers" (1977), and I'll admit, this definitely seems like one of his more serious, sympathetic voice roles for Disney (The Sheriff of Nottingham may have been laughably evil, but he was still a tax-collecting jerk, and, of course, a comedic idiot). It's hard for me to say whether or not Chief should have been killed after the train accidentally ran him over halfway through the film. On one hand, it would be believable that he'd die, as the train was shown to violently strike him off the bridge and send him sprawling onto the rocky waters below (mostly on screen, and much more detailed than Trusty merely being accidentally knocked over by the dogcatcher's wagon skidding to a sudden halt in "Lady and the Tramp" (1955)), and it would've fully justified Copper and Amos temporarily being upset with Tod for some time after the incident. However, Chief seemed somewhat admirable underneath his curmudgeon-like mannerisms (though not quite on par with the aforementioned Trusty in terms of likableness) and so it may be good that he survived (Incidentally, Trusty and Chief would've BOTH ended up dying in their respective films had "executive meddling" as TV Tropes calls it, not decided to spare them, which makes one wonder why they DID kill off some perfectly likable characters in later Disney films such as "The Lion King II: Simba's Pride", "Tarzan" and even "The Princess and the Frog"). Anyways, "The Fox and the Hound" is again, a beautiful goodbye to classic Disney, as (I forgot to mention earlier) even when Disney did recover from the critical disaster of "The Black Cauldron" (with the likes of "The Great Mouse Detective", "Oliver & Company", and, of course, "The Little Mermaid"), Disney animation was never truly the same again. The words "The End" conclude the entire film in a way almost no previous Disney film had done before (except possibly "Bambi" and "The Rescuers"): An audio flashback of young Tod and Copper saying however they'll always be friends forever ("Yeah, forever.") with a soft sweet finale medley blending the aforementioned "Best of Friends" and "Goodbye May Seem Forever" together. Two chimes faintly ding as the following words appear on screen for the final time: The End - Walt Disney Productions. :.)

    Yet it is BY FAR one of the better movies Disney has put out. It's darker than most Disney movies, but has a lot of heart to it. This was probably somewhat of a crossroads for Disney studios. The last of the old animators left with this underrated gem. What I like about it is that the story relies on plot to carry it along and serves as a welcome reminder that audiences don't require some lame pop reference or in-joke every five minutes to sustain their interest. Before Pixar told us all that "you've got a friend in me" in that vexatious voice, Disney had a pair of critters that taught us how to be the best of friends... until you grow up and try to kill each other. Truth be told, it wasn't taboo for animated movies to break your heart before the flicks went ridiculously PC, almost vindictively, to teach a lesson. There were movies with the heaps of torment aimed at a baby, and a child losing its parent. These films weren't sugar-coated, even if they had their moments of ridiculous cuteness that could keep viewers with the feature. The Fox and the Hound is one of those movies that looks all cute and warm, but turns around and GRABS your heart, rips it out of your chest, and stomps rancorously as you're left suffering. It may seem cute to the point of clich&eacute; or pandering, but lessons are taught, and most definitely learned, by the the struggles portrayed on screen. The reality of friendship is a tough thing for kids to understand until they've lost friends and look back on life. The Fox and the Hound is by no means preachy. The message is underneath the surface, no matter what interpretation one has of the meaning behind the film. There is a story for children, to learn about nature, to stare at the adorably cute animals and witness their trials. And there's one for adults, who will remember friendships that got cast aside along the way, about the tragic ironies in life, about people stuck in their ways to their own disadvantage, about bogged down into status quo, be it right or wrong. The story is a trembling, sensitive tale about the realities of life, of friendship, of the way things are, and how we wish it to be. Here, life is not so beautiful, and things do not always have a happy ending--but we are compelled to strive for the best in the end. Characters are unexpectedly sensitive and believable-- Widow Tweed, whose loneliness is tenderly portrayed... Amos Slade, a gruff hunter whose hardened heart is touched by his dogs (his only companions)... ...and of course, the brilliant anthropomorphic cast: Tod, the fox who grows up in innocence believing in a friendship that could last forever-- Copper, the hound dog who realizes that life cannot be as simple as he wishes. What results of such work is a film that is both enjoyable to children and adults.

    I gained some interest in this one. So I picked it up at best buy for 20$. Now, My favorite Disney movie ever is "Bambi". But When I was watching it Half-way through, I thought this was going to beat Bambi. Negatives: Some of the drawings/Animation looks odd. The scenes were it shows the birds chasing the caterpillar throughout the movie, are REALLY pointless and serves no point but to be filler scenes. Positives: The Film is very depressing at times. But in a very powerful way. (especially the ending.) I REALLY like the design of the foxes. Soundtrack is great, The voices are great. Very entertaining. There was a scene where the old lady abandons Todd. This scene made EVERYONE cry. (according to some facebook posts.) when I was watching it, I didn't even drop a tear. But I can see why it's so sad.  Overall: The Fox and the hound made it to NUMBER 2 in my favorite Disney movies. However Bambi is STILL the king.

    WARNING: Show this movie to your children at your own risk! OK, time to get serious. Let me make it quite clear to you web surfers that I am a big fan of Disney films, and cinema in general, but this one I have always disliked. OK, let me make it clear I don't hate it. To be fair, the artwork is decent and the voice acting matches. Even Hollywood legend Mickey Rooney put effort into his role here. But the reason I dislike this movie is because it goes from "cutesy, cuddly and childish" to "dark, terrifying, malicious, sadistic, ferocious...etc." so quickly the kids cannot suspect something is wrong. First you have Tod and Copper playing innocently, promising to be best friends forever then you have them making vicious, growling, faces and trying to bite each other's throats. This whole scene actually scared me as a 4-5 year old to the point where I didn't watch it again for years. I cannot believe scenes like this and the climax still kept the G rating! Does the MPAA just check the poster for the Walt Disney signature and say "Well, it says Disney on it so I guess it means it gets a G rating"? And on top of that, your children will likely learn to fight as brutally as shown in this movie, Disney seems to have no respect for the fact that kids are easily frightened and often repeat what they see. To be honest, I found these scenes very appalling for a G-rated Disney flick, and I was shocked that it's seldom talked about on the internet. I honestly hope I'm not alone in my opinions here. Even my family barely feels sorry for me on this matter, but we are currently considering disposing of the VHS. So if you're a parent looking for good, family fun this isn't it. Try some of Disney's other movies, like Sword in the Stone, Winnie the Pooh or The Lion King. At least the latter was more wholesome, used frightening images sparingly, showed little violence and taught a useful message.

    Many critics have said that The Fox and the Hound is a bit too cute. I have to disagree. While it is mainly a sugarcoated film it has it's dark and intense moments as well. The story revolves around an orphaned baby fox named Tod and his friendship that he forms with a hound dog named Copper who is owned by a hunter who lives nearby. Their friendship seems unbreakable and forever lasting but Tod is warned that Copper will become a trained killer after he goes on a hunting trip. Time passes and Tod wonders if they are still best friends. What happens later on will put their friendship to the ultimate test. The Fox and the Hound has it's ups and downs. The last fifteen minutes of the film shows what finally happens between Tod and Copper. A surprise turn of events unfold. What happens? Watch and find out. This film shows us that even the most unlikeliest of people can become great friends. It also seems to touch on the racism issue. Not long ago black and white people could not be good friends or it brought criticism. This seems to make sense with Tod being a Fox and Copper being a hound. They are supposed to be born enemies but the innocence of youth blinds them to this. Will the friendship last?

    This movie had me in tears near the end. However, I wasn't crying tears of sadness...I was crying tears of joy. This movie is a true Disney masterpiece that I grew up watching as a child and I will hold it dear to my heart until the day I die. Through the events and characters within the movie, this film nails the feelings of love, friendship, and sacrifice, and hardships that no other animated movie has ever nailed so perfectly. I commend Don Bluth with his hand in the animation department, as well as the composer on the breathtaking score. The plot, characters, and values portrayed within the film are right on the edge of perfection and quality. Believe me, this film will have you coming back for more,a must-see for the entire family!

    I am in the minority of reviewers that didn't like this movie and I'm still scratching my head as to why. There was nothing heartwarming about this film. In summary, this movie is about Amos, the crazy, trigger happy, red neck maniac, who spends three quarters of the movie trying to hunt and kill a fox named Tod. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what was motivating him to do so. At one point, he even fires at the old woman's car as she's driving it because the fox was in the back seat. The friendship between the two main characters is driven apart when the older hunting dog, Chief, is injured in the process of trying to kill the fox. The hound then swears revenge on the fox...for running for his life? I was really hoping that the bear would have killed Amos and his dog so that the poor fox could get some peace. Instead, the fox saves the two blood thirsty companions and is nearly killed himself by the bear. Even then, Amos still makes another attempt to kill the fox. The movie is supposed to be about a friendship between a fox and a hound that is broken as they grow up and assume their roles as the animals that they are, but I didn't really get a sense of a friendship because they only spent about a minute developing that aspect of the movie. There are also some other characters in the background that don't really move the story much or provide the levity they are supposed to. The music is terrible and Big Momma sounds as though she is improvising the lyrics and melody of the songs. The dialog was really choppy and awkward and did not flow well. I got the sense that this movie was slapped together with bobble gum and scotch tape a few days before it was in theaters. I understand what this movie was attempting to be, but I feel that it failed miserably.

    The Fox and the Hound (1981) *** (out of 4) Another Disney charmer about the unlikely friendship between a fox (voiced by Mickey Rooney) and a hunting dog (voiced by Kurt Russell). The two of them are eventually thought that they're not supposed to get along but this here is challenged when both are in need. THE FOX AND THE HOUND is without a doubt a very charming little film even though the story itself isn't all that original and I think there are a few too many clich&eacute;d characters and jokes throughout. Still, I like the fact that the studio threw in some added social commentary dealing with people who are "supposed" to hate one another even if there's no real reason. I think some of the strongest stuff here are the vocal performances including the wonderful Pearl Bailey who plays Big Mama. I thought she brought a lot of soul to the performance and easily managed to be the best vocal performance. It seems both Rooney and Russell aren't overly popular among Disney fans but I thought both of them were good here. Neither one deserves a place in the Disney Vocal Hall of Fame but they are still fun and share some nice chemistry together. I thought all of the lead characters were quite charming and fun to watch. The fox certainly is the best written of the group but I also enjoyed the older dog and well as the new one in training. The animation was extremely well done and especially during the finale when we're given an excellent fight between the fox, the hound and a bear. The amount of detail in this sequence is just wonderful. With that said, I thought the rest of the characters were quite forgettable and I thought there really weren't enough laughs to really carry the thing. Still, THE FOX AND THE HOUND has enough to where it should keep fans of the genre entertained.

    An honest look at maturing. Childhood friends have their way of disappearing yet under the gun, literally so , returning. Not the warning of doom and gloom as, say, The Black Hole, or the absolutely surrealistic fantasy of Cinderella. But a fine and balanced medium. Disney's supreme animated effort as far as I am concerned. Loyalties remain. Maturity happens. A hunting we will indeed go. But the prey is captures, and precious memories of childhood return and the bitterest and most old school man of the woods is touched. It was once said all is well that ends well. I believe a wise old Englishman said that during the time of Elizabeth the First. Wisely said. **********

    I was on a car trip to Virginia when I first saw this movie. It looked really sad so I wasn't sure if I really wanted to see. Thank god that I saw this film! It's really good. I just learned that this movie was based off a book and it seemed like the most depressing and disturbing summary I've ever read (along with Hunchback of Notre Dame). Well, let's get back to the Disney version. It has some really enjoyable moments when little Copper and Todd played or the woodpecker scenes. They just make me so happy. Some scenes made me sad when Todd had to be let go or the introduction to the movie (you should just skip the first scene and wait until Big Mama gets introduced). I find this movie really good! How could people hate it? The music isn't great. All I remember is "Goodbye May Seem Forever" and it makes me cry. The characters are sub-par. Is Big Mama a girl or a boy? I can't really tell, he just sounds gay. Copper is adorable when he was young, but why did you turn into a giant d- bag when you were older? Vixie has a stale white bread personality. I would hate Amos when he's a real life person. Chief is pretty cool. Todd is one of my favorite characters. He's adorable, innocent, friendly, and tough! Otherwise, I really like this movie! Get a bag of popcorn, a box of tissues, and waterproof mascara in order to enjoy The Fox and the Hound

    Walt Disney Productions wouldn't release another animated feature until the dreaded "Black Cauldron" in 1985, by which point the last of Walt Disney's Nine Old Men (Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston and Wolfgang Reitherman) had departed from the studio (after having worked there since before 1937's "Snow White"), Michael Eisner had taken over the Magic Kingdom, changed the company's name to Walt Disney PICTURES and pushed NEARLY ALL (if not ALL) film credits to the end of their animated features from the aforementioned "Black Cauldron" onwards (all animated Disney productions from before the dawn of Eisner's reign in 1984 ONLY had opening credits and simply ended with "THE END") and brought Disney dangerously close to Rock Bottom. While the film isn't my favorite Disney flick, it's certainly a very sweet charming finale to the good old days at Disney. Especially the bonds between Tod and the Widow Tweed, and, of course, Tod and Copper, themselves ("The Best of Friends" and "Goodbye May Seem Forever" are two of the most poignant songs in the Disney canon, ESPECIALLY the latter, when the Widow Tweed has to reintroduce Tod to the forest). Even the "villains" (if you can even call them that) are actually likable and sympathetic (extremely unusual by Disney standards). Amos Slade the hunter is not your stereotypical "evil hunter" (that character archetype was not established until Percival McLeech in "The Rescuers 2" in 1990). He only hunts for a living and is, incidentally voiced by (and is even drawn to RESEMBLE) Jack Albertson, best known as Grandpa Joe in the original version of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" (this was also one of Albertson's last roles and the last film he starred in to be released prior to his death just a few months later in 1981). Copper's fellow hunting dog, Chief, seems like a bit of a curmudgeon, but is shown to have a heart of gold, when taking to the young Copper (though he does become somewhat jealous when Amos pays more attention to Copper than to him). Did I mention that Chief's voiced by Pat Buttram, who Disney fans will also know as the Sheriff of Nottingham in "Robin Hood" (1973) and Luke, the whiskey-drinking muskrat in "The Rescuers" (1977), and I'll admit, this definitely seems like one of his more serious, sympathetic voice roles for Disney (The Sheriff of Nottingham may have been laughably evil, but he was still a tax-collecting jerk, and, of course, a comedic idiot). It's hard for me to say whether or not Chief should have been killed after the train accidentally ran him over halfway through the film. On one hand, it would be believable that he'd die, as the train was shown to violently strike him off the bridge and send him sprawling onto the rocky waters below (mostly on screen, and much more detailed than Trusty merely being accidentally knocked over by the dogcatcher's wagon skidding to a sudden halt in "Lady and the Tramp" (1955)), and it would've fully justified Copper and Amos temporarily being upset with Tod for some time after the incident.

The plot, characters, and values portrayed within the film are right on the edge of perfection and quality. Believe me, this film will have you coming back for more,a must-see for the entire family!

    I am in the minority of reviewers that didn't like this movie and I'm still scratching my head as to why. There was nothing heartwarming about this film. In summary, this movie is about Amos, the crazy, trigger happy, red neck maniac, who spends three quarters of the movie trying to hunt and kill a fox named Tod. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what was motivating him to do so. At one point, he even fires at the old woman's car as she's driving it because the fox was in the back seat. The friendship between the two main characters is driven apart when the older hunting dog, Chief, is injured in the process of trying to kill the fox. The hound then swears revenge on the fox...for running for his life? I was really hoping that the bear would have killed Amos and his dog so that the poor fox could get some peace. Instead, the fox saves the two blood thirsty companions and is nearly killed himself by the bear. Even then, Amos still makes another attempt to kill the fox. The movie is supposed to be about a friendship between a fox and a hound that is broken as they grow up and assume their roles as the animals that they are, but I didn't really get a sense of a friendship because they only spent about a minute developing that aspect of the movie. There are also some other characters in the background that don't really move the story much or provide the levity they are supposed to. The music is terrible and Big Momma sounds as though she is improvising the lyrics and melody of the songs. The dialog was really choppy and awkward and did not flow well. I got the sense that this movie was slapped together with bobble gum and scotch tape a few days before it was in theaters. I understand what this movie was attempting to be, but I feel that it failed miserably.

    The Fox and the Hound (1981) *** (out of 4) Another Disney charmer about the unlikely friendship between a fox (voiced by Mickey Rooney) and a hunting dog (voiced by Kurt Russell). The two of them are eventually thought that they're not supposed to get along but this here is challenged when both are in need. THE FOX AND THE HOUND is without a doubt a very charming little film even though the story itself isn't all that original and I think there are a few too many clich&eacute;d characters and jokes throughout. Still, I like the fact that the studio threw in some added social commentary dealing with people who are "supposed" to hate one another even if there's no real reason. I think some of the strongest stuff here are the vocal performances including the wonderful Pearl Bailey who plays Big Mama. I thought she brought a lot of soul to the performance and easily managed to be the best vocal performance. It seems both Rooney and Russell aren't overly popular among Disney fans but I thought both of them were good here. Neither one deserves a place in the Disney Vocal Hall of Fame but they are still fun and share some nice chemistry together. I thought all of the lead characters were quite charming and fun to watch. The fox certainly is the best written of the group but I also enjoyed the older dog and well as the new one in training. The animation was extremely well done and especially during the finale when we're given an excellent fight between the fox, the hound and a bear. The amount of detail in this sequence is just wonderful. With that said, I thought the rest of the characters were quite forgettable and I thought there really weren't enough laughs to really carry the thing. Still, THE FOX AND THE HOUND has enough to where it should keep fans of the genre entertained.

    An honest look at maturing. Childhood friends have their way of disappearing yet under the gun, literally so , returning. Not the warning of doom and gloom as, say, The Black Hole, or the absolutely surrealistic fantasy of Cinderella. But a fine and balanced medium. Disney's supreme animated effort as far as I am concerned. Loyalties remain. Maturity happens. A hunting we will indeed go. But the prey is captures, and precious memories of childhood return and the bitterest and most old school man of the woods is touched. It was once said all is well that ends well. I believe a wise old Englishman said that during the time of Elizabeth the First. Wisely said. **********

    I was on a car trip to Virginia when I first saw this movie. It looked really sad so I wasn't sure if I really wanted to see. Thank god that I saw this film! It's really good. I just learned that this movie was based off a book and it seemed like the most depressing and disturbing summary I've ever read (along with Hunchback of Notre Dame). Well, let's get back to the Disney version. It has some really enjoyable moments when little Copper and Todd played or the woodpecker scenes. They just make me so happy. Some scenes made me sad when Todd had to be let go or the introduction to the movie (you should just skip the first scene and wait until Big Mama gets introduced). I find this movie really good! How could people hate it? The music isn't great. All I remember is "Goodbye May Seem Forever" and it makes me cry. The characters are sub-par. Is Big Mama a girl or a boy? I can't really tell, he just sounds gay. Copper is adorable when he was young, but why did you turn into a giant d- bag when you were older? Vixie has a stale white bread personality. I would hate Amos when he's a real life person. Chief is pretty cool. Todd is one of my favorite characters. He's adorable, innocent, friendly, and tough! Otherwise, I really like this movie! Get a bag of popcorn, a box of tissues, and waterproof mascara in order to enjoy The Fox and the Hound

    Walt Disney Productions wouldn't release another animated feature until the dreaded "Black Cauldron" in 1985, by which point the last of Walt Disney's Nine Old Men (Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston and Wolfgang Reitherman) had departed from the studio (after having worked there since before 1937's "Snow White"), Michael Eisner had taken over the Magic Kingdom, changed the company's name to Walt Disney PICTURES and pushed NEARLY ALL (if not ALL) film credits to the end of their animated features from the aforementioned "Black Cauldron" onwards (all animated Disney productions from before the dawn of Eisner's reign in 1984 ONLY had opening credits and simply ended with "THE END") and brought Disney dangerously close to Rock Bottom. While the film isn't my favorite Disney flick, it's certainly a very sweet charming finale to the good old days at Disney. Especially the bonds between Tod and the Widow Tweed, and, of course, Tod and Copper, themselves ("The Best of Friends" and "Goodbye May Seem Forever" are two of the most poignant songs in the Disney canon, ESPECIALLY the latter, when the Widow Tweed has to reintroduce Tod to the forest). Even the "villains" (if you can even call them that) are actually likable and sympathetic (extremely unusual by Disney standards). Amos Slade the hunter is not your stereotypical "evil hunter" (that character archetype was not established until Percival McLeech in "The Rescuers 2" in 1990). He only hunts for a living and is, incidentally voiced by (and is even drawn to RESEMBLE) Jack Albertson, best known as Grandpa Joe in the original version of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" (this was also one of Albertson's last roles and the last film he starred in to be released prior to his death just a few months later in 1981). Copper's fellow hunting dog, Chief, seems like a bit of a curmudgeon, but is shown to have a heart of gold, when taking to the young Copper (though he does become somewhat jealous when Amos pays more attention to Copper than to him). Did I mention that Chief's voiced by Pat Buttram, who Disney fans will also know as the Sheriff of Nottingham in "Robin Hood" (1973) and Luke, the whiskey-drinking muskrat in "The Rescuers" (1977), and I'll admit, this definitely seems like one of his more serious, sympathetic voice roles for Disney (The Sheriff of Nottingham may have been laughably evil, but he was still a tax-collecting jerk, and, of course, a comedic idiot). It's hard for me to say whether or not Chief should have been killed after the train accidentally ran him over halfway through the film. On one hand, it would be believable that he'd die, as the train was shown to violently strike him off the bridge and send him sprawling onto the rocky waters below (mostly on screen, and much more detailed than Trusty merely being accidentally knocked over by the dogcatcher's wagon skidding to a sudden halt in "Lady and the Tramp" (1955)), and it would've fully justified Copper and Amos temporarily being upset with Tod for some time after the incident. However, Chief seemed somewhat admirable underneath his curmudgeon-like mannerisms (though not quite on par with the aforementioned Trusty in terms of likableness) and so it may be good that he survived (Incidentally, Trusty and Chief would've BOTH ended up dying in their respective films had "executive meddling" as TV Tropes calls it, not decided to spare them, which makes one wonder why they DID kill off some perfectly likable characters in later Disney films such as "The Lion King II: Simba's Pride", "Tarzan" and even "The Princess and the Frog"). Anyways, "The Fox and the Hound" is again, a beautiful goodbye to classic Disney, as (I forgot to mention earlier) even when Disney did recover from the critical disaster of "The Black Cauldron" (with the likes of "The Great Mouse Detective", "Oliver & Company", and, of course, "The Little Mermaid"), Disney animation was never truly the same again. The words "The End" conclude the entire film in a way almost no previous Disney film had done before (except possibly "Bambi" and "The Rescuers"): An audio flashback of young Tod and Copper saying however they'll always be friends forever ("Yeah, forever.") with a soft sweet finale medley blending the aforementioned "Best of Friends" and "Goodbye May Seem Forever" together. Two chimes faintly ding as the following words appear on screen for the final time: The End - Walt Disney Productions. :.)

    Yet it is BY FAR one of the better movies Disney has put out. It's darker than most Disney movies, but has a lot of heart to it. This was probably somewhat of a crossroads for Disney studios. The last of the old animators left with this underrated gem. What I like about it is that the story relies on plot to carry it along and serves as a welcome reminder that audiences don't require some lame pop reference or in-joke every five minutes to sustain their interest. Before Pixar told us all that "you've got a friend in me" in that vexatious voice, Disney had a pair of critters that taught us how to be the best of friends... until you grow up and try to kill each other. Truth be told, it wasn't taboo for animated movies to break your heart before the flicks went ridiculously PC, almost vindictively, to teach a lesson. There were movies with the heaps of torment aimed at a baby, and a child losing its parent. These films weren't sugar-coated, even if they had their moments of ridiculous cuteness that could keep viewers with the feature. The Fox and the Hound is one of those movies that looks all cute and warm, but turns around and GRABS your heart, rips it out of your chest, and stomps rancorously as you're left suffering. It may seem cute to the point of clich&eacute; or pandering, but lessons are taught, and most definitely learned, by the the struggles portrayed on screen. The reality of friendship is a tough thing for kids to understand until they've lost friends and look back on life. The Fox and the Hound is by no means preachy. The message is underneath the surface, no matter what interpretation one has of the meaning behind the film. There is a story for children, to learn about nature, to stare at the adorably cute animals and witness their trials. And there's one for adults, who will remember friendships that got cast aside along the way, about the tragic ironies in life, about people stuck in their ways to their own disadvantage, about bogged down into status quo, be it right or wrong. The story is a trembling, sensitive tale about the realities of life, of friendship, of the way things are, and how we wish it to be. Here, life is not so beautiful, and things do not always have a happy ending--but we are compelled to strive for the best in the end. Characters are unexpectedly sensitive and believable-- Widow Tweed, whose loneliness is tenderly portrayed... Amos Slade, a gruff hunter whose hardened heart is touched by his dogs (his only companions)... ...and of course, the brilliant anthropomorphic cast: Tod, the fox who grows up in innocence believing in a friendship that could last forever-- Copper, the hound dog who realizes that life cannot be as simple as he wishes. What results of such work is a film that is both enjoyable to children and adults.

    I gained some interest in this one. So I picked it up at best buy for 20$. Now, My favorite Disney movie ever is "Bambi". But When I was watching it Half-way through, I thought this was going to beat Bambi. Negatives: Some of the drawings/Animation looks odd. The scenes were it shows the birds chasing the caterpillar throughout the movie, are REALLY pointless and serves no point but to be filler scenes. Positives: The Film is very depressing at times. But in a very powerful way. (especially the ending.) I REALLY like the design of the foxes. Soundtrack is great, The voices are great. Very entertaining. There was a scene where the old lady abandons Todd. This scene made EVERYONE cry. (according to some facebook posts.) when I was watching it, I didn't even drop a tear. But I can see why it's so sad.  Overall: The Fox and the hound made it to NUMBER 2 in my favorite Disney movies. However Bambi is STILL the king.

    WARNING: Show this movie to your children at your own risk! OK, time to get serious. Let me make it quite clear to you web surfers that I am a big fan of Disney films, and cinema in general, but this one I have always disliked. OK, let me make it clear I don't hate it. To be fair, the artwork is decent and the voice acting matches. Even Hollywood legend Mickey Rooney put effort into his role here. But the reason I dislike this movie is because it goes from "cutesy, cuddly and childish" to "dark, terrifying, malicious, sadistic, ferocious...etc." so quickly the kids cannot suspect something is wrong. First you have Tod and Copper playing innocently, promising to be best friends forever then you have them making vicious, growling, faces and trying to bite each other's throats. This whole scene actually scared me as a 4-5 year old to the point where I didn't watch it again for years. I cannot believe scenes like this and the climax still kept the G rating! Does the MPAA just check the poster for the Walt Disney signature and say "Well, it says Disney on it so I guess it means it gets a G rating"? And on top of that, your children will likely learn to fight as brutally as shown in this movie, Disney seems to have no respect for the fact that kids are easily frightened and often repeat what they see. To be honest, I found these scenes very appalling for a G-rated Disney flick, and I was shocked that it's seldom talked about on the internet. I honestly hope I'm not alone in my opinions here. Even my family barely feels sorry for me on this matter, but we are currently considering disposing of the VHS. So if you're a parent looking for good, family fun this isn't it. Try some of Disney's other movies, like Sword in the Stone, Winnie the Pooh or The Lion King. At least the latter was more wholesome, used frightening images sparingly, showed little violence and taught a useful message.

    Many critics have said that The Fox and the Hound is a bit too cute. I have to disagree. While it is mainly a sugarcoated film it has it's dark and intense moments as well. The story revolves around an orphaned baby fox named Tod and his friendship that he forms with a hound dog named Copper who is owned by a hunter who lives nearby. Their friendship seems unbreakable and forever lasting but Tod is warned that Copper will become a trained killer after he goes on a hunting trip. Time passes and Tod wonders if they are still best friends. What happens later on will put their friendship to the ultimate test. The Fox and the Hound has it's ups and downs. The last fifteen minutes of the film shows what finally happens between Tod and Copper. A surprise turn of events unfold. What happens? Watch and find out. This film shows us that even the most unlikeliest of people can become great friends. It also seems to touch on the racism issue. Not long ago black and white people could not be good friends or it brought criticism. This seems to make sense with Tod being a Fox and Copper being a hound. They are supposed to be born enemies but the innocence of youth blinds them to this. Will the friendship last?

    Yet it is BY FAR one of the better movies Disney has put out. It's darker than most Disney movies, but has a lot of heart to it. This was probably somewhat of a crossroads for Disney studios. The last of the old animators left with this underrated gem. What I like about it is that the story relies on plot to carry it along and serves as a welcome reminder that audiences don't require some lame pop reference or in-joke every five minutes to sustain their interest. Before Pixar told us all that "you've got a friend in me" in that vexatious voice, Disney had a pair of critters that taught us how to be the best of friends... until you grow up and try to kill each other. Truth be told, it wasn't taboo for animated movies to break your heart before the flicks went ridiculously PC, almost vindictively, to teach a lesson. There were movies with the heaps of torment aimed at a baby, and a child losing its parent. These films weren't sugar-coated, even if they had their moments of ridiculous cuteness that could keep viewers with the feature. The Fox and the Hound is one of those movies that looks all cute and warm, but turns around and GRABS your heart, rips it out of your chest, and stomps rancorously as you're left suffering. It may seem cute to the point of clich&eacute; or pandering, but lessons are taught, and most definitely learned, by the the struggles portrayed on screen. The reality of friendship is a tough thing for kids to understand until they've lost friends and look back on life. The Fox and the Hound is by no means preachy. The message is underneath the surface, no matter what interpretation one has of the meaning behind the film. There is a story for children, to learn about nature, to stare at the adorably cute animals and witness their trials. And there's one for adults, who will remember friendships that got cast aside along the way, about the tragic ironies in life, about people stuck in their ways to their own disadvantage, about bogged down into status quo, be it right or wrong. The story is a trembling, sensitive tale about the realities of life, of friendship, of the way things are, and how we wish it to be. Here, life is not so beautiful, and things do not always have a happy ending--but we are compelled to strive for the best in the end. Characters are unexpectedly sensitive and believable-- Widow Tweed, whose loneliness is tenderly portrayed... Amos Slade, a gruff hunter whose hardened heart is touched by his dogs (his only companions)... ...and of course, the brilliant anthropomorphic cast: Tod, the fox who grows up in innocence believing in a friendship that could last forever-- Copper, the hound dog who realizes that life cannot be as simple as he wishes. What results of such work is a film that is both enjoyable to children and adults.

    I gained some interest in this one. So I picked it up at best buy for 20$. Now, My favorite Disney movie ever is "Bambi". But When I was watching it Half-way through, I thought this was going to beat Bambi. Negatives: Some of the drawings/Animation looks odd. The scenes were it shows the birds chasing the caterpillar throughout the movie, are REALLY pointless and serves no point but to be filler scenes. Positives: The Film is very depressing at times. But in a very powerful way. (especially the ending.) I REALLY like the design of the foxes. Soundtrack is great, The voices are great. Very entertaining. There was a scene where the old lady abandons Todd. This scene made EVERYONE cry. (according to some facebook posts.) when I was watching it, I didn't even drop a tear. But I can see why it's so sad.  Overall: The Fox and the hound made it to NUMBER 2 in my favorite Disney movies. However Bambi is STILL the king.

    WARNING: Show this movie to your children at your own risk! OK, time to get serious. Let me make it quite clear to you web surfers that I am a big fan of Disney films, and cinema in general, but this one I have always disliked. OK, let me make it clear I don't hate it. To be fair, the artwork is decent and the voice acting matches. Even Hollywood legend Mickey Rooney put effort into his role here. But the reason I dislike this movie is because it goes from "cutesy, cuddly and childish" to "dark, terrifying, malicious, sadistic, ferocious...etc." so quickly the kids cannot suspect something is wrong. First you have Tod and Copper playing innocently, promising to be best friends forever then you have them making vicious, growling, faces and trying to bite each other's throats. This whole scene actually scared me as a 4-5 year old to the point where I didn't watch it again for years. I cannot believe scenes like this and the climax still kept the G rating! Does the MPAA just check the poster for the Walt Disney signature and say "Well, it says Disney on it so I guess it means it gets a G rating"? And on top of that, your children will likely learn to fight as brutally as shown in this movie, Disney seems to have no respect for the fact that kids are easily frightened and often repeat what they see. To be honest, I found these scenes very appalling for a G-rated Disney flick, and I was shocked that it's seldom talked about on the internet. I honestly hope I'm not alone in my opinions here. Even my family barely feels sorry for me on this matter, but we are currently considering disposing of the VHS. So if you're a parent looking for good, family fun this isn't it. Try some of Disney's other movies, like Sword in the Stone, Winnie the Pooh or The Lion King. At least the latter was more wholesome, used frightening images sparingly, showed little violence and taught a useful message.

    Many critics have said that The Fox and the Hound is a bit too cute. I have to disagree. While it is mainly a sugarcoated film it has it's dark and intense moments as well. The story revolves around an orphaned baby fox named Tod and his friendship that he forms with a hound dog named Copper who is owned by a hunter who lives nearby. Their friendship seems unbreakable and forever lasting but Tod is warned that Copper will become a trained killer after he goes on a hunting trip. Time passes and Tod wonders if they are still best friends. What happens later on will put their friendship to the ultimate test. The Fox and the Hound has it's ups and downs. The last fifteen minutes of the film shows what finally happens between Tod and Copper. A surprise turn of events unfold. What happens? Watch and find out. This film shows us that even the most unlikeliest of people can become great friends. It also seems to touch on the racism issue. Not long ago black and white people could not be good friends or it brought criticism. This seems to make sense with Tod being a Fox and Copper being a hound. They are supposed to be born enemies but the innocence of youth blinds them to this. Will the friendship last?

    This movie had me in tears near the end. However, I wasn't crying tears of sadness...I was crying tears of joy. This movie is a true Disney masterpiece that I grew up watching as a child and I will hold it dear to my heart until the day I die. Through the events and characters within the movie, this film nails the feelings of love, friendship, and sacrifice, and hardships that no other animated movie has ever nailed so perfectly. I commend Don Bluth with his hand in the animation department, as well as the composer on the breathtaking score. The plot, characters, and values portrayed within the film are right on the edge of perfection and quality. Believe me, this film will have you coming back for more,a must-see for the entire family!

    I am in the minority of reviewers that didn't like this movie and I'm still scratching my head as to why. There was nothing heartwarming about this film. In summary, this movie is about Amos, the crazy, trigger happy, red neck maniac, who spends three quarters of the movie trying to hunt and kill a fox named Tod. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what was motivating him to do so. At one point, he even fires at the old woman's car as she's driving it because the fox was in the back seat. The friendship between the two main characters is driven apart when the older hunting dog, Chief, is injured in the process of trying to kill the fox. The hound then swears revenge on the fox...for running for his life? I was really hoping that the bear would have killed Amos and his dog so that the poor fox could get some peace. Instead, the fox saves the two blood thirsty companions and is nearly killed himself by the bear. Even then, Amos still makes another attempt to kill the fox. The movie is supposed to be about a friendship between a fox and a hound that is broken as they grow up and assume their roles as the animals that they are, but I didn't really get a sense of a friendship because they only spent about a minute developing that aspect of the movie. There are also some other characters in the background that don't really move the story much or provide the levity they are supposed to. The music is terrible and Big Momma sounds as though she is improvising the lyrics and melody of the songs. The dialog was really choppy and awkward and did not flow well. I got the sense that this movie was slapped together with bobble gum and scotch tape a few days before it was in theaters. I understand what this movie was attempting to be, but I feel that it failed miserably.

    The Fox and the Hound (1981) *** (out of 4) Another Disney charmer about the unlikely friendship between a fox (voiced by Mickey Rooney) and a hunting dog (voiced by Kurt Russell). The two of them are eventually thought that they're not supposed to get along but this here is challenged when both are in need. THE FOX AND THE HOUND is without a doubt a very charming little film even though the story itself isn't all that original and I think there are a few too many clich&eacute;d characters and jokes throughout. Still, I like the fact that the studio threw in some added social commentary dealing with people who are "supposed" to hate one another even if there's no real reason. I think some of the strongest stuff here are the vocal performances including the wonderful Pearl Bailey who plays Big Mama. I thought she brought a lot of soul to the performance and easily managed to be the best vocal performance. It seems both Rooney and Russell aren't overly popular among Disney fans but I thought both of them were good here. Neither one deserves a place in the Disney Vocal Hall of Fame but they are still fun and share some nice chemistry together. I thought all of the lead characters were quite charming and fun to watch. The fox certainly is the best written of the group but I also enjoyed the older dog and well as the new one in training. The animation was extremely well done and especially during the finale when we're given an excellent fight between the fox, the hound and a bear. The amount of detail in this sequence is just wonderful. With that said, I thought the rest of the characters were quite forgettable and I thought there really weren't enough laughs to really carry the thing. Still, THE FOX AND THE HOUND has enough to where it should keep fans of the genre entertained.

    An honest look at maturing. Childhood friends have their way of disappearing yet under the gun, literally so , returning. Not the warning of doom and gloom as, say, The Black Hole, or the absolutely surrealistic fantasy of Cinderella. But a fine and balanced medium. Disney's supreme animated effort as far as I am concerned. Loyalties remain. Maturity happens. A hunting we will indeed go. But the prey is captures, and precious memories of childhood return and the bitterest and most old school man of the woods is touched. It was once said all is well that ends well. I believe a wise old Englishman said that during the time of Elizabeth the First. Wisely said. **********

    I was on a car trip to Virginia when I first saw this movie. It looked really sad so I wasn't sure if I really wanted to see. Thank god that I saw this film! It's really good. I just learned that this movie was based off a book and it seemed like the most depressing and disturbing summary I've ever read (along with Hunchback of Notre Dame). Well, let's get back to the Disney version. It has some really enjoyable moments when little Copper and Todd played or the woodpecker scenes. They just make me so happy. Some scenes made me sad when Todd had to be let go or the introduction to the movie (you should just skip the first scene and wait until Big Mama gets introduced). I find this movie really good! How could people hate it? The music isn't great. All I remember is "Goodbye May Seem Forever" and it makes me cry. The characters are sub-par. Is Big Mama a girl or a boy? I can't really tell, he just sounds gay. Copper is adorable when he was young, but why did you turn into a giant d- bag when you were older? Vixie has a stale white bread personality. I would hate Amos when he's a real life person. Chief is pretty cool. Todd is one of my favorite characters. He's adorable, innocent, friendly, and tough! Otherwise, I really like this movie! Get a bag of popcorn, a box of tissues, and waterproof mascara in order to enjoy The Fox and the Hound

    Walt Disney Productions wouldn't release another animated feature until the dreaded "Black Cauldron" in 1985, by which point the last of Walt Disney's Nine Old Men (Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston and Wolfgang Reitherman) had departed from the studio (after having worked there since before 1937's "Snow White"), Michael Eisner had taken over the Magic Kingdom, changed the company's name to Walt Disney PICTURES and pushed NEARLY ALL (if not ALL) film credits to the end of their animated features from the aforementioned "Black Cauldron" onwards (all animated Disney productions from before the dawn of Eisner's reign in 1984 ONLY had opening credits and simply ended with "THE END") and brought Disney dangerously close to Rock Bottom. While the film isn't my favorite Disney flick, it's certainly a very sweet charming finale to the good old days at Disney. Especially the bonds between Tod and the Widow Tweed, and, of course, Tod and Copper, themselves ("The Best of Friends" and "Goodbye May Seem Forever" are two of the most poignant songs in the Disney canon, ESPECIALLY the latter, when the Widow Tweed has to reintroduce Tod to the forest). Even the "villains" (if you can even call them that) are actually likable and sympathetic (extremely unusual by Disney standards). Amos Slade the hunter is not your stereotypical "evil hunter" (that character archetype was not established until Percival McLeech in "The Rescuers 2" in 1990). He only hunts for a living and is, incidentally voiced by (and is even drawn to RESEMBLE) Jack Albertson, best known as Grandpa Joe in the original version of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" (this was also one of Albertson's last roles and the last film he starred in to be released prior to his death just a few months later in 1981). Copper's fellow hunting dog, Chief, seems like a bit of a curmudgeon, but is shown to have a heart of gold, when taking to the young Copper (though he does become somewhat jealous when Amos pays more attention to Copper than to him). Did I mention that Chief's voiced by Pat Buttram, who Disney fans will also know as the Sheriff of Nottingham in "Robin Hood" (1973) and Luke, the whiskey-drinking muskrat in "The Rescuers" (1977), and I'll admit, this definitely seems like one of his more serious, sympathetic voice roles for Disney (The Sheriff of Nottingham may have been laughably evil, but he was still a tax-collecting jerk, and, of course, a comedic idiot). It's hard for me to say whether or not Chief should have been killed after the train accidentally ran him over halfway through the film. On one hand, it would be believable that he'd die, as the train was shown to violently strike him off the bridge and send him sprawling onto the rocky waters below (mostly on screen, and much more detailed than Trusty merely being accidentally knocked over by the dogcatcher's wagon skidding to a sudden halt in "Lady and the Tramp" (1955)), and it would've fully justified Copper and Amos temporarily being upset with Tod for some time after the incident. However, Chief seemed somewhat admirable underneath his curmudgeon-like mannerisms (though not quite on par with the aforementioned Trusty in terms of likableness) and so it may be good that he survived (Incidentally, Trusty and Chief would've BOTH ended up dying in their respective films had "executive meddling" as TV Tropes calls it, not decided to spare them, which makes one wonder why they DID kill off some perfectly likable characters in later Disney films such as "The Lion King II: Simba's Pride", "Tarzan" and even "The Princess and the Frog"). Anyways, "The Fox and the Hound" is again, a beautiful goodbye to classic Disney, as (I forgot to mention earlier) even when Disney did recover from the critical disaster of "The Black Cauldron" (with the likes of "The Great Mouse Detective", "Oliver & Company", and, of course, "The Little Mermaid"), Disney animation was never truly the same again. The words "The End" conclude the entire film in a way almost no previous Disney film had done before (except possibly "Bambi" and "The Rescuers"): An audio flashback of young Tod and Copper saying however they'll always be friends forever ("Yeah, forever.") with a soft sweet finale medley blending the aforementioned "Best of Friends" and "Goodbye May Seem Forever" together. Two chimes faintly ding as the following words appear on screen for the final time: The End - Walt Disney Productions. :.)

THE FOX AND THE HOUND is without a doubt a very charming little film even though the story itself isn't all that original and I think there are a few too many clich&eacute;d characters and jokes throughout. Still, I like the fact that the studio threw in some added social commentary dealing with people who are "supposed" to hate one another even if there's no real reason. I think some of the strongest stuff here are the vocal performances including the wonderful Pearl Bailey who plays Big Mama. I thought she brought a lot of soul to the performance and easily managed to be the best vocal performance. It seems both Rooney and Russell aren't overly popular among Disney fans but I thought both of them were good here. Neither one deserves a place in the Disney Vocal Hall of Fame but they are still fun and share some nice chemistry together. I thought all of the lead characters were quite charming and fun to watch. The fox certainly is the best written of the group but I also enjoyed the older dog and well as the new one in training. The animation was extremely well done and especially during the finale when we're given an excellent fight between the fox, the hound and a bear. The amount of detail in this sequence is just wonderful. With that said, I thought the rest of the characters were quite forgettable and I thought there really weren't enough laughs to really carry the thing. Still, THE FOX AND THE HOUND has enough to where it should keep fans of the genre entertained.

    An honest look at maturing. Childhood friends have their way of disappearing yet under the gun, literally so , returning. Not the warning of doom and gloom as, say, The Black Hole, or the absolutely surrealistic fantasy of Cinderella. But a fine and balanced medium. Disney's supreme animated effort as far as I am concerned. Loyalties remain. Maturity happens. A hunting we will indeed go. But the prey is captures, and precious memories of childhood return and the bitterest and most old school man of the woods is touched. It was once said all is well that ends well. I believe a wise old Englishman said that during the time of Elizabeth the First. Wisely said. **********

    I was on a car trip to Virginia when I first saw this movie. It looked really sad so I wasn't sure if I really wanted to see. Thank god that I saw this film! It's really good. I just learned that this movie was based off a book and it seemed like the most depressing and disturbing summary I've ever read (along with Hunchback of Notre Dame). Well, let's get back to the Disney version. It has some really enjoyable moments when little Copper and Todd played or the woodpecker scenes. They just make me so happy. Some scenes made me sad when Todd had to be let go or the introduction to the movie (you should just skip the first scene and wait until Big Mama gets introduced). I find this movie really good! How could people hate it? The music isn't great. All I remember is "Goodbye May Seem Forever" and it makes me cry. The characters are sub-par. Is Big Mama a girl or a boy? I can't really tell, he just sounds gay. Copper is adorable when he was young, but why did you turn into a giant d- bag when you were older? Vixie has a stale white bread personality. I would hate Amos when he's a real life person. Chief is pretty cool. Todd is one of my favorite characters. He's adorable, innocent, friendly, and tough! Otherwise, I really like this movie! Get a bag of popcorn, a box of tissues, and waterproof mascara in order to enjoy The Fox and the Hound

    Walt Disney Productions wouldn't release another animated feature until the dreaded "Black Cauldron" in 1985, by which point the last of Walt Disney's Nine Old Men (Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston and Wolfgang Reitherman) had departed from the studio (after having worked there since before 1937's "Snow White"), Michael Eisner had taken over the Magic Kingdom, changed the company's name to Walt Disney PICTURES and pushed NEARLY ALL (if not ALL) film credits to the end of their animated features from the aforementioned "Black Cauldron" onwards (all animated Disney productions from before the dawn of Eisner's reign in 1984 ONLY had opening credits and simply ended with "THE END") and brought Disney dangerously close to Rock Bottom. While the film isn't my favorite Disney flick, it's certainly a very sweet charming finale to the good old days at Disney. Especially the bonds between Tod and the Widow Tweed, and, of course, Tod and Copper, themselves ("The Best of Friends" and "Goodbye May Seem Forever" are two of the most poignant songs in the Disney canon, ESPECIALLY the latter, when the Widow Tweed has to reintroduce Tod to the forest). Even the "villains" (if you can even call them that) are actually likable and sympathetic (extremely unusual by Disney standards). Amos Slade the hunter is not your stereotypical "evil hunter" (that character archetype was not established until Percival McLeech in "The Rescuers 2" in 1990). He only hunts for a living and is, incidentally voiced by (and is even drawn to RESEMBLE) Jack Albertson, best known as Grandpa Joe in the original version of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" (this was also one of Albertson's last roles and the last film he starred in to be released prior to his death just a few months later in 1981). Copper's fellow hunting dog, Chief, seems like a bit of a curmudgeon, but is shown to have a heart of gold, when taking to the young Copper (though he does become somewhat jealous when Amos pays more attention to Copper than to him). Did I mention that Chief's voiced by Pat Buttram, who Disney fans will also know as the Sheriff of Nottingham in "Robin Hood" (1973) and Luke, the whiskey-drinking muskrat in "The Rescuers" (1977), and I'll admit, this definitely seems like one of his more serious, sympathetic voice roles for Disney (The Sheriff of Nottingham may have been laughably evil, but he was still a tax-collecting jerk, and, of course, a comedic idiot). It's hard for me to say whether or not Chief should have been killed after the train accidentally ran him over halfway through the film. On one hand, it would be believable that he'd die, as the train was shown to violently strike him off the bridge and send him sprawling onto the rocky waters below (mostly on screen, and much more detailed than Trusty merely being accidentally knocked over by the dogcatcher's wagon skidding to a sudden halt in "Lady and the Tramp" (1955)), and it would've fully justified Copper and Amos temporarily being upset with Tod for some time after the incident. However, Chief seemed somewhat admirable underneath his curmudgeon-like mannerisms (though not quite on par with the aforementioned Trusty in terms of likableness) and so it may be good that he survived (Incidentally, Trusty and Chief would've BOTH ended up dying in their respective films had "executive meddling" as TV Tropes calls it, not decided to spare them, which makes one wonder why they DID kill off some perfectly likable characters in later Disney films such as "The Lion King II: Simba's Pride", "Tarzan" and even "The Princess and the Frog"). Anyways, "The Fox and the Hound" is again, a beautiful goodbye to classic Disney, as (I forgot to mention earlier) even when Disney did recover from the critical disaster of "The Black Cauldron" (with the likes of "The Great Mouse Detective", "Oliver & Company", and, of course, "The Little Mermaid"), Disney animation was never truly the same again. The words "The End" conclude the entire film in a way almost no previous Disney film had done before (except possibly "Bambi" and "The Rescuers"): An audio flashback of young Tod and Copper saying however they'll always be friends forever ("Yeah, forever.") with a soft sweet finale medley blending the aforementioned "Best of Friends" and "Goodbye May Seem Forever" together. Two chimes faintly ding as the following words appear on screen for the final time: The End - Walt Disney Productions. :.)

    Yet it is BY FAR one of the better movies Disney has put out. It's darker than most Disney movies, but has a lot of heart to it. This was probably somewhat of a crossroads for Disney studios. The last of the old animators left with this underrated gem. What I like about it is that the story relies on plot to carry it along and serves as a welcome reminder that audiences don't require some lame pop reference or in-joke every five minutes to sustain their interest. Before Pixar told us all that "you've got a friend in me" in that vexatious voice, Disney had a pair of critters that taught us how to be the best of friends... until you grow up and try to kill each other. Truth be told, it wasn't taboo for animated movies to break your heart before the flicks went ridiculously PC, almost vindictively, to teach a lesson. There were movies with the heaps of torment aimed at a baby, and a child losing its parent. These films weren't sugar-coated, even if they had their moments of ridiculous cuteness that could keep viewers with the feature. The Fox and the Hound is one of those movies that looks all cute and warm, but turns around and GRABS your heart, rips it out of your chest, and stomps rancorously as you're left suffering. It may seem cute to the point of clich&eacute; or pandering, but lessons are taught, and most definitely learned, by the the struggles portrayed on screen. The reality of friendship is a tough thing for kids to understand until they've lost friends and look back on life. The Fox and the Hound is by no means preachy. The message is underneath the surface, no matter what interpretation one has of the meaning behind the film. There is a story for children, to learn about nature, to stare at the adorably cute animals and witness their trials. And there's one for adults, who will remember friendships that got cast aside along the way, about the tragic ironies in life, about people stuck in their ways to their own disadvantage, about bogged down into status quo, be it right or wrong. The story is a trembling, sensitive tale about the realities of life, of friendship, of the way things are, and how we wish it to be. Here, life is not so beautiful, and things do not always have a happy ending--but we are compelled to strive for the best in the end. Characters are unexpectedly sensitive and believable-- Widow Tweed, whose loneliness is tenderly portrayed... Amos Slade, a gruff hunter whose hardened heart is touched by his dogs (his only companions)... ...and of course, the brilliant anthropomorphic cast: Tod, the fox who grows up in innocence believing in a friendship that could last forever-- Copper, the hound dog who realizes that life cannot be as simple as he wishes. What results of such work is a film that is both enjoyable to children and adults.

    I gained some interest in this one. So I picked it up at best buy for 20$. Now, My favorite Disney movie ever is "Bambi". But When I was watching it Half-way through, I thought this was going to beat Bambi. Negatives: Some of the drawings/Animation looks odd. The scenes were it shows the birds chasing the caterpillar throughout the movie, are REALLY pointless and serves no point but to be filler scenes. Positives: The Film is very depressing at times. But in a very powerful way. (especially the ending.) I REALLY like the design of the foxes. Soundtrack is great, The voices are great. Very entertaining. There was a scene where the old lady abandons Todd. This scene made EVERYONE cry. (according to some facebook posts.) when I was watching it, I didn't even drop a tear. But I can see why it's so sad.  Overall: The Fox and the hound made it to NUMBER 2 in my favorite Disney movies. However Bambi is STILL the king.

    WARNING: Show this movie to your children at your own risk! OK, time to get serious. Let me make it quite clear to you web surfers that I am a big fan of Disney films, and cinema in general, but this one I have always disliked. OK, let me make it clear I don't hate it. To be fair, the artwork is decent and the voice acting matches. Even Hollywood legend Mickey Rooney put effort into his role here. But the reason I dislike this movie is because it goes from "cutesy, cuddly and childish" to "dark, terrifying, malicious, sadistic, ferocious...etc." so quickly the kids cannot suspect something is wrong. First you have Tod and Copper playing innocently, promising to be best friends forever then you have them making vicious, growling, faces and trying to bite each other's throats. This whole scene actually scared me as a 4-5 year old to the point where I didn't watch it again for years. I cannot believe scenes like this and the climax still kept the G rating! Does the MPAA just check the poster for the Walt Disney signature and say "Well, it says Disney on it so I guess it means it gets a G rating"? And on top of that, your children will likely learn to fight as brutally as shown in this movie, Disney seems to have no respect for the fact that kids are easily frightened and often repeat what they see. To be honest, I found these scenes very appalling for a G-rated Disney flick, and I was shocked that it's seldom talked about on the internet. I honestly hope I'm not alone in my opinions here. Even my family barely feels sorry for me on this matter, but we are currently considering disposing of the VHS. So if you're a parent looking for good, family fun this isn't it. Try some of Disney's other movies, like Sword in the Stone, Winnie the Pooh or The Lion King. At least the latter was more wholesome, used frightening images sparingly, showed little violence and taught a useful message.

    Many critics have said that The Fox and the Hound is a bit too cute. I have to disagree. While it is mainly a sugarcoated film it has it's dark and intense moments as well. The story revolves around an orphaned baby fox named Tod and his friendship that he forms with a hound dog named Copper who is owned by a hunter who lives nearby. Their friendship seems unbreakable and forever lasting but Tod is warned that Copper will become a trained killer after he goes on a hunting trip. Time passes and Tod wonders if they are still best friends. What happens later on will put their friendship to the ultimate test. The Fox and the Hound has it's ups and downs. The last fifteen minutes of the film shows what finally happens between Tod and Copper. A surprise turn of events unfold. What happens? Watch and find out. This film shows us that even the most unlikeliest of people can become great friends. It also seems to touch on the racism issue. Not long ago black and white people could not be good friends or it brought criticism. This seems to make sense with Tod being a Fox and Copper being a hound. They are supposed to be born enemies but the innocence of youth blinds them to this. Will the friendship last?

    This movie had me in tears near the end. However, I wasn't crying tears of sadness...I was crying tears of joy. This movie is a true Disney masterpiece that I grew up watching as a child and I will hold it dear to my heart until the day I die. Through the events and characters within the movie, this film nails the feelings of love, friendship, and sacrifice, and hardships that no other animated movie has ever nailed so perfectly. I commend Don Bluth with his hand in the animation department, as well as the composer on the breathtaking score. The plot, characters, and values portrayed within the film are right on the edge of perfection and quality. Believe me, this film will have you coming back for more,a must-see for the entire family!

    I am in the minority of reviewers that didn't like this movie and I'm still scratching my head as to why. There was nothing heartwarming about this film. In summary, this movie is about Amos, the crazy, trigger happy, red neck maniac, who spends three quarters of the movie trying to hunt and kill a fox named Tod. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what was motivating him to do so. At one point, he even fires at the old woman's car as she's driving it because the fox was in the back seat. The friendship between the two main characters is driven apart when the older hunting dog, Chief, is injured in the process of trying to kill the fox. The hound then swears revenge on the fox...for running for his life? I was really hoping that the bear would have killed Amos and his dog so that the poor fox could get some peace. Instead, the fox saves the two blood thirsty companions and is nearly killed himself by the bear. Even then, Amos still makes another attempt to kill the fox. The movie is supposed to be about a friendship between a fox and a hound that is broken as they grow up and assume their roles as the animals that they are, but I didn't really get a sense of a friendship because they only spent about a minute developing that aspect of the movie. There are also some other characters in the background that don't really move the story much or provide the levity they are supposed to. The music is terrible and Big Momma sounds as though she is improvising the lyrics and melody of the songs. The dialog was really choppy and awkward and did not flow well. I got the sense that this movie was slapped together with bobble gum and scotch tape a few days before it was in theaters. I understand what this movie was attempting to be, but I feel that it failed miserably.

    Walt Disney Productions wouldn't release another animated feature until the dreaded "Black Cauldron" in 1985, by which point the last of Walt Disney's Nine Old Men (Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston and Wolfgang Reitherman) had departed from the studio (after having worked there since before 1937's "Snow White"), Michael Eisner had taken over the Magic Kingdom, changed the company's name to Walt Disney PICTURES and pushed NEARLY ALL (if not ALL) film credits to the end of their animated features from the aforementioned "Black Cauldron" onwards (all animated Disney productions from before the dawn of Eisner's reign in 1984 ONLY had opening credits and simply ended with "THE END") and brought Disney dangerously close to Rock Bottom.

    I gained some interest in this one. So I picked it up at best buy for 20$. Now, My favorite Disney movie ever is "Bambi". But When I was watching it Half-way through, I thought this was going to beat Bambi. Negatives: Some of the drawings/Animation looks odd. The scenes were it shows the birds chasing the caterpillar throughout the movie, are REALLY pointless and serves no point but to be filler scenes. Positives: The Film is very depressing at times. But in a very powerful way. (especially the ending.) I REALLY like the design of the foxes. Soundtrack is great, The voices are great. Very entertaining. There was a scene where the old lady abandons Todd. This scene made EVERYONE cry. (according to some facebook posts.) when I was watching it, I didn't even drop a tear. But I can see why it's so sad.  Overall: The Fox and the hound made it to NUMBER 2 in my favorite Disney movies. However Bambi is STILL the king.

    WARNING: Show this movie to your children at your own risk! OK, time to get serious. Let me make it quite clear to you web surfers that I am a big fan of Disney films, and cinema in general, but this one I have always disliked. OK, let me make it clear I don't hate it. To be fair, the artwork is decent and the voice acting matches. Even Hollywood legend Mickey Rooney put effort into his role here. But the reason I dislike this movie is because it goes from "cutesy, cuddly and childish" to "dark, terrifying, malicious, sadistic, ferocious...etc." so quickly the kids cannot suspect something is wrong. First you have Tod and Copper playing innocently, promising to be best friends forever then you have them making vicious, growling, faces and trying to bite each other's throats. This whole scene actually scared me as a 4-5 year old to the point where I didn't watch it again for years. I cannot believe scenes like this and the climax still kept the G rating! Does the MPAA just check the poster for the Walt Disney signature and say "Well, it says Disney on it so I guess it means it gets a G rating"? And on top of that, your children will likely learn to fight as brutally as shown in this movie, Disney seems to have no respect for the fact that kids are easily frightened and often repeat what they see. To be honest, I found these scenes very appalling for a G-rated Disney flick, and I was shocked that it's seldom talked about on the internet. I honestly hope I'm not alone in my opinions here. Even my family barely feels sorry for me on this matter, but we are currently considering disposing of the VHS. So if you're a parent looking for good, family fun this isn't it. Try some of Disney's other movies, like Sword in the Stone, Winnie the Pooh or The Lion King. At least the latter was more wholesome, used frightening images sparingly, showed little violence and taught a useful message.

    Many critics have said that The Fox and the Hound is a bit too cute. I have to disagree. While it is mainly a sugarcoated film it has it's dark and intense moments as well. The story revolves around an orphaned baby fox named Tod and his friendship that he forms with a hound dog named Copper who is owned by a hunter who lives nearby. Their friendship seems unbreakable and forever lasting but Tod is warned that Copper will become a trained killer after he goes on a hunting trip. Time passes and Tod wonders if they are still best friends. What happens later on will put their friendship to the ultimate test. The Fox and the Hound has it's ups and downs. The last fifteen minutes of the film shows what finally happens between Tod and Copper. A surprise turn of events unfold. What happens? Watch and find out. This film shows us that even the most unlikeliest of people can become great friends. It also seems to touch on the racism issue. Not long ago black and white people could not be good friends or it brought criticism. This seems to make sense with Tod being a Fox and Copper being a hound. They are supposed to be born enemies but the innocence of youth blinds them to this. Will the friendship last?
