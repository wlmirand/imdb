    Mr Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is a frustrated musician and composer. He is frustrated at his teaching job. It was supposed to be temporary to pay the bills. But the years pass, his life passes, and he feels he has achieved nothing. But what he discovers is that his life has meaning for all those he has touched over years. This is definitely one of those feel good movies. The individual stories are memorable. The feeling of lost palpable. The moment when he finally connects with his deaf child. That was powerful. All the stories are poignant. Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly suited as the old disillusioned teacher. It's a good cry movie all the way.

    Oh for goodness sake. Would all musicians complaining about the music kindly stuff off. I play a bit of rugby but still thoroughly enjoyed "Invictus" despite some ropey rugby sequences. This film is not about the music. This is the wonderful story of an ordinary man who strived to be something extraordinary and always felt as though he had let himself and his family down by not becoming the man he felt he should have been, when in fact he became so much more extraordinary than he could ever have imagined. Mr Holland's opus WASN'T the music, his opus was his pupils and the impression he made on their lives, and the final scene, with his realisation that his life hadn't been wasted is one of the most moving things I have ever seen on screen. So there. I am a big girls blouse.

    Mr. Holland's Opus is a lovely and engaging film about a musician and composer forced by life to get a 'real job'. The movie skillfully takes place over many decades and is tied together by the music of each generation. Filled with all the emotions and decisions we each must deal with every day, Mr. Holland's Opus explores what it means to have your dreams conflict with your reality with results ranging from frustration to melancholy to joy. Heartfelt without pandering or being overly sappy I think this will appeal to watchers of all ages, especially those who had someone in their life who left an everlasting trace.

    This is a lovely film about a teacher's career and dreams that never get fulfilled. In the beginning he has to take a teaching job in a high school, with hopes to earn enough to later concentrate on his true love in life, composing. This dream never comes true as the four years that he's planning to teach become thirty years. The magnificent classical piece heard during the opening credits, the grand opus he's dreaming one day to compose, never becomes reality; instead, at the end of the film we hear a considerably different, "inferior" piece as a deliberate contrast, but in the end it doesn't matter to him - he has found his true fulfillment in life in inspiring his students to love music, within the confines of the high school world. One point off for the length, but otherwise highly recommended and heartwarming, tastefully directed movie.

    I enjoyed this film in its initial theatrical run, then repeated viewings. Just recently (I don't have it on DVD yet) it came on TV so I recorded it as my teenage boys haven't seen it. So my wife, the boys and I watched it together and enjoyed it. Great performances all around, especially for Richard Dreyfuss. He was fantastic as the composer-turned-high school music teacher. A wonderful blend of drama and comedy! Having the historic aspect of world events was a terrific idea. I would say another reason we enjoyed the film was how it presented teaching.....that it can be done in other ways to get across to students. The soundtrack for the film was also chosen well!

    *** out of **** A heartfelt performance by Richard Dreyfuss is the strongest asset of this good, though not great, movie. Dreyfuss was nominated for Best Actor in playing Glenn Holland, a young man who dreams of one day completing a memorable piece of great classical music. In order to make ends meet and feed his wife and deaf son, he must lower his standards by taking on a frustrating teacher's job at a high school. Holland initially has a tough time trying to interest his lethargic students in music appreciation, but his efforts ultimately pay off as he begins to make a difference in their lives. Spanning a period of 30 years from about 1965 to 1995, the film does not successfully realize that transition as well as it might have. For example, I was able to spot a number of chronological errors in how the montage of passing years was represented. But one personal highlight in the film for me involved Holland's devastation upon learning of the murder of John Lennon in 1980.

    Richard Dreyfuss is a terrific actor. His Oscar-Winning role in 'The Goodbye Girl', has remained as a topic. And I believe, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' is a another film, that uses the potential of this veteran actor, and utilizes him to the optimum. As a film, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' is an interesting film, a neat film, that makes a memorable protagonist. Presented as a video biography, of the 30-year career of the eponymous lead character, Glenn Howard, who is a music teacher. Glenn Howard's journey is well-written and offers heartfelt moments, with a stellar performance by Dreyfuss. Stephen Herek directs this story with maturity. Cinematography, Editing & Background Score, are worth a mention. Dreyfuss earned a Oscar and Golden-Globe Nomination for his Performance here, for Best Actor, and deserved to. This is one of his best performances to date. He makes Glenn Howard memorable. On the whole, A Must for Dreyfuss fanatics.

    The same problem that plagued "Akeelah and the Bee" is present in "Mr. Holland's Opus." The various episodes that occurred through Holland's life are each played with the emotional intensity as appropriate for a climax. Thus, put together, the film is skewed by such a sequence of highly charged emotional "peaks." The result is that the drama's form is thrown off, and instead of a general rise to a climactic plateau, the entire conceit is full of too many peaks. By the time the last scene comes, there's no where to go but to pile on the emotion, straining what intensity there is left to the breaking point. If the scenario had been put together with less routinely occurring crises, it would have helped shape the drama more palatably. As it is, by the end I just wanted to say, "Oh please, no more." Richard Dryfuss puts his all into this effort, and his work is most commendable. It's the writer and director that let him down by not better shaping the film's broad structure. A pity, for this could have been a really significant piece of work set in the public schools.

    A well-intentioned redemption movie that follows all its formulas sweetly, then tries one last tear-jerk that just makes us feel dirty, paying off with a nice piece of elevator muzak that is so memorable, it will have you humming something else within five minutes of hearing it. Richard Dreyfus is Mr. Holland, a composer who begrudgingly takes a job as a high school music teacher to make ends meet. His methods are rigid at first, as he forgets that music is meant to be fun. Then he remembers. Then his students forget. And so on. There's the faithful, supportive wife (Glenne Headly), the brash football coach buddy (Bill Meister), the anal principal who butts heads with Holland over his "revolutionary" teaching methods, like teaching rock and roll and other devil's music (William H. Macy), the wet-mouthed schoolgirl with the crush (Jean Louisa Kelly, who sexes Holland with a sensual rendition of "Someone to Watch Over Me"), the black underprivileged kid with no rhythm-- hang on now!-- The wha-? Terrence Howard pretends really badly that whitey Dreyfus teaches him soul... and finally, for this man whose life revolves around hearing - his wife births a deaf son. Writer Patrick Sheane Duncan shows us the Poignant Plot Device Handbook is a harsh mistress. Throughout his career of coaxing musicality from his students and sending out into the world, Holland slaves over a masterpiece that we only hear in snatches as he toodles on his piano and scribbles notes. Then the big payoff. Holland, old, exhausted, forced into retirement, is given a final surprise by his students, as they assemble in the auditorium as an orchestra to perform his magnum opus for the first time. And after 30 years of working on this piece of music which he brazenly calls "American Symphony"; after all that sweat and sacrifice and slaving, his magnum opus sounds like - elevator muzak! In 12/8 time, a tuneless, embarrassing, meandering piece of unmemorable laundry detergent commercial. And look at the faces on the crowd: inspired, majestic, flavor bursting in your mouth not in your hand. MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS is a cry for art, a plea for creativity, a pledge against mediocrity - and The "American Symphony" is the turd in the swimming pool of musical appreciation. It is blathered quite overtly that Mr. Holland's true opus is the collective education of his students over the years. THEY are his masterpiece... Thank Christ! For a moment, we thought we'd have to continue to hold our "inspired" faces for your laundry detergent commercial...

    This moving drama about a mans thirty year teaching career came out in a decade dominated by big budget action films.It may not have been big news at the box office compared with some films,yet never the less found a place in peoples hearts.Mr Hollands Opus is also one of the best films about a teacher who has a bigger impact on their students than they think. In some ways it could be an updated version of Goodbye Mr Chips.We follow a man who doesn't really want to teach at first and is considered a bit distant,yet as the years progress he becomes dearly loved and he adores his job. Moving seamlessly from the mid 60's through to 1995 it covers events like Vietnam,Robert Kennedy's assassination and John Lennon's murder.It manages to pull off a neat trick in never feeling rushed,even though it doesn't dwell in one decade longer than the others. Directed by Stephen Herek,with a moving script by Patrick Sheane Duncan.Mr Holland's Opus stars Richard Dreyfuss as aspiring musician Glenn Holland who becomes the temporary music teacher at the John F. Kennedy High School.At first he sees the job as nothing but a pay check but over time he grows to love it more than anything else.Beginning in the mid 1960's the film moves across the period of thirty years in the job. He also earns the wrath of the cautious deputy head teacher Mr.Wolters(William H.Macy)when he spices things up in the music room by playing the students rock and roll as opposed to just classical(so he can get them interested in the subject). We also share the joy and sadness which make up his private life,his loving and endlessly patient wife Iris(Glenne Headly)and his deaf son Cole(Anthony Natale).His inability for a while to accept Coles condition lead shim to devote more time to his students and soon he must choose between his family or his teaching but it is not an easy choice for him. Dreyfuss is tailor made for the role,giving a subtle and moving performance his Mr Holland is a quiet but strong and determined man who's love for music transfers easily to his students over the years. There's fine support from Jay Thomas as football coach Bill Meister who becomes a close friend of Glenn and Olympia Dukakis as Principle Jacobs,Alicia Witt as one of Hollands greatest achievements as a teacher the shy Gertrude Lang who's struggle to play perfect music is one of many moving subplots.And Jean Louise Kelly shines as singing student Rowena Morgan,who has a crush on Mr Holland and has a love of music matched only by his. Uplifting and deeply moving,this is a must see for anyone who's had a teacher that meant so much to them and even influenced their career. For those who were around during the 60's and 70's it's a trip down music memory lane.With tunes like Louie Louie and Imagine making the soundtrack it's an upbeat and joyful experience for anyone who loves music in any form.

    Mr Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is a frustrated musician and composer. He is frustrated at his teaching job. It was supposed to be temporary to pay the bills. But the years pass, his life passes, and he feels he has achieved nothing. But what he discovers is that his life has meaning for all those he has touched over years. This is definitely one of those feel good movies. The individual stories are memorable. The feeling of lost palpable. The moment when he finally connects with his deaf child. That was powerful. All the stories are poignant. Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly suited as the old disillusioned teacher. It's a good cry movie all the way.

    Oh for goodness sake. Would all musicians complaining about the music kindly stuff off. I play a bit of rugby but still thoroughly enjoyed "Invictus" despite some ropey rugby sequences. This film is not about the music. This is the wonderful story of an ordinary man who strived to be something extraordinary and always felt as though he had let himself and his family down by not becoming the man he felt he should have been, when in fact he became so much more extraordinary than he could ever have imagined. Mr Holland's opus WASN'T the music, his opus was his pupils and the impression he made on their lives, and the final scene, with his realisation that his life hadn't been wasted is one of the most moving things I have ever seen on screen. So there. I am a big girls blouse.

    Mr. Holland's Opus is a lovely and engaging film about a musician and composer forced by life to get a 'real job'. The movie skillfully takes place over many decades and is tied together by the music of each generation. Filled with all the emotions and decisions we each must deal with every day, Mr. Holland's Opus explores what it means to have your dreams conflict with your reality with results ranging from frustration to melancholy to joy. Heartfelt without pandering or being overly sappy I think this will appeal to watchers of all ages, especially those who had someone in their life who left an everlasting trace.

    This is a lovely film about a teacher's career and dreams that never get fulfilled. In the beginning he has to take a teaching job in a high school, with hopes to earn enough to later concentrate on his true love in life, composing. This dream never comes true as the four years that he's planning to teach become thirty years. The magnificent classical piece heard during the opening credits, the grand opus he's dreaming one day to compose, never becomes reality; instead, at the end of the film we hear a considerably different, "inferior" piece as a deliberate contrast, but in the end it doesn't matter to him - he has found his true fulfillment in life in inspiring his students to love music, within the confines of the high school world. One point off for the length, but otherwise highly recommended and heartwarming, tastefully directed movie.

    I enjoyed this film in its initial theatrical run, then repeated viewings. Just recently (I don't have it on DVD yet) it came on TV so I recorded it as my teenage boys haven't seen it. So my wife, the boys and I watched it together and enjoyed it. Great performances all around, especially for Richard Dreyfuss. He was fantastic as the composer-turned-high school music teacher. A wonderful blend of drama and comedy! Having the historic aspect of world events was a terrific idea. I would say another reason we enjoyed the film was how it presented teaching.....that it can be done in other ways to get across to students. The soundtrack for the film was also chosen well!

    *** out of **** A heartfelt performance by Richard Dreyfuss is the strongest asset of this good, though not great, movie. Dreyfuss was nominated for Best Actor in playing Glenn Holland, a young man who dreams of one day completing a memorable piece of great classical music. In order to make ends meet and feed his wife and deaf son, he must lower his standards by taking on a frustrating teacher's job at a high school. Holland initially has a tough time trying to interest his lethargic students in music appreciation, but his efforts ultimately pay off as he begins to make a difference in their lives. Spanning a period of 30 years from about 1965 to 1995, the film does not successfully realize that transition as well as it might have. For example, I was able to spot a number of chronological errors in how the montage of passing years was represented. But one personal highlight in the film for me involved Holland's devastation upon learning of the murder of John Lennon in 1980.

    Richard Dreyfuss is a terrific actor. His Oscar-Winning role in 'The Goodbye Girl', has remained as a topic. And I believe, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' is a another film, that uses the potential of this veteran actor, and utilizes him to the optimum. As a film, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' is an interesting film, a neat film, that makes a memorable protagonist. Presented as a video biography, of the 30-year career of the eponymous lead character, Glenn Howard, who is a music teacher. Glenn Howard's journey is well-written and offers heartfelt moments, with a stellar performance by Dreyfuss. Stephen Herek directs this story with maturity. Cinematography, Editing & Background Score, are worth a mention. Dreyfuss earned a Oscar and Golden-Globe Nomination for his Performance here, for Best Actor, and deserved to. This is one of his best performances to date. He makes Glenn Howard memorable. On the whole, A Must for Dreyfuss fanatics.

    The same problem that plagued "Akeelah and the Bee" is present in "Mr. Holland's Opus." The various episodes that occurred through Holland's life are each played with the emotional intensity as appropriate for a climax. Thus, put together, the film is skewed by such a sequence of highly charged emotional "peaks." The result is that the drama's form is thrown off, and instead of a general rise to a climactic plateau, the entire conceit is full of too many peaks. By the time the last scene comes, there's no where to go but to pile on the emotion, straining what intensity there is left to the breaking point. If the scenario had been put together with less routinely occurring crises, it would have helped shape the drama more palatably. As it is, by the end I just wanted to say, "Oh please, no more." Richard Dryfuss puts his all into this effort, and his work is most commendable. It's the writer and director that let him down by not better shaping the film's broad structure. A pity, for this could have been a really significant piece of work set in the public schools.

    A well-intentioned redemption movie that follows all its formulas sweetly, then tries one last tear-jerk that just makes us feel dirty, paying off with a nice piece of elevator muzak that is so memorable, it will have you humming something else within five minutes of hearing it. Richard Dreyfus is Mr. Holland, a composer who begrudgingly takes a job as a high school music teacher to make ends meet. His methods are rigid at first, as he forgets that music is meant to be fun. Then he remembers. Then his students forget. And so on. There's the faithful, supportive wife (Glenne Headly), the brash football coach buddy (Bill Meister), the anal principal who butts heads with Holland over his "revolutionary" teaching methods, like teaching rock and roll and other devil's music (William H. Macy), the wet-mouthed schoolgirl with the crush (Jean Louisa Kelly, who sexes Holland with a sensual rendition of "Someone to Watch Over Me"), the black underprivileged kid with no rhythm-- hang on now!-- The wha-? Terrence Howard pretends really badly that whitey Dreyfus teaches him soul... and finally, for this man whose life revolves around hearing - his wife births a deaf son. Writer Patrick Sheane Duncan shows us the Poignant Plot Device Handbook is a harsh mistress. Throughout his career of coaxing musicality from his students and sending out into the world, Holland slaves over a masterpiece that we only hear in snatches as he toodles on his piano and scribbles notes. Then the big payoff. Holland, old, exhausted, forced into retirement, is given a final surprise by his students, as they assemble in the auditorium as an orchestra to perform his magnum opus for the first time. And after 30 years of working on this piece of music which he brazenly calls "American Symphony"; after all that sweat and sacrifice and slaving, his magnum opus sounds like - elevator muzak! In 12/8 time, a tuneless, embarrassing, meandering piece of unmemorable laundry detergent commercial. And look at the faces on the crowd: inspired, majestic, flavor bursting in your mouth not in your hand. MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS is a cry for art, a plea for creativity, a pledge against mediocrity - and The "American Symphony" is the turd in the swimming pool of musical appreciation. It is blathered quite overtly that Mr. Holland's true opus is the collective education of his students over the years. THEY are his masterpiece... Thank Christ! For a moment, we thought we'd have to continue to hold our "inspired" faces for your laundry detergent commercial...

    This moving drama about a mans thirty year teaching career came out in a decade dominated by big budget action films.It may not have been big news at the box office compared with some films,yet never the less found a place in peoples hearts.Mr Hollands Opus is also one of the best films about a teacher who has a bigger impact on their students than they think. In some ways it could be an updated version of Goodbye Mr Chips.We follow a man who doesn't really want to teach at first and is considered a bit distant,yet as the years progress he becomes dearly loved and he adores his job. Moving seamlessly from the mid 60's through to 1995 it covers events like Vietnam,Robert Kennedy's assassination and John Lennon's murder.It manages to pull off a neat trick in never feeling rushed,even though it doesn't dwell in one decade longer than the others. Directed by Stephen Herek,with a moving script by Patrick Sheane Duncan.Mr Holland's Opus stars Richard Dreyfuss as aspiring musician Glenn Holland who becomes the temporary music teacher at the John F. Kennedy High School.At first he sees the job as nothing but a pay check but over time he grows to love it more than anything else.Beginning in the mid 1960's the film moves across the period of thirty years in the job. He also earns the wrath of the cautious deputy head teacher Mr.Wolters(William H.Macy)when he spices things up in the music room by playing the students rock and roll as opposed to just classical(so he can get them interested in the subject). We also share the joy and sadness which make up his private life,his loving and endlessly patient wife Iris(Glenne Headly)and his deaf son Cole(Anthony Natale).His inability for a while to accept Coles condition lead shim to devote more time to his students and soon he must choose between his family or his teaching but it is not an easy choice for him. Dreyfuss is tailor made for the role,giving a subtle and moving performance his Mr Holland is a quiet but strong and determined man who's love for music transfers easily to his students over the years. There's fine support from Jay Thomas as football coach Bill Meister who becomes a close friend of Glenn and Olympia Dukakis as Principle Jacobs,Alicia Witt as one of Hollands greatest achievements as a teacher the shy Gertrude Lang who's struggle to play perfect music is one of many moving subplots.And Jean Louise Kelly shines as singing student Rowena Morgan,who has a crush on Mr Holland and has a love of music matched only by his. Uplifting and deeply moving,this is a must see for anyone who's had a teacher that meant so much to them and even influenced their career. For those who were around during the 60's and 70's it's a trip down music memory lane.With tunes like Louie Louie and Imagine making the soundtrack it's an upbeat and joyful experience for anyone who loves music in any form.

    Mr. Holland's Opus is a lovely and engaging film about a musician and composer forced by life to get a 'real job'. The movie skillfully takes place over many decades and is tied together by the music of each generation. Filled with all the emotions and decisions we each must deal with every day, Mr. Holland's Opus explores what it means to have your dreams conflict with your reality with results ranging from frustration to melancholy to joy. Heartfelt without pandering or being overly sappy I think this will appeal to watchers of all ages, especially those who had someone in their life who left an everlasting trace.

    This is a lovely film about a teacher's career and dreams that never get fulfilled. In the beginning he has to take a teaching job in a high school, with hopes to earn enough to later concentrate on his true love in life, composing. This dream never comes true as the four years that he's planning to teach become thirty years. The magnificent classical piece heard during the opening credits, the grand opus he's dreaming one day to compose, never becomes reality; instead, at the end of the film we hear a considerably different, "inferior" piece as a deliberate contrast, but in the end it doesn't matter to him - he has found his true fulfillment in life in inspiring his students to love music, within the confines of the high school world. One point off for the length, but otherwise highly recommended and heartwarming, tastefully directed movie.

    I enjoyed this film in its initial theatrical run, then repeated viewings. Just recently (I don't have it on DVD yet) it came on TV so I recorded it as my teenage boys haven't seen it. So my wife, the boys and I watched it together and enjoyed it. Great performances all around, especially for Richard Dreyfuss. He was fantastic as the composer-turned-high school music teacher. A wonderful blend of drama and comedy! Having the historic aspect of world events was a terrific idea. I would say another reason we enjoyed the film was how it presented teaching.....that it can be done in other ways to get across to students. The soundtrack for the film was also chosen well!

    *** out of **** A heartfelt performance by Richard Dreyfuss is the strongest asset of this good, though not great, movie. Dreyfuss was nominated for Best Actor in playing Glenn Holland, a young man who dreams of one day completing a memorable piece of great classical music. In order to make ends meet and feed his wife and deaf son, he must lower his standards by taking on a frustrating teacher's job at a high school. Holland initially has a tough time trying to interest his lethargic students in music appreciation, but his efforts ultimately pay off as he begins to make a difference in their lives. Spanning a period of 30 years from about 1965 to 1995, the film does not successfully realize that transition as well as it might have. For example, I was able to spot a number of chronological errors in how the montage of passing years was represented. But one personal highlight in the film for me involved Holland's devastation upon learning of the murder of John Lennon in 1980.

    Richard Dreyfuss is a terrific actor. His Oscar-Winning role in 'The Goodbye Girl', has remained as a topic. And I believe, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' is a another film, that uses the potential of this veteran actor, and utilizes him to the optimum. As a film, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' is an interesting film, a neat film, that makes a memorable protagonist. Presented as a video biography, of the 30-year career of the eponymous lead character, Glenn Howard, who is a music teacher. Glenn Howard's journey is well-written and offers heartfelt moments, with a stellar performance by Dreyfuss. Stephen Herek directs this story with maturity. Cinematography, Editing & Background Score, are worth a mention. Dreyfuss earned a Oscar and Golden-Globe Nomination for his Performance here, for Best Actor, and deserved to. This is one of his best performances to date. He makes Glenn Howard memorable. On the whole, A Must for Dreyfuss fanatics.

    The same problem that plagued "Akeelah and the Bee" is present in "Mr. Holland's Opus." The various episodes that occurred through Holland's life are each played with the emotional intensity as appropriate for a climax. Thus, put together, the film is skewed by such a sequence of highly charged emotional "peaks." The result is that the drama's form is thrown off, and instead of a general rise to a climactic plateau, the entire conceit is full of too many peaks. By the time the last scene comes, there's no where to go but to pile on the emotion, straining what intensity there is left to the breaking point. If the scenario had been put together with less routinely occurring crises, it would have helped shape the drama more palatably. As it is, by the end I just wanted to say, "Oh please, no more." Richard Dryfuss puts his all into this effort, and his work is most commendable. It's the writer and director that let him down by not better shaping the film's broad structure. A pity, for this could have been a really significant piece of work set in the public schools.

    A well-intentioned redemption movie that follows all its formulas sweetly, then tries one last tear-jerk that just makes us feel dirty, paying off with a nice piece of elevator muzak that is so memorable, it will have you humming something else within five minutes of hearing it. Richard Dreyfus is Mr. Holland, a composer who begrudgingly takes a job as a high school music teacher to make ends meet. His methods are rigid at first, as he forgets that music is meant to be fun. Then he remembers. Then his students forget. And so on. There's the faithful, supportive wife (Glenne Headly), the brash football coach buddy (Bill Meister), the anal principal who butts heads with Holland over his "revolutionary" teaching methods, like teaching rock and roll and other devil's music (William H. Macy), the wet-mouthed schoolgirl with the crush (Jean Louisa Kelly, who sexes Holland with a sensual rendition of "Someone to Watch Over Me"), the black underprivileged kid with no rhythm-- hang on now!-- The wha-? Terrence Howard pretends really badly that whitey Dreyfus teaches him soul... and finally, for this man whose life revolves around hearing - his wife births a deaf son. Writer Patrick Sheane Duncan shows us the Poignant Plot Device Handbook is a harsh mistress. Throughout his career of coaxing musicality from his students and sending out into the world, Holland slaves over a masterpiece that we only hear in snatches as he toodles on his piano and scribbles notes. Then the big payoff. Holland, old, exhausted, forced into retirement, is given a final surprise by his students, as they assemble in the auditorium as an orchestra to perform his magnum opus for the first time. And after 30 years of working on this piece of music which he brazenly calls "American Symphony"; after all that sweat and sacrifice and slaving, his magnum opus sounds like - elevator muzak! In 12/8 time, a tuneless, embarrassing, meandering piece of unmemorable laundry detergent commercial. And look at the faces on the crowd: inspired, majestic, flavor bursting in your mouth not in your hand. MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS is a cry for art, a plea for creativity, a pledge against mediocrity - and The "American Symphony" is the turd in the swimming pool of musical appreciation. It is blathered quite overtly that Mr. Holland's true opus is the collective education of his students over the years. THEY are his masterpiece... Thank Christ! For a moment, we thought we'd have to continue to hold our "inspired" faces for your laundry detergent commercial...

    This moving drama about a mans thirty year teaching career came out in a decade dominated by big budget action films.It may not have been big news at the box office compared with some films,yet never the less found a place in peoples hearts.Mr Hollands Opus is also one of the best films about a teacher who has a bigger impact on their students than they think. In some ways it could be an updated version of Goodbye Mr Chips.We follow a man who doesn't really want to teach at first and is considered a bit distant,yet as the years progress he becomes dearly loved and he adores his job. Moving seamlessly from the mid 60's through to 1995 it covers events like Vietnam,Robert Kennedy's assassination and John Lennon's murder.It manages to pull off a neat trick in never feeling rushed,even though it doesn't dwell in one decade longer than the others. Directed by Stephen Herek,with a moving script by Patrick Sheane Duncan.Mr Holland's Opus stars Richard Dreyfuss as aspiring musician Glenn Holland who becomes the temporary music teacher at the John F. Kennedy High School.At first he sees the job as nothing but a pay check but over time he grows to love it more than anything else.Beginning in the mid 1960's the film moves across the period of thirty years in the job. He also earns the wrath of the cautious deputy head teacher Mr.Wolters(William H.Macy)when he spices things up in the music room by playing the students rock and roll as opposed to just classical(so he can get them interested in the subject). We also share the joy and sadness which make up his private life,his loving and endlessly patient wife Iris(Glenne Headly)and his deaf son Cole(Anthony Natale).His inability for a while to accept Coles condition lead shim to devote more time to his students and soon he must choose between his family or his teaching but it is not an easy choice for him. Dreyfuss is tailor made for the role,giving a subtle and moving performance his Mr Holland is a quiet but strong and determined man who's love for music transfers easily to his students over the years. There's fine support from Jay Thomas as football coach Bill Meister who becomes a close friend of Glenn and Olympia Dukakis as Principle Jacobs,Alicia Witt as one of Hollands greatest achievements as a teacher the shy Gertrude Lang who's struggle to play perfect music is one of many moving subplots.And Jean Louise Kelly shines as singing student Rowena Morgan,who has a crush on Mr Holland and has a love of music matched only by his. Uplifting and deeply moving,this is a must see for anyone who's had a teacher that meant so much to them and even influenced their career. For those who were around during the 60's and 70's it's a trip down music memory lane.With tunes like Louie Louie and Imagine making the soundtrack it's an upbeat and joyful experience for anyone who loves music in any form.

    Mr Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is a frustrated musician and composer. He is frustrated at his teaching job. It was supposed to be temporary to pay the bills. But the years pass, his life passes, and he feels he has achieved nothing. But what he discovers is that his life has meaning for all those he has touched over years. This is definitely one of those feel good movies. The individual stories are memorable. The feeling of lost palpable. The moment when he finally connects with his deaf child. That was powerful. All the stories are poignant. Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly suited as the old disillusioned teacher. It's a good cry movie all the way.

    Oh for goodness sake. Would all musicians complaining about the music kindly stuff off. I play a bit of rugby but still thoroughly enjoyed "Invictus" despite some ropey rugby sequences. This film is not about the music. This is the wonderful story of an ordinary man who strived to be something extraordinary and always felt as though he had let himself and his family down by not becoming the man he felt he should have been, when in fact he became so much more extraordinary than he could ever have imagined. Mr Holland's opus WASN'T the music, his opus was his pupils and the impression he made on their lives, and the final scene, with his realisation that his life hadn't been wasted is one of the most moving things I have ever seen on screen. So there. I am a big girls blouse.

A wonderful blend of drama and comedy! Having the historic aspect of world events was a terrific idea. I would say another reason we enjoyed the film was how it presented teaching.....that it can be done in other ways to get across to students. The soundtrack for the film was also chosen well!

    *** out of **** A heartfelt performance by Richard Dreyfuss is the strongest asset of this good, though not great, movie. Dreyfuss was nominated for Best Actor in playing Glenn Holland, a young man who dreams of one day completing a memorable piece of great classical music. In order to make ends meet and feed his wife and deaf son, he must lower his standards by taking on a frustrating teacher's job at a high school. Holland initially has a tough time trying to interest his lethargic students in music appreciation, but his efforts ultimately pay off as he begins to make a difference in their lives. Spanning a period of 30 years from about 1965 to 1995, the film does not successfully realize that transition as well as it might have. For example, I was able to spot a number of chronological errors in how the montage of passing years was represented. But one personal highlight in the film for me involved Holland's devastation upon learning of the murder of John Lennon in 1980.

    Richard Dreyfuss is a terrific actor. His Oscar-Winning role in 'The Goodbye Girl', has remained as a topic. And I believe, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' is a another film, that uses the potential of this veteran actor, and utilizes him to the optimum. As a film, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' is an interesting film, a neat film, that makes a memorable protagonist. Presented as a video biography, of the 30-year career of the eponymous lead character, Glenn Howard, who is a music teacher. Glenn Howard's journey is well-written and offers heartfelt moments, with a stellar performance by Dreyfuss. Stephen Herek directs this story with maturity. Cinematography, Editing & Background Score, are worth a mention. Dreyfuss earned a Oscar and Golden-Globe Nomination for his Performance here, for Best Actor, and deserved to. This is one of his best performances to date. He makes Glenn Howard memorable. On the whole, A Must for Dreyfuss fanatics.

    The same problem that plagued "Akeelah and the Bee" is present in "Mr. Holland's Opus." The various episodes that occurred through Holland's life are each played with the emotional intensity as appropriate for a climax. Thus, put together, the film is skewed by such a sequence of highly charged emotional "peaks." The result is that the drama's form is thrown off, and instead of a general rise to a climactic plateau, the entire conceit is full of too many peaks. By the time the last scene comes, there's no where to go but to pile on the emotion, straining what intensity there is left to the breaking point. If the scenario had been put together with less routinely occurring crises, it would have helped shape the drama more palatably. As it is, by the end I just wanted to say, "Oh please, no more." Richard Dryfuss puts his all into this effort, and his work is most commendable. It's the writer and director that let him down by not better shaping the film's broad structure. A pity, for this could have been a really significant piece of work set in the public schools.

    A well-intentioned redemption movie that follows all its formulas sweetly, then tries one last tear-jerk that just makes us feel dirty, paying off with a nice piece of elevator muzak that is so memorable, it will have you humming something else within five minutes of hearing it. Richard Dreyfus is Mr. Holland, a composer who begrudgingly takes a job as a high school music teacher to make ends meet. His methods are rigid at first, as he forgets that music is meant to be fun. Then he remembers. Then his students forget. And so on. There's the faithful, supportive wife (Glenne Headly), the brash football coach buddy (Bill Meister), the anal principal who butts heads with Holland over his "revolutionary" teaching methods, like teaching rock and roll and other devil's music (William H. Macy), the wet-mouthed schoolgirl with the crush (Jean Louisa Kelly, who sexes Holland with a sensual rendition of "Someone to Watch Over Me"), the black underprivileged kid with no rhythm-- hang on now!-- The wha-? Terrence Howard pretends really badly that whitey Dreyfus teaches him soul... and finally, for this man whose life revolves around hearing - his wife births a deaf son. Writer Patrick Sheane Duncan shows us the Poignant Plot Device Handbook is a harsh mistress. Throughout his career of coaxing musicality from his students and sending out into the world, Holland slaves over a masterpiece that we only hear in snatches as he toodles on his piano and scribbles notes. Then the big payoff. Holland, old, exhausted, forced into retirement, is given a final surprise by his students, as they assemble in the auditorium as an orchestra to perform his magnum opus for the first time. And after 30 years of working on this piece of music which he brazenly calls "American Symphony"; after all that sweat and sacrifice and slaving, his magnum opus sounds like - elevator muzak! In 12/8 time, a tuneless, embarrassing, meandering piece of unmemorable laundry detergent commercial. And look at the faces on the crowd: inspired, majestic, flavor bursting in your mouth not in your hand. MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS is a cry for art, a plea for creativity, a pledge against mediocrity - and The "American Symphony" is the turd in the swimming pool of musical appreciation. It is blathered quite overtly that Mr. Holland's true opus is the collective education of his students over the years. THEY are his masterpiece... Thank Christ! For a moment, we thought we'd have to continue to hold our "inspired" faces for your laundry detergent commercial...

    This moving drama about a mans thirty year teaching career came out in a decade dominated by big budget action films.It may not have been big news at the box office compared with some films,yet never the less found a place in peoples hearts.Mr Hollands Opus is also one of the best films about a teacher who has a bigger impact on their students than they think. In some ways it could be an updated version of Goodbye Mr Chips.We follow a man who doesn't really want to teach at first and is considered a bit distant,yet as the years progress he becomes dearly loved and he adores his job. Moving seamlessly from the mid 60's through to 1995 it covers events like Vietnam,Robert Kennedy's assassination and John Lennon's murder.It manages to pull off a neat trick in never feeling rushed,even though it doesn't dwell in one decade longer than the others. Directed by Stephen Herek,with a moving script by Patrick Sheane Duncan.Mr Holland's Opus stars Richard Dreyfuss as aspiring musician Glenn Holland who becomes the temporary music teacher at the John F. Kennedy High School.At first he sees the job as nothing but a pay check but over time he grows to love it more than anything else.Beginning in the mid 1960's the film moves across the period of thirty years in the job. He also earns the wrath of the cautious deputy head teacher Mr.Wolters(William H.Macy)when he spices things up in the music room by playing the students rock and roll as opposed to just classical(so he can get them interested in the subject). We also share the joy and sadness which make up his private life,his loving and endlessly patient wife Iris(Glenne Headly)and his deaf son Cole(Anthony Natale).His inability for a while to accept Coles condition lead shim to devote more time to his students and soon he must choose between his family or his teaching but it is not an easy choice for him. Dreyfuss is tailor made for the role,giving a subtle and moving performance his Mr Holland is a quiet but strong and determined man who's love for music transfers easily to his students over the years. There's fine support from Jay Thomas as football coach Bill Meister who becomes a close friend of Glenn and Olympia Dukakis as Principle Jacobs,Alicia Witt as one of Hollands greatest achievements as a teacher the shy Gertrude Lang who's struggle to play perfect music is one of many moving subplots.And Jean Louise Kelly shines as singing student Rowena Morgan,who has a crush on Mr Holland and has a love of music matched only by his. Uplifting and deeply moving,this is a must see for anyone who's had a teacher that meant so much to them and even influenced their career. For those who were around during the 60's and 70's it's a trip down music memory lane.With tunes like Louie Louie and Imagine making the soundtrack it's an upbeat and joyful experience for anyone who loves music in any form.

    Mr Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is a frustrated musician and composer. He is frustrated at his teaching job. It was supposed to be temporary to pay the bills. But the years pass, his life passes, and he feels he has achieved nothing. But what he discovers is that his life has meaning for all those he has touched over years. This is definitely one of those feel good movies. The individual stories are memorable. The feeling of lost palpable. The moment when he finally connects with his deaf child. That was powerful. All the stories are poignant. Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly suited as the old disillusioned teacher. It's a good cry movie all the way.

    Oh for goodness sake. Would all musicians complaining about the music kindly stuff off. I play a bit of rugby but still thoroughly enjoyed "Invictus" despite some ropey rugby sequences. This film is not about the music. This is the wonderful story of an ordinary man who strived to be something extraordinary and always felt as though he had let himself and his family down by not becoming the man he felt he should have been, when in fact he became so much more extraordinary than he could ever have imagined. Mr Holland's opus WASN'T the music, his opus was his pupils and the impression he made on their lives, and the final scene, with his realisation that his life hadn't been wasted is one of the most moving things I have ever seen on screen. So there. I am a big girls blouse.

    Mr. Holland's Opus is a lovely and engaging film about a musician and composer forced by life to get a 'real job'. The movie skillfully takes place over many decades and is tied together by the music of each generation. Filled with all the emotions and decisions we each must deal with every day, Mr. Holland's Opus explores what it means to have your dreams conflict with your reality with results ranging from frustration to melancholy to joy. Heartfelt without pandering or being overly sappy I think this will appeal to watchers of all ages, especially those who had someone in their life who left an everlasting trace.

    This is a lovely film about a teacher's career and dreams that never get fulfilled. In the beginning he has to take a teaching job in a high school, with hopes to earn enough to later concentrate on his true love in life, composing. This dream never comes true as the four years that he's planning to teach become thirty years. The magnificent classical piece heard during the opening credits, the grand opus he's dreaming one day to compose, never becomes reality; instead, at the end of the film we hear a considerably different, "inferior" piece as a deliberate contrast, but in the end it doesn't matter to him - he has found his true fulfillment in life in inspiring his students to love music, within the confines of the high school world. One point off for the length, but otherwise highly recommended and heartwarming, tastefully directed movie.

And I believe, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' is a another film, that uses the potential of this veteran actor, and utilizes him to the optimum. As a film, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' is an interesting film, a neat film, that makes a memorable protagonist. Presented as a video biography, of the 30-year career of the eponymous lead character, Glenn Howard, who is a music teacher. Glenn Howard's journey is well-written and offers heartfelt moments, with a stellar performance by Dreyfuss. Stephen Herek directs this story with maturity. Cinematography, Editing & Background Score, are worth a mention. Dreyfuss earned a Oscar and Golden-Globe Nomination for his Performance here, for Best Actor, and deserved to. This is one of his best performances to date. He makes Glenn Howard memorable. On the whole, A Must for Dreyfuss fanatics.

    The same problem that plagued "Akeelah and the Bee" is present in "Mr. Holland's Opus." The various episodes that occurred through Holland's life are each played with the emotional intensity as appropriate for a climax. Thus, put together, the film is skewed by such a sequence of highly charged emotional "peaks." The result is that the drama's form is thrown off, and instead of a general rise to a climactic plateau, the entire conceit is full of too many peaks. By the time the last scene comes, there's no where to go but to pile on the emotion, straining what intensity there is left to the breaking point. If the scenario had been put together with less routinely occurring crises, it would have helped shape the drama more palatably. As it is, by the end I just wanted to say, "Oh please, no more." Richard Dryfuss puts his all into this effort, and his work is most commendable. It's the writer and director that let him down by not better shaping the film's broad structure. A pity, for this could have been a really significant piece of work set in the public schools.

    A well-intentioned redemption movie that follows all its formulas sweetly, then tries one last tear-jerk that just makes us feel dirty, paying off with a nice piece of elevator muzak that is so memorable, it will have you humming something else within five minutes of hearing it. Richard Dreyfus is Mr. Holland, a composer who begrudgingly takes a job as a high school music teacher to make ends meet. His methods are rigid at first, as he forgets that music is meant to be fun. Then he remembers. Then his students forget. And so on. There's the faithful, supportive wife (Glenne Headly), the brash football coach buddy (Bill Meister), the anal principal who butts heads with Holland over his "revolutionary" teaching methods, like teaching rock and roll and other devil's music (William H. Macy), the wet-mouthed schoolgirl with the crush (Jean Louisa Kelly, who sexes Holland with a sensual rendition of "Someone to Watch Over Me"), the black underprivileged kid with no rhythm-- hang on now!-- The wha-? Terrence Howard pretends really badly that whitey Dreyfus teaches him soul... and finally, for this man whose life revolves around hearing - his wife births a deaf son. Writer Patrick Sheane Duncan shows us the Poignant Plot Device Handbook is a harsh mistress. Throughout his career of coaxing musicality from his students and sending out into the world, Holland slaves over a masterpiece that we only hear in snatches as he toodles on his piano and scribbles notes. Then the big payoff. Holland, old, exhausted, forced into retirement, is given a final surprise by his students, as they assemble in the auditorium as an orchestra to perform his magnum opus for the first time. And after 30 years of working on this piece of music which he brazenly calls "American Symphony"; after all that sweat and sacrifice and slaving, his magnum opus sounds like - elevator muzak! In 12/8 time, a tuneless, embarrassing, meandering piece of unmemorable laundry detergent commercial. And look at the faces on the crowd: inspired, majestic, flavor bursting in your mouth not in your hand. MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS is a cry for art, a plea for creativity, a pledge against mediocrity - and The "American Symphony" is the turd in the swimming pool of musical appreciation. It is blathered quite overtly that Mr. Holland's true opus is the collective education of his students over the years. THEY are his masterpiece... Thank Christ! For a moment, we thought we'd have to continue to hold our "inspired" faces for your laundry detergent commercial...

    This moving drama about a mans thirty year teaching career came out in a decade dominated by big budget action films.It may not have been big news at the box office compared with some films,yet never the less found a place in peoples hearts.Mr Hollands Opus is also one of the best films about a teacher who has a bigger impact on their students than they think. In some ways it could be an updated version of Goodbye Mr Chips.We follow a man who doesn't really want to teach at first and is considered a bit distant,yet as the years progress he becomes dearly loved and he adores his job. Moving seamlessly from the mid 60's through to 1995 it covers events like Vietnam,Robert Kennedy's assassination and John Lennon's murder.It manages to pull off a neat trick in never feeling rushed,even though it doesn't dwell in one decade longer than the others. Directed by Stephen Herek,with a moving script by Patrick Sheane Duncan.Mr Holland's Opus stars Richard Dreyfuss as aspiring musician Glenn Holland who becomes the temporary music teacher at the John F. Kennedy High School.At first he sees the job as nothing but a pay check but over time he grows to love it more than anything else.Beginning in the mid 1960's the film moves across the period of thirty years in the job. He also earns the wrath of the cautious deputy head teacher Mr.Wolters(William H.Macy)when he spices things up in the music room by playing the students rock and roll as opposed to just classical(so he can get them interested in the subject). We also share the joy and sadness which make up his private life,his loving and endlessly patient wife Iris(Glenne Headly)and his deaf son Cole(Anthony Natale).His inability for a while to accept Coles condition lead shim to devote more time to his students and soon he must choose between his family or his teaching but it is not an easy choice for him. Dreyfuss is tailor made for the role,giving a subtle and moving performance his Mr Holland is a quiet but strong and determined man who's love for music transfers easily to his students over the years. There's fine support from Jay Thomas as football coach Bill Meister who becomes a close friend of Glenn and Olympia Dukakis as Principle Jacobs,Alicia Witt as one of Hollands greatest achievements as a teacher the shy Gertrude Lang who's struggle to play perfect music is one of many moving subplots.And Jean Louise Kelly shines as singing student Rowena Morgan,who has a crush on Mr Holland and has a love of music matched only by his. Uplifting and deeply moving,this is a must see for anyone who's had a teacher that meant so much to them and even influenced their career. For those who were around during the 60's and 70's it's a trip down music memory lane.With tunes like Louie Louie and Imagine making the soundtrack it's an upbeat and joyful experience for anyone who loves music in any form.

    Mr Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is a frustrated musician and composer. He is frustrated at his teaching job. It was supposed to be temporary to pay the bills. But the years pass, his life passes, and he feels he has achieved nothing. But what he discovers is that his life has meaning for all those he has touched over years. This is definitely one of those feel good movies. The individual stories are memorable. The feeling of lost palpable. The moment when he finally connects with his deaf child. That was powerful. All the stories are poignant. Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly suited as the old disillusioned teacher. It's a good cry movie all the way.

    Oh for goodness sake. Would all musicians complaining about the music kindly stuff off. I play a bit of rugby but still thoroughly enjoyed "Invictus" despite some ropey rugby sequences. This film is not about the music. This is the wonderful story of an ordinary man who strived to be something extraordinary and always felt as though he had let himself and his family down by not becoming the man he felt he should have been, when in fact he became so much more extraordinary than he could ever have imagined. Mr Holland's opus WASN'T the music, his opus was his pupils and the impression he made on their lives, and the final scene, with his realisation that his life hadn't been wasted is one of the most moving things I have ever seen on screen. So there. I am a big girls blouse.

    Mr. Holland's Opus is a lovely and engaging film about a musician and composer forced by life to get a 'real job'. The movie skillfully takes place over many decades and is tied together by the music of each generation. Filled with all the emotions and decisions we each must deal with every day, Mr. Holland's Opus explores what it means to have your dreams conflict with your reality with results ranging from frustration to melancholy to joy. Heartfelt without pandering or being overly sappy I think this will appeal to watchers of all ages, especially those who had someone in their life who left an everlasting trace.

    This is a lovely film about a teacher's career and dreams that never get fulfilled. In the beginning he has to take a teaching job in a high school, with hopes to earn enough to later concentrate on his true love in life, composing. This dream never comes true as the four years that he's planning to teach become thirty years. The magnificent classical piece heard during the opening credits, the grand opus he's dreaming one day to compose, never becomes reality; instead, at the end of the film we hear a considerably different, "inferior" piece as a deliberate contrast, but in the end it doesn't matter to him - he has found his true fulfillment in life in inspiring his students to love music, within the confines of the high school world. One point off for the length, but otherwise highly recommended and heartwarming, tastefully directed movie.

    I enjoyed this film in its initial theatrical run, then repeated viewings. Just recently (I don't have it on DVD yet) it came on TV so I recorded it as my teenage boys haven't seen it. So my wife, the boys and I watched it together and enjoyed it. Great performances all around, especially for Richard Dreyfuss. He was fantastic as the composer-turned-high school music teacher. A wonderful blend of drama and comedy! Having the historic aspect of world events was a terrific idea. I would say another reason we enjoyed the film was how it presented teaching.....that it can be done in other ways to get across to students. The soundtrack for the film was also chosen well!

    *** out of **** A heartfelt performance by Richard Dreyfuss is the strongest asset of this good, though not great, movie. Dreyfuss was nominated for Best Actor in playing Glenn Holland, a young man who dreams of one day completing a memorable piece of great classical music. In order to make ends meet and feed his wife and deaf son, he must lower his standards by taking on a frustrating teacher's job at a high school. Holland initially has a tough time trying to interest his lethargic students in music appreciation, but his efforts ultimately pay off as he begins to make a difference in their lives. Spanning a period of 30 years from about 1965 to 1995, the film does not successfully realize that transition as well as it might have. For example, I was able to spot a number of chronological errors in how the montage of passing years was represented. But one personal highlight in the film for me involved Holland's devastation upon learning of the murder of John Lennon in 1980.
