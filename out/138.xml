    Where to start. I've watched this a few times and it is just terrible. The hockey isn't even realistic. You would think owning an NHL team would have made Disney a little more aware of how the game works. The games aren't even remotely realistic. The varsity team is a joke. They can skate around and make a lot of plays that should be penalties, but they get away with them. One of the worst actors in this movie is the varsity head coach. He really overacts and his lines sound As always the ducks are underdogs and for some reason can't beat the big bad varsity who isn't really impressive. I found one of the most annoying characters besides the varsity coach is the announcer for the games. That kid has no acting talent and he must be a relative of someone at Disney which got him the role. Let's not forget Charlie crying all the time about losing his C. A real leader doesn't need a C on his jersey to lead. It looks like Eden Hall is supposed to resemble Shattuck St Mary's in Minnesota which is a well known hockey high school. I could go on and on forever. This movie isn't as bad as the 2nd one, but it sure gives it a run for its money.

    Okay, I have one problem with this movie: when you win the world championship in the Olympics then go to college, guess what? You get to skip JV and advance straight to varsity. Especially if nearly the whole Olympic squad goes to the same school. Seriously, they have something to prove to the college coach? Um, watch some game tape of them winning the WORLD FREAKIN' CHAMPIONSHIP! Also, you're fired. Obviously this is a completely ridiculous movie franchise - shenanigans and tomfoolery are the very bedrock of the franchise - but I still can't get past that hang-up. It's even worse than the knuckle-puck from D2 (every hockey fan hates the knuckle-puck).

    I fully understand that D3: Mighty Ducks is a kids movie, but still, this could be the worst film I have ever seen. The premise is absolutely ridiculous and downright bizarre. I am confused as to how a screenplay can be approved that calls for such a plot line. I'm not going to get too far into it, but the SOLD OUT exhibition contest between the freshman team (the Ducks) and the varsity will go down in cinematic history as one of the most dubious acts ever put on film. You'll have to see it to believe it. The school, which is supposed to foster fair play and excellence, encourages the varsity to resent the freshman to the point that only a hateful exhibition between the two teams can settle the matter. And oh yeah, the freshman (our heroes) somehow raise enough money in time to purchase brand new uniforms for the meaningless game. And after they win, the school instantly changes its official mascot to...you guessed it...the Ducks!!! Here is an overview of some of the aspects that irritate me about this film: -The meaningless scrimmage between the varsity and freshman is 100 percent sold out and broadcasted on the radio with an NHL superstar as a between period guest. -There are too many blatant hockey infractions during the scrimmage to count. -One of the varsity players is flipped over the boards and falls into the crowd as the glass shatters, which is completely impossible. -The varsity hates the freshman even though they are all part of the same hockey program. Why would you resent a team that will someday carry on the rich hockey tradition that you helped establish? -The new uniforms! Again, what is the logic in raising THOUSANDS of dollars to purchase uniforms for a game that doesn't even count. OK, maybe they are from a previous season. Still, why not show a little school pride and wear the uniforms assigned to you? For a group desperately trying to fit in, refusing to wear the institution's uniforms is a slap in the face. -The school apparently was planning on the freshman winning because after the game (scrimmage), a large Mighty Ducks banner is unveiled displaying the academy's new mascot...the Ducks. Wow! I don't think I need to elaborate on that one. -Why are the scholarships being pulled? The only hint we are given is because the kids don't quite fit in. Are you serious? -The over-the-top cheesiness of the ending. There is way too much making out and kissing. Not to mention the dumb scene where coach slaps the captain's "C" on one of the two players that had previously abandoned the team.

    Starting with the good things, it is nicely filmed with crisp cinematography and nice scenery. The soundtrack is great, and Jeffrey Nordling steps into the coach's shoes with enthusiasm with Emilio Estevez making a brief appearance. The Mighty Ducks themselves are performed with real spirit also and the few ice hockey scenes are well choreographed. However, where the film is lacking is in the plot, the plot weren't the greatest in the first two films but here it was really predictable and uninspired coupled with uneven pacing. And while I liked the scripting in the first two, it is fairly weak here. Joss Ackland's role is rather cartoonish, more to do with how the character was written rather than acted, and the direction is nothing special. Overall, merely average and worth seeing, but there are a few components here that make it the weakest of the franchise. 5/10 Bethany Cox

    D3 was the bomb!It was better than the first.After spending time in the off season Coach Bombay (Emilio Estevez) rounds the kids up to get back on the "ice and start" from there. Also a new posse joins the squad and together they become team "USA" and compete against teams all over the world including the seemingly unstoppable Team Iceland.Oh yeah and before I forget another member joins the Team U.S.A/Ducks also-Russ Tyler(played by Kenan Thompson from Kenan & Kel)who was the player with the famous "knuckle puck" hit that usually did some serious damge. Buena Vista (the company that releases Disney films on DVD) chose to NOT release anamorphic DVDs when they first came to DVD, so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced. This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on top and bottom of the picture. Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?! I don't know about you guys, but I am a Mighty Duck fan who is disappointed by the DVD release of this film. Trust me on this one, this is one movie that will have you "quacking" all over the place with laughs.

    People say this movie is bad, it hasn't got the meat that the two other sequels had, and that is somewhat also true, but in some way also a little untrue, let me emphasize. This is the ending to the trilogy, and with being the ending it has got to have something that we all can relate to if we have seen the others,the movie could almost be a complete failure but isn't really, the reasons it isn't are here. 1. Cast members all return or at least most of the cast members, and even Hans revisited which was one of my favorite in the first movie. 2. It still is about the game, this movie was made to represent a decade of hockey and it does. 3. there aren't other reasons but his one is the biggest, the ending shot where Emilio walks out of the screen is perfect, it is how to end a decade, and he does it so well, that is the biggest reason without that shot it would've lost all magic, or and of course the last shot from the first movie. Other then that i haven't much more to say, the money shot was the ending with Emilio and that was how I truly got pulled together and how the ending fitted perfect to a decade of hockey, goo all Ducks fly away now, and thrive to find another place, cool edition because of ending...!!!

    In "D3: The Mighty Ducks," the same old cast of characters returns for some more good old times on the ice. The scrappy, wise-cracking kids that formed The Mighty Ducks hockey team are now full-blown teenagers, voice-changes and all. This time around, they are awarded scholarships to the prestigious Eden Hall Academy, a school who take their hockey just a bit too seriously. Emilio Estevez's character is written out of most of the movie, making way for the hard-headed Coach Orion (Jeff Nordling), who leads The Ducks under their new moniker, The Warriors. As they fight for dominance with the varsity team, they also have to fight for their right to stay in school, lest the school board revoke their scholarships and cast them out simply for not fitting in. Along the way they learn more valuable life lessons and grow with one another, yada yada yada, so on and so forth. If it feels like the formula is wearing thin, that's because it is. Don't be mistaken, "D3" is of the same caliber as "D2: The Mighty Ducks." It's an entertaining enough, simple and nostalgic sports flick that appeals to the whole family, but is nowhere near as inspiring and as spirited as the original. When compared to the original "The Mighty Ducks," this is just a ho-hum sequel that offers nothing new and is obviously made with intentions of milking a franchise name, which is made abundantly clear by its low budget look. But when it comes to Disney and its track-record for sequels, would you expect anything less? It's not all bad though. The acting from the kids is spot on and their chemistry is great as usual. Hans (Joss Ackland) makes his return to the series and even though Emilio Estevez looks tired in the twenty minutes or so he spends in the film, it's better than not having him at all. His turn as the Ducks' lawyer is a stand-out, a nice call-back to the original film. Overall, "D3: The Mighty Ducks" is a contradiction, a mediocre display of nostalgia. It's entertaining enough, but too bland to really have a lasting effect. See it if only to complete the "trilogy" (although I get the feeling that if Disney felt they could, they would have forced more movies out of it) and to reminisce in the good old days, before Emilio Estevez faded away completely, before Joshua Jackson became irritating and before Kenan Thompson went SNL.

    "Another thing was what was up with the 9-0 comeback?" that is possible i played some bantam hockey games where the periods are 12 minutes each and we score 10 goals or so in a period a few times. it is possible. we beat one team 24 to 6. this was a good movie though. i missed Portman and Bombay. i actually want to get a replica of the jerseys. if you can help me find one let me know. the varsity is played by the same guys as the hawks in the first movie. they have such different personalities. this is a very good movie. i recommend it.

    Unlike many other people I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the lesson that "there comes a time when you must let things go" was well conveyed. Charlie learns that, even though "the ducks" were the best thing that has ever happened in his life, great things can end and began again in a different way. D3 had quite a few coming of age lessons that is tried to teach from misjudging people to contemplating your future. (spoiler) When Hans died I cried and cried. Over all it was my favorite Mighty Ducks movie. Yea Emilio Esteves was not in most of it but that was just another part of a lesson they were trying to teach

    I have to say that I believe all three of the Mighty Ducks movies are fantastic, and the third one is especially great. Although I am no critic, I can honestly say as an average person who grew up in the 90's that this movie is a lot of fun. It starts out with the same team from the second movie (excluding Jesse Hall) receiving scholarships to a hockey-championship-winning high school. The school's varsity team immediately shows their disdain for the Ducks, and the varsity and the ducks continue their rivalry throughout the movie with outrageous pranks that finally ends with the big showdown hockey game. The rivalry between the two teams is what makes the movie most memorable, with pranks that make you laugh (although they seem incredibly unbelievable and over-the-top). The return of the actors from the second movie is wonderful, it is the exact same team, except for Hall which was mentioned above. Also, Emilio Estevez returns as Gordon Bombay although in a much smaller and less-involved role. Still, less of Bombay is better than no Bombay. The new coach, Orien, is an interesting character who clashes with Charlie Conway, again played by Joshua Jackson. Another great factor in the third movie is the return of Hans from the first movie, and his death leads to possibly the most touching moment in all three Ducks movies. And of course, it wouldn't be a great Ducks movie without the return of characters like the Bash Brothers. Portman returning at the end made the entire movie for me, personally. While many people may think that this movie was a poor sequel that had none of the charm of the first two movies, I have to strongly disagree. I first saw the movie as a kid when it came out and I loved it for its goofiness and memorable characters. Now, as a young adult, I own all three of the movies and still enjoy watching them with my friends. I'd recommend them to anyone and everyone.

D3 had quite a few coming of age lessons that is tried to teach from misjudging people to contemplating your future. (spoiler) When Hans died I cried and cried. Over all it was my favorite Mighty Ducks movie. Yea Emilio Esteves was not in most of it but that was just another part of a lesson they were trying to teach

    I have to say that I believe all three of the Mighty Ducks movies are fantastic, and the third one is especially great. Although I am no critic, I can honestly say as an average person who grew up in the 90's that this movie is a lot of fun. It starts out with the same team from the second movie (excluding Jesse Hall) receiving scholarships to a hockey-championship-winning high school. The school's varsity team immediately shows their disdain for the Ducks, and the varsity and the ducks continue their rivalry throughout the movie with outrageous pranks that finally ends with the big showdown hockey game. The rivalry between the two teams is what makes the movie most memorable, with pranks that make you laugh (although they seem incredibly unbelievable and over-the-top). The return of the actors from the second movie is wonderful, it is the exact same team, except for Hall which was mentioned above. Also, Emilio Estevez returns as Gordon Bombay although in a much smaller and less-involved role. Still, less of Bombay is better than no Bombay. The new coach, Orien, is an interesting character who clashes with Charlie Conway, again played by Joshua Jackson. Another great factor in the third movie is the return of Hans from the first movie, and his death leads to possibly the most touching moment in all three Ducks movies. And of course, it wouldn't be a great Ducks movie without the return of characters like the Bash Brothers. Portman returning at the end made the entire movie for me, personally. While many people may think that this movie was a poor sequel that had none of the charm of the first two movies, I have to strongly disagree. I first saw the movie as a kid when it came out and I loved it for its goofiness and memorable characters. Now, as a young adult, I own all three of the movies and still enjoy watching them with my friends. I'd recommend them to anyone and everyone.

    Where to start. I've watched this a few times and it is just terrible. The hockey isn't even realistic. You would think owning an NHL team would have made Disney a little more aware of how the game works. The games aren't even remotely realistic. The varsity team is a joke. They can skate around and make a lot of plays that should be penalties, but they get away with them. One of the worst actors in this movie is the varsity head coach. He really overacts and his lines sound As always the ducks are underdogs and for some reason can't beat the big bad varsity who isn't really impressive. I found one of the most annoying characters besides the varsity coach is the announcer for the games. That kid has no acting talent and he must be a relative of someone at Disney which got him the role. Let's not forget Charlie crying all the time about losing his C. A real leader doesn't need a C on his jersey to lead. It looks like Eden Hall is supposed to resemble Shattuck St Mary's in Minnesota which is a well known hockey high school. I could go on and on forever. This movie isn't as bad as the 2nd one, but it sure gives it a run for its money.

    Okay, I have one problem with this movie: when you win the world championship in the Olympics then go to college, guess what? You get to skip JV and advance straight to varsity. Especially if nearly the whole Olympic squad goes to the same school. Seriously, they have something to prove to the college coach? Um, watch some game tape of them winning the WORLD FREAKIN' CHAMPIONSHIP! Also, you're fired. Obviously this is a completely ridiculous movie franchise - shenanigans and tomfoolery are the very bedrock of the franchise - but I still can't get past that hang-up. It's even worse than the knuckle-puck from D2 (every hockey fan hates the knuckle-puck).

    I fully understand that D3: Mighty Ducks is a kids movie, but still, this could be the worst film I have ever seen. The premise is absolutely ridiculous and downright bizarre. I am confused as to how a screenplay can be approved that calls for such a plot line. I'm not going to get too far into it, but the SOLD OUT exhibition contest between the freshman team (the Ducks) and the varsity will go down in cinematic history as one of the most dubious acts ever put on film. You'll have to see it to believe it. The school, which is supposed to foster fair play and excellence, encourages the varsity to resent the freshman to the point that only a hateful exhibition between the two teams can settle the matter. And oh yeah, the freshman (our heroes) somehow raise enough money in time to purchase brand new uniforms for the meaningless game. And after they win, the school instantly changes its official mascot to...you guessed it...the Ducks!!! Here is an overview of some of the aspects that irritate me about this film: -The meaningless scrimmage between the varsity and freshman is 100 percent sold out and broadcasted on the radio with an NHL superstar as a between period guest. -There are too many blatant hockey infractions during the scrimmage to count. -One of the varsity players is flipped over the boards and falls into the crowd as the glass shatters, which is completely impossible. -The varsity hates the freshman even though they are all part of the same hockey program. Why would you resent a team that will someday carry on the rich hockey tradition that you helped establish? -The new uniforms! Again, what is the logic in raising THOUSANDS of dollars to purchase uniforms for a game that doesn't even count. OK, maybe they are from a previous season. Still, why not show a little school pride and wear the uniforms assigned to you? For a group desperately trying to fit in, refusing to wear the institution's uniforms is a slap in the face. -The school apparently was planning on the freshman winning because after the game (scrimmage), a large Mighty Ducks banner is unveiled displaying the academy's new mascot...the Ducks. Wow! I don't think I need to elaborate on that one. -Why are the scholarships being pulled? The only hint we are given is because the kids don't quite fit in. Are you serious? -The over-the-top cheesiness of the ending. There is way too much making out and kissing. Not to mention the dumb scene where coach slaps the captain's "C" on one of the two players that had previously abandoned the team.

    Starting with the good things, it is nicely filmed with crisp cinematography and nice scenery. The soundtrack is great, and Jeffrey Nordling steps into the coach's shoes with enthusiasm with Emilio Estevez making a brief appearance. The Mighty Ducks themselves are performed with real spirit also and the few ice hockey scenes are well choreographed. However, where the film is lacking is in the plot, the plot weren't the greatest in the first two films but here it was really predictable and uninspired coupled with uneven pacing. And while I liked the scripting in the first two, it is fairly weak here. Joss Ackland's role is rather cartoonish, more to do with how the character was written rather than acted, and the direction is nothing special. Overall, merely average and worth seeing, but there are a few components here that make it the weakest of the franchise. 5/10 Bethany Cox

    D3 was the bomb!It was better than the first.After spending time in the off season Coach Bombay (Emilio Estevez) rounds the kids up to get back on the "ice and start" from there. Also a new posse joins the squad and together they become team "USA" and compete against teams all over the world including the seemingly unstoppable Team Iceland.Oh yeah and before I forget another member joins the Team U.S.A/Ducks also-Russ Tyler(played by Kenan Thompson from Kenan & Kel)who was the player with the famous "knuckle puck" hit that usually did some serious damge. Buena Vista (the company that releases Disney films on DVD) chose to NOT release anamorphic DVDs when they first came to DVD, so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced. This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on top and bottom of the picture. Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?! I don't know about you guys, but I am a Mighty Duck fan who is disappointed by the DVD release of this film. Trust me on this one, this is one movie that will have you "quacking" all over the place with laughs.

    People say this movie is bad, it hasn't got the meat that the two other sequels had, and that is somewhat also true, but in some way also a little untrue, let me emphasize. This is the ending to the trilogy, and with being the ending it has got to have something that we all can relate to if we have seen the others,the movie could almost be a complete failure but isn't really, the reasons it isn't are here. 1. Cast members all return or at least most of the cast members, and even Hans revisited which was one of my favorite in the first movie. 2. It still is about the game, this movie was made to represent a decade of hockey and it does. 3. there aren't other reasons but his one is the biggest, the ending shot where Emilio walks out of the screen is perfect, it is how to end a decade, and he does it so well, that is the biggest reason without that shot it would've lost all magic, or and of course the last shot from the first movie. Other then that i haven't much more to say, the money shot was the ending with Emilio and that was how I truly got pulled together and how the ending fitted perfect to a decade of hockey, goo all Ducks fly away now, and thrive to find another place, cool edition because of ending...!!!

    In "D3: The Mighty Ducks," the same old cast of characters returns for some more good old times on the ice. The scrappy, wise-cracking kids that formed The Mighty Ducks hockey team are now full-blown teenagers, voice-changes and all. This time around, they are awarded scholarships to the prestigious Eden Hall Academy, a school who take their hockey just a bit too seriously. Emilio Estevez's character is written out of most of the movie, making way for the hard-headed Coach Orion (Jeff Nordling), who leads The Ducks under their new moniker, The Warriors. As they fight for dominance with the varsity team, they also have to fight for their right to stay in school, lest the school board revoke their scholarships and cast them out simply for not fitting in. Along the way they learn more valuable life lessons and grow with one another, yada yada yada, so on and so forth. If it feels like the formula is wearing thin, that's because it is. Don't be mistaken, "D3" is of the same caliber as "D2: The Mighty Ducks." It's an entertaining enough, simple and nostalgic sports flick that appeals to the whole family, but is nowhere near as inspiring and as spirited as the original. When compared to the original "The Mighty Ducks," this is just a ho-hum sequel that offers nothing new and is obviously made with intentions of milking a franchise name, which is made abundantly clear by its low budget look. But when it comes to Disney and its track-record for sequels, would you expect anything less? It's not all bad though. The acting from the kids is spot on and their chemistry is great as usual. Hans (Joss Ackland) makes his return to the series and even though Emilio Estevez looks tired in the twenty minutes or so he spends in the film, it's better than not having him at all. His turn as the Ducks' lawyer is a stand-out, a nice call-back to the original film. Overall, "D3: The Mighty Ducks" is a contradiction, a mediocre display of nostalgia. It's entertaining enough, but too bland to really have a lasting effect. See it if only to complete the "trilogy" (although I get the feeling that if Disney felt they could, they would have forced more movies out of it) and to reminisce in the good old days, before Emilio Estevez faded away completely, before Joshua Jackson became irritating and before Kenan Thompson went SNL.

    "Another thing was what was up with the 9-0 comeback?" that is possible i played some bantam hockey games where the periods are 12 minutes each and we score 10 goals or so in a period a few times. it is possible. we beat one team 24 to 6. this was a good movie though. i missed Portman and Bombay. i actually want to get a replica of the jerseys. if you can help me find one let me know. the varsity is played by the same guys as the hawks in the first movie. they have such different personalities. this is a very good movie. i recommend it.

    Unlike many other people I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the lesson that "there comes a time when you must let things go" was well conveyed. Charlie learns that, even though "the ducks" were the best thing that has ever happened in his life, great things can end and began again in a different way. D3 had quite a few coming of age lessons that is tried to teach from misjudging people to contemplating your future. (spoiler) When Hans died I cried and cried. Over all it was my favorite Mighty Ducks movie. Yea Emilio Esteves was not in most of it but that was just another part of a lesson they were trying to teach

    I have to say that I believe all three of the Mighty Ducks movies are fantastic, and the third one is especially great. Although I am no critic, I can honestly say as an average person who grew up in the 90's that this movie is a lot of fun. It starts out with the same team from the second movie (excluding Jesse Hall) receiving scholarships to a hockey-championship-winning high school. The school's varsity team immediately shows their disdain for the Ducks, and the varsity and the ducks continue their rivalry throughout the movie with outrageous pranks that finally ends with the big showdown hockey game. The rivalry between the two teams is what makes the movie most memorable, with pranks that make you laugh (although they seem incredibly unbelievable and over-the-top). The return of the actors from the second movie is wonderful, it is the exact same team, except for Hall which was mentioned above. Also, Emilio Estevez returns as Gordon Bombay although in a much smaller and less-involved role. Still, less of Bombay is better than no Bombay. The new coach, Orien, is an interesting character who clashes with Charlie Conway, again played by Joshua Jackson. Another great factor in the third movie is the return of Hans from the first movie, and his death leads to possibly the most touching moment in all three Ducks movies. And of course, it wouldn't be a great Ducks movie without the return of characters like the Bash Brothers. Portman returning at the end made the entire movie for me, personally. While many people may think that this movie was a poor sequel that had none of the charm of the first two movies, I have to strongly disagree. I first saw the movie as a kid when it came out and I loved it for its goofiness and memorable characters. Now, as a young adult, I own all three of the movies and still enjoy watching them with my friends. I'd recommend them to anyone and everyone.

    Where to start. I've watched this a few times and it is just terrible. The hockey isn't even realistic. You would think owning an NHL team would have made Disney a little more aware of how the game works. The games aren't even remotely realistic. The varsity team is a joke. They can skate around and make a lot of plays that should be penalties, but they get away with them. One of the worst actors in this movie is the varsity head coach. He really overacts and his lines sound As always the ducks are underdogs and for some reason can't beat the big bad varsity who isn't really impressive. I found one of the most annoying characters besides the varsity coach is the announcer for the games. That kid has no acting talent and he must be a relative of someone at Disney which got him the role. Let's not forget Charlie crying all the time about losing his C. A real leader doesn't need a C on his jersey to lead. It looks like Eden Hall is supposed to resemble Shattuck St Mary's in Minnesota which is a well known hockey high school. I could go on and on forever. This movie isn't as bad as the 2nd one, but it sure gives it a run for its money.

    Okay, I have one problem with this movie: when you win the world championship in the Olympics then go to college, guess what? You get to skip JV and advance straight to varsity. Especially if nearly the whole Olympic squad goes to the same school. Seriously, they have something to prove to the college coach? Um, watch some game tape of them winning the WORLD FREAKIN' CHAMPIONSHIP! Also, you're fired. Obviously this is a completely ridiculous movie franchise - shenanigans and tomfoolery are the very bedrock of the franchise - but I still can't get past that hang-up. It's even worse than the knuckle-puck from D2 (every hockey fan hates the knuckle-puck).

    I fully understand that D3: Mighty Ducks is a kids movie, but still, this could be the worst film I have ever seen. The premise is absolutely ridiculous and downright bizarre. I am confused as to how a screenplay can be approved that calls for such a plot line. I'm not going to get too far into it, but the SOLD OUT exhibition contest between the freshman team (the Ducks) and the varsity will go down in cinematic history as one of the most dubious acts ever put on film. You'll have to see it to believe it. The school, which is supposed to foster fair play and excellence, encourages the varsity to resent the freshman to the point that only a hateful exhibition between the two teams can settle the matter. And oh yeah, the freshman (our heroes) somehow raise enough money in time to purchase brand new uniforms for the meaningless game. And after they win, the school instantly changes its official mascot to...you guessed it...the Ducks!!! Here is an overview of some of the aspects that irritate me about this film: -The meaningless scrimmage between the varsity and freshman is 100 percent sold out and broadcasted on the radio with an NHL superstar as a between period guest. -There are too many blatant hockey infractions during the scrimmage to count. -One of the varsity players is flipped over the boards and falls into the crowd as the glass shatters, which is completely impossible. -The varsity hates the freshman even though they are all part of the same hockey program. Why would you resent a team that will someday carry on the rich hockey tradition that you helped establish? -The new uniforms! Again, what is the logic in raising THOUSANDS of dollars to purchase uniforms for a game that doesn't even count. OK, maybe they are from a previous season. Still, why not show a little school pride and wear the uniforms assigned to you? For a group desperately trying to fit in, refusing to wear the institution's uniforms is a slap in the face. -The school apparently was planning on the freshman winning because after the game (scrimmage), a large Mighty Ducks banner is unveiled displaying the academy's new mascot...the Ducks. Wow! I don't think I need to elaborate on that one. -Why are the scholarships being pulled? The only hint we are given is because the kids don't quite fit in. Are you serious? -The over-the-top cheesiness of the ending. There is way too much making out and kissing. Not to mention the dumb scene where coach slaps the captain's "C" on one of the two players that had previously abandoned the team.

    Starting with the good things, it is nicely filmed with crisp cinematography and nice scenery. The soundtrack is great, and Jeffrey Nordling steps into the coach's shoes with enthusiasm with Emilio Estevez making a brief appearance. The Mighty Ducks themselves are performed with real spirit also and the few ice hockey scenes are well choreographed. However, where the film is lacking is in the plot, the plot weren't the greatest in the first two films but here it was really predictable and uninspired coupled with uneven pacing. And while I liked the scripting in the first two, it is fairly weak here. Joss Ackland's role is rather cartoonish, more to do with how the character was written rather than acted, and the direction is nothing special. Overall, merely average and worth seeing, but there are a few components here that make it the weakest of the franchise. 5/10 Bethany Cox

    D3 was the bomb!It was better than the first.After spending time in the off season Coach Bombay (Emilio Estevez) rounds the kids up to get back on the "ice and start" from there. Also a new posse joins the squad and together they become team "USA" and compete against teams all over the world including the seemingly unstoppable Team Iceland.Oh yeah and before I forget another member joins the Team U.S.A/Ducks also-Russ Tyler(played by Kenan Thompson from Kenan & Kel)who was the player with the famous "knuckle puck" hit that usually did some serious damge. Buena Vista (the company that releases Disney films on DVD) chose to NOT release anamorphic DVDs when they first came to DVD, so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced. This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on top and bottom of the picture. Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?! I don't know about you guys, but I am a Mighty Duck fan who is disappointed by the DVD release of this film. Trust me on this one, this is one movie that will have you "quacking" all over the place with laughs.

    People say this movie is bad, it hasn't got the meat that the two other sequels had, and that is somewhat also true, but in some way also a little untrue, let me emphasize. This is the ending to the trilogy, and with being the ending it has got to have something that we all can relate to if we have seen the others,the movie could almost be a complete failure but isn't really, the reasons it isn't are here. 1. Cast members all return or at least most of the cast members, and even Hans revisited which was one of my favorite in the first movie. 2. It still is about the game, this movie was made to represent a decade of hockey and it does. 3. there aren't other reasons but his one is the biggest, the ending shot where Emilio walks out of the screen is perfect, it is how to end a decade, and he does it so well, that is the biggest reason without that shot it would've lost all magic, or and of course the last shot from the first movie. Other then that i haven't much more to say, the money shot was the ending with Emilio and that was how I truly got pulled together and how the ending fitted perfect to a decade of hockey, goo all Ducks fly away now, and thrive to find another place, cool edition because of ending...!!!

    In "D3: The Mighty Ducks," the same old cast of characters returns for some more good old times on the ice. The scrappy, wise-cracking kids that formed The Mighty Ducks hockey team are now full-blown teenagers, voice-changes and all. This time around, they are awarded scholarships to the prestigious Eden Hall Academy, a school who take their hockey just a bit too seriously. Emilio Estevez's character is written out of most of the movie, making way for the hard-headed Coach Orion (Jeff Nordling), who leads The Ducks under their new moniker, The Warriors. As they fight for dominance with the varsity team, they also have to fight for their right to stay in school, lest the school board revoke their scholarships and cast them out simply for not fitting in. Along the way they learn more valuable life lessons and grow with one another, yada yada yada, so on and so forth. If it feels like the formula is wearing thin, that's because it is. Don't be mistaken, "D3" is of the same caliber as "D2: The Mighty Ducks." It's an entertaining enough, simple and nostalgic sports flick that appeals to the whole family, but is nowhere near as inspiring and as spirited as the original. When compared to the original "The Mighty Ducks," this is just a ho-hum sequel that offers nothing new and is obviously made with intentions of milking a franchise name, which is made abundantly clear by its low budget look. But when it comes to Disney and its track-record for sequels, would you expect anything less? It's not all bad though. The acting from the kids is spot on and their chemistry is great as usual. Hans (Joss Ackland) makes his return to the series and even though Emilio Estevez looks tired in the twenty minutes or so he spends in the film, it's better than not having him at all. His turn as the Ducks' lawyer is a stand-out, a nice call-back to the original film. Overall, "D3: The Mighty Ducks" is a contradiction, a mediocre display of nostalgia. It's entertaining enough, but too bland to really have a lasting effect. See it if only to complete the "trilogy" (although I get the feeling that if Disney felt they could, they would have forced more movies out of it) and to reminisce in the good old days, before Emilio Estevez faded away completely, before Joshua Jackson became irritating and before Kenan Thompson went SNL.

    "Another thing was what was up with the 9-0 comeback?" that is possible i played some bantam hockey games where the periods are 12 minutes each and we score 10 goals or so in a period a few times. it is possible. we beat one team 24 to 6. this was a good movie though. i missed Portman and Bombay. i actually want to get a replica of the jerseys. if you can help me find one let me know. the varsity is played by the same guys as the hawks in the first movie. they have such different personalities. this is a very good movie. i recommend it.
