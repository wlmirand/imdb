  Nick and Nora Charles, a former detective and his rich, playful wife, investigate a murder case mostly for the fun of it.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  After a four year absence, one time detective Nick Charles returns to New York with his new wife Nora and their dog, Asta. Nick re-connects with many of his old cronies, several of whom are eccentric characters, to say the least. He's also approached by Dorothy Wynant whose inventor father Clyde Wynant is suspected of murdering her step-mother. Her father had left on a planned trip some months before and she has had no contact with him. Nick isn't all that keen on resuming his former profession but egged-on by wife Nora, who thinks this all very exciting, he agrees to help out. He solves the case, announcing the identity of the killer at a dinner party for all of the suspects.

    This is the start of an excellent series of Thin Man movies with William Powell and Myrna Loy as the high class couple Nick and Nora Charles, with their dog Asta. Nick is a "retired" cop who has married the rich socialite Nora. Nick is always getting involved in cases the cops can't seem to solve and of course he does solve them. Usually using his old contacts with his old underworld buddies that he had given breaks to over the years. The repartee between the couple is pretty funny at times and Asta is a well trained dog who comes across as cowardly. Both of the Charles's like to drink and party some, my kind of people!! Most of action is fairly low keyed and I think is done to make the audience think.

    This film was based on one book, and because it was so popular it was turned into a six film series, with the lead stars returning for all of them, and this the first film is the one that appeared in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was most interested to watch it. Basically retired detective Nick Charles (Oscar nominated William Powell) and his wife Nora (Myrna Loy) are trying to settle down, but a friend of his, Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), the "thin man" of the title, disappears and may be involved in a murder, so he is pulled back into action to investigate. The man who has vanished is the prime suspect to the murder of his former secretary and girlfriend Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead) as all the evidence points to him, but the one who doesn't believe he has any involvement is his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan), and is the one who convinces the former private eye to take the case. This amuses his wife, but Nick does stumble onto some clues and pieces together the facts for an intense investigation, and he eventually comes to conclude who the murderer really is, but he is not telling anybody his findings until an event he is putting on. All the guests he is inviting are the ones he believes are capable of murder, but he knows only one really did the crime, and a classic dinner party scene, and with explanations of each person's involvement in the recent events, including the skeleton body of missing Mynant found who was killed for his money. Also starring Nat Pendleton as Inspector John Guild , Minna Gombell as Mimi Wynant, Porter Hall as Herbert MacCaulay, Henry Wadsworth as Tommy, William Henry as Gilbert Wynant, Harold Huber as Arthur Nunheim, Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgenson, Edward Brophy as Joe Morelli and Cyril Thornton as Tanner. Powell gives a leading performance with his clever theorising and charming wit, Loy is really likable as his wife who is by his side throughout, together they make a great duo, so it is no wonder that sequels followed, if you like mystery mixed with some good laughs then this good entertainment, a fun classic detective comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for W.S. Van Dyke, Best Picture and Best Writing, Adaptation. It was number 32 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    "The Thin Man" is a smart, sophisticated, urban whodunit staged with Spartan style and little nonsense by W.S. Van Dyke who went on to helm the first three entries in the six film franchise. This was not the first time that mustached William Powell either played a detective or paired up with Myrna Loy. They co-starred in several movies before and after "The Thin Man" series, such "Manhattan Melodrama," "The Great Ziegfeld," "Libeled Lady," "Double Wedding," "Love Crazy," "I Love You Again," and "Evelyn Prentice." This clever mystery thriller unfolds in three-acts. The suspects and the situation are laid out in crisp, expository fashion, and then we meet Nick & Nora Charles who become involved in the mystery. It seems our hero knew one of the suspects. This association draws him into the investigation. All this is capped off with a huge party that Nick throws for the suspects to smoke out the murderer. A variety of characters make up the cast. Remember, M-G-M produced this mystery back in 1934, when Hollywood couldn't depict violence with any realistic detail. As it is, "The Thin Man" looks like a drinking man's champ. Our hero guzzles and so do many others. Nick has guzzled six martinis by the time his wife joins him in the bar. This 91-minute melodrama qualifies as a Christmas movie because it occurs during the holiday season. The dialogue is often snappy, especially the being "shot five times in the tabloids." The secretary of an eccentric scientist, Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead of "The King Murder"), has been murdered. The eccentric scientist, Gilbert Wynant (William Henry of "Rubber Racketeers"), vanishes afterward without a trace. Earlier, Wynant's wife Mimi (Minna Gombell of "High Sierra") divorced him because of a fling with Ms. Wolf. Worst, the conniving secretary was up to no good under Wynant's very nose. Quietly enough, Julia had been embezzling money; she cashed in two bonds amounting to $50-thousand. Wynant catches her with a gangster, Morelli (Edward Brophy), and they quarrel about the kind of men that she ahs been seeing. Gilbert Wynant is the jealous type. Myrna Loy's entrance in the action is funny. Asta literally drags her with packages piled up in her arms. Later, Wynant's attorney Herbert MacCaulay (Porter Hall of "His Girl Friday"), inquires if Nick is sleuthing for Wynant's ex-wife. Nick informs MacCaulay he gave up being a private eye four years ago. "My wife's father died and left her a narrow gauge railway, and a lumber mill, and several other things. I'm taking care of them." When they have this conversation, Wynant has been missing for three months. The first entry in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's "Thin Man" franchise, "The Thin Man," takes about twenty minutes before Nick Charles (William Powell) makes his entrance. He is teaching bartenders how to mix various alcoholic beverages. "You see, the important thing is the rhythm. You should always have rhythm in your shaking. "A Manhattan you shake to a fox trot. A Bronx to a two-step time. A dry martini you always shake to waltzes." When he completes this elaboration lecture, Nick takes the drink that he prepared so fastidiously and sips it. Wynant's daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan of "Tarzan of the Apes") walks up to him and informs him that she remembers him from a case. Dorothy is searching for her father. Mimi goes to see Julia Wolf about getting more money. Morelli (Edward Brophy of "All Through the Night") learns about Julia's murder and barges into Nick's apartment. Morelli tries to kill Nick, and the authorities are suspicious about our hero. The police confiscate an unregistered gun and promise to ask him more questions. Nick Charles hasn't worked on a case as a private eye for four years. Since he has married Mrs. Charles, he handles his wife's considerable affairs. Eventually, Inspector John Guild (Nat Pendleton of "Trapped by Television") convinces Nick to work with them. Nora persuades Nick to take the case after the fugitive, Gilbert Wynant sends him a request to investigate the case. Reluctantly, Nick takes Asta and goes prowling in the dark. He uncovers an unidentified body in Wynant's laboratory. Meantime, the police and the press believe that Wynant has killed three people. The use of modern technology at the time helps Nick to find the answer that he is looking for but nobody else knows. Nick and Nora are a couple to watch.

    "The Thin Man" (1934) is one of the best films ever made....a great stage play made into a great movie. It was originally a stage play written by Dashiell Hammett, and no doubt retained most of Hammett's great writing when Albert Hackett and his then young wife, Frances Goodrich turned the play into a movie script. This was the first important movie where the lead romantic couple exchange in banter and "repartee" which reflected the acceptance (finally) in the 1930's the "the independent woman" (even married independent women!) in USA culture, less than two decades after women finally "got the vote." Major players and minor supporting actors in "The Thin Man" (1934) are all lovable, and that includes the villain, lawyer Herbert MacCauley, marvelously portrayed by long time movie character actor of note, Porter Hall. The story is a "Whodunit" and the audience never guesses the real culprit until the penultimate scene (the next to the last scene) when hero detective, Nick Charles (played to perfection by William Powell), hosts a grand dinner for half a dozen likely suspects (and police in attendance, too, both as tuxedo clad guests and also as waiter staffers!), and fingers the guilty guy. Many people opine that the best final scene in any movie is the one in Casablanca (1943) where Humphrey Bogart (playing "Rick Blaine") tells Claude Rains (playing the French "Prefect Of Police" who just helped Bogart and now becomes a fugitive along with Bogart) tells his new friend, and fellow accomplice, "Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship." But I think "The Thin Man" (1934) has the best final scene of all. It's a rapid fire "end of the film" portrait of the Nick and Nora Charles married couple about to get to bed in a moving railroad train private room, this in a movie which shows the two alone together in bedrooms before with nothing sexy at all happening between them. The audience sees unexpected beginnings of "married love," and the camera switches instantly to the nighttime train entering a tunnel with the "San Francisco, Here I Come" tune played brightly and zestfully. Alfred Hitchcock used the same "affectionate couple (Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint) about to get into bed together on a train, then quick switch to train entering a tunnel" at the end of "North By Northwest" (1959), but that movie ending didn't have "San Francisco, Here I Come" music along with it, and that makes all the difference! ---------------------- Written by David R.

    There wasn't any film noir at the time. There were a few early notions formed in Weimar Germany about dazed minds succumbing to control of storymakers. The femme fatale was beginning to get shape as a force in the story. And then there was the detective film; each studio run its own highly successful series, each one influenced by the one before. Fox had Charlie Chan, and less famously Peter Lorre's Mr. Moto. Monogram responded with the Chinese Mr. Wong. RKO had Withers. Warners run the Perry Mason cycle. These were more or less debonair sleuths, gentle, delicate beings, after the stereotypical notion for Sherlock Holmes. And of course The Thin Man, I believe six films in total pairing William Powell with Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, dilettantes and sleuths, also openly quoting Holmes. The game here is that the detective plot is incidental to the story and only the hook that lets all the other effects sink in. The screwball comedy, the sexual innuendo, the fashions, the wit as dry as the martinis. You may piece something together but quite apart from what sleuthing is going on; no one is really sure if the sleuth is on the case or not, including him, the clues and suspects are laid out on his living-room in the middle of a party and they're merely a lot of noise that gets in the way of sipping one martini after another. Our introduction to Nick is where he's showing waiters how to shake cocktails, foreshadowing handling of the case to us. Naturally he pieces everything together in the final explanatory denouement; a dinner party with all the suspects invited, one of them the killer. No device is more contrived these days, in part because it used to work so well. You didn't have to puzzle about any of this, or fates in control of the thing, because there were none. All you had to do was kick back and sip at all the extraordinary chintz of the sleuthing. This type of film culminates in the Maltese Falcon, incidentally also adapted from Hammett and the shift towards noir proper. The more elaborate trick there was that all the suspects were aware of a ridiculous detective film going on, and constantly switched between elated viewers and mischievous storymakers. Sam Spade's main assets were great acting and making up stories. The only mischief going on here is between Nick and Nora, who constantly wink at each other about sex they're not having - until the end. Their chemistry sizzles in a way that deep love does.

    The Thin Man (1934) was directed by W.S. Van Dyke. This picture has an extremely high IMDb weighted average of 8.1. I had great hopes for this film, which we saw at a New Year's eve showing at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman House in Rochester. I'm sorry to report that the film didn't work for me at any level. William Powell and Myrna Loy play Nick and Nora Charles. He's a former detective, she's an heiress. They are rich, glamorous, and very, very sophisticated. Powell and Loy were wildly popular in these roles, and reprised them again and again. Powell more or less looks the part, but I think Loy was miscast. She looks and acts like one of the bright, snappy, working-class women in a screwball comedy. She doesn't look or act like an heiress. A second problem I had with the film was the unending focus on alcohol consumption. Getting and being drunk was far more acceptable in society then than it is now. Even so, the film really wasn't about mystery or romance--it was about drinking. People are endlessly talking about drinking, or they're drinking, or they're holding icepacks to their heads on the morning after. Powell acts half-drunk for most of the film. (For the rest of the film he acts drunk.) I just don't find that entertaining. For me, the highlight of the evening happened before the film. The Eastman House volunteer who presented the film came dressed in a long, slinky, 1930's-style gown. She gave a witty, intelligent talk. This woman had the physical and mental attributes that would have made her a perfect Nora Charles. It's too bad that her role ended when the lights in the theater dimmed. P.S. I rarely post negative reviews of films that other IMDb reviewers have liked. That's not because I'm timid, but rather because if others liked them, I usually like them too. However, on the rare occasion when I've criticized a popular film, I've been sent some abusive personal comments. If you disagree with me, I'm happy to have you tell me so. Maybe I'll learn why other people think this film is so good. However, please don't use the opportunity to comment on my parentage, my species, or the depth of my mental inadequacies. Thanks, Red-125

    The Thin Man is directed by W.S Van Dyke,produced by Hunt Stromberg,with a screenplay written by Albert Hackett(based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett)and stars William Powell,Myrna Loy,Maureen O'Sullivan and Cesar Romero. Powell and Loy's chemistry in the film Manhattan Melodrama(1934)was so impressive that Van Dyke made sure they starred in his next film The Thin Man.It is in the Thin Man that they really shine together,both perfectly in tune with one another creating one of the most memorable screen marriages ever seen.In their hands Nick and Nora become a unique couple who not only love each other,they like each other and treat each other as complete equals. Former Private Detective Nick Charles(William Powell)returns home to New York with his new wife Nora(Myrna Loy)and the couples adorable dog Asta.Nick's approached by an old friend Dorothy Wynant(Maureen O'Sullivan)who's father Clyde(Edward Ellis)is the prime suspect in the murder of her Dorothy's stepmother.She doesn't believe the charge for a second,not just for personal intuition but for the fact her father has been missing for a while.She asks Nick to look for him and he eventually agrees to take on the case.Aided by Nora Nick sinks his teeth into the mystery of the Thin Man and at an unforgettable dinner party reveals both who the real murderer is and the fate of the missing man. One of the most discussed aspects of this film is Nick and Nora's constant drinking.Powell's laconic Nick may at times seem like an alcoholic but he is never out of control and slips back and forth between giddy charmer and active,sober sleuth with such ease your never quite sure if his drinking is all an act.In Loy's case she makes Nora's drinking seem both sophisticated and simply a natural extension of this elegant young woman's personality. The amount of booze consumed in the film truly reaches almost farcical levels at times(perhaps a nod to the Great Depression,now it's over lets live the good life).Despite that it somehow fits as an almost necessary element to the story(it's presence adds greatly to the films comedy). It's pointless watching this for the story,it's convoluted and quite frankly distracts from the relationship between Nick and Nora.It is they and not the plot,who are the films strongest point.The snappy banter between the two is expertly written,with lines often not striking the audience as funny until several seconds after they are spoken.The deep affection Nick has for Nora often doesn't require words, it's present simply in the looks the couple share,and she in turn adores him and wants to share in his work,even when danger threatens. Powell and Loy starred in several sequels and The Thin Man was obviously the inspiration for TV series such as Hart To Hart.Witty,exciting and complex you should seek out the Thin Man as soon as possible,you won't be disappointed.

    THE THIN MAN (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1934), directed by W.S. Van Dyke, from the novel by Dashiell Hammett, is a classic mystery-comedy that helped establish the careers of both its leading performers, William Powell and Myrna Loy, Powell especially, in a performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination. There have been mystery-comedies prior to this, A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT (Allied, 1933) with Ginger Rogers and Lyle Talbot as rival news reporters that immediately comes to mind, but THE THIN MAN stands in a class by itself. With the plot set in New York City at the start of the Christmas season, the ten minute prologue begins with Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), an absent-minded inventor, who discovers that his secretary, Julia Wolfe (Natalie Moorehead), with whom he has been carrying on a romancer, has stolen $50,000 worth of government bonds he's been saving for the upcoming wedding of his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan) to Andrew (Henry Wadsworth). Wynant confronts Julia with his accusations, and after learning the truth, he angrily walks out of the apartment down the dark streets alone. The story gets underway as Wynant's ex-wife, Mimi (Minna Gombell), in desperate need of money, comes to visit Julia to learn of Wynant's whereabouts. After entering the apartment, she finds her dead. Before the police are called, Mimi takes something from Julia's hand belonging to Wynant, and withholds the item as possible evidence. As for Dorothy, she suspects something terribly wrong when her father, away on a secret trip unknown even to his personal attorney, Herbert McCauley (Porter Hall), hasn't returned in time for the wedding. She soon takes her worries to Nick Charles (William Powell), a friend of the family having a time of his life drinking cocktails in a speakeasy. Nick, a former detective visiting from San Francisco with his wealthy wife, Nora (Myrna Loy), is asked to investigate. At first Nick declines, but after three additional murders take place, linking it all to gray-haired thin man, Wynant, now missing for three months, Nick, at Nora's urging, comes out of his four years of carefree living to look into the case. Along with Lieutenant John Guild (Nat Pendleton) and his dog, Asta, Nick stumbles upon some clues while investigating in Wynant's workshop, to surprising and unexpected results. Suspects in question include William Henry as Wynant's studious intellectual son, Gilbert; Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgensen, a lazy loafer living off Mimi; and Julia's gangster acquaintances played by Edward Brophy (Joe Morelli); and Harold Huber (Nunheimer), the latter being murder victim number three. Then there's Bert Roach being the overgrown crybaby guest at the Christmas Eve party wanting to use Nick's phone to call his "maw" long distance. The success or failure for any motion picture relies simply on fine scripting (Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich) and perfect casting. THE THIN MAN succeeds on those counts and chemistry by Powell and Loy. Having already some detective experience to his name, that of Philo Vance on three separate occasions, "The Canary Murder Case" 1929); "The Benson Murder Case" (1930 and "The Kennel Murder Case" (1933), Powell's Nick Charles, unlike any other detective commonly found in motion picture mysteries, is very much witty, down to earth, and of course, married. Rather than typically presenting a detective sleuthing with a male counterpart as comedy relief, a gal reporter, or very much alone, Nick Charles is assisted by Asta, his wire-haired fox terrier. Observant and clever with his deductions, Nick Charles is also quick with his responses, a fondness for liquor and fun at parties. His friends are usually ex-cons whom he's "sent up the river,"holding no grudge against him. Myrna Loy has found her true character in Nora Charles. Breaking away from the stereotype bossy spouse, she accepts her husband for what and whom he is, and equals with his enjoyment of fun and mystery combined. Great scene captures her sitting on the couch gowned in fur coat calmly watching her husband being a little boy at heart playing with the sling shot he's gotten for Christmas, shooting away the ornaments hanging on the Christmas tree one by one. As much as Nora would prefer sleuthing with him during his investigations, she seldom gets that chance. The climatic finish where Nick summons all connected with the case at the dinner gathering is well constructed in both humor and suspense. The success of THE THIN MAN not only brought forth many imitations, but five additional sequels starring Powell and Loy, along with the basis of a 1957-59 television series starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk, but nothing to compare with the 1934 original, being the most famous and revived of all the "Thin Man" presentations combined. Distributed to video cassette as early as the 1980s by MGM Home Video enclosed in plastic clam shells, cable television presentations on the Disney Channel's "Best of Hollywood" in the 1990s, Turner Classic Movies from 1994 onward, and finally DVD where this and others continue to acquire both a new audience along with those who know who the killer is but to just simply want to watch over and over again in the manner of Nick and Nora Charles, just for the fun of it.

    The Thin Man is directed by W. S. Van Dyke and co-written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. It is based on the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name. Starring are William Powell and Myrna Loy, with support coming from Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Porter Hall and Skippy as Astra the dog. William Axt scores the music and James Wong Howe is the cinematographer. Plot finds Powell and Loy as married couple, Nick and Nora Charles, he is a retired detective, she a good time heiress. Planning to finally settle down, their life is upturned when Nick is called back into detective work due to a friend's disappearance and the possibility he was also involved in a murder. Murder, malarkey and mirth are about to become the order of the day. It was the big surprise hit of 1934. Afforded only a tiny budget because studio head honcho Louis B. Mayer thought it was dud material, and ordered to be completed in under three weeks time, film made stars out of Powell and Loy and coined an impressive $2 million at the box office. Also birthing a franchise (5 film sequels and a radio and television series would follow), it's a film that has irresistible charm leaping out from every frame. It's easy to see even now why a mid 1930's audience could take so warmly to such an appealing motion picture. From the off the film was in good hands, Dyke (One-Take Woody as he was sometimes known) was an unfussy director with a keen eye for pacing and casting, both of which are things that shine through in this production. There's also considerable talent in the writing, both in the source material and with the script writers. Hammett based his witty bantering couple on himself and his relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman, this was ideal material for Hackett and Goodrich, themselves a happily married couple fondly thought of in the cut and thrust world of Hollywood. As a couple they would go on to write It's a Wonderful Life for Frank Capra and win the Pulitzer Prize for their play The Diary of Anne Frank. It stands out as a film of note because it successfully marries a murder mystery story with a screwball comedy spin, this was something new and exciting. While the believable relationship between Powell and Loy was also a breath of fresh air; a married couple deeply in love, devoted, funny, boozey and bouncing off of each other with witty repartee. It can never be overstated just how good Powell and Loy are here, true enough they are given an absolutely zinging script to work from, but the level of comedy, both in visual ticks and delivery of lines, is extraordinarily high. Small budget and a small shoot, but everything else about The Thin Man is big. Big laughs, big mystery and big love, all bundled up into a joyous bit of classic cinema. 9/10

    I saw this after I had seen some of the sequels and was a bit surprised at the very dark storyline surrounding the more light material involved with solving the mystery. In the first scene we see The Thin Man who is a scientist involved in some highly suspect work that eventually gets him killed. We see that he is not a very sympathetic individual, but he does have a soft side when it comes to his daughter. There is some evidence that he is also capable of slapping women around, as indicated in a later scene with his mistress. The first half hour's darkness works surprisingly well with the more lighter material. The sequels were more interested in the shenanigans of Nick and Nora, but here they seem more involved with the sad characters and Nick's one-liners are not as pronounced as the would be in the sequels. Nick and Nora are actually more supporting characters and that may be a bit disappointing. Furtunately, there are many comic highlights involving the geeky son, the inept police and the shrill ex-wife of the scientist. The motive of the murderer is a bit underdeveloped and the ending is a bit of a letdown. It is always the least likely suspect but watch closely and you can actually figure it out pretty quickly. The movie's pace is also a bit slower than its sequels' but that is because of the relatively new adjustment to sound and not a fault of the actors. There is almost no underscoring and that gives it a sort of creepy vibe in the dramatic scenes. Good first movie but the two first sequels were a bit more funny.

    This is the start of an excellent series of Thin Man movies with William Powell and Myrna Loy as the high class couple Nick and Nora Charles, with their dog Asta. Nick is a "retired" cop who has married the rich socialite Nora. Nick is always getting involved in cases the cops can't seem to solve and of course he does solve them. Usually using his old contacts with his old underworld buddies that he had given breaks to over the years. The repartee between the couple is pretty funny at times and Asta is a well trained dog who comes across as cowardly. Both of the Charles's like to drink and party some, my kind of people!! Most of action is fairly low keyed and I think is done to make the audience think.

    This film was based on one book, and because it was so popular it was turned into a six film series, with the lead stars returning for all of them, and this the first film is the one that appeared in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was most interested to watch it. Basically retired detective Nick Charles (Oscar nominated William Powell) and his wife Nora (Myrna Loy) are trying to settle down, but a friend of his, Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), the "thin man" of the title, disappears and may be involved in a murder, so he is pulled back into action to investigate. The man who has vanished is the prime suspect to the murder of his former secretary and girlfriend Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead) as all the evidence points to him, but the one who doesn't believe he has any involvement is his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan), and is the one who convinces the former private eye to take the case. This amuses his wife, but Nick does stumble onto some clues and pieces together the facts for an intense investigation, and he eventually comes to conclude who the murderer really is, but he is not telling anybody his findings until an event he is putting on. All the guests he is inviting are the ones he believes are capable of murder, but he knows only one really did the crime, and a classic dinner party scene, and with explanations of each person's involvement in the recent events, including the skeleton body of missing Mynant found who was killed for his money. Also starring Nat Pendleton as Inspector John Guild , Minna Gombell as Mimi Wynant, Porter Hall as Herbert MacCaulay, Henry Wadsworth as Tommy, William Henry as Gilbert Wynant, Harold Huber as Arthur Nunheim, Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgenson, Edward Brophy as Joe Morelli and Cyril Thornton as Tanner. Powell gives a leading performance with his clever theorising and charming wit, Loy is really likable as his wife who is by his side throughout, together they make a great duo, so it is no wonder that sequels followed, if you like mystery mixed with some good laughs then this good entertainment, a fun classic detective comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for W.S. Van Dyke, Best Picture and Best Writing, Adaptation. It was number 32 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    "The Thin Man" is a smart, sophisticated, urban whodunit staged with Spartan style and little nonsense by W.S. Van Dyke who went on to helm the first three entries in the six film franchise. This was not the first time that mustached William Powell either played a detective or paired up with Myrna Loy. They co-starred in several movies before and after "The Thin Man" series, such "Manhattan Melodrama," "The Great Ziegfeld," "Libeled Lady," "Double Wedding," "Love Crazy," "I Love You Again," and "Evelyn Prentice." This clever mystery thriller unfolds in three-acts. The suspects and the situation are laid out in crisp, expository fashion, and then we meet Nick & Nora Charles who become involved in the mystery. It seems our hero knew one of the suspects. This association draws him into the investigation. All this is capped off with a huge party that Nick throws for the suspects to smoke out the murderer. A variety of characters make up the cast. Remember, M-G-M produced this mystery back in 1934, when Hollywood couldn't depict violence with any realistic detail. As it is, "The Thin Man" looks like a drinking man's champ. Our hero guzzles and so do many others. Nick has guzzled six martinis by the time his wife joins him in the bar. This 91-minute melodrama qualifies as a Christmas movie because it occurs during the holiday season. The dialogue is often snappy, especially the being "shot five times in the tabloids." The secretary of an eccentric scientist, Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead of "The King Murder"), has been murdered. The eccentric scientist, Gilbert Wynant (William Henry of "Rubber Racketeers"), vanishes afterward without a trace. Earlier, Wynant's wife Mimi (Minna Gombell of "High Sierra") divorced him because of a fling with Ms. Wolf. Worst, the conniving secretary was up to no good under Wynant's very nose. Quietly enough, Julia had been embezzling money; she cashed in two bonds amounting to $50-thousand. Wynant catches her with a gangster, Morelli (Edward Brophy), and they quarrel about the kind of men that she ahs been seeing. Gilbert Wynant is the jealous type. Myrna Loy's entrance in the action is funny. Asta literally drags her with packages piled up in her arms. Later, Wynant's attorney Herbert MacCaulay (Porter Hall of "His Girl Friday"), inquires if Nick is sleuthing for Wynant's ex-wife. Nick informs MacCaulay he gave up being a private eye four years ago. "My wife's father died and left her a narrow gauge railway, and a lumber mill, and several other things. I'm taking care of them." When they have this conversation, Wynant has been missing for three months. The first entry in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's "Thin Man" franchise, "The Thin Man," takes about twenty minutes before Nick Charles (William Powell) makes his entrance. He is teaching bartenders how to mix various alcoholic beverages. "You see, the important thing is the rhythm. You should always have rhythm in your shaking. "A Manhattan you shake to a fox trot. A Bronx to a two-step time. A dry martini you always shake to waltzes." When he completes this elaboration lecture, Nick takes the drink that he prepared so fastidiously and sips it. Wynant's daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan of "Tarzan of the Apes") walks up to him and informs him that she remembers him from a case. Dorothy is searching for her father. Mimi goes to see Julia Wolf about getting more money. Morelli (Edward Brophy of "All Through the Night") learns about Julia's murder and barges into Nick's apartment. Morelli tries to kill Nick, and the authorities are suspicious about our hero. The police confiscate an unregistered gun and promise to ask him more questions. Nick Charles hasn't worked on a case as a private eye for four years. Since he has married Mrs. Charles, he handles his wife's considerable affairs. Eventually, Inspector John Guild (Nat Pendleton of "Trapped by Television") convinces Nick to work with them. Nora persuades Nick to take the case after the fugitive, Gilbert Wynant sends him a request to investigate the case. Reluctantly, Nick takes Asta and goes prowling in the dark. He uncovers an unidentified body in Wynant's laboratory. Meantime, the police and the press believe that Wynant has killed three people. The use of modern technology at the time helps Nick to find the answer that he is looking for but nobody else knows. Nick and Nora are a couple to watch.

    "The Thin Man" (1934) is one of the best films ever made....a great stage play made into a great movie. It was originally a stage play written by Dashiell Hammett, and no doubt retained most of Hammett's great writing when Albert Hackett and his then young wife, Frances Goodrich turned the play into a movie script. This was the first important movie where the lead romantic couple exchange in banter and "repartee" which reflected the acceptance (finally) in the 1930's the "the independent woman" (even married independent women!) in USA culture, less than two decades after women finally "got the vote." Major players and minor supporting actors in "The Thin Man" (1934) are all lovable, and that includes the villain, lawyer Herbert MacCauley, marvelously portrayed by long time movie character actor of note, Porter Hall. The story is a "Whodunit" and the audience never guesses the real culprit until the penultimate scene (the next to the last scene) when hero detective, Nick Charles (played to perfection by William Powell), hosts a grand dinner for half a dozen likely suspects (and police in attendance, too, both as tuxedo clad guests and also as waiter staffers!), and fingers the guilty guy. Many people opine that the best final scene in any movie is the one in Casablanca (1943) where Humphrey Bogart (playing "Rick Blaine") tells Claude Rains (playing the French "Prefect Of Police" who just helped Bogart and now becomes a fugitive along with Bogart) tells his new friend, and fellow accomplice, "Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship." But I think "The Thin Man" (1934) has the best final scene of all. It's a rapid fire "end of the film" portrait of the Nick and Nora Charles married couple about to get to bed in a moving railroad train private room, this in a movie which shows the two alone together in bedrooms before with nothing sexy at all happening between them. The audience sees unexpected beginnings of "married love," and the camera switches instantly to the nighttime train entering a tunnel with the "San Francisco, Here I Come" tune played brightly and zestfully. Alfred Hitchcock used the same "affectionate couple (Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint) about to get into bed together on a train, then quick switch to train entering a tunnel" at the end of "North By Northwest" (1959), but that movie ending didn't have "San Francisco, Here I Come" music along with it, and that makes all the difference! ---------------------- Written by David R.

    There wasn't any film noir at the time. There were a few early notions formed in Weimar Germany about dazed minds succumbing to control of storymakers. The femme fatale was beginning to get shape as a force in the story. And then there was the detective film; each studio run its own highly successful series, each one influenced by the one before. Fox had Charlie Chan, and less famously Peter Lorre's Mr. Moto. Monogram responded with the Chinese Mr. Wong. RKO had Withers. Warners run the Perry Mason cycle. These were more or less debonair sleuths, gentle, delicate beings, after the stereotypical notion for Sherlock Holmes. And of course The Thin Man, I believe six films in total pairing William Powell with Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, dilettantes and sleuths, also openly quoting Holmes. The game here is that the detective plot is incidental to the story and only the hook that lets all the other effects sink in. The screwball comedy, the sexual innuendo, the fashions, the wit as dry as the martinis. You may piece something together but quite apart from what sleuthing is going on; no one is really sure if the sleuth is on the case or not, including him, the clues and suspects are laid out on his living-room in the middle of a party and they're merely a lot of noise that gets in the way of sipping one martini after another. Our introduction to Nick is where he's showing waiters how to shake cocktails, foreshadowing handling of the case to us. Naturally he pieces everything together in the final explanatory denouement; a dinner party with all the suspects invited, one of them the killer. No device is more contrived these days, in part because it used to work so well. You didn't have to puzzle about any of this, or fates in control of the thing, because there were none. All you had to do was kick back and sip at all the extraordinary chintz of the sleuthing. This type of film culminates in the Maltese Falcon, incidentally also adapted from Hammett and the shift towards noir proper. The more elaborate trick there was that all the suspects were aware of a ridiculous detective film going on, and constantly switched between elated viewers and mischievous storymakers. Sam Spade's main assets were great acting and making up stories. The only mischief going on here is between Nick and Nora, who constantly wink at each other about sex they're not having - until the end. Their chemistry sizzles in a way that deep love does.

    The Thin Man (1934) was directed by W.S. Van Dyke. This picture has an extremely high IMDb weighted average of 8.1. I had great hopes for this film, which we saw at a New Year's eve showing at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman House in Rochester. I'm sorry to report that the film didn't work for me at any level. William Powell and Myrna Loy play Nick and Nora Charles. He's a former detective, she's an heiress. They are rich, glamorous, and very, very sophisticated. Powell and Loy were wildly popular in these roles, and reprised them again and again. Powell more or less looks the part, but I think Loy was miscast. She looks and acts like one of the bright, snappy, working-class women in a screwball comedy. She doesn't look or act like an heiress. A second problem I had with the film was the unending focus on alcohol consumption. Getting and being drunk was far more acceptable in society then than it is now. Even so, the film really wasn't about mystery or romance--it was about drinking. People are endlessly talking about drinking, or they're drinking, or they're holding icepacks to their heads on the morning after. Powell acts half-drunk for most of the film. (For the rest of the film he acts drunk.) I just don't find that entertaining. For me, the highlight of the evening happened before the film. The Eastman House volunteer who presented the film came dressed in a long, slinky, 1930's-style gown. She gave a witty, intelligent talk. This woman had the physical and mental attributes that would have made her a perfect Nora Charles. It's too bad that her role ended when the lights in the theater dimmed. P.S. I rarely post negative reviews of films that other IMDb reviewers have liked. That's not because I'm timid, but rather because if others liked them, I usually like them too. However, on the rare occasion when I've criticized a popular film, I've been sent some abusive personal comments. If you disagree with me, I'm happy to have you tell me so. Maybe I'll learn why other people think this film is so good. However, please don't use the opportunity to comment on my parentage, my species, or the depth of my mental inadequacies. Thanks, Red-125

    The Thin Man is directed by W.S Van Dyke,produced by Hunt Stromberg,with a screenplay written by Albert Hackett(based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett)and stars William Powell,Myrna Loy,Maureen O'Sullivan and Cesar Romero. Powell and Loy's chemistry in the film Manhattan Melodrama(1934)was so impressive that Van Dyke made sure they starred in his next film The Thin Man.It is in the Thin Man that they really shine together,both perfectly in tune with one another creating one of the most memorable screen marriages ever seen.In their hands Nick and Nora become a unique couple who not only love each other,they like each other and treat each other as complete equals. Former Private Detective Nick Charles(William Powell)returns home to New York with his new wife Nora(Myrna Loy)and the couples adorable dog Asta.Nick's approached by an old friend Dorothy Wynant(Maureen O'Sullivan)who's father Clyde(Edward Ellis)is the prime suspect in the murder of her Dorothy's stepmother.She doesn't believe the charge for a second,not just for personal intuition but for the fact her father has been missing for a while.She asks Nick to look for him and he eventually agrees to take on the case.Aided by Nora Nick sinks his teeth into the mystery of the Thin Man and at an unforgettable dinner party reveals both who the real murderer is and the fate of the missing man. One of the most discussed aspects of this film is Nick and Nora's constant drinking.Powell's laconic Nick may at times seem like an alcoholic but he is never out of control and slips back and forth between giddy charmer and active,sober sleuth with such ease your never quite sure if his drinking is all an act.In Loy's case she makes Nora's drinking seem both sophisticated and simply a natural extension of this elegant young woman's personality. The amount of booze consumed in the film truly reaches almost farcical levels at times(perhaps a nod to the Great Depression,now it's over lets live the good life).Despite that it somehow fits as an almost necessary element to the story(it's presence adds greatly to the films comedy). It's pointless watching this for the story,it's convoluted and quite frankly distracts from the relationship between Nick and Nora.It is they and not the plot,who are the films strongest point.The snappy banter between the two is expertly written,with lines often not striking the audience as funny until several seconds after they are spoken.The deep affection Nick has for Nora often doesn't require words, it's present simply in the looks the couple share,and she in turn adores him and wants to share in his work,even when danger threatens. Powell and Loy starred in several sequels and The Thin Man was obviously the inspiration for TV series such as Hart To Hart.Witty,exciting and complex you should seek out the Thin Man as soon as possible,you won't be disappointed.

    THE THIN MAN (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1934), directed by W.S. Van Dyke, from the novel by Dashiell Hammett, is a classic mystery-comedy that helped establish the careers of both its leading performers, William Powell and Myrna Loy, Powell especially, in a performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination. There have been mystery-comedies prior to this, A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT (Allied, 1933) with Ginger Rogers and Lyle Talbot as rival news reporters that immediately comes to mind, but THE THIN MAN stands in a class by itself. With the plot set in New York City at the start of the Christmas season, the ten minute prologue begins with Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), an absent-minded inventor, who discovers that his secretary, Julia Wolfe (Natalie Moorehead), with whom he has been carrying on a romancer, has stolen $50,000 worth of government bonds he's been saving for the upcoming wedding of his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan) to Andrew (Henry Wadsworth). Wynant confronts Julia with his accusations, and after learning the truth, he angrily walks out of the apartment down the dark streets alone. The story gets underway as Wynant's ex-wife, Mimi (Minna Gombell), in desperate need of money, comes to visit Julia to learn of Wynant's whereabouts. After entering the apartment, she finds her dead. Before the police are called, Mimi takes something from Julia's hand belonging to Wynant, and withholds the item as possible evidence. As for Dorothy, she suspects something terribly wrong when her father, away on a secret trip unknown even to his personal attorney, Herbert McCauley (Porter Hall), hasn't returned in time for the wedding. She soon takes her worries to Nick Charles (William Powell), a friend of the family having a time of his life drinking cocktails in a speakeasy. Nick, a former detective visiting from San Francisco with his wealthy wife, Nora (Myrna Loy), is asked to investigate. At first Nick declines, but after three additional murders take place, linking it all to gray-haired thin man, Wynant, now missing for three months, Nick, at Nora's urging, comes out of his four years of carefree living to look into the case. Along with Lieutenant John Guild (Nat Pendleton) and his dog, Asta, Nick stumbles upon some clues while investigating in Wynant's workshop, to surprising and unexpected results. Suspects in question include William Henry as Wynant's studious intellectual son, Gilbert; Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgensen, a lazy loafer living off Mimi; and Julia's gangster acquaintances played by Edward Brophy (Joe Morelli); and Harold Huber (Nunheimer), the latter being murder victim number three. Then there's Bert Roach being the overgrown crybaby guest at the Christmas Eve party wanting to use Nick's phone to call his "maw" long distance. The success or failure for any motion picture relies simply on fine scripting (Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich) and perfect casting. THE THIN MAN succeeds on those counts and chemistry by Powell and Loy. Having already some detective experience to his name, that of Philo Vance on three separate occasions, "The Canary Murder Case" 1929); "The Benson Murder Case" (1930 and "The Kennel Murder Case" (1933), Powell's Nick Charles, unlike any other detective commonly found in motion picture mysteries, is very much witty, down to earth, and of course, married. Rather than typically presenting a detective sleuthing with a male counterpart as comedy relief, a gal reporter, or very much alone, Nick Charles is assisted by Asta, his wire-haired fox terrier. Observant and clever with his deductions, Nick Charles is also quick with his responses, a fondness for liquor and fun at parties. His friends are usually ex-cons whom he's "sent up the river,"holding no grudge against him. Myrna Loy has found her true character in Nora Charles. Breaking away from the stereotype bossy spouse, she accepts her husband for what and whom he is, and equals with his enjoyment of fun and mystery combined. Great scene captures her sitting on the couch gowned in fur coat calmly watching her husband being a little boy at heart playing with the sling shot he's gotten for Christmas, shooting away the ornaments hanging on the Christmas tree one by one. As much as Nora would prefer sleuthing with him during his investigations, she seldom gets that chance. The climatic finish where Nick summons all connected with the case at the dinner gathering is well constructed in both humor and suspense. The success of THE THIN MAN not only brought forth many imitations, but five additional sequels starring Powell and Loy, along with the basis of a 1957-59 television series starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk, but nothing to compare with the 1934 original, being the most famous and revived of all the "Thin Man" presentations combined. Distributed to video cassette as early as the 1980s by MGM Home Video enclosed in plastic clam shells, cable television presentations on the Disney Channel's "Best of Hollywood" in the 1990s, Turner Classic Movies from 1994 onward, and finally DVD where this and others continue to acquire both a new audience along with those who know who the killer is but to just simply want to watch over and over again in the manner of Nick and Nora Charles, just for the fun of it.

    The Thin Man is directed by W. S. Van Dyke and co-written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. It is based on the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name. Starring are William Powell and Myrna Loy, with support coming from Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Porter Hall and Skippy as Astra the dog. William Axt scores the music and James Wong Howe is the cinematographer. Plot finds Powell and Loy as married couple, Nick and Nora Charles, he is a retired detective, she a good time heiress. Planning to finally settle down, their life is upturned when Nick is called back into detective work due to a friend's disappearance and the possibility he was also involved in a murder. Murder, malarkey and mirth are about to become the order of the day. It was the big surprise hit of 1934. Afforded only a tiny budget because studio head honcho Louis B. Mayer thought it was dud material, and ordered to be completed in under three weeks time, film made stars out of Powell and Loy and coined an impressive $2 million at the box office. Also birthing a franchise (5 film sequels and a radio and television series would follow), it's a film that has irresistible charm leaping out from every frame. It's easy to see even now why a mid 1930's audience could take so warmly to such an appealing motion picture. From the off the film was in good hands, Dyke (One-Take Woody as he was sometimes known) was an unfussy director with a keen eye for pacing and casting, both of which are things that shine through in this production. There's also considerable talent in the writing, both in the source material and with the script writers. Hammett based his witty bantering couple on himself and his relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman, this was ideal material for Hackett and Goodrich, themselves a happily married couple fondly thought of in the cut and thrust world of Hollywood. As a couple they would go on to write It's a Wonderful Life for Frank Capra and win the Pulitzer Prize for their play The Diary of Anne Frank. It stands out as a film of note because it successfully marries a murder mystery story with a screwball comedy spin, this was something new and exciting. While the believable relationship between Powell and Loy was also a breath of fresh air; a married couple deeply in love, devoted, funny, boozey and bouncing off of each other with witty repartee. It can never be overstated just how good Powell and Loy are here, true enough they are given an absolutely zinging script to work from, but the level of comedy, both in visual ticks and delivery of lines, is extraordinarily high. Small budget and a small shoot, but everything else about The Thin Man is big. Big laughs, big mystery and big love, all bundled up into a joyous bit of classic cinema. 9/10

    I saw this after I had seen some of the sequels and was a bit surprised at the very dark storyline surrounding the more light material involved with solving the mystery. In the first scene we see The Thin Man who is a scientist involved in some highly suspect work that eventually gets him killed. We see that he is not a very sympathetic individual, but he does have a soft side when it comes to his daughter. There is some evidence that he is also capable of slapping women around, as indicated in a later scene with his mistress. The first half hour's darkness works surprisingly well with the more lighter material. The sequels were more interested in the shenanigans of Nick and Nora, but here they seem more involved with the sad characters and Nick's one-liners are not as pronounced as the would be in the sequels. Nick and Nora are actually more supporting characters and that may be a bit disappointing. Furtunately, there are many comic highlights involving the geeky son, the inept police and the shrill ex-wife of the scientist. The motive of the murderer is a bit underdeveloped and the ending is a bit of a letdown. It is always the least likely suspect but watch closely and you can actually figure it out pretty quickly. The movie's pace is also a bit slower than its sequels' but that is because of the relatively new adjustment to sound and not a fault of the actors. There is almost no underscoring and that gives it a sort of creepy vibe in the dramatic scenes. Good first movie but the two first sequels were a bit more funny.

    This is the start of an excellent series of Thin Man movies with William Powell and Myrna Loy as the high class couple Nick and Nora Charles, with their dog Asta. Nick is a "retired" cop who has married the rich socialite Nora. Nick is always getting involved in cases the cops can't seem to solve and of course he does solve them. Usually using his old contacts with his old underworld buddies that he had given breaks to over the years. The repartee between the couple is pretty funny at times and Asta is a well trained dog who comes across as cowardly. Both of the Charles's like to drink and party some, my kind of people!! Most of action is fairly low keyed and I think is done to make the audience think.

    This film was based on one book, and because it was so popular it was turned into a six film series, with the lead stars returning for all of them, and this the first film is the one that appeared in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was most interested to watch it. Basically retired detective Nick Charles (Oscar nominated William Powell) and his wife Nora (Myrna Loy) are trying to settle down, but a friend of his, Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), the "thin man" of the title, disappears and may be involved in a murder, so he is pulled back into action to investigate. The man who has vanished is the prime suspect to the murder of his former secretary and girlfriend Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead) as all the evidence points to him, but the one who doesn't believe he has any involvement is his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan), and is the one who convinces the former private eye to take the case. This amuses his wife, but Nick does stumble onto some clues and pieces together the facts for an intense investigation, and he eventually comes to conclude who the murderer really is, but he is not telling anybody his findings until an event he is putting on. All the guests he is inviting are the ones he believes are capable of murder, but he knows only one really did the crime, and a classic dinner party scene, and with explanations of each person's involvement in the recent events, including the skeleton body of missing Mynant found who was killed for his money. Also starring Nat Pendleton as Inspector John Guild , Minna Gombell as Mimi Wynant, Porter Hall as Herbert MacCaulay, Henry Wadsworth as Tommy, William Henry as Gilbert Wynant, Harold Huber as Arthur Nunheim, Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgenson, Edward Brophy as Joe Morelli and Cyril Thornton as Tanner. Powell gives a leading performance with his clever theorising and charming wit, Loy is really likable as his wife who is by his side throughout, together they make a great duo, so it is no wonder that sequels followed, if you like mystery mixed with some good laughs then this good entertainment, a fun classic detective comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for W.S. Van Dyke, Best Picture and Best Writing, Adaptation. It was number 32 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    "The Thin Man" is a smart, sophisticated, urban whodunit staged with Spartan style and little nonsense by W.S. Van Dyke who went on to helm the first three entries in the six film franchise. This was not the first time that mustached William Powell either played a detective or paired up with Myrna Loy. They co-starred in several movies before and after "The Thin Man" series, such "Manhattan Melodrama," "The Great Ziegfeld," "Libeled Lady," "Double Wedding," "Love Crazy," "I Love You Again," and "Evelyn Prentice." This clever mystery thriller unfolds in three-acts. The suspects and the situation are laid out in crisp, expository fashion, and then we meet Nick & Nora Charles who become involved in the mystery. It seems our hero knew one of the suspects. This association draws him into the investigation. All this is capped off with a huge party that Nick throws for the suspects to smoke out the murderer. A variety of characters make up the cast. Remember, M-G-M produced this mystery back in 1934, when Hollywood couldn't depict violence with any realistic detail. As it is, "The Thin Man" looks like a drinking man's champ. Our hero guzzles and so do many others. Nick has guzzled six martinis by the time his wife joins him in the bar. This 91-minute melodrama qualifies as a Christmas movie because it occurs during the holiday season. The dialogue is often snappy, especially the being "shot five times in the tabloids." The secretary of an eccentric scientist, Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead of "The King Murder"), has been murdered. The eccentric scientist, Gilbert Wynant (William Henry of "Rubber Racketeers"), vanishes afterward without a trace. Earlier, Wynant's wife Mimi (Minna Gombell of "High Sierra") divorced him because of a fling with Ms. Wolf. Worst, the conniving secretary was up to no good under Wynant's very nose. Quietly enough, Julia had been embezzling money; she cashed in two bonds amounting to $50-thousand. Wynant catches her with a gangster, Morelli (Edward Brophy), and they quarrel about the kind of men that she ahs been seeing. Gilbert Wynant is the jealous type. Myrna Loy's entrance in the action is funny. Asta literally drags her with packages piled up in her arms. Later, Wynant's attorney Herbert MacCaulay (Porter Hall of "His Girl Friday"), inquires if Nick is sleuthing for Wynant's ex-wife. Nick informs MacCaulay he gave up being a private eye four years ago. "My wife's father died and left her a narrow gauge railway, and a lumber mill, and several other things. I'm taking care of them." When they have this conversation, Wynant has been missing for three months. The first entry in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's "Thin Man" franchise, "The Thin Man," takes about twenty minutes before Nick Charles (William Powell) makes his entrance. He is teaching bartenders how to mix various alcoholic beverages. "You see, the important thing is the rhythm. You should always have rhythm in your shaking. "A Manhattan you shake to a fox trot. A Bronx to a two-step time. A dry martini you always shake to waltzes." When he completes this elaboration lecture, Nick takes the drink that he prepared so fastidiously and sips it. Wynant's daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan of "Tarzan of the Apes") walks up to him and informs him that she remembers him from a case. Dorothy is searching for her father. Mimi goes to see Julia Wolf about getting more money. Morelli (Edward Brophy of "All Through the Night") learns about Julia's murder and barges into Nick's apartment. Morelli tries to kill Nick, and the authorities are suspicious about our hero. The police confiscate an unregistered gun and promise to ask him more questions. Nick Charles hasn't worked on a case as a private eye for four years. Since he has married Mrs. Charles, he handles his wife's considerable affairs. Eventually, Inspector John Guild (Nat Pendleton of "Trapped by Television") convinces Nick to work with them. Nora persuades Nick to take the case after the fugitive, Gilbert Wynant sends him a request to investigate the case. Reluctantly, Nick takes Asta and goes prowling in the dark. He uncovers an unidentified body in Wynant's laboratory. Meantime, the police and the press believe that Wynant has killed three people. The use of modern technology at the time helps Nick to find the answer that he is looking for but nobody else knows. Nick and Nora are a couple to watch.

    "The Thin Man" (1934) is one of the best films ever made....a great stage play made into a great movie. It was originally a stage play written by Dashiell Hammett, and no doubt retained most of Hammett's great writing when Albert Hackett and his then young wife, Frances Goodrich turned the play into a movie script. This was the first important movie where the lead romantic couple exchange in banter and "repartee" which reflected the acceptance (finally) in the 1930's the "the independent woman" (even married independent women!) in USA culture, less than two decades after women finally "got the vote." Major players and minor supporting actors in "The Thin Man" (1934) are all lovable, and that includes the villain, lawyer Herbert MacCauley, marvelously portrayed by long time movie character actor of note, Porter Hall. The story is a "Whodunit" and the audience never guesses the real culprit until the penultimate scene (the next to the last scene) when hero detective, Nick Charles (played to perfection by William Powell), hosts a grand dinner for half a dozen likely suspects (and police in attendance, too, both as tuxedo clad guests and also as waiter staffers!), and fingers the guilty guy. Many people opine that the best final scene in any movie is the one in Casablanca (1943) where Humphrey Bogart (playing "Rick Blaine") tells Claude Rains (playing the French "Prefect Of Police" who just helped Bogart and now becomes a fugitive along with Bogart) tells his new friend, and fellow accomplice, "Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship." But I think "The Thin Man" (1934) has the best final scene of all. It's a rapid fire "end of the film" portrait of the Nick and Nora Charles married couple about to get to bed in a moving railroad train private room, this in a movie which shows the two alone together in bedrooms before with nothing sexy at all happening between them. The audience sees unexpected beginnings of "married love," and the camera switches instantly to the nighttime train entering a tunnel with the "San Francisco, Here I Come" tune played brightly and zestfully. Alfred Hitchcock used the same "affectionate couple (Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint) about to get into bed together on a train, then quick switch to train entering a tunnel" at the end of "North By Northwest" (1959), but that movie ending didn't have "San Francisco, Here I Come" music along with it, and that makes all the difference! ---------------------- Written by David R.

    There wasn't any film noir at the time. There were a few early notions formed in Weimar Germany about dazed minds succumbing to control of storymakers. The femme fatale was beginning to get shape as a force in the story. And then there was the detective film; each studio run its own highly successful series, each one influenced by the one before. Fox had Charlie Chan, and less famously Peter Lorre's Mr. Moto. Monogram responded with the Chinese Mr. Wong. RKO had Withers. Warners run the Perry Mason cycle. These were more or less debonair sleuths, gentle, delicate beings, after the stereotypical notion for Sherlock Holmes. And of course The Thin Man, I believe six films in total pairing William Powell with Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, dilettantes and sleuths, also openly quoting Holmes. The game here is that the detective plot is incidental to the story and only the hook that lets all the other effects sink in. The screwball comedy, the sexual innuendo, the fashions, the wit as dry as the martinis. You may piece something together but quite apart from what sleuthing is going on; no one is really sure if the sleuth is on the case or not, including him, the clues and suspects are laid out on his living-room in the middle of a party and they're merely a lot of noise that gets in the way of sipping one martini after another. Our introduction to Nick is where he's showing waiters how to shake cocktails, foreshadowing handling of the case to us. Naturally he pieces everything together in the final explanatory denouement; a dinner party with all the suspects invited, one of them the killer. No device is more contrived these days, in part because it used to work so well. You didn't have to puzzle about any of this, or fates in control of the thing, because there were none. All you had to do was kick back and sip at all the extraordinary chintz of the sleuthing. This type of film culminates in the Maltese Falcon, incidentally also adapted from Hammett and the shift towards noir proper. The more elaborate trick there was that all the suspects were aware of a ridiculous detective film going on, and constantly switched between elated viewers and mischievous storymakers. Sam Spade's main assets were great acting and making up stories. The only mischief going on here is between Nick and Nora, who constantly wink at each other about sex they're not having - until the end. Their chemistry sizzles in a way that deep love does.

    The Thin Man (1934) was directed by W.S. Van Dyke. This picture has an extremely high IMDb weighted average of 8.1. I had great hopes for this film, which we saw at a New Year's eve showing at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman House in Rochester. I'm sorry to report that the film didn't work for me at any level. William Powell and Myrna Loy play Nick and Nora Charles. He's a former detective, she's an heiress. They are rich, glamorous, and very, very sophisticated. Powell and Loy were wildly popular in these roles, and reprised them again and again. Powell more or less looks the part, but I think Loy was miscast. She looks and acts like one of the bright, snappy, working-class women in a screwball comedy. She doesn't look or act like an heiress. A second problem I had with the film was the unending focus on alcohol consumption. Getting and being drunk was far more acceptable in society then than it is now. Even so, the film really wasn't about mystery or romance--it was about drinking. People are endlessly talking about drinking, or they're drinking, or they're holding icepacks to their heads on the morning after. Powell acts half-drunk for most of the film. (For the rest of the film he acts drunk.) I just don't find that entertaining. For me, the highlight of the evening happened before the film. The Eastman House volunteer who presented the film came dressed in a long, slinky, 1930's-style gown. She gave a witty, intelligent talk. This woman had the physical and mental attributes that would have made her a perfect Nora Charles. It's too bad that her role ended when the lights in the theater dimmed. P.S. I rarely post negative reviews of films that other IMDb reviewers have liked. That's not because I'm timid, but rather because if others liked them, I usually like them too. However, on the rare occasion when I've criticized a popular film, I've been sent some abusive personal comments. If you disagree with me, I'm happy to have you tell me so. Maybe I'll learn why other people think this film is so good. However, please don't use the opportunity to comment on my parentage, my species, or the depth of my mental inadequacies. Thanks, Red-125

    The Thin Man is directed by W.S Van Dyke,produced by Hunt Stromberg,with a screenplay written by Albert Hackett(based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett)and stars William Powell,Myrna Loy,Maureen O'Sullivan and Cesar Romero. Powell and Loy's chemistry in the film Manhattan Melodrama(1934)was so impressive that Van Dyke made sure they starred in his next film The Thin Man.It is in the Thin Man that they really shine together,both perfectly in tune with one another creating one of the most memorable screen marriages ever seen.In their hands Nick and Nora become a unique couple who not only love each other,they like each other and treat each other as complete equals. Former Private Detective Nick Charles(William Powell)returns home to New York with his new wife Nora(Myrna Loy)and the couples adorable dog Asta.Nick's approached by an old friend Dorothy Wynant(Maureen O'Sullivan)who's father Clyde(Edward Ellis)is the prime suspect in the murder of her Dorothy's stepmother.She doesn't believe the charge for a second,not just for personal intuition but for the fact her father has been missing for a while.She asks Nick to look for him and he eventually agrees to take on the case.Aided by Nora Nick sinks his teeth into the mystery of the Thin Man and at an unforgettable dinner party reveals both who the real murderer is and the fate of the missing man. One of the most discussed aspects of this film is Nick and Nora's constant drinking.Powell's laconic Nick may at times seem like an alcoholic but he is never out of control and slips back and forth between giddy charmer and active,sober sleuth with such ease your never quite sure if his drinking is all an act.In Loy's case she makes Nora's drinking seem both sophisticated and simply a natural extension of this elegant young woman's personality. The amount of booze consumed in the film truly reaches almost farcical levels at times(perhaps a nod to the Great Depression,now it's over lets live the good life).Despite that it somehow fits as an almost necessary element to the story(it's presence adds greatly to the films comedy). It's pointless watching this for the story,it's convoluted and quite frankly distracts from the relationship between Nick and Nora.It is they and not the plot,who are the films strongest point.The snappy banter between the two is expertly written,with lines often not striking the audience as funny until several seconds after they are spoken.The deep affection Nick has for Nora often doesn't require words, it's present simply in the looks the couple share,and she in turn adores him and wants to share in his work,even when danger threatens. Powell and Loy starred in several sequels and The Thin Man was obviously the inspiration for TV series such as Hart To Hart.Witty,exciting and complex you should seek out the Thin Man as soon as possible,you won't be disappointed.

    THE THIN MAN (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1934), directed by W.S. Van Dyke, from the novel by Dashiell Hammett, is a classic mystery-comedy that helped establish the careers of both its leading performers, William Powell and Myrna Loy, Powell especially, in a performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination. There have been mystery-comedies prior to this, A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT (Allied, 1933) with Ginger Rogers and Lyle Talbot as rival news reporters that immediately comes to mind, but THE THIN MAN stands in a class by itself. With the plot set in New York City at the start of the Christmas season, the ten minute prologue begins with Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), an absent-minded inventor, who discovers that his secretary, Julia Wolfe (Natalie Moorehead), with whom he has been carrying on a romancer, has stolen $50,000 worth of government bonds he's been saving for the upcoming wedding of his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan) to Andrew (Henry Wadsworth). Wynant confronts Julia with his accusations, and after learning the truth, he angrily walks out of the apartment down the dark streets alone. The story gets underway as Wynant's ex-wife, Mimi (Minna Gombell), in desperate need of money, comes to visit Julia to learn of Wynant's whereabouts. After entering the apartment, she finds her dead. Before the police are called, Mimi takes something from Julia's hand belonging to Wynant, and withholds the item as possible evidence. As for Dorothy, she suspects something terribly wrong when her father, away on a secret trip unknown even to his personal attorney, Herbert McCauley (Porter Hall), hasn't returned in time for the wedding. She soon takes her worries to Nick Charles (William Powell), a friend of the family having a time of his life drinking cocktails in a speakeasy. Nick, a former detective visiting from San Francisco with his wealthy wife, Nora (Myrna Loy), is asked to investigate. At first Nick declines, but after three additional murders take place, linking it all to gray-haired thin man, Wynant, now missing for three months, Nick, at Nora's urging, comes out of his four years of carefree living to look into the case. Along with Lieutenant John Guild (Nat Pendleton) and his dog, Asta, Nick stumbles upon some clues while investigating in Wynant's workshop, to surprising and unexpected results. Suspects in question include William Henry as Wynant's studious intellectual son, Gilbert; Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgensen, a lazy loafer living off Mimi; and Julia's gangster acquaintances played by Edward Brophy (Joe Morelli); and Harold Huber (Nunheimer), the latter being murder victim number three. Then there's Bert Roach being the overgrown crybaby guest at the Christmas Eve party wanting to use Nick's phone to call his "maw" long distance. The success or failure for any motion picture relies simply on fine scripting (Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich) and perfect casting. THE THIN MAN succeeds on those counts and chemistry by Powell and Loy. Having already some detective experience to his name, that of Philo Vance on three separate occasions, "The Canary Murder Case" 1929); "The Benson Murder Case" (1930 and "The Kennel Murder Case" (1933), Powell's Nick Charles, unlike any other detective commonly found in motion picture mysteries, is very much witty, down to earth, and of course, married. Rather than typically presenting a detective sleuthing with a male counterpart as comedy relief, a gal reporter, or very much alone, Nick Charles is assisted by Asta, his wire-haired fox terrier. Observant and clever with his deductions, Nick Charles is also quick with his responses, a fondness for liquor and fun at parties. His friends are usually ex-cons whom he's "sent up the river,"holding no grudge against him. Myrna Loy has found her true character in Nora Charles. Breaking away from the stereotype bossy spouse, she accepts her husband for what and whom he is, and equals with his enjoyment of fun and mystery combined. Great scene captures her sitting on the couch gowned in fur coat calmly watching her husband being a little boy at heart playing with the sling shot he's gotten for Christmas, shooting away the ornaments hanging on the Christmas tree one by one. As much as Nora would prefer sleuthing with him during his investigations, she seldom gets that chance. The climatic finish where Nick summons all connected with the case at the dinner gathering is well constructed in both humor and suspense. The success of THE THIN MAN not only brought forth many imitations, but five additional sequels starring Powell and Loy, along with the basis of a 1957-59 television series starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk, but nothing to compare with the 1934 original, being the most famous and revived of all the "Thin Man" presentations combined. Distributed to video cassette as early as the 1980s by MGM Home Video enclosed in plastic clam shells, cable television presentations on the Disney Channel's "Best of Hollywood" in the 1990s, Turner Classic Movies from 1994 onward, and finally DVD where this and others continue to acquire both a new audience along with those who know who the killer is but to just simply want to watch over and over again in the manner of Nick and Nora Charles, just for the fun of it.

    The Thin Man is directed by W. S. Van Dyke and co-written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. It is based on the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name. Starring are William Powell and Myrna Loy, with support coming from Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Porter Hall and Skippy as Astra the dog. William Axt scores the music and James Wong Howe is the cinematographer. Plot finds Powell and Loy as married couple, Nick and Nora Charles, he is a retired detective, she a good time heiress. Planning to finally settle down, their life is upturned when Nick is called back into detective work due to a friend's disappearance and the possibility he was also involved in a murder. Murder, malarkey and mirth are about to become the order of the day. It was the big surprise hit of 1934. Afforded only a tiny budget because studio head honcho Louis B. Mayer thought it was dud material, and ordered to be completed in under three weeks time, film made stars out of Powell and Loy and coined an impressive $2 million at the box office. Also birthing a franchise (5 film sequels and a radio and television series would follow), it's a film that has irresistible charm leaping out from every frame. It's easy to see even now why a mid 1930's audience could take so warmly to such an appealing motion picture. From the off the film was in good hands, Dyke (One-Take Woody as he was sometimes known) was an unfussy director with a keen eye for pacing and casting, both of which are things that shine through in this production. There's also considerable talent in the writing, both in the source material and with the script writers. Hammett based his witty bantering couple on himself and his relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman, this was ideal material for Hackett and Goodrich, themselves a happily married couple fondly thought of in the cut and thrust world of Hollywood. As a couple they would go on to write It's a Wonderful Life for Frank Capra and win the Pulitzer Prize for their play The Diary of Anne Frank. It stands out as a film of note because it successfully marries a murder mystery story with a screwball comedy spin, this was something new and exciting. While the believable relationship between Powell and Loy was also a breath of fresh air; a married couple deeply in love, devoted, funny, boozey and bouncing off of each other with witty repartee. It can never be overstated just how good Powell and Loy are here, true enough they are given an absolutely zinging script to work from, but the level of comedy, both in visual ticks and delivery of lines, is extraordinarily high. Small budget and a small shoot, but everything else about The Thin Man is big. Big laughs, big mystery and big love, all bundled up into a joyous bit of classic cinema. 9/10

    I saw this after I had seen some of the sequels and was a bit surprised at the very dark storyline surrounding the more light material involved with solving the mystery. In the first scene we see The Thin Man who is a scientist involved in some highly suspect work that eventually gets him killed. We see that he is not a very sympathetic individual, but he does have a soft side when it comes to his daughter. There is some evidence that he is also capable of slapping women around, as indicated in a later scene with his mistress. The first half hour's darkness works surprisingly well with the more lighter material. The sequels were more interested in the shenanigans of Nick and Nora, but here they seem more involved with the sad characters and Nick's one-liners are not as pronounced as the would be in the sequels. Nick and Nora are actually more supporting characters and that may be a bit disappointing. Furtunately, there are many comic highlights involving the geeky son, the inept police and the shrill ex-wife of the scientist. The motive of the murderer is a bit underdeveloped and the ending is a bit of a letdown. It is always the least likely suspect but watch closely and you can actually figure it out pretty quickly. The movie's pace is also a bit slower than its sequels' but that is because of the relatively new adjustment to sound and not a fault of the actors. There is almost no underscoring and that gives it a sort of creepy vibe in the dramatic scenes. Good first movie but the two first sequels were a bit more funny.

    This is the start of an excellent series of Thin Man movies with William Powell and Myrna Loy as the high class couple Nick and Nora Charles, with their dog Asta. Nick is a "retired" cop who has married the rich socialite Nora. Nick is always getting involved in cases the cops can't seem to solve and of course he does solve them. Usually using his old contacts with his old underworld buddies that he had given breaks to over the years. The repartee between the couple is pretty funny at times and Asta is a well trained dog who comes across as cowardly. Both of the Charles's like to drink and party some, my kind of people!! Most of action is fairly low keyed and I think is done to make the audience think.

    This film was based on one book, and because it was so popular it was turned into a six film series, with the lead stars returning for all of them, and this the first film is the one that appeared in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was most interested to watch it. Basically retired detective Nick Charles (Oscar nominated William Powell) and his wife Nora (Myrna Loy) are trying to settle down, but a friend of his, Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), the "thin man" of the title, disappears and may be involved in a murder, so he is pulled back into action to investigate. The man who has vanished is the prime suspect to the murder of his former secretary and girlfriend Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead) as all the evidence points to him, but the one who doesn't believe he has any involvement is his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan), and is the one who convinces the former private eye to take the case. This amuses his wife, but Nick does stumble onto some clues and pieces together the facts for an intense investigation, and he eventually comes to conclude who the murderer really is, but he is not telling anybody his findings until an event he is putting on. All the guests he is inviting are the ones he believes are capable of murder, but he knows only one really did the crime, and a classic dinner party scene, and with explanations of each person's involvement in the recent events, including the skeleton body of missing Mynant found who was killed for his money. Also starring Nat Pendleton as Inspector John Guild , Minna Gombell as Mimi Wynant, Porter Hall as Herbert MacCaulay, Henry Wadsworth as Tommy, William Henry as Gilbert Wynant, Harold Huber as Arthur Nunheim, Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgenson, Edward Brophy as Joe Morelli and Cyril Thornton as Tanner. Powell gives a leading performance with his clever theorising and charming wit, Loy is really likable as his wife who is by his side throughout, together they make a great duo, so it is no wonder that sequels followed, if you like mystery mixed with some good laughs then this good entertainment, a fun classic detective comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for W.S. Van Dyke, Best Picture and Best Writing, Adaptation. It was number 32 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    "The Thin Man" is a smart, sophisticated, urban whodunit staged with Spartan style and little nonsense by W.S. Van Dyke who went on to helm the first three entries in the six film franchise. This was not the first time that mustached William Powell either played a detective or paired up with Myrna Loy. They co-starred in several movies before and after "The Thin Man" series, such "Manhattan Melodrama," "The Great Ziegfeld," "Libeled Lady," "Double Wedding," "Love Crazy," "I Love You Again," and "Evelyn Prentice." This clever mystery thriller unfolds in three-acts. The suspects and the situation are laid out in crisp, expository fashion, and then we meet Nick & Nora Charles who become involved in the mystery. It seems our hero knew one of the suspects. This association draws him into the investigation. All this is capped off with a huge party that Nick throws for the suspects to smoke out the murderer. A variety of characters make up the cast. Remember, M-G-M produced this mystery back in 1934, when Hollywood couldn't depict violence with any realistic detail. As it is, "The Thin Man" looks like a drinking man's champ. Our hero guzzles and so do many others. Nick has guzzled six martinis by the time his wife joins him in the bar. This 91-minute melodrama qualifies as a Christmas movie because it occurs during the holiday season. The dialogue is often snappy, especially the being "shot five times in the tabloids." The secretary of an eccentric scientist, Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead of "The King Murder"), has been murdered. The eccentric scientist, Gilbert Wynant (William Henry of "Rubber Racketeers"), vanishes afterward without a trace. Earlier, Wynant's wife Mimi (Minna Gombell of "High Sierra") divorced him because of a fling with Ms. Wolf. Worst, the conniving secretary was up to no good under Wynant's very nose. Quietly enough, Julia had been embezzling money; she cashed in two bonds amounting to $50-thousand. Wynant catches her with a gangster, Morelli (Edward Brophy), and they quarrel about the kind of men that she ahs been seeing. Gilbert Wynant is the jealous type. Myrna Loy's entrance in the action is funny. Asta literally drags her with packages piled up in her arms. Later, Wynant's attorney Herbert MacCaulay (Porter Hall of "His Girl Friday"), inquires if Nick is sleuthing for Wynant's ex-wife. Nick informs MacCaulay he gave up being a private eye four years ago. "My wife's father died and left her a narrow gauge railway, and a lumber mill, and several other things. I'm taking care of them." When they have this conversation, Wynant has been missing for three months. The first entry in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's "Thin Man" franchise, "The Thin Man," takes about twenty minutes before Nick Charles (William Powell) makes his entrance. He is teaching bartenders how to mix various alcoholic beverages. "You see, the important thing is the rhythm. You should always have rhythm in your shaking. "A Manhattan you shake to a fox trot. A Bronx to a two-step time. A dry martini you always shake to waltzes." When he completes this elaboration lecture, Nick takes the drink that he prepared so fastidiously and sips it. Wynant's daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan of "Tarzan of the Apes") walks up to him and informs him that she remembers him from a case. Dorothy is searching for her father. Mimi goes to see Julia Wolf about getting more money. Morelli (Edward Brophy of "All Through the Night") learns about Julia's murder and barges into Nick's apartment. Morelli tries to kill Nick, and the authorities are suspicious about our hero. The police confiscate an unregistered gun and promise to ask him more questions. Nick Charles hasn't worked on a case as a private eye for four years. Since he has married Mrs. Charles, he handles his wife's considerable affairs. Eventually, Inspector John Guild (Nat Pendleton of "Trapped by Television") convinces Nick to work with them. Nora persuades Nick to take the case after the fugitive, Gilbert Wynant sends him a request to investigate the case. Reluctantly, Nick takes Asta and goes prowling in the dark. He uncovers an unidentified body in Wynant's laboratory. Meantime, the police and the press believe that Wynant has killed three people. The use of modern technology at the time helps Nick to find the answer that he is looking for but nobody else knows. Nick and Nora are a couple to watch.

    "The Thin Man" (1934) is one of the best films ever made....a great stage play made into a great movie. It was originally a stage play written by Dashiell Hammett, and no doubt retained most of Hammett's great writing when Albert Hackett and his then young wife, Frances Goodrich turned the play into a movie script. This was the first important movie where the lead romantic couple exchange in banter and "repartee" which reflected the acceptance (finally) in the 1930's the "the independent woman" (even married independent women!) in USA culture, less than two decades after women finally "got the vote." Major players and minor supporting actors in "The Thin Man" (1934) are all lovable, and that includes the villain, lawyer Herbert MacCauley, marvelously portrayed by long time movie character actor of note, Porter Hall. The story is a "Whodunit" and the audience never guesses the real culprit until the penultimate scene (the next to the last scene) when hero detective, Nick Charles (played to perfection by William Powell), hosts a grand dinner for half a dozen likely suspects (and police in attendance, too, both as tuxedo clad guests and also as waiter staffers!), and fingers the guilty guy. Many people opine that the best final scene in any movie is the one in Casablanca (1943) where Humphrey Bogart (playing "Rick Blaine") tells Claude Rains (playing the French "Prefect Of Police" who just helped Bogart and now becomes a fugitive along with Bogart) tells his new friend, and fellow accomplice, "Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship." But I think "The Thin Man" (1934) has the best final scene of all. It's a rapid fire "end of the film" portrait of the Nick and Nora Charles married couple about to get to bed in a moving railroad train private room, this in a movie which shows the two alone together in bedrooms before with nothing sexy at all happening between them. The audience sees unexpected beginnings of "married love," and the camera switches instantly to the nighttime train entering a tunnel with the "San Francisco, Here I Come" tune played brightly and zestfully. Alfred Hitchcock used the same "affectionate couple (Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint) about to get into bed together on a train, then quick switch to train entering a tunnel" at the end of "North By Northwest" (1959), but that movie ending didn't have "San Francisco, Here I Come" music along with it, and that makes all the difference! ---------------------- Written by David R.

    There wasn't any film noir at the time. There were a few early notions formed in Weimar Germany about dazed minds succumbing to control of storymakers. The femme fatale was beginning to get shape as a force in the story. And then there was the detective film; each studio run its own highly successful series, each one influenced by the one before. Fox had Charlie Chan, and less famously Peter Lorre's Mr. Moto. Monogram responded with the Chinese Mr. Wong. RKO had Withers. Warners run the Perry Mason cycle. These were more or less debonair sleuths, gentle, delicate beings, after the stereotypical notion for Sherlock Holmes. And of course The Thin Man, I believe six films in total pairing William Powell with Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, dilettantes and sleuths, also openly quoting Holmes. The game here is that the detective plot is incidental to the story and only the hook that lets all the other effects sink in. The screwball comedy, the sexual innuendo, the fashions, the wit as dry as the martinis. You may piece something together but quite apart from what sleuthing is going on; no one is really sure if the sleuth is on the case or not, including him, the clues and suspects are laid out on his living-room in the middle of a party and they're merely a lot of noise that gets in the way of sipping one martini after another. Our introduction to Nick is where he's showing waiters how to shake cocktails, foreshadowing handling of the case to us. Naturally he pieces everything together in the final explanatory denouement; a dinner party with all the suspects invited, one of them the killer. No device is more contrived these days, in part because it used to work so well. You didn't have to puzzle about any of this, or fates in control of the thing, because there were none. All you had to do was kick back and sip at all the extraordinary chintz of the sleuthing. This type of film culminates in the Maltese Falcon, incidentally also adapted from Hammett and the shift towards noir proper. The more elaborate trick there was that all the suspects were aware of a ridiculous detective film going on, and constantly switched between elated viewers and mischievous storymakers. Sam Spade's main assets were great acting and making up stories. The only mischief going on here is between Nick and Nora, who constantly wink at each other about sex they're not having - until the end. Their chemistry sizzles in a way that deep love does.

    The Thin Man (1934) was directed by W.S. Van Dyke. This picture has an extremely high IMDb weighted average of 8.1. I had great hopes for this film, which we saw at a New Year's eve showing at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman House in Rochester. I'm sorry to report that the film didn't work for me at any level. William Powell and Myrna Loy play Nick and Nora Charles. He's a former detective, she's an heiress. They are rich, glamorous, and very, very sophisticated. Powell and Loy were wildly popular in these roles, and reprised them again and again. Powell more or less looks the part, but I think Loy was miscast. She looks and acts like one of the bright, snappy, working-class women in a screwball comedy. She doesn't look or act like an heiress. A second problem I had with the film was the unending focus on alcohol consumption. Getting and being drunk was far more acceptable in society then than it is now. Even so, the film really wasn't about mystery or romance--it was about drinking. People are endlessly talking about drinking, or they're drinking, or they're holding icepacks to their heads on the morning after. Powell acts half-drunk for most of the film. (For the rest of the film he acts drunk.) I just don't find that entertaining. For me, the highlight of the evening happened before the film. The Eastman House volunteer who presented the film came dressed in a long, slinky, 1930's-style gown. She gave a witty, intelligent talk. This woman had the physical and mental attributes that would have made her a perfect Nora Charles. It's too bad that her role ended when the lights in the theater dimmed. P.S. I rarely post negative reviews of films that other IMDb reviewers have liked. That's not because I'm timid, but rather because if others liked them, I usually like them too. However, on the rare occasion when I've criticized a popular film, I've been sent some abusive personal comments. If you disagree with me, I'm happy to have you tell me so. Maybe I'll learn why other people think this film is so good. However, please don't use the opportunity to comment on my parentage, my species, or the depth of my mental inadequacies. Thanks, Red-125

    The Thin Man is directed by W.S Van Dyke,produced by Hunt Stromberg,with a screenplay written by Albert Hackett(based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett)and stars William Powell,Myrna Loy,Maureen O'Sullivan and Cesar Romero. Powell and Loy's chemistry in the film Manhattan Melodrama(1934)was so impressive that Van Dyke made sure they starred in his next film The Thin Man.It is in the Thin Man that they really shine together,both perfectly in tune with one another creating one of the most memorable screen marriages ever seen.In their hands Nick and Nora become a unique couple who not only love each other,they like each other and treat each other as complete equals. Former Private Detective Nick Charles(William Powell)returns home to New York with his new wife Nora(Myrna Loy)and the couples adorable dog Asta.Nick's approached by an old friend Dorothy Wynant(Maureen O'Sullivan)who's father Clyde(Edward Ellis)is the prime suspect in the murder of her Dorothy's stepmother.She doesn't believe the charge for a second,not just for personal intuition but for the fact her father has been missing for a while.She asks Nick to look for him and he eventually agrees to take on the case.Aided by Nora Nick sinks his teeth into the mystery of the Thin Man and at an unforgettable dinner party reveals both who the real murderer is and the fate of the missing man. One of the most discussed aspects of this film is Nick and Nora's constant drinking.Powell's laconic Nick may at times seem like an alcoholic but he is never out of control and slips back and forth between giddy charmer and active,sober sleuth with such ease your never quite sure if his drinking is all an act.In Loy's case she makes Nora's drinking seem both sophisticated and simply a natural extension of this elegant young woman's personality. The amount of booze consumed in the film truly reaches almost farcical levels at times(perhaps a nod to the Great Depression,now it's over lets live the good life).Despite that it somehow fits as an almost necessary element to the story(it's presence adds greatly to the films comedy). It's pointless watching this for the story,it's convoluted and quite frankly distracts from the relationship between Nick and Nora.It is they and not the plot,who are the films strongest point.The snappy banter between the two is expertly written,with lines often not striking the audience as funny until several seconds after they are spoken.The deep affection Nick has for Nora often doesn't require words, it's present simply in the looks the couple share,and she in turn adores him and wants to share in his work,even when danger threatens. Powell and Loy starred in several sequels and The Thin Man was obviously the inspiration for TV series such as Hart To Hart.Witty,exciting and complex you should seek out the Thin Man as soon as possible,you won't be disappointed.

    THE THIN MAN (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1934), directed by W.S. Van Dyke, from the novel by Dashiell Hammett, is a classic mystery-comedy that helped establish the careers of both its leading performers, William Powell and Myrna Loy, Powell especially, in a performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination. There have been mystery-comedies prior to this, A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT (Allied, 1933) with Ginger Rogers and Lyle Talbot as rival news reporters that immediately comes to mind, but THE THIN MAN stands in a class by itself. With the plot set in New York City at the start of the Christmas season, the ten minute prologue begins with Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), an absent-minded inventor, who discovers that his secretary, Julia Wolfe (Natalie Moorehead), with whom he has been carrying on a romancer, has stolen $50,000 worth of government bonds he's been saving for the upcoming wedding of his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan) to Andrew (Henry Wadsworth). Wynant confronts Julia with his accusations, and after learning the truth, he angrily walks out of the apartment down the dark streets alone. The story gets underway as Wynant's ex-wife, Mimi (Minna Gombell), in desperate need of money, comes to visit Julia to learn of Wynant's whereabouts. After entering the apartment, she finds her dead. Before the police are called, Mimi takes something from Julia's hand belonging to Wynant, and withholds the item as possible evidence. As for Dorothy, she suspects something terribly wrong when her father, away on a secret trip unknown even to his personal attorney, Herbert McCauley (Porter Hall), hasn't returned in time for the wedding. She soon takes her worries to Nick Charles (William Powell), a friend of the family having a time of his life drinking cocktails in a speakeasy. Nick, a former detective visiting from San Francisco with his wealthy wife, Nora (Myrna Loy), is asked to investigate. At first Nick declines, but after three additional murders take place, linking it all to gray-haired thin man, Wynant, now missing for three months, Nick, at Nora's urging, comes out of his four years of carefree living to look into the case. Along with Lieutenant John Guild (Nat Pendleton) and his dog, Asta, Nick stumbles upon some clues while investigating in Wynant's workshop, to surprising and unexpected results. Suspects in question include William Henry as Wynant's studious intellectual son, Gilbert; Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgensen, a lazy loafer living off Mimi; and Julia's gangster acquaintances played by Edward Brophy (Joe Morelli); and Harold Huber (Nunheimer), the latter being murder victim number three. Then there's Bert Roach being the overgrown crybaby guest at the Christmas Eve party wanting to use Nick's phone to call his "maw" long distance. The success or failure for any motion picture relies simply on fine scripting (Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich) and perfect casting. THE THIN MAN succeeds on those counts and chemistry by Powell and Loy. Having already some detective experience to his name, that of Philo Vance on three separate occasions, "The Canary Murder Case" 1929); "The Benson Murder Case" (1930 and "The Kennel Murder Case" (1933), Powell's Nick Charles, unlike any other detective commonly found in motion picture mysteries, is very much witty, down to earth, and of course, married. Rather than typically presenting a detective sleuthing with a male counterpart as comedy relief, a gal reporter, or very much alone, Nick Charles is assisted by Asta, his wire-haired fox terrier. Observant and clever with his deductions, Nick Charles is also quick with his responses, a fondness for liquor and fun at parties. His friends are usually ex-cons whom he's "sent up the river,"holding no grudge against him. Myrna Loy has found her true character in Nora Charles. Breaking away from the stereotype bossy spouse, she accepts her husband for what and whom he is, and equals with his enjoyment of fun and mystery combined. Great scene captures her sitting on the couch gowned in fur coat calmly watching her husband being a little boy at heart playing with the sling shot he's gotten for Christmas, shooting away the ornaments hanging on the Christmas tree one by one. As much as Nora would prefer sleuthing with him during his investigations, she seldom gets that chance. The climatic finish where Nick summons all connected with the case at the dinner gathering is well constructed in both humor and suspense. The success of THE THIN MAN not only brought forth many imitations, but five additional sequels starring Powell and Loy, along with the basis of a 1957-59 television series starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk, but nothing to compare with the 1934 original, being the most famous and revived of all the "Thin Man" presentations combined. Distributed to video cassette as early as the 1980s by MGM Home Video enclosed in plastic clam shells, cable television presentations on the Disney Channel's "Best of Hollywood" in the 1990s, Turner Classic Movies from 1994 onward, and finally DVD where this and others continue to acquire both a new audience along with those who know who the killer is but to just simply want to watch over and over again in the manner of Nick and Nora Charles, just for the fun of it.

    The Thin Man is directed by W. S. Van Dyke and co-written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. It is based on the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name. Starring are William Powell and Myrna Loy, with support coming from Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Porter Hall and Skippy as Astra the dog. William Axt scores the music and James Wong Howe is the cinematographer. Plot finds Powell and Loy as married couple, Nick and Nora Charles, he is a retired detective, she a good time heiress. Planning to finally settle down, their life is upturned when Nick is called back into detective work due to a friend's disappearance and the possibility he was also involved in a murder. Murder, malarkey and mirth are about to become the order of the day. It was the big surprise hit of 1934. Afforded only a tiny budget because studio head honcho Louis B. Mayer thought it was dud material, and ordered to be completed in under three weeks time, film made stars out of Powell and Loy and coined an impressive $2 million at the box office. Also birthing a franchise (5 film sequels and a radio and television series would follow), it's a film that has irresistible charm leaping out from every frame. It's easy to see even now why a mid 1930's audience could take so warmly to such an appealing motion picture. From the off the film was in good hands, Dyke (One-Take Woody as he was sometimes known) was an unfussy director with a keen eye for pacing and casting, both of which are things that shine through in this production. There's also considerable talent in the writing, both in the source material and with the script writers. Hammett based his witty bantering couple on himself and his relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman, this was ideal material for Hackett and Goodrich, themselves a happily married couple fondly thought of in the cut and thrust world of Hollywood. As a couple they would go on to write It's a Wonderful Life for Frank Capra and win the Pulitzer Prize for their play The Diary of Anne Frank. It stands out as a film of note because it successfully marries a murder mystery story with a screwball comedy spin, this was something new and exciting. While the believable relationship between Powell and Loy was also a breath of fresh air; a married couple deeply in love, devoted, funny, boozey and bouncing off of each other with witty repartee. It can never be overstated just how good Powell and Loy are here, true enough they are given an absolutely zinging script to work from, but the level of comedy, both in visual ticks and delivery of lines, is extraordinarily high. Small budget and a small shoot, but everything else about The Thin Man is big. Big laughs, big mystery and big love, all bundled up into a joyous bit of classic cinema. 9/10

    I saw this after I had seen some of the sequels and was a bit surprised at the very dark storyline surrounding the more light material involved with solving the mystery. In the first scene we see The Thin Man who is a scientist involved in some highly suspect work that eventually gets him killed. We see that he is not a very sympathetic individual, but he does have a soft side when it comes to his daughter. There is some evidence that he is also capable of slapping women around, as indicated in a later scene with his mistress. The first half hour's darkness works surprisingly well with the more lighter material. The sequels were more interested in the shenanigans of Nick and Nora, but here they seem more involved with the sad characters and Nick's one-liners are not as pronounced as the would be in the sequels. Nick and Nora are actually more supporting characters and that may be a bit disappointing. Furtunately, there are many comic highlights involving the geeky son, the inept police and the shrill ex-wife of the scientist. The motive of the murderer is a bit underdeveloped and the ending is a bit of a letdown. It is always the least likely suspect but watch closely and you can actually figure it out pretty quickly. The movie's pace is also a bit slower than its sequels' but that is because of the relatively new adjustment to sound and not a fault of the actors. There is almost no underscoring and that gives it a sort of creepy vibe in the dramatic scenes. Good first movie but the two first sequels were a bit more funny.

    This is the start of an excellent series of Thin Man movies with William Powell and Myrna Loy as the high class couple Nick and Nora Charles, with their dog Asta. Nick is a "retired" cop who has married the rich socialite Nora. Nick is always getting involved in cases the cops can't seem to solve and of course he does solve them. Usually using his old contacts with his old underworld buddies that he had given breaks to over the years. The repartee between the couple is pretty funny at times and Asta is a well trained dog who comes across as cowardly. Both of the Charles's like to drink and party some, my kind of people!! Most of action is fairly low keyed and I think is done to make the audience think.

    This film was based on one book, and because it was so popular it was turned into a six film series, with the lead stars returning for all of them, and this the first film is the one that appeared in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was most interested to watch it. Basically retired detective Nick Charles (Oscar nominated William Powell) and his wife Nora (Myrna Loy) are trying to settle down, but a friend of his, Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), the "thin man" of the title, disappears and may be involved in a murder, so he is pulled back into action to investigate. The man who has vanished is the prime suspect to the murder of his former secretary and girlfriend Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead) as all the evidence points to him, but the one who doesn't believe he has any involvement is his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan), and is the one who convinces the former private eye to take the case. This amuses his wife, but Nick does stumble onto some clues and pieces together the facts for an intense investigation, and he eventually comes to conclude who the murderer really is, but he is not telling anybody his findings until an event he is putting on. All the guests he is inviting are the ones he believes are capable of murder, but he knows only one really did the crime, and a classic dinner party scene, and with explanations of each person's involvement in the recent events, including the skeleton body of missing Mynant found who was killed for his money. Also starring Nat Pendleton as Inspector John Guild , Minna Gombell as Mimi Wynant, Porter Hall as Herbert MacCaulay, Henry Wadsworth as Tommy, William Henry as Gilbert Wynant, Harold Huber as Arthur Nunheim, Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgenson, Edward Brophy as Joe Morelli and Cyril Thornton as Tanner. Powell gives a leading performance with his clever theorising and charming wit, Loy is really likable as his wife who is by his side throughout, together they make a great duo, so it is no wonder that sequels followed, if you like mystery mixed with some good laughs then this good entertainment, a fun classic detective comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for W.S. Van Dyke, Best Picture and Best Writing, Adaptation. It was number 32 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    "The Thin Man" is a smart, sophisticated, urban whodunit staged with Spartan style and little nonsense by W.S. Van Dyke who went on to helm the first three entries in the six film franchise. This was not the first time that mustached William Powell either played a detective or paired up with Myrna Loy. They co-starred in several movies before and after "The Thin Man" series, such "Manhattan Melodrama," "The Great Ziegfeld," "Libeled Lady," "Double Wedding," "Love Crazy," "I Love You Again," and "Evelyn Prentice." This clever mystery thriller unfolds in three-acts. The suspects and the situation are laid out in crisp, expository fashion, and then we meet Nick & Nora Charles who become involved in the mystery. It seems our hero knew one of the suspects. This association draws him into the investigation. All this is capped off with a huge party that Nick throws for the suspects to smoke out the murderer. A variety of characters make up the cast. Remember, M-G-M produced this mystery back in 1934, when Hollywood couldn't depict violence with any realistic detail. As it is, "The Thin Man" looks like a drinking man's champ. Our hero guzzles and so do many others. Nick has guzzled six martinis by the time his wife joins him in the bar. This 91-minute melodrama qualifies as a Christmas movie because it occurs during the holiday season. The dialogue is often snappy, especially the being "shot five times in the tabloids." The secretary of an eccentric scientist, Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead of "The King Murder"), has been murdered. The eccentric scientist, Gilbert Wynant (William Henry of "Rubber Racketeers"), vanishes afterward without a trace. Earlier, Wynant's wife Mimi (Minna Gombell of "High Sierra") divorced him because of a fling with Ms. Wolf. Worst, the conniving secretary was up to no good under Wynant's very nose. Quietly enough, Julia had been embezzling money; she cashed in two bonds amounting to $50-thousand. Wynant catches her with a gangster, Morelli (Edward Brophy), and they quarrel about the kind of men that she ahs been seeing. Gilbert Wynant is the jealous type. Myrna Loy's entrance in the action is funny. Asta literally drags her with packages piled up in her arms. Later, Wynant's attorney Herbert MacCaulay (Porter Hall of "His Girl Friday"), inquires if Nick is sleuthing for Wynant's ex-wife. Nick informs MacCaulay he gave up being a private eye four years ago. "My wife's father died and left her a narrow gauge railway, and a lumber mill, and several other things. I'm taking care of them." When they have this conversation, Wynant has been missing for three months. The first entry in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's "Thin Man" franchise, "The Thin Man," takes about twenty minutes before Nick Charles (William Powell) makes his entrance. He is teaching bartenders how to mix various alcoholic beverages. "You see, the important thing is the rhythm. You should always have rhythm in your shaking. "A Manhattan you shake to a fox trot. A Bronx to a two-step time. A dry martini you always shake to waltzes." When he completes this elaboration lecture, Nick takes the drink that he prepared so fastidiously and sips it. Wynant's daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan of "Tarzan of the Apes") walks up to him and informs him that she remembers him from a case. Dorothy is searching for her father. Mimi goes to see Julia Wolf about getting more money. Morelli (Edward Brophy of "All Through the Night") learns about Julia's murder and barges into Nick's apartment. Morelli tries to kill Nick, and the authorities are suspicious about our hero. The police confiscate an unregistered gun and promise to ask him more questions. Nick Charles hasn't worked on a case as a private eye for four years. Since he has married Mrs. Charles, he handles his wife's considerable affairs. Eventually, Inspector John Guild (Nat Pendleton of "Trapped by Television") convinces Nick to work with them. Nora persuades Nick to take the case after the fugitive, Gilbert Wynant sends him a request to investigate the case. Reluctantly, Nick takes Asta and goes prowling in the dark. He uncovers an unidentified body in Wynant's laboratory. Meantime, the police and the press believe that Wynant has killed three people. The use of modern technology at the time helps Nick to find the answer that he is looking for but nobody else knows. Nick and Nora are a couple to watch.

    "The Thin Man" (1934) is one of the best films ever made....a great stage play made into a great movie. It was originally a stage play written by Dashiell Hammett, and no doubt retained most of Hammett's great writing when Albert Hackett and his then young wife, Frances Goodrich turned the play into a movie script. This was the first important movie where the lead romantic couple exchange in banter and "repartee" which reflected the acceptance (finally) in the 1930's the "the independent woman" (even married independent women!) in USA culture, less than two decades after women finally "got the vote." Major players and minor supporting actors in "The Thin Man" (1934) are all lovable, and that includes the villain, lawyer Herbert MacCauley, marvelously portrayed by long time movie character actor of note, Porter Hall. The story is a "Whodunit" and the audience never guesses the real culprit until the penultimate scene (the next to the last scene) when hero detective, Nick Charles (played to perfection by William Powell), hosts a grand dinner for half a dozen likely suspects (and police in attendance, too, both as tuxedo clad guests and also as waiter staffers!), and fingers the guilty guy. Many people opine that the best final scene in any movie is the one in Casablanca (1943) where Humphrey Bogart (playing "Rick Blaine") tells Claude Rains (playing the French "Prefect Of Police" who just helped Bogart and now becomes a fugitive along with Bogart) tells his new friend, and fellow accomplice, "Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship." But I think "The Thin Man" (1934) has the best final scene of all. It's a rapid fire "end of the film" portrait of the Nick and Nora Charles married couple about to get to bed in a moving railroad train private room, this in a movie which shows the two alone together in bedrooms before with nothing sexy at all happening between them. The audience sees unexpected beginnings of "married love," and the camera switches instantly to the nighttime train entering a tunnel with the "San Francisco, Here I Come" tune played brightly and zestfully. Alfred Hitchcock used the same "affectionate couple (Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint) about to get into bed together on a train, then quick switch to train entering a tunnel" at the end of "North By Northwest" (1959), but that movie ending didn't have "San Francisco, Here I Come" music along with it, and that makes all the difference! ---------------------- Written by David R.

    There wasn't any film noir at the time. There were a few early notions formed in Weimar Germany about dazed minds succumbing to control of storymakers. The femme fatale was beginning to get shape as a force in the story. And then there was the detective film; each studio run its own highly successful series, each one influenced by the one before. Fox had Charlie Chan, and less famously Peter Lorre's Mr. Moto. Monogram responded with the Chinese Mr. Wong. RKO had Withers. Warners run the Perry Mason cycle. These were more or less debonair sleuths, gentle, delicate beings, after the stereotypical notion for Sherlock Holmes. And of course The Thin Man, I believe six films in total pairing William Powell with Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, dilettantes and sleuths, also openly quoting Holmes. The game here is that the detective plot is incidental to the story and only the hook that lets all the other effects sink in. The screwball comedy, the sexual innuendo, the fashions, the wit as dry as the martinis. You may piece something together but quite apart from what sleuthing is going on; no one is really sure if the sleuth is on the case or not, including him, the clues and suspects are laid out on his living-room in the middle of a party and they're merely a lot of noise that gets in the way of sipping one martini after another. Our introduction to Nick is where he's showing waiters how to shake cocktails, foreshadowing handling of the case to us. Naturally he pieces everything together in the final explanatory denouement; a dinner party with all the suspects invited, one of them the killer. No device is more contrived these days, in part because it used to work so well. You didn't have to puzzle about any of this, or fates in control of the thing, because there were none. All you had to do was kick back and sip at all the extraordinary chintz of the sleuthing. This type of film culminates in the Maltese Falcon, incidentally also adapted from Hammett and the shift towards noir proper. The more elaborate trick there was that all the suspects were aware of a ridiculous detective film going on, and constantly switched between elated viewers and mischievous storymakers. Sam Spade's main assets were great acting and making up stories. The only mischief going on here is between Nick and Nora, who constantly wink at each other about sex they're not having - until the end. Their chemistry sizzles in a way that deep love does.

    The Thin Man (1934) was directed by W.S. Van Dyke. This picture has an extremely high IMDb weighted average of 8.1. I had great hopes for this film, which we saw at a New Year's eve showing at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman House in Rochester. I'm sorry to report that the film didn't work for me at any level. William Powell and Myrna Loy play Nick and Nora Charles. He's a former detective, she's an heiress. They are rich, glamorous, and very, very sophisticated. Powell and Loy were wildly popular in these roles, and reprised them again and again. Powell more or less looks the part, but I think Loy was miscast. She looks and acts like one of the bright, snappy, working-class women in a screwball comedy. She doesn't look or act like an heiress. A second problem I had with the film was the unending focus on alcohol consumption. Getting and being drunk was far more acceptable in society then than it is now. Even so, the film really wasn't about mystery or romance--it was about drinking. People are endlessly talking about drinking, or they're drinking, or they're holding icepacks to their heads on the morning after. Powell acts half-drunk for most of the film. (For the rest of the film he acts drunk.) I just don't find that entertaining. For me, the highlight of the evening happened before the film. The Eastman House volunteer who presented the film came dressed in a long, slinky, 1930's-style gown. She gave a witty, intelligent talk. This woman had the physical and mental attributes that would have made her a perfect Nora Charles. It's too bad that her role ended when the lights in the theater dimmed. P.S. I rarely post negative reviews of films that other IMDb reviewers have liked. That's not because I'm timid, but rather because if others liked them, I usually like them too. However, on the rare occasion when I've criticized a popular film, I've been sent some abusive personal comments. If you disagree with me, I'm happy to have you tell me so. Maybe I'll learn why other people think this film is so good. However, please don't use the opportunity to comment on my parentage, my species, or the depth of my mental inadequacies. Thanks, Red-125

    The Thin Man is directed by W.S Van Dyke,produced by Hunt Stromberg,with a screenplay written by Albert Hackett(based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett)and stars William Powell,Myrna Loy,Maureen O'Sullivan and Cesar Romero. Powell and Loy's chemistry in the film Manhattan Melodrama(1934)was so impressive that Van Dyke made sure they starred in his next film The Thin Man.It is in the Thin Man that they really shine together,both perfectly in tune with one another creating one of the most memorable screen marriages ever seen.In their hands Nick and Nora become a unique couple who not only love each other,they like each other and treat each other as complete equals. Former Private Detective Nick Charles(William Powell)returns home to New York with his new wife Nora(Myrna Loy)and the couples adorable dog Asta.Nick's approached by an old friend Dorothy Wynant(Maureen O'Sullivan)who's father Clyde(Edward Ellis)is the prime suspect in the murder of her Dorothy's stepmother.She doesn't believe the charge for a second,not just for personal intuition but for the fact her father has been missing for a while.She asks Nick to look for him and he eventually agrees to take on the case.Aided by Nora Nick sinks his teeth into the mystery of the Thin Man and at an unforgettable dinner party reveals both who the real murderer is and the fate of the missing man. One of the most discussed aspects of this film is Nick and Nora's constant drinking.Powell's laconic Nick may at times seem like an alcoholic but he is never out of control and slips back and forth between giddy charmer and active,sober sleuth with such ease your never quite sure if his drinking is all an act.In Loy's case she makes Nora's drinking seem both sophisticated and simply a natural extension of this elegant young woman's personality. The amount of booze consumed in the film truly reaches almost farcical levels at times(perhaps a nod to the Great Depression,now it's over lets live the good life).Despite that it somehow fits as an almost necessary element to the story(it's presence adds greatly to the films comedy). It's pointless watching this for the story,it's convoluted and quite frankly distracts from the relationship between Nick and Nora.It is they and not the plot,who are the films strongest point.The snappy banter between the two is expertly written,with lines often not striking the audience as funny until several seconds after they are spoken.The deep affection Nick has for Nora often doesn't require words, it's present simply in the looks the couple share,and she in turn adores him and wants to share in his work,even when danger threatens. Powell and Loy starred in several sequels and The Thin Man was obviously the inspiration for TV series such as Hart To Hart.Witty,exciting and complex you should seek out the Thin Man as soon as possible,you won't be disappointed.

    THE THIN MAN (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1934), directed by W.S. Van Dyke, from the novel by Dashiell Hammett, is a classic mystery-comedy that helped establish the careers of both its leading performers, William Powell and Myrna Loy, Powell especially, in a performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination. There have been mystery-comedies prior to this, A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT (Allied, 1933) with Ginger Rogers and Lyle Talbot as rival news reporters that immediately comes to mind, but THE THIN MAN stands in a class by itself. With the plot set in New York City at the start of the Christmas season, the ten minute prologue begins with Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), an absent-minded inventor, who discovers that his secretary, Julia Wolfe (Natalie Moorehead), with whom he has been carrying on a romancer, has stolen $50,000 worth of government bonds he's been saving for the upcoming wedding of his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan) to Andrew (Henry Wadsworth). Wynant confronts Julia with his accusations, and after learning the truth, he angrily walks out of the apartment down the dark streets alone. The story gets underway as Wynant's ex-wife, Mimi (Minna Gombell), in desperate need of money, comes to visit Julia to learn of Wynant's whereabouts. After entering the apartment, she finds her dead. Before the police are called, Mimi takes something from Julia's hand belonging to Wynant, and withholds the item as possible evidence. As for Dorothy, she suspects something terribly wrong when her father, away on a secret trip unknown even to his personal attorney, Herbert McCauley (Porter Hall), hasn't returned in time for the wedding. She soon takes her worries to Nick Charles (William Powell), a friend of the family having a time of his life drinking cocktails in a speakeasy. Nick, a former detective visiting from San Francisco with his wealthy wife, Nora (Myrna Loy), is asked to investigate. At first Nick declines, but after three additional murders take place, linking it all to gray-haired thin man, Wynant, now missing for three months, Nick, at Nora's urging, comes out of his four years of carefree living to look into the case. Along with Lieutenant John Guild (Nat Pendleton) and his dog, Asta, Nick stumbles upon some clues while investigating in Wynant's workshop, to surprising and unexpected results. Suspects in question include William Henry as Wynant's studious intellectual son, Gilbert; Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgensen, a lazy loafer living off Mimi; and Julia's gangster acquaintances played by Edward Brophy (Joe Morelli); and Harold Huber (Nunheimer), the latter being murder victim number three. Then there's Bert Roach being the overgrown crybaby guest at the Christmas Eve party wanting to use Nick's phone to call his "maw" long distance. The success or failure for any motion picture relies simply on fine scripting (Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich) and perfect casting. THE THIN MAN succeeds on those counts and chemistry by Powell and Loy. Having already some detective experience to his name, that of Philo Vance on three separate occasions, "The Canary Murder Case" 1929); "The Benson Murder Case" (1930 and "The Kennel Murder Case" (1933), Powell's Nick Charles, unlike any other detective commonly found in motion picture mysteries, is very much witty, down to earth, and of course, married. Rather than typically presenting a detective sleuthing with a male counterpart as comedy relief, a gal reporter, or very much alone, Nick Charles is assisted by Asta, his wire-haired fox terrier. Observant and clever with his deductions, Nick Charles is also quick with his responses, a fondness for liquor and fun at parties. His friends are usually ex-cons whom he's "sent up the river,"holding no grudge against him. Myrna Loy has found her true character in Nora Charles. Breaking away from the stereotype bossy spouse, she accepts her husband for what and whom he is, and equals with his enjoyment of fun and mystery combined. Great scene captures her sitting on the couch gowned in fur coat calmly watching her husband being a little boy at heart playing with the sling shot he's gotten for Christmas, shooting away the ornaments hanging on the Christmas tree one by one. As much as Nora would prefer sleuthing with him during his investigations, she seldom gets that chance. The climatic finish where Nick summons all connected with the case at the dinner gathering is well constructed in both humor and suspense. The success of THE THIN MAN not only brought forth many imitations, but five additional sequels starring Powell and Loy, along with the basis of a 1957-59 television series starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk, but nothing to compare with the 1934 original, being the most famous and revived of all the "Thin Man" presentations combined. Distributed to video cassette as early as the 1980s by MGM Home Video enclosed in plastic clam shells, cable television presentations on the Disney Channel's "Best of Hollywood" in the 1990s, Turner Classic Movies from 1994 onward, and finally DVD where this and others continue to acquire both a new audience along with those who know who the killer is but to just simply want to watch over and over again in the manner of Nick and Nora Charles, just for the fun of it.

    The Thin Man is directed by W. S. Van Dyke and co-written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. It is based on the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name. Starring are William Powell and Myrna Loy, with support coming from Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Porter Hall and Skippy as Astra the dog. William Axt scores the music and James Wong Howe is the cinematographer. Plot finds Powell and Loy as married couple, Nick and Nora Charles, he is a retired detective, she a good time heiress. Planning to finally settle down, their life is upturned when Nick is called back into detective work due to a friend's disappearance and the possibility he was also involved in a murder. Murder, malarkey and mirth are about to become the order of the day. It was the big surprise hit of 1934. Afforded only a tiny budget because studio head honcho Louis B. Mayer thought it was dud material, and ordered to be completed in under three weeks time, film made stars out of Powell and Loy and coined an impressive $2 million at the box office. Also birthing a franchise (5 film sequels and a radio and television series would follow), it's a film that has irresistible charm leaping out from every frame. It's easy to see even now why a mid 1930's audience could take so warmly to such an appealing motion picture. From the off the film was in good hands, Dyke (One-Take Woody as he was sometimes known) was an unfussy director with a keen eye for pacing and casting, both of which are things that shine through in this production. There's also considerable talent in the writing, both in the source material and with the script writers. Hammett based his witty bantering couple on himself and his relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman, this was ideal material for Hackett and Goodrich, themselves a happily married couple fondly thought of in the cut and thrust world of Hollywood. As a couple they would go on to write It's a Wonderful Life for Frank Capra and win the Pulitzer Prize for their play The Diary of Anne Frank. It stands out as a film of note because it successfully marries a murder mystery story with a screwball comedy spin, this was something new and exciting. While the believable relationship between Powell and Loy was also a breath of fresh air; a married couple deeply in love, devoted, funny, boozey and bouncing off of each other with witty repartee. It can never be overstated just how good Powell and Loy are here, true enough they are given an absolutely zinging script to work from, but the level of comedy, both in visual ticks and delivery of lines, is extraordinarily high. Small budget and a small shoot, but everything else about The Thin Man is big. Big laughs, big mystery and big love, all bundled up into a joyous bit of classic cinema. 9/10

    I saw this after I had seen some of the sequels and was a bit surprised at the very dark storyline surrounding the more light material involved with solving the mystery. In the first scene we see The Thin Man who is a scientist involved in some highly suspect work that eventually gets him killed. We see that he is not a very sympathetic individual, but he does have a soft side when it comes to his daughter. There is some evidence that he is also capable of slapping women around, as indicated in a later scene with his mistress. The first half hour's darkness works surprisingly well with the more lighter material. The sequels were more interested in the shenanigans of Nick and Nora, but here they seem more involved with the sad characters and Nick's one-liners are not as pronounced as the would be in the sequels. Nick and Nora are actually more supporting characters and that may be a bit disappointing. Furtunately, there are many comic highlights involving the geeky son, the inept police and the shrill ex-wife of the scientist. The motive of the murderer is a bit underdeveloped and the ending is a bit of a letdown. It is always the least likely suspect but watch closely and you can actually figure it out pretty quickly. The movie's pace is also a bit slower than its sequels' but that is because of the relatively new adjustment to sound and not a fault of the actors. There is almost no underscoring and that gives it a sort of creepy vibe in the dramatic scenes. Good first movie but the two first sequels were a bit more funny.

    This is the start of an excellent series of Thin Man movies with William Powell and Myrna Loy as the high class couple Nick and Nora Charles, with their dog Asta. Nick is a "retired" cop who has married the rich socialite Nora. Nick is always getting involved in cases the cops can't seem to solve and of course he does solve them. Usually using his old contacts with his old underworld buddies that he had given breaks to over the years. The repartee between the couple is pretty funny at times and Asta is a well trained dog who comes across as cowardly. Both of the Charles's like to drink and party some, my kind of people!! Most of action is fairly low keyed and I think is done to make the audience think.

    This film was based on one book, and because it was so popular it was turned into a six film series, with the lead stars returning for all of them, and this the first film is the one that appeared in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was most interested to watch it. Basically retired detective Nick Charles (Oscar nominated William Powell) and his wife Nora (Myrna Loy) are trying to settle down, but a friend of his, Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), the "thin man" of the title, disappears and may be involved in a murder, so he is pulled back into action to investigate. The man who has vanished is the prime suspect to the murder of his former secretary and girlfriend Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead) as all the evidence points to him, but the one who doesn't believe he has any involvement is his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan), and is the one who convinces the former private eye to take the case. This amuses his wife, but Nick does stumble onto some clues and pieces together the facts for an intense investigation, and he eventually comes to conclude who the murderer really is, but he is not telling anybody his findings until an event he is putting on. All the guests he is inviting are the ones he believes are capable of murder, but he knows only one really did the crime, and a classic dinner party scene, and with explanations of each person's involvement in the recent events, including the skeleton body of missing Mynant found who was killed for his money. Also starring Nat Pendleton as Inspector John Guild , Minna Gombell as Mimi Wynant, Porter Hall as Herbert MacCaulay, Henry Wadsworth as Tommy, William Henry as Gilbert Wynant, Harold Huber as Arthur Nunheim, Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgenson, Edward Brophy as Joe Morelli and Cyril Thornton as Tanner. Powell gives a leading performance with his clever theorising and charming wit, Loy is really likable as his wife who is by his side throughout, together they make a great duo, so it is no wonder that sequels followed, if you like mystery mixed with some good laughs then this good entertainment, a fun classic detective comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for W.S. Van Dyke, Best Picture and Best Writing, Adaptation. It was number 32 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    "The Thin Man" is a smart, sophisticated, urban whodunit staged with Spartan style and little nonsense by W.S. Van Dyke who went on to helm the first three entries in the six film franchise. This was not the first time that mustached William Powell either played a detective or paired up with Myrna Loy. They co-starred in several movies before and after "The Thin Man" series, such "Manhattan Melodrama," "The Great Ziegfeld," "Libeled Lady," "Double Wedding," "Love Crazy," "I Love You Again," and "Evelyn Prentice." This clever mystery thriller unfolds in three-acts. The suspects and the situation are laid out in crisp, expository fashion, and then we meet Nick & Nora Charles who become involved in the mystery. It seems our hero knew one of the suspects. This association draws him into the investigation. All this is capped off with a huge party that Nick throws for the suspects to smoke out the murderer. A variety of characters make up the cast. Remember, M-G-M produced this mystery back in 1934, when Hollywood couldn't depict violence with any realistic detail. As it is, "The Thin Man" looks like a drinking man's champ. Our hero guzzles and so do many others. Nick has guzzled six martinis by the time his wife joins him in the bar. This 91-minute melodrama qualifies as a Christmas movie because it occurs during the holiday season. The dialogue is often snappy, especially the being "shot five times in the tabloids." The secretary of an eccentric scientist, Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead of "The King Murder"), has been murdered. The eccentric scientist, Gilbert Wynant (William Henry of "Rubber Racketeers"), vanishes afterward without a trace. Earlier, Wynant's wife Mimi (Minna Gombell of "High Sierra") divorced him because of a fling with Ms. Wolf. Worst, the conniving secretary was up to no good under Wynant's very nose. Quietly enough, Julia had been embezzling money; she cashed in two bonds amounting to $50-thousand. Wynant catches her with a gangster, Morelli (Edward Brophy), and they quarrel about the kind of men that she ahs been seeing. Gilbert Wynant is the jealous type. Myrna Loy's entrance in the action is funny. Asta literally drags her with packages piled up in her arms. Later, Wynant's attorney Herbert MacCaulay (Porter Hall of "His Girl Friday"), inquires if Nick is sleuthing for Wynant's ex-wife. Nick informs MacCaulay he gave up being a private eye four years ago. "My wife's father died and left her a narrow gauge railway, and a lumber mill, and several other things. I'm taking care of them." When they have this conversation, Wynant has been missing for three months. The first entry in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's "Thin Man" franchise, "The Thin Man," takes about twenty minutes before Nick Charles (William Powell) makes his entrance. He is teaching bartenders how to mix various alcoholic beverages. "You see, the important thing is the rhythm. You should always have rhythm in your shaking. "A Manhattan you shake to a fox trot. A Bronx to a two-step time. A dry martini you always shake to waltzes." When he completes this elaboration lecture, Nick takes the drink that he prepared so fastidiously and sips it. Wynant's daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan of "Tarzan of the Apes") walks up to him and informs him that she remembers him from a case. Dorothy is searching for her father. Mimi goes to see Julia Wolf about getting more money. Morelli (Edward Brophy of "All Through the Night") learns about Julia's murder and barges into Nick's apartment. Morelli tries to kill Nick, and the authorities are suspicious about our hero. The police confiscate an unregistered gun and promise to ask him more questions. Nick Charles hasn't worked on a case as a private eye for four years. Since he has married Mrs. Charles, he handles his wife's considerable affairs. Eventually, Inspector John Guild (Nat Pendleton of "Trapped by Television") convinces Nick to work with them. Nora persuades Nick to take the case after the fugitive, Gilbert Wynant sends him a request to investigate the case. Reluctantly, Nick takes Asta and goes prowling in the dark. He uncovers an unidentified body in Wynant's laboratory. Meantime, the police and the press believe that Wynant has killed three people. The use of modern technology at the time helps Nick to find the answer that he is looking for but nobody else knows. Nick and Nora are a couple to watch.

    "The Thin Man" (1934) is one of the best films ever made....a great stage play made into a great movie. It was originally a stage play written by Dashiell Hammett, and no doubt retained most of Hammett's great writing when Albert Hackett and his then young wife, Frances Goodrich turned the play into a movie script. This was the first important movie where the lead romantic couple exchange in banter and "repartee" which reflected the acceptance (finally) in the 1930's the "the independent woman" (even married independent women!) in USA culture, less than two decades after women finally "got the vote." Major players and minor supporting actors in "The Thin Man" (1934) are all lovable, and that includes the villain, lawyer Herbert MacCauley, marvelously portrayed by long time movie character actor of note, Porter Hall. The story is a "Whodunit" and the audience never guesses the real culprit until the penultimate scene (the next to the last scene) when hero detective, Nick Charles (played to perfection by William Powell), hosts a grand dinner for half a dozen likely suspects (and police in attendance, too, both as tuxedo clad guests and also as waiter staffers!), and fingers the guilty guy. Many people opine that the best final scene in any movie is the one in Casablanca (1943) where Humphrey Bogart (playing "Rick Blaine") tells Claude Rains (playing the French "Prefect Of Police" who just helped Bogart and now becomes a fugitive along with Bogart) tells his new friend, and fellow accomplice, "Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship." But I think "The Thin Man" (1934) has the best final scene of all. It's a rapid fire "end of the film" portrait of the Nick and Nora Charles married couple about to get to bed in a moving railroad train private room, this in a movie which shows the two alone together in bedrooms before with nothing sexy at all happening between them. The audience sees unexpected beginnings of "married love," and the camera switches instantly to the nighttime train entering a tunnel with the "San Francisco, Here I Come" tune played brightly and zestfully. Alfred Hitchcock used the same "affectionate couple (Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint) about to get into bed together on a train, then quick switch to train entering a tunnel" at the end of "North By Northwest" (1959), but that movie ending didn't have "San Francisco, Here I Come" music along with it, and that makes all the difference! ---------------------- Written by David R.

    There wasn't any film noir at the time. There were a few early notions formed in Weimar Germany about dazed minds succumbing to control of storymakers. The femme fatale was beginning to get shape as a force in the story. And then there was the detective film; each studio run its own highly successful series, each one influenced by the one before. Fox had Charlie Chan, and less famously Peter Lorre's Mr. Moto. Monogram responded with the Chinese Mr. Wong. RKO had Withers. Warners run the Perry Mason cycle. These were more or less debonair sleuths, gentle, delicate beings, after the stereotypical notion for Sherlock Holmes. And of course The Thin Man, I believe six films in total pairing William Powell with Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, dilettantes and sleuths, also openly quoting Holmes. The game here is that the detective plot is incidental to the story and only the hook that lets all the other effects sink in. The screwball comedy, the sexual innuendo, the fashions, the wit as dry as the martinis. You may piece something together but quite apart from what sleuthing is going on; no one is really sure if the sleuth is on the case or not, including him, the clues and suspects are laid out on his living-room in the middle of a party and they're merely a lot of noise that gets in the way of sipping one martini after another. Our introduction to Nick is where he's showing waiters how to shake cocktails, foreshadowing handling of the case to us. Naturally he pieces everything together in the final explanatory denouement; a dinner party with all the suspects invited, one of them the killer. No device is more contrived these days, in part because it used to work so well. You didn't have to puzzle about any of this, or fates in control of the thing, because there were none. All you had to do was kick back and sip at all the extraordinary chintz of the sleuthing. This type of film culminates in the Maltese Falcon, incidentally also adapted from Hammett and the shift towards noir proper. The more elaborate trick there was that all the suspects were aware of a ridiculous detective film going on, and constantly switched between elated viewers and mischievous storymakers. Sam Spade's main assets were great acting and making up stories. The only mischief going on here is between Nick and Nora, who constantly wink at each other about sex they're not having - until the end. Their chemistry sizzles in a way that deep love does.

    The Thin Man (1934) was directed by W.S. Van Dyke. This picture has an extremely high IMDb weighted average of 8.1. I had great hopes for this film, which we saw at a New Year's eve showing at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman House in Rochester. I'm sorry to report that the film didn't work for me at any level. William Powell and Myrna Loy play Nick and Nora Charles. He's a former detective, she's an heiress. They are rich, glamorous, and very, very sophisticated. Powell and Loy were wildly popular in these roles, and reprised them again and again. Powell more or less looks the part, but I think Loy was miscast. She looks and acts like one of the bright, snappy, working-class women in a screwball comedy. She doesn't look or act like an heiress. A second problem I had with the film was the unending focus on alcohol consumption. Getting and being drunk was far more acceptable in society then than it is now. Even so, the film really wasn't about mystery or romance--it was about drinking. People are endlessly talking about drinking, or they're drinking, or they're holding icepacks to their heads on the morning after. Powell acts half-drunk for most of the film. (For the rest of the film he acts drunk.) I just don't find that entertaining. For me, the highlight of the evening happened before the film. The Eastman House volunteer who presented the film came dressed in a long, slinky, 1930's-style gown. She gave a witty, intelligent talk. This woman had the physical and mental attributes that would have made her a perfect Nora Charles. It's too bad that her role ended when the lights in the theater dimmed. P.S. I rarely post negative reviews of films that other IMDb reviewers have liked. That's not because I'm timid, but rather because if others liked them, I usually like them too. However, on the rare occasion when I've criticized a popular film, I've been sent some abusive personal comments. If you disagree with me, I'm happy to have you tell me so. Maybe I'll learn why other people think this film is so good. However, please don't use the opportunity to comment on my parentage, my species, or the depth of my mental inadequacies. Thanks, Red-125

    The Thin Man is directed by W.S Van Dyke,produced by Hunt Stromberg,with a screenplay written by Albert Hackett(based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett)and stars William Powell,Myrna Loy,Maureen O'Sullivan and Cesar Romero. Powell and Loy's chemistry in the film Manhattan Melodrama(1934)was so impressive that Van Dyke made sure they starred in his next film The Thin Man.It is in the Thin Man that they really shine together,both perfectly in tune with one another creating one of the most memorable screen marriages ever seen.In their hands Nick and Nora become a unique couple who not only love each other,they like each other and treat each other as complete equals. Former Private Detective Nick Charles(William Powell)returns home to New York with his new wife Nora(Myrna Loy)and the couples adorable dog Asta.Nick's approached by an old friend Dorothy Wynant(Maureen O'Sullivan)who's father Clyde(Edward Ellis)is the prime suspect in the murder of her Dorothy's stepmother.She doesn't believe the charge for a second,not just for personal intuition but for the fact her father has been missing for a while.She asks Nick to look for him and he eventually agrees to take on the case.Aided by Nora Nick sinks his teeth into the mystery of the Thin Man and at an unforgettable dinner party reveals both who the real murderer is and the fate of the missing man. One of the most discussed aspects of this film is Nick and Nora's constant drinking.Powell's laconic Nick may at times seem like an alcoholic but he is never out of control and slips back and forth between giddy charmer and active,sober sleuth with such ease your never quite sure if his drinking is all an act.In Loy's case she makes Nora's drinking seem both sophisticated and simply a natural extension of this elegant young woman's personality. The amount of booze consumed in the film truly reaches almost farcical levels at times(perhaps a nod to the Great Depression,now it's over lets live the good life).Despite that it somehow fits as an almost necessary element to the story(it's presence adds greatly to the films comedy). It's pointless watching this for the story,it's convoluted and quite frankly distracts from the relationship between Nick and Nora.It is they and not the plot,who are the films strongest point.The snappy banter between the two is expertly written,with lines often not striking the audience as funny until several seconds after they are spoken.The deep affection Nick has for Nora often doesn't require words, it's present simply in the looks the couple share,and she in turn adores him and wants to share in his work,even when danger threatens. Powell and Loy starred in several sequels and The Thin Man was obviously the inspiration for TV series such as Hart To Hart.Witty,exciting and complex you should seek out the Thin Man as soon as possible,you won't be disappointed.

    THE THIN MAN (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1934), directed by W.S. Van Dyke, from the novel by Dashiell Hammett, is a classic mystery-comedy that helped establish the careers of both its leading performers, William Powell and Myrna Loy, Powell especially, in a performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination. There have been mystery-comedies prior to this, A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT (Allied, 1933) with Ginger Rogers and Lyle Talbot as rival news reporters that immediately comes to mind, but THE THIN MAN stands in a class by itself. With the plot set in New York City at the start of the Christmas season, the ten minute prologue begins with Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), an absent-minded inventor, who discovers that his secretary, Julia Wolfe (Natalie Moorehead), with whom he has been carrying on a romancer, has stolen $50,000 worth of government bonds he's been saving for the upcoming wedding of his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan) to Andrew (Henry Wadsworth). Wynant confronts Julia with his accusations, and after learning the truth, he angrily walks out of the apartment down the dark streets alone. The story gets underway as Wynant's ex-wife, Mimi (Minna Gombell), in desperate need of money, comes to visit Julia to learn of Wynant's whereabouts. After entering the apartment, she finds her dead. Before the police are called, Mimi takes something from Julia's hand belonging to Wynant, and withholds the item as possible evidence. As for Dorothy, she suspects something terribly wrong when her father, away on a secret trip unknown even to his personal attorney, Herbert McCauley (Porter Hall), hasn't returned in time for the wedding. She soon takes her worries to Nick Charles (William Powell), a friend of the family having a time of his life drinking cocktails in a speakeasy. Nick, a former detective visiting from San Francisco with his wealthy wife, Nora (Myrna Loy), is asked to investigate. At first Nick declines, but after three additional murders take place, linking it all to gray-haired thin man, Wynant, now missing for three months, Nick, at Nora's urging, comes out of his four years of carefree living to look into the case. Along with Lieutenant John Guild (Nat Pendleton) and his dog, Asta, Nick stumbles upon some clues while investigating in Wynant's workshop, to surprising and unexpected results. Suspects in question include William Henry as Wynant's studious intellectual son, Gilbert; Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgensen, a lazy loafer living off Mimi; and Julia's gangster acquaintances played by Edward Brophy (Joe Morelli); and Harold Huber (Nunheimer), the latter being murder victim number three. Then there's Bert Roach being the overgrown crybaby guest at the Christmas Eve party wanting to use Nick's phone to call his "maw" long distance. The success or failure for any motion picture relies simply on fine scripting (Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich) and perfect casting. THE THIN MAN succeeds on those counts and chemistry by Powell and Loy. Having already some detective experience to his name, that of Philo Vance on three separate occasions, "The Canary Murder Case" 1929); "The Benson Murder Case" (1930 and "The Kennel Murder Case" (1933), Powell's Nick Charles, unlike any other detective commonly found in motion picture mysteries, is very much witty, down to earth, and of course, married. Rather than typically presenting a detective sleuthing with a male counterpart as comedy relief, a gal reporter, or very much alone, Nick Charles is assisted by Asta, his wire-haired fox terrier. Observant and clever with his deductions, Nick Charles is also quick with his responses, a fondness for liquor and fun at parties. His friends are usually ex-cons whom he's "sent up the river,"holding no grudge against him. Myrna Loy has found her true character in Nora Charles. Breaking away from the stereotype bossy spouse, she accepts her husband for what and whom he is, and equals with his enjoyment of fun and mystery combined. Great scene captures her sitting on the couch gowned in fur coat calmly watching her husband being a little boy at heart playing with the sling shot he's gotten for Christmas, shooting away the ornaments hanging on the Christmas tree one by one. As much as Nora would prefer sleuthing with him during his investigations, she seldom gets that chance. The climatic finish where Nick summons all connected with the case at the dinner gathering is well constructed in both humor and suspense. The success of THE THIN MAN not only brought forth many imitations, but five additional sequels starring Powell and Loy, along with the basis of a 1957-59 television series starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk, but nothing to compare with the 1934 original, being the most famous and revived of all the "Thin Man" presentations combined. Distributed to video cassette as early as the 1980s by MGM Home Video enclosed in plastic clam shells, cable television presentations on the Disney Channel's "Best of Hollywood" in the 1990s, Turner Classic Movies from 1994 onward, and finally DVD where this and others continue to acquire both a new audience along with those who know who the killer is but to just simply want to watch over and over again in the manner of Nick and Nora Charles, just for the fun of it.

    The Thin Man is directed by W. S. Van Dyke and co-written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. It is based on the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name. Starring are William Powell and Myrna Loy, with support coming from Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Porter Hall and Skippy as Astra the dog. William Axt scores the music and James Wong Howe is the cinematographer. Plot finds Powell and Loy as married couple, Nick and Nora Charles, he is a retired detective, she a good time heiress. Planning to finally settle down, their life is upturned when Nick is called back into detective work due to a friend's disappearance and the possibility he was also involved in a murder. Murder, malarkey and mirth are about to become the order of the day. It was the big surprise hit of 1934. Afforded only a tiny budget because studio head honcho Louis B. Mayer thought it was dud material, and ordered to be completed in under three weeks time, film made stars out of Powell and Loy and coined an impressive $2 million at the box office. Also birthing a franchise (5 film sequels and a radio and television series would follow), it's a film that has irresistible charm leaping out from every frame. It's easy to see even now why a mid 1930's audience could take so warmly to such an appealing motion picture. From the off the film was in good hands, Dyke (One-Take Woody as he was sometimes known) was an unfussy director with a keen eye for pacing and casting, both of which are things that shine through in this production. There's also considerable talent in the writing, both in the source material and with the script writers. Hammett based his witty bantering couple on himself and his relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman, this was ideal material for Hackett and Goodrich, themselves a happily married couple fondly thought of in the cut and thrust world of Hollywood. As a couple they would go on to write It's a Wonderful Life for Frank Capra and win the Pulitzer Prize for their play The Diary of Anne Frank. It stands out as a film of note because it successfully marries a murder mystery story with a screwball comedy spin, this was something new and exciting. While the believable relationship between Powell and Loy was also a breath of fresh air; a married couple deeply in love, devoted, funny, boozey and bouncing off of each other with witty repartee. It can never be overstated just how good Powell and Loy are here, true enough they are given an absolutely zinging script to work from, but the level of comedy, both in visual ticks and delivery of lines, is extraordinarily high. Small budget and a small shoot, but everything else about The Thin Man is big. Big laughs, big mystery and big love, all bundled up into a joyous bit of classic cinema. 9/10

    I saw this after I had seen some of the sequels and was a bit surprised at the very dark storyline surrounding the more light material involved with solving the mystery. In the first scene we see The Thin Man who is a scientist involved in some highly suspect work that eventually gets him killed. We see that he is not a very sympathetic individual, but he does have a soft side when it comes to his daughter. There is some evidence that he is also capable of slapping women around, as indicated in a later scene with his mistress. The first half hour's darkness works surprisingly well with the more lighter material. The sequels were more interested in the shenanigans of Nick and Nora, but here they seem more involved with the sad characters and Nick's one-liners are not as pronounced as the would be in the sequels. Nick and Nora are actually more supporting characters and that may be a bit disappointing. Furtunately, there are many comic highlights involving the geeky son, the inept police and the shrill ex-wife of the scientist. The motive of the murderer is a bit underdeveloped and the ending is a bit of a letdown. It is always the least likely suspect but watch closely and you can actually figure it out pretty quickly. The movie's pace is also a bit slower than its sequels' but that is because of the relatively new adjustment to sound and not a fault of the actors. There is almost no underscoring and that gives it a sort of creepy vibe in the dramatic scenes. Good first movie but the two first sequels were a bit more funny.

    This is the start of an excellent series of Thin Man movies with William Powell and Myrna Loy as the high class couple Nick and Nora Charles, with their dog Asta. Nick is a "retired" cop who has married the rich socialite Nora. Nick is always getting involved in cases the cops can't seem to solve and of course he does solve them. Usually using his old contacts with his old underworld buddies that he had given breaks to over the years. The repartee between the couple is pretty funny at times and Asta is a well trained dog who comes across as cowardly. Both of the Charles's like to drink and party some, my kind of people!! Most of action is fairly low keyed and I think is done to make the audience think.

    This film was based on one book, and because it was so popular it was turned into a six film series, with the lead stars returning for all of them, and this the first film is the one that appeared in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was most interested to watch it. Basically retired detective Nick Charles (Oscar nominated William Powell) and his wife Nora (Myrna Loy) are trying to settle down, but a friend of his, Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), the "thin man" of the title, disappears and may be involved in a murder, so he is pulled back into action to investigate. The man who has vanished is the prime suspect to the murder of his former secretary and girlfriend Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead) as all the evidence points to him, but the one who doesn't believe he has any involvement is his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan), and is the one who convinces the former private eye to take the case. This amuses his wife, but Nick does stumble onto some clues and pieces together the facts for an intense investigation, and he eventually comes to conclude who the murderer really is, but he is not telling anybody his findings until an event he is putting on. All the guests he is inviting are the ones he believes are capable of murder, but he knows only one really did the crime, and a classic dinner party scene, and with explanations of each person's involvement in the recent events, including the skeleton body of missing Mynant found who was killed for his money. Also starring Nat Pendleton as Inspector John Guild , Minna Gombell as Mimi Wynant, Porter Hall as Herbert MacCaulay, Henry Wadsworth as Tommy, William Henry as Gilbert Wynant, Harold Huber as Arthur Nunheim, Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgenson, Edward Brophy as Joe Morelli and Cyril Thornton as Tanner. Powell gives a leading performance with his clever theorising and charming wit, Loy is really likable as his wife who is by his side throughout, together they make a great duo, so it is no wonder that sequels followed, if you like mystery mixed with some good laughs then this good entertainment, a fun classic detective comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for W.S. Van Dyke, Best Picture and Best Writing, Adaptation. It was number 32 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    "The Thin Man" is a smart, sophisticated, urban whodunit staged with Spartan style and little nonsense by W.S. Van Dyke who went on to helm the first three entries in the six film franchise. This was not the first time that mustached William Powell either played a detective or paired up with Myrna Loy. They co-starred in several movies before and after "The Thin Man" series, such "Manhattan Melodrama," "The Great Ziegfeld," "Libeled Lady," "Double Wedding," "Love Crazy," "I Love You Again," and "Evelyn Prentice." This clever mystery thriller unfolds in three-acts. The suspects and the situation are laid out in crisp, expository fashion, and then we meet Nick & Nora Charles who become involved in the mystery. It seems our hero knew one of the suspects. This association draws him into the investigation. All this is capped off with a huge party that Nick throws for the suspects to smoke out the murderer. A variety of characters make up the cast. Remember, M-G-M produced this mystery back in 1934, when Hollywood couldn't depict violence with any realistic detail. As it is, "The Thin Man" looks like a drinking man's champ. Our hero guzzles and so do many others. Nick has guzzled six martinis by the time his wife joins him in the bar. This 91-minute melodrama qualifies as a Christmas movie because it occurs during the holiday season. The dialogue is often snappy, especially the being "shot five times in the tabloids." The secretary of an eccentric scientist, Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead of "The King Murder"), has been murdered. The eccentric scientist, Gilbert Wynant (William Henry of "Rubber Racketeers"), vanishes afterward without a trace. Earlier, Wynant's wife Mimi (Minna Gombell of "High Sierra") divorced him because of a fling with Ms. Wolf. Worst, the conniving secretary was up to no good under Wynant's very nose. Quietly enough, Julia had been embezzling money; she cashed in two bonds amounting to $50-thousand. Wynant catches her with a gangster, Morelli (Edward Brophy), and they quarrel about the kind of men that she ahs been seeing. Gilbert Wynant is the jealous type. Myrna Loy's entrance in the action is funny. Asta literally drags her with packages piled up in her arms. Later, Wynant's attorney Herbert MacCaulay (Porter Hall of "His Girl Friday"), inquires if Nick is sleuthing for Wynant's ex-wife. Nick informs MacCaulay he gave up being a private eye four years ago. "My wife's father died and left her a narrow gauge railway, and a lumber mill, and several other things. I'm taking care of them." When they have this conversation, Wynant has been missing for three months. The first entry in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's "Thin Man" franchise, "The Thin Man," takes about twenty minutes before Nick Charles (William Powell) makes his entrance. He is teaching bartenders how to mix various alcoholic beverages. "You see, the important thing is the rhythm. You should always have rhythm in your shaking. "A Manhattan you shake to a fox trot. A Bronx to a two-step time. A dry martini you always shake to waltzes." When he completes this elaboration lecture, Nick takes the drink that he prepared so fastidiously and sips it. Wynant's daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan of "Tarzan of the Apes") walks up to him and informs him that she remembers him from a case. Dorothy is searching for her father. Mimi goes to see Julia Wolf about getting more money. Morelli (Edward Brophy of "All Through the Night") learns about Julia's murder and barges into Nick's apartment. Morelli tries to kill Nick, and the authorities are suspicious about our hero. The police confiscate an unregistered gun and promise to ask him more questions. Nick Charles hasn't worked on a case as a private eye for four years. Since he has married Mrs. Charles, he handles his wife's considerable affairs. Eventually, Inspector John Guild (Nat Pendleton of "Trapped by Television") convinces Nick to work with them. Nora persuades Nick to take the case after the fugitive, Gilbert Wynant sends him a request to investigate the case. Reluctantly, Nick takes Asta and goes prowling in the dark. He uncovers an unidentified body in Wynant's laboratory. Meantime, the police and the press believe that Wynant has killed three people. The use of modern technology at the time helps Nick to find the answer that he is looking for but nobody else knows. Nick and Nora are a couple to watch.

    "The Thin Man" (1934) is one of the best films ever made....a great stage play made into a great movie. It was originally a stage play written by Dashiell Hammett, and no doubt retained most of Hammett's great writing when Albert Hackett and his then young wife, Frances Goodrich turned the play into a movie script. This was the first important movie where the lead romantic couple exchange in banter and "repartee" which reflected the acceptance (finally) in the 1930's the "the independent woman" (even married independent women!) in USA culture, less than two decades after women finally "got the vote." Major players and minor supporting actors in "The Thin Man" (1934) are all lovable, and that includes the villain, lawyer Herbert MacCauley, marvelously portrayed by long time movie character actor of note, Porter Hall. The story is a "Whodunit" and the audience never guesses the real culprit until the penultimate scene (the next to the last scene) when hero detective, Nick Charles (played to perfection by William Powell), hosts a grand dinner for half a dozen likely suspects (and police in attendance, too, both as tuxedo clad guests and also as waiter staffers!), and fingers the guilty guy. Many people opine that the best final scene in any movie is the one in Casablanca (1943) where Humphrey Bogart (playing "Rick Blaine") tells Claude Rains (playing the French "Prefect Of Police" who just helped Bogart and now becomes a fugitive along with Bogart) tells his new friend, and fellow accomplice, "Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship." But I think "The Thin Man" (1934) has the best final scene of all. It's a rapid fire "end of the film" portrait of the Nick and Nora Charles married couple about to get to bed in a moving railroad train private room, this in a movie which shows the two alone together in bedrooms before with nothing sexy at all happening between them. The audience sees unexpected beginnings of "married love," and the camera switches instantly to the nighttime train entering a tunnel with the "San Francisco, Here I Come" tune played brightly and zestfully. Alfred Hitchcock used the same "affectionate couple (Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint) about to get into bed together on a train, then quick switch to train entering a tunnel" at the end of "North By Northwest" (1959), but that movie ending didn't have "San Francisco, Here I Come" music along with it, and that makes all the difference! ---------------------- Written by David R.

    There wasn't any film noir at the time. There were a few early notions formed in Weimar Germany about dazed minds succumbing to control of storymakers. The femme fatale was beginning to get shape as a force in the story. And then there was the detective film; each studio run its own highly successful series, each one influenced by the one before. Fox had Charlie Chan, and less famously Peter Lorre's Mr. Moto. Monogram responded with the Chinese Mr. Wong. RKO had Withers. Warners run the Perry Mason cycle. These were more or less debonair sleuths, gentle, delicate beings, after the stereotypical notion for Sherlock Holmes. And of course The Thin Man, I believe six films in total pairing William Powell with Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, dilettantes and sleuths, also openly quoting Holmes. The game here is that the detective plot is incidental to the story and only the hook that lets all the other effects sink in. The screwball comedy, the sexual innuendo, the fashions, the wit as dry as the martinis. You may piece something together but quite apart from what sleuthing is going on; no one is really sure if the sleuth is on the case or not, including him, the clues and suspects are laid out on his living-room in the middle of a party and they're merely a lot of noise that gets in the way of sipping one martini after another. Our introduction to Nick is where he's showing waiters how to shake cocktails, foreshadowing handling of the case to us. Naturally he pieces everything together in the final explanatory denouement; a dinner party with all the suspects invited, one of them the killer. No device is more contrived these days, in part because it used to work so well. You didn't have to puzzle about any of this, or fates in control of the thing, because there were none. All you had to do was kick back and sip at all the extraordinary chintz of the sleuthing. This type of film culminates in the Maltese Falcon, incidentally also adapted from Hammett and the shift towards noir proper. The more elaborate trick there was that all the suspects were aware of a ridiculous detective film going on, and constantly switched between elated viewers and mischievous storymakers. Sam Spade's main assets were great acting and making up stories. The only mischief going on here is between Nick and Nora, who constantly wink at each other about sex they're not having - until the end. Their chemistry sizzles in a way that deep love does.

    The Thin Man (1934) was directed by W.S. Van Dyke. This picture has an extremely high IMDb weighted average of 8.1. I had great hopes for this film, which we saw at a New Year's eve showing at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman House in Rochester. I'm sorry to report that the film didn't work for me at any level. William Powell and Myrna Loy play Nick and Nora Charles. He's a former detective, she's an heiress. They are rich, glamorous, and very, very sophisticated. Powell and Loy were wildly popular in these roles, and reprised them again and again. Powell more or less looks the part, but I think Loy was miscast. She looks and acts like one of the bright, snappy, working-class women in a screwball comedy. She doesn't look or act like an heiress. A second problem I had with the film was the unending focus on alcohol consumption. Getting and being drunk was far more acceptable in society then than it is now. Even so, the film really wasn't about mystery or romance--it was about drinking. People are endlessly talking about drinking, or they're drinking, or they're holding icepacks to their heads on the morning after. Powell acts half-drunk for most of the film. (For the rest of the film he acts drunk.) I just don't find that entertaining. For me, the highlight of the evening happened before the film. The Eastman House volunteer who presented the film came dressed in a long, slinky, 1930's-style gown. She gave a witty, intelligent talk. This woman had the physical and mental attributes that would have made her a perfect Nora Charles. It's too bad that her role ended when the lights in the theater dimmed. P.S. I rarely post negative reviews of films that other IMDb reviewers have liked. That's not because I'm timid, but rather because if others liked them, I usually like them too. However, on the rare occasion when I've criticized a popular film, I've been sent some abusive personal comments. If you disagree with me, I'm happy to have you tell me so. Maybe I'll learn why other people think this film is so good. However, please don't use the opportunity to comment on my parentage, my species, or the depth of my mental inadequacies. Thanks, Red-125

    The Thin Man is directed by W.S Van Dyke,produced by Hunt Stromberg,with a screenplay written by Albert Hackett(based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett)and stars William Powell,Myrna Loy,Maureen O'Sullivan and Cesar Romero. Powell and Loy's chemistry in the film Manhattan Melodrama(1934)was so impressive that Van Dyke made sure they starred in his next film The Thin Man.It is in the Thin Man that they really shine together,both perfectly in tune with one another creating one of the most memorable screen marriages ever seen.In their hands Nick and Nora become a unique couple who not only love each other,they like each other and treat each other as complete equals. Former Private Detective Nick Charles(William Powell)returns home to New York with his new wife Nora(Myrna Loy)and the couples adorable dog Asta.Nick's approached by an old friend Dorothy Wynant(Maureen O'Sullivan)who's father Clyde(Edward Ellis)is the prime suspect in the murder of her Dorothy's stepmother.She doesn't believe the charge for a second,not just for personal intuition but for the fact her father has been missing for a while.She asks Nick to look for him and he eventually agrees to take on the case.Aided by Nora Nick sinks his teeth into the mystery of the Thin Man and at an unforgettable dinner party reveals both who the real murderer is and the fate of the missing man. One of the most discussed aspects of this film is Nick and Nora's constant drinking.Powell's laconic Nick may at times seem like an alcoholic but he is never out of control and slips back and forth between giddy charmer and active,sober sleuth with such ease your never quite sure if his drinking is all an act.In Loy's case she makes Nora's drinking seem both sophisticated and simply a natural extension of this elegant young woman's personality. The amount of booze consumed in the film truly reaches almost farcical levels at times(perhaps a nod to the Great Depression,now it's over lets live the good life).Despite that it somehow fits as an almost necessary element to the story(it's presence adds greatly to the films comedy). It's pointless watching this for the story,it's convoluted and quite frankly distracts from the relationship between Nick and Nora.It is they and not the plot,who are the films strongest point.The snappy banter between the two is expertly written,with lines often not striking the audience as funny until several seconds after they are spoken.The deep affection Nick has for Nora often doesn't require words, it's present simply in the looks the couple share,and she in turn adores him and wants to share in his work,even when danger threatens. Powell and Loy starred in several sequels and The Thin Man was obviously the inspiration for TV series such as Hart To Hart.Witty,exciting and complex you should seek out the Thin Man as soon as possible,you won't be disappointed.

    THE THIN MAN (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1934), directed by W.S. Van Dyke, from the novel by Dashiell Hammett, is a classic mystery-comedy that helped establish the careers of both its leading performers, William Powell and Myrna Loy, Powell especially, in a performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination. There have been mystery-comedies prior to this, A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT (Allied, 1933) with Ginger Rogers and Lyle Talbot as rival news reporters that immediately comes to mind, but THE THIN MAN stands in a class by itself. With the plot set in New York City at the start of the Christmas season, the ten minute prologue begins with Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), an absent-minded inventor, who discovers that his secretary, Julia Wolfe (Natalie Moorehead), with whom he has been carrying on a romancer, has stolen $50,000 worth of government bonds he's been saving for the upcoming wedding of his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan) to Andrew (Henry Wadsworth). Wynant confronts Julia with his accusations, and after learning the truth, he angrily walks out of the apartment down the dark streets alone. The story gets underway as Wynant's ex-wife, Mimi (Minna Gombell), in desperate need of money, comes to visit Julia to learn of Wynant's whereabouts. After entering the apartment, she finds her dead. Before the police are called, Mimi takes something from Julia's hand belonging to Wynant, and withholds the item as possible evidence. As for Dorothy, she suspects something terribly wrong when her father, away on a secret trip unknown even to his personal attorney, Herbert McCauley (Porter Hall), hasn't returned in time for the wedding. She soon takes her worries to Nick Charles (William Powell), a friend of the family having a time of his life drinking cocktails in a speakeasy. Nick, a former detective visiting from San Francisco with his wealthy wife, Nora (Myrna Loy), is asked to investigate. At first Nick declines, but after three additional murders take place, linking it all to gray-haired thin man, Wynant, now missing for three months, Nick, at Nora's urging, comes out of his four years of carefree living to look into the case. Along with Lieutenant John Guild (Nat Pendleton) and his dog, Asta, Nick stumbles upon some clues while investigating in Wynant's workshop, to surprising and unexpected results. Suspects in question include William Henry as Wynant's studious intellectual son, Gilbert; Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgensen, a lazy loafer living off Mimi; and Julia's gangster acquaintances played by Edward Brophy (Joe Morelli); and Harold Huber (Nunheimer), the latter being murder victim number three. Then there's Bert Roach being the overgrown crybaby guest at the Christmas Eve party wanting to use Nick's phone to call his "maw" long distance. The success or failure for any motion picture relies simply on fine scripting (Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich) and perfect casting. THE THIN MAN succeeds on those counts and chemistry by Powell and Loy. Having already some detective experience to his name, that of Philo Vance on three separate occasions, "The Canary Murder Case" 1929); "The Benson Murder Case" (1930 and "The Kennel Murder Case" (1933), Powell's Nick Charles, unlike any other detective commonly found in motion picture mysteries, is very much witty, down to earth, and of course, married. Rather than typically presenting a detective sleuthing with a male counterpart as comedy relief, a gal reporter, or very much alone, Nick Charles is assisted by Asta, his wire-haired fox terrier. Observant and clever with his deductions, Nick Charles is also quick with his responses, a fondness for liquor and fun at parties. His friends are usually ex-cons whom he's "sent up the river,"holding no grudge against him. Myrna Loy has found her true character in Nora Charles. Breaking away from the stereotype bossy spouse, she accepts her husband for what and whom he is, and equals with his enjoyment of fun and mystery combined. Great scene captures her sitting on the couch gowned in fur coat calmly watching her husband being a little boy at heart playing with the sling shot he's gotten for Christmas, shooting away the ornaments hanging on the Christmas tree one by one. As much as Nora would prefer sleuthing with him during his investigations, she seldom gets that chance. The climatic finish where Nick summons all connected with the case at the dinner gathering is well constructed in both humor and suspense. The success of THE THIN MAN not only brought forth many imitations, but five additional sequels starring Powell and Loy, along with the basis of a 1957-59 television series starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk, but nothing to compare with the 1934 original, being the most famous and revived of all the "Thin Man" presentations combined. Distributed to video cassette as early as the 1980s by MGM Home Video enclosed in plastic clam shells, cable television presentations on the Disney Channel's "Best of Hollywood" in the 1990s, Turner Classic Movies from 1994 onward, and finally DVD where this and others continue to acquire both a new audience along with those who know who the killer is but to just simply want to watch over and over again in the manner of Nick and Nora Charles, just for the fun of it.

    The Thin Man is directed by W. S. Van Dyke and co-written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. It is based on the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name. Starring are William Powell and Myrna Loy, with support coming from Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Porter Hall and Skippy as Astra the dog. William Axt scores the music and James Wong Howe is the cinematographer. Plot finds Powell and Loy as married couple, Nick and Nora Charles, he is a retired detective, she a good time heiress. Planning to finally settle down, their life is upturned when Nick is called back into detective work due to a friend's disappearance and the possibility he was also involved in a murder. Murder, malarkey and mirth are about to become the order of the day. It was the big surprise hit of 1934. Afforded only a tiny budget because studio head honcho Louis B. Mayer thought it was dud material, and ordered to be completed in under three weeks time, film made stars out of Powell and Loy and coined an impressive $2 million at the box office. Also birthing a franchise (5 film sequels and a radio and television series would follow), it's a film that has irresistible charm leaping out from every frame. It's easy to see even now why a mid 1930's audience could take so warmly to such an appealing motion picture. From the off the film was in good hands, Dyke (One-Take Woody as he was sometimes known) was an unfussy director with a keen eye for pacing and casting, both of which are things that shine through in this production. There's also considerable talent in the writing, both in the source material and with the script writers. Hammett based his witty bantering couple on himself and his relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman, this was ideal material for Hackett and Goodrich, themselves a happily married couple fondly thought of in the cut and thrust world of Hollywood. As a couple they would go on to write It's a Wonderful Life for Frank Capra and win the Pulitzer Prize for their play The Diary of Anne Frank. It stands out as a film of note because it successfully marries a murder mystery story with a screwball comedy spin, this was something new and exciting. While the believable relationship between Powell and Loy was also a breath of fresh air; a married couple deeply in love, devoted, funny, boozey and bouncing off of each other with witty repartee. It can never be overstated just how good Powell and Loy are here, true enough they are given an absolutely zinging script to work from, but the level of comedy, both in visual ticks and delivery of lines, is extraordinarily high. Small budget and a small shoot, but everything else about The Thin Man is big. Big laughs, big mystery and big love, all bundled up into a joyous bit of classic cinema. 9/10

    I saw this after I had seen some of the sequels and was a bit surprised at the very dark storyline surrounding the more light material involved with solving the mystery. In the first scene we see The Thin Man who is a scientist involved in some highly suspect work that eventually gets him killed. We see that he is not a very sympathetic individual, but he does have a soft side when it comes to his daughter. There is some evidence that he is also capable of slapping women around, as indicated in a later scene with his mistress. The first half hour's darkness works surprisingly well with the more lighter material. The sequels were more interested in the shenanigans of Nick and Nora, but here they seem more involved with the sad characters and Nick's one-liners are not as pronounced as the would be in the sequels. Nick and Nora are actually more supporting characters and that may be a bit disappointing. Furtunately, there are many comic highlights involving the geeky son, the inept police and the shrill ex-wife of the scientist. The motive of the murderer is a bit underdeveloped and the ending is a bit of a letdown. It is always the least likely suspect but watch closely and you can actually figure it out pretty quickly. The movie's pace is also a bit slower than its sequels' but that is because of the relatively new adjustment to sound and not a fault of the actors. There is almost no underscoring and that gives it a sort of creepy vibe in the dramatic scenes. Good first movie but the two first sequels were a bit more funny.

    This is the start of an excellent series of Thin Man movies with William Powell and Myrna Loy as the high class couple Nick and Nora Charles, with their dog Asta. Nick is a "retired" cop who has married the rich socialite Nora. Nick is always getting involved in cases the cops can't seem to solve and of course he does solve them. Usually using his old contacts with his old underworld buddies that he had given breaks to over the years. The repartee between the couple is pretty funny at times and Asta is a well trained dog who comes across as cowardly. Both of the Charles's like to drink and party some, my kind of people!! Most of action is fairly low keyed and I think is done to make the audience think.

    This film was based on one book, and because it was so popular it was turned into a six film series, with the lead stars returning for all of them, and this the first film is the one that appeared in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was most interested to watch it. Basically retired detective Nick Charles (Oscar nominated William Powell) and his wife Nora (Myrna Loy) are trying to settle down, but a friend of his, Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), the "thin man" of the title, disappears and may be involved in a murder, so he is pulled back into action to investigate. The man who has vanished is the prime suspect to the murder of his former secretary and girlfriend Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead) as all the evidence points to him, but the one who doesn't believe he has any involvement is his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan), and is the one who convinces the former private eye to take the case. This amuses his wife, but Nick does stumble onto some clues and pieces together the facts for an intense investigation, and he eventually comes to conclude who the murderer really is, but he is not telling anybody his findings until an event he is putting on. All the guests he is inviting are the ones he believes are capable of murder, but he knows only one really did the crime, and a classic dinner party scene, and with explanations of each person's involvement in the recent events, including the skeleton body of missing Mynant found who was killed for his money. Also starring Nat Pendleton as Inspector John Guild , Minna Gombell as Mimi Wynant, Porter Hall as Herbert MacCaulay, Henry Wadsworth as Tommy, William Henry as Gilbert Wynant, Harold Huber as Arthur Nunheim, Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgenson, Edward Brophy as Joe Morelli and Cyril Thornton as Tanner. Powell gives a leading performance with his clever theorising and charming wit, Loy is really likable as his wife who is by his side throughout, together they make a great duo, so it is no wonder that sequels followed, if you like mystery mixed with some good laughs then this good entertainment, a fun classic detective comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for W.S. Van Dyke, Best Picture and Best Writing, Adaptation. It was number 32 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    "The Thin Man" is a smart, sophisticated, urban whodunit staged with Spartan style and little nonsense by W.S. Van Dyke who went on to helm the first three entries in the six film franchise. This was not the first time that mustached William Powell either played a detective or paired up with Myrna Loy. They co-starred in several movies before and after "The Thin Man" series, such "Manhattan Melodrama," "The Great Ziegfeld," "Libeled Lady," "Double Wedding," "Love Crazy," "I Love You Again," and "Evelyn Prentice." This clever mystery thriller unfolds in three-acts. The suspects and the situation are laid out in crisp, expository fashion, and then we meet Nick & Nora Charles who become involved in the mystery. It seems our hero knew one of the suspects. This association draws him into the investigation. All this is capped off with a huge party that Nick throws for the suspects to smoke out the murderer. A variety of characters make up the cast. Remember, M-G-M produced this mystery back in 1934, when Hollywood couldn't depict violence with any realistic detail. As it is, "The Thin Man" looks like a drinking man's champ. Our hero guzzles and so do many others. Nick has guzzled six martinis by the time his wife joins him in the bar. This 91-minute melodrama qualifies as a Christmas movie because it occurs during the holiday season. The dialogue is often snappy, especially the being "shot five times in the tabloids." The secretary of an eccentric scientist, Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead of "The King Murder"), has been murdered. The eccentric scientist, Gilbert Wynant (William Henry of "Rubber Racketeers"), vanishes afterward without a trace. Earlier, Wynant's wife Mimi (Minna Gombell of "High Sierra") divorced him because of a fling with Ms. Wolf. Worst, the conniving secretary was up to no good under Wynant's very nose. Quietly enough, Julia had been embezzling money; she cashed in two bonds amounting to $50-thousand. Wynant catches her with a gangster, Morelli (Edward Brophy), and they quarrel about the kind of men that she ahs been seeing. Gilbert Wynant is the jealous type. Myrna Loy's entrance in the action is funny. Asta literally drags her with packages piled up in her arms. Later, Wynant's attorney Herbert MacCaulay (Porter Hall of "His Girl Friday"), inquires if Nick is sleuthing for Wynant's ex-wife. Nick informs MacCaulay he gave up being a private eye four years ago. "My wife's father died and left her a narrow gauge railway, and a lumber mill, and several other things. I'm taking care of them." When they have this conversation, Wynant has been missing for three months. The first entry in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's "Thin Man" franchise, "The Thin Man," takes about twenty minutes before Nick Charles (William Powell) makes his entrance. He is teaching bartenders how to mix various alcoholic beverages. "You see, the important thing is the rhythm. You should always have rhythm in your shaking. "A Manhattan you shake to a fox trot. A Bronx to a two-step time. A dry martini you always shake to waltzes." When he completes this elaboration lecture, Nick takes the drink that he prepared so fastidiously and sips it. Wynant's daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan of "Tarzan of the Apes") walks up to him and informs him that she remembers him from a case. Dorothy is searching for her father. Mimi goes to see Julia Wolf about getting more money. Morelli (Edward Brophy of "All Through the Night") learns about Julia's murder and barges into Nick's apartment. Morelli tries to kill Nick, and the authorities are suspicious about our hero. The police confiscate an unregistered gun and promise to ask him more questions. Nick Charles hasn't worked on a case as a private eye for four years. Since he has married Mrs. Charles, he handles his wife's considerable affairs. Eventually, Inspector John Guild (Nat Pendleton of "Trapped by Television") convinces Nick to work with them. Nora persuades Nick to take the case after the fugitive, Gilbert Wynant sends him a request to investigate the case. Reluctantly, Nick takes Asta and goes prowling in the dark. He uncovers an unidentified body in Wynant's laboratory. Meantime, the police and the press believe that Wynant has killed three people. The use of modern technology at the time helps Nick to find the answer that he is looking for but nobody else knows. Nick and Nora are a couple to watch.

    "The Thin Man" (1934) is one of the best films ever made....a great stage play made into a great movie. It was originally a stage play written by Dashiell Hammett, and no doubt retained most of Hammett's great writing when Albert Hackett and his then young wife, Frances Goodrich turned the play into a movie script. This was the first important movie where the lead romantic couple exchange in banter and "repartee" which reflected the acceptance (finally) in the 1930's the "the independent woman" (even married independent women!) in USA culture, less than two decades after women finally "got the vote." Major players and minor supporting actors in "The Thin Man" (1934) are all lovable, and that includes the villain, lawyer Herbert MacCauley, marvelously portrayed by long time movie character actor of note, Porter Hall. The story is a "Whodunit" and the audience never guesses the real culprit until the penultimate scene (the next to the last scene) when hero detective, Nick Charles (played to perfection by William Powell), hosts a grand dinner for half a dozen likely suspects (and police in attendance, too, both as tuxedo clad guests and also as waiter staffers!), and fingers the guilty guy. Many people opine that the best final scene in any movie is the one in Casablanca (1943) where Humphrey Bogart (playing "Rick Blaine") tells Claude Rains (playing the French "Prefect Of Police" who just helped Bogart and now becomes a fugitive along with Bogart) tells his new friend, and fellow accomplice, "Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship." But I think "The Thin Man" (1934) has the best final scene of all. It's a rapid fire "end of the film" portrait of the Nick and Nora Charles married couple about to get to bed in a moving railroad train private room, this in a movie which shows the two alone together in bedrooms before with nothing sexy at all happening between them. The audience sees unexpected beginnings of "married love," and the camera switches instantly to the nighttime train entering a tunnel with the "San Francisco, Here I Come" tune played brightly and zestfully. Alfred Hitchcock used the same "affectionate couple (Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint) about to get into bed together on a train, then quick switch to train entering a tunnel" at the end of "North By Northwest" (1959), but that movie ending didn't have "San Francisco, Here I Come" music along with it, and that makes all the difference! ---------------------- Written by David R.

    There wasn't any film noir at the time. There were a few early notions formed in Weimar Germany about dazed minds succumbing to control of storymakers. The femme fatale was beginning to get shape as a force in the story. And then there was the detective film; each studio run its own highly successful series, each one influenced by the one before. Fox had Charlie Chan, and less famously Peter Lorre's Mr. Moto. Monogram responded with the Chinese Mr. Wong. RKO had Withers. Warners run the Perry Mason cycle. These were more or less debonair sleuths, gentle, delicate beings, after the stereotypical notion for Sherlock Holmes. And of course The Thin Man, I believe six films in total pairing William Powell with Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, dilettantes and sleuths, also openly quoting Holmes. The game here is that the detective plot is incidental to the story and only the hook that lets all the other effects sink in. The screwball comedy, the sexual innuendo, the fashions, the wit as dry as the martinis. You may piece something together but quite apart from what sleuthing is going on; no one is really sure if the sleuth is on the case or not, including him, the clues and suspects are laid out on his living-room in the middle of a party and they're merely a lot of noise that gets in the way of sipping one martini after another. Our introduction to Nick is where he's showing waiters how to shake cocktails, foreshadowing handling of the case to us. Naturally he pieces everything together in the final explanatory denouement; a dinner party with all the suspects invited, one of them the killer. No device is more contrived these days, in part because it used to work so well. You didn't have to puzzle about any of this, or fates in control of the thing, because there were none. All you had to do was kick back and sip at all the extraordinary chintz of the sleuthing. This type of film culminates in the Maltese Falcon, incidentally also adapted from Hammett and the shift towards noir proper. The more elaborate trick there was that all the suspects were aware of a ridiculous detective film going on, and constantly switched between elated viewers and mischievous storymakers. Sam Spade's main assets were great acting and making up stories. The only mischief going on here is between Nick and Nora, who constantly wink at each other about sex they're not having - until the end. Their chemistry sizzles in a way that deep love does.

    The Thin Man (1934) was directed by W.S. Van Dyke. This picture has an extremely high IMDb weighted average of 8.1. I had great hopes for this film, which we saw at a New Year's eve showing at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman House in Rochester. I'm sorry to report that the film didn't work for me at any level. William Powell and Myrna Loy play Nick and Nora Charles. He's a former detective, she's an heiress. They are rich, glamorous, and very, very sophisticated. Powell and Loy were wildly popular in these roles, and reprised them again and again. Powell more or less looks the part, but I think Loy was miscast. She looks and acts like one of the bright, snappy, working-class women in a screwball comedy. She doesn't look or act like an heiress. A second problem I had with the film was the unending focus on alcohol consumption. Getting and being drunk was far more acceptable in society then than it is now. Even so, the film really wasn't about mystery or romance--it was about drinking. People are endlessly talking about drinking, or they're drinking, or they're holding icepacks to their heads on the morning after. Powell acts half-drunk for most of the film. (For the rest of the film he acts drunk.) I just don't find that entertaining. For me, the highlight of the evening happened before the film. The Eastman House volunteer who presented the film came dressed in a long, slinky, 1930's-style gown. She gave a witty, intelligent talk. This woman had the physical and mental attributes that would have made her a perfect Nora Charles. It's too bad that her role ended when the lights in the theater dimmed. P.S. I rarely post negative reviews of films that other IMDb reviewers have liked. That's not because I'm timid, but rather because if others liked them, I usually like them too. However, on the rare occasion when I've criticized a popular film, I've been sent some abusive personal comments. If you disagree with me, I'm happy to have you tell me so. Maybe I'll learn why other people think this film is so good. However, please don't use the opportunity to comment on my parentage, my species, or the depth of my mental inadequacies. Thanks, Red-125

Powell and Loy's chemistry in the film Manhattan Melodrama(1934)was so impressive that Van Dyke made sure they starred in his next film The Thin Man.It is in the Thin Man that they really shine together,both perfectly in tune with one another creating one of the most memorable screen marriages ever seen.In their hands Nick and Nora become a unique couple who not only love each other,they like each other and treat each other as complete equals. Former Private Detective Nick Charles(William Powell)returns home to New York with his new wife Nora(Myrna Loy)and the couples adorable dog Asta.Nick's approached by an old friend Dorothy Wynant(Maureen O'Sullivan)who's father Clyde(Edward Ellis)is the prime suspect in the murder of her Dorothy's stepmother.She doesn't believe the charge for a second,not just for personal intuition but for the fact her father has been missing for a while.She asks Nick to look for him and he eventually agrees to take on the case.Aided by Nora Nick sinks his teeth into the mystery of the Thin Man and at an unforgettable dinner party reveals both who the real murderer is and the fate of the missing man. One of the most discussed aspects of this film is Nick and Nora's constant drinking.Powell's laconic Nick may at times seem like an alcoholic but he is never out of control and slips back and forth between giddy charmer and active,sober sleuth with such ease your never quite sure if his drinking is all an act.In Loy's case she makes Nora's drinking seem both sophisticated and simply a natural extension of this elegant young woman's personality. The amount of booze consumed in the film truly reaches almost farcical levels at times(perhaps a nod to the Great Depression,now it's over lets live the good life).Despite that it somehow fits as an almost necessary element to the story(it's presence adds greatly to the films comedy). It's pointless watching this for the story,it's convoluted and quite frankly distracts from the relationship between Nick and Nora.It is they and not the plot,who are the films strongest point.The snappy banter between the two is expertly written,with lines often not striking the audience as funny until several seconds after they are spoken.The deep affection Nick has for Nora often doesn't require words, it's present simply in the looks the couple share,and she in turn adores him and wants to share in his work,even when danger threatens. Powell and Loy starred in several sequels and The Thin Man was obviously the inspiration for TV series such as Hart To Hart.Witty,exciting and complex you should seek out the Thin Man as soon as possible,you won't be disappointed.

    THE THIN MAN (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1934), directed by W.S. Van Dyke, from the novel by Dashiell Hammett, is a classic mystery-comedy that helped establish the careers of both its leading performers, William Powell and Myrna Loy, Powell especially, in a performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination. There have been mystery-comedies prior to this, A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT (Allied, 1933) with Ginger Rogers and Lyle Talbot as rival news reporters that immediately comes to mind, but THE THIN MAN stands in a class by itself. With the plot set in New York City at the start of the Christmas season, the ten minute prologue begins with Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), an absent-minded inventor, who discovers that his secretary, Julia Wolfe (Natalie Moorehead), with whom he has been carrying on a romancer, has stolen $50,000 worth of government bonds he's been saving for the upcoming wedding of his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan) to Andrew (Henry Wadsworth). Wynant confronts Julia with his accusations, and after learning the truth, he angrily walks out of the apartment down the dark streets alone. The story gets underway as Wynant's ex-wife, Mimi (Minna Gombell), in desperate need of money, comes to visit Julia to learn of Wynant's whereabouts. After entering the apartment, she finds her dead. Before the police are called, Mimi takes something from Julia's hand belonging to Wynant, and withholds the item as possible evidence. As for Dorothy, she suspects something terribly wrong when her father, away on a secret trip unknown even to his personal attorney, Herbert McCauley (Porter Hall), hasn't returned in time for the wedding. She soon takes her worries to Nick Charles (William Powell), a friend of the family having a time of his life drinking cocktails in a speakeasy. Nick, a former detective visiting from San Francisco with his wealthy wife, Nora (Myrna Loy), is asked to investigate. At first Nick declines, but after three additional murders take place, linking it all to gray-haired thin man, Wynant, now missing for three months, Nick, at Nora's urging, comes out of his four years of carefree living to look into the case. Along with Lieutenant John Guild (Nat Pendleton) and his dog, Asta, Nick stumbles upon some clues while investigating in Wynant's workshop, to surprising and unexpected results. Suspects in question include William Henry as Wynant's studious intellectual son, Gilbert; Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgensen, a lazy loafer living off Mimi; and Julia's gangster acquaintances played by Edward Brophy (Joe Morelli); and Harold Huber (Nunheimer), the latter being murder victim number three. Then there's Bert Roach being the overgrown crybaby guest at the Christmas Eve party wanting to use Nick's phone to call his "maw" long distance. The success or failure for any motion picture relies simply on fine scripting (Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich) and perfect casting. THE THIN MAN succeeds on those counts and chemistry by Powell and Loy. Having already some detective experience to his name, that of Philo Vance on three separate occasions, "The Canary Murder Case" 1929); "The Benson Murder Case" (1930 and "The Kennel Murder Case" (1933), Powell's Nick Charles, unlike any other detective commonly found in motion picture mysteries, is very much witty, down to earth, and of course, married. Rather than typically presenting a detective sleuthing with a male counterpart as comedy relief, a gal reporter, or very much alone, Nick Charles is assisted by Asta, his wire-haired fox terrier. Observant and clever with his deductions, Nick Charles is also quick with his responses, a fondness for liquor and fun at parties. His friends are usually ex-cons whom he's "sent up the river,"holding no grudge against him. Myrna Loy has found her true character in Nora Charles. Breaking away from the stereotype bossy spouse, she accepts her husband for what and whom he is, and equals with his enjoyment of fun and mystery combined. Great scene captures her sitting on the couch gowned in fur coat calmly watching her husband being a little boy at heart playing with the sling shot he's gotten for Christmas, shooting away the ornaments hanging on the Christmas tree one by one. As much as Nora would prefer sleuthing with him during his investigations, she seldom gets that chance. The climatic finish where Nick summons all connected with the case at the dinner gathering is well constructed in both humor and suspense. The success of THE THIN MAN not only brought forth many imitations, but five additional sequels starring Powell and Loy, along with the basis of a 1957-59 television series starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk, but nothing to compare with the 1934 original, being the most famous and revived of all the "Thin Man" presentations combined. Distributed to video cassette as early as the 1980s by MGM Home Video enclosed in plastic clam shells, cable television presentations on the Disney Channel's "Best of Hollywood" in the 1990s, Turner Classic Movies from 1994 onward, and finally DVD where this and others continue to acquire both a new audience along with those who know who the killer is but to just simply want to watch over and over again in the manner of Nick and Nora Charles, just for the fun of it.

    The Thin Man is directed by W. S. Van Dyke and co-written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. It is based on the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name. Starring are William Powell and Myrna Loy, with support coming from Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Porter Hall and Skippy as Astra the dog. William Axt scores the music and James Wong Howe is the cinematographer. Plot finds Powell and Loy as married couple, Nick and Nora Charles, he is a retired detective, she a good time heiress. Planning to finally settle down, their life is upturned when Nick is called back into detective work due to a friend's disappearance and the possibility he was also involved in a murder. Murder, malarkey and mirth are about to become the order of the day. It was the big surprise hit of 1934. Afforded only a tiny budget because studio head honcho Louis B. Mayer thought it was dud material, and ordered to be completed in under three weeks time, film made stars out of Powell and Loy and coined an impressive $2 million at the box office. Also birthing a franchise (5 film sequels and a radio and television series would follow), it's a film that has irresistible charm leaping out from every frame. It's easy to see even now why a mid 1930's audience could take so warmly to such an appealing motion picture. From the off the film was in good hands, Dyke (One-Take Woody as he was sometimes known) was an unfussy director with a keen eye for pacing and casting, both of which are things that shine through in this production. There's also considerable talent in the writing, both in the source material and with the script writers. Hammett based his witty bantering couple on himself and his relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman, this was ideal material for Hackett and Goodrich, themselves a happily married couple fondly thought of in the cut and thrust world of Hollywood. As a couple they would go on to write It's a Wonderful Life for Frank Capra and win the Pulitzer Prize for their play The Diary of Anne Frank. It stands out as a film of note because it successfully marries a murder mystery story with a screwball comedy spin, this was something new and exciting. While the believable relationship between Powell and Loy was also a breath of fresh air; a married couple deeply in love, devoted, funny, boozey and bouncing off of each other with witty repartee. It can never be overstated just how good Powell and Loy are here, true enough they are given an absolutely zinging script to work from, but the level of comedy, both in visual ticks and delivery of lines, is extraordinarily high. Small budget and a small shoot, but everything else about The Thin Man is big. Big laughs, big mystery and big love, all bundled up into a joyous bit of classic cinema. 9/10

    I saw this after I had seen some of the sequels and was a bit surprised at the very dark storyline surrounding the more light material involved with solving the mystery. In the first scene we see The Thin Man who is a scientist involved in some highly suspect work that eventually gets him killed. We see that he is not a very sympathetic individual, but he does have a soft side when it comes to his daughter. There is some evidence that he is also capable of slapping women around, as indicated in a later scene with his mistress. The first half hour's darkness works surprisingly well with the more lighter material. The sequels were more interested in the shenanigans of Nick and Nora, but here they seem more involved with the sad characters and Nick's one-liners are not as pronounced as the would be in the sequels. Nick and Nora are actually more supporting characters and that may be a bit disappointing. Furtunately, there are many comic highlights involving the geeky son, the inept police and the shrill ex-wife of the scientist. The motive of the murderer is a bit underdeveloped and the ending is a bit of a letdown. It is always the least likely suspect but watch closely and you can actually figure it out pretty quickly. The movie's pace is also a bit slower than its sequels' but that is because of the relatively new adjustment to sound and not a fault of the actors. There is almost no underscoring and that gives it a sort of creepy vibe in the dramatic scenes. Good first movie but the two first sequels were a bit more funny.

    This is the start of an excellent series of Thin Man movies with William Powell and Myrna Loy as the high class couple Nick and Nora Charles, with their dog Asta. Nick is a "retired" cop who has married the rich socialite Nora. Nick is always getting involved in cases the cops can't seem to solve and of course he does solve them. Usually using his old contacts with his old underworld buddies that he had given breaks to over the years. The repartee between the couple is pretty funny at times and Asta is a well trained dog who comes across as cowardly. Both of the Charles's like to drink and party some, my kind of people!! Most of action is fairly low keyed and I think is done to make the audience think.

    This film was based on one book, and because it was so popular it was turned into a six film series, with the lead stars returning for all of them, and this the first film is the one that appeared in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was most interested to watch it. Basically retired detective Nick Charles (Oscar nominated William Powell) and his wife Nora (Myrna Loy) are trying to settle down, but a friend of his, Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), the "thin man" of the title, disappears and may be involved in a murder, so he is pulled back into action to investigate. The man who has vanished is the prime suspect to the murder of his former secretary and girlfriend Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead) as all the evidence points to him, but the one who doesn't believe he has any involvement is his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan), and is the one who convinces the former private eye to take the case. This amuses his wife, but Nick does stumble onto some clues and pieces together the facts for an intense investigation, and he eventually comes to conclude who the murderer really is, but he is not telling anybody his findings until an event he is putting on. All the guests he is inviting are the ones he believes are capable of murder, but he knows only one really did the crime, and a classic dinner party scene, and with explanations of each person's involvement in the recent events, including the skeleton body of missing Mynant found who was killed for his money. Also starring Nat Pendleton as Inspector John Guild , Minna Gombell as Mimi Wynant, Porter Hall as Herbert MacCaulay, Henry Wadsworth as Tommy, William Henry as Gilbert Wynant, Harold Huber as Arthur Nunheim, Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgenson, Edward Brophy as Joe Morelli and Cyril Thornton as Tanner. Powell gives a leading performance with his clever theorising and charming wit, Loy is really likable as his wife who is by his side throughout, together they make a great duo, so it is no wonder that sequels followed, if you like mystery mixed with some good laughs then this good entertainment, a fun classic detective comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for W.S. Van Dyke, Best Picture and Best Writing, Adaptation. It was number 32 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    "The Thin Man" is a smart, sophisticated, urban whodunit staged with Spartan style and little nonsense by W.S. Van Dyke who went on to helm the first three entries in the six film franchise. This was not the first time that mustached William Powell either played a detective or paired up with Myrna Loy. They co-starred in several movies before and after "The Thin Man" series, such "Manhattan Melodrama," "The Great Ziegfeld," "Libeled Lady," "Double Wedding," "Love Crazy," "I Love You Again," and "Evelyn Prentice." This clever mystery thriller unfolds in three-acts. The suspects and the situation are laid out in crisp, expository fashion, and then we meet Nick & Nora Charles who become involved in the mystery. It seems our hero knew one of the suspects. This association draws him into the investigation. All this is capped off with a huge party that Nick throws for the suspects to smoke out the murderer. A variety of characters make up the cast. Remember, M-G-M produced this mystery back in 1934, when Hollywood couldn't depict violence with any realistic detail. As it is, "The Thin Man" looks like a drinking man's champ. Our hero guzzles and so do many others. Nick has guzzled six martinis by the time his wife joins him in the bar. This 91-minute melodrama qualifies as a Christmas movie because it occurs during the holiday season. The dialogue is often snappy, especially the being "shot five times in the tabloids." The secretary of an eccentric scientist, Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead of "The King Murder"), has been murdered. The eccentric scientist, Gilbert Wynant (William Henry of "Rubber Racketeers"), vanishes afterward without a trace. Earlier, Wynant's wife Mimi (Minna Gombell of "High Sierra") divorced him because of a fling with Ms. Wolf. Worst, the conniving secretary was up to no good under Wynant's very nose. Quietly enough, Julia had been embezzling money; she cashed in two bonds amounting to $50-thousand. Wynant catches her with a gangster, Morelli (Edward Brophy), and they quarrel about the kind of men that she ahs been seeing. Gilbert Wynant is the jealous type. Myrna Loy's entrance in the action is funny. Asta literally drags her with packages piled up in her arms. Later, Wynant's attorney Herbert MacCaulay (Porter Hall of "His Girl Friday"), inquires if Nick is sleuthing for Wynant's ex-wife. Nick informs MacCaulay he gave up being a private eye four years ago. "My wife's father died and left her a narrow gauge railway, and a lumber mill, and several other things. I'm taking care of them." When they have this conversation, Wynant has been missing for three months. The first entry in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's "Thin Man" franchise, "The Thin Man," takes about twenty minutes before Nick Charles (William Powell) makes his entrance. He is teaching bartenders how to mix various alcoholic beverages. "You see, the important thing is the rhythm. You should always have rhythm in your shaking. "A Manhattan you shake to a fox trot. A Bronx to a two-step time. A dry martini you always shake to waltzes." When he completes this elaboration lecture, Nick takes the drink that he prepared so fastidiously and sips it. Wynant's daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan of "Tarzan of the Apes") walks up to him and informs him that she remembers him from a case. Dorothy is searching for her father. Mimi goes to see Julia Wolf about getting more money. Morelli (Edward Brophy of "All Through the Night") learns about Julia's murder and barges into Nick's apartment. Morelli tries to kill Nick, and the authorities are suspicious about our hero. The police confiscate an unregistered gun and promise to ask him more questions. Nick Charles hasn't worked on a case as a private eye for four years. Since he has married Mrs. Charles, he handles his wife's considerable affairs. Eventually, Inspector John Guild (Nat Pendleton of "Trapped by Television") convinces Nick to work with them. Nora persuades Nick to take the case after the fugitive, Gilbert Wynant sends him a request to investigate the case. Reluctantly, Nick takes Asta and goes prowling in the dark. He uncovers an unidentified body in Wynant's laboratory. Meantime, the police and the press believe that Wynant has killed three people. The use of modern technology at the time helps Nick to find the answer that he is looking for but nobody else knows. Nick and Nora are a couple to watch.

    "The Thin Man" (1934) is one of the best films ever made....a great stage play made into a great movie. It was originally a stage play written by Dashiell Hammett, and no doubt retained most of Hammett's great writing when Albert Hackett and his then young wife, Frances Goodrich turned the play into a movie script. This was the first important movie where the lead romantic couple exchange in banter and "repartee" which reflected the acceptance (finally) in the 1930's the "the independent woman" (even married independent women!) in USA culture, less than two decades after women finally "got the vote." Major players and minor supporting actors in "The Thin Man" (1934) are all lovable, and that includes the villain, lawyer Herbert MacCauley, marvelously portrayed by long time movie character actor of note, Porter Hall. The story is a "Whodunit" and the audience never guesses the real culprit until the penultimate scene (the next to the last scene) when hero detective, Nick Charles (played to perfection by William Powell), hosts a grand dinner for half a dozen likely suspects (and police in attendance, too, both as tuxedo clad guests and also as waiter staffers!), and fingers the guilty guy. Many people opine that the best final scene in any movie is the one in Casablanca (1943) where Humphrey Bogart (playing "Rick Blaine") tells Claude Rains (playing the French "Prefect Of Police" who just helped Bogart and now becomes a fugitive along with Bogart) tells his new friend, and fellow accomplice, "Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship." But I think "The Thin Man" (1934) has the best final scene of all. It's a rapid fire "end of the film" portrait of the Nick and Nora Charles married couple about to get to bed in a moving railroad train private room, this in a movie which shows the two alone together in bedrooms before with nothing sexy at all happening between them. The audience sees unexpected beginnings of "married love," and the camera switches instantly to the nighttime train entering a tunnel with the "San Francisco, Here I Come" tune played brightly and zestfully. Alfred Hitchcock used the same "affectionate couple (Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint) about to get into bed together on a train, then quick switch to train entering a tunnel" at the end of "North By Northwest" (1959), but that movie ending didn't have "San Francisco, Here I Come" music along with it, and that makes all the difference! ---------------------- Written by David R.

    There wasn't any film noir at the time. There were a few early notions formed in Weimar Germany about dazed minds succumbing to control of storymakers. The femme fatale was beginning to get shape as a force in the story. And then there was the detective film; each studio run its own highly successful series, each one influenced by the one before. Fox had Charlie Chan, and less famously Peter Lorre's Mr. Moto. Monogram responded with the Chinese Mr. Wong. RKO had Withers. Warners run the Perry Mason cycle. These were more or less debonair sleuths, gentle, delicate beings, after the stereotypical notion for Sherlock Holmes. And of course The Thin Man, I believe six films in total pairing William Powell with Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, dilettantes and sleuths, also openly quoting Holmes. The game here is that the detective plot is incidental to the story and only the hook that lets all the other effects sink in. The screwball comedy, the sexual innuendo, the fashions, the wit as dry as the martinis. You may piece something together but quite apart from what sleuthing is going on; no one is really sure if the sleuth is on the case or not, including him, the clues and suspects are laid out on his living-room in the middle of a party and they're merely a lot of noise that gets in the way of sipping one martini after another. Our introduction to Nick is where he's showing waiters how to shake cocktails, foreshadowing handling of the case to us. Naturally he pieces everything together in the final explanatory denouement; a dinner party with all the suspects invited, one of them the killer. No device is more contrived these days, in part because it used to work so well. You didn't have to puzzle about any of this, or fates in control of the thing, because there were none. All you had to do was kick back and sip at all the extraordinary chintz of the sleuthing. This type of film culminates in the Maltese Falcon, incidentally also adapted from Hammett and the shift towards noir proper. The more elaborate trick there was that all the suspects were aware of a ridiculous detective film going on, and constantly switched between elated viewers and mischievous storymakers. Sam Spade's main assets were great acting and making up stories. The only mischief going on here is between Nick and Nora, who constantly wink at each other about sex they're not having - until the end. Their chemistry sizzles in a way that deep love does.

    The Thin Man (1934) was directed by W.S. Van Dyke. This picture has an extremely high IMDb weighted average of 8.1. I had great hopes for this film, which we saw at a New Year's eve showing at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman House in Rochester. I'm sorry to report that the film didn't work for me at any level. William Powell and Myrna Loy play Nick and Nora Charles. He's a former detective, she's an heiress. They are rich, glamorous, and very, very sophisticated. Powell and Loy were wildly popular in these roles, and reprised them again and again. Powell more or less looks the part, but I think Loy was miscast. She looks and acts like one of the bright, snappy, working-class women in a screwball comedy. She doesn't look or act like an heiress. A second problem I had with the film was the unending focus on alcohol consumption. Getting and being drunk was far more acceptable in society then than it is now. Even so, the film really wasn't about mystery or romance--it was about drinking. People are endlessly talking about drinking, or they're drinking, or they're holding icepacks to their heads on the morning after. Powell acts half-drunk for most of the film. (For the rest of the film he acts drunk.) I just don't find that entertaining. For me, the highlight of the evening happened before the film. The Eastman House volunteer who presented the film came dressed in a long, slinky, 1930's-style gown. She gave a witty, intelligent talk. This woman had the physical and mental attributes that would have made her a perfect Nora Charles. It's too bad that her role ended when the lights in the theater dimmed. P.S. I rarely post negative reviews of films that other IMDb reviewers have liked. That's not because I'm timid, but rather because if others liked them, I usually like them too. However, on the rare occasion when I've criticized a popular film, I've been sent some abusive personal comments. If you disagree with me, I'm happy to have you tell me so. Maybe I'll learn why other people think this film is so good. However, please don't use the opportunity to comment on my parentage, my species, or the depth of my mental inadequacies. Thanks, Red-125

    The Thin Man is directed by W.S Van Dyke,produced by Hunt Stromberg,with a screenplay written by Albert Hackett(based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett)and stars William Powell,Myrna Loy,Maureen O'Sullivan and Cesar Romero. Powell and Loy's chemistry in the film Manhattan Melodrama(1934)was so impressive that Van Dyke made sure they starred in his next film The Thin Man.It is in the Thin Man that they really shine together,both perfectly in tune with one another creating one of the most memorable screen marriages ever seen.In their hands Nick and Nora become a unique couple who not only love each other,they like each other and treat each other as complete equals. Former Private Detective Nick Charles(William Powell)returns home to New York with his new wife Nora(Myrna Loy)and the couples adorable dog Asta.Nick's approached by an old friend Dorothy Wynant(Maureen O'Sullivan)who's father Clyde(Edward Ellis)is the prime suspect in the murder of her Dorothy's stepmother.She doesn't believe the charge for a second,not just for personal intuition but for the fact her father has been missing for a while.She asks Nick to look for him and he eventually agrees to take on the case.Aided by Nora Nick sinks his teeth into the mystery of the Thin Man and at an unforgettable dinner party reveals both who the real murderer is and the fate of the missing man. One of the most discussed aspects of this film is Nick and Nora's constant drinking.Powell's laconic Nick may at times seem like an alcoholic but he is never out of control and slips back and forth between giddy charmer and active,sober sleuth with such ease your never quite sure if his drinking is all an act.In Loy's case she makes Nora's drinking seem both sophisticated and simply a natural extension of this elegant young woman's personality. The amount of booze consumed in the film truly reaches almost farcical levels at times(perhaps a nod to the Great Depression,now it's over lets live the good life).Despite that it somehow fits as an almost necessary element to the story(it's presence adds greatly to the films comedy). It's pointless watching this for the story,it's convoluted and quite frankly distracts from the relationship between Nick and Nora.It is they and not the plot,who are the films strongest point.The snappy banter between the two is expertly written,with lines often not striking the audience as funny until several seconds after they are spoken.The deep affection Nick has for Nora often doesn't require words, it's present simply in the looks the couple share,and she in turn adores him and wants to share in his work,even when danger threatens. Powell and Loy starred in several sequels and The Thin Man was obviously the inspiration for TV series such as Hart To Hart.Witty,exciting and complex you should seek out the Thin Man as soon as possible,you won't be disappointed.

    THE THIN MAN (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1934), directed by W.S. Van Dyke, from the novel by Dashiell Hammett, is a classic mystery-comedy that helped establish the careers of both its leading performers, William Powell and Myrna Loy, Powell especially, in a performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination. There have been mystery-comedies prior to this, A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT (Allied, 1933) with Ginger Rogers and Lyle Talbot as rival news reporters that immediately comes to mind, but THE THIN MAN stands in a class by itself. With the plot set in New York City at the start of the Christmas season, the ten minute prologue begins with Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), an absent-minded inventor, who discovers that his secretary, Julia Wolfe (Natalie Moorehead), with whom he has been carrying on a romancer, has stolen $50,000 worth of government bonds he's been saving for the upcoming wedding of his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan) to Andrew (Henry Wadsworth). Wynant confronts Julia with his accusations, and after learning the truth, he angrily walks out of the apartment down the dark streets alone. The story gets underway as Wynant's ex-wife, Mimi (Minna Gombell), in desperate need of money, comes to visit Julia to learn of Wynant's whereabouts. After entering the apartment, she finds her dead. Before the police are called, Mimi takes something from Julia's hand belonging to Wynant, and withholds the item as possible evidence. As for Dorothy, she suspects something terribly wrong when her father, away on a secret trip unknown even to his personal attorney, Herbert McCauley (Porter Hall), hasn't returned in time for the wedding. She soon takes her worries to Nick Charles (William Powell), a friend of the family having a time of his life drinking cocktails in a speakeasy. Nick, a former detective visiting from San Francisco with his wealthy wife, Nora (Myrna Loy), is asked to investigate. At first Nick declines, but after three additional murders take place, linking it all to gray-haired thin man, Wynant, now missing for three months, Nick, at Nora's urging, comes out of his four years of carefree living to look into the case. Along with Lieutenant John Guild (Nat Pendleton) and his dog, Asta, Nick stumbles upon some clues while investigating in Wynant's workshop, to surprising and unexpected results. Suspects in question include William Henry as Wynant's studious intellectual son, Gilbert; Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgensen, a lazy loafer living off Mimi; and Julia's gangster acquaintances played by Edward Brophy (Joe Morelli); and Harold Huber (Nunheimer), the latter being murder victim number three. Then there's Bert Roach being the overgrown crybaby guest at the Christmas Eve party wanting to use Nick's phone to call his "maw" long distance. The success or failure for any motion picture relies simply on fine scripting (Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich) and perfect casting. THE THIN MAN succeeds on those counts and chemistry by Powell and Loy. Having already some detective experience to his name, that of Philo Vance on three separate occasions, "The Canary Murder Case" 1929); "The Benson Murder Case" (1930 and "The Kennel Murder Case" (1933), Powell's Nick Charles, unlike any other detective commonly found in motion picture mysteries, is very much witty, down to earth, and of course, married. Rather than typically presenting a detective sleuthing with a male counterpart as comedy relief, a gal reporter, or very much alone, Nick Charles is assisted by Asta, his wire-haired fox terrier. Observant and clever with his deductions, Nick Charles is also quick with his responses, a fondness for liquor and fun at parties. His friends are usually ex-cons whom he's "sent up the river,"holding no grudge against him. Myrna Loy has found her true character in Nora Charles. Breaking away from the stereotype bossy spouse, she accepts her husband for what and whom he is, and equals with his enjoyment of fun and mystery combined. Great scene captures her sitting on the couch gowned in fur coat calmly watching her husband being a little boy at heart playing with the sling shot he's gotten for Christmas, shooting away the ornaments hanging on the Christmas tree one by one. As much as Nora would prefer sleuthing with him during his investigations, she seldom gets that chance. The climatic finish where Nick summons all connected with the case at the dinner gathering is well constructed in both humor and suspense. The success of THE THIN MAN not only brought forth many imitations, but five additional sequels starring Powell and Loy, along with the basis of a 1957-59 television series starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk, but nothing to compare with the 1934 original, being the most famous and revived of all the "Thin Man" presentations combined. Distributed to video cassette as early as the 1980s by MGM Home Video enclosed in plastic clam shells, cable television presentations on the Disney Channel's "Best of Hollywood" in the 1990s, Turner Classic Movies from 1994 onward, and finally DVD where this and others continue to acquire both a new audience along with those who know who the killer is but to just simply want to watch over and over again in the manner of Nick and Nora Charles, just for the fun of it.

    The Thin Man is directed by W. S. Van Dyke and co-written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. It is based on the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name. Starring are William Powell and Myrna Loy, with support coming from Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Porter Hall and Skippy as Astra the dog. William Axt scores the music and James Wong Howe is the cinematographer. Plot finds Powell and Loy as married couple, Nick and Nora Charles, he is a retired detective, she a good time heiress. Planning to finally settle down, their life is upturned when Nick is called back into detective work due to a friend's disappearance and the possibility he was also involved in a murder. Murder, malarkey and mirth are about to become the order of the day. It was the big surprise hit of 1934. Afforded only a tiny budget because studio head honcho Louis B. Mayer thought it was dud material, and ordered to be completed in under three weeks time, film made stars out of Powell and Loy and coined an impressive $2 million at the box office. Also birthing a franchise (5 film sequels and a radio and television series would follow), it's a film that has irresistible charm leaping out from every frame. It's easy to see even now why a mid 1930's audience could take so warmly to such an appealing motion picture. From the off the film was in good hands, Dyke (One-Take Woody as he was sometimes known) was an unfussy director with a keen eye for pacing and casting, both of which are things that shine through in this production. There's also considerable talent in the writing, both in the source material and with the script writers. Hammett based his witty bantering couple on himself and his relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman, this was ideal material for Hackett and Goodrich, themselves a happily married couple fondly thought of in the cut and thrust world of Hollywood. As a couple they would go on to write It's a Wonderful Life for Frank Capra and win the Pulitzer Prize for their play The Diary of Anne Frank. It stands out as a film of note because it successfully marries a murder mystery story with a screwball comedy spin, this was something new and exciting. While the believable relationship between Powell and Loy was also a breath of fresh air; a married couple deeply in love, devoted, funny, boozey and bouncing off of each other with witty repartee. It can never be overstated just how good Powell and Loy are here, true enough they are given an absolutely zinging script to work from, but the level of comedy, both in visual ticks and delivery of lines, is extraordinarily high. Small budget and a small shoot, but everything else about The Thin Man is big. Big laughs, big mystery and big love, all bundled up into a joyous bit of classic cinema. 9/10

    I saw this after I had seen some of the sequels and was a bit surprised at the very dark storyline surrounding the more light material involved with solving the mystery. In the first scene we see The Thin Man who is a scientist involved in some highly suspect work that eventually gets him killed. We see that he is not a very sympathetic individual, but he does have a soft side when it comes to his daughter. There is some evidence that he is also capable of slapping women around, as indicated in a later scene with his mistress. The first half hour's darkness works surprisingly well with the more lighter material. The sequels were more interested in the shenanigans of Nick and Nora, but here they seem more involved with the sad characters and Nick's one-liners are not as pronounced as the would be in the sequels. Nick and Nora are actually more supporting characters and that may be a bit disappointing. Furtunately, there are many comic highlights involving the geeky son, the inept police and the shrill ex-wife of the scientist. The motive of the murderer is a bit underdeveloped and the ending is a bit of a letdown. It is always the least likely suspect but watch closely and you can actually figure it out pretty quickly. The movie's pace is also a bit slower than its sequels' but that is because of the relatively new adjustment to sound and not a fault of the actors. There is almost no underscoring and that gives it a sort of creepy vibe in the dramatic scenes. Good first movie but the two first sequels were a bit more funny.

    This is the start of an excellent series of Thin Man movies with William Powell and Myrna Loy as the high class couple Nick and Nora Charles, with their dog Asta. Nick is a "retired" cop who has married the rich socialite Nora. Nick is always getting involved in cases the cops can't seem to solve and of course he does solve them. Usually using his old contacts with his old underworld buddies that he had given breaks to over the years. The repartee between the couple is pretty funny at times and Asta is a well trained dog who comes across as cowardly. Both of the Charles's like to drink and party some, my kind of people!! Most of action is fairly low keyed and I think is done to make the audience think.

    This film was based on one book, and because it was so popular it was turned into a six film series, with the lead stars returning for all of them, and this the first film is the one that appeared in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was most interested to watch it. Basically retired detective Nick Charles (Oscar nominated William Powell) and his wife Nora (Myrna Loy) are trying to settle down, but a friend of his, Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), the "thin man" of the title, disappears and may be involved in a murder, so he is pulled back into action to investigate. The man who has vanished is the prime suspect to the murder of his former secretary and girlfriend Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead) as all the evidence points to him, but the one who doesn't believe he has any involvement is his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan), and is the one who convinces the former private eye to take the case. This amuses his wife, but Nick does stumble onto some clues and pieces together the facts for an intense investigation, and he eventually comes to conclude who the murderer really is, but he is not telling anybody his findings until an event he is putting on. All the guests he is inviting are the ones he believes are capable of murder, but he knows only one really did the crime, and a classic dinner party scene, and with explanations of each person's involvement in the recent events, including the skeleton body of missing Mynant found who was killed for his money. Also starring Nat Pendleton as Inspector John Guild , Minna Gombell as Mimi Wynant, Porter Hall as Herbert MacCaulay, Henry Wadsworth as Tommy, William Henry as Gilbert Wynant, Harold Huber as Arthur Nunheim, Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgenson, Edward Brophy as Joe Morelli and Cyril Thornton as Tanner. Powell gives a leading performance with his clever theorising and charming wit, Loy is really likable as his wife who is by his side throughout, together they make a great duo, so it is no wonder that sequels followed, if you like mystery mixed with some good laughs then this good entertainment, a fun classic detective comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for W.S. Van Dyke, Best Picture and Best Writing, Adaptation. It was number 32 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    "The Thin Man" is a smart, sophisticated, urban whodunit staged with Spartan style and little nonsense by W.S. Van Dyke who went on to helm the first three entries in the six film franchise. This was not the first time that mustached William Powell either played a detective or paired up with Myrna Loy. They co-starred in several movies before and after "The Thin Man" series, such "Manhattan Melodrama," "The Great Ziegfeld," "Libeled Lady," "Double Wedding," "Love Crazy," "I Love You Again," and "Evelyn Prentice." This clever mystery thriller unfolds in three-acts. The suspects and the situation are laid out in crisp, expository fashion, and then we meet Nick & Nora Charles who become involved in the mystery. It seems our hero knew one of the suspects. This association draws him into the investigation. All this is capped off with a huge party that Nick throws for the suspects to smoke out the murderer. A variety of characters make up the cast. Remember, M-G-M produced this mystery back in 1934, when Hollywood couldn't depict violence with any realistic detail. As it is, "The Thin Man" looks like a drinking man's champ. Our hero guzzles and so do many others. Nick has guzzled six martinis by the time his wife joins him in the bar. This 91-minute melodrama qualifies as a Christmas movie because it occurs during the holiday season. The dialogue is often snappy, especially the being "shot five times in the tabloids." The secretary of an eccentric scientist, Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorhead of "The King Murder"), has been murdered. The eccentric scientist, Gilbert Wynant (William Henry of "Rubber Racketeers"), vanishes afterward without a trace. Earlier, Wynant's wife Mimi (Minna Gombell of "High Sierra") divorced him because of a fling with Ms. Wolf. Worst, the conniving secretary was up to no good under Wynant's very nose. Quietly enough, Julia had been embezzling money; she cashed in two bonds amounting to $50-thousand. Wynant catches her with a gangster, Morelli (Edward Brophy), and they quarrel about the kind of men that she ahs been seeing. Gilbert Wynant is the jealous type. Myrna Loy's entrance in the action is funny. Asta literally drags her with packages piled up in her arms. Later, Wynant's attorney Herbert MacCaulay (Porter Hall of "His Girl Friday"), inquires if Nick is sleuthing for Wynant's ex-wife. Nick informs MacCaulay he gave up being a private eye four years ago. "My wife's father died and left her a narrow gauge railway, and a lumber mill, and several other things. I'm taking care of them." When they have this conversation, Wynant has been missing for three months. The first entry in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's "Thin Man" franchise, "The Thin Man," takes about twenty minutes before Nick Charles (William Powell) makes his entrance. He is teaching bartenders how to mix various alcoholic beverages. "You see, the important thing is the rhythm. You should always have rhythm in your shaking. "A Manhattan you shake to a fox trot. A Bronx to a two-step time. A dry martini you always shake to waltzes." When he completes this elaboration lecture, Nick takes the drink that he prepared so fastidiously and sips it. Wynant's daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan of "Tarzan of the Apes") walks up to him and informs him that she remembers him from a case. Dorothy is searching for her father. Mimi goes to see Julia Wolf about getting more money. Morelli (Edward Brophy of "All Through the Night") learns about Julia's murder and barges into Nick's apartment. Morelli tries to kill Nick, and the authorities are suspicious about our hero. The police confiscate an unregistered gun and promise to ask him more questions. Nick Charles hasn't worked on a case as a private eye for four years. Since he has married Mrs. Charles, he handles his wife's considerable affairs. Eventually, Inspector John Guild (Nat Pendleton of "Trapped by Television") convinces Nick to work with them. Nora persuades Nick to take the case after the fugitive, Gilbert Wynant sends him a request to investigate the case. Reluctantly, Nick takes Asta and goes prowling in the dark. He uncovers an unidentified body in Wynant's laboratory. Meantime, the police and the press believe that Wynant has killed three people. The use of modern technology at the time helps Nick to find the answer that he is looking for but nobody else knows. Nick and Nora are a couple to watch.

    "The Thin Man" (1934) is one of the best films ever made....a great stage play made into a great movie. It was originally a stage play written by Dashiell Hammett, and no doubt retained most of Hammett's great writing when Albert Hackett and his then young wife, Frances Goodrich turned the play into a movie script. This was the first important movie where the lead romantic couple exchange in banter and "repartee" which reflected the acceptance (finally) in the 1930's the "the independent woman" (even married independent women!) in USA culture, less than two decades after women finally "got the vote." Major players and minor supporting actors in "The Thin Man" (1934) are all lovable, and that includes the villain, lawyer Herbert MacCauley, marvelously portrayed by long time movie character actor of note, Porter Hall. The story is a "Whodunit" and the audience never guesses the real culprit until the penultimate scene (the next to the last scene) when hero detective, Nick Charles (played to perfection by William Powell), hosts a grand dinner for half a dozen likely suspects (and police in attendance, too, both as tuxedo clad guests and also as waiter staffers!), and fingers the guilty guy. Many people opine that the best final scene in any movie is the one in Casablanca (1943) where Humphrey Bogart (playing "Rick Blaine") tells Claude Rains (playing the French "Prefect Of Police" who just helped Bogart and now becomes a fugitive along with Bogart) tells his new friend, and fellow accomplice, "Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship." But I think "The Thin Man" (1934) has the best final scene of all. It's a rapid fire "end of the film" portrait of the Nick and Nora Charles married couple about to get to bed in a moving railroad train private room, this in a movie which shows the two alone together in bedrooms before with nothing sexy at all happening between them. The audience sees unexpected beginnings of "married love," and the camera switches instantly to the nighttime train entering a tunnel with the "San Francisco, Here I Come" tune played brightly and zestfully. Alfred Hitchcock used the same "affectionate couple (Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint) about to get into bed together on a train, then quick switch to train entering a tunnel" at the end of "North By Northwest" (1959), but that movie ending didn't have "San Francisco, Here I Come" music along with it, and that makes all the difference! ---------------------- Written by David R.

    There wasn't any film noir at the time. There were a few early notions formed in Weimar Germany about dazed minds succumbing to control of storymakers. The femme fatale was beginning to get shape as a force in the story. And then there was the detective film; each studio run its own highly successful series, each one influenced by the one before. Fox had Charlie Chan, and less famously Peter Lorre's Mr. Moto. Monogram responded with the Chinese Mr. Wong. RKO had Withers. Warners run the Perry Mason cycle. These were more or less debonair sleuths, gentle, delicate beings, after the stereotypical notion for Sherlock Holmes. And of course The Thin Man, I believe six films in total pairing William Powell with Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, dilettantes and sleuths, also openly quoting Holmes. The game here is that the detective plot is incidental to the story and only the hook that lets all the other effects sink in. The screwball comedy, the sexual innuendo, the fashions, the wit as dry as the martinis. You may piece something together but quite apart from what sleuthing is going on; no one is really sure if the sleuth is on the case or not, including him, the clues and suspects are laid out on his living-room in the middle of a party and they're merely a lot of noise that gets in the way of sipping one martini after another. Our introduction to Nick is where he's showing waiters how to shake cocktails, foreshadowing handling of the case to us. Naturally he pieces everything together in the final explanatory denouement; a dinner party with all the suspects invited, one of them the killer. No device is more contrived these days, in part because it used to work so well. You didn't have to puzzle about any of this, or fates in control of the thing, because there were none. All you had to do was kick back and sip at all the extraordinary chintz of the sleuthing. This type of film culminates in the Maltese Falcon, incidentally also adapted from Hammett and the shift towards noir proper. The more elaborate trick there was that all the suspects were aware of a ridiculous detective film going on, and constantly switched between elated viewers and mischievous storymakers. Sam Spade's main assets were great acting and making up stories. The only mischief going on here is between Nick and Nora, who constantly wink at each other about sex they're not having - until the end. Their chemistry sizzles in a way that deep love does.

    The Thin Man (1934) was directed by W.S. Van Dyke. This picture has an extremely high IMDb weighted average of 8.1. I had great hopes for this film, which we saw at a New Year's eve showing at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman House in Rochester. I'm sorry to report that the film didn't work for me at any level. William Powell and Myrna Loy play Nick and Nora Charles. He's a former detective, she's an heiress. They are rich, glamorous, and very, very sophisticated. Powell and Loy were wildly popular in these roles, and reprised them again and again. Powell more or less looks the part, but I think Loy was miscast. She looks and acts like one of the bright, snappy, working-class women in a screwball comedy. She doesn't look or act like an heiress. A second problem I had with the film was the unending focus on alcohol consumption. Getting and being drunk was far more acceptable in society then than it is now. Even so, the film really wasn't about mystery or romance--it was about drinking. People are endlessly talking about drinking, or they're drinking, or they're holding icepacks to their heads on the morning after. Powell acts half-drunk for most of the film. (For the rest of the film he acts drunk.) I just don't find that entertaining. For me, the highlight of the evening happened before the film. The Eastman House volunteer who presented the film came dressed in a long, slinky, 1930's-style gown. She gave a witty, intelligent talk. This woman had the physical and mental attributes that would have made her a perfect Nora Charles. It's too bad that her role ended when the lights in the theater dimmed. P.S. I rarely post negative reviews of films that other IMDb reviewers have liked. That's not because I'm timid, but rather because if others liked them, I usually like them too. However, on the rare occasion when I've criticized a popular film, I've been sent some abusive personal comments. If you disagree with me, I'm happy to have you tell me so. Maybe I'll learn why other people think this film is so good. However, please don't use the opportunity to comment on my parentage, my species, or the depth of my mental inadequacies. Thanks, Red-125

    The Thin Man is directed by W.S Van Dyke,produced by Hunt Stromberg,with a screenplay written by Albert Hackett(based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett)and stars William Powell,Myrna Loy,Maureen O'Sullivan and Cesar Romero. Powell and Loy's chemistry in the film Manhattan Melodrama(1934)was so impressive that Van Dyke made sure they starred in his next film The Thin Man.It is in the Thin Man that they really shine together,both perfectly in tune with one another creating one of the most memorable screen marriages ever seen.In their hands Nick and Nora become a unique couple who not only love each other,they like each other and treat each other as complete equals. Former Private Detective Nick Charles(William Powell)returns home to New York with his new wife Nora(Myrna Loy)and the couples adorable dog Asta.Nick's approached by an old friend Dorothy Wynant(Maureen O'Sullivan)who's father Clyde(Edward Ellis)is the prime suspect in the murder of her Dorothy's stepmother.She doesn't believe the charge for a second,not just for personal intuition but for the fact her father has been missing for a while.She asks Nick to look for him and he eventually agrees to take on the case.Aided by Nora Nick sinks his teeth into the mystery of the Thin Man and at an unforgettable dinner party reveals both who the real murderer is and the fate of the missing man. One of the most discussed aspects of this film is Nick and Nora's constant drinking.Powell's laconic Nick may at times seem like an alcoholic but he is never out of control and slips back and forth between giddy charmer and active,sober sleuth with such ease your never quite sure if his drinking is all an act.In Loy's case she makes Nora's drinking seem both sophisticated and simply a natural extension of this elegant young woman's personality. The amount of booze consumed in the film truly reaches almost farcical levels at times(perhaps a nod to the Great Depression,now it's over lets live the good life).Despite that it somehow fits as an almost necessary element to the story(it's presence adds greatly to the films comedy). It's pointless watching this for the story,it's convoluted and quite frankly distracts from the relationship between Nick and Nora.It is they and not the plot,who are the films strongest point.The snappy banter between the two is expertly written,with lines often not striking the audience as funny until several seconds after they are spoken.The deep affection Nick has for Nora often doesn't require words, it's present simply in the looks the couple share,and she in turn adores him and wants to share in his work,even when danger threatens. Powell and Loy starred in several sequels and The Thin Man was obviously the inspiration for TV series such as Hart To Hart.Witty,exciting and complex you should seek out the Thin Man as soon as possible,you won't be disappointed.

    THE THIN MAN (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1934), directed by W.S. Van Dyke, from the novel by Dashiell Hammett, is a classic mystery-comedy that helped establish the careers of both its leading performers, William Powell and Myrna Loy, Powell especially, in a performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination. There have been mystery-comedies prior to this, A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT (Allied, 1933) with Ginger Rogers and Lyle Talbot as rival news reporters that immediately comes to mind, but THE THIN MAN stands in a class by itself. With the plot set in New York City at the start of the Christmas season, the ten minute prologue begins with Clyde Wynant (Edward Ellis), an absent-minded inventor, who discovers that his secretary, Julia Wolfe (Natalie Moorehead), with whom he has been carrying on a romancer, has stolen $50,000 worth of government bonds he's been saving for the upcoming wedding of his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan) to Andrew (Henry Wadsworth). Wynant confronts Julia with his accusations, and after learning the truth, he angrily walks out of the apartment down the dark streets alone. The story gets underway as Wynant's ex-wife, Mimi (Minna Gombell), in desperate need of money, comes to visit Julia to learn of Wynant's whereabouts. After entering the apartment, she finds her dead. Before the police are called, Mimi takes something from Julia's hand belonging to Wynant, and withholds the item as possible evidence. As for Dorothy, she suspects something terribly wrong when her father, away on a secret trip unknown even to his personal attorney, Herbert McCauley (Porter Hall), hasn't returned in time for the wedding. She soon takes her worries to Nick Charles (William Powell), a friend of the family having a time of his life drinking cocktails in a speakeasy. Nick, a former detective visiting from San Francisco with his wealthy wife, Nora (Myrna Loy), is asked to investigate. At first Nick declines, but after three additional murders take place, linking it all to gray-haired thin man, Wynant, now missing for three months, Nick, at Nora's urging, comes out of his four years of carefree living to look into the case. Along with Lieutenant John Guild (Nat Pendleton) and his dog, Asta, Nick stumbles upon some clues while investigating in Wynant's workshop, to surprising and unexpected results. Suspects in question include William Henry as Wynant's studious intellectual son, Gilbert; Cesar Romero as Chris Jorgensen, a lazy loafer living off Mimi; and Julia's gangster acquaintances played by Edward Brophy (Joe Morelli); and Harold Huber (Nunheimer), the latter being murder victim number three. Then there's Bert Roach being the overgrown crybaby guest at the Christmas Eve party wanting to use Nick's phone to call his "maw" long distance. The success or failure for any motion picture relies simply on fine scripting (Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich) and perfect casting. THE THIN MAN succeeds on those counts and chemistry by Powell and Loy. Having already some detective experience to his name, that of Philo Vance on three separate occasions, "The Canary Murder Case" 1929); "The Benson Murder Case" (1930 and "The Kennel Murder Case" (1933), Powell's Nick Charles, unlike any other detective commonly found in motion picture mysteries, is very much witty, down to earth, and of course, married. Rather than typically presenting a detective sleuthing with a male counterpart as comedy relief, a gal reporter, or very much alone, Nick Charles is assisted by Asta, his wire-haired fox terrier. Observant and clever with his deductions, Nick Charles is also quick with his responses, a fondness for liquor and fun at parties. His friends are usually ex-cons whom he's "sent up the river,"holding no grudge against him. Myrna Loy has found her true character in Nora Charles. Breaking away from the stereotype bossy spouse, she accepts her husband for what and whom he is, and equals with his enjoyment of fun and mystery combined. Great scene captures her sitting on the couch gowned in fur coat calmly watching her husband being a little boy at heart playing with the sling shot he's gotten for Christmas, shooting away the ornaments hanging on the Christmas tree one by one. As much as Nora would prefer sleuthing with him during his investigations, she seldom gets that chance. The climatic finish where Nick summons all connected with the case at the dinner gathering is well constructed in both humor and suspense. The success of THE THIN MAN not only brought forth many imitations, but five additional sequels starring Powell and Loy, along with the basis of a 1957-59 television series starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk, but nothing to compare with the 1934 original, being the most famous and revived of all the "Thin Man" presentations combined. Distributed to video cassette as early as the 1980s by MGM Home Video enclosed in plastic clam shells, cable television presentations on the Disney Channel's "Best of Hollywood" in the 1990s, Turner Classic Movies from 1994 onward, and finally DVD where this and others continue to acquire both a new audience along with those who know who the killer is but to just simply want to watch over and over again in the manner of Nick and Nora Charles, just for the fun of it.

    The Thin Man is directed by W. S. Van Dyke and co-written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. It is based on the Dashiell Hammett novel of the same name. Starring are William Powell and Myrna Loy, with support coming from Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Porter Hall and Skippy as Astra the dog. William Axt scores the music and James Wong Howe is the cinematographer. Plot finds Powell and Loy as married couple, Nick and Nora Charles, he is a retired detective, she a good time heiress. Planning to finally settle down, their life is upturned when Nick is called back into detective work due to a friend's disappearance and the possibility he was also involved in a murder. Murder, malarkey and mirth are about to become the order of the day. It was the big surprise hit of 1934. Afforded only a tiny budget because studio head honcho Louis B. Mayer thought it was dud material, and ordered to be completed in under three weeks time, film made stars out of Powell and Loy and coined an impressive $2 million at the box office. Also birthing a franchise (5 film sequels and a radio and television series would follow), it's a film that has irresistible charm leaping out from every frame. It's easy to see even now why a mid 1930's audience could take so warmly to such an appealing motion picture. From the off the film was in good hands, Dyke (One-Take Woody as he was sometimes known) was an unfussy director with a keen eye for pacing and casting, both of which are things that shine through in this production. There's also considerable talent in the writing, both in the source material and with the script writers. Hammett based his witty bantering couple on himself and his relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman, this was ideal material for Hackett and Goodrich, themselves a happily married couple fondly thought of in the cut and thrust world of Hollywood. As a couple they would go on to write It's a Wonderful Life for Frank Capra and win the Pulitzer Prize for their play The Diary of Anne Frank. It stands out as a film of note because it successfully marries a murder mystery story with a screwball comedy spin, this was something new and exciting. While the believable relationship between Powell and Loy was also a breath of fresh air; a married couple deeply in love, devoted, funny, boozey and bouncing off of each other with witty repartee. It can never be overstated just how good Powell and Loy are here, true enough they are given an absolutely zinging script to work from, but the level of comedy, both in visual ticks and delivery of lines, is extraordinarily high. Small budget and a small shoot, but everything else about The Thin Man is big. Big laughs, big mystery and big love, all bundled up into a joyous bit of classic cinema. 9/10

    A good mixture of surprisingly dark drama and lighthearted comedy

    I saw this after I had seen some of the sequels and was a bit surprised at the very dark storyline surrounding the more light material involved with solving the mystery. In the first scene we see The Thin Man who is a scientist involved in some highly suspect work that eventually gets him killed. We see that he is not a very sympathetic individual, but he does have a soft side when it comes to his daughter. There is some evidence that he is also capable of slapping women around, as indicated in a later scene with his mistress. The first half hour's darkness works surprisingly well with the more lighter material. The sequels were more interested in the shenanigans of Nick and Nora, but here they seem more involved with the sad characters and Nick's one-liners are not as pronounced as the would be in the sequels. Nick and Nora are actually more supporting characters and that may be a bit disappointing. Furtunately, there are many comic highlights involving the geeky son, the inept police and the shrill ex-wife of the scientist. The motive of the murderer is a bit underdeveloped and the ending is a bit of a letdown. It is always the least likely suspect but watch closely and you can actually figure it out pretty quickly. The movie's pace is also a bit slower than its sequels' but that is because of the relatively new adjustment to sound and not a fault of the actors. There is almost no underscoring and that gives it a sort of creepy vibe in the dramatic scenes. Good first movie but the two first sequels were a bit more funny.
