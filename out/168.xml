 <sinopse>
  King Arthur and his knights embark on a low-budget search for the Grail, encountering many very silly obstacles.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The movie starts out with Arthur, King of the Britons, looking for knights to sit with him at Camelot. He finds many knights including Sir Galahad the pure, Sir Lancelot the brave, the quiet Sir Bedevere, and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir Lancelot. They do not travel on horses, but pretend they do and have their servants bang coconuts to make the sound of horse's hooves. Through satire of certain events in history (witch trials, the black plague) they find Camelot, but after literally a quick song and dance they decide that they do not want to go there. While walking away, God (who seems to be grumpy) come to them from a cloud and tells them to find the Holy Grail. They agree and begin their search. While they search for the Grail, scenes of the knight's tales appear and why they have the name they have. Throughout their search they meet interesting people and knights along the way. Most of the characters die; some through a killer rabbit (which they defeat with the holy ...

    In England in 932AD, King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table are charged with a sacred quest to find the Holy Grail of biblical legend. However, if they should doubt their courage or their strength, death awaits them all with nasty big pointy teeth ... Made for the vast sum of &pound;229,575, this comic cult classic is one of the funniest and most original movies ever made. The combination of the weird, zany, shocking, argumentative, stream-of-consciousness humour of the Monty Python troupe within the historical context of Arthurian legend is simply brilliant. The Pythons are able to simultaneously create a visually exciting movie of medieval times but then break all the rules about how such movies should play out. Typical example - the coconuts idea is a great visual joke based on budgetary limitations (they couldn't afford any horses) which they also turned into a hilarious opening scene where they bicker over the anachronistic existence of tropical fruit in Anglo-Saxon Britain. The movie is both great fun to watch in of itself, but also even more fun to laugh at as a satire of historical/action/period films in general (such as the "bad editing" joke when Sir Lancelot storms Swamp Castle). The dialogue is priceless throughout, with gags ranging from the cerebral to the gloriously offensive, but perhaps most importantly the film has a truly inspired sense of the visual - the Black Knight sequence, the Trojan Rabbit, the dreaded Cave Of Caerbannog, and many other great moments. This is the only Python movie directed by both the Terrys, and it combines the best qualities of Jones' character comedy with Gilliam's artist's perspective. If it has one limitation, it's that a few scenes feel like individual sketches within the larger film, but the episodic nature of the story covers this quite nicely. Everybody is terrific in it and Palin and Idle possibly win a joint award for most characters played in a feature, with at least seven speaking parts each. I especially like Gilliam as The Old Man From Scene 24. The Pythons only made four movies (five if you count the Hollywood Bowl concert), all of which are terrific but have different strengths and weaknesses. This one is perhaps the most fun and (despite its cult credentials) the most accessible, and is not to be missed. Shot mostly in Scotland, notably at Doune Castle in Perthshire and Castle Stalker in Argyll, this makes a great double-bill with John Boorman's Excalibur, but make sure you watch the Monty Python film second. And always remember, just walk away from any French people taunting you.

    Monty Python and the holy grail is somehow the funniest movie ever. I never saw his show but I hope it's funny as this. Join Arthur, King of the Britains, on his quest to Camelot (that quickly ends after a hysterical musical number). So instead join him on his quest to find the holy grail along with Brave Sir robin, Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad, and Sir not appearing in this film. Each will have a story in between their quest. Sir Robin will almost fight an annoying but funny 3-headed person, but he runs away before they chop his head off. Sir Galahad finds the grail in a building filled with horny nuns but he is saved by the others before he spanks them. Sir Lancelot will save a prince before he gets married and he kills every guest at the wedding (funniest part of the movie) This would have been the most perfect movie if it wasn't for the ending where everyone gets arrested for killing a famous historian. That part upset me the most but I still love this film. Watch this and you'll change your mind about thinking Paul Blart Mall Cop is the funniest (like some people AKA my friend that I can't say the name of). I would say Monty Python and the Holy Grail is... "An Amazing Legendary Legend of some sorts"

    Before Holy Grail, the Pythons had not shown that long-form comedy was within their range. The longest sketches on their Flying Circus TV show, like "Scott of the Antarctic" or "The Piranha Brothers," ran at most ten or fifteen minutes. Terry Gilliam, unquestionably the sixth of the six main cast members, had filled some of the more outlandish bit parts in the show but was best known for creating its often-perverse animated sequences. Holy Grail changed all of that. The troupe's stock-in-trade, satirical setups that devolve almost instantly into absurdity, proved so adaptable to the feature-length format that Holy Grail became arguably their most widely-recognized and beloved work. Most of the individual vignettes, like the Black Knight and the witch- weighing scene, derive from the medieval setting, but the cadence of the delivery and the flair for wordplay are distinctly Pythonian. The film was also the springboard for Terry Gilliam's surprisingly-successful directorial career, and is a good example of his ability to create an off-kilter, vaguely-creepy atmosphere.

    I do not understand why almost all of the IMDb user reviews give this movie 8 or more stars. It was terrible quality recording (NOT EVEN HD!) with unbelievably horrible effects. It wasn't funny at all and the ending was the worst ending i have ever seen in any movie, it was so stupid, i felt like stabbing needles in my eyes so i would become blind and never have to see that movie ever again. And the plot was a complete copy of Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull. The soundtrack was also very stupid, the entire movie didn't even have 10 songs and all the songs that were in the movie, no one would even know because they're so old, in fact, they're probably from even before 2008 or 2007! They should put songs in there that people actually recognize like maroon 5 songs and LMFAO songs! I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I regret watching it and i will never in my entire life regret typing this online review. WORST. COMEDY. EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!

    The one thing that I love about these Monty Python movies is not only how the humor can be quite farcical and outrageous, but that they are also quite realistic in it at times as well. One one hand you will have somebody blabbering on about nothing in particular and the film then cuts to shots of people crying out 'get on with it!'. Then there is the ongoing joke of the sparrow carrying a coconut which, when I first watched it, thought that it was some off handed remark made during the scene with the keeper of the bridge, until I realised that right at the beginning, when King Arthur first appears with his peasant banging two coconuts together, there is a discussion as to whether it is possible for a sparrow to carry a coconut to England (and there is another scene where a knight is attempting to tie a coconut to a sparrow to see if one can actually carry it). As for the realistic parts of it, they do a fantastic job with it as well. For instance when Arthur 'rides' through a town one of the peasants asks who he is and another says that he is the king, and the only reason that they think he is a king is because he is clean (I won't repeat what they actually said in the movie because IMDb will then not allow me to post this commentary). It is also interesting how a group of peasants don't even know the king when he rides up to them (and they starts sprouting out Marxist doctrine  Python loves to use anachronisms in the movie, and for some reason, actually get away with it). While it is humorous, it is also true because it is highly unlikely that in those days the peasants would actually know what the king looked like. As for the ending, well, that probably will go down in history as pretty much the most unexpected ending for a film to take. It simply comes completely out of left field, though it is not actually out of the blue because there are hints that it will be heading in that direction, but you still don't expect the police to rock up and proceed to arrest King Arthur and his Knights. Mind you when I saw Spamalot when I was in London I was actually very disappointed at the ending because, well, they actually found the Holy Grail. Okay, it was only 'based' on this film, but to be honest with you, I so prefer this movie than I did not musical (and am kicking myself that I did not go and see Rowan Atkinson). Oh, yeah, and I suspect that Tarantino may have picked up a thing or two with regards to the use of violence because some of the scenes in this movie are so Tarantino.

King Arthur heads off on a journey with his knights to Camelot,but when he decides not to go to Camelot because 'it is a silly place',they go and seek the Holy Grail,but a lot of obstacles get in their way.

    I am 16 years old and very proud of myself and my friends who grown up on these kind of films. We laugh a lot on it today too, we usually watch it again and again just like other films kind of this. The movie could make us to enjoy the older creations and later, when we got a bit old, found out the real meaning of the story and the scenes. If You watch it for the first time, then do search for some criticism. You will find out what is it all about, I'm sure. There are a lot of funny scenes and quotes that can fade the real messages but if you can see through this, not necessary for the first time. You don't have to search for it because it has a really different meaning if you don't want to search for more. It is not bad, it's just different. Funnier, light-minded.

    Monty Python and the Holy Grail is an overall great movie directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, starring the usual suspects in a Monty Python film such as Graham Champman, and John Cleese. In this film we find ourselves following our main character King Arthur (Graham Chapman) as he gathers his knights of the round table to embark on a quest to find the Holy Grail. The actors in this film defiantly DO NOT live up to any historical depiction of any king or knight that may have ever existed, but this is what we have come to love and expect out of the Monty Python crew. The style and theme of this film can only be described as cheap in the best sort of way. One would assume that in medieval times travel would mostly be done on horses, well Monty Python does not disappoint. No expense was speared when collecting the coconuts used to produce hoof sounds throughout the movie. That's right there are no horses in this movie, just men acting as if they were on horses while another man follows them around with coconuts. In conclusion I would have to say that following these men around on their adventure is definitely time well spent. I'll be watching this movie over and over, and will be getting just as much enjoyment out of it the hundredth time as I did the first.

    I absolutely loved this movie! It's got everything in it a comedian would be looking for. There is never a dull moment in "The Holy Grail". Graham Chapman plays a superb role as King Arthur alongside other great actors who flowed with the energy and excellent humor of this memorable film. Even though it is a ridiculous, nonsensical film (the killer rabbit, the crazy starting credits, and the ending should throw a thumbs up for that), it has a unique style that always get you laughing. Some of my favorite scenes in this movie (there are many) have to be the Bridge of Death scene (WHAT is your favorite color...WHAT is the capitol of Syria?), the killer rabbit, and the guards who have a hard time figuring out if they should leave the room or not (so we stay here and guard the prisoner...until you leave...and then we follow you. But wait, do we take him with us?). The comic geniuses behind this film deserve a lot of credit for putting in moments in the film that were not meant to be taken seriously or require much thought but just to make you sit back and think "Man, what are they going to do next? This is hilarious!". It's just a pure fun,entertaining comedy film that anyone of any age should enjoy. Too bad a lot of comedic films these days can't be like this one. Most have submitted to the layout standards of Hollywood films and some,incredibly ironic, don't know how to be funny or take themselves too seriously. Take a page out of Monty Python's play book. Any movie that features a gang of misfits embarking on a crazy journey that ends up nowhere(except in jail, I suppose) has got to be a real winner. Ni!

    What the Pythons did goes back to Dada in the 1910'sagainst logic and bourgeois complacency, for irrationality, chaos and the absurd as by-roads to unconscious inspiration. In this film, usually accepted as one of their best, they rail helter skelter against authority, masculine heroism, sexual hypocrisy, the chastity of romantic legend. Some of the skits work, the coconuts, duck, French siege. It's funny when it is, precisely because it's non-sense, a shrubbery of very smalls rocks. More often, it's just silly. The more of logic that is applied to explain say, coconuts in Britain, the more ludicrous logic appears to be, we recognize the truth of this in our own irrational world. But the overall film fails for my taste. It had two competing directors in Jones and Gilliam, this may account for some of it. But mostly, it is poor cinematic storytelling, one skit after the other. Even surrealism benefits from some overall framework for the experience, something to be directed to beyond reason. At the time, this wasn't as clear as it is now. The Czechs were still making movies in this disconnected vein, Svankmajer to this day. Late 60's Godard, more famously. All those things were very much in the counter-culture air in the 1970's. So as with most things of the era, this is fun for a while, fun but stale.

If You watch it for the first time, then do search for some criticism. You will find out what is it all about, I'm sure. There are a lot of funny scenes and quotes that can fade the real messages but if you can see through this, not necessary for the first time. You don't have to search for it because it has a really different meaning if you don't want to search for more. It is not bad, it's just different. Funnier, light-minded.

    Monty Python and the Holy Grail is an overall great movie directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, starring the usual suspects in a Monty Python film such as Graham Champman, and John Cleese. In this film we find ourselves following our main character King Arthur (Graham Chapman) as he gathers his knights of the round table to embark on a quest to find the Holy Grail. The actors in this film defiantly DO NOT live up to any historical depiction of any king or knight that may have ever existed, but this is what we have come to love and expect out of the Monty Python crew. The style and theme of this film can only be described as cheap in the best sort of way. One would assume that in medieval times travel would mostly be done on horses, well Monty Python does not disappoint. No expense was speared when collecting the coconuts used to produce hoof sounds throughout the movie. That's right there are no horses in this movie, just men acting as if they were on horses while another man follows them around with coconuts. In conclusion I would have to say that following these men around on their adventure is definitely time well spent. I'll be watching this movie over and over, and will be getting just as much enjoyment out of it the hundredth time as I did the first.

    I absolutely loved this movie! It's got everything in it a comedian would be looking for. There is never a dull moment in "The Holy Grail". Graham Chapman plays a superb role as King Arthur alongside other great actors who flowed with the energy and excellent humor of this memorable film. Even though it is a ridiculous, nonsensical film (the killer rabbit, the crazy starting credits, and the ending should throw a thumbs up for that), it has a unique style that always get you laughing. Some of my favorite scenes in this movie (there are many) have to be the Bridge of Death scene (WHAT is your favorite color...WHAT is the capitol of Syria?), the killer rabbit, and the guards who have a hard time figuring out if they should leave the room or not (so we stay here and guard the prisoner...until you leave...and then we follow you. But wait, do we take him with us?). The comic geniuses behind this film deserve a lot of credit for putting in moments in the film that were not meant to be taken seriously or require much thought but just to make you sit back and think "Man, what are they going to do next? This is hilarious!". It's just a pure fun,entertaining comedy film that anyone of any age should enjoy. Too bad a lot of comedic films these days can't be like this one. Most have submitted to the layout standards of Hollywood films and some,incredibly ironic, don't know how to be funny or take themselves too seriously. Take a page out of Monty Python's play book. Any movie that features a gang of misfits embarking on a crazy journey that ends up nowhere(except in jail, I suppose) has got to be a real winner. Ni!

    What the Pythons did goes back to Dada in the 1910'sagainst logic and bourgeois complacency, for irrationality, chaos and the absurd as by-roads to unconscious inspiration. In this film, usually accepted as one of their best, they rail helter skelter against authority, masculine heroism, sexual hypocrisy, the chastity of romantic legend. Some of the skits work, the coconuts, duck, French siege. It's funny when it is, precisely because it's non-sense, a shrubbery of very smalls rocks. More often, it's just silly. The more of logic that is applied to explain say, coconuts in Britain, the more ludicrous logic appears to be, we recognize the truth of this in our own irrational world. But the overall film fails for my taste. It had two competing directors in Jones and Gilliam, this may account for some of it. But mostly, it is poor cinematic storytelling, one skit after the other. Even surrealism benefits from some overall framework for the experience, something to be directed to beyond reason. At the time, this wasn't as clear as it is now. The Czechs were still making movies in this disconnected vein, Svankmajer to this day. Late 60's Godard, more famously. All those things were very much in the counter-culture air in the 1970's. So as with most things of the era, this is fun for a while, fun but stale.

    In England in 932AD, King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table are charged with a sacred quest to find the Holy Grail of biblical legend. However, if they should doubt their courage or their strength, death awaits them all with nasty big pointy teeth ... Made for the vast sum of &pound;229,575, this comic cult classic is one of the funniest and most original movies ever made. The combination of the weird, zany, shocking, argumentative, stream-of-consciousness humour of the Monty Python troupe within the historical context of Arthurian legend is simply brilliant. The Pythons are able to simultaneously create a visually exciting movie of medieval times but then break all the rules about how such movies should play out. Typical example - the coconuts idea is a great visual joke based on budgetary limitations (they couldn't afford any horses) which they also turned into a hilarious opening scene where they bicker over the anachronistic existence of tropical fruit in Anglo-Saxon Britain. The movie is both great fun to watch in of itself, but also even more fun to laugh at as a satire of historical/action/period films in general (such as the "bad editing" joke when Sir Lancelot storms Swamp Castle). The dialogue is priceless throughout, with gags ranging from the cerebral to the gloriously offensive, but perhaps most importantly the film has a truly inspired sense of the visual - the Black Knight sequence, the Trojan Rabbit, the dreaded Cave Of Caerbannog, and many other great moments. This is the only Python movie directed by both the Terrys, and it combines the best qualities of Jones' character comedy with Gilliam's artist's perspective. If it has one limitation, it's that a few scenes feel like individual sketches within the larger film, but the episodic nature of the story covers this quite nicely. Everybody is terrific in it and Palin and Idle possibly win a joint award for most characters played in a feature, with at least seven speaking parts each. I especially like Gilliam as The Old Man From Scene 24. The Pythons only made four movies (five if you count the Hollywood Bowl concert), all of which are terrific but have different strengths and weaknesses. This one is perhaps the most fun and (despite its cult credentials) the most accessible, and is not to be missed. Shot mostly in Scotland, notably at Doune Castle in Perthshire and Castle Stalker in Argyll, this makes a great double-bill with John Boorman's Excalibur, but make sure you watch the Monty Python film second. And always remember, just walk away from any French people taunting you.

    Monty Python and the holy grail is somehow the funniest movie ever. I never saw his show but I hope it's funny as this. Join Arthur, King of the Britains, on his quest to Camelot (that quickly ends after a hysterical musical number). So instead join him on his quest to find the holy grail along with Brave Sir robin, Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad, and Sir not appearing in this film. Each will have a story in between their quest. Sir Robin will almost fight an annoying but funny 3-headed person, but he runs away before they chop his head off. Sir Galahad finds the grail in a building filled with horny nuns but he is saved by the others before he spanks them. Sir Lancelot will save a prince before he gets married and he kills every guest at the wedding (funniest part of the movie) This would have been the most perfect movie if it wasn't for the ending where everyone gets arrested for killing a famous historian. That part upset me the most but I still love this film. Watch this and you'll change your mind about thinking Paul Blart Mall Cop is the funniest (like some people AKA my friend that I can't say the name of). I would say Monty Python and the Holy Grail is... "An Amazing Legendary Legend of some sorts"

    Before Holy Grail, the Pythons had not shown that long-form comedy was within their range. The longest sketches on their Flying Circus TV show, like "Scott of the Antarctic" or "The Piranha Brothers," ran at most ten or fifteen minutes. Terry Gilliam, unquestionably the sixth of the six main cast members, had filled some of the more outlandish bit parts in the show but was best known for creating its often-perverse animated sequences. Holy Grail changed all of that. The troupe's stock-in-trade, satirical setups that devolve almost instantly into absurdity, proved so adaptable to the feature-length format that Holy Grail became arguably their most widely-recognized and beloved work. Most of the individual vignettes, like the Black Knight and the witch- weighing scene, derive from the medieval setting, but the cadence of the delivery and the flair for wordplay are distinctly Pythonian. The film was also the springboard for Terry Gilliam's surprisingly-successful directorial career, and is a good example of his ability to create an off-kilter, vaguely-creepy atmosphere.

It wasn't funny at all and the ending was the worst ending i have ever seen in any movie, it was so stupid, i felt like stabbing needles in my eyes so i would become blind and never have to see that movie ever again. And the plot was a complete copy of Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull. The soundtrack was also very stupid, the entire movie didn't even have 10 songs and all the songs that were in the movie, no one would even know because they're so old, in fact, they're probably from even before 2008 or 2007! They should put songs in there that people actually recognize like maroon 5 songs and LMFAO songs! I would never recommend this movie to anyone.

    The one thing that I love about these Monty Python movies is not only how the humor can be quite farcical and outrageous, but that they are also quite realistic in it at times as well. One one hand you will have somebody blabbering on about nothing in particular and the film then cuts to shots of people crying out 'get on with it!'. Then there is the ongoing joke of the sparrow carrying a coconut which, when I first watched it, thought that it was some off handed remark made during the scene with the keeper of the bridge, until I realised that right at the beginning, when King Arthur first appears with his peasant banging two coconuts together, there is a discussion as to whether it is possible for a sparrow to carry a coconut to England (and there is another scene where a knight is attempting to tie a coconut to a sparrow to see if one can actually carry it). As for the realistic parts of it, they do a fantastic job with it as well. For instance when Arthur 'rides' through a town one of the peasants asks who he is and another says that he is the king, and the only reason that they think he is a king is because he is clean (I won't repeat what they actually said in the movie because IMDb will then not allow me to post this commentary). It is also interesting how a group of peasants don't even know the king when he rides up to them (and they starts sprouting out Marxist doctrine  Python loves to use anachronisms in the movie, and for some reason, actually get away with it). While it is humorous, it is also true because it is highly unlikely that in those days the peasants would actually know what the king looked like. As for the ending, well, that probably will go down in history as pretty much the most unexpected ending for a film to take. It simply comes completely out of left field, though it is not actually out of the blue because there are hints that it will be heading in that direction, but you still don't expect the police to rock up and proceed to arrest King Arthur and his Knights. Mind you when I saw Spamalot when I was in London I was actually very disappointed at the ending because, well, they actually found the Holy Grail. Okay, it was only 'based' on this film, but to be honest with you, I so prefer this movie than I did not musical (and am kicking myself that I did not go and see Rowan Atkinson). Oh, yeah, and I suspect that Tarantino may have picked up a thing or two with regards to the use of violence because some of the scenes in this movie are so Tarantino.

    Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a brilliant movie with a very stupid storyline that is just so funny that it's almost impossible not to love,especially when the cast is the lovable Monty Python crew,Graham Chapman,John Cleese,Eric Idle,Michael Palin,Terry Jones,Terry Gilliam all do a fantastic job in this movie as usual,their characters are hilarious and everything about this movie is so entertaining.A lot of people would say Life of Brian,but I think this is the best Monty Python movie,there are just so much memorable scenes and quotes in this movie (knights of the round table,the killer rabbit,knights who say ni,etc),all the Python movies are hilarious,but I think this one is the funniest,hands down.Fans of Monty Python and people who just have good taste in comedy will love this movie and like myself will be able to watch it again and again and laugh just as much each time. King Arthur heads off on a journey with his knights to Camelot,but when he decides not to go to Camelot because 'it is a silly place',they go and seek the Holy Grail,but a lot of obstacles get in their way.

We laugh a lot on it today too, we usually watch it again and again just like other films kind of this. The movie could make us to enjoy the older creations and later, when we got a bit old, found out the real meaning of the story and the scenes. If You watch it for the first time, then do search for some criticism. You will find out what is it all about, I'm sure. There are a lot of funny scenes and quotes that can fade the real messages but if you can see through this, not necessary for the first time.

As for the ending, well, that probably will go down in history as pretty much the most unexpected ending for a film to take. It simply comes completely out of left field, though it is not actually out of the blue because there are hints that it will be heading in that direction, but you still don't expect the police to rock up and proceed to arrest King Arthur and his Knights. Mind you when I saw Spamalot when I was in London I was actually very disappointed at the ending because, well, they actually found the Holy Grail. Okay, it was only 'based' on this film, but to be honest with you, I so prefer this movie than I did not musical (and am kicking myself that I did not go and see Rowan Atkinson). Oh, yeah, and I suspect that Tarantino may have picked up a thing or two with regards to the use of violence because some of the scenes in this movie are so Tarantino.

    Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a brilliant movie with a very stupid storyline that is just so funny that it's almost impossible not to love,especially when the cast is the lovable Monty Python crew,Graham Chapman,John Cleese,Eric Idle,Michael Palin,Terry Jones,Terry Gilliam all do a fantastic job in this movie as usual,their characters are hilarious and everything about this movie is so entertaining.A lot of people would say Life of Brian,but I think this is the best Monty Python movie,there are just so much memorable scenes and quotes in this movie (knights of the round table,the killer rabbit,knights who say ni,etc),all the Python movies are hilarious,but I think this one is the funniest,hands down.Fans of Monty Python and people who just have good taste in comedy will love this movie and like myself will be able to watch it again and again and laugh just as much each time. King Arthur heads off on a journey with his knights to Camelot,but when he decides not to go to Camelot because 'it is a silly place',they go and seek the Holy Grail,but a lot of obstacles get in their way.

    I am 16 years old and very proud of myself and my friends who grown up on these kind of films. We laugh a lot on it today too, we usually watch it again and again just like other films kind of this. The movie could make us to enjoy the older creations and later, when we got a bit old, found out the real meaning of the story and the scenes. If You watch it for the first time, then do search for some criticism. You will find out what is it all about, I'm sure. There are a lot of funny scenes and quotes that can fade the real messages but if you can see through this, not necessary for the first time. You don't have to search for it because it has a really different meaning if you don't want to search for more. It is not bad, it's just different. Funnier, light-minded.

    Monty Python and the Holy Grail is an overall great movie directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, starring the usual suspects in a Monty Python film such as Graham Champman, and John Cleese. In this film we find ourselves following our main character King Arthur (Graham Chapman) as he gathers his knights of the round table to embark on a quest to find the Holy Grail. The actors in this film defiantly DO NOT live up to any historical depiction of any king or knight that may have ever existed, but this is what we have come to love and expect out of the Monty Python crew. The style and theme of this film can only be described as cheap in the best sort of way. One would assume that in medieval times travel would mostly be done on horses, well Monty Python does not disappoint. No expense was speared when collecting the coconuts used to produce hoof sounds throughout the movie. That's right there are no horses in this movie, just men acting as if they were on horses while another man follows them around with coconuts. In conclusion I would have to say that following these men around on their adventure is definitely time well spent. I'll be watching this movie over and over, and will be getting just as much enjoyment out of it the hundredth time as I did the first.

    I absolutely loved this movie! It's got everything in it a comedian would be looking for. There is never a dull moment in "The Holy Grail". Graham Chapman plays a superb role as King Arthur alongside other great actors who flowed with the energy and excellent humor of this memorable film. Even though it is a ridiculous, nonsensical film (the killer rabbit, the crazy starting credits, and the ending should throw a thumbs up for that), it has a unique style that always get you laughing. Some of my favorite scenes in this movie (there are many) have to be the Bridge of Death scene (WHAT is your favorite color...WHAT is the capitol of Syria?), the killer rabbit, and the guards who have a hard time figuring out if they should leave the room or not (so we stay here and guard the prisoner...until you leave...and then we follow you. But wait, do we take him with us?). The comic geniuses behind this film deserve a lot of credit for putting in moments in the film that were not meant to be taken seriously or require much thought but just to make you sit back and think "Man, what are they going to do next? This is hilarious!". It's just a pure fun,entertaining comedy film that anyone of any age should enjoy. Too bad a lot of comedic films these days can't be like this one. Most have submitted to the layout standards of Hollywood films and some,incredibly ironic, don't know how to be funny or take themselves too seriously. Take a page out of Monty Python's play book. Any movie that features a gang of misfits embarking on a crazy journey that ends up nowhere(except in jail, I suppose) has got to be a real winner. Ni!

    What the Pythons did goes back to Dada in the 1910'sagainst logic and bourgeois complacency, for irrationality, chaos and the absurd as by-roads to unconscious inspiration. In this film, usually accepted as one of their best, they rail helter skelter against authority, masculine heroism, sexual hypocrisy, the chastity of romantic legend. Some of the skits work, the coconuts, duck, French siege. It's funny when it is, precisely because it's non-sense, a shrubbery of very smalls rocks. More often, it's just silly. The more of logic that is applied to explain say, coconuts in Britain, the more ludicrous logic appears to be, we recognize the truth of this in our own irrational world. But the overall film fails for my taste. It had two competing directors in Jones and Gilliam, this may account for some of it. But mostly, it is poor cinematic storytelling, one skit after the other. Even surrealism benefits from some overall framework for the experience, something to be directed to beyond reason. At the time, this wasn't as clear as it is now. The Czechs were still making movies in this disconnected vein, Svankmajer to this day. Late 60's Godard, more famously. All those things were very much in the counter-culture air in the 1970's. So as with most things of the era, this is fun for a while, fun but stale.

    In England in 932AD, King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table are charged with a sacred quest to find the Holy Grail of biblical legend. However, if they should doubt their courage or their strength, death awaits them all with nasty big pointy teeth ... Made for the vast sum of &pound;229,575, this comic cult classic is one of the funniest and most original movies ever made. The combination of the weird, zany, shocking, argumentative, stream-of-consciousness humour of the Monty Python troupe within the historical context of Arthurian legend is simply brilliant. The Pythons are able to simultaneously create a visually exciting movie of medieval times but then break all the rules about how such movies should play out. Typical example - the coconuts idea is a great visual joke based on budgetary limitations (they couldn't afford any horses) which they also turned into a hilarious opening scene where they bicker over the anachronistic existence of tropical fruit in Anglo-Saxon Britain. The movie is both great fun to watch in of itself, but also even more fun to laugh at as a satire of historical/action/period films in general (such as the "bad editing" joke when Sir Lancelot storms Swamp Castle). The dialogue is priceless throughout, with gags ranging from the cerebral to the gloriously offensive, but perhaps most importantly the film has a truly inspired sense of the visual - the Black Knight sequence, the Trojan Rabbit, the dreaded Cave Of Caerbannog, and many other great moments. This is the only Python movie directed by both the Terrys, and it combines the best qualities of Jones' character comedy with Gilliam's artist's perspective. If it has one limitation, it's that a few scenes feel like individual sketches within the larger film, but the episodic nature of the story covers this quite nicely. Everybody is terrific in it and Palin and Idle possibly win a joint award for most characters played in a feature, with at least seven speaking parts each. I especially like Gilliam as The Old Man From Scene 24. The Pythons only made four movies (five if you count the Hollywood Bowl concert), all of which are terrific but have different strengths and weaknesses. This one is perhaps the most fun and (despite its cult credentials) the most accessible, and is not to be missed. Shot mostly in Scotland, notably at Doune Castle in Perthshire and Castle Stalker in Argyll, this makes a great double-bill with John Boorman's Excalibur, but make sure you watch the Monty Python film second. And always remember, just walk away from any French people taunting you.

    Monty Python and the holy grail is somehow the funniest movie ever. I never saw his show but I hope it's funny as this. Join Arthur, King of the Britains, on his quest to Camelot (that quickly ends after a hysterical musical number). So instead join him on his quest to find the holy grail along with Brave Sir robin, Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad, and Sir not appearing in this film. Each will have a story in between their quest. Sir Robin will almost fight an annoying but funny 3-headed person, but he runs away before they chop his head off. Sir Galahad finds the grail in a building filled with horny nuns but he is saved by the others before he spanks them. Sir Lancelot will save a prince before he gets married and he kills every guest at the wedding (funniest part of the movie) This would have been the most perfect movie if it wasn't for the ending where everyone gets arrested for killing a famous historian. That part upset me the most but I still love this film. Watch this and you'll change your mind about thinking Paul Blart Mall Cop is the funniest (like some people AKA my friend that I can't say the name of). I would say Monty Python and the Holy Grail is... "An Amazing Legendary Legend of some sorts"

    Before Holy Grail, the Pythons had not shown that long-form comedy was within their range. The longest sketches on their Flying Circus TV show, like "Scott of the Antarctic" or "The Piranha Brothers," ran at most ten or fifteen minutes. Terry Gilliam, unquestionably the sixth of the six main cast members, had filled some of the more outlandish bit parts in the show but was best known for creating its often-perverse animated sequences. Holy Grail changed all of that. The troupe's stock-in-trade, satirical setups that devolve almost instantly into absurdity, proved so adaptable to the feature-length format that Holy Grail became arguably their most widely-recognized and beloved work. Most of the individual vignettes, like the Black Knight and the witch- weighing scene, derive from the medieval setting, but the cadence of the delivery and the flair for wordplay are distinctly Pythonian. The film was also the springboard for Terry Gilliam's surprisingly-successful directorial career, and is a good example of his ability to create an off-kilter, vaguely-creepy atmosphere.

    I do not understand why almost all of the IMDb user reviews give this movie 8 or more stars. It was terrible quality recording (NOT EVEN HD!) with unbelievably horrible effects. It wasn't funny at all and the ending was the worst ending i have ever seen in any movie, it was so stupid, i felt like stabbing needles in my eyes so i would become blind and never have to see that movie ever again. And the plot was a complete copy of Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull. The soundtrack was also very stupid, the entire movie didn't even have 10 songs and all the songs that were in the movie, no one would even know because they're so old, in fact, they're probably from even before 2008 or 2007! They should put songs in there that people actually recognize like maroon 5 songs and LMFAO songs! I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I regret watching it and i will never in my entire life regret typing this online review. WORST. COMEDY. EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!

    The one thing that I love about these Monty Python movies is not only how the humor can be quite farcical and outrageous, but that they are also quite realistic in it at times as well. One one hand you will have somebody blabbering on about nothing in particular and the film then cuts to shots of people crying out 'get on with it!'. Then there is the ongoing joke of the sparrow carrying a coconut which, when I first watched it, thought that it was some off handed remark made during the scene with the keeper of the bridge, until I realised that right at the beginning, when King Arthur first appears with his peasant banging two coconuts together, there is a discussion as to whether it is possible for a sparrow to carry a coconut to England (and there is another scene where a knight is attempting to tie a coconut to a sparrow to see if one can actually carry it). As for the realistic parts of it, they do a fantastic job with it as well. For instance when Arthur 'rides' through a town one of the peasants asks who he is and another says that he is the king, and the only reason that they think he is a king is because he is clean (I won't repeat what they actually said in the movie because IMDb will then not allow me to post this commentary). It is also interesting how a group of peasants don't even know the king when he rides up to them (and they starts sprouting out Marxist doctrine  Python loves to use anachronisms in the movie, and for some reason, actually get away with it). While it is humorous, it is also true because it is highly unlikely that in those days the peasants would actually know what the king looked like. As for the ending, well, that probably will go down in history as pretty much the most unexpected ending for a film to take. It simply comes completely out of left field, though it is not actually out of the blue because there are hints that it will be heading in that direction, but you still don't expect the police to rock up and proceed to arrest King Arthur and his Knights. Mind you when I saw Spamalot when I was in London I was actually very disappointed at the ending because, well, they actually found the Holy Grail. Okay, it was only 'based' on this film, but to be honest with you, I so prefer this movie than I did not musical (and am kicking myself that I did not go and see Rowan Atkinson). Oh, yeah, and I suspect that Tarantino may have picked up a thing or two with regards to the use of violence because some of the scenes in this movie are so Tarantino.

    I do not understand why almost all of the IMDb user reviews give this movie 8 or more stars. It was terrible quality recording (NOT EVEN HD!) with unbelievably horrible effects. It wasn't funny at all and the ending was the worst ending i have ever seen in any movie, it was so stupid, i felt like stabbing needles in my eyes so i would become blind and never have to see that movie ever again. And the plot was a complete copy of Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull. The soundtrack was also very stupid, the entire movie didn't even have 10 songs and all the songs that were in the movie, no one would even know because they're so old, in fact, they're probably from even before 2008 or 2007! They should put songs in there that people actually recognize like maroon 5 songs and LMFAO songs! I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I regret watching it and i will never in my entire life regret typing this online review. WORST. COMEDY. EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!

    The one thing that I love about these Monty Python movies is not only how the humor can be quite farcical and outrageous, but that they are also quite realistic in it at times as well. One one hand you will have somebody blabbering on about nothing in particular and the film then cuts to shots of people crying out 'get on with it!'. Then there is the ongoing joke of the sparrow carrying a coconut which, when I first watched it, thought that it was some off handed remark made during the scene with the keeper of the bridge, until I realised that right at the beginning, when King Arthur first appears with his peasant banging two coconuts together, there is a discussion as to whether it is possible for a sparrow to carry a coconut to England (and there is another scene where a knight is attempting to tie a coconut to a sparrow to see if one can actually carry it). As for the realistic parts of it, they do a fantastic job with it as well. For instance when Arthur 'rides' through a town one of the peasants asks who he is and another says that he is the king, and the only reason that they think he is a king is because he is clean (I won't repeat what they actually said in the movie because IMDb will then not allow me to post this commentary). It is also interesting how a group of peasants don't even know the king when he rides up to them (and they starts sprouting out Marxist doctrine  Python loves to use anachronisms in the movie, and for some reason, actually get away with it). While it is humorous, it is also true because it is highly unlikely that in those days the peasants would actually know what the king looked like. As for the ending, well, that probably will go down in history as pretty much the most unexpected ending for a film to take. It simply comes completely out of left field, though it is not actually out of the blue because there are hints that it will be heading in that direction, but you still don't expect the police to rock up and proceed to arrest King Arthur and his Knights. Mind you when I saw Spamalot when I was in London I was actually very disappointed at the ending because, well, they actually found the Holy Grail. Okay, it was only 'based' on this film, but to be honest with you, I so prefer this movie than I did not musical (and am kicking myself that I did not go and see Rowan Atkinson). Oh, yeah, and I suspect that Tarantino may have picked up a thing or two with regards to the use of violence because some of the scenes in this movie are so Tarantino.

    Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a brilliant movie with a very stupid storyline that is just so funny that it's almost impossible not to love,especially when the cast is the lovable Monty Python crew,Graham Chapman,John Cleese,Eric Idle,Michael Palin,Terry Jones,Terry Gilliam all do a fantastic job in this movie as usual,their characters are hilarious and everything about this movie is so entertaining.A lot of people would say Life of Brian,but I think this is the best Monty Python movie,there are just so much memorable scenes and quotes in this movie (knights of the round table,the killer rabbit,knights who say ni,etc),all the Python movies are hilarious,but I think this one is the funniest,hands down.Fans of Monty Python and people who just have good taste in comedy will love this movie and like myself will be able to watch it again and again and laugh just as much each time. King Arthur heads off on a journey with his knights to Camelot,but when he decides not to go to Camelot because 'it is a silly place',they go and seek the Holy Grail,but a lot of obstacles get in their way.

    I am 16 years old and very proud of myself and my friends who grown up on these kind of films. We laugh a lot on it today too, we usually watch it again and again just like other films kind of this. The movie could make us to enjoy the older creations and later, when we got a bit old, found out the real meaning of the story and the scenes. If You watch it for the first time, then do search for some criticism. You will find out what is it all about, I'm sure. There are a lot of funny scenes and quotes that can fade the real messages but if you can see through this, not necessary for the first time. You don't have to search for it because it has a really different meaning if you don't want to search for more. It is not bad, it's just different. Funnier, light-minded.

    Monty Python and the Holy Grail is an overall great movie directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, starring the usual suspects in a Monty Python film such as Graham Champman, and John Cleese. In this film we find ourselves following our main character King Arthur (Graham Chapman) as he gathers his knights of the round table to embark on a quest to find the Holy Grail. The actors in this film defiantly DO NOT live up to any historical depiction of any king or knight that may have ever existed, but this is what we have come to love and expect out of the Monty Python crew. The style and theme of this film can only be described as cheap in the best sort of way. One would assume that in medieval times travel would mostly be done on horses, well Monty Python does not disappoint. No expense was speared when collecting the coconuts used to produce hoof sounds throughout the movie. That's right there are no horses in this movie, just men acting as if they were on horses while another man follows them around with coconuts. In conclusion I would have to say that following these men around on their adventure is definitely time well spent. I'll be watching this movie over and over, and will be getting just as much enjoyment out of it the hundredth time as I did the first.

    I absolutely loved this movie! It's got everything in it a comedian would be looking for. There is never a dull moment in "The Holy Grail". Graham Chapman plays a superb role as King Arthur alongside other great actors who flowed with the energy and excellent humor of this memorable film. Even though it is a ridiculous, nonsensical film (the killer rabbit, the crazy starting credits, and the ending should throw a thumbs up for that), it has a unique style that always get you laughing. Some of my favorite scenes in this movie (there are many) have to be the Bridge of Death scene (WHAT is your favorite color...WHAT is the capitol of Syria?), the killer rabbit, and the guards who have a hard time figuring out if they should leave the room or not (so we stay here and guard the prisoner...until you leave...and then we follow you. But wait, do we take him with us?). The comic geniuses behind this film deserve a lot of credit for putting in moments in the film that were not meant to be taken seriously or require much thought but just to make you sit back and think "Man, what are they going to do next? This is hilarious!". It's just a pure fun,entertaining comedy film that anyone of any age should enjoy. Too bad a lot of comedic films these days can't be like this one. Most have submitted to the layout standards of Hollywood films and some,incredibly ironic, don't know how to be funny or take themselves too seriously. Take a page out of Monty Python's play book. Any movie that features a gang of misfits embarking on a crazy journey that ends up nowhere(except in jail, I suppose) has got to be a real winner. Ni!

    What the Pythons did goes back to Dada in the 1910'sagainst logic and bourgeois complacency, for irrationality, chaos and the absurd as by-roads to unconscious inspiration. In this film, usually accepted as one of their best, they rail helter skelter against authority, masculine heroism, sexual hypocrisy, the chastity of romantic legend. Some of the skits work, the coconuts, duck, French siege. It's funny when it is, precisely because it's non-sense, a shrubbery of very smalls rocks. More often, it's just silly. The more of logic that is applied to explain say, coconuts in Britain, the more ludicrous logic appears to be, we recognize the truth of this in our own irrational world. But the overall film fails for my taste. It had two competing directors in Jones and Gilliam, this may account for some of it. But mostly, it is poor cinematic storytelling, one skit after the other. Even surrealism benefits from some overall framework for the experience, something to be directed to beyond reason. At the time, this wasn't as clear as it is now. The Czechs were still making movies in this disconnected vein, Svankmajer to this day. Late 60's Godard, more famously. All those things were very much in the counter-culture air in the 1970's. So as with most things of the era, this is fun for a while, fun but stale.

    In England in 932AD, King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table are charged with a sacred quest to find the Holy Grail of biblical legend. However, if they should doubt their courage or their strength, death awaits them all with nasty big pointy teeth ... Made for the vast sum of &pound;229,575, this comic cult classic is one of the funniest and most original movies ever made. The combination of the weird, zany, shocking, argumentative, stream-of-consciousness humour of the Monty Python troupe within the historical context of Arthurian legend is simply brilliant. The Pythons are able to simultaneously create a visually exciting movie of medieval times but then break all the rules about how such movies should play out. Typical example - the coconuts idea is a great visual joke based on budgetary limitations (they couldn't afford any horses) which they also turned into a hilarious opening scene where they bicker over the anachronistic existence of tropical fruit in Anglo-Saxon Britain. The movie is both great fun to watch in of itself, but also even more fun to laugh at as a satire of historical/action/period films in general (such as the "bad editing" joke when Sir Lancelot storms Swamp Castle). The dialogue is priceless throughout, with gags ranging from the cerebral to the gloriously offensive, but perhaps most importantly the film has a truly inspired sense of the visual - the Black Knight sequence, the Trojan Rabbit, the dreaded Cave Of Caerbannog, and many other great moments. This is the only Python movie directed by both the Terrys, and it combines the best qualities of Jones' character comedy with Gilliam's artist's perspective. If it has one limitation, it's that a few scenes feel like individual sketches within the larger film, but the episodic nature of the story covers this quite nicely. Everybody is terrific in it and Palin and Idle possibly win a joint award for most characters played in a feature, with at least seven speaking parts each. I especially like Gilliam as The Old Man From Scene 24. The Pythons only made four movies (five if you count the Hollywood Bowl concert), all of which are terrific but have different strengths and weaknesses. This one is perhaps the most fun and (despite its cult credentials) the most accessible, and is not to be missed. Shot mostly in Scotland, notably at Doune Castle in Perthshire and Castle Stalker in Argyll, this makes a great double-bill with John Boorman's Excalibur, but make sure you watch the Monty Python film second. And always remember, just walk away from any French people taunting you.

    Monty Python and the holy grail is somehow the funniest movie ever. I never saw his show but I hope it's funny as this. Join Arthur, King of the Britains, on his quest to Camelot (that quickly ends after a hysterical musical number). So instead join him on his quest to find the holy grail along with Brave Sir robin, Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad, and Sir not appearing in this film. Each will have a story in between their quest. Sir Robin will almost fight an annoying but funny 3-headed person, but he runs away before they chop his head off. Sir Galahad finds the grail in a building filled with horny nuns but he is saved by the others before he spanks them. Sir Lancelot will save a prince before he gets married and he kills every guest at the wedding (funniest part of the movie) This would have been the most perfect movie if it wasn't for the ending where everyone gets arrested for killing a famous historian. That part upset me the most but I still love this film. Watch this and you'll change your mind about thinking Paul Blart Mall Cop is the funniest (like some people AKA my friend that I can't say the name of). I would say Monty Python and the Holy Grail is... "An Amazing Legendary Legend of some sorts"

    Before Holy Grail, the Pythons had not shown that long-form comedy was within their range. The longest sketches on their Flying Circus TV show, like "Scott of the Antarctic" or "The Piranha Brothers," ran at most ten or fifteen minutes. Terry Gilliam, unquestionably the sixth of the six main cast members, had filled some of the more outlandish bit parts in the show but was best known for creating its often-perverse animated sequences. Holy Grail changed all of that. The troupe's stock-in-trade, satirical setups that devolve almost instantly into absurdity, proved so adaptable to the feature-length format that Holy Grail became arguably their most widely-recognized and beloved work. Most of the individual vignettes, like the Black Knight and the witch- weighing scene, derive from the medieval setting, but the cadence of the delivery and the flair for wordplay are distinctly Pythonian. The film was also the springboard for Terry Gilliam's surprisingly-successful directorial career, and is a good example of his ability to create an off-kilter, vaguely-creepy atmosphere.

    I do not understand why almost all of the IMDb user reviews give this movie 8 or more stars. It was terrible quality recording (NOT EVEN HD!) with unbelievably horrible effects. It wasn't funny at all and the ending was the worst ending i have ever seen in any movie, it was so stupid, i felt like stabbing needles in my eyes so i would become blind and never have to see that movie ever again. And the plot was a complete copy of Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull. The soundtrack was also very stupid, the entire movie didn't even have 10 songs and all the songs that were in the movie, no one would even know because they're so old, in fact, they're probably from even before 2008 or 2007! They should put songs in there that people actually recognize like maroon 5 songs and LMFAO songs! I would never recommend this movie to anyone.

One one hand you will have somebody blabbering on about nothing in particular and the film then cuts to shots of people crying out 'get on with it!'. Then there is the ongoing joke of the sparrow carrying a coconut which, when I first watched it, thought that it was some off handed remark made during the scene with the keeper of the bridge, until I realised that right at the beginning, when King Arthur first appears with his peasant banging two coconuts together, there is a discussion as to whether it is possible for a sparrow to carry a coconut to England (and there is another scene where a knight is attempting to tie a coconut to a sparrow to see if one can actually carry it).

    Monty Python and the holy grail is somehow the funniest movie ever. I never saw his show but I hope it's funny as this. Join Arthur, King of the Britains, on his quest to Camelot (that quickly ends after a hysterical musical number). So instead join him on his quest to find the holy grail along with Brave Sir robin, Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad, and Sir not appearing in this film. Each will have a story in between their quest. Sir Robin will almost fight an annoying but funny 3-headed person, but he runs away before they chop his head off. Sir Galahad finds the grail in a building filled with horny nuns but he is saved by the others before he spanks them. Sir Lancelot will save a prince before he gets married and he kills every guest at the wedding (funniest part of the movie) This would have been the most perfect movie if it wasn't for the ending where everyone gets arrested for killing a famous historian. That part upset me the most but I still love this film. Watch this and you'll change your mind about thinking Paul Blart Mall Cop is the funniest (like some people AKA my friend that I can't say the name of). I would say Monty Python and the Holy Grail is... "An Amazing Legendary Legend of some sorts"

    Before Holy Grail, the Pythons had not shown that long-form comedy was within their range. The longest sketches on their Flying Circus TV show, like "Scott of the Antarctic" or "The Piranha Brothers," ran at most ten or fifteen minutes. Terry Gilliam, unquestionably the sixth of the six main cast members, had filled some of the more outlandish bit parts in the show but was best known for creating its often-perverse animated sequences. Holy Grail changed all of that. The troupe's stock-in-trade, satirical setups that devolve almost instantly into absurdity, proved so adaptable to the feature-length format that Holy Grail became arguably their most widely-recognized and beloved work. Most of the individual vignettes, like the Black Knight and the witch- weighing scene, derive from the medieval setting, but the cadence of the delivery and the flair for wordplay are distinctly Pythonian. The film was also the springboard for Terry Gilliam's surprisingly-successful directorial career, and is a good example of his ability to create an off-kilter, vaguely-creepy atmosphere.

    I do not understand why almost all of the IMDb user reviews give this movie 8 or more stars. It was terrible quality recording (NOT EVEN HD!) with unbelievably horrible effects. It wasn't funny at all and the ending was the worst ending i have ever seen in any movie, it was so stupid, i felt like stabbing needles in my eyes so i would become blind and never have to see that movie ever again. And the plot was a complete copy of Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull. The soundtrack was also very stupid, the entire movie didn't even have 10 songs and all the songs that were in the movie, no one would even know because they're so old, in fact, they're probably from even before 2008 or 2007! They should put songs in there that people actually recognize like maroon 5 songs and LMFAO songs! I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I regret watching it and i will never in my entire life regret typing this online review. WORST. COMEDY. EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!

    The one thing that I love about these Monty Python movies is not only how the humor can be quite farcical and outrageous, but that they are also quite realistic in it at times as well. One one hand you will have somebody blabbering on about nothing in particular and the film then cuts to shots of people crying out 'get on with it!'. Then there is the ongoing joke of the sparrow carrying a coconut which, when I first watched it, thought that it was some off handed remark made during the scene with the keeper of the bridge, until I realised that right at the beginning, when King Arthur first appears with his peasant banging two coconuts together, there is a discussion as to whether it is possible for a sparrow to carry a coconut to England (and there is another scene where a knight is attempting to tie a coconut to a sparrow to see if one can actually carry it). As for the realistic parts of it, they do a fantastic job with it as well. For instance when Arthur 'rides' through a town one of the peasants asks who he is and another says that he is the king, and the only reason that they think he is a king is because he is clean (I won't repeat what they actually said in the movie because IMDb will then not allow me to post this commentary). It is also interesting how a group of peasants don't even know the king when he rides up to them (and they starts sprouting out Marxist doctrine  Python loves to use anachronisms in the movie, and for some reason, actually get away with it). While it is humorous, it is also true because it is highly unlikely that in those days the peasants would actually know what the king looked like. As for the ending, well, that probably will go down in history as pretty much the most unexpected ending for a film to take. It simply comes completely out of left field, though it is not actually out of the blue because there are hints that it will be heading in that direction, but you still don't expect the police to rock up and proceed to arrest King Arthur and his Knights. Mind you when I saw Spamalot when I was in London I was actually very disappointed at the ending because, well, they actually found the Holy Grail. Okay, it was only 'based' on this film, but to be honest with you, I so prefer this movie than I did not musical (and am kicking myself that I did not go and see Rowan Atkinson). Oh, yeah, and I suspect that Tarantino may have picked up a thing or two with regards to the use of violence because some of the scenes in this movie are so Tarantino.

    Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a brilliant movie with a very stupid storyline that is just so funny that it's almost impossible not to love,especially when the cast is the lovable Monty Python crew,Graham Chapman,John Cleese,Eric Idle,Michael Palin,Terry Jones,Terry Gilliam all do a fantastic job in this movie as usual,their characters are hilarious and everything about this movie is so entertaining.A lot of people would say Life of Brian,but I think this is the best Monty Python movie,there are just so much memorable scenes and quotes in this movie (knights of the round table,the killer rabbit,knights who say ni,etc),all the Python movies are hilarious,but I think this one is the funniest,hands down.Fans of Monty Python and people who just have good taste in comedy will love this movie and like myself will be able to watch it again and again and laugh just as much each time. King Arthur heads off on a journey with his knights to Camelot,but when he decides not to go to Camelot because 'it is a silly place',they go and seek the Holy Grail,but a lot of obstacles get in their way.

    I am 16 years old and very proud of myself and my friends who grown up on these kind of films. We laugh a lot on it today too, we usually watch it again and again just like other films kind of this. The movie could make us to enjoy the older creations and later, when we got a bit old, found out the real meaning of the story and the scenes. If You watch it for the first time, then do search for some criticism. You will find out what is it all about, I'm sure. There are a lot of funny scenes and quotes that can fade the real messages but if you can see through this, not necessary for the first time. You don't have to search for it because it has a really different meaning if you don't want to search for more. It is not bad, it's just different. Funnier, light-minded.

    Monty Python and the Holy Grail is an overall great movie directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, starring the usual suspects in a Monty Python film such as Graham Champman, and John Cleese. In this film we find ourselves following our main character King Arthur (Graham Chapman) as he gathers his knights of the round table to embark on a quest to find the Holy Grail. The actors in this film defiantly DO NOT live up to any historical depiction of any king or knight that may have ever existed, but this is what we have come to love and expect out of the Monty Python crew. The style and theme of this film can only be described as cheap in the best sort of way. One would assume that in medieval times travel would mostly be done on horses, well Monty Python does not disappoint. No expense was speared when collecting the coconuts used to produce hoof sounds throughout the movie. That's right there are no horses in this movie, just men acting as if they were on horses while another man follows them around with coconuts. In conclusion I would have to say that following these men around on their adventure is definitely time well spent. I'll be watching this movie over and over, and will be getting just as much enjoyment out of it the hundredth time as I did the first.

    I absolutely loved this movie! It's got everything in it a comedian would be looking for. There is never a dull moment in "The Holy Grail". Graham Chapman plays a superb role as King Arthur alongside other great actors who flowed with the energy and excellent humor of this memorable film. Even though it is a ridiculous, nonsensical film (the killer rabbit, the crazy starting credits, and the ending should throw a thumbs up for that), it has a unique style that always get you laughing. Some of my favorite scenes in this movie (there are many) have to be the Bridge of Death scene (WHAT is your favorite color...WHAT is the capitol of Syria?), the killer rabbit, and the guards who have a hard time figuring out if they should leave the room or not (so we stay here and guard the prisoner...until you leave...and then we follow you. But wait, do we take him with us?). The comic geniuses behind this film deserve a lot of credit for putting in moments in the film that were not meant to be taken seriously or require much thought but just to make you sit back and think "Man, what are they going to do next? This is hilarious!". It's just a pure fun,entertaining comedy film that anyone of any age should enjoy. Too bad a lot of comedic films these days can't be like this one. Most have submitted to the layout standards of Hollywood films and some,incredibly ironic, don't know how to be funny or take themselves too seriously. Take a page out of Monty Python's play book. Any movie that features a gang of misfits embarking on a crazy journey that ends up nowhere(except in jail, I suppose) has got to be a real winner. Ni!

    What the Pythons did goes back to Dada in the 1910'sagainst logic and bourgeois complacency, for irrationality, chaos and the absurd as by-roads to unconscious inspiration. In this film, usually accepted as one of their best, they rail helter skelter against authority, masculine heroism, sexual hypocrisy, the chastity of romantic legend. Some of the skits work, the coconuts, duck, French siege. It's funny when it is, precisely because it's non-sense, a shrubbery of very smalls rocks. More often, it's just silly. The more of logic that is applied to explain say, coconuts in Britain, the more ludicrous logic appears to be, we recognize the truth of this in our own irrational world. But the overall film fails for my taste. It had two competing directors in Jones and Gilliam, this may account for some of it. But mostly, it is poor cinematic storytelling, one skit after the other. Even surrealism benefits from some overall framework for the experience, something to be directed to beyond reason. At the time, this wasn't as clear as it is now. The Czechs were still making movies in this disconnected vein, Svankmajer to this day. Late 60's Godard, more famously. All those things were very much in the counter-culture air in the 1970's. So as with most things of the era, this is fun for a while, fun but stale.

    In England in 932AD, King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table are charged with a sacred quest to find the Holy Grail of biblical legend. However, if they should doubt their courage or their strength, death awaits them all with nasty big pointy teeth ... Made for the vast sum of &pound;229,575, this comic cult classic is one of the funniest and most original movies ever made. The combination of the weird, zany, shocking, argumentative, stream-of-consciousness humour of the Monty Python troupe within the historical context of Arthurian legend is simply brilliant. The Pythons are able to simultaneously create a visually exciting movie of medieval times but then break all the rules about how such movies should play out. Typical example - the coconuts idea is a great visual joke based on budgetary limitations (they couldn't afford any horses) which they also turned into a hilarious opening scene where they bicker over the anachronistic existence of tropical fruit in Anglo-Saxon Britain. The movie is both great fun to watch in of itself, but also even more fun to laugh at as a satire of historical/action/period films in general (such as the "bad editing" joke when Sir Lancelot storms Swamp Castle). The dialogue is priceless throughout, with gags ranging from the cerebral to the gloriously offensive, but perhaps most importantly the film has a truly inspired sense of the visual - the Black Knight sequence, the Trojan Rabbit, the dreaded Cave Of Caerbannog, and many other great moments. This is the only Python movie directed by both the Terrys, and it combines the best qualities of Jones' character comedy with Gilliam's artist's perspective. If it has one limitation, it's that a few scenes feel like individual sketches within the larger film, but the episodic nature of the story covers this quite nicely. Everybody is terrific in it and Palin and Idle possibly win a joint award for most characters played in a feature, with at least seven speaking parts each. I especially like Gilliam as The Old Man From Scene 24. The Pythons only made four movies (five if you count the Hollywood Bowl concert), all of which are terrific but have different strengths and weaknesses. This one is perhaps the most fun and (despite its cult credentials) the most accessible, and is not to be missed. Shot mostly in Scotland, notably at Doune Castle in Perthshire and Castle Stalker in Argyll, this makes a great double-bill with John Boorman's Excalibur, but make sure you watch the Monty Python film second. And always remember, just walk away from any French people taunting you.

    Before Holy Grail, the Pythons had not shown that long-form comedy was within their range. The longest sketches on their Flying Circus TV show, like "Scott of the Antarctic" or "The Piranha Brothers," ran at most ten or fifteen minutes. Terry Gilliam, unquestionably the sixth of the six main cast members, had filled some of the more outlandish bit parts in the show but was best known for creating its often-perverse animated sequences. Holy Grail changed all of that. The troupe's stock-in-trade, satirical setups that devolve almost instantly into absurdity, proved so adaptable to the feature-length format that Holy Grail became arguably their most widely-recognized and beloved work. Most of the individual vignettes, like the Black Knight and the witch- weighing scene, derive from the medieval setting, but the cadence of the delivery and the flair for wordplay are distinctly Pythonian. The film was also the springboard for Terry Gilliam's surprisingly-successful directorial career, and is a good example of his ability to create an off-kilter, vaguely-creepy atmosphere.

    In England in 932AD, King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table are charged with a sacred quest to find the Holy Grail of biblical legend. However, if they should doubt their courage or their strength, death awaits them all with nasty big pointy teeth ... Made for the vast sum of &pound;229,575, this comic cult classic is one of the funniest and most original movies ever made. The combination of the weird, zany, shocking, argumentative, stream-of-consciousness humour of the Monty Python troupe within the historical context of Arthurian legend is simply brilliant. The Pythons are able to simultaneously create a visually exciting movie of medieval times but then break all the rules about how such movies should play out. Typical example - the coconuts idea is a great visual joke based on budgetary limitations (they couldn't afford any horses) which they also turned into a hilarious opening scene where they bicker over the anachronistic existence of tropical fruit in Anglo-Saxon Britain. The movie is both great fun to watch in of itself, but also even more fun to laugh at as a satire of historical/action/period films in general (such as the "bad editing" joke when Sir Lancelot storms Swamp Castle). The dialogue is priceless throughout, with gags ranging from the cerebral to the gloriously offensive, but perhaps most importantly the film has a truly inspired sense of the visual - the Black Knight sequence, the Trojan Rabbit, the dreaded Cave Of Caerbannog, and many other great moments. This is the only Python movie directed by both the Terrys, and it combines the best qualities of Jones' character comedy with Gilliam's artist's perspective. If it has one limitation, it's that a few scenes feel like individual sketches within the larger film, but the episodic nature of the story covers this quite nicely. Everybody is terrific in it and Palin and Idle possibly win a joint award for most characters played in a feature, with at least seven speaking parts each. I especially like Gilliam as The Old Man From Scene 24. The Pythons only made four movies (five if you count the Hollywood Bowl concert), all of which are terrific but have different strengths and weaknesses. This one is perhaps the most fun and (despite its cult credentials) the most accessible, and is not to be missed. Shot mostly in Scotland, notably at Doune Castle in Perthshire and Castle Stalker in Argyll, this makes a great double-bill with John Boorman's Excalibur, but make sure you watch the Monty Python film second. And always remember, just walk away from any French people taunting you.

    Monty Python and the holy grail is somehow the funniest movie ever. I never saw his show but I hope it's funny as this. Join Arthur, King of the Britains, on his quest to Camelot (that quickly ends after a hysterical musical number). So instead join him on his quest to find the holy grail along with Brave Sir robin, Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad, and Sir not appearing in this film. Each will have a story in between their quest. Sir Robin will almost fight an annoying but funny 3-headed person, but he runs away before they chop his head off. Sir Galahad finds the grail in a building filled with horny nuns but he is saved by the others before he spanks them. Sir Lancelot will save a prince before he gets married and he kills every guest at the wedding (funniest part of the movie) This would have been the most perfect movie if it wasn't for the ending where everyone gets arrested for killing a famous historian. That part upset me the most but I still love this film. Watch this and you'll change your mind about thinking Paul Blart Mall Cop is the funniest (like some people AKA my friend that I can't say the name of). I would say Monty Python and the Holy Grail is... "An Amazing Legendary Legend of some sorts"

    Before Holy Grail, the Pythons had not shown that long-form comedy was within their range. The longest sketches on their Flying Circus TV show, like "Scott of the Antarctic" or "The Piranha Brothers," ran at most ten or fifteen minutes. Terry Gilliam, unquestionably the sixth of the six main cast members, had filled some of the more outlandish bit parts in the show but was best known for creating its often-perverse animated sequences. Holy Grail changed all of that. The troupe's stock-in-trade, satirical setups that devolve almost instantly into absurdity, proved so adaptable to the feature-length format that Holy Grail became arguably their most widely-recognized and beloved work. Most of the individual vignettes, like the Black Knight and the witch- weighing scene, derive from the medieval setting, but the cadence of the delivery and the flair for wordplay are distinctly Pythonian. The film was also the springboard for Terry Gilliam's surprisingly-successful directorial career, and is a good example of his ability to create an off-kilter, vaguely-creepy atmosphere.

    I do not understand why almost all of the IMDb user reviews give this movie 8 or more stars. It was terrible quality recording (NOT EVEN HD!) with unbelievably horrible effects. It wasn't funny at all and the ending was the worst ending i have ever seen in any movie, it was so stupid, i felt like stabbing needles in my eyes so i would become blind and never have to see that movie ever again. And the plot was a complete copy of Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull. The soundtrack was also very stupid, the entire movie didn't even have 10 songs and all the songs that were in the movie, no one would even know because they're so old, in fact, they're probably from even before 2008 or 2007! They should put songs in there that people actually recognize like maroon 5 songs and LMFAO songs! I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I regret watching it and i will never in my entire life regret typing this online review. WORST. COMEDY. EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!

    The one thing that I love about these Monty Python movies is not only how the humor can be quite farcical and outrageous, but that they are also quite realistic in it at times as well. One one hand you will have somebody blabbering on about nothing in particular and the film then cuts to shots of people crying out 'get on with it!'. Then there is the ongoing joke of the sparrow carrying a coconut which, when I first watched it, thought that it was some off handed remark made during the scene with the keeper of the bridge, until I realised that right at the beginning, when King Arthur first appears with his peasant banging two coconuts together, there is a discussion as to whether it is possible for a sparrow to carry a coconut to England (and there is another scene where a knight is attempting to tie a coconut to a sparrow to see if one can actually carry it). As for the realistic parts of it, they do a fantastic job with it as well. For instance when Arthur 'rides' through a town one of the peasants asks who he is and another says that he is the king, and the only reason that they think he is a king is because he is clean (I won't repeat what they actually said in the movie because IMDb will then not allow me to post this commentary). It is also interesting how a group of peasants don't even know the king when he rides up to them (and they starts sprouting out Marxist doctrine  Python loves to use anachronisms in the movie, and for some reason, actually get away with it). While it is humorous, it is also true because it is highly unlikely that in those days the peasants would actually know what the king looked like. As for the ending, well, that probably will go down in history as pretty much the most unexpected ending for a film to take. It simply comes completely out of left field, though it is not actually out of the blue because there are hints that it will be heading in that direction, but you still don't expect the police to rock up and proceed to arrest King Arthur and his Knights. Mind you when I saw Spamalot when I was in London I was actually very disappointed at the ending because, well, they actually found the Holy Grail. Okay, it was only 'based' on this film, but to be honest with you, I so prefer this movie than I did not musical (and am kicking myself that I did not go and see Rowan Atkinson). Oh, yeah, and I suspect that Tarantino may have picked up a thing or two with regards to the use of violence because some of the scenes in this movie are so Tarantino.

    Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a brilliant movie with a very stupid storyline that is just so funny that it's almost impossible not to love,especially when the cast is the lovable Monty Python crew,Graham Chapman,John Cleese,Eric Idle,Michael Palin,Terry Jones,Terry Gilliam all do a fantastic job in this movie as usual,their characters are hilarious and everything about this movie is so entertaining.A lot of people would say Life of Brian,but I think this is the best Monty Python movie,there are just so much memorable scenes and quotes in this movie (knights of the round table,the killer rabbit,knights who say ni,etc),all the Python movies are hilarious,but I think this one is the funniest,hands down.Fans of Monty Python and people who just have good taste in comedy will love this movie and like myself will be able to watch it again and again and laugh just as much each time. King Arthur heads off on a journey with his knights to Camelot,but when he decides not to go to Camelot because 'it is a silly place',they go and seek the Holy Grail,but a lot of obstacles get in their way.

    I am 16 years old and very proud of myself and my friends who grown up on these kind of films. We laugh a lot on it today too, we usually watch it again and again just like other films kind of this. The movie could make us to enjoy the older creations and later, when we got a bit old, found out the real meaning of the story and the scenes. If You watch it for the first time, then do search for some criticism. You will find out what is it all about, I'm sure. There are a lot of funny scenes and quotes that can fade the real messages but if you can see through this, not necessary for the first time. You don't have to search for it because it has a really different meaning if you don't want to search for more. It is not bad, it's just different. Funnier, light-minded.

    Monty Python and the Holy Grail is an overall great movie directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, starring the usual suspects in a Monty Python film such as Graham Champman, and John Cleese. In this film we find ourselves following our main character King Arthur (Graham Chapman) as he gathers his knights of the round table to embark on a quest to find the Holy Grail. The actors in this film defiantly DO NOT live up to any historical depiction of any king or knight that may have ever existed, but this is what we have come to love and expect out of the Monty Python crew. The style and theme of this film can only be described as cheap in the best sort of way. One would assume that in medieval times travel would mostly be done on horses, well Monty Python does not disappoint. No expense was speared when collecting the coconuts used to produce hoof sounds throughout the movie. That's right there are no horses in this movie, just men acting as if they were on horses while another man follows them around with coconuts. In conclusion I would have to say that following these men around on their adventure is definitely time well spent. I'll be watching this movie over and over, and will be getting just as much enjoyment out of it the hundredth time as I did the first.

    I absolutely loved this movie! It's got everything in it a comedian would be looking for. There is never a dull moment in "The Holy Grail". Graham Chapman plays a superb role as King Arthur alongside other great actors who flowed with the energy and excellent humor of this memorable film. Even though it is a ridiculous, nonsensical film (the killer rabbit, the crazy starting credits, and the ending should throw a thumbs up for that), it has a unique style that always get you laughing. Some of my favorite scenes in this movie (there are many) have to be the Bridge of Death scene (WHAT is your favorite color...WHAT is the capitol of Syria?), the killer rabbit, and the guards who have a hard time figuring out if they should leave the room or not (so we stay here and guard the prisoner...until you leave...and then we follow you. But wait, do we take him with us?). The comic geniuses behind this film deserve a lot of credit for putting in moments in the film that were not meant to be taken seriously or require much thought but just to make you sit back and think "Man, what are they going to do next? This is hilarious!". It's just a pure fun,entertaining comedy film that anyone of any age should enjoy. Too bad a lot of comedic films these days can't be like this one. Most have submitted to the layout standards of Hollywood films and some,incredibly ironic, don't know how to be funny or take themselves too seriously. Take a page out of Monty Python's play book. Any movie that features a gang of misfits embarking on a crazy journey that ends up nowhere(except in jail, I suppose) has got to be a real winner. Ni!

    What the Pythons did goes back to Dada in the 1910'sagainst logic and bourgeois complacency, for irrationality, chaos and the absurd as by-roads to unconscious inspiration. In this film, usually accepted as one of their best, they rail helter skelter against authority, masculine heroism, sexual hypocrisy, the chastity of romantic legend. Some of the skits work, the coconuts, duck, French siege. It's funny when it is, precisely because it's non-sense, a shrubbery of very smalls rocks. More often, it's just silly. The more of logic that is applied to explain say, coconuts in Britain, the more ludicrous logic appears to be, we recognize the truth of this in our own irrational world. But the overall film fails for my taste. It had two competing directors in Jones and Gilliam, this may account for some of it. But mostly, it is poor cinematic storytelling, one skit after the other. Even surrealism benefits from some overall framework for the experience, something to be directed to beyond reason. At the time, this wasn't as clear as it is now. The Czechs were still making movies in this disconnected vein, Svankmajer to this day. Late 60's Godard, more famously. All those things were very much in the counter-culture air in the 1970's. So as with most things of the era, this is fun for a while, fun but stale.
