    Watchable if nothing else, this Whoopi Goldberg vehicle doesn't reach for the stars, but instead weaves social commentary on the glass ceiling and racial prejudice into the comedy of a business whiz (Goldberg) who invents a fictitious business partner when she finds she can't advance on her own merits, apparently due to her gender and race. But the ruse becomes difficult to manage as various investors demand to meet the elusive "Mr Cutty", and Goldberg resorts to costumes and well-staged theatrics to hide the fact that Cutty doesn't exist. Reasonable supporting cast features Tim Daly as a sleazy corporate type, ubiquitous to just about every film that depicts 'corporate America', Dianne Wiest as Goldberg's chronically under-appreciated right-hand woman, Eli Wallach as an old-school investor keen to meet the elusive Mr Cutty, and Austin Pendleton as a bookish inventor and CEO on the brink of bankruptcy until Goldberg can restore his standing. Blink and you'll miss Colleen Camp in a very minor role as a detective. Occasional slapstick and farce, fused with the usual dry-wit for which Goldberg is accustomed, it's a studio picture with all the typical hooks and clich&eacute;s, nevertheless, very mild and satisfying. And as a footnote, good to see Bebe Neuwirth in a particularly sultry role as an all-too-eager business associate to Wallach; she has a couple of scenes sans most of her wardrobe that are quite revealing.

    I'm surprised this film wasn't a bit more successful (it lost a ton of money) and better regarded than the rating it gets here. Overall, I enjoyed it. I thought Whoopi Goldberg was great as a struggling and then successful financial adviser. I wasn't clear -- was that her as Robert Cutty, or a stand-in? A real treasure here is the supporting part by Diane Weist as the secretary. Every time I see her I think what a treasure she is. The other supporting actors do their jobs, but hardly stand out. It is nice to see Eli Wallach as a rich businessman...he was 80 when he made this film, and although always a supporting actor, he always did a fine job. Tim Daly was appropriately sleazy in his role. And, it was nice to see Bebe Neuwirth (who most people recognize as Frazier Crane's wife) in a different part. Overall, the plot was handled nicely, with the overarching moral lesson being that in all walks of life there will be people who are inherently talented, but sometimes go unrecognized if they don't fit the usual racial (or other) pattern. The one part of the plot where things sort of fell apart was Robert Cutty's appearance at the hotel; this was sloppy and just didn't feel right. And blowing him up in a car -- the man who didn't even exist -- also seemed a bit slapstickish. But aside from those two areas, the script was pretty good. No, it's not the greatest comedy film ever made, but it's pretty decent and had a good moral point. Recommended, though it may not find its way to your DVD shelf.

    No, this is not from a John Grisham novel. An ambitious young black woman (Goldberg) tries to establish her own Wall Street investment firm, but quickly finds the business is part of the old boys' club. In order to get anyone to listen to her, she invents a male partner who always seems to be out of the office. This gets her into all sorts of jams. Director Donald Petrie wisely keeps Goldberg ducking and dodging all sorts of sticky situations for the first half, before having her slap on white face and a fat suit to pose as her imaginary partner in the second half. Dianne Wiest is wonderful as her mousy but very bright assistant, and the best parts of the movie are the scenes involving the two women. Bebe Nuewerth has a funny role as a corporate seductress, and Eli Wallach is a wealthy businessman eager to deal with Goldberg's firm but only if he can meet her partner. Tim Daly and Austin Pendleton add to the merriment as, respectively, Goldberg's ex-boss and a Bill Gates type. The movie walks a fine line between social commentary and laughs, and was shot in New York and New Jersey during winter, which gives the film a much more realistic look considering the absurdity of the premise.

    I always enjoy Whoopi Goldberg in films, and the 1996 film "The Associate" is no exception. Based on a French film, it's the story of a Laurel Ayres (Goldberg) who is having trouble "making it" in a man's world, though she's smarter than all of them. After being manipulated and beaten out of a promotion by at her old job by slick Frank (Tim Daly), Laurel starts her own company and quickly goes nowhere. She gets some help from an assistant at the old firm, Sally (Diane Wiest) and ultimately decides to make up a male associate, Robert Cutty. It works like a charm, and business is flying in the door. However, everyone is most anxious to meet Cutty, and there comes a point when she has to produce him. This is an amusing film that could have been hilarious. It does have some great moments, though, and likable characters in Goldberg and Wiest. Other fine performances include those of Daly, Lainie Kazan as a cutting columnist and Eli Wallach as a client. The other problem I have with the film is that it is sorely dated. It's hard to believe that, while sexism still exists, Laurel would have so much trouble from the old boys' network in 1996. Sure enough, as I suspected, the film on which it is based was done in 1979. Remington Steele, a TV series based on the same premise, was produced in the '80s. Surely in 1996, a woman of Laurel's obvious talent would have been more appreciated where she worked and could have launched a successful business without a fake male associate. Anne Mulcahy of Xerox and Ho Ching of Temasek Holdings are only two examples of such powerful executives from the 1990s.

    Whoopi Goldberg feels held back by her gender, so she gets a makeover as a man to jump start her ad agency. A lot of women defend this movie, but it seems like they should be insulted. Goldberg is reduced to getting fashion tips from a drag queen(man), getting inside tips from a mouse(man), and looking like a demented John Adams when she is remade as a white man. The movie would be really empowering if she did it herself, which everyone knows she could. Whoopi is far too talented and independent to be playing such a poorly conceived character. Also, the original story was about how liberating it was to do the things you wanted in a visage that everyone believed, but that ultimately you could be yourself by yourself. All the women power stuff was added unnecessarily, just casting a woman would have gotten the same point across without rubbing the audiences noise in it.

    For me, 'The Associate' makes a decent one-time watch. It starts on a promising note with a female black lawyer trying to make it in the man's world. However, at some point as the plot moves, it fails to engage and it's quite clear what will happen in the end. The point 'The Associate' tries to make is that woman can make it on top but it (perhaps unintentionally) presents the men under a negative light. Some of the male characters are presented as stereotypical chauvinists. There are some funny moments that bring a few chuckles but not much that would make one laugh out loud. The best scenes are the ones with Wiest and Goldberg together. Wiest is adorable as the sweet and smart Dugan and Goldberg is adequate as Ayres. However, Goldberg has played several such roles and done numerous similar movies before and even though she's very versatile, she hardly presents anything new in 'The Associate'. I would like to see more of her and Wiest in better movies.

    Women's lib would really go for this 1996 film about a woman who loses a promotion to her fellow worker despite her better experience and seniority. Since she will now be a subordinate to this guy, she quits and forms her own investment group. She is aided by a very frumpy Dianne Wiest. When she can't get anywhere due to her sex, she invents a male partner to get her ideas accepted. The film is a funny one and when Whoopi is forced to "produce" this partner, she gets a costume with the white face of a Marlon Brando mixed with a Thomas Jefferson profile and hair-do. That part is really hilarious. Of course, there is more fun ahead when Whoopi is accused of killing this partner and Wiest is accused of being an accessory to murder. With all this, the film is highly predictable but go enjoy it anyway.

    1st watched 5/9/2007 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Donald Petrie): OK comedy drama with Whoopi Goldberg playing a character reminiscent of the Robin Williams man to woman transformation character, Mrs. Doubtfire, but opposite, of course. Whoopi's character is a wall street investment associate in a firm where the men usually rule the roost. She is up for a promotion to Vice President, but loses it to her partner, primarily because he's a man who knows how to play to the higher-ups wim's. She quits and starts her own investment firm and invents an elderly white male partner named Robert S. Cutter and starts becoming very successful despite the fact that the companies never meet the illustrious Mr. Cutter, but instead Whoopi does all the work, and he's always traveling around the world and never available. Eventually, Cutter has to show himself and what we get is Whoopi in a pretty amazing transformation done by her cross-dressing friend. The transformation is so well done that it's hard to tell that it's Whoopi behind the wig, mask and the rounded-out body. The transformation isn't the problem in this movie, it's just that it has very few opportunities for Whoopi's comedic talents to come thru. Dianne Weist is actually very good in a supporting role as Whoopi's mega-talented secretary and Whoopi isn't bad in her performance with what she's given but the screenplay is very flat and un-inspired. This could have been a good expose on women in this field and how they're unable to penetrate the upper ranks but it doesn't come across that it has any desire to be much of anything which is very disappointing. I'd love to see Goldberg & Weist together again in a better film -- so maybe this will happen someday.

    While I would like to say that I'm sure the producers of this work had no intention of ripping off that iconic television show, I'm sure any fans of the show will agree with me when I say that it did just that. Without the rip off factor, this work is quite cute. It's empowering to women, and demonstrates how the premise of Remmington Steele's whole premise could actually happen. And you thought it was silly! Bah! Whooopie is awesome in this feature, and really commands the presence of an executive, but just beneath that corporate demeanor, lies the bad-a$$ who beat the snot out of "Ray" in Burglar. In spite of that, I loved it. Though it'll never win even a nomination, it was fun. Whoopie? Work more in FRONT of the camera! I miss you! This rates a 5.8/10 from... the Fiend :.

    THE ASSOCIATE ***1/2 Talented, competent executive Whoopi Goldberg decides to handle business her own way by starting her own Investments company after a nasty team player (Tim Daly) steals her job promotion. The story quickly makes us sympathetic disbelievers in Goldberg's success, however, as female discrimination hinders her from getting clients. What she plans on doing is nothing short of unlikely and strangely entertaining: Making up a wholly fictitious male associate and pretend all of her ideas are his. Her bond with Dianne Wiest, an endearing secretary who eventually starts working for her, enriches their characters as Goldberg finesses between managing her coming-of-renown business now that there is a "man" in charge of the whole thing, and dealing with the anti-feminist preferences of the Investments/Marketing business. When the third act is reached, the star actually has to impersonate the man she has made up...which makes for one of the funniest scenes when sexy stock-broker Bebe Neuwirth tries to seduce "him." Lots of fun.

Her bond with Dianne Wiest, an endearing secretary who eventually starts working for her, enriches their characters as Goldberg finesses between managing her coming-of-renown business now that there is a "man" in charge of the whole thing, and dealing with the anti-feminist preferences of the Investments/Marketing business. When the third act is reached, the star actually has to impersonate the man she has made up...which makes for one of the funniest scenes when sexy stock-broker Bebe Neuwirth tries to seduce "him." Lots of fun.

    Watchable if nothing else, this Whoopi Goldberg vehicle doesn't reach for the stars, but instead weaves social commentary on the glass ceiling and racial prejudice into the comedy of a business whiz (Goldberg) who invents a fictitious business partner when she finds she can't advance on her own merits, apparently due to her gender and race. But the ruse becomes difficult to manage as various investors demand to meet the elusive "Mr Cutty", and Goldberg resorts to costumes and well-staged theatrics to hide the fact that Cutty doesn't exist. Reasonable supporting cast features Tim Daly as a sleazy corporate type, ubiquitous to just about every film that depicts 'corporate America', Dianne Wiest as Goldberg's chronically under-appreciated right-hand woman, Eli Wallach as an old-school investor keen to meet the elusive Mr Cutty, and Austin Pendleton as a bookish inventor and CEO on the brink of bankruptcy until Goldberg can restore his standing. Blink and you'll miss Colleen Camp in a very minor role as a detective. Occasional slapstick and farce, fused with the usual dry-wit for which Goldberg is accustomed, it's a studio picture with all the typical hooks and clich&eacute;s, nevertheless, very mild and satisfying. And as a footnote, good to see Bebe Neuwirth in a particularly sultry role as an all-too-eager business associate to Wallach; she has a couple of scenes sans most of her wardrobe that are quite revealing.

    I'm surprised this film wasn't a bit more successful (it lost a ton of money) and better regarded than the rating it gets here. Overall, I enjoyed it. I thought Whoopi Goldberg was great as a struggling and then successful financial adviser. I wasn't clear -- was that her as Robert Cutty, or a stand-in? A real treasure here is the supporting part by Diane Weist as the secretary. Every time I see her I think what a treasure she is. The other supporting actors do their jobs, but hardly stand out. It is nice to see Eli Wallach as a rich businessman...he was 80 when he made this film, and although always a supporting actor, he always did a fine job. Tim Daly was appropriately sleazy in his role. And, it was nice to see Bebe Neuwirth (who most people recognize as Frazier Crane's wife) in a different part. Overall, the plot was handled nicely, with the overarching moral lesson being that in all walks of life there will be people who are inherently talented, but sometimes go unrecognized if they don't fit the usual racial (or other) pattern. The one part of the plot where things sort of fell apart was Robert Cutty's appearance at the hotel; this was sloppy and just didn't feel right. And blowing him up in a car -- the man who didn't even exist -- also seemed a bit slapstickish. But aside from those two areas, the script was pretty good. No, it's not the greatest comedy film ever made, but it's pretty decent and had a good moral point. Recommended, though it may not find its way to your DVD shelf.

    No, this is not from a John Grisham novel. An ambitious young black woman (Goldberg) tries to establish her own Wall Street investment firm, but quickly finds the business is part of the old boys' club. In order to get anyone to listen to her, she invents a male partner who always seems to be out of the office. This gets her into all sorts of jams. Director Donald Petrie wisely keeps Goldberg ducking and dodging all sorts of sticky situations for the first half, before having her slap on white face and a fat suit to pose as her imaginary partner in the second half. Dianne Wiest is wonderful as her mousy but very bright assistant, and the best parts of the movie are the scenes involving the two women. Bebe Nuewerth has a funny role as a corporate seductress, and Eli Wallach is a wealthy businessman eager to deal with Goldberg's firm but only if he can meet her partner. Tim Daly and Austin Pendleton add to the merriment as, respectively, Goldberg's ex-boss and a Bill Gates type. The movie walks a fine line between social commentary and laughs, and was shot in New York and New Jersey during winter, which gives the film a much more realistic look considering the absurdity of the premise.

    I always enjoy Whoopi Goldberg in films, and the 1996 film "The Associate" is no exception. Based on a French film, it's the story of a Laurel Ayres (Goldberg) who is having trouble "making it" in a man's world, though she's smarter than all of them. After being manipulated and beaten out of a promotion by at her old job by slick Frank (Tim Daly), Laurel starts her own company and quickly goes nowhere. She gets some help from an assistant at the old firm, Sally (Diane Wiest) and ultimately decides to make up a male associate, Robert Cutty. It works like a charm, and business is flying in the door. However, everyone is most anxious to meet Cutty, and there comes a point when she has to produce him. This is an amusing film that could have been hilarious. It does have some great moments, though, and likable characters in Goldberg and Wiest. Other fine performances include those of Daly, Lainie Kazan as a cutting columnist and Eli Wallach as a client. The other problem I have with the film is that it is sorely dated. It's hard to believe that, while sexism still exists, Laurel would have so much trouble from the old boys' network in 1996. Sure enough, as I suspected, the film on which it is based was done in 1979. Remington Steele, a TV series based on the same premise, was produced in the '80s. Surely in 1996, a woman of Laurel's obvious talent would have been more appreciated where she worked and could have launched a successful business without a fake male associate. Anne Mulcahy of Xerox and Ho Ching of Temasek Holdings are only two examples of such powerful executives from the 1990s.

    Whoopi Goldberg feels held back by her gender, so she gets a makeover as a man to jump start her ad agency. A lot of women defend this movie, but it seems like they should be insulted. Goldberg is reduced to getting fashion tips from a drag queen(man), getting inside tips from a mouse(man), and looking like a demented John Adams when she is remade as a white man. The movie would be really empowering if she did it herself, which everyone knows she could. Whoopi is far too talented and independent to be playing such a poorly conceived character. Also, the original story was about how liberating it was to do the things you wanted in a visage that everyone believed, but that ultimately you could be yourself by yourself. All the women power stuff was added unnecessarily, just casting a woman would have gotten the same point across without rubbing the audiences noise in it.

    For me, 'The Associate' makes a decent one-time watch. It starts on a promising note with a female black lawyer trying to make it in the man's world. However, at some point as the plot moves, it fails to engage and it's quite clear what will happen in the end. The point 'The Associate' tries to make is that woman can make it on top but it (perhaps unintentionally) presents the men under a negative light. Some of the male characters are presented as stereotypical chauvinists. There are some funny moments that bring a few chuckles but not much that would make one laugh out loud. The best scenes are the ones with Wiest and Goldberg together. Wiest is adorable as the sweet and smart Dugan and Goldberg is adequate as Ayres. However, Goldberg has played several such roles and done numerous similar movies before and even though she's very versatile, she hardly presents anything new in 'The Associate'. I would like to see more of her and Wiest in better movies.

    Women's lib would really go for this 1996 film about a woman who loses a promotion to her fellow worker despite her better experience and seniority. Since she will now be a subordinate to this guy, she quits and forms her own investment group. She is aided by a very frumpy Dianne Wiest. When she can't get anywhere due to her sex, she invents a male partner to get her ideas accepted. The film is a funny one and when Whoopi is forced to "produce" this partner, she gets a costume with the white face of a Marlon Brando mixed with a Thomas Jefferson profile and hair-do. That part is really hilarious. Of course, there is more fun ahead when Whoopi is accused of killing this partner and Wiest is accused of being an accessory to murder. With all this, the film is highly predictable but go enjoy it anyway.

    1st watched 5/9/2007 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Donald Petrie): OK comedy drama with Whoopi Goldberg playing a character reminiscent of the Robin Williams man to woman transformation character, Mrs. Doubtfire, but opposite, of course. Whoopi's character is a wall street investment associate in a firm where the men usually rule the roost. She is up for a promotion to Vice President, but loses it to her partner, primarily because he's a man who knows how to play to the higher-ups wim's. She quits and starts her own investment firm and invents an elderly white male partner named Robert S. Cutter and starts becoming very successful despite the fact that the companies never meet the illustrious Mr. Cutter, but instead Whoopi does all the work, and he's always traveling around the world and never available. Eventually, Cutter has to show himself and what we get is Whoopi in a pretty amazing transformation done by her cross-dressing friend. The transformation is so well done that it's hard to tell that it's Whoopi behind the wig, mask and the rounded-out body. The transformation isn't the problem in this movie, it's just that it has very few opportunities for Whoopi's comedic talents to come thru. Dianne Weist is actually very good in a supporting role as Whoopi's mega-talented secretary and Whoopi isn't bad in her performance with what she's given but the screenplay is very flat and un-inspired. This could have been a good expose on women in this field and how they're unable to penetrate the upper ranks but it doesn't come across that it has any desire to be much of anything which is very disappointing. I'd love to see Goldberg & Weist together again in a better film -- so maybe this will happen someday.

    While I would like to say that I'm sure the producers of this work had no intention of ripping off that iconic television show, I'm sure any fans of the show will agree with me when I say that it did just that. Without the rip off factor, this work is quite cute. It's empowering to women, and demonstrates how the premise of Remmington Steele's whole premise could actually happen. And you thought it was silly! Bah! Whooopie is awesome in this feature, and really commands the presence of an executive, but just beneath that corporate demeanor, lies the bad-a$$ who beat the snot out of "Ray" in Burglar. In spite of that, I loved it. Though it'll never win even a nomination, it was fun. Whoopie? Work more in FRONT of the camera! I miss you! This rates a 5.8/10 from... the Fiend :.
