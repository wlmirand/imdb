    This movie is great for kids, and any kid should see it. Many teens and adults may find this movie wasteful, but anyone who keeps an open mind and makes efforts to "read between the lines" can really see that there is a lesson to be learned. As in reality, there are many towns such as the fictional rural town this movie takes place in. In such towns (with closed industrial mills and no jobs,) you will find kids with too much time on their hands like in this movie. At the beginning, the kids didn't see a point to their lives and just didn't care. Sheriff Tom Palmer (Guttenberg) didn't have much of a life either. Anna Montgomery comes to town as the school teacher and really turns them around. She really teaches them to believe that they are no less of people than anyone else and that with hard work and persistence, one can achieve their goals. They don't even know how to play soccer in the beginning, but it goes to show that hard work, heart, persistence, belief, and teamwork can go a long ways. Anna Montgomery is a terrific teacher, coach, and leader. Towards the end, anyone can tell that they are changed for the better and learn to believe in themselves on and off the field, thanks to true leadership. I admit, this is not a movie with tons of adventure and excitement. Though it may not be a classic like Forrest Gump or Citizen Kane; it really is a great family movie and really goes to prove a point. I recommend it to anyone with a family and a heart to see the good that can come with good leadership and teamwork.

    "The Big Green" is about as useless as movies can possibly get. Almost the exact same movie as "Little Giants" (the difference being that one is about football and one is about soccer, which is called football in most other countries), this gag-reflex-inducing family-friendly film features every sports-genre clich&eacute; you could possibly imagine. The only thing it's missing is a sports-playing dog, and Steve Guttenberg doesn't count. Guttenberg, clearly burned-out, alcoholic, unshaven, fat, very obviously on his last legs as a bankable actor, and quite possibly the least appealing actor on Earth is in the lead, so you just KNOW it's going to be good. He looks so awful (and greasy), it almost seems as if a repellent odor is being emitted from your TV while you watch him. If he ever collaborated in a film with Tony Danza, the film would most likely have a similar effect to a powerful laxative. But perhaps that stench was just the film itself. Anyways, if you didn't know, this is yet another in a long line of mid-1990's family movies about sports, like "Space Jam." A bunch of worthless losers decide to take on a bunch of as*hole kids who seem to revel in bad sportsmanship (like "Little Giants"), heralded by a coach who thinks girls can't play sports (just like "Little Giants"). A bunch of stuff happens that I don't remember (I had difficulty paying attention), then the underdog kids bake their coach (Olivia D'Abo) a "chocolate cake," which looks more like a big pile of fecal matter (hence, "The Big Green Turd"), in one of the most inappropriately, pathetically sappy moments you'll ever see on film. Even the kids' smiles are creepy. Also, the fat kid keeps having the same fantasy over and over again (opposing team becoming ghouls and charging at him, only with different monsters each time), which is maddeningly repetitive. About the only positive thing I can say about this waste of film is that Olivia D'Abo is pretty good-looking in it. I was surprised by how attractive she actually is, even though I've only seen her in one other film, "Wayne's World 2" in which she was made up to resemble Dana Carvey (and that, brothers, is one Dana who ain't particularly good-lookin'). If you need any more convincing not to waste your time with this glacially-paced, third-rate Disney Channel TV movie drivel, just look at the poster: it is designed to look like the ginger kid is giving birth! Yeaaaah... Avoid.

    If you love children's movies or love a good comedy about kids this is the movie for you. It has some good actors in it that later on go on to even more things. The movie is absolutely hilarious but also teaches kids a good story. It takes a team who doesn't know anything about soccer and turns them into champions. It is very interesting to see everything they have to go through to get there. Loved it as a child. Even if you are not a soccer fan it's a great movie to watch. It sends kids a good message. Even as an adult I still love it. Recommended for children of all ages! It teaches you about teamwork and hard work can pay off in the end!

    I was around 8 or 9 when this movie came out. Despite there already being plenty of movies about misfits rising to the top,like The Mighty Ducks and Angles in the Outfield, this movie really was the best of them all. It of course starts out like normal, with the kids being resentful to anything new and having all-around bad attitudes. But with the help of a good coach and a new activity to immerse themselves in, their moral and moods change for the better, making them the winners they are. The journey to their win contains many easy laughs, and just a tiny bit of drama and romance. A movie for boys and girls alike ;) I thought it was and still is a great kids movie. I'm 20 now, and I still watch it to this day. Its a great feel-good movie for the whole family to enjoy!

    A great family film about soccer. I've loved this movie ever since I was a child. The plot isn't anything special and is rather predictable but the numerous comic scenes make up for it. the film not only deals with soccer but also with some more serious issues including one family's immigration problems and another child with an alcoholic father. The name The Big Green refers to the team's name which was what the field they play on used to be called. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when the children are practicing while the parents look on, when it starts to rain the kids wont give up the ball and the coaches and parents try and get the ball. what happens is a cute moment between all of the families playing soccer in the rain and mud together. overall this film is just very cute and I highly recommend it especially for families with young kids. or even for elderly people who can no longer understand a very complicated plot, my grandmother really enjoys this movie. anyways if you haven't seen this movie you should seek it out and watch it when you get the chance.

    The students in a small Texan town have a new teacher from England (Olivia D'Abo). She is trying hard to motivate and communicate with her pupils, with only limited success. Limited, that is, until she gets her students excited about soccer. She assembles a ragtime team, with no uniforms, and teaches them about the fundamentals of soccer. The team, with a mixture of girls and boys, begins playing matches. They lose. The teacher enlists the help of the local sheriff (Steve Guttenberg) and, together, they help the team improve. But, will they succeed in winning soccer games? This is another stroll down Mighty Ducks lane but it is still a good film for children. It's themes of hard work and teamwork are undeniable and very worthwhile. The actors, the script, and the Texas setting form a touching and funny film. If you want to find a good family film for a night at home, try this one. Big grins will pop up over The Big Green.

    Take a clich&eacute; story and insert Steve Guttenberg.Need i say anymore?This truly is as bad as you would expect. Sheriff Tom Palmer(Guttenberg)and Anna Montgormery attempt to transform a group of useless,inept kids into a winning soccer team.Lacking originality and direction from the offset it's quite a struggle to maintain any form of interest in this film. Despite my reservations about Guttenbergs acting ability i can safely say that the acting of the rival teams coach is actually worse than Guttenbergs.Previously unimaginable i thought. This type of story of underdogs battling all the way to the top has been done before and better every time than this so called 'film'

    If you're looking for a sophisticated piece of art, "The Big Green" is not it. This is a family film for elementary school kids. I watched this movie for the first time when I was nine, and I absolutely loved it. I loved cheering for the underdog, and from my nine-year-old point of view, all the events were realistic and all the characters were believable. I especially loved Larry, who was hilarious in his delusions. I watched this film again tonight and realize that it is a clich&eacute;d film, but only because I'm much older and more cynical. However, this does not take away the fact that it brought back the days when I resolutely believed that the harder I worked, the more it would pay off and that anybody could be a winner. It is optimistic, heart-warming and uplifting for that inner nine-year-old.

    HOW MANY MOVIES ARE THERE GOING TO BE IN WHICH AGAINST ALL ODDS, A RAGTAG TEAM BEATS THE BIG GUYS WITH ALL THE MONEY?!!!!!!!! There's nothing new in "The Big Green". If anything, you want them to lose. Steve Guttenberg used to have such a good resume ("The Boys from Brazil", "Police Academy", "Cocoon"). Why, OH WHY, did he have to do these sorts of movies during the 1990s and beyond?! So, just avoid this movie. There are plenty of good movies out there, so there's no reason to waste your time and money on this junk. Obviously, the "green" on their minds was money, because there's no creativity here. At least in recent years, Disney has produced some clever movies with Pixar.

She really teaches them to believe that they are no less of people than anyone else and that with hard work and persistence, one can achieve their goals. They don't even know how to play soccer in the beginning, but it goes to show that hard work, heart, persistence, belief, and teamwork can go a long ways. Anna Montgomery is a terrific teacher, coach, and leader. Towards the end, anyone can tell that they are changed for the better and learn to believe in themselves on and off the field, thanks to true leadership. I admit, this is not a movie with tons of adventure and excitement. Though it may not be a classic like Forrest Gump or Citizen Kane; it really is a great family movie and really goes to prove a point. I recommend it to anyone with a family and a heart to see the good that can come with good leadership and teamwork.

    "The Big Green" is about as useless as movies can possibly get. Almost the exact same movie as "Little Giants" (the difference being that one is about football and one is about soccer, which is called football in most other countries), this gag-reflex-inducing family-friendly film features every sports-genre clich&eacute; you could possibly imagine. The only thing it's missing is a sports-playing dog, and Steve Guttenberg doesn't count. Guttenberg, clearly burned-out, alcoholic, unshaven, fat, very obviously on his last legs as a bankable actor, and quite possibly the least appealing actor on Earth is in the lead, so you just KNOW it's going to be good. He looks so awful (and greasy), it almost seems as if a repellent odor is being emitted from your TV while you watch him. If he ever collaborated in a film with Tony Danza, the film would most likely have a similar effect to a powerful laxative. But perhaps that stench was just the film itself. Anyways, if you didn't know, this is yet another in a long line of mid-1990's family movies about sports, like "Space Jam." A bunch of worthless losers decide to take on a bunch of as*hole kids who seem to revel in bad sportsmanship (like "Little Giants"), heralded by a coach who thinks girls can't play sports (just like "Little Giants"). A bunch of stuff happens that I don't remember (I had difficulty paying attention), then the underdog kids bake their coach (Olivia D'Abo) a "chocolate cake," which looks more like a big pile of fecal matter (hence, "The Big Green Turd"), in one of the most inappropriately, pathetically sappy moments you'll ever see on film. Even the kids' smiles are creepy. Also, the fat kid keeps having the same fantasy over and over again (opposing team becoming ghouls and charging at him, only with different monsters each time), which is maddeningly repetitive. About the only positive thing I can say about this waste of film is that Olivia D'Abo is pretty good-looking in it. I was surprised by how attractive she actually is, even though I've only seen her in one other film, "Wayne's World 2" in which she was made up to resemble Dana Carvey (and that, brothers, is one Dana who ain't particularly good-lookin'). If you need any more convincing not to waste your time with this glacially-paced, third-rate Disney Channel TV movie drivel, just look at the poster: it is designed to look like the ginger kid is giving birth! Yeaaaah... Avoid.

    If you love children's movies or love a good comedy about kids this is the movie for you. It has some good actors in it that later on go on to even more things. The movie is absolutely hilarious but also teaches kids a good story. It takes a team who doesn't know anything about soccer and turns them into champions. It is very interesting to see everything they have to go through to get there. Loved it as a child. Even if you are not a soccer fan it's a great movie to watch. It sends kids a good message. Even as an adult I still love it. Recommended for children of all ages! It teaches you about teamwork and hard work can pay off in the end!

    This movie is great for kids, and any kid should see it. Many teens and adults may find this movie wasteful, but anyone who keeps an open mind and makes efforts to "read between the lines" can really see that there is a lesson to be learned. As in reality, there are many towns such as the fictional rural town this movie takes place in. In such towns (with closed industrial mills and no jobs,) you will find kids with too much time on their hands like in this movie. At the beginning, the kids didn't see a point to their lives and just didn't care. Sheriff Tom Palmer (Guttenberg) didn't have much of a life either. Anna Montgomery comes to town as the school teacher and really turns them around. She really teaches them to believe that they are no less of people than anyone else and that with hard work and persistence, one can achieve their goals. They don't even know how to play soccer in the beginning, but it goes to show that hard work, heart, persistence, belief, and teamwork can go a long ways. Anna Montgomery is a terrific teacher, coach, and leader. Towards the end, anyone can tell that they are changed for the better and learn to believe in themselves on and off the field, thanks to true leadership. I admit, this is not a movie with tons of adventure and excitement.

    I was around 8 or 9 when this movie came out. Despite there already being plenty of movies about misfits rising to the top,like The Mighty Ducks and Angles in the Outfield, this movie really was the best of them all. It of course starts out like normal, with the kids being resentful to anything new and having all-around bad attitudes. But with the help of a good coach and a new activity to immerse themselves in, their moral and moods change for the better, making them the winners they are. The journey to their win contains many easy laughs, and just a tiny bit of drama and romance. A movie for boys and girls alike ;) I thought it was and still is a great kids movie. I'm 20 now, and I still watch it to this day. Its a great feel-good movie for the whole family to enjoy!

    A great family film about soccer. I've loved this movie ever since I was a child. The plot isn't anything special and is rather predictable but the numerous comic scenes make up for it. the film not only deals with soccer but also with some more serious issues including one family's immigration problems and another child with an alcoholic father. The name The Big Green refers to the team's name which was what the field they play on used to be called. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when the children are practicing while the parents look on, when it starts to rain the kids wont give up the ball and the coaches and parents try and get the ball. what happens is a cute moment between all of the families playing soccer in the rain and mud together. overall this film is just very cute and I highly recommend it especially for families with young kids. or even for elderly people who can no longer understand a very complicated plot, my grandmother really enjoys this movie. anyways if you haven't seen this movie you should seek it out and watch it when you get the chance.

    The students in a small Texan town have a new teacher from England (Olivia D'Abo). She is trying hard to motivate and communicate with her pupils, with only limited success. Limited, that is, until she gets her students excited about soccer. She assembles a ragtime team, with no uniforms, and teaches them about the fundamentals of soccer. The team, with a mixture of girls and boys, begins playing matches. They lose. The teacher enlists the help of the local sheriff (Steve Guttenberg) and, together, they help the team improve. But, will they succeed in winning soccer games? This is another stroll down Mighty Ducks lane but it is still a good film for children. It's themes of hard work and teamwork are undeniable and very worthwhile. The actors, the script, and the Texas setting form a touching and funny film. If you want to find a good family film for a night at home, try this one. Big grins will pop up over The Big Green.

    Take a clich&eacute; story and insert Steve Guttenberg.Need i say anymore?This truly is as bad as you would expect. Sheriff Tom Palmer(Guttenberg)and Anna Montgormery attempt to transform a group of useless,inept kids into a winning soccer team.Lacking originality and direction from the offset it's quite a struggle to maintain any form of interest in this film. Despite my reservations about Guttenbergs acting ability i can safely say that the acting of the rival teams coach is actually worse than Guttenbergs.Previously unimaginable i thought. This type of story of underdogs battling all the way to the top has been done before and better every time than this so called 'film'

    If you're looking for a sophisticated piece of art, "The Big Green" is not it. This is a family film for elementary school kids. I watched this movie for the first time when I was nine, and I absolutely loved it. I loved cheering for the underdog, and from my nine-year-old point of view, all the events were realistic and all the characters were believable. I especially loved Larry, who was hilarious in his delusions. I watched this film again tonight and realize that it is a clich&eacute;d film, but only because I'm much older and more cynical. However, this does not take away the fact that it brought back the days when I resolutely believed that the harder I worked, the more it would pay off and that anybody could be a winner. It is optimistic, heart-warming and uplifting for that inner nine-year-old.

    HOW MANY MOVIES ARE THERE GOING TO BE IN WHICH AGAINST ALL ODDS, A RAGTAG TEAM BEATS THE BIG GUYS WITH ALL THE MONEY?!!!!!!!! There's nothing new in "The Big Green". If anything, you want them to lose. Steve Guttenberg used to have such a good resume ("The Boys from Brazil", "Police Academy", "Cocoon"). Why, OH WHY, did he have to do these sorts of movies during the 1990s and beyond?! So, just avoid this movie. There are plenty of good movies out there, so there's no reason to waste your time and money on this junk. Obviously, the "green" on their minds was money, because there's no creativity here. At least in recent years, Disney has produced some clever movies with Pixar.
