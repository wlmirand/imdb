 <sinopse>
  An angel tires of overseeing human activity and wishes to become human when he falls in love with a mortal.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  This Wim Wenders film centers around the story of two angels wandering in a mixture of post-war and modern Berlin. Invisible to humans, they nevertheless give their help and comfort to all the lonely and depressed souls they meet. Finally, after many centuries, one of the angels becomes unhappy with his immortal state and wishes to become human in order to experience the joys of everyday life. He meets a circus acrobat and finds in her the fufillment of all his mortal desires. He also discovers that he is not alone in making this cross over, and that a purely spiritual experience is not enough to satisfy anyone.

    This is a 1987 Franco-German film directed by Wim Wenders. It's one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Hollywood made a horrible remake in 1998, titled City of Angels, starring Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan. Nothing good comes out of it except for the soundtrack (in which Sarah McLachlan wrote and performed the song Angel). You could watch both version so that you can understand the 'miracle works' of (bad) Hollywood. :p I think all the words in this film are quotes, gosh they're so beautiful, and real, so true. No wonder the script is terribly good; Austrian novelist and playwright - Peter Handke, co-wrote the script. Not to mention the music, stunning!

    To describe today's troubling economy, one could say, as the poet Homer says in Wings of Desire: "The world seems to be sinking into dusk, but I tell the stories as in the beginning in my sing-song voice which sustains me, protected by the tale from the troubling present." This is only one example of many of the cinematic poetry used in Wim Wender's Wings of Desire. Homer is very reminiscent of another "Homer": The author of the Iliad. All of his dialog and even his blocking from the library scene to the couch in the middle of the field is pure poetry. In fact, the film itself is bookended in poetry. The movie starts with an angel Damiel writing in his journal" when the child was still a child" he had questions about the world, was not picky, and was generally more cooperative. The tale is told in German in a "sing-song" voice, "Als Das kind kind war..." He sits next to his Angel friend Cassiel (played by Otto Sadler, who previously starred in the epic movie Das Boot) in a convertible with the light reflecting off the windshield in such a way that it looks like wings. Damiel and Cassiel compare notes of what they have witnessed. The angels move around unseen among the people of Berlin, reading people's thoughts and whispering comforting words to people. The people too, are not completely seen by the angels. The angels can only view the world in black and white. While privy to all that will happen in the world and to immortality, angels do not know what it is like to feel, to taste, or to be acknowledged by a stranger. Damiel tells Cassiel that while it is great to live for eternity, he sometimes gets fed up with his spiritual existence. He longs to have blackened fingers from the newspaper, to have a fever, or to be excited by a meal. Cassiel reminds him that they are there to do no more that to preserve, collect, and testify. This too is poetry. The angels like to spend much time in the library. The library is full of books of knowledge and therefore seen as a sacred place. They are seen whispering to people who are reading, perhaps trying to inspire them. The irony is that the books contain text which the angels can see. Text, like the angels, can inspire a person only if he or she is open to it. Ironically, even though human beings cannot see angels, the angels, even though they read thoughts, cannot see the pictures painted by the imagination in the minds of the humans when reading text. Damiel yearns to be human even more when he goes to the circus and falls in love with his own angel: a trapeze artist that is dressed like an angel. He tells Cassiel that he wants to be human. Cassiel, in another example of cinematic poetry, brings albeit reluctantly, Damiel through the Berlin wall where he transforms to the human state and everything turns to color. Damiel and Cassiel are as symbolic as the Berlin wall that they pass through, as they are opposites. Damiel, free like the West, full of dreams and the desire to choose. Cassiel on the other hand is like the East: Rigid, does as instructed, no free thought or desires. Meanwhile in a subplot, the angels have been following Peter Falk who has come to Germany to make a film. Falk tells Damiel, "I can't see you, but I know that you are there." When Damiel turns human, he looks up Peter Falk and Falk reveals that he too used to be an angel. When Damiel asks him what to do or expect, Falk tells him that he has to figure it out and that's what makes it fun. Damiel leaves to go find his trapeze artist. After a series of near misses, Damiel and his trapeze artist end up at the same bar. Meanwhile, in another example of cinematic poetry, Cassiel closes his eyes in the bar and then the stage lights cast three different shadows off his body, alternating and shifting location and color as if the audience is watching him break into pieces. Lastly, after Damiel and the trapeze artist do you unite, they are seen together as she glides on the trapeze with artistic beauty and in another poetic motion, their shadows are seen dancing representing the visible and only partly visible, but as the shadows suggest that they are only partly visible, that is part of the fun.

    "Wings Of Desire" is probably New German Cinema director Wim Wenders' most famous film, the one by the director Germany is most proud of. For many, it's one of the very best films ever made coming out of the country, and one of the most beautiful art-house accomplishments of the last thirty years. It stars Bruno Ganz, Otto Sander, and Peter Falk, who appears as himself. Every day two angels wander the city of Berlin, listening to people's thoughts and following whoever they choose to. The angels can't interfere with the lives of humans, nor can they feel their emotions. It seems that only children are able to see them, as well as other angels who roam the city. One of the angels sees a trapeze artist in a circus, and after listening to her thoughts, he decides he now passionately aspires to be human, to feel a weight under his feet and to be able to experience the daily small pleasures he until then had only witnessed. Visually, the film is stunning: it's hard to forget the grace of the camera work accompanying the angels during their wanderings, as it gives a feeling of floating as if we were a third angel watching. The shifts between aerial shots (seen more in the first half of the film) and ground ones, and the shifts between gorgeous black-and-white and color &not;the first look symbolizing the angel's point of view, while the second symbolizing the immersions into the real world are other noticeable, auteur-ish touches. The score, although not as present as it should, is beautifully angelic, and the whispered, quiet sound design in the black-and-white scenes evoke a sublime sense of peace and harmony. But the whispers themselves, looking at the whole of them, form a big picture that is vividly human, and are a faithful text to our emotional palette in today's day. The different people the angels listen to are of all kind, many of them feeling lonely, gloomy, or just immersed in their problems and inner conflicts. Even though there's little positivity, this doesn't stop one of the angels, Damiel, from being attracted to mortality, to its flawed and fragile existence. It's a film that reminds us of how much of a blessing it is to be in this world in the first place, and it does so with such amazing grace and beauty. "Wings Of Desire" is one of the precious films that is truly full of positivity. It's a film that deserves praise for both its larger-than-life concepts, narrated with a strange, otherworldly lyricism, and its small accomplishments, like the warm smiles of Bruno Ganz and Peter Falk.

    please people, do not write a review if you stopped watching the movie half way through, because you know nothing of what you write about. this film IS very boring. IS very slow. if you can just get over that and watch it for watching sake, then it ranks as a very high quality flick. there are moments when you can be completely immersed into the feeling of the actors/actress. you do not forget this film very easily, and can always come back to it in moments of your life and reflect at the script writings accuracy as it relates to everyday life. putting Peter in was quite a break from the intensity of reading the subs. i can only feel that a very good dubbed version may have helped me appreciate the visuals more, but then, i can always watch it again. my one piece of advice? if you can watch this in segments over a few days,

    I've recently seen Wings of Desire again. Apart from the obvious artistic merit and grinding slow tempo, it struck me how it had historical importance that hadn't been perceived at the time of filming. Probably no one in the crew believed that Germany would unify a couple of years after the premiere and that Berlin would become whole again. I had the opportunity to visit the city several times in the first decade of 21st century and it is definitely not Berlin from Wings of Desire. With a comforting premise that angels are watching over us, we follow them during their usual day. Although they don't always succeed in keeping us happy, they try their best in making our life on this Earth easier. One of them longs for human experience and is even willing to trade the eternity and sterile knowledge of all things for it. And each second of the story about it transpires with the lust for life and the love for Berlin. The closing titles reveal a dedication to Yasujirō Ozu, Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut, and Andrei Tarkovsky. This might explain the slow tempo, which is in my opinion the only thing in Wings of Desire that didn't stand the test of time. This, in turn, deducts two stars from the perfect note.

    I was truly captivated for the first forty minutes of this film. As the camera seemed to sweep around the city of Berlin taking in the internal dialogue of all it encountered. The crowning moment of the opening scenes was a section filmed in the city Library which was just breathtaking. After this I quickly became bored. Apart from a brilliant cameo from Peter Faulk and a great scene in a Nick Cave gig the film's themes had little more to offer me. The cinematography was excellent throughout however, with a memorable shot of a bus in the twilight and a few timely transitions from black and white to colour. I would like to see this film cut back to a nice little 20 minute short. My Mother in Law disagrees on this point and thought the film was just perfect. Worth a stab but prepare for tedium. (The film... not my mother in law)

    In my opinion, this otherwise very well-crafted movie was totally spoiled by the self-conscious, heavy-handed performance of Solveig Dommartin, who unfortunately had way too much screen time. The awkwardness of her performance reaches a painful apogee in the scene in the club. I found her egoistic style of acting very embarrassing, and it ruined the movie for me. Too bad, because the performance of Bruno Ganz, the cinematography, the script and the score had great potential. To me it is an exemplar of how one bad performance can poison everything else. I found it very difficult to become engaged in this movie.

    I'd read a lot of good things about Wings of Desire, so when I finally got around to buying a copy of the film expectations were high. I know it's lame, but straight away I'm going to say that my favourite film of all time is probably Nicholas Roeg's 'Walkabout'. Why would I make that point? It's really just to make clear that I'm not automatically dismissive of films that aren't event driven, or feature long periods where nothing much happens. In some ways Wings of Desire isn't really about all that much and I'm not even going to try to explain the few things which do happen in the film. In another sense it's a film about absolutely everything and your interpretation and feelings toward the movie are going to depend largely on your own personality, what you expect from it and various other factors, including what sort of day you've had (it's very easy to space out during this movie!). The first two thirds of the movie are spent wondering what it is you're actually watching, as there's not really much in the way of dialogue (at least not much of interest). The final third of the film gives us some sort of resolve to the film, although really by this point most viewers are likely to be bored out of their mind. If I had to pick a scene which sums the movie up then it'd have to be the one where the angels are discussing what it is they lack in their existence. It seemed to go on forever and I couldn't really have cared less by the end of it, because they cite too many examples. If you think this sounds harsh, take a look through the quotes section on this movie to get an idea of what you'll be hearing throughout. There's no doubting that this film is well filmed and visually it's very impressive. It's an unusual film too and one which immediately grabs your attention. However, despite these qualities, the 'introduction' is just far too long and drawn out. The director could easily have covered the first hour in about 15 minutes. And I know some people would argue that this is to give us a sense of what it's like to live forever and all the rest, but it's really not necessary. In movies there are ways of conveying long periods of time. Flashbacks, a montage etc. But there's really no excuse for the way this movie starts, it takes forever to get going and the ending is totally unsatisfying. If you like your movies arty then check it out for the visuals alone, but if you like some sort of entertainment or something which is actually going to occupy your brain in some way then I'd avoid it.

    Must try to keep this brief. Ganz is an angel who comes to Earth to have a look around Berlin in 1987. Not clear at first. No one notices him as he wanders about. Never speaks. Reads everyone else's thoughts but not like "Ulysses." Reads everyone's -- not just one person -- so gets multiple streams of multiple consciousnesses. Slightly confusing. Is this how we really think? Why am I me and why not you?...The inside is the outside...Why am I trapped in this daily web?...I have always been most alone when in a toilet...Where is that Dunkel I ordered?...What is this nonsense all about and why am I thinking it?...There is no use in living for tomorrow because today is tomorrow...Occasional superimpositions of a pair of angel wings to give us a hint that Ganz is a heavenly creature in case it takes us too long to figure it out as it did me...Wo deine zanfte Flugel weilt...Yes I said yes. Peter Falk plays himself as an actor in a movie being shot in Berlin. We can hear his thoughts too when Ganz is near him. His thoughts don't tap into the metaphysical though. They run more along the lines of, "How do I look in this hat?" Ganz watches a rock band, follows a dying old man around, strolls through a library, watches kids at play -- all accompanied by rivulets of consciousness -- "Oh, weh, isn't this where the Potsdamer Platz used to be?" He watches a circus act and falls for a beautiful and supple trapeze artist. He decides to give up his angel hood and become human, and he meets the girl again while both of them are real and she takes Ganz home with her. A trapeze artist. I'll bet that was some big SURPRISE for an ex angel! Don't watch this if you lack patience.

    From director Wim Wenders (The American Friend; Paris, Texas), the title of this German film sounded like something that would be highly rated by the critics, especially appearing in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was only rated three out of five stars, but it wasn't going to stop me watching it. Basically in contemporary West Germany, while the Berlin Wall still stood, Damiel (Downfall's Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) are two angels invisible to all humans, besides very young children and people close to death, and they wander the city watching various people. They give help to the lonely and depressed souls that they can, but Damiel has become unhappy with the centuries of immortality and longs to become a human so he can blend into the world he adores and is fascinated by so much. One of the biggest reasons he wants to experience the joys of everyday human life is because he has been watching in particular lonely circus trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he has fallen in love with her, but of course physical interaction is impossible. Cassiel also wishes to be human as well, but Damiel is able to strip himself of his immortality, and he wakes up from the black and white into the colourful real world and experiences at last what it is like to be human, bleeding, eating food and drinking coffee, and wearing regular clothing. Cassiel meanwhile unintentionally finds himself connected with a young man who wants to commit suicide, but still an angel he cannot do anything to stop him, and when he does take his own life Cassiel is haunted by event. Damiel finally gets to meet Marion in person, and it is obvious that there is some kind of familiarity between them, despite never meeting in real life, and they get closer by the end of the film, where it says To Be Continued... (concluding in the sequel Faraway, So Close!). Throughout the film, Columbo actor Peter Falk shows up to give his incites into city and human life, with a strange knowledge for everything, including the existence of angels, apparently he used to be one himself. Also starring Curt Bois as Homer the aged poet. Ganz gives a good sensitive performance as the angel wanting to be human and in love, Dommartin is nice as his love interest, and Falk is witty and likable as himself. The film was remade in a few aspects into the Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan film City of Angels, the romantic element certainly, and despite some of the story being a little predictable, there are some great small effects and cinematography, it a worthwhile fantasy drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language. Good!

Apart from the obvious artistic merit and grinding slow tempo, it struck me how it had historical importance that hadn't been perceived at the time of filming. Probably no one in the crew believed that Germany would unify a couple of years after the premiere and that Berlin would become whole again. I had the opportunity to visit the city several times in the first decade of 21st century and it is definitely not Berlin from Wings of Desire. With a comforting premise that angels are watching over us, we follow them during their usual day. Although they don't always succeed in keeping us happy, they try their best in making our life on this Earth easier. One of them longs for human experience and is even willing to trade the eternity and sterile knowledge of all things for it. And each second of the story about it transpires with the lust for life and the love for Berlin. The closing titles reveal a dedication to Yasujirō Ozu, Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut, and Andrei Tarkovsky. This might explain the slow tempo, which is in my opinion the only thing in Wings of Desire that didn't stand the test of time. This, in turn, deducts two stars from the perfect note.

    I was truly captivated for the first forty minutes of this film. As the camera seemed to sweep around the city of Berlin taking in the internal dialogue of all it encountered. The crowning moment of the opening scenes was a section filmed in the city Library which was just breathtaking. After this I quickly became bored. Apart from a brilliant cameo from Peter Faulk and a great scene in a Nick Cave gig the film's themes had little more to offer me. The cinematography was excellent throughout however, with a memorable shot of a bus in the twilight and a few timely transitions from black and white to colour. I would like to see this film cut back to a nice little 20 minute short. My Mother in Law disagrees on this point and thought the film was just perfect. Worth a stab but prepare for tedium. (The film... not my mother in law)

    In my opinion, this otherwise very well-crafted movie was totally spoiled by the self-conscious, heavy-handed performance of Solveig Dommartin, who unfortunately had way too much screen time. The awkwardness of her performance reaches a painful apogee in the scene in the club. I found her egoistic style of acting very embarrassing, and it ruined the movie for me. Too bad, because the performance of Bruno Ganz, the cinematography, the script and the score had great potential. To me it is an exemplar of how one bad performance can poison everything else. I found it very difficult to become engaged in this movie.

    I'd read a lot of good things about Wings of Desire, so when I finally got around to buying a copy of the film expectations were high. I know it's lame, but straight away I'm going to say that my favourite film of all time is probably Nicholas Roeg's 'Walkabout'. Why would I make that point? It's really just to make clear that I'm not automatically dismissive of films that aren't event driven, or feature long periods where nothing much happens. In some ways Wings of Desire isn't really about all that much and I'm not even going to try to explain the few things which do happen in the film. In another sense it's a film about absolutely everything and your interpretation and feelings toward the movie are going to depend largely on your own personality, what you expect from it and various other factors, including what sort of day you've had (it's very easy to space out during this movie!). The first two thirds of the movie are spent wondering what it is you're actually watching, as there's not really much in the way of dialogue (at least not much of interest). The final third of the film gives us some sort of resolve to the film, although really by this point most viewers are likely to be bored out of their mind. If I had to pick a scene which sums the movie up then it'd have to be the one where the angels are discussing what it is they lack in their existence. It seemed to go on forever and I couldn't really have cared less by the end of it, because they cite too many examples. If you think this sounds harsh, take a look through the quotes section on this movie to get an idea of what you'll be hearing throughout. There's no doubting that this film is well filmed and visually it's very impressive. It's an unusual film too and one which immediately grabs your attention. However, despite these qualities, the 'introduction' is just far too long and drawn out. The director could easily have covered the first hour in about 15 minutes. And I know some people would argue that this is to give us a sense of what it's like to live forever and all the rest, but it's really not necessary. In movies there are ways of conveying long periods of time. Flashbacks, a montage etc. But there's really no excuse for the way this movie starts, it takes forever to get going and the ending is totally unsatisfying. If you like your movies arty then check it out for the visuals alone, but if you like some sort of entertainment or something which is actually going to occupy your brain in some way then I'd avoid it.

    Must try to keep this brief. Ganz is an angel who comes to Earth to have a look around Berlin in 1987. Not clear at first. No one notices him as he wanders about. Never speaks. Reads everyone else's thoughts but not like "Ulysses." Reads everyone's -- not just one person -- so gets multiple streams of multiple consciousnesses. Slightly confusing. Is this how we really think? Why am I me and why not you?...The inside is the outside...Why am I trapped in this daily web?...I have always been most alone when in a toilet...Where is that Dunkel I ordered?...What is this nonsense all about and why am I thinking it?...There is no use in living for tomorrow because today is tomorrow...Occasional superimpositions of a pair of angel wings to give us a hint that Ganz is a heavenly creature in case it takes us too long to figure it out as it did me...Wo deine zanfte Flugel weilt...Yes I said yes. Peter Falk plays himself as an actor in a movie being shot in Berlin. We can hear his thoughts too when Ganz is near him. His thoughts don't tap into the metaphysical though. They run more along the lines of, "How do I look in this hat?" Ganz watches a rock band, follows a dying old man around, strolls through a library, watches kids at play -- all accompanied by rivulets of consciousness -- "Oh, weh, isn't this where the Potsdamer Platz used to be?" He watches a circus act and falls for a beautiful and supple trapeze artist. He decides to give up his angel hood and become human, and he meets the girl again while both of them are real and she takes Ganz home with her. A trapeze artist. I'll bet that was some big SURPRISE for an ex angel! Don't watch this if you lack patience.

    From director Wim Wenders (The American Friend; Paris, Texas), the title of this German film sounded like something that would be highly rated by the critics, especially appearing in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was only rated three out of five stars, but it wasn't going to stop me watching it. Basically in contemporary West Germany, while the Berlin Wall still stood, Damiel (Downfall's Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) are two angels invisible to all humans, besides very young children and people close to death, and they wander the city watching various people. They give help to the lonely and depressed souls that they can, but Damiel has become unhappy with the centuries of immortality and longs to become a human so he can blend into the world he adores and is fascinated by so much. One of the biggest reasons he wants to experience the joys of everyday human life is because he has been watching in particular lonely circus trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he has fallen in love with her, but of course physical interaction is impossible. Cassiel also wishes to be human as well, but Damiel is able to strip himself of his immortality, and he wakes up from the black and white into the colourful real world and experiences at last what it is like to be human, bleeding, eating food and drinking coffee, and wearing regular clothing. Cassiel meanwhile unintentionally finds himself connected with a young man who wants to commit suicide, but still an angel he cannot do anything to stop him, and when he does take his own life Cassiel is haunted by event. Damiel finally gets to meet Marion in person, and it is obvious that there is some kind of familiarity between them, despite never meeting in real life, and they get closer by the end of the film, where it says To Be Continued... (concluding in the sequel Faraway, So Close!). Throughout the film, Columbo actor Peter Falk shows up to give his incites into city and human life, with a strange knowledge for everything, including the existence of angels, apparently he used to be one himself. Also starring Curt Bois as Homer the aged poet. Ganz gives a good sensitive performance as the angel wanting to be human and in love, Dommartin is nice as his love interest, and Falk is witty and likable as himself. The film was remade in a few aspects into the Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan film City of Angels, the romantic element certainly, and despite some of the story being a little predictable, there are some great small effects and cinematography, it a worthwhile fantasy drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language. Good!

    This is a 1987 Franco-German film directed by Wim Wenders. It's one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Hollywood made a horrible remake in 1998, titled City of Angels, starring Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan. Nothing good comes out of it except for the soundtrack (in which Sarah McLachlan wrote and performed the song Angel). You could watch both version so that you can understand the 'miracle works' of (bad) Hollywood. :p I think all the words in this film are quotes, gosh they're so beautiful, and real, so true. No wonder the script is terribly good; Austrian novelist and playwright - Peter Handke, co-wrote the script. Not to mention the music, stunning!

    To describe today's troubling economy, one could say, as the poet Homer says in Wings of Desire: "The world seems to be sinking into dusk, but I tell the stories as in the beginning in my sing-song voice which sustains me, protected by the tale from the troubling present." This is only one example of many of the cinematic poetry used in Wim Wender's Wings of Desire. Homer is very reminiscent of another "Homer": The author of the Iliad. All of his dialog and even his blocking from the library scene to the couch in the middle of the field is pure poetry. In fact, the film itself is bookended in poetry. The movie starts with an angel Damiel writing in his journal" when the child was still a child" he had questions about the world, was not picky, and was generally more cooperative. The tale is told in German in a "sing-song" voice, "Als Das kind kind war..." He sits next to his Angel friend Cassiel (played by Otto Sadler, who previously starred in the epic movie Das Boot) in a convertible with the light reflecting off the windshield in such a way that it looks like wings. Damiel and Cassiel compare notes of what they have witnessed. The angels move around unseen among the people of Berlin, reading people's thoughts and whispering comforting words to people. The people too, are not completely seen by the angels. The angels can only view the world in black and white. While privy to all that will happen in the world and to immortality, angels do not know what it is like to feel, to taste, or to be acknowledged by a stranger. Damiel tells Cassiel that while it is great to live for eternity, he sometimes gets fed up with his spiritual existence. He longs to have blackened fingers from the newspaper, to have a fever, or to be excited by a meal. Cassiel reminds him that they are there to do no more that to preserve, collect, and testify. This too is poetry. The angels like to spend much time in the library. The library is full of books of knowledge and therefore seen as a sacred place. They are seen whispering to people who are reading, perhaps trying to inspire them. The irony is that the books contain text which the angels can see. Text, like the angels, can inspire a person only if he or she is open to it. Ironically, even though human beings cannot see angels, the angels, even though they read thoughts, cannot see the pictures painted by the imagination in the minds of the humans when reading text. Damiel yearns to be human even more when he goes to the circus and falls in love with his own angel: a trapeze artist that is dressed like an angel. He tells Cassiel that he wants to be human. Cassiel, in another example of cinematic poetry, brings albeit reluctantly, Damiel through the Berlin wall where he transforms to the human state and everything turns to color. Damiel and Cassiel are as symbolic as the Berlin wall that they pass through, as they are opposites. Damiel, free like the West, full of dreams and the desire to choose. Cassiel on the other hand is like the East: Rigid, does as instructed, no free thought or desires. Meanwhile in a subplot, the angels have been following Peter Falk who has come to Germany to make a film. Falk tells Damiel, "I can't see you, but I know that you are there." When Damiel turns human, he looks up Peter Falk and Falk reveals that he too used to be an angel. When Damiel asks him what to do or expect, Falk tells him that he has to figure it out and that's what makes it fun. Damiel leaves to go find his trapeze artist. After a series of near misses, Damiel and his trapeze artist end up at the same bar. Meanwhile, in another example of cinematic poetry, Cassiel closes his eyes in the bar and then the stage lights cast three different shadows off his body, alternating and shifting location and color as if the audience is watching him break into pieces. Lastly, after Damiel and the trapeze artist do you unite, they are seen together as she glides on the trapeze with artistic beauty and in another poetic motion, their shadows are seen dancing representing the visible and only partly visible, but as the shadows suggest that they are only partly visible, that is part of the fun.

    "Wings Of Desire" is probably New German Cinema director Wim Wenders' most famous film, the one by the director Germany is most proud of. For many, it's one of the very best films ever made coming out of the country, and one of the most beautiful art-house accomplishments of the last thirty years. It stars Bruno Ganz, Otto Sander, and Peter Falk, who appears as himself. Every day two angels wander the city of Berlin, listening to people's thoughts and following whoever they choose to. The angels can't interfere with the lives of humans, nor can they feel their emotions. It seems that only children are able to see them, as well as other angels who roam the city. One of the angels sees a trapeze artist in a circus, and after listening to her thoughts, he decides he now passionately aspires to be human, to feel a weight under his feet and to be able to experience the daily small pleasures he until then had only witnessed. Visually, the film is stunning: it's hard to forget the grace of the camera work accompanying the angels during their wanderings, as it gives a feeling of floating as if we were a third angel watching. The shifts between aerial shots (seen more in the first half of the film) and ground ones, and the shifts between gorgeous black-and-white and color &not;the first look symbolizing the angel's point of view, while the second symbolizing the immersions into the real world are other noticeable, auteur-ish touches. The score, although not as present as it should, is beautifully angelic, and the whispered, quiet sound design in the black-and-white scenes evoke a sublime sense of peace and harmony. But the whispers themselves, looking at the whole of them, form a big picture that is vividly human, and are a faithful text to our emotional palette in today's day. The different people the angels listen to are of all kind, many of them feeling lonely, gloomy, or just immersed in their problems and inner conflicts. Even though there's little positivity, this doesn't stop one of the angels, Damiel, from being attracted to mortality, to its flawed and fragile existence. It's a film that reminds us of how much of a blessing it is to be in this world in the first place, and it does so with such amazing grace and beauty. "Wings Of Desire" is one of the precious films that is truly full of positivity. It's a film that deserves praise for both its larger-than-life concepts, narrated with a strange, otherworldly lyricism, and its small accomplishments, like the warm smiles of Bruno Ganz and Peter Falk.

    please people, do not write a review if you stopped watching the movie half way through, because you know nothing of what you write about. this film IS very boring. IS very slow. if you can just get over that and watch it for watching sake, then it ranks as a very high quality flick. there are moments when you can be completely immersed into the feeling of the actors/actress. you do not forget this film very easily, and can always come back to it in moments of your life and reflect at the script writings accuracy as it relates to everyday life. putting Peter in was quite a break from the intensity of reading the subs. i can only feel that a very good dubbed version may have helped me appreciate the visuals more, but then, i can always watch it again. my one piece of advice? if you can watch this in segments over a few days,

No wonder the script is terribly good; Austrian novelist and playwright - Peter Handke, co-wrote the script. Not to mention the music, stunning!

    To describe today's troubling economy, one could say, as the poet Homer says in Wings of Desire: "The world seems to be sinking into dusk, but I tell the stories as in the beginning in my sing-song voice which sustains me, protected by the tale from the troubling present." This is only one example of many of the cinematic poetry used in Wim Wender's Wings of Desire. Homer is very reminiscent of another "Homer": The author of the Iliad. All of his dialog and even his blocking from the library scene to the couch in the middle of the field is pure poetry. In fact, the film itself is bookended in poetry. The movie starts with an angel Damiel writing in his journal" when the child was still a child" he had questions about the world, was not picky, and was generally more cooperative. The tale is told in German in a "sing-song" voice, "Als Das kind kind war..." He sits next to his Angel friend Cassiel (played by Otto Sadler, who previously starred in the epic movie Das Boot) in a convertible with the light reflecting off the windshield in such a way that it looks like wings. Damiel and Cassiel compare notes of what they have witnessed. The angels move around unseen among the people of Berlin, reading people's thoughts and whispering comforting words to people. The people too, are not completely seen by the angels. The angels can only view the world in black and white. While privy to all that will happen in the world and to immortality, angels do not know what it is like to feel, to taste, or to be acknowledged by a stranger. Damiel tells Cassiel that while it is great to live for eternity, he sometimes gets fed up with his spiritual existence. He longs to have blackened fingers from the newspaper, to have a fever, or to be excited by a meal. Cassiel reminds him that they are there to do no more that to preserve, collect, and testify. This too is poetry. The angels like to spend much time in the library. The library is full of books of knowledge and therefore seen as a sacred place. They are seen whispering to people who are reading, perhaps trying to inspire them. The irony is that the books contain text which the angels can see. Text, like the angels, can inspire a person only if he or she is open to it. Ironically, even though human beings cannot see angels, the angels, even though they read thoughts, cannot see the pictures painted by the imagination in the minds of the humans when reading text. Damiel yearns to be human even more when he goes to the circus and falls in love with his own angel: a trapeze artist that is dressed like an angel. He tells Cassiel that he wants to be human. Cassiel, in another example of cinematic poetry, brings albeit reluctantly, Damiel through the Berlin wall where he transforms to the human state and everything turns to color. Damiel and Cassiel are as symbolic as the Berlin wall that they pass through, as they are opposites. Damiel, free like the West, full of dreams and the desire to choose. Cassiel on the other hand is like the East: Rigid, does as instructed, no free thought or desires. Meanwhile in a subplot, the angels have been following Peter Falk who has come to Germany to make a film. Falk tells Damiel, "I can't see you, but I know that you are there." When Damiel turns human, he looks up Peter Falk and Falk reveals that he too used to be an angel. When Damiel asks him what to do or expect, Falk tells him that he has to figure it out and that's what makes it fun. Damiel leaves to go find his trapeze artist. After a series of near misses, Damiel and his trapeze artist end up at the same bar. Meanwhile, in another example of cinematic poetry, Cassiel closes his eyes in the bar and then the stage lights cast three different shadows off his body, alternating and shifting location and color as if the audience is watching him break into pieces. Lastly, after Damiel and the trapeze artist do you unite, they are seen together as she glides on the trapeze with artistic beauty and in another poetic motion, their shadows are seen dancing representing the visible and only partly visible, but as the shadows suggest that they are only partly visible, that is part of the fun.

    "Wings Of Desire" is probably New German Cinema director Wim Wenders' most famous film, the one by the director Germany is most proud of. For many, it's one of the very best films ever made coming out of the country, and one of the most beautiful art-house accomplishments of the last thirty years. It stars Bruno Ganz, Otto Sander, and Peter Falk, who appears as himself. Every day two angels wander the city of Berlin, listening to people's thoughts and following whoever they choose to. The angels can't interfere with the lives of humans, nor can they feel their emotions. It seems that only children are able to see them, as well as other angels who roam the city. One of the angels sees a trapeze artist in a circus, and after listening to her thoughts, he decides he now passionately aspires to be human, to feel a weight under his feet and to be able to experience the daily small pleasures he until then had only witnessed. Visually, the film is stunning: it's hard to forget the grace of the camera work accompanying the angels during their wanderings, as it gives a feeling of floating as if we were a third angel watching. The shifts between aerial shots (seen more in the first half of the film) and ground ones, and the shifts between gorgeous black-and-white and color &not;the first look symbolizing the angel's point of view, while the second symbolizing the immersions into the real world are other noticeable, auteur-ish touches. The score, although not as present as it should, is beautifully angelic, and the whispered, quiet sound design in the black-and-white scenes evoke a sublime sense of peace and harmony. But the whispers themselves, looking at the whole of them, form a big picture that is vividly human, and are a faithful text to our emotional palette in today's day. The different people the angels listen to are of all kind, many of them feeling lonely, gloomy, or just immersed in their problems and inner conflicts. Even though there's little positivity, this doesn't stop one of the angels, Damiel, from being attracted to mortality, to its flawed and fragile existence. It's a film that reminds us of how much of a blessing it is to be in this world in the first place, and it does so with such amazing grace and beauty. "Wings Of Desire" is one of the precious films that is truly full of positivity. It's a film that deserves praise for both its larger-than-life concepts, narrated with a strange, otherworldly lyricism, and its small accomplishments, like the warm smiles of Bruno Ganz and Peter Falk.

    please people, do not write a review if you stopped watching the movie half way through, because you know nothing of what you write about. this film IS very boring. IS very slow. if you can just get over that and watch it for watching sake, then it ranks as a very high quality flick. there are moments when you can be completely immersed into the feeling of the actors/actress. you do not forget this film very easily, and can always come back to it in moments of your life and reflect at the script writings accuracy as it relates to everyday life. putting Peter in was quite a break from the intensity of reading the subs. i can only feel that a very good dubbed version may have helped me appreciate the visuals more, but then, i can always watch it again. my one piece of advice? if you can watch this in segments over a few days,

    I've recently seen Wings of Desire again. Apart from the obvious artistic merit and grinding slow tempo, it struck me how it had historical importance that hadn't been perceived at the time of filming. Probably no one in the crew believed that Germany would unify a couple of years after the premiere and that Berlin would become whole again. I had the opportunity to visit the city several times in the first decade of 21st century and it is definitely not Berlin from Wings of Desire. With a comforting premise that angels are watching over us, we follow them during their usual day. Although they don't always succeed in keeping us happy, they try their best in making our life on this Earth easier. One of them longs for human experience and is even willing to trade the eternity and sterile knowledge of all things for it. And each second of the story about it transpires with the lust for life and the love for Berlin. The closing titles reveal a dedication to Yasujirō Ozu, Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut, and Andrei Tarkovsky. This might explain the slow tempo, which is in my opinion the only thing in Wings of Desire that didn't stand the test of time. This, in turn, deducts two stars from the perfect note.

    I was truly captivated for the first forty minutes of this film. As the camera seemed to sweep around the city of Berlin taking in the internal dialogue of all it encountered. The crowning moment of the opening scenes was a section filmed in the city Library which was just breathtaking. After this I quickly became bored. Apart from a brilliant cameo from Peter Faulk and a great scene in a Nick Cave gig the film's themes had little more to offer me. The cinematography was excellent throughout however, with a memorable shot of a bus in the twilight and a few timely transitions from black and white to colour. I would like to see this film cut back to a nice little 20 minute short. My Mother in Law disagrees on this point and thought the film was just perfect. Worth a stab but prepare for tedium.

    In my opinion, this otherwise very well-crafted movie was totally spoiled by the self-conscious, heavy-handed performance of Solveig Dommartin, who unfortunately had way too much screen time. The awkwardness of her performance reaches a painful apogee in the scene in the club. I found her egoistic style of acting very embarrassing, and it ruined the movie for me. Too bad, because the performance of Bruno Ganz, the cinematography, the script and the score had great potential. To me it is an exemplar of how one bad performance can poison everything else. I found it very difficult to become engaged in this movie.

    I'd read a lot of good things about Wings of Desire, so when I finally got around to buying a copy of the film expectations were high. I know it's lame, but straight away I'm going to say that my favourite film of all time is probably Nicholas Roeg's 'Walkabout'. Why would I make that point? It's really just to make clear that I'm not automatically dismissive of films that aren't event driven, or feature long periods where nothing much happens. In some ways Wings of Desire isn't really about all that much and I'm not even going to try to explain the few things which do happen in the film. In another sense it's a film about absolutely everything and your interpretation and feelings toward the movie are going to depend largely on your own personality, what you expect from it and various other factors, including what sort of day you've had (it's very easy to space out during this movie!). The first two thirds of the movie are spent wondering what it is you're actually watching, as there's not really much in the way of dialogue (at least not much of interest). The final third of the film gives us some sort of resolve to the film, although really by this point most viewers are likely to be bored out of their mind. If I had to pick a scene which sums the movie up then it'd have to be the one where the angels are discussing what it is they lack in their existence. It seemed to go on forever and I couldn't really have cared less by the end of it, because they cite too many examples. If you think this sounds harsh, take a look through the quotes section on this movie to get an idea of what you'll be hearing throughout. There's no doubting that this film is well filmed and visually it's very impressive. It's an unusual film too and one which immediately grabs your attention. However, despite these qualities, the 'introduction' is just far too long and drawn out. The director could easily have covered the first hour in about 15 minutes. And I know some people would argue that this is to give us a sense of what it's like to live forever and all the rest, but it's really not necessary. In movies there are ways of conveying long periods of time. Flashbacks, a montage etc. But there's really no excuse for the way this movie starts, it takes forever to get going and the ending is totally unsatisfying. If you like your movies arty then check it out for the visuals alone, but if you like some sort of entertainment or something which is actually going to occupy your brain in some way then I'd avoid it.

    Must try to keep this brief. Ganz is an angel who comes to Earth to have a look around Berlin in 1987. Not clear at first. No one notices him as he wanders about. Never speaks. Reads everyone else's thoughts but not like "Ulysses." Reads everyone's -- not just one person -- so gets multiple streams of multiple consciousnesses. Slightly confusing. Is this how we really think? Why am I me and why not you?...The inside is the outside...Why am I trapped in this daily web?...I have always been most alone when in a toilet...Where is that Dunkel I ordered?...What is this nonsense all about and why am I thinking it?...There is no use in living for tomorrow because today is tomorrow...Occasional superimpositions of a pair of angel wings to give us a hint that Ganz is a heavenly creature in case it takes us too long to figure it out as it did me...Wo deine zanfte Flugel weilt...Yes I said yes. Peter Falk plays himself as an actor in a movie being shot in Berlin. We can hear his thoughts too when Ganz is near him. His thoughts don't tap into the metaphysical though. They run more along the lines of, "How do I look in this hat?" Ganz watches a rock band, follows a dying old man around, strolls through a library, watches kids at play -- all accompanied by rivulets of consciousness -- "Oh, weh, isn't this where the Potsdamer Platz used to be?" He watches a circus act and falls for a beautiful and supple trapeze artist. He decides to give up his angel hood and become human, and he meets the girl again while both of them are real and she takes Ganz home with her. A trapeze artist. I'll bet that was some big SURPRISE for an ex angel! Don't watch this if you lack patience.

    From director Wim Wenders (The American Friend; Paris, Texas), the title of this German film sounded like something that would be highly rated by the critics, especially appearing in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was only rated three out of five stars, but it wasn't going to stop me watching it. Basically in contemporary West Germany, while the Berlin Wall still stood, Damiel (Downfall's Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) are two angels invisible to all humans, besides very young children and people close to death, and they wander the city watching various people. They give help to the lonely and depressed souls that they can, but Damiel has become unhappy with the centuries of immortality and longs to become a human so he can blend into the world he adores and is fascinated by so much. One of the biggest reasons he wants to experience the joys of everyday human life is because he has been watching in particular lonely circus trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he has fallen in love with her, but of course physical interaction is impossible. Cassiel also wishes to be human as well, but Damiel is able to strip himself of his immortality, and he wakes up from the black and white into the colourful real world and experiences at last what it is like to be human, bleeding, eating food and drinking coffee, and wearing regular clothing. Cassiel meanwhile unintentionally finds himself connected with a young man who wants to commit suicide, but still an angel he cannot do anything to stop him, and when he does take his own life Cassiel is haunted by event. Damiel finally gets to meet Marion in person, and it is obvious that there is some kind of familiarity between them, despite never meeting in real life, and they get closer by the end of the film, where it says To Be Continued... (concluding in the sequel Faraway, So Close!). Throughout the film, Columbo actor Peter Falk shows up to give his incites into city and human life, with a strange knowledge for everything, including the existence of angels, apparently he used to be one himself. Also starring Curt Bois as Homer the aged poet. Ganz gives a good sensitive performance as the angel wanting to be human and in love, Dommartin is nice as his love interest, and Falk is witty and likable as himself. The film was remade in a few aspects into the Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan film City of Angels, the romantic element certainly, and despite some of the story being a little predictable, there are some great small effects and cinematography, it a worthwhile fantasy drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language. Good!

    This is a 1987 Franco-German film directed by Wim Wenders. It's one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Hollywood made a horrible remake in 1998, titled City of Angels, starring Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan. Nothing good comes out of it except for the soundtrack (in which Sarah McLachlan wrote and performed the song Angel). You could watch both version so that you can understand the 'miracle works' of (bad) Hollywood. :p I think all the words in this film are quotes, gosh they're so beautiful, and real, so true.

Too bad, because the performance of Bruno Ganz, the cinematography, the script and the score had great potential. To me it is an exemplar of how one bad performance can poison everything else. I found it very difficult to become engaged in this movie.

    I'd read a lot of good things about Wings of Desire, so when I finally got around to buying a copy of the film expectations were high. I know it's lame, but straight away I'm going to say that my favourite film of all time is probably Nicholas Roeg's 'Walkabout'. Why would I make that point? It's really just to make clear that I'm not automatically dismissive of films that aren't event driven, or feature long periods where nothing much happens. In some ways Wings of Desire isn't really about all that much and I'm not even going to try to explain the few things which do happen in the film. In another sense it's a film about absolutely everything and your interpretation and feelings toward the movie are going to depend largely on your own personality, what you expect from it and various other factors, including what sort of day you've had (it's very easy to space out during this movie!). The first two thirds of the movie are spent wondering what it is you're actually watching, as there's not really much in the way of dialogue (at least not much of interest). The final third of the film gives us some sort of resolve to the film, although really by this point most viewers are likely to be bored out of their mind. If I had to pick a scene which sums the movie up then it'd have to be the one where the angels are discussing what it is they lack in their existence. It seemed to go on forever and I couldn't really have cared less by the end of it, because they cite too many examples. If you think this sounds harsh, take a look through the quotes section on this movie to get an idea of what you'll be hearing throughout. There's no doubting that this film is well filmed and visually it's very impressive. It's an unusual film too and one which immediately grabs your attention. However, despite these qualities, the 'introduction' is just far too long and drawn out. The director could easily have covered the first hour in about 15 minutes. And I know some people would argue that this is to give us a sense of what it's like to live forever and all the rest, but it's really not necessary. In movies there are ways of conveying long periods of time. Flashbacks, a montage etc. But there's really no excuse for the way this movie starts, it takes forever to get going and the ending is totally unsatisfying. If you like your movies arty then check it out for the visuals alone, but if you like some sort of entertainment or something which is actually going to occupy your brain in some way then I'd avoid it.

    Must try to keep this brief. Ganz is an angel who comes to Earth to have a look around Berlin in 1987. Not clear at first. No one notices him as he wanders about. Never speaks. Reads everyone else's thoughts but not like "Ulysses." Reads everyone's -- not just one person -- so gets multiple streams of multiple consciousnesses. Slightly confusing. Is this how we really think? Why am I me and why not you?...The inside is the outside...Why am I trapped in this daily web?...I have always been most alone when in a toilet...Where is that Dunkel I ordered?...What is this nonsense all about and why am I thinking it?...There is no use in living for tomorrow because today is tomorrow...Occasional superimpositions of a pair of angel wings to give us a hint that Ganz is a heavenly creature in case it takes us too long to figure it out as it did me...Wo deine zanfte Flugel weilt...Yes I said yes. Peter Falk plays himself as an actor in a movie being shot in Berlin. We can hear his thoughts too when Ganz is near him. His thoughts don't tap into the metaphysical though. They run more along the lines of, "How do I look in this hat?" Ganz watches a rock band, follows a dying old man around, strolls through a library, watches kids at play -- all accompanied by rivulets of consciousness -- "Oh, weh, isn't this where the Potsdamer Platz used to be?" He watches a circus act and falls for a beautiful and supple trapeze artist. He decides to give up his angel hood and become human, and he meets the girl again while both of them are real and she takes Ganz home with her. A trapeze artist. I'll bet that was some big SURPRISE for an ex angel! Don't watch this if you lack patience.

    From director Wim Wenders (The American Friend; Paris, Texas), the title of this German film sounded like something that would be highly rated by the critics, especially appearing in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was only rated three out of five stars, but it wasn't going to stop me watching it. Basically in contemporary West Germany, while the Berlin Wall still stood, Damiel (Downfall's Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) are two angels invisible to all humans, besides very young children and people close to death, and they wander the city watching various people. They give help to the lonely and depressed souls that they can, but Damiel has become unhappy with the centuries of immortality and longs to become a human so he can blend into the world he adores and is fascinated by so much. One of the biggest reasons he wants to experience the joys of everyday human life is because he has been watching in particular lonely circus trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he has fallen in love with her, but of course physical interaction is impossible. Cassiel also wishes to be human as well, but Damiel is able to strip himself of his immortality, and he wakes up from the black and white into the colourful real world and experiences at last what it is like to be human, bleeding, eating food and drinking coffee, and wearing regular clothing. Cassiel meanwhile unintentionally finds himself connected with a young man who wants to commit suicide, but still an angel he cannot do anything to stop him, and when he does take his own life Cassiel is haunted by event. Damiel finally gets to meet Marion in person, and it is obvious that there is some kind of familiarity between them, despite never meeting in real life, and they get closer by the end of the film, where it says To Be Continued... (concluding in the sequel Faraway, So Close!). Throughout the film, Columbo actor Peter Falk shows up to give his incites into city and human life, with a strange knowledge for everything, including the existence of angels, apparently he used to be one himself. Also starring Curt Bois as Homer the aged poet. Ganz gives a good sensitive performance as the angel wanting to be human and in love, Dommartin is nice as his love interest, and Falk is witty and likable as himself. The film was remade in a few aspects into the Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan film City of Angels, the romantic element certainly, and despite some of the story being a little predictable, there are some great small effects and cinematography, it a worthwhile fantasy drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language. Good!

    This is a 1987 Franco-German film directed by Wim Wenders. It's one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Hollywood made a horrible remake in 1998, titled City of Angels, starring Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan. Nothing good comes out of it except for the soundtrack (in which Sarah McLachlan wrote and performed the song Angel). You could watch both version so that you can understand the 'miracle works' of (bad) Hollywood. :p I think all the words in this film are quotes, gosh they're so beautiful, and real, so true. No wonder the script is terribly good; Austrian novelist and playwright - Peter Handke, co-wrote the script. Not to mention the music, stunning!

    To describe today's troubling economy, one could say, as the poet Homer says in Wings of Desire: "The world seems to be sinking into dusk, but I tell the stories as in the beginning in my sing-song voice which sustains me, protected by the tale from the troubling present." This is only one example of many of the cinematic poetry used in Wim Wender's Wings of Desire. Homer is very reminiscent of another "Homer": The author of the Iliad. All of his dialog and even his blocking from the library scene to the couch in the middle of the field is pure poetry. In fact, the film itself is bookended in poetry. The movie starts with an angel Damiel writing in his journal" when the child was still a child" he had questions about the world, was not picky, and was generally more cooperative. The tale is told in German in a "sing-song" voice, "Als Das kind kind war..." He sits next to his Angel friend Cassiel (played by Otto Sadler, who previously starred in the epic movie Das Boot) in a convertible with the light reflecting off the windshield in such a way that it looks like wings. Damiel and Cassiel compare notes of what they have witnessed. The angels move around unseen among the people of Berlin, reading people's thoughts and whispering comforting words to people. The people too, are not completely seen by the angels. The angels can only view the world in black and white. While privy to all that will happen in the world and to immortality, angels do not know what it is like to feel, to taste, or to be acknowledged by a stranger. Damiel tells Cassiel that while it is great to live for eternity, he sometimes gets fed up with his spiritual existence. He longs to have blackened fingers from the newspaper, to have a fever, or to be excited by a meal. Cassiel reminds him that they are there to do no more that to preserve, collect, and testify. This too is poetry. The angels like to spend much time in the library. The library is full of books of knowledge and therefore seen as a sacred place. They are seen whispering to people who are reading, perhaps trying to inspire them. The irony is that the books contain text which the angels can see. Text, like the angels, can inspire a person only if he or she is open to it. Ironically, even though human beings cannot see angels, the angels, even though they read thoughts, cannot see the pictures painted by the imagination in the minds of the humans when reading text. Damiel yearns to be human even more when he goes to the circus and falls in love with his own angel: a trapeze artist that is dressed like an angel. He tells Cassiel that he wants to be human. Cassiel, in another example of cinematic poetry, brings albeit reluctantly, Damiel through the Berlin wall where he transforms to the human state and everything turns to color. Damiel and Cassiel are as symbolic as the Berlin wall that they pass through, as they are opposites. Damiel, free like the West, full of dreams and the desire to choose. Cassiel on the other hand is like the East: Rigid, does as instructed, no free thought or desires. Meanwhile in a subplot, the angels have been following Peter Falk who has come to Germany to make a film. Falk tells Damiel, "I can't see you, but I know that you are there." When Damiel turns human, he looks up Peter Falk and Falk reveals that he too used to be an angel. When Damiel asks him what to do or expect, Falk tells him that he has to figure it out and that's what makes it fun. Damiel leaves to go find his trapeze artist. After a series of near misses, Damiel and his trapeze artist end up at the same bar. Meanwhile, in another example of cinematic poetry, Cassiel closes his eyes in the bar and then the stage lights cast three different shadows off his body, alternating and shifting location and color as if the audience is watching him break into pieces. Lastly, after Damiel and the trapeze artist do you unite, they are seen together as she glides on the trapeze with artistic beauty and in another poetic motion, their shadows are seen dancing representing the visible and only partly visible, but as the shadows suggest that they are only partly visible, that is part of the fun.

    "Wings Of Desire" is probably New German Cinema director Wim Wenders' most famous film, the one by the director Germany is most proud of. For many, it's one of the very best films ever made coming out of the country, and one of the most beautiful art-house accomplishments of the last thirty years. It stars Bruno Ganz, Otto Sander, and Peter Falk, who appears as himself. Every day two angels wander the city of Berlin, listening to people's thoughts and following whoever they choose to. The angels can't interfere with the lives of humans, nor can they feel their emotions. It seems that only children are able to see them, as well as other angels who roam the city. One of the angels sees a trapeze artist in a circus, and after listening to her thoughts, he decides he now passionately aspires to be human, to feel a weight under his feet and to be able to experience the daily small pleasures he until then had only witnessed. Visually, the film is stunning: it's hard to forget the grace of the camera work accompanying the angels during their wanderings, as it gives a feeling of floating as if we were a third angel watching. The shifts between aerial shots (seen more in the first half of the film) and ground ones, and the shifts between gorgeous black-and-white and color &not;the first look symbolizing the angel's point of view, while the second symbolizing the immersions into the real world are other noticeable, auteur-ish touches. The score, although not as present as it should, is beautifully angelic, and the whispered, quiet sound design in the black-and-white scenes evoke a sublime sense of peace and harmony. But the whispers themselves, looking at the whole of them, form a big picture that is vividly human, and are a faithful text to our emotional palette in today's day. The different people the angels listen to are of all kind, many of them feeling lonely, gloomy, or just immersed in their problems and inner conflicts. Even though there's little positivity, this doesn't stop one of the angels, Damiel, from being attracted to mortality, to its flawed and fragile existence. It's a film that reminds us of how much of a blessing it is to be in this world in the first place, and it does so with such amazing grace and beauty. "Wings Of Desire" is one of the precious films that is truly full of positivity. It's a film that deserves praise for both its larger-than-life concepts, narrated with a strange, otherworldly lyricism, and its small accomplishments, like the warm smiles of Bruno Ganz and Peter Falk.

    please people, do not write a review if you stopped watching the movie half way through, because you know nothing of what you write about. this film IS very boring. IS very slow. if you can just get over that and watch it for watching sake, then it ranks as a very high quality flick. there are moments when you can be completely immersed into the feeling of the actors/actress. you do not forget this film very easily, and can always come back to it in moments of your life and reflect at the script writings accuracy as it relates to everyday life. putting Peter in was quite a break from the intensity of reading the subs. i can only feel that a very good dubbed version may have helped me appreciate the visuals more, but then, i can always watch it again. my one piece of advice? if you can watch this in segments over a few days,

    I've recently seen Wings of Desire again. Apart from the obvious artistic merit and grinding slow tempo, it struck me how it had historical importance that hadn't been perceived at the time of filming. Probably no one in the crew believed that Germany would unify a couple of years after the premiere and that Berlin would become whole again. I had the opportunity to visit the city several times in the first decade of 21st century and it is definitely not Berlin from Wings of Desire. With a comforting premise that angels are watching over us, we follow them during their usual day. Although they don't always succeed in keeping us happy, they try their best in making our life on this Earth easier. One of them longs for human experience and is even willing to trade the eternity and sterile knowledge of all things for it. And each second of the story about it transpires with the lust for life and the love for Berlin. The closing titles reveal a dedication to Yasujirō Ozu, Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut, and Andrei Tarkovsky. This might explain the slow tempo, which is in my opinion the only thing in Wings of Desire that didn't stand the test of time. This, in turn, deducts two stars from the perfect note.

    I was truly captivated for the first forty minutes of this film. As the camera seemed to sweep around the city of Berlin taking in the internal dialogue of all it encountered. The crowning moment of the opening scenes was a section filmed in the city Library which was just breathtaking. After this I quickly became bored. Apart from a brilliant cameo from Peter Faulk and a great scene in a Nick Cave gig the film's themes had little more to offer me. The cinematography was excellent throughout however, with a memorable shot of a bus in the twilight and a few timely transitions from black and white to colour. I would like to see this film cut back to a nice little 20 minute short. My Mother in Law disagrees on this point and thought the film was just perfect. Worth a stab but prepare for tedium. (The film... not my mother in law)

Damiel yearns to be human even more when he goes to the circus and falls in love with his own angel: a trapeze artist that is dressed like an angel. He tells Cassiel that he wants to be human. Cassiel, in another example of cinematic poetry, brings albeit reluctantly, Damiel through the Berlin wall where he transforms to the human state and everything turns to color. Damiel and Cassiel are as symbolic as the Berlin wall that they pass through, as they are opposites. Damiel, free like the West, full of dreams and the desire to choose. Cassiel on the other hand is like the East: Rigid, does as instructed, no free thought or desires. Meanwhile in a subplot, the angels have been following Peter Falk who has come to Germany to make a film. Falk tells Damiel, "I can't see you, but I know that you are there." When Damiel turns human, he looks up Peter Falk and Falk reveals that he too used to be an angel. When Damiel asks him what to do or expect, Falk tells him that he has to figure it out and that's what makes it fun. Damiel leaves to go find his trapeze artist. After a series of near misses, Damiel and his trapeze artist end up at the same bar. Meanwhile, in another example of cinematic poetry, Cassiel closes his eyes in the bar and then the stage lights cast three different shadows off his body, alternating and shifting location and color as if the audience is watching him break into pieces. Lastly, after Damiel and the trapeze artist do you unite, they are seen together as she glides on the trapeze with artistic beauty and in another poetic motion, their shadows are seen dancing representing the visible and only partly visible, but as the shadows suggest that they are only partly visible, that is part of the fun.

    "Wings Of Desire" is probably New German Cinema director Wim Wenders' most famous film, the one by the director Germany is most proud of. For many, it's one of the very best films ever made coming out of the country, and one of the most beautiful art-house accomplishments of the last thirty years. It stars Bruno Ganz, Otto Sander, and Peter Falk, who appears as himself. Every day two angels wander the city of Berlin, listening to people's thoughts and following whoever they choose to. The angels can't interfere with the lives of humans, nor can they feel their emotions. It seems that only children are able to see them, as well as other angels who roam the city. One of the angels sees a trapeze artist in a circus, and after listening to her thoughts, he decides he now passionately aspires to be human, to feel a weight under his feet and to be able to experience the daily small pleasures he until then had only witnessed. Visually, the film is stunning: it's hard to forget the grace of the camera work accompanying the angels during their wanderings, as it gives a feeling of floating as if we were a third angel watching. The shifts between aerial shots (seen more in the first half of the film) and ground ones, and the shifts between gorgeous black-and-white and color &not;the first look symbolizing the angel's point of view, while the second symbolizing the immersions into the real world are other noticeable, auteur-ish touches. The score, although not as present as it should, is beautifully angelic, and the whispered, quiet sound design in the black-and-white scenes evoke a sublime sense of peace and harmony. But the whispers themselves, looking at the whole of them, form a big picture that is vividly human, and are a faithful text to our emotional palette in today's day. The different people the angels listen to are of all kind, many of them feeling lonely, gloomy, or just immersed in their problems and inner conflicts. Even though there's little positivity, this doesn't stop one of the angels, Damiel, from being attracted to mortality, to its flawed and fragile existence. It's a film that reminds us of how much of a blessing it is to be in this world in the first place, and it does so with such amazing grace and beauty. "Wings Of Desire" is one of the precious films that is truly full of positivity. It's a film that deserves praise for both its larger-than-life concepts, narrated with a strange, otherworldly lyricism, and its small accomplishments, like the warm smiles of Bruno Ganz and Peter Falk.

    please people, do not write a review if you stopped watching the movie half way through, because you know nothing of what you write about. this film IS very boring. IS very slow. if you can just get over that and watch it for watching sake, then it ranks as a very high quality flick. there are moments when you can be completely immersed into the feeling of the actors/actress. you do not forget this film very easily, and can always come back to it in moments of your life and reflect at the script writings accuracy as it relates to everyday life. putting Peter in was quite a break from the intensity of reading the subs. i can only feel that a very good dubbed version may have helped me appreciate the visuals more, but then, i can always watch it again. my one piece of advice? if you can watch this in segments over a few days,

    I've recently seen Wings of Desire again. Apart from the obvious artistic merit and grinding slow tempo, it struck me how it had historical importance that hadn't been perceived at the time of filming. Probably no one in the crew believed that Germany would unify a couple of years after the premiere and that Berlin would become whole again. I had the opportunity to visit the city several times in the first decade of 21st century and it is definitely not Berlin from Wings of Desire. With a comforting premise that angels are watching over us, we follow them during their usual day. Although they don't always succeed in keeping us happy, they try their best in making our life on this Earth easier. One of them longs for human experience and is even willing to trade the eternity and sterile knowledge of all things for it. And each second of the story about it transpires with the lust for life and the love for Berlin. The closing titles reveal a dedication to Yasujirō Ozu, Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut, and Andrei Tarkovsky. This might explain the slow tempo, which is in my opinion the only thing in Wings of Desire that didn't stand the test of time. This, in turn, deducts two stars from the perfect note.

    I was truly captivated for the first forty minutes of this film. As the camera seemed to sweep around the city of Berlin taking in the internal dialogue of all it encountered. The crowning moment of the opening scenes was a section filmed in the city Library which was just breathtaking. After this I quickly became bored. Apart from a brilliant cameo from Peter Faulk and a great scene in a Nick Cave gig the film's themes had little more to offer me. The cinematography was excellent throughout however, with a memorable shot of a bus in the twilight and a few timely transitions from black and white to colour. I would like to see this film cut back to a nice little 20 minute short. My Mother in Law disagrees on this point and thought the film was just perfect. Worth a stab but prepare for tedium.

    In my opinion, this otherwise very well-crafted movie was totally spoiled by the self-conscious, heavy-handed performance of Solveig Dommartin, who unfortunately had way too much screen time. The awkwardness of her performance reaches a painful apogee in the scene in the club. I found her egoistic style of acting very embarrassing, and it ruined the movie for me. Too bad, because the performance of Bruno Ganz, the cinematography, the script and the score had great potential. To me it is an exemplar of how one bad performance can poison everything else. I found it very difficult to become engaged in this movie.

    I'd read a lot of good things about Wings of Desire, so when I finally got around to buying a copy of the film expectations were high. I know it's lame, but straight away I'm going to say that my favourite film of all time is probably Nicholas Roeg's 'Walkabout'. Why would I make that point? It's really just to make clear that I'm not automatically dismissive of films that aren't event driven, or feature long periods where nothing much happens. In some ways Wings of Desire isn't really about all that much and I'm not even going to try to explain the few things which do happen in the film. In another sense it's a film about absolutely everything and your interpretation and feelings toward the movie are going to depend largely on your own personality, what you expect from it and various other factors, including what sort of day you've had (it's very easy to space out during this movie!). The first two thirds of the movie are spent wondering what it is you're actually watching, as there's not really much in the way of dialogue (at least not much of interest). The final third of the film gives us some sort of resolve to the film, although really by this point most viewers are likely to be bored out of their mind. If I had to pick a scene which sums the movie up then it'd have to be the one where the angels are discussing what it is they lack in their existence. It seemed to go on forever and I couldn't really have cared less by the end of it, because they cite too many examples. If you think this sounds harsh, take a look through the quotes section on this movie to get an idea of what you'll be hearing throughout. There's no doubting that this film is well filmed and visually it's very impressive. It's an unusual film too and one which immediately grabs your attention. However, despite these qualities, the 'introduction' is just far too long and drawn out. The director could easily have covered the first hour in about 15 minutes. And I know some people would argue that this is to give us a sense of what it's like to live forever and all the rest, but it's really not necessary. In movies there are ways of conveying long periods of time. Flashbacks, a montage etc. But there's really no excuse for the way this movie starts, it takes forever to get going and the ending is totally unsatisfying. If you like your movies arty then check it out for the visuals alone, but if you like some sort of entertainment or something which is actually going to occupy your brain in some way then I'd avoid it.

    Must try to keep this brief. Ganz is an angel who comes to Earth to have a look around Berlin in 1987. Not clear at first. No one notices him as he wanders about. Never speaks. Reads everyone else's thoughts but not like "Ulysses." Reads everyone's -- not just one person -- so gets multiple streams of multiple consciousnesses. Slightly confusing. Is this how we really think? Why am I me and why not you?...The inside is the outside...Why am I trapped in this daily web?...I have always been most alone when in a toilet...Where is that Dunkel I ordered?...What is this nonsense all about and why am I thinking it?...There is no use in living for tomorrow because today is tomorrow...Occasional superimpositions of a pair of angel wings to give us a hint that Ganz is a heavenly creature in case it takes us too long to figure it out as it did me...Wo deine zanfte Flugel weilt...Yes I said yes. Peter Falk plays himself as an actor in a movie being shot in Berlin. We can hear his thoughts too when Ganz is near him. His thoughts don't tap into the metaphysical though. They run more along the lines of, "How do I look in this hat?" Ganz watches a rock band, follows a dying old man around, strolls through a library, watches kids at play -- all accompanied by rivulets of consciousness -- "Oh, weh, isn't this where the Potsdamer Platz used to be?" He watches a circus act and falls for a beautiful and supple trapeze artist. He decides to give up his angel hood and become human, and he meets the girl again while both of them are real and she takes Ganz home with her. A trapeze artist. I'll bet that was some big SURPRISE for an ex angel! Don't watch this if you lack patience.

    From director Wim Wenders (The American Friend; Paris, Texas), the title of this German film sounded like something that would be highly rated by the critics, especially appearing in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was only rated three out of five stars, but it wasn't going to stop me watching it. Basically in contemporary West Germany, while the Berlin Wall still stood, Damiel (Downfall's Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) are two angels invisible to all humans, besides very young children and people close to death, and they wander the city watching various people. They give help to the lonely and depressed souls that they can, but Damiel has become unhappy with the centuries of immortality and longs to become a human so he can blend into the world he adores and is fascinated by so much. One of the biggest reasons he wants to experience the joys of everyday human life is because he has been watching in particular lonely circus trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he has fallen in love with her, but of course physical interaction is impossible. Cassiel also wishes to be human as well, but Damiel is able to strip himself of his immortality, and he wakes up from the black and white into the colourful real world and experiences at last what it is like to be human, bleeding, eating food and drinking coffee, and wearing regular clothing. Cassiel meanwhile unintentionally finds himself connected with a young man who wants to commit suicide, but still an angel he cannot do anything to stop him, and when he does take his own life Cassiel is haunted by event. Damiel finally gets to meet Marion in person, and it is obvious that there is some kind of familiarity between them, despite never meeting in real life, and they get closer by the end of the film, where it says To Be Continued... (concluding in the sequel Faraway, So Close!). Throughout the film, Columbo actor Peter Falk shows up to give his incites into city and human life, with a strange knowledge for everything, including the existence of angels, apparently he used to be one himself. Also starring Curt Bois as Homer the aged poet. Ganz gives a good sensitive performance as the angel wanting to be human and in love, Dommartin is nice as his love interest, and Falk is witty and likable as himself. The film was remade in a few aspects into the Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan film City of Angels, the romantic element certainly, and despite some of the story being a little predictable, there are some great small effects and cinematography, it a worthwhile fantasy drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language. Good!

    This is a 1987 Franco-German film directed by Wim Wenders. It's one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Hollywood made a horrible remake in 1998, titled City of Angels, starring Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan. Nothing good comes out of it except for the soundtrack (in which Sarah McLachlan wrote and performed the song Angel). You could watch both version so that you can understand the 'miracle works' of (bad) Hollywood. :p I think all the words in this film are quotes, gosh they're so beautiful, and real, so true. No wonder the script is terribly good; Austrian novelist and playwright - Peter Handke, co-wrote the script. Not to mention the music, stunning!

    To describe today's troubling economy, one could say, as the poet Homer says in Wings of Desire: "The world seems to be sinking into dusk, but I tell the stories as in the beginning in my sing-song voice which sustains me, protected by the tale from the troubling present." This is only one example of many of the cinematic poetry used in Wim Wender's Wings of Desire. Homer is very reminiscent of another "Homer": The author of the Iliad. All of his dialog and even his blocking from the library scene to the couch in the middle of the field is pure poetry. In fact, the film itself is bookended in poetry. The movie starts with an angel Damiel writing in his journal" when the child was still a child" he had questions about the world, was not picky, and was generally more cooperative. The tale is told in German in a "sing-song" voice, "Als Das kind kind war..." He sits next to his Angel friend Cassiel (played by Otto Sadler, who previously starred in the epic movie Das Boot) in a convertible with the light reflecting off the windshield in such a way that it looks like wings. Damiel and Cassiel compare notes of what they have witnessed. The angels move around unseen among the people of Berlin, reading people's thoughts and whispering comforting words to people. The people too, are not completely seen by the angels. The angels can only view the world in black and white. While privy to all that will happen in the world and to immortality, angels do not know what it is like to feel, to taste, or to be acknowledged by a stranger. Damiel tells Cassiel that while it is great to live for eternity, he sometimes gets fed up with his spiritual existence. He longs to have blackened fingers from the newspaper, to have a fever, or to be excited by a meal. Cassiel reminds him that they are there to do no more that to preserve, collect, and testify. This too is poetry. The angels like to spend much time in the library. The library is full of books of knowledge and therefore seen as a sacred place. They are seen whispering to people who are reading, perhaps trying to inspire them. The irony is that the books contain text which the angels can see. Text, like the angels, can inspire a person only if he or she is open to it. Ironically, even though human beings cannot see angels, the angels, even though they read thoughts, cannot see the pictures painted by the imagination in the minds of the humans when reading text. Damiel yearns to be human even more when he goes to the circus and falls in love with his own angel: a trapeze artist that is dressed like an angel. He tells Cassiel that he wants to be human. Cassiel, in another example of cinematic poetry, brings albeit reluctantly, Damiel through the Berlin wall where he transforms to the human state and everything turns to color. Damiel and Cassiel are as symbolic as the Berlin wall that they pass through, as they are opposites. Damiel, free like the West, full of dreams and the desire to choose. Cassiel on the other hand is like the East: Rigid, does as instructed, no free thought or desires. Meanwhile in a subplot, the angels have been following Peter Falk who has come to Germany to make a film. Falk tells Damiel, "I can't see you, but I know that you are there." When Damiel turns human, he looks up Peter Falk and Falk reveals that he too used to be an angel. When Damiel asks him what to do or expect, Falk tells him that he has to figure it out and that's what makes it fun. Damiel leaves to go find his trapeze artist.

Flashbacks, a montage etc. But there's really no excuse for the way this movie starts, it takes forever to get going and the ending is totally unsatisfying. If you like your movies arty then check it out for the visuals alone, but if you like some sort of entertainment or something which is actually going to occupy your brain in some way then I'd avoid it.

    Must try to keep this brief. Ganz is an angel who comes to Earth to have a look around Berlin in 1987. Not clear at first. No one notices him as he wanders about. Never speaks. Reads everyone else's thoughts but not like "Ulysses." Reads everyone's -- not just one person -- so gets multiple streams of multiple consciousnesses. Slightly confusing. Is this how we really think? Why am I me and why not you?...The inside is the outside...Why am I trapped in this daily web?...I have always been most alone when in a toilet...Where is that Dunkel I ordered?...What is this nonsense all about and why am I thinking it?...There is no use in living for tomorrow because today is tomorrow...Occasional superimpositions of a pair of angel wings to give us a hint that Ganz is a heavenly creature in case it takes us too long to figure it out as it did me...Wo deine zanfte Flugel weilt...Yes I said yes. Peter Falk plays himself as an actor in a movie being shot in Berlin. We can hear his thoughts too when Ganz is near him. His thoughts don't tap into the metaphysical though. They run more along the lines of, "How do I look in this hat?" Ganz watches a rock band, follows a dying old man around, strolls through a library, watches kids at play -- all accompanied by rivulets of consciousness -- "Oh, weh, isn't this where the Potsdamer Platz used to be?" He watches a circus act and falls for a beautiful and supple trapeze artist. He decides to give up his angel hood and become human, and he meets the girl again while both of them are real and she takes Ganz home with her. A trapeze artist. I'll bet that was some big SURPRISE for an ex angel! Don't watch this if you lack patience.

    From director Wim Wenders (The American Friend; Paris, Texas), the title of this German film sounded like something that would be highly rated by the critics, especially appearing in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was only rated three out of five stars, but it wasn't going to stop me watching it. Basically in contemporary West Germany, while the Berlin Wall still stood, Damiel (Downfall's Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) are two angels invisible to all humans, besides very young children and people close to death, and they wander the city watching various people. They give help to the lonely and depressed souls that they can, but Damiel has become unhappy with the centuries of immortality and longs to become a human so he can blend into the world he adores and is fascinated by so much. One of the biggest reasons he wants to experience the joys of everyday human life is because he has been watching in particular lonely circus trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he has fallen in love with her, but of course physical interaction is impossible. Cassiel also wishes to be human as well, but Damiel is able to strip himself of his immortality, and he wakes up from the black and white into the colourful real world and experiences at last what it is like to be human, bleeding, eating food and drinking coffee, and wearing regular clothing. Cassiel meanwhile unintentionally finds himself connected with a young man who wants to commit suicide, but still an angel he cannot do anything to stop him, and when he does take his own life Cassiel is haunted by event. Damiel finally gets to meet Marion in person, and it is obvious that there is some kind of familiarity between them, despite never meeting in real life, and they get closer by the end of the film, where it says To Be Continued... (concluding in the sequel Faraway, So Close!). Throughout the film, Columbo actor Peter Falk shows up to give his incites into city and human life, with a strange knowledge for everything, including the existence of angels, apparently he used to be one himself. Also starring Curt Bois as Homer the aged poet. Ganz gives a good sensitive performance as the angel wanting to be human and in love, Dommartin is nice as his love interest, and Falk is witty and likable as himself. The film was remade in a few aspects into the Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan film City of Angels, the romantic element certainly, and despite some of the story being a little predictable, there are some great small effects and cinematography, it a worthwhile fantasy drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language. Good!

    This is a 1987 Franco-German film directed by Wim Wenders. It's one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Hollywood made a horrible remake in 1998, titled City of Angels, starring Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan. Nothing good comes out of it except for the soundtrack (in which Sarah McLachlan wrote and performed the song Angel). You could watch both version so that you can understand the 'miracle works' of (bad) Hollywood. :p I think all the words in this film are quotes, gosh they're so beautiful, and real, so true. No wonder the script is terribly good; Austrian novelist and playwright - Peter Handke, co-wrote the script. Not to mention the music, stunning!

    To describe today's troubling economy, one could say, as the poet Homer says in Wings of Desire: "The world seems to be sinking into dusk, but I tell the stories as in the beginning in my sing-song voice which sustains me, protected by the tale from the troubling present." This is only one example of many of the cinematic poetry used in Wim Wender's Wings of Desire. Homer is very reminiscent of another "Homer": The author of the Iliad. All of his dialog and even his blocking from the library scene to the couch in the middle of the field is pure poetry. In fact, the film itself is bookended in poetry. The movie starts with an angel Damiel writing in his journal" when the child was still a child" he had questions about the world, was not picky, and was generally more cooperative. The tale is told in German in a "sing-song" voice, "Als Das kind kind war..." He sits next to his Angel friend Cassiel (played by Otto Sadler, who previously starred in the epic movie Das Boot) in a convertible with the light reflecting off the windshield in such a way that it looks like wings. Damiel and Cassiel compare notes of what they have witnessed. The angels move around unseen among the people of Berlin, reading people's thoughts and whispering comforting words to people. The people too, are not completely seen by the angels. The angels can only view the world in black and white. While privy to all that will happen in the world and to immortality, angels do not know what it is like to feel, to taste, or to be acknowledged by a stranger. Damiel tells Cassiel that while it is great to live for eternity, he sometimes gets fed up with his spiritual existence. He longs to have blackened fingers from the newspaper, to have a fever, or to be excited by a meal. Cassiel reminds him that they are there to do no more that to preserve, collect, and testify. This too is poetry. The angels like to spend much time in the library. The library is full of books of knowledge and therefore seen as a sacred place. They are seen whispering to people who are reading, perhaps trying to inspire them. The irony is that the books contain text which the angels can see. Text, like the angels, can inspire a person only if he or she is open to it. Ironically, even though human beings cannot see angels, the angels, even though they read thoughts, cannot see the pictures painted by the imagination in the minds of the humans when reading text. Damiel yearns to be human even more when he goes to the circus and falls in love with his own angel: a trapeze artist that is dressed like an angel. He tells Cassiel that he wants to be human. Cassiel, in another example of cinematic poetry, brings albeit reluctantly, Damiel through the Berlin wall where he transforms to the human state and everything turns to color. Damiel and Cassiel are as symbolic as the Berlin wall that they pass through, as they are opposites. Damiel, free like the West, full of dreams and the desire to choose. Cassiel on the other hand is like the East: Rigid, does as instructed, no free thought or desires. Meanwhile in a subplot, the angels have been following Peter Falk who has come to Germany to make a film. Falk tells Damiel, "I can't see you, but I know that you are there." When Damiel turns human, he looks up Peter Falk and Falk reveals that he too used to be an angel. When Damiel asks him what to do or expect, Falk tells him that he has to figure it out and that's what makes it fun. Damiel leaves to go find his trapeze artist. After a series of near misses, Damiel and his trapeze artist end up at the same bar. Meanwhile, in another example of cinematic poetry, Cassiel closes his eyes in the bar and then the stage lights cast three different shadows off his body, alternating and shifting location and color as if the audience is watching him break into pieces. Lastly, after Damiel and the trapeze artist do you unite, they are seen together as she glides on the trapeze with artistic beauty and in another poetic motion, their shadows are seen dancing representing the visible and only partly visible, but as the shadows suggest that they are only partly visible, that is part of the fun.

    "Wings Of Desire" is probably New German Cinema director Wim Wenders' most famous film, the one by the director Germany is most proud of. For many, it's one of the very best films ever made coming out of the country, and one of the most beautiful art-house accomplishments of the last thirty years. It stars Bruno Ganz, Otto Sander, and Peter Falk, who appears as himself. Every day two angels wander the city of Berlin, listening to people's thoughts and following whoever they choose to. The angels can't interfere with the lives of humans, nor can they feel their emotions. It seems that only children are able to see them, as well as other angels who roam the city. One of the angels sees a trapeze artist in a circus, and after listening to her thoughts, he decides he now passionately aspires to be human, to feel a weight under his feet and to be able to experience the daily small pleasures he until then had only witnessed. Visually, the film is stunning: it's hard to forget the grace of the camera work accompanying the angels during their wanderings, as it gives a feeling of floating as if we were a third angel watching. The shifts between aerial shots (seen more in the first half of the film) and ground ones, and the shifts between gorgeous black-and-white and color &not;the first look symbolizing the angel's point of view, while the second symbolizing the immersions into the real world are other noticeable, auteur-ish touches. The score, although not as present as it should, is beautifully angelic, and the whispered, quiet sound design in the black-and-white scenes evoke a sublime sense of peace and harmony. But the whispers themselves, looking at the whole of them, form a big picture that is vividly human, and are a faithful text to our emotional palette in today's day. The different people the angels listen to are of all kind, many of them feeling lonely, gloomy, or just immersed in their problems and inner conflicts. Even though there's little positivity, this doesn't stop one of the angels, Damiel, from being attracted to mortality, to its flawed and fragile existence. It's a film that reminds us of how much of a blessing it is to be in this world in the first place, and it does so with such amazing grace and beauty. "Wings Of Desire" is one of the precious films that is truly full of positivity. It's a film that deserves praise for both its larger-than-life concepts, narrated with a strange, otherworldly lyricism, and its small accomplishments, like the warm smiles of Bruno Ganz and Peter Falk.

    please people, do not write a review if you stopped watching the movie half way through, because you know nothing of what you write about. this film IS very boring. IS very slow. if you can just get over that and watch it for watching sake, then it ranks as a very high quality flick. there are moments when you can be completely immersed into the feeling of the actors/actress. you do not forget this film very easily, and can always come back to it in moments of your life and reflect at the script writings accuracy as it relates to everyday life. putting Peter in was quite a break from the intensity of reading the subs. i can only feel that a very good dubbed version may have helped me appreciate the visuals more, but then, i can always watch it again. my one piece of advice? if you can watch this in segments over a few days,

    I've recently seen Wings of Desire again. Apart from the obvious artistic merit and grinding slow tempo, it struck me how it had historical importance that hadn't been perceived at the time of filming. Probably no one in the crew believed that Germany would unify a couple of years after the premiere and that Berlin would become whole again. I had the opportunity to visit the city several times in the first decade of 21st century and it is definitely not Berlin from Wings of Desire. With a comforting premise that angels are watching over us, we follow them during their usual day. Although they don't always succeed in keeping us happy, they try their best in making our life on this Earth easier. One of them longs for human experience and is even willing to trade the eternity and sterile knowledge of all things for it. And each second of the story about it transpires with the lust for life and the love for Berlin. The closing titles reveal a dedication to Yasujirō Ozu, Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut, and Andrei Tarkovsky. This might explain the slow tempo, which is in my opinion the only thing in Wings of Desire that didn't stand the test of time. This, in turn, deducts two stars from the perfect note.

    I was truly captivated for the first forty minutes of this film. As the camera seemed to sweep around the city of Berlin taking in the internal dialogue of all it encountered. The crowning moment of the opening scenes was a section filmed in the city Library which was just breathtaking. After this I quickly became bored. Apart from a brilliant cameo from Peter Faulk and a great scene in a Nick Cave gig the film's themes had little more to offer me. The cinematography was excellent throughout however, with a memorable shot of a bus in the twilight and a few timely transitions from black and white to colour. I would like to see this film cut back to a nice little 20 minute short. My Mother in Law disagrees on this point and thought the film was just perfect. Worth a stab but prepare for tedium. (The film... not my mother in law)

    In my opinion, this otherwise very well-crafted movie was totally spoiled by the self-conscious, heavy-handed performance of Solveig Dommartin, who unfortunately had way too much screen time. The awkwardness of her performance reaches a painful apogee in the scene in the club. I found her egoistic style of acting very embarrassing, and it ruined the movie for me. Too bad, because the performance of Bruno Ganz, the cinematography, the script and the score had great potential. To me it is an exemplar of how one bad performance can poison everything else. I found it very difficult to become engaged in this movie.

    I'd read a lot of good things about Wings of Desire, so when I finally got around to buying a copy of the film expectations were high. I know it's lame, but straight away I'm going to say that my favourite film of all time is probably Nicholas Roeg's 'Walkabout'. Why would I make that point? It's really just to make clear that I'm not automatically dismissive of films that aren't event driven, or feature long periods where nothing much happens. In some ways Wings of Desire isn't really about all that much and I'm not even going to try to explain the few things which do happen in the film. In another sense it's a film about absolutely everything and your interpretation and feelings toward the movie are going to depend largely on your own personality, what you expect from it and various other factors, including what sort of day you've had (it's very easy to space out during this movie!). The first two thirds of the movie are spent wondering what it is you're actually watching, as there's not really much in the way of dialogue (at least not much of interest). The final third of the film gives us some sort of resolve to the film, although really by this point most viewers are likely to be bored out of their mind. If I had to pick a scene which sums the movie up then it'd have to be the one where the angels are discussing what it is they lack in their existence. It seemed to go on forever and I couldn't really have cared less by the end of it, because they cite too many examples. If you think this sounds harsh, take a look through the quotes section on this movie to get an idea of what you'll be hearing throughout. There's no doubting that this film is well filmed and visually it's very impressive. It's an unusual film too and one which immediately grabs your attention. However, despite these qualities, the 'introduction' is just far too long and drawn out. The director could easily have covered the first hour in about 15 minutes. And I know some people would argue that this is to give us a sense of what it's like to live forever and all the rest, but it's really not necessary. In movies there are ways of conveying long periods of time. Flashbacks, a montage etc. But there's really no excuse for the way this movie starts, it takes forever to get going and the ending is totally unsatisfying. If you like your movies arty then check it out for the visuals alone, but if you like some sort of entertainment or something which is actually going to occupy your brain in some way then I'd avoid it.

Visually, the film is stunning: it's hard to forget the grace of the camera work accompanying the angels during their wanderings, as it gives a feeling of floating as if we were a third angel watching. The shifts between aerial shots (seen more in the first half of the film) and ground ones, and the shifts between gorgeous black-and-white and color &not;the first look symbolizing the angel's point of view, while the second symbolizing the immersions into the real world are other noticeable, auteur-ish touches. The score, although not as present as it should, is beautifully angelic, and the whispered, quiet sound design in the black-and-white scenes evoke a sublime sense of peace and harmony. But the whispers themselves, looking at the whole of them, form a big picture that is vividly human, and are a faithful text to our emotional palette in today's day. The different people the angels listen to are of all kind, many of them feeling lonely, gloomy, or just immersed in their problems and inner conflicts. Even though there's little positivity, this doesn't stop one of the angels, Damiel, from being attracted to mortality, to its flawed and fragile existence. It's a film that reminds us of how much of a blessing it is to be in this world in the first place, and it does so with such amazing grace and beauty. "Wings Of Desire" is one of the precious films that is truly full of positivity. It's a film that deserves praise for both its larger-than-life concepts, narrated with a strange, otherworldly lyricism, and its small accomplishments, like the warm smiles of Bruno Ganz and Peter Falk.

    please people, do not write a review if you stopped watching the movie half way through, because you know nothing of what you write about. this film IS very boring. IS very slow. if you can just get over that and watch it for watching sake, then it ranks as a very high quality flick. there are moments when you can be completely immersed into the feeling of the actors/actress. you do not forget this film very easily, and can always come back to it in moments of your life and reflect at the script writings accuracy as it relates to everyday life. putting Peter in was quite a break from the intensity of reading the subs. i can only feel that a very good dubbed version may have helped me appreciate the visuals more, but then, i can always watch it again. my one piece of advice? if you can watch this in segments over a few days,

    I've recently seen Wings of Desire again. Apart from the obvious artistic merit and grinding slow tempo, it struck me how it had historical importance that hadn't been perceived at the time of filming. Probably no one in the crew believed that Germany would unify a couple of years after the premiere and that Berlin would become whole again. I had the opportunity to visit the city several times in the first decade of 21st century and it is definitely not Berlin from Wings of Desire. With a comforting premise that angels are watching over us, we follow them during their usual day. Although they don't always succeed in keeping us happy, they try their best in making our life on this Earth easier. One of them longs for human experience and is even willing to trade the eternity and sterile knowledge of all things for it. And each second of the story about it transpires with the lust for life and the love for Berlin. The closing titles reveal a dedication to Yasujirō Ozu, Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut, and Andrei Tarkovsky. This might explain the slow tempo, which is in my opinion the only thing in Wings of Desire that didn't stand the test of time. This, in turn, deducts two stars from the perfect note.

    I was truly captivated for the first forty minutes of this film. As the camera seemed to sweep around the city of Berlin taking in the internal dialogue of all it encountered. The crowning moment of the opening scenes was a section filmed in the city Library which was just breathtaking. After this I quickly became bored. Apart from a brilliant cameo from Peter Faulk and a great scene in a Nick Cave gig the film's themes had little more to offer me. The cinematography was excellent throughout however, with a memorable shot of a bus in the twilight and a few timely transitions from black and white to colour. I would like to see this film cut back to a nice little 20 minute short. My Mother in Law disagrees on this point and thought the film was just perfect. Worth a stab but prepare for tedium. (The film... not my mother in law)

    In my opinion, this otherwise very well-crafted movie was totally spoiled by the self-conscious, heavy-handed performance of Solveig Dommartin, who unfortunately had way too much screen time. The awkwardness of her performance reaches a painful apogee in the scene in the club. I found her egoistic style of acting very embarrassing, and it ruined the movie for me. Too bad, because the performance of Bruno Ganz, the cinematography, the script and the score had great potential. To me it is an exemplar of how one bad performance can poison everything else. I found it very difficult to become engaged in this movie.

    I'd read a lot of good things about Wings of Desire, so when I finally got around to buying a copy of the film expectations were high. I know it's lame, but straight away I'm going to say that my favourite film of all time is probably Nicholas Roeg's 'Walkabout'. Why would I make that point? It's really just to make clear that I'm not automatically dismissive of films that aren't event driven, or feature long periods where nothing much happens. In some ways Wings of Desire isn't really about all that much and I'm not even going to try to explain the few things which do happen in the film. In another sense it's a film about absolutely everything and your interpretation and feelings toward the movie are going to depend largely on your own personality, what you expect from it and various other factors, including what sort of day you've had (it's very easy to space out during this movie!). The first two thirds of the movie are spent wondering what it is you're actually watching, as there's not really much in the way of dialogue (at least not much of interest). The final third of the film gives us some sort of resolve to the film, although really by this point most viewers are likely to be bored out of their mind. If I had to pick a scene which sums the movie up then it'd have to be the one where the angels are discussing what it is they lack in their existence. It seemed to go on forever and I couldn't really have cared less by the end of it, because they cite too many examples. If you think this sounds harsh, take a look through the quotes section on this movie to get an idea of what you'll be hearing throughout. There's no doubting that this film is well filmed and visually it's very impressive. It's an unusual film too and one which immediately grabs your attention. However, despite these qualities, the 'introduction' is just far too long and drawn out. The director could easily have covered the first hour in about 15 minutes. And I know some people would argue that this is to give us a sense of what it's like to live forever and all the rest, but it's really not necessary. In movies there are ways of conveying long periods of time. Flashbacks, a montage etc. But there's really no excuse for the way this movie starts, it takes forever to get going and the ending is totally unsatisfying. If you like your movies arty then check it out for the visuals alone, but if you like some sort of entertainment or something which is actually going to occupy your brain in some way then I'd avoid it.

    Must try to keep this brief. Ganz is an angel who comes to Earth to have a look around Berlin in 1987. Not clear at first. No one notices him as he wanders about. Never speaks. Reads everyone else's thoughts but not like "Ulysses." Reads everyone's -- not just one person -- so gets multiple streams of multiple consciousnesses. Slightly confusing. Is this how we really think? Why am I me and why not you?...The inside is the outside...Why am I trapped in this daily web?...I have always been most alone when in a toilet...Where is that Dunkel I ordered?...What is this nonsense all about and why am I thinking it?...There is no use in living for tomorrow because today is tomorrow...Occasional superimpositions of a pair of angel wings to give us a hint that Ganz is a heavenly creature in case it takes us too long to figure it out as it did me...Wo deine zanfte Flugel weilt...Yes I said yes. Peter Falk plays himself as an actor in a movie being shot in Berlin. We can hear his thoughts too when Ganz is near him. His thoughts don't tap into the metaphysical though. They run more along the lines of, "How do I look in this hat?" Ganz watches a rock band, follows a dying old man around, strolls through a library, watches kids at play -- all accompanied by rivulets of consciousness -- "Oh, weh, isn't this where the Potsdamer Platz used to be?" He watches a circus act and falls for a beautiful and supple trapeze artist. He decides to give up his angel hood and become human, and he meets the girl again while both of them are real and she takes Ganz home with her. A trapeze artist. I'll bet that was some big SURPRISE for an ex angel! Don't watch this if you lack patience.

    From director Wim Wenders (The American Friend; Paris, Texas), the title of this German film sounded like something that would be highly rated by the critics, especially appearing in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was only rated three out of five stars, but it wasn't going to stop me watching it. Basically in contemporary West Germany, while the Berlin Wall still stood, Damiel (Downfall's Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) are two angels invisible to all humans, besides very young children and people close to death, and they wander the city watching various people. They give help to the lonely and depressed souls that they can, but Damiel has become unhappy with the centuries of immortality and longs to become a human so he can blend into the world he adores and is fascinated by so much. One of the biggest reasons he wants to experience the joys of everyday human life is because he has been watching in particular lonely circus trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he has fallen in love with her, but of course physical interaction is impossible. Cassiel also wishes to be human as well, but Damiel is able to strip himself of his immortality, and he wakes up from the black and white into the colourful real world and experiences at last what it is like to be human, bleeding, eating food and drinking coffee, and wearing regular clothing. Cassiel meanwhile unintentionally finds himself connected with a young man who wants to commit suicide, but still an angel he cannot do anything to stop him, and when he does take his own life Cassiel is haunted by event. Damiel finally gets to meet Marion in person, and it is obvious that there is some kind of familiarity between them, despite never meeting in real life, and they get closer by the end of the film, where it says To Be Continued... (concluding in the sequel Faraway, So Close!). Throughout the film, Columbo actor Peter Falk shows up to give his incites into city and human life, with a strange knowledge for everything, including the existence of angels, apparently he used to be one himself. Also starring Curt Bois as Homer the aged poet. Ganz gives a good sensitive performance as the angel wanting to be human and in love, Dommartin is nice as his love interest, and Falk is witty and likable as himself. The film was remade in a few aspects into the Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan film City of Angels, the romantic element certainly, and despite some of the story being a little predictable, there are some great small effects and cinematography, it a worthwhile fantasy drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language. Good!
