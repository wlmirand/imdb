    The only problem with this movie is Dennis Miller. Well, then there is Corey Feldman, O.K. the only two problems with this movie are Dennis Miller and Corey Feldman. The actual story, y'know, the story the producers should have gone with, is the story of the TV preacher played by Chris Sarandon and his deal with Angie Everhart's Lilith. That's the story, that's where all the life is. Dennis Miller seems merely inserted into the action, like he got some points in his contract where he gets his own movie in exchange for services to be rendered later, so he is retrofitted into some script, in this case a Tales From The Crypt thing. It all comes off so forced and superfluous to the plot. That and Dennis Miller has no charisma, he's is an unpleasant little man devoid of life and vitality. But you do get to see some titties.

    Words cannot describe just how bad this thing is. The plot is nonsensical, the characters empty, the dialogue beyond moronic, the action boring, the scares non-existent, the humour completely absent. Add to that poor direction and some of the most confusing editing ever witnessed in cinema... This is an orgy of stupidity and bad taste. It boggles the mind how a project like this ever got greenlighted. Nothing in this film makes sense and apart from the stupidity one can't help but notice the nudity. I suppose the target audience for this were males between the ages of 12 and 16, with raging hormones, IQ below 70, and no sex life.

    The cryptkeeper (John Kassir) returns to tell the story of a funeral parlor that moonlights as a vampire bordello. Look at this amazing cast: Chris Sarandon, Corey Feldman, Dennis Miller, Angie Everhart, William Sadler and more... just wanted to point that out. Despite an overall bad film, this cast simply guarantees an enjoyable performance here and there. The film borrows somewhat from "Night Shift" (using a funeral home as a source of prostitution), and parallels "Dusk Till Dawn" with its use of loose women as vampires. I say parallels because the films came out the same year and I will just have to assume that any similarity in idea was purely coincidental. I do love that Feldman was quoted as saying Miller was a jerk on set. While I do not doubt this, Feldman himself has quite the reputation for being disrespectful to his fans. (I could share stories about his behavior at conventions, but that would be personal and beside the point.) Perhaps the most interesting thing about this film is that apparently Jewish Stars of David have no affect on vampires whereas crosses do. This suggests that the Jewish faith is false and Christianity is the true way. Maybe I am assuming too much, but I have always found that fascinating how vampire tales reinforce the Christian religion, despite vampires themselves not being a part of the Bible.

    Corey Feldman is still depressed about not being in a film with Corey Haim for a while, so decides to go to a house of pleasure with some friends to relieve all the anxieties. Turns out its a cut price version of the bar from Dusk Til Dawn, minus Gringos and Salma Hayek. After a few days, his sister, Virginal Erika Eleniak (great casting), hires Dennis Miller (not famous in the UK) and decides to find out what happened and what is going on. Turns out Jerry Dandridge is now a priest and wants to get rid of all ill willers, but Lilith has other plans, but her heart needs to be cut in four, and it gets quite confusing. But to be fair, it's a pretty short film, and it's all good fun while it lasts. The cast, apart from Sarandon, are all pretty dire, even Feldman, and Miller, whoever he is just spouts out one liners every now and again, but I have this feeling he's a pretty big thing in the States, just like Alan Carr is here (exactley). If you like films that are easy on the eye, choc full of things for the lads, and never bothering the grey matter, you could do a lot worse than this. Otherwise, don't bother.

    "Bordello of Blood" does offer some undemanding B movie entertainment, even if it's never quite as much fun as one might like it to be. At least it never pretends to take itself very seriously, and star Dennis Miller, playing wise ass, low rent private eye Rafe Guttman, apparently concocted much of his sardonic dialogue himself. Rafe is hired by uptight Katherine Verdoux (Erika Eleniak) to locate her indolent brother Caleb (a well cast Corey Feldman), and tracks him to the mortuary, doubling as a bordello, where Caleb is last seen, tangling with evil boss vampire Lilith (Angie Everhart) and teaming up with slick televangelist J.C. Current (Chris Sarandon). While it's not really all that funny, the attempt by Miller and company to give their material that tongue in cheek flavour is still appreciated. Things get off to a fine start with The Crypt Keeper joined by a mummy, played by the ever dependable William Sadler, the hero of the first 'Tales from the Crypt' movie, "Demon Knight". The actors are all quite entertaining to watch. The casting of Sarandon is a decent in-joke seeing that he was the charming vampire-next-door in "Fright Night" and is one of the vampire slayers here. Feldman fans may be disappointed that he's only around for the first and final thirds, but he IS a hoot and makes the most of his brief screen time. Sexy Everheart clearly is relishing the role of the blood sucking babe; she, Eleniak, Kiara Hunter, Leslie Ann Phillips, and Juliet Reagh provide delectable eye candy. Supporting performances by Aubrey Morris (as McCutcheon) and Phil Fondacaro (as Vincent) are quite amusing. The gore effects are very entertaining and the soundtrack features some solid vintage and then-current rock tunes. Gilbert Adler, one of the producers of the TV series, made his feature film directing debut here, and does a decent job. Overall, the movie is a perfectly acceptable combination of sex, gore, and humour, and the pacing stays pretty consistent throughout. It's not as good as "Demon Knight", but it's not bad either. Be sure to watch out for the uncredited cameo appearance by Oscar winning actress Whoopi Goldberg. Seven out of 10.

    If you love horror movies like me, you'll love this flick. It is everything a real horror/ comedy buff can expect: 1. Cool jokes and gore galore; 2. Beautiful naked girls; 3. Creepy evildoers and sinister places; 4. Great heroes and Super villains; 5. A lot of profanity and cool deaths; 6. Nice old school special effects - and best of all : no CGI!!! and good acting throughout the movie :) 7. Sexy/ hot/ lustful blood-thirsty vampires. Don't expect: 1. The answer to deep (pseudo)philosophical questions, food for thought or fake /teen horror; 2. It is neither for the squeamish nor the highbrow; 3. Oscar award BS material; 4. Fake CGI blood; 5. Dream-like sequences BS; All in all, just for those who love horror! :)

    The Good News: Well, this was an unexpected surprise. I'm normally not the biggest fan of vampire movies, and this one is a lot of fun to watch. It's a goofy, entertaining film that doesn't really offer more than disposable viewing. The plot moves along at fast enough pace where something is always going on and it keeps the interest level very high. The film is also pretty gory, and it has a lot of blood spilled. Decapitations, staking, hearts ripped out, and bodies set on fire that it's just an over-the-top gore display. There's something here for every type of gore-fan, and nothing is left uncovered. It's a great film for gore-hounds. The "Tales from the Crypt" tag gives it a comedic tag, and for the most part, it's also very funny. The jokes fly nonstop, have a nice sharp turn to them, and actually get more than just a chuckle from them. It's a def mix of the two, and is even more remarkable in that it pulls it off so well. The action is also pretty fast and furious. The ending assault in the bordello is a great example, keeping it from being overly gruesome while also maintaining the sharp collection of explosions, guts and gore that the rest of the film has. Most important, though, is it's cheese appeal. It's not a very strong story, and more than a few moments are there just for a cheesy feel to them, and it makes the film that much better. http://matcao.com The Bad News: There really wasn't a while lot not to like about this one. It's basically just a fan-friendly film that features enough to entertain without requiring extensive over-analyzing. It's the type of film that will appeal to those who like it and will be criticized because of it. The Final Verdict: Sure, this is a cheesy B-movie, but it's chock full of what makes those kinds of films fun. It's violent, funny, and more, and is just supposed to be a fun time. Take it as that, and it becomes a much more fun time.

    Blood, breasts, vampires and Chris Sarandon. How can you go wrong? "Bordello of Blood," the second "Tales From The Crypt" feature film, supplies the viewer with ample amounts of all of the above, leaving room for little else. What it lacks in story, it more than makes up for in its cheap thrills, and as far as midnight guilty pleasures go, this one is about as good as it gets. The story revolves around a good-girl (Erika Eleniak) whose delinquent brother (Corey Feldman) goes missing. Upon hiring a wise-cracking private detective, it is revealed that a local morgue is housing a brothel run by a gang of beautiful but deadly vampires. Armed with super-soakers full of holy water and with the help of a guitar-slinging reverend (Chris Sarandon), the two set out to put the joint out of business once and for all. Dennis Miller is essentially playing himself, but keeps the humor pumping through the film's ridiculous premise. Chris Sarandon, likewise, is in top form as the genre hero he truly is. As mentioned before, there's plenty of bare-flesh and red-stuff to go around, and if that sort of thing is your bag, you'll have a blast with "Bordello of Blood." Take it for the cheap thrill ride it is.

    Tales From the Crypt should always be taken for what it is... entertainment in horror fashion by appealing to underage people with juvenile humor and absurd plots. And I down that spoonful every time. The running time flies by without hesitation that I have repeated viewings of this movie to see what I missed, and it has grown on me as if Angie Everheart's fangs have sunken themselves into my jugular. Angie's acting is horrendous as this is her feature debut but as long as her body talks who cares what is said. Dennis Miller provides his own variation to the know-it-all gumshoe, but could've faired better by losing the tight stonewashed jeans and slipped into some slacks. His humor goes beyond the average 16 year old that this film should've based its audience around, but he is trying to reach a higher level after all above this schlock. Erika Elenik as a televangelist producer... spot on in the absurdity! Corey Feldman and Chris Sarandon were apparently in on the joke for they just absorb the role and play it for the s**t and giggles as it is. Being a self-professed TFTC fanatic, I enjoyed the in-jokes that are within this movie (especially the key from Demon Knight) but the in-jokes were not essential as they are to other films (such as Kevin Smith flicks). This movie was never aimed to mentally impair you with horrific images, it was made for the fore-mentioned crowd and should be taken in that same vein... just make sure Angie Everheart is sucking from it

    I was surprised to notice that this flick has a low rating. Overall the movie wasn't bad at all. But you have to understand Tales From The Crypt. It is more black comedy than horror of course, starting with the crypt keeper. So many people out there find that guy annoying. He doesn't bore me, I was lucky to meet the crypt keeper in real life, John Kassir is his name, a really nice guy. Why is everybody on his back? The movie itself is never gory of course but it delivers a lot of blood and in this case a lot of nudity, if you have the full uncut version, here in Europe the movie is cut with 20 minutes. Just for the tits, weird. It's full of one liners just like the crypt keeper himself, when the master vampire, who works at a bordello, puts her tongue into a guys throat she goes search his heart with her tongue, of course he dies, and she said, men likes women who goes deep throat. Another example is cutting of the head of a guy by saying, I love men giving me head. and that's what most people hate about this movie, the one liners. I though it was a great movie, great effects and great performances, sad but true, when I visited LA I visited the church used in this film, never saw Lilith...

Corey Feldman and Chris Sarandon were apparently in on the joke for they just absorb the role and play it for the s**t and giggles as it is. Being a self-professed TFTC fanatic, I enjoyed the in-jokes that are within this movie (especially the key from Demon Knight) but the in-jokes were not essential as they are to other films (such as Kevin Smith flicks). This movie was never aimed to mentally impair you with horrific images, it was made for the fore-mentioned crowd and should be taken in that same vein... just make sure Angie Everheart is sucking from it

    I was surprised to notice that this flick has a low rating. Overall the movie wasn't bad at all. But you have to understand Tales From The Crypt. It is more black comedy than horror of course, starting with the crypt keeper. So many people out there find that guy annoying. He doesn't bore me, I was lucky to meet the crypt keeper in real life, John Kassir is his name, a really nice guy. Why is everybody on his back? The movie itself is never gory of course but it delivers a lot of blood and in this case a lot of nudity, if you have the full uncut version, here in Europe the movie is cut with 20 minutes. Just for the tits, weird. It's full of one liners just like the crypt keeper himself, when the master vampire, who works at a bordello, puts her tongue into a guys throat she goes search his heart with her tongue, of course he dies, and she said, men likes women who goes deep throat. Another example is cutting of the head of a guy by saying, I love men giving me head. and that's what most people hate about this movie, the one liners. I though it was a great movie, great effects and great performances, sad but true, when I visited LA I visited the church used in this film, never saw Lilith...

    The only problem with this movie is Dennis Miller. Well, then there is Corey Feldman, O.K. the only two problems with this movie are Dennis Miller and Corey Feldman. The actual story, y'know, the story the producers should have gone with, is the story of the TV preacher played by Chris Sarandon and his deal with Angie Everhart's Lilith. That's the story, that's where all the life is. Dennis Miller seems merely inserted into the action, like he got some points in his contract where he gets his own movie in exchange for services to be rendered later, so he is retrofitted into some script, in this case a Tales From The Crypt thing. It all comes off so forced and superfluous to the plot. That and Dennis Miller has no charisma, he's is an unpleasant little man devoid of life and vitality. But you do get to see some titties.

    Words cannot describe just how bad this thing is. The plot is nonsensical, the characters empty, the dialogue beyond moronic, the action boring, the scares non-existent, the humour completely absent. Add to that poor direction and some of the most confusing editing ever witnessed in cinema... This is an orgy of stupidity and bad taste. It boggles the mind how a project like this ever got greenlighted. Nothing in this film makes sense and apart from the stupidity one can't help but notice the nudity. I suppose the target audience for this were males between the ages of 12 and 16, with raging hormones, IQ below 70, and no sex life.

    The cryptkeeper (John Kassir) returns to tell the story of a funeral parlor that moonlights as a vampire bordello. Look at this amazing cast: Chris Sarandon, Corey Feldman, Dennis Miller, Angie Everhart, William Sadler and more... just wanted to point that out. Despite an overall bad film, this cast simply guarantees an enjoyable performance here and there. The film borrows somewhat from "Night Shift" (using a funeral home as a source of prostitution), and parallels "Dusk Till Dawn" with its use of loose women as vampires. I say parallels because the films came out the same year and I will just have to assume that any similarity in idea was purely coincidental. I do love that Feldman was quoted as saying Miller was a jerk on set. While I do not doubt this, Feldman himself has quite the reputation for being disrespectful to his fans. (I could share stories about his behavior at conventions, but that would be personal and beside the point.) Perhaps the most interesting thing about this film is that apparently Jewish Stars of David have no affect on vampires whereas crosses do. This suggests that the Jewish faith is false and Christianity is the true way. Maybe I am assuming too much, but I have always found that fascinating how vampire tales reinforce the Christian religion, despite vampires themselves not being a part of the Bible.

    Corey Feldman is still depressed about not being in a film with Corey Haim for a while, so decides to go to a house of pleasure with some friends to relieve all the anxieties. Turns out its a cut price version of the bar from Dusk Til Dawn, minus Gringos and Salma Hayek. After a few days, his sister, Virginal Erika Eleniak (great casting), hires Dennis Miller (not famous in the UK) and decides to find out what happened and what is going on. Turns out Jerry Dandridge is now a priest and wants to get rid of all ill willers, but Lilith has other plans, but her heart needs to be cut in four, and it gets quite confusing. But to be fair, it's a pretty short film, and it's all good fun while it lasts. The cast, apart from Sarandon, are all pretty dire, even Feldman, and Miller, whoever he is just spouts out one liners every now and again, but I have this feeling he's a pretty big thing in the States, just like Alan Carr is here (exactley). If you like films that are easy on the eye, choc full of things for the lads, and never bothering the grey matter, you could do a lot worse than this. Otherwise, don't bother.

    "Bordello of Blood" does offer some undemanding B movie entertainment, even if it's never quite as much fun as one might like it to be. At least it never pretends to take itself very seriously, and star Dennis Miller, playing wise ass, low rent private eye Rafe Guttman, apparently concocted much of his sardonic dialogue himself. Rafe is hired by uptight Katherine Verdoux (Erika Eleniak) to locate her indolent brother Caleb (a well cast Corey Feldman), and tracks him to the mortuary, doubling as a bordello, where Caleb is last seen, tangling with evil boss vampire Lilith (Angie Everhart) and teaming up with slick televangelist J.C. Current (Chris Sarandon). While it's not really all that funny, the attempt by Miller and company to give their material that tongue in cheek flavour is still appreciated. Things get off to a fine start with The Crypt Keeper joined by a mummy, played by the ever dependable William Sadler, the hero of the first 'Tales from the Crypt' movie, "Demon Knight". The actors are all quite entertaining to watch. The casting of Sarandon is a decent in-joke seeing that he was the charming vampire-next-door in "Fright Night" and is one of the vampire slayers here. Feldman fans may be disappointed that he's only around for the first and final thirds, but he IS a hoot and makes the most of his brief screen time. Sexy Everheart clearly is relishing the role of the blood sucking babe; she, Eleniak, Kiara Hunter, Leslie Ann Phillips, and Juliet Reagh provide delectable eye candy. Supporting performances by Aubrey Morris (as McCutcheon) and Phil Fondacaro (as Vincent) are quite amusing. The gore effects are very entertaining and the soundtrack features some solid vintage and then-current rock tunes. Gilbert Adler, one of the producers of the TV series, made his feature film directing debut here, and does a decent job. Overall, the movie is a perfectly acceptable combination of sex, gore, and humour, and the pacing stays pretty consistent throughout. It's not as good as "Demon Knight", but it's not bad either. Be sure to watch out for the uncredited cameo appearance by Oscar winning actress Whoopi Goldberg. Seven out of 10.

    If you love horror movies like me, you'll love this flick. It is everything a real horror/ comedy buff can expect: 1. Cool jokes and gore galore; 2. Beautiful naked girls; 3. Creepy evildoers and sinister places; 4. Great heroes and Super villains; 5. A lot of profanity and cool deaths; 6. Nice old school special effects - and best of all : no CGI!!! and good acting throughout the movie :) 7. Sexy/ hot/ lustful blood-thirsty vampires. Don't expect: 1. The answer to deep (pseudo)philosophical questions, food for thought or fake /teen horror; 2. It is neither for the squeamish nor the highbrow; 3. Oscar award BS material; 4. Fake CGI blood; 5. Dream-like sequences BS; All in all, just for those who love horror! :)

    The Good News: Well, this was an unexpected surprise. I'm normally not the biggest fan of vampire movies, and this one is a lot of fun to watch. It's a goofy, entertaining film that doesn't really offer more than disposable viewing. The plot moves along at fast enough pace where something is always going on and it keeps the interest level very high. The film is also pretty gory, and it has a lot of blood spilled. Decapitations, staking, hearts ripped out, and bodies set on fire that it's just an over-the-top gore display. There's something here for every type of gore-fan, and nothing is left uncovered. It's a great film for gore-hounds. The "Tales from the Crypt" tag gives it a comedic tag, and for the most part, it's also very funny. The jokes fly nonstop, have a nice sharp turn to them, and actually get more than just a chuckle from them. It's a def mix of the two, and is even more remarkable in that it pulls it off so well. The action is also pretty fast and furious. The ending assault in the bordello is a great example, keeping it from being overly gruesome while also maintaining the sharp collection of explosions, guts and gore that the rest of the film has. Most important, though, is it's cheese appeal. It's not a very strong story, and more than a few moments are there just for a cheesy feel to them, and it makes the film that much better. http://matcao.com The Bad News: There really wasn't a while lot not to like about this one. It's basically just a fan-friendly film that features enough to entertain without requiring extensive over-analyzing. It's the type of film that will appeal to those who like it and will be criticized because of it. The Final Verdict: Sure, this is a cheesy B-movie, but it's chock full of what makes those kinds of films fun. It's violent, funny, and more, and is just supposed to be a fun time. Take it as that, and it becomes a much more fun time.

    Blood, breasts, vampires and Chris Sarandon. How can you go wrong? "Bordello of Blood," the second "Tales From The Crypt" feature film, supplies the viewer with ample amounts of all of the above, leaving room for little else. What it lacks in story, it more than makes up for in its cheap thrills, and as far as midnight guilty pleasures go, this one is about as good as it gets. The story revolves around a good-girl (Erika Eleniak) whose delinquent brother (Corey Feldman) goes missing. Upon hiring a wise-cracking private detective, it is revealed that a local morgue is housing a brothel run by a gang of beautiful but deadly vampires. Armed with super-soakers full of holy water and with the help of a guitar-slinging reverend (Chris Sarandon), the two set out to put the joint out of business once and for all. Dennis Miller is essentially playing himself, but keeps the humor pumping through the film's ridiculous premise. Chris Sarandon, likewise, is in top form as the genre hero he truly is. As mentioned before, there's plenty of bare-flesh and red-stuff to go around, and if that sort of thing is your bag, you'll have a blast with "Bordello of Blood." Take it for the cheap thrill ride it is.

    Tales From the Crypt should always be taken for what it is... entertainment in horror fashion by appealing to underage people with juvenile humor and absurd plots. And I down that spoonful every time. The running time flies by without hesitation that I have repeated viewings of this movie to see what I missed, and it has grown on me as if Angie Everheart's fangs have sunken themselves into my jugular. Angie's acting is horrendous as this is her feature debut but as long as her body talks who cares what is said. Dennis Miller provides his own variation to the know-it-all gumshoe, but could've faired better by losing the tight stonewashed jeans and slipped into some slacks. His humor goes beyond the average 16 year old that this film should've based its audience around, but he is trying to reach a higher level after all above this schlock. Erika Elenik as a televangelist producer... spot on in the absurdity! Corey Feldman and Chris Sarandon were apparently in on the joke for they just absorb the role and play it for the s**t and giggles as it is.

Angie's acting is horrendous as this is her feature debut but as long as her body talks who cares what is said. Dennis Miller provides his own variation to the know-it-all gumshoe, but could've faired better by losing the tight stonewashed jeans and slipped into some slacks. His humor goes beyond the average 16 year old that this film should've based its audience around, but he is trying to reach a higher level after all above this schlock. Erika Elenik as a televangelist producer... spot on in the absurdity! Corey Feldman and Chris Sarandon were apparently in on the joke for they just absorb the role and play it for the s**t and giggles as it is. Being a self-professed TFTC fanatic, I enjoyed the in-jokes that are within this movie (especially the key from Demon Knight) but the in-jokes were not essential as they are to other films (such as Kevin Smith flicks). This movie was never aimed to mentally impair you with horrific images, it was made for the fore-mentioned crowd and should be taken in that same vein... just make sure Angie Everheart is sucking from it

    I was surprised to notice that this flick has a low rating. Overall the movie wasn't bad at all. But you have to understand Tales From The Crypt. It is more black comedy than horror of course, starting with the crypt keeper. So many people out there find that guy annoying. He doesn't bore me, I was lucky to meet the crypt keeper in real life, John Kassir is his name, a really nice guy. Why is everybody on his back? The movie itself is never gory of course but it delivers a lot of blood and in this case a lot of nudity, if you have the full uncut version, here in Europe the movie is cut with 20 minutes. Just for the tits, weird. It's full of one liners just like the crypt keeper himself, when the master vampire, who works at a bordello, puts her tongue into a guys throat she goes search his heart with her tongue, of course he dies, and she said, men likes women who goes deep throat. Another example is cutting of the head of a guy by saying, I love men giving me head. and that's what most people hate about this movie, the one liners. I though it was a great movie, great effects and great performances, sad but true, when I visited LA I visited the church used in this film, never saw Lilith...

    The only problem with this movie is Dennis Miller. Well, then there is Corey Feldman, O.K. the only two problems with this movie are Dennis Miller and Corey Feldman. The actual story, y'know, the story the producers should have gone with, is the story of the TV preacher played by Chris Sarandon and his deal with Angie Everhart's Lilith. That's the story, that's where all the life is. Dennis Miller seems merely inserted into the action, like he got some points in his contract where he gets his own movie in exchange for services to be rendered later, so he is retrofitted into some script, in this case a Tales From The Crypt thing. It all comes off so forced and superfluous to the plot. That and Dennis Miller has no charisma, he's is an unpleasant little man devoid of life and vitality. But you do get to see some titties.

    Words cannot describe just how bad this thing is. The plot is nonsensical, the characters empty, the dialogue beyond moronic, the action boring, the scares non-existent, the humour completely absent. Add to that poor direction and some of the most confusing editing ever witnessed in cinema... This is an orgy of stupidity and bad taste. It boggles the mind how a project like this ever got greenlighted. Nothing in this film makes sense and apart from the stupidity one can't help but notice the nudity. I suppose the target audience for this were males between the ages of 12 and 16, with raging hormones, IQ below 70, and no sex life.

    The cryptkeeper (John Kassir) returns to tell the story of a funeral parlor that moonlights as a vampire bordello. Look at this amazing cast: Chris Sarandon, Corey Feldman, Dennis Miller, Angie Everhart, William Sadler and more... just wanted to point that out. Despite an overall bad film, this cast simply guarantees an enjoyable performance here and there. The film borrows somewhat from "Night Shift" (using a funeral home as a source of prostitution), and parallels "Dusk Till Dawn" with its use of loose women as vampires. I say parallels because the films came out the same year and I will just have to assume that any similarity in idea was purely coincidental. I do love that Feldman was quoted as saying Miller was a jerk on set. While I do not doubt this, Feldman himself has quite the reputation for being disrespectful to his fans. (I could share stories about his behavior at conventions, but that would be personal and beside the point.) Perhaps the most interesting thing about this film is that apparently Jewish Stars of David have no affect on vampires whereas crosses do. This suggests that the Jewish faith is false and Christianity is the true way. Maybe I am assuming too much, but I have always found that fascinating how vampire tales reinforce the Christian religion, despite vampires themselves not being a part of the Bible.

    Corey Feldman is still depressed about not being in a film with Corey Haim for a while, so decides to go to a house of pleasure with some friends to relieve all the anxieties. Turns out its a cut price version of the bar from Dusk Til Dawn, minus Gringos and Salma Hayek. After a few days, his sister, Virginal Erika Eleniak (great casting), hires Dennis Miller (not famous in the UK) and decides to find out what happened and what is going on. Turns out Jerry Dandridge is now a priest and wants to get rid of all ill willers, but Lilith has other plans, but her heart needs to be cut in four, and it gets quite confusing. But to be fair, it's a pretty short film, and it's all good fun while it lasts. The cast, apart from Sarandon, are all pretty dire, even Feldman, and Miller, whoever he is just spouts out one liners every now and again, but I have this feeling he's a pretty big thing in the States, just like Alan Carr is here (exactley). If you like films that are easy on the eye, choc full of things for the lads, and never bothering the grey matter, you could do a lot worse than this. Otherwise, don't bother.

    "Bordello of Blood" does offer some undemanding B movie entertainment, even if it's never quite as much fun as one might like it to be. At least it never pretends to take itself very seriously, and star Dennis Miller, playing wise ass, low rent private eye Rafe Guttman, apparently concocted much of his sardonic dialogue himself. Rafe is hired by uptight Katherine Verdoux (Erika Eleniak) to locate her indolent brother Caleb (a well cast Corey Feldman), and tracks him to the mortuary, doubling as a bordello, where Caleb is last seen, tangling with evil boss vampire Lilith (Angie Everhart) and teaming up with slick televangelist J.C. Current (Chris Sarandon). While it's not really all that funny, the attempt by Miller and company to give their material that tongue in cheek flavour is still appreciated. Things get off to a fine start with The Crypt Keeper joined by a mummy, played by the ever dependable William Sadler, the hero of the first 'Tales from the Crypt' movie, "Demon Knight". The actors are all quite entertaining to watch. The casting of Sarandon is a decent in-joke seeing that he was the charming vampire-next-door in "Fright Night" and is one of the vampire slayers here. Feldman fans may be disappointed that he's only around for the first and final thirds, but he IS a hoot and makes the most of his brief screen time. Sexy Everheart clearly is relishing the role of the blood sucking babe; she, Eleniak, Kiara Hunter, Leslie Ann Phillips, and Juliet Reagh provide delectable eye candy. Supporting performances by Aubrey Morris (as McCutcheon) and Phil Fondacaro (as Vincent) are quite amusing. The gore effects are very entertaining and the soundtrack features some solid vintage and then-current rock tunes. Gilbert Adler, one of the producers of the TV series, made his feature film directing debut here, and does a decent job. Overall, the movie is a perfectly acceptable combination of sex, gore, and humour, and the pacing stays pretty consistent throughout. It's not as good as "Demon Knight", but it's not bad either. Be sure to watch out for the uncredited cameo appearance by Oscar winning actress Whoopi Goldberg. Seven out of 10.

    If you love horror movies like me, you'll love this flick. It is everything a real horror/ comedy buff can expect: 1. Cool jokes and gore galore; 2. Beautiful naked girls; 3. Creepy evildoers and sinister places; 4. Great heroes and Super villains; 5. A lot of profanity and cool deaths; 6. Nice old school special effects - and best of all : no CGI!!! and good acting throughout the movie :) 7. Sexy/ hot/ lustful blood-thirsty vampires. Don't expect: 1. The answer to deep (pseudo)philosophical questions, food for thought or fake /teen horror; 2. It is neither for the squeamish nor the highbrow; 3. Oscar award BS material; 4. Fake CGI blood; 5. Dream-like sequences BS; All in all, just for those who love horror! :)

    The Good News: Well, this was an unexpected surprise. I'm normally not the biggest fan of vampire movies, and this one is a lot of fun to watch. It's a goofy, entertaining film that doesn't really offer more than disposable viewing. The plot moves along at fast enough pace where something is always going on and it keeps the interest level very high. The film is also pretty gory, and it has a lot of blood spilled. Decapitations, staking, hearts ripped out, and bodies set on fire that it's just an over-the-top gore display. There's something here for every type of gore-fan, and nothing is left uncovered. It's a great film for gore-hounds. The "Tales from the Crypt" tag gives it a comedic tag, and for the most part, it's also very funny. The jokes fly nonstop, have a nice sharp turn to them, and actually get more than just a chuckle from them. It's a def mix of the two, and is even more remarkable in that it pulls it off so well. The action is also pretty fast and furious. The ending assault in the bordello is a great example, keeping it from being overly gruesome while also maintaining the sharp collection of explosions, guts and gore that the rest of the film has. Most important, though, is it's cheese appeal. It's not a very strong story, and more than a few moments are there just for a cheesy feel to them, and it makes the film that much better. http://matcao.com The Bad News: There really wasn't a while lot not to like about this one. It's basically just a fan-friendly film that features enough to entertain without requiring extensive over-analyzing. It's the type of film that will appeal to those who like it and will be criticized because of it. The Final Verdict: Sure, this is a cheesy B-movie, but it's chock full of what makes those kinds of films fun. It's violent, funny, and more, and is just supposed to be a fun time. Take it as that, and it becomes a much more fun time.

    Blood, breasts, vampires and Chris Sarandon. How can you go wrong? "Bordello of Blood," the second "Tales From The Crypt" feature film, supplies the viewer with ample amounts of all of the above, leaving room for little else. What it lacks in story, it more than makes up for in its cheap thrills, and as far as midnight guilty pleasures go, this one is about as good as it gets. The story revolves around a good-girl (Erika Eleniak) whose delinquent brother (Corey Feldman) goes missing. Upon hiring a wise-cracking private detective, it is revealed that a local morgue is housing a brothel run by a gang of beautiful but deadly vampires. Armed with super-soakers full of holy water and with the help of a guitar-slinging reverend (Chris Sarandon), the two set out to put the joint out of business once and for all. Dennis Miller is essentially playing himself, but keeps the humor pumping through the film's ridiculous premise. Chris Sarandon, likewise, is in top form as the genre hero he truly is. As mentioned before, there's plenty of bare-flesh and red-stuff to go around, and if that sort of thing is your bag, you'll have a blast with "Bordello of Blood." Take it for the cheap thrill ride it is.

    Tales From the Crypt should always be taken for what it is... entertainment in horror fashion by appealing to underage people with juvenile humor and absurd plots. And I down that spoonful every time. The running time flies by without hesitation that I have repeated viewings of this movie to see what I missed, and it has grown on me as if Angie Everheart's fangs have sunken themselves into my jugular. Angie's acting is horrendous as this is her feature debut but as long as her body talks who cares what is said. Dennis Miller provides his own variation to the know-it-all gumshoe, but could've faired better by losing the tight stonewashed jeans and slipped into some slacks.

    Tales From the Crypt should always be taken for what it is... entertainment in horror fashion by appealing to underage people with juvenile humor and absurd plots. And I down that spoonful every time. The running time flies by without hesitation that I have repeated viewings of this movie to see what I missed, and it has grown on me as if Angie Everheart's fangs have sunken themselves into my jugular. Angie's acting is horrendous as this is her feature debut but as long as her body talks who cares what is said. Dennis Miller provides his own variation to the know-it-all gumshoe, but could've faired better by losing the tight stonewashed jeans and slipped into some slacks. His humor goes beyond the average 16 year old that this film should've based its audience around, but he is trying to reach a higher level after all above this schlock. Erika Elenik as a televangelist producer... spot on in the absurdity! Corey Feldman and Chris Sarandon were apparently in on the joke for they just absorb the role and play it for the s**t and giggles as it is. Being a self-professed TFTC fanatic, I enjoyed the in-jokes that are within this movie (especially the key from Demon Knight) but the in-jokes were not essential as they are to other films (such as Kevin Smith flicks). This movie was never aimed to mentally impair you with horrific images, it was made for the fore-mentioned crowd and should be taken in that same vein... just make sure Angie Everheart is sucking from it

    I was surprised to notice that this flick has a low rating. Overall the movie wasn't bad at all. But you have to understand Tales From The Crypt. It is more black comedy than horror of course, starting with the crypt keeper. So many people out there find that guy annoying. He doesn't bore me, I was lucky to meet the crypt keeper in real life, John Kassir is his name, a really nice guy. Why is everybody on his back? The movie itself is never gory of course but it delivers a lot of blood and in this case a lot of nudity, if you have the full uncut version, here in Europe the movie is cut with 20 minutes. Just for the tits, weird. It's full of one liners just like the crypt keeper himself, when the master vampire, who works at a bordello, puts her tongue into a guys throat she goes search his heart with her tongue, of course he dies, and she said, men likes women who goes deep throat. Another example is cutting of the head of a guy by saying, I love men giving me head. and that's what most people hate about this movie, the one liners. I though it was a great movie, great effects and great performances, sad but true, when I visited LA I visited the church used in this film, never saw Lilith...

    The only problem with this movie is Dennis Miller. Well, then there is Corey Feldman, O.K. the only two problems with this movie are Dennis Miller and Corey Feldman. The actual story, y'know, the story the producers should have gone with, is the story of the TV preacher played by Chris Sarandon and his deal with Angie Everhart's Lilith. That's the story, that's where all the life is. Dennis Miller seems merely inserted into the action, like he got some points in his contract where he gets his own movie in exchange for services to be rendered later, so he is retrofitted into some script, in this case a Tales From The Crypt thing. It all comes off so forced and superfluous to the plot. That and Dennis Miller has no charisma, he's is an unpleasant little man devoid of life and vitality. But you do get to see some titties.

    Words cannot describe just how bad this thing is. The plot is nonsensical, the characters empty, the dialogue beyond moronic, the action boring, the scares non-existent, the humour completely absent. Add to that poor direction and some of the most confusing editing ever witnessed in cinema... This is an orgy of stupidity and bad taste. It boggles the mind how a project like this ever got greenlighted. Nothing in this film makes sense and apart from the stupidity one can't help but notice the nudity. I suppose the target audience for this were males between the ages of 12 and 16, with raging hormones, IQ below 70, and no sex life.

    The cryptkeeper (John Kassir) returns to tell the story of a funeral parlor that moonlights as a vampire bordello. Look at this amazing cast: Chris Sarandon, Corey Feldman, Dennis Miller, Angie Everhart, William Sadler and more... just wanted to point that out. Despite an overall bad film, this cast simply guarantees an enjoyable performance here and there. The film borrows somewhat from "Night Shift" (using a funeral home as a source of prostitution), and parallels "Dusk Till Dawn" with its use of loose women as vampires. I say parallels because the films came out the same year and I will just have to assume that any similarity in idea was purely coincidental. I do love that Feldman was quoted as saying Miller was a jerk on set. While I do not doubt this, Feldman himself has quite the reputation for being disrespectful to his fans. (I could share stories about his behavior at conventions, but that would be personal and beside the point.) Perhaps the most interesting thing about this film is that apparently Jewish Stars of David have no affect on vampires whereas crosses do. This suggests that the Jewish faith is false and Christianity is the true way. Maybe I am assuming too much, but I have always found that fascinating how vampire tales reinforce the Christian religion, despite vampires themselves not being a part of the Bible.

    Corey Feldman is still depressed about not being in a film with Corey Haim for a while, so decides to go to a house of pleasure with some friends to relieve all the anxieties. Turns out its a cut price version of the bar from Dusk Til Dawn, minus Gringos and Salma Hayek. After a few days, his sister, Virginal Erika Eleniak (great casting), hires Dennis Miller (not famous in the UK) and decides to find out what happened and what is going on. Turns out Jerry Dandridge is now a priest and wants to get rid of all ill willers, but Lilith has other plans, but her heart needs to be cut in four, and it gets quite confusing. But to be fair, it's a pretty short film, and it's all good fun while it lasts. The cast, apart from Sarandon, are all pretty dire, even Feldman, and Miller, whoever he is just spouts out one liners every now and again, but I have this feeling he's a pretty big thing in the States, just like Alan Carr is here (exactley). If you like films that are easy on the eye, choc full of things for the lads, and never bothering the grey matter, you could do a lot worse than this. Otherwise, don't bother.

    "Bordello of Blood" does offer some undemanding B movie entertainment, even if it's never quite as much fun as one might like it to be. At least it never pretends to take itself very seriously, and star Dennis Miller, playing wise ass, low rent private eye Rafe Guttman, apparently concocted much of his sardonic dialogue himself. Rafe is hired by uptight Katherine Verdoux (Erika Eleniak) to locate her indolent brother Caleb (a well cast Corey Feldman), and tracks him to the mortuary, doubling as a bordello, where Caleb is last seen, tangling with evil boss vampire Lilith (Angie Everhart) and teaming up with slick televangelist J.C. Current (Chris Sarandon). While it's not really all that funny, the attempt by Miller and company to give their material that tongue in cheek flavour is still appreciated. Things get off to a fine start with The Crypt Keeper joined by a mummy, played by the ever dependable William Sadler, the hero of the first 'Tales from the Crypt' movie, "Demon Knight". The actors are all quite entertaining to watch. The casting of Sarandon is a decent in-joke seeing that he was the charming vampire-next-door in "Fright Night" and is one of the vampire slayers here. Feldman fans may be disappointed that he's only around for the first and final thirds, but he IS a hoot and makes the most of his brief screen time. Sexy Everheart clearly is relishing the role of the blood sucking babe; she, Eleniak, Kiara Hunter, Leslie Ann Phillips, and Juliet Reagh provide delectable eye candy. Supporting performances by Aubrey Morris (as McCutcheon) and Phil Fondacaro (as Vincent) are quite amusing. The gore effects are very entertaining and the soundtrack features some solid vintage and then-current rock tunes. Gilbert Adler, one of the producers of the TV series, made his feature film directing debut here, and does a decent job. Overall, the movie is a perfectly acceptable combination of sex, gore, and humour, and the pacing stays pretty consistent throughout. It's not as good as "Demon Knight", but it's not bad either. Be sure to watch out for the uncredited cameo appearance by Oscar winning actress Whoopi Goldberg. Seven out of 10.

    If you love horror movies like me, you'll love this flick. It is everything a real horror/ comedy buff can expect: 1. Cool jokes and gore galore; 2. Beautiful naked girls; 3. Creepy evildoers and sinister places; 4. Great heroes and Super villains; 5. A lot of profanity and cool deaths; 6. Nice old school special effects - and best of all : no CGI!!! and good acting throughout the movie :) 7. Sexy/ hot/ lustful blood-thirsty vampires. Don't expect: 1. The answer to deep (pseudo)philosophical questions, food for thought or fake /teen horror; 2. It is neither for the squeamish nor the highbrow; 3. Oscar award BS material; 4. Fake CGI blood; 5. Dream-like sequences BS; All in all, just for those who love horror! :)

    The Good News: Well, this was an unexpected surprise. I'm normally not the biggest fan of vampire movies, and this one is a lot of fun to watch. It's a goofy, entertaining film that doesn't really offer more than disposable viewing. The plot moves along at fast enough pace where something is always going on and it keeps the interest level very high. The film is also pretty gory, and it has a lot of blood spilled. Decapitations, staking, hearts ripped out, and bodies set on fire that it's just an over-the-top gore display. There's something here for every type of gore-fan, and nothing is left uncovered. It's a great film for gore-hounds. The "Tales from the Crypt" tag gives it a comedic tag, and for the most part, it's also very funny. The jokes fly nonstop, have a nice sharp turn to them, and actually get more than just a chuckle from them. It's a def mix of the two, and is even more remarkable in that it pulls it off so well. The action is also pretty fast and furious. The ending assault in the bordello is a great example, keeping it from being overly gruesome while also maintaining the sharp collection of explosions, guts and gore that the rest of the film has. Most important, though, is it's cheese appeal. It's not a very strong story, and more than a few moments are there just for a cheesy feel to them, and it makes the film that much better. http://matcao.com The Bad News: There really wasn't a while lot not to like about this one. It's basically just a fan-friendly film that features enough to entertain without requiring extensive over-analyzing. It's the type of film that will appeal to those who like it and will be criticized because of it. The Final Verdict: Sure, this is a cheesy B-movie, but it's chock full of what makes those kinds of films fun. It's violent, funny, and more, and is just supposed to be a fun time. Take it as that, and it becomes a much more fun time.

    Blood, breasts, vampires and Chris Sarandon. How can you go wrong? "Bordello of Blood," the second "Tales From The Crypt" feature film, supplies the viewer with ample amounts of all of the above, leaving room for little else. What it lacks in story, it more than makes up for in its cheap thrills, and as far as midnight guilty pleasures go, this one is about as good as it gets. The story revolves around a good-girl (Erika Eleniak) whose delinquent brother (Corey Feldman) goes missing. Upon hiring a wise-cracking private detective, it is revealed that a local morgue is housing a brothel run by a gang of beautiful but deadly vampires. Armed with super-soakers full of holy water and with the help of a guitar-slinging reverend (Chris Sarandon), the two set out to put the joint out of business once and for all. Dennis Miller is essentially playing himself, but keeps the humor pumping through the film's ridiculous premise. Chris Sarandon, likewise, is in top form as the genre hero he truly is. As mentioned before, there's plenty of bare-flesh and red-stuff to go around, and if that sort of thing is your bag, you'll have a blast with "Bordello of Blood." Take it for the cheap thrill ride it is.
