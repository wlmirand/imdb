    I have not seen a lot of westerns so I don't pretend to be some expert on western movies. However this is without a doubt one of the best westerns of all-time and my favorite western of all-time. I know some people criticize this film for not being historically accurate or a shallow attempt to be a "hip" western. Well, the truth is this film is not 100% accurate with history but what movie is? I liked the idea of this being a hip western staring Hollywood's "brat pack" with rock music playing in the background. I think it fits because this is basically a story about Billy the kid, a outlaw who was under 20 years old so it makes sense to give this one a younger or hipper feel to it. I like the Billy the kid story and I've seen many movies about him but this is the best one for 3 reasons. 1: I liked that they started from the beginning, other films focus on the "later" years when he met Pat Garret. 2: I like that this is more about the gang and not just about Billy. 3: Emilio Estevez is the best Billy the kid. I think the story is very well done, it's the best depiction of the Lincoln county war in New Mexico and the changes made were for the better. Like in real life John Tunstall was only twenty something and their were about a dozen or so "regulaters" not just the 6 shown here but the changes made worked for the better. The film is well directed by Chris Cain with a great balance of action, humor and is appropriately violent. I also like the look of the film, it really makes you feel like their in the wild west during 1878 and not on some sound stage. It also has a great cast! With the great Terrance Stamp who's perfectly cast as John Tunstall, an older English man who takes in six young rebellious men to work at his cattle ranch. The villain is the always great Jack Palance as Murphy, who kills Tunstal, starting the war. The 6 young boys search for justice so they become sheriffs but thanks to Billy killing everyone who they're supposed to arrest, they become outlaws. I LOVE Emillio Estevez as Billy the Kid. I know many would say his interpretation is not historically accurate but I think it's much more the way we would like to imagine the kid. Emillio gives one of his best performances and he was cheated out of an Oscar nomination. I think they did a great job in blending a lot of color to the kid. Billy is a lot of things in this movie, he's cocky, rebellious, trigger-happy, a little crazy, a loyal friend, and charming. Billy is perfectly portrayed as an anti-hero like he should be. Emillio always makes him likable even if we know he's a little crazy. I do like how they make Billy a little crazy as he takes pleasure in killing his enemies. His kills are marked by his unforgettable giggle, I love Emillio's lunatic sounding laugh. Billy is fearless who enjoys the thrill of life or death situations. But despite his wild behavior he's extremely loyal to his friends which gives him a lot of heart. Kiefer Sutherland is great as the more sensitive "Doc", one of my favorite performances of his. I love Lou Diamond Phillips as Chavez Y Chavez, possibly his best role and I love his knife skills. Dermot Mulloney is great as "dirty" Steve and he has a lot of funny moments. Casey Siemasko is great as Charlie, the more scared one of the bunch. I love Charlie Sheen as Dick, the appointed leader of the gang. I like how he fought for leadership of the regulators with his real life brother Emillio as Billy. I like the name of the gang as "the regulators", that's a cool name. The film has non stop action, good humor, good characters and the theme of friendship works well here.I love the rock'n'roll theme music. I like that they show Emillio/Billy take the now famous Billy the kid picture as well. One of my favorite movies of all-time.

    At the end of the movie, Billy and his gang are holed up in the house of their lawyer which is completely surrounded by hundreds of lawmen, bounty hunters, and the U.S Army. Even Doc says "Billy we're good, but this is getting ridiculous.". After the house is set on fire, Chavez escapes and somehow sneaks right past the men outside. Billy and his gang exit the house guns a blazin' right in front of a Gatling gun the Army has brought which mysteriously is not used. Chavez rides back with 3 horses, rides right through the men outside, jumps the horses over a barricade, and Billy and Doc somehow manage to mount the horses and ride right through the men down the street with not one shot fired. Then to top it all off, the lawyer emerges from the house and the Army pumps about 100 bullets into him with the same Gatling gun that for some reason they didn't use on Billy and his gang. It gets better, Billy then rides back, stops in the middle of the street, pops a cap into Murphy, and then rides off with no shots fired at him. Of course the gang then just rides off into the sunset, why would the US Army bother to pursue? This was a ridiculous, unbelievable ending and completely ruined the entire movie.

    I will firstly admit that I did not pay the fullest attention to this film while it was on, but I did understand everything going on, and I knew it was going to bit of an average film anyway, but still one I was interested in because of the all-star cast, from director Christopher Cain (The Next Karate Kid). Basically, set in 1878 in New Mexico, young gun men are picked up on the road by John Tunstall (Terence Stamp) to work on his ranch, but they also learn to read and be civilised, but competitive cattle seller and rich rancher Lawrence G. Murphy (Jack Palance) is hanging around and acting suspiciously. Tunstall is shot by Murphy's men during a scuffle, because Sheriff Brady (Daniel 'Danny' Kamin) is one of the gang Justice Wilson (Victor Izay) can't do anything about the situation, but attorney Alex McSween (Lost's Terry O'Quinn) persuades him to recruit the young men as deputies and give them the warrants to arrest the murderers. The young men: William H. Bonney (Emilio Estevez), who later becomes the infamous 'Billy the Kid', Josiah Gordon 'Doc' Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland), 'Jose' Chavez y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips), Richard 'Dick' Brewer (Charlie Sheen), Dirty Steve Stephens (Dermot Mulroney) and Charles 'Charley' Bowdre (Casey Siemaszko), do not intend to arrest the killers though, they just want to shoot them. After Dick and one of the others is killed the five remaining young gun men have the final showdown with Murphy and his gang, and Billy of course went on to become an outlaw and was eventually shot dead by Patrick Floyd 'Pat' Garrett (Patrick Wayne). Also starring Sharon Thomas Cain as Susan McSween, Brian Keith as Buckshot Roberts and Cody Palance, Jack's son as Baker. The cast all do their parts fine, especially Esteves in the leading role of the well known gunslinger, I may not have followed the story in full, but the action sequences are good to watch with all the guns firing and some blood, a not bad western. Worth watching!

    Young Guns is directed by Christopher Cain and written by John Fusco. It stars Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney, Casey Siemaszko, Terry O'Quinn, Jack Palance and Terence Stamp. Music is by Brian Banks and Anthony Marinelli and cinematography is by Dean Semler. Film is a telling of Billy the Kid's part in the Lincoln County War in New Mexico 1878. Plot sees the murder of John Tunstall send Billy and the rest of the Tunstall Regulators on a mission to avenge his murder. It ain't easy having pals. Often derided by Western movie purists as a sort of MTV Western made to showcase the various talents of the then Hollywood Brat Pack of Estevez, Sheen, Sutherland et al, Young Guns is actually a far more entertaining picture than some critical assessments suggest it is. It also has some rock solid Western history footings holding it up, yes it's far from accurate in various scenarios, age of characters and numbers in gangs etc, but the core story of the Lincoln County War is there. A massive success at the box office and spawning an equally successful sequel in 1990, Young Guns zips along at pace, contains high energy action sequences and provides plenty of quotable dialogue. Best of all, though, it doesn't take itself seriously, it wants to be a rooting-tooting Western of fun endeavours, if viewed on those terms it's an absolute winner, especially since the cast are playing it that way. Alex, if you stay they're gonna kill you. And then I'm gonna have to go around and kill all the guys who killed you. That's a lot of killing. Estevez is terrific as The Kid, blending boyish arrogance with fearless rage, a fun and scary character who is easy to get on the saddle with. Elsewhere it's a mixed bag, but apart from the disappointing Sheen, the casting decisions sit well and if you talk to ten different Young Guns fans you will most likely get a number of different answers come back as to who is their favourite Regulator (mine is Dirty Steve played by Mulroney if you are wondering?). O'Quinn is spot on as Alex McSween, Stamp adds classical tones to the ill fated John Tunstall and Palance is a neat fit as villain Lawrence Murphy. Nice to see Brian Keith get a cameo as a larger than life bounty hunter as well. Semler's photography and Cain's filming techniques are a bit too anachronistic at times and the Banks/Marinelli score too modern an accompaniment on occasions. But film rounds out as a nifty bit of Oater play for Gen X and showed that as the 1990s approached there was still love for this greatest of genres. 7.5/10

    Really good story on the rise of Billy the Kid and his fellow cohorts. The historical accuracy of the movie probably isn't perfect but if you're not looking for a history channel version of his story then the story is perfectly fine and still hits on a lot of the major points in Billy the Kid and his problems with the Murphy gang. The cast consists of a who's who of young actors in the late '80s with Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips. If you're looking for a fun western then this is a movie for you. Good shootout scenes and Estevez plays the role of his career as Billy. Much better done then any other movie about Billy's life.

    and the result was this abomination of a movie and butchering of history. Anyone who doesn't think this movie is drek should watch a real western, "The Unforgiven" or "Tombstone" or even "The Searchers" with John Wayne. This movie is just Charlie and Emilio and their buddies getting paid to ride horses, wear cool clothes, and play with guns. Avoid it like the plague, along with the sequel (why???) and their other terrible outing, "The Three Musketeers" otherwise known as; the Brat Pack wanted to wear more cool costumes, play with swords and get paid for it. They're even less believable as Musketeers than they are as gunfighters.

    For images and story. For music and subtle details of a interior war. For the science to make nuances in perfect place. For Martijn Lakemeier play and for the end - crush of spell. In fact, for the art to describe a war as mixture of trust, friendship, courage and measure of truth in the eyes of a boy. Limits and force of gestures. Hope and power of small pieces of day. Sacrifice as way to be and snow like cell of shadows. And love - sketch of real values. It is difficult to say more. May be movie of a self definition or only fragment by a historical event. Few hours of a hero or circle of resistance. For every person - a slice. From a poem.

    This movie is watchable. The best performing actor by a mile is Jack Palance, making much out of a shallow character. From the younger bunch (Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Casey Siemaszko, Dermut Mulroney and Emilio Estevez) only the last one is worth mentioning as rather decent. The plot is predictable all the way even if you are not very familiar with Billy the Kid. Talking history, don't expect to pick up anything from history. Movies are not the best place to learn history and this one doesn't make an exception. The soundtrack is not very exciting either. So what make it watchable ? The settings are really quality. In every scene you can feel a bit of that dust and the desert-like weather. And the action. If you take some of your precious time to spend on "Young Guns", you are not looking for some mind-boggling drama, are you ? There are many sequences of shooting, bloodshed, revenge and quarry. That's the best of it. If you consider yourself thin-skinned, don't even bother to watch. Apart from some nonsensical dialogs, a dislocated speech here and there to give you some "history", it boils down to guns going off. And it won't let you down in this very aspect. The accents are another annoyance. But what disappoints immensely is Charlie Sheen, whose awfulness kills his character into the first 30 minutes. It is a blessing. And his movie career didn't actually take off. Go figure ! 5 out of 10

    It seems that the 80's were so flooded by the "Star Wars" and "Rocky" films, by Steven Spielberg's "Indiana Jones" and so many other blockbusters such as "Top Gun" or "Terminator" that it didn't leave much room for some little gems like "Biloxi Blues" or "Barfly" or let's say for the Western genre, "Young Guns"  one of my favorite westerns ever. Maybe, I'm using 'one of' as an understatement, as if I was ashamed to say 'm favorite', but I am not, I just gained some maturity, I saw more westerns since the day I discovered "Young Guns", and I can understand why this movie didn't get much acclaim, especially if you consider the period, the 80's, when Eastwood the director was reconquering the genre, and through "Pale Rider" prepared the audience to a darker form of revisionist westerns. "Young Guns" with its youthful cast introduced by one my all-time favorite intros: Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Casey Siemaczko and Dermot Mulroney, looks closer to the typical 80's film marketed for teenage audiences than a mature film meant to be taken seriously, on the surface only  because if you watch it, and decide to appreciate the film regardless of your personal tastes  well, I defy anyone not to be captivated by theses 100 minutes of pure entertainment. Yes, even the dark "Pale Rider" pales in comparison with "Young Guns", because the latter doesn't overdo the archetypes of the genre, it has its load of thrills, of chases, shootouts, parties, romances, discussions BUT with something more that lacks even in the most acclaimed masterpieces of the genre : it has characters, a wonderful gallery of characters, who carry their personalities less than stereotypes than true human flows, with their motives, actions and reactions, and within the plot of the film, there are different arcs involving each of these characters, handled with such a confidence, that nothing ever feels forced or clich&eacute;, and at the end, each of them would ultimately change, making "Young Guns" more than a Western but also a sort of coming-of-age story, a genre cherished during the 80's. And of course, the biggest change will concern the leader of the bunch who'll become one of the most defining legends of the Old West. As a kid, I grew up reading "The Adventures of Lucky Luke", a Franco-Belgian comic book set in the Old West, needless to say that I loved it so much, I was familiar with Billy the Kid, the stagecoaches, Jesse James, Calamity Jane, the Conquest of the West before I reached my tenth year, so I discovered "Young Guns" at the age of 13, with enough knowledge of the Old West to appreciate it and not enough of cinematic westerns to judge it impartially. And I'll never forget that night, when I saw it with my father, I didn't care much about the story until that young blondish guy introduced himself by "William Bonney" and the other said "Pat Garrett", I told my dad, "hey, it's Billy the Kid, and this is the guy who'll kill him" The movie took a whole new direction for me and it immediately grabbed my interest. And the rest didn't disappoint me. "Young Guns" is a movie whose rooting process is slow but efficient, you definitely get into the story when the tutor, John Tunstall, remarkably played by Terrence Stamp, is killed by men who belongs to the cattle owner and biggest competitor, the evil Murphy, Jack Palance whose evil smirk hasn't lost its touch either. Then, the 'young guns' are mandated as 'regulators' to arrest the killers, then it all gets wrong when Billy, the previously underestimated newcomer makes this business personal. He makes himself an enemy through Dick, Charlie Sheen, the straight man of the bunch, who'll get killed as if fate wanted another kind of leader, and progressively, as blood is shed and guns are fired, we get into the others, Doc, Kiefer Sutherland as the poet in love with a little Chinese girl sold to Murphy for a dirty shirt, Chavez, Philips as the only surviving of a Navajo tribe killed by Murphy's men with the army as accomplice, and of course, his 'friend', the scene-stealing tobacco-chewing "Dirty" Steve. But the one who touched my heart the most was Simeaczko as Charley Bowder, the nicest and most friendly (also cowardly) of the bunch. It was a nice touch for the story to have a character who doesn't react as a coldblooded killer but feels sick from the simple thought that he might be hanged, and his evolution is also one of the most rewarding aspects of the film, as I never fail to have goose bumps in the scene where he finally overcomes his fear and start getting into the shootout that concludes the film. And talking of the shootout, it's certainly one of my all-time favorite climactic sequences because I never saw the way it started coming and the amount of thrills is so great that at the end, me and my Dad, sorry, my Dad and me  could only wow, and I knew I had just watched one of the greatest films ever. Yes, "Young Guns" became one of my all-time favorite films because of so many things, the extraordinary performance of Emilio Estevez, the difference between the characters and my rooting for each of them, the amazing shootout, the coming-of-age story and beyond everything, the emotional core of the film: a great message about solidarity and friendship, as mentioned by the concluding line of the film : "Pals", before followed by one hell of an amazing soundtrack. So say what you want, it may not be the best Western ever made, it didn't get any Oscar nominations, but for some reason, it will forever have a special place in my heart.

    Young Guns tells the story of 'Billy the Kid' one more time, and after seeing so many versions of the same story, you can not help comparing, but with good results. Emilio Estevez is very good as Billy, and also Kiefer Sutherland and Charlie Sheen as his friends.Young Guns suffers from the fact that the action scenes are kind of confusing, because of the camera work that tries to be original. You see a lot of close ups where long distance views would be more clarifying. There is a good scene where they shoot at Buckshot Roberts, and also great moments when Billy shows a sense of humor. The relationships in the group, at the beginning when Charlie Sheen is the leader and how Estevez begins to take his place are also well presented. The Irish Jack Palance fighting the English Terence Stamp makes a good point of how they brought their troubles home to the west. Basically this film is a celebration of the young promising actors, playing with guns.It makes you think of an 'Ocean's Eleven' of the West.

    I will firstly admit that I did not pay the fullest attention to this film while it was on, but I did understand everything going on, and I knew it was going to bit of an average film anyway, but still one I was interested in because of the all-star cast, from director Christopher Cain (The Next Karate Kid). Basically, set in 1878 in New Mexico, young gun men are picked up on the road by John Tunstall (Terence Stamp) to work on his ranch, but they also learn to read and be civilised, but competitive cattle seller and rich rancher Lawrence G. Murphy (Jack Palance) is hanging around and acting suspiciously. Tunstall is shot by Murphy's men during a scuffle, because Sheriff Brady (Daniel 'Danny' Kamin) is one of the gang Justice Wilson (Victor Izay) can't do anything about the situation, but attorney Alex McSween (Lost's Terry O'Quinn) persuades him to recruit the young men as deputies and give them the warrants to arrest the murderers. The young men: William H. Bonney (Emilio Estevez), who later becomes the infamous 'Billy the Kid', Josiah Gordon 'Doc' Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland), 'Jose' Chavez y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips), Richard 'Dick' Brewer (Charlie Sheen), Dirty Steve Stephens (Dermot Mulroney) and Charles 'Charley' Bowdre (Casey Siemaszko), do not intend to arrest the killers though, they just want to shoot them. After Dick and one of the others is killed the five remaining young gun men have the final showdown with Murphy and his gang, and Billy of course went on to become an outlaw and was eventually shot dead by Patrick Floyd 'Pat' Garrett (Patrick Wayne). Also starring Sharon Thomas Cain as Susan McSween, Brian Keith as Buckshot Roberts and Cody Palance, Jack's son as Baker. The cast all do their parts fine, especially Esteves in the leading role of the well known gunslinger, I may not have followed the story in full, but the action sequences are good to watch with all the guns firing and some blood, a not bad western. Worth watching!

    Young Guns is directed by Christopher Cain and written by John Fusco. It stars Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney, Casey Siemaszko, Terry O'Quinn, Jack Palance and Terence Stamp. Music is by Brian Banks and Anthony Marinelli and cinematography is by Dean Semler. Film is a telling of Billy the Kid's part in the Lincoln County War in New Mexico 1878. Plot sees the murder of John Tunstall send Billy and the rest of the Tunstall Regulators on a mission to avenge his murder. It ain't easy having pals. Often derided by Western movie purists as a sort of MTV Western made to showcase the various talents of the then Hollywood Brat Pack of Estevez, Sheen, Sutherland et al, Young Guns is actually a far more entertaining picture than some critical assessments suggest it is. It also has some rock solid Western history footings holding it up, yes it's far from accurate in various scenarios, age of characters and numbers in gangs etc, but the core story of the Lincoln County War is there. A massive success at the box office and spawning an equally successful sequel in 1990, Young Guns zips along at pace, contains high energy action sequences and provides plenty of quotable dialogue. Best of all, though, it doesn't take itself seriously, it wants to be a rooting-tooting Western of fun endeavours, if viewed on those terms it's an absolute winner, especially since the cast are playing it that way. Alex, if you stay they're gonna kill you. And then I'm gonna have to go around and kill all the guys who killed you. That's a lot of killing. Estevez is terrific as The Kid, blending boyish arrogance with fearless rage, a fun and scary character who is easy to get on the saddle with. Elsewhere it's a mixed bag, but apart from the disappointing Sheen, the casting decisions sit well and if you talk to ten different Young Guns fans you will most likely get a number of different answers come back as to who is their favourite Regulator (mine is Dirty Steve played by Mulroney if you are wondering?). O'Quinn is spot on as Alex McSween, Stamp adds classical tones to the ill fated John Tunstall and Palance is a neat fit as villain Lawrence Murphy. Nice to see Brian Keith get a cameo as a larger than life bounty hunter as well. Semler's photography and Cain's filming techniques are a bit too anachronistic at times and the Banks/Marinelli score too modern an accompaniment on occasions. But film rounds out as a nifty bit of Oater play for Gen X and showed that as the 1990s approached there was still love for this greatest of genres. 7.5/10

    Really good story on the rise of Billy the Kid and his fellow cohorts. The historical accuracy of the movie probably isn't perfect but if you're not looking for a history channel version of his story then the story is perfectly fine and still hits on a lot of the major points in Billy the Kid and his problems with the Murphy gang. The cast consists of a who's who of young actors in the late '80s with Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips. If you're looking for a fun western then this is a movie for you. Good shootout scenes and Estevez plays the role of his career as Billy. Much better done then any other movie about Billy's life.

    and the result was this abomination of a movie and butchering of history. Anyone who doesn't think this movie is drek should watch a real western, "The Unforgiven" or "Tombstone" or even "The Searchers" with John Wayne. This movie is just Charlie and Emilio and their buddies getting paid to ride horses, wear cool clothes, and play with guns. Avoid it like the plague, along with the sequel (why???) and their other terrible outing, "The Three Musketeers" otherwise known as; the Brat Pack wanted to wear more cool costumes, play with swords and get paid for it. They're even less believable as Musketeers than they are as gunfighters.

    This movie is watchable. The best performing actor by a mile is Jack Palance, making much out of a shallow character. From the younger bunch (Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Casey Siemaszko, Dermut Mulroney and Emilio Estevez) only the last one is worth mentioning as rather decent. The plot is predictable all the way even if you are not very familiar with Billy the Kid. Talking history, don't expect to pick up anything from history. Movies are not the best place to learn history and this one doesn't make an exception. The soundtrack is not very exciting either. So what make it watchable ? The settings are really quality. In every scene you can feel a bit of that dust and the desert-like weather. And the action. If you take some of your precious time to spend on "Young Guns", you are not looking for some mind-boggling drama, are you ? There are many sequences of shooting, bloodshed, revenge and quarry. That's the best of it. If you consider yourself thin-skinned, don't even bother to watch. Apart from some nonsensical dialogs, a dislocated speech here and there to give you some "history", it boils down to guns going off. And it won't let you down in this very aspect. The accents are another annoyance. But what disappoints immensely is Charlie Sheen, whose awfulness kills his character into the first 30 minutes. It is a blessing. And his movie career didn't actually take off. Go figure ! 5 out of 10

    It seems that the 80's were so flooded by the "Star Wars" and "Rocky" films, by Steven Spielberg's "Indiana Jones" and so many other blockbusters such as "Top Gun" or "Terminator" that it didn't leave much room for some little gems like "Biloxi Blues" or "Barfly" or let's say for the Western genre, "Young Guns"  one of my favorite westerns ever. Maybe, I'm using 'one of' as an understatement, as if I was ashamed to say 'm favorite', but I am not, I just gained some maturity, I saw more westerns since the day I discovered "Young Guns", and I can understand why this movie didn't get much acclaim, especially if you consider the period, the 80's, when Eastwood the director was reconquering the genre, and through "Pale Rider" prepared the audience to a darker form of revisionist westerns. "Young Guns" with its youthful cast introduced by one my all-time favorite intros: Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Casey Siemaczko and Dermot Mulroney, looks closer to the typical 80's film marketed for teenage audiences than a mature film meant to be taken seriously, on the surface only  because if you watch it, and decide to appreciate the film regardless of your personal tastes  well, I defy anyone not to be captivated by theses 100 minutes of pure entertainment. Yes, even the dark "Pale Rider" pales in comparison with "Young Guns", because the latter doesn't overdo the archetypes of the genre, it has its load of thrills, of chases, shootouts, parties, romances, discussions BUT with something more that lacks even in the most acclaimed masterpieces of the genre : it has characters, a wonderful gallery of characters, who carry their personalities less than stereotypes than true human flows, with their motives, actions and reactions, and within the plot of the film, there are different arcs involving each of these characters, handled with such a confidence, that nothing ever feels forced or clich&eacute;, and at the end, each of them would ultimately change, making "Young Guns" more than a Western but also a sort of coming-of-age story, a genre cherished during the 80's. And of course, the biggest change will concern the leader of the bunch who'll become one of the most defining legends of the Old West. As a kid, I grew up reading "The Adventures of Lucky Luke", a Franco-Belgian comic book set in the Old West, needless to say that I loved it so much, I was familiar with Billy the Kid, the stagecoaches, Jesse James, Calamity Jane, the Conquest of the West before I reached my tenth year, so I discovered "Young Guns" at the age of 13, with enough knowledge of the Old West to appreciate it and not enough of cinematic westerns to judge it impartially. And I'll never forget that night, when I saw it with my father, I didn't care much about the story until that young blondish guy introduced himself by "William Bonney" and the other said "Pat Garrett", I told my dad, "hey, it's Billy the Kid, and this is the guy who'll kill him" The movie took a whole new direction for me and it immediately grabbed my interest. And the rest didn't disappoint me. "Young Guns" is a movie whose rooting process is slow but efficient, you definitely get into the story when the tutor, John Tunstall, remarkably played by Terrence Stamp, is killed by men who belongs to the cattle owner and biggest competitor, the evil Murphy, Jack Palance whose evil smirk hasn't lost its touch either. Then, the 'young guns' are mandated as 'regulators' to arrest the killers, then it all gets wrong when Billy, the previously underestimated newcomer makes this business personal. He makes himself an enemy through Dick, Charlie Sheen, the straight man of the bunch, who'll get killed as if fate wanted another kind of leader, and progressively, as blood is shed and guns are fired, we get into the others, Doc, Kiefer Sutherland as the poet in love with a little Chinese girl sold to Murphy for a dirty shirt, Chavez, Philips as the only surviving of a Navajo tribe killed by Murphy's men with the army as accomplice, and of course, his 'friend', the scene-stealing tobacco-chewing "Dirty" Steve. But the one who touched my heart the most was Simeaczko as Charley Bowder, the nicest and most friendly (also cowardly) of the bunch. It was a nice touch for the story to have a character who doesn't react as a coldblooded killer but feels sick from the simple thought that he might be hanged, and his evolution is also one of the most rewarding aspects of the film, as I never fail to have goose bumps in the scene where he finally overcomes his fear and start getting into the shootout that concludes the film. And talking of the shootout, it's certainly one of my all-time favorite climactic sequences because I never saw the way it started coming and the amount of thrills is so great that at the end, me and my Dad, sorry, my Dad and me  could only wow, and I knew I had just watched one of the greatest films ever. Yes, "Young Guns" became one of my all-time favorite films because of so many things, the extraordinary performance of Emilio Estevez, the difference between the characters and my rooting for each of them, the amazing shootout, the coming-of-age story and beyond everything, the emotional core of the film: a great message about solidarity and friendship, as mentioned by the concluding line of the film : "Pals", before followed by one hell of an amazing soundtrack. So say what you want, it may not be the best Western ever made, it didn't get any Oscar nominations, but for some reason, it will forever have a special place in my heart.

    Young Guns tells the story of 'Billy the Kid' one more time, and after seeing so many versions of the same story, you can not help comparing, but with good results. Emilio Estevez is very good as Billy, and also Kiefer Sutherland and Charlie Sheen as his friends.Young Guns suffers from the fact that the action scenes are kind of confusing, because of the camera work that tries to be original. You see a lot of close ups where long distance views would be more clarifying. There is a good scene where they shoot at Buckshot Roberts, and also great moments when Billy shows a sense of humor. The relationships in the group, at the beginning when Charlie Sheen is the leader and how Estevez begins to take his place are also well presented. The Irish Jack Palance fighting the English Terence Stamp makes a good point of how they brought their troubles home to the west. Basically this film is a celebration of the young promising actors, playing with guns.It makes you think of an 'Ocean's Eleven' of the West.

    I have not seen a lot of westerns so I don't pretend to be some expert on western movies. However this is without a doubt one of the best westerns of all-time and my favorite western of all-time. I know some people criticize this film for not being historically accurate or a shallow attempt to be a "hip" western. Well, the truth is this film is not 100% accurate with history but what movie is? I liked the idea of this being a hip western staring Hollywood's "brat pack" with rock music playing in the background. I think it fits because this is basically a story about Billy the kid, a outlaw who was under 20 years old so it makes sense to give this one a younger or hipper feel to it. I like the Billy the kid story and I've seen many movies about him but this is the best one for 3 reasons. 1: I liked that they started from the beginning, other films focus on the "later" years when he met Pat Garret. 2: I like that this is more about the gang and not just about Billy. 3: Emilio Estevez is the best Billy the kid. I think the story is very well done, it's the best depiction of the Lincoln county war in New Mexico and the changes made were for the better. Like in real life John Tunstall was only twenty something and their were about a dozen or so "regulaters" not just the 6 shown here but the changes made worked for the better. The film is well directed by Chris Cain with a great balance of action, humor and is appropriately violent. I also like the look of the film, it really makes you feel like their in the wild west during 1878 and not on some sound stage. It also has a great cast! With the great Terrance Stamp who's perfectly cast as John Tunstall, an older English man who takes in six young rebellious men to work at his cattle ranch. The villain is the always great Jack Palance as Murphy, who kills Tunstal, starting the war. The 6 young boys search for justice so they become sheriffs but thanks to Billy killing everyone who they're supposed to arrest, they become outlaws. I LOVE Emillio Estevez as Billy the Kid. I know many would say his interpretation is not historically accurate but I think it's much more the way we would like to imagine the kid. Emillio gives one of his best performances and he was cheated out of an Oscar nomination. I think they did a great job in blending a lot of color to the kid. Billy is a lot of things in this movie, he's cocky, rebellious, trigger-happy, a little crazy, a loyal friend, and charming. Billy is perfectly portrayed as an anti-hero like he should be. Emillio always makes him likable even if we know he's a little crazy. I do like how they make Billy a little crazy as he takes pleasure in killing his enemies. His kills are marked by his unforgettable giggle, I love Emillio's lunatic sounding laugh. Billy is fearless who enjoys the thrill of life or death situations. But despite his wild behavior he's extremely loyal to his friends which gives him a lot of heart. Kiefer Sutherland is great as the more sensitive "Doc", one of my favorite performances of his. I love Lou Diamond Phillips as Chavez Y Chavez, possibly his best role and I love his knife skills. Dermot Mulloney is great as "dirty" Steve and he has a lot of funny moments. Casey Siemasko is great as Charlie, the more scared one of the bunch. I love Charlie Sheen as Dick, the appointed leader of the gang. I like how he fought for leadership of the regulators with his real life brother Emillio as Billy. I like the name of the gang as "the regulators", that's a cool name. The film has non stop action, good humor, good characters and the theme of friendship works well here.I love the rock'n'roll theme music. I like that they show Emillio/Billy take the now famous Billy the kid picture as well. One of my favorite movies of all-time.

    At the end of the movie, Billy and his gang are holed up in the house of their lawyer which is completely surrounded by hundreds of lawmen, bounty hunters, and the U.S Army. Even Doc says "Billy we're good, but this is getting ridiculous.". After the house is set on fire, Chavez escapes and somehow sneaks right past the men outside. Billy and his gang exit the house guns a blazin' right in front of a Gatling gun the Army has brought which mysteriously is not used. Chavez rides back with 3 horses, rides right through the men outside, jumps the horses over a barricade, and Billy and Doc somehow manage to mount the horses and ride right through the men down the street with not one shot fired. Then to top it all off, the lawyer emerges from the house and the Army pumps about 100 bullets into him with the same Gatling gun that for some reason they didn't use on Billy and his gang. It gets better, Billy then rides back, stops in the middle of the street, pops a cap into Murphy, and then rides off with no shots fired at him. Of course the gang then just rides off into the sunset, why would the US Army bother to pursue? This was a ridiculous, unbelievable ending and completely ruined the entire movie.

    I will firstly admit that I did not pay the fullest attention to this film while it was on, but I did understand everything going on, and I knew it was going to bit of an average film anyway, but still one I was interested in because of the all-star cast, from director Christopher Cain (The Next Karate Kid). Basically, set in 1878 in New Mexico, young gun men are picked up on the road by John Tunstall (Terence Stamp) to work on his ranch, but they also learn to read and be civilised, but competitive cattle seller and rich rancher Lawrence G. Murphy (Jack Palance) is hanging around and acting suspiciously. Tunstall is shot by Murphy's men during a scuffle, because Sheriff Brady (Daniel 'Danny' Kamin) is one of the gang Justice Wilson (Victor Izay) can't do anything about the situation, but attorney Alex McSween (Lost's Terry O'Quinn) persuades him to recruit the young men as deputies and give them the warrants to arrest the murderers. The young men: William H. Bonney (Emilio Estevez), who later becomes the infamous 'Billy the Kid', Josiah Gordon 'Doc' Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland), 'Jose' Chavez y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips), Richard 'Dick' Brewer (Charlie Sheen), Dirty Steve Stephens (Dermot Mulroney) and Charles 'Charley' Bowdre (Casey Siemaszko), do not intend to arrest the killers though, they just want to shoot them. After Dick and one of the others is killed the five remaining young gun men have the final showdown with Murphy and his gang, and Billy of course went on to become an outlaw and was eventually shot dead by Patrick Floyd 'Pat' Garrett (Patrick Wayne). Also starring Sharon Thomas Cain as Susan McSween, Brian Keith as Buckshot Roberts and Cody Palance, Jack's son as Baker. The cast all do their parts fine, especially Esteves in the leading role of the well known gunslinger, I may not have followed the story in full, but the action sequences are good to watch with all the guns firing and some blood, a not bad western. Worth watching!

    It seems that the 80's were so flooded by the "Star Wars" and "Rocky" films, by Steven Spielberg's "Indiana Jones" and so many other blockbusters such as "Top Gun" or "Terminator" that it didn't leave much room for some little gems like "Biloxi Blues" or "Barfly" or let's say for the Western genre, "Young Guns"  one of my favorite westerns ever. Maybe, I'm using 'one of' as an understatement, as if I was ashamed to say 'm favorite', but I am not, I just gained some maturity, I saw more westerns since the day I discovered "Young Guns", and I can understand why this movie didn't get much acclaim, especially if you consider the period, the 80's, when Eastwood the director was reconquering the genre, and through "Pale Rider" prepared the audience to a darker form of revisionist westerns. "Young Guns" with its youthful cast introduced by one my all-time favorite intros: Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Casey Siemaczko and Dermot Mulroney, looks closer to the typical 80's film marketed for teenage audiences than a mature film meant to be taken seriously, on the surface only  because if you watch it, and decide to appreciate the film regardless of your personal tastes  well, I defy anyone not to be captivated by theses 100 minutes of pure entertainment. Yes, even the dark "Pale Rider" pales in comparison with "Young Guns", because the latter doesn't overdo the archetypes of the genre, it has its load of thrills, of chases, shootouts, parties, romances, discussions BUT with something more that lacks even in the most acclaimed masterpieces of the genre : it has characters, a wonderful gallery of characters, who carry their personalities less than stereotypes than true human flows, with their motives, actions and reactions, and within the plot of the film, there are different arcs involving each of these characters, handled with such a confidence, that nothing ever feels forced or clich&eacute;, and at the end, each of them would ultimately change, making "Young Guns" more than a Western but also a sort of coming-of-age story, a genre cherished during the 80's. And of course, the biggest change will concern the leader of the bunch who'll become one of the most defining legends of the Old West. As a kid, I grew up reading "The Adventures of Lucky Luke", a Franco-Belgian comic book set in the Old West, needless to say that I loved it so much, I was familiar with Billy the Kid, the stagecoaches, Jesse James, Calamity Jane, the Conquest of the West before I reached my tenth year, so I discovered "Young Guns" at the age of 13, with enough knowledge of the Old West to appreciate it and not enough of cinematic westerns to judge it impartially. And I'll never forget that night, when I saw it with my father, I didn't care much about the story until that young blondish guy introduced himself by "William Bonney" and the other said "Pat Garrett", I told my dad, "hey, it's Billy the Kid, and this is the guy who'll kill him" The movie took a whole new direction for me and it immediately grabbed my interest. And the rest didn't disappoint me. "Young Guns" is a movie whose rooting process is slow but efficient, you definitely get into the story when the tutor, John Tunstall, remarkably played by Terrence Stamp, is killed by men who belongs to the cattle owner and biggest competitor, the evil Murphy, Jack Palance whose evil smirk hasn't lost its touch either. Then, the 'young guns' are mandated as 'regulators' to arrest the killers, then it all gets wrong when Billy, the previously underestimated newcomer makes this business personal. He makes himself an enemy through Dick, Charlie Sheen, the straight man of the bunch, who'll get killed as if fate wanted another kind of leader, and progressively, as blood is shed and guns are fired, we get into the others, Doc, Kiefer Sutherland as the poet in love with a little Chinese girl sold to Murphy for a dirty shirt, Chavez, Philips as the only surviving of a Navajo tribe killed by Murphy's men with the army as accomplice, and of course, his 'friend', the scene-stealing tobacco-chewing "Dirty" Steve. But the one who touched my heart the most was Simeaczko as Charley Bowder, the nicest and most friendly (also cowardly) of the bunch. It was a nice touch for the story to have a character who doesn't react as a coldblooded killer but feels sick from the simple thought that he might be hanged, and his evolution is also one of the most rewarding aspects of the film, as I never fail to have goose bumps in the scene where he finally overcomes his fear and start getting into the shootout that concludes the film. And talking of the shootout, it's certainly one of my all-time favorite climactic sequences because I never saw the way it started coming and the amount of thrills is so great that at the end, me and my Dad, sorry, my Dad and me  could only wow, and I knew I had just watched one of the greatest films ever. Yes, "Young Guns" became one of my all-time favorite films because of so many things, the extraordinary performance of Emilio Estevez, the difference between the characters and my rooting for each of them, the amazing shootout, the coming-of-age story and beyond everything, the emotional core of the film: a great message about solidarity and friendship, as mentioned by the concluding line of the film : "Pals", before followed by one hell of an amazing soundtrack. So say what you want, it may not be the best Western ever made, it didn't get any Oscar nominations, but for some reason, it will forever have a special place in my heart.

    Young Guns tells the story of 'Billy the Kid' one more time, and after seeing so many versions of the same story, you can not help comparing, but with good results. Emilio Estevez is very good as Billy, and also Kiefer Sutherland and Charlie Sheen as his friends.Young Guns suffers from the fact that the action scenes are kind of confusing, because of the camera work that tries to be original. You see a lot of close ups where long distance views would be more clarifying. There is a good scene where they shoot at Buckshot Roberts, and also great moments when Billy shows a sense of humor. The relationships in the group, at the beginning when Charlie Sheen is the leader and how Estevez begins to take his place are also well presented. The Irish Jack Palance fighting the English Terence Stamp makes a good point of how they brought their troubles home to the west. Basically this film is a celebration of the young promising actors, playing with guns.It makes you think of an 'Ocean's Eleven' of the West.

    I have not seen a lot of westerns so I don't pretend to be some expert on western movies. However this is without a doubt one of the best westerns of all-time and my favorite western of all-time. I know some people criticize this film for not being historically accurate or a shallow attempt to be a "hip" western. Well, the truth is this film is not 100% accurate with history but what movie is? I liked the idea of this being a hip western staring Hollywood's "brat pack" with rock music playing in the background. I think it fits because this is basically a story about Billy the kid, a outlaw who was under 20 years old so it makes sense to give this one a younger or hipper feel to it. I like the Billy the kid story and I've seen many movies about him but this is the best one for 3 reasons. 1: I liked that they started from the beginning, other films focus on the "later" years when he met Pat Garret. 2: I like that this is more about the gang and not just about Billy. 3: Emilio Estevez is the best Billy the kid. I think the story is very well done, it's the best depiction of the Lincoln county war in New Mexico and the changes made were for the better. Like in real life John Tunstall was only twenty something and their were about a dozen or so "regulaters" not just the 6 shown here but the changes made worked for the better. The film is well directed by Chris Cain with a great balance of action, humor and is appropriately violent. I also like the look of the film, it really makes you feel like their in the wild west during 1878 and not on some sound stage. It also has a great cast! With the great Terrance Stamp who's perfectly cast as John Tunstall, an older English man who takes in six young rebellious men to work at his cattle ranch. The villain is the always great Jack Palance as Murphy, who kills Tunstal, starting the war. The 6 young boys search for justice so they become sheriffs but thanks to Billy killing everyone who they're supposed to arrest, they become outlaws. I LOVE Emillio Estevez as Billy the Kid. I know many would say his interpretation is not historically accurate but I think it's much more the way we would like to imagine the kid. Emillio gives one of his best performances and he was cheated out of an Oscar nomination. I think they did a great job in blending a lot of color to the kid. Billy is a lot of things in this movie, he's cocky, rebellious, trigger-happy, a little crazy, a loyal friend, and charming. Billy is perfectly portrayed as an anti-hero like he should be. Emillio always makes him likable even if we know he's a little crazy. I do like how they make Billy a little crazy as he takes pleasure in killing his enemies. His kills are marked by his unforgettable giggle, I love Emillio's lunatic sounding laugh. Billy is fearless who enjoys the thrill of life or death situations. But despite his wild behavior he's extremely loyal to his friends which gives him a lot of heart. Kiefer Sutherland is great as the more sensitive "Doc", one of my favorite performances of his. I love Lou Diamond Phillips as Chavez Y Chavez, possibly his best role and I love his knife skills. Dermot Mulloney is great as "dirty" Steve and he has a lot of funny moments. Casey Siemasko is great as Charlie, the more scared one of the bunch. I love Charlie Sheen as Dick, the appointed leader of the gang. I like how he fought for leadership of the regulators with his real life brother Emillio as Billy. I like the name of the gang as "the regulators", that's a cool name. The film has non stop action, good humor, good characters and the theme of friendship works well here.I love the rock'n'roll theme music. I like that they show Emillio/Billy take the now famous Billy the kid picture as well. One of my favorite movies of all-time.

    At the end of the movie, Billy and his gang are holed up in the house of their lawyer which is completely surrounded by hundreds of lawmen, bounty hunters, and the U.S Army. Even Doc says "Billy we're good, but this is getting ridiculous.". After the house is set on fire, Chavez escapes and somehow sneaks right past the men outside. Billy and his gang exit the house guns a blazin' right in front of a Gatling gun the Army has brought which mysteriously is not used. Chavez rides back with 3 horses, rides right through the men outside, jumps the horses over a barricade, and Billy and Doc somehow manage to mount the horses and ride right through the men down the street with not one shot fired. Then to top it all off, the lawyer emerges from the house and the Army pumps about 100 bullets into him with the same Gatling gun that for some reason they didn't use on Billy and his gang. It gets better, Billy then rides back, stops in the middle of the street, pops a cap into Murphy, and then rides off with no shots fired at him. Of course the gang then just rides off into the sunset, why would the US Army bother to pursue? This was a ridiculous, unbelievable ending and completely ruined the entire movie.

    I will firstly admit that I did not pay the fullest attention to this film while it was on, but I did understand everything going on, and I knew it was going to bit of an average film anyway, but still one I was interested in because of the all-star cast, from director Christopher Cain (The Next Karate Kid). Basically, set in 1878 in New Mexico, young gun men are picked up on the road by John Tunstall (Terence Stamp) to work on his ranch, but they also learn to read and be civilised, but competitive cattle seller and rich rancher Lawrence G. Murphy (Jack Palance) is hanging around and acting suspiciously. Tunstall is shot by Murphy's men during a scuffle, because Sheriff Brady (Daniel 'Danny' Kamin) is one of the gang Justice Wilson (Victor Izay) can't do anything about the situation, but attorney Alex McSween (Lost's Terry O'Quinn) persuades him to recruit the young men as deputies and give them the warrants to arrest the murderers. The young men: William H. Bonney (Emilio Estevez), who later becomes the infamous 'Billy the Kid', Josiah Gordon 'Doc' Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland), 'Jose' Chavez y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips), Richard 'Dick' Brewer (Charlie Sheen), Dirty Steve Stephens (Dermot Mulroney) and Charles 'Charley' Bowdre (Casey Siemaszko), do not intend to arrest the killers though, they just want to shoot them. After Dick and one of the others is killed the five remaining young gun men have the final showdown with Murphy and his gang, and Billy of course went on to become an outlaw and was eventually shot dead by Patrick Floyd 'Pat' Garrett (Patrick Wayne). Also starring Sharon Thomas Cain as Susan McSween, Brian Keith as Buckshot Roberts and Cody Palance, Jack's son as Baker. The cast all do their parts fine, especially Esteves in the leading role of the well known gunslinger, I may not have followed the story in full, but the action sequences are good to watch with all the guns firing and some blood, a not bad western. Worth watching!

    Young Guns is directed by Christopher Cain and written by John Fusco. It stars Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney, Casey Siemaszko, Terry O'Quinn, Jack Palance and Terence Stamp. Music is by Brian Banks and Anthony Marinelli and cinematography is by Dean Semler. Film is a telling of Billy the Kid's part in the Lincoln County War in New Mexico 1878. Plot sees the murder of John Tunstall send Billy and the rest of the Tunstall Regulators on a mission to avenge his murder. It ain't easy having pals. Often derided by Western movie purists as a sort of MTV Western made to showcase the various talents of the then Hollywood Brat Pack of Estevez, Sheen, Sutherland et al, Young Guns is actually a far more entertaining picture than some critical assessments suggest it is. It also has some rock solid Western history footings holding it up, yes it's far from accurate in various scenarios, age of characters and numbers in gangs etc, but the core story of the Lincoln County War is there. A massive success at the box office and spawning an equally successful sequel in 1990, Young Guns zips along at pace, contains high energy action sequences and provides plenty of quotable dialogue. Best of all, though, it doesn't take itself seriously, it wants to be a rooting-tooting Western of fun endeavours, if viewed on those terms it's an absolute winner, especially since the cast are playing it that way. Alex, if you stay they're gonna kill you. And then I'm gonna have to go around and kill all the guys who killed you. That's a lot of killing. Estevez is terrific as The Kid, blending boyish arrogance with fearless rage, a fun and scary character who is easy to get on the saddle with. Elsewhere it's a mixed bag, but apart from the disappointing Sheen, the casting decisions sit well and if you talk to ten different Young Guns fans you will most likely get a number of different answers come back as to who is their favourite Regulator (mine is Dirty Steve played by Mulroney if you are wondering?). O'Quinn is spot on as Alex McSween, Stamp adds classical tones to the ill fated John Tunstall and Palance is a neat fit as villain Lawrence Murphy. Nice to see Brian Keith get a cameo as a larger than life bounty hunter as well. Semler's photography and Cain's filming techniques are a bit too anachronistic at times and the Banks/Marinelli score too modern an accompaniment on occasions. But film rounds out as a nifty bit of Oater play for Gen X and showed that as the 1990s approached there was still love for this greatest of genres. 7.5/10

    Really good story on the rise of Billy the Kid and his fellow cohorts. The historical accuracy of the movie probably isn't perfect but if you're not looking for a history channel version of his story then the story is perfectly fine and still hits on a lot of the major points in Billy the Kid and his problems with the Murphy gang. The cast consists of a who's who of young actors in the late '80s with Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips. If you're looking for a fun western then this is a movie for you. Good shootout scenes and Estevez plays the role of his career as Billy. Much better done then any other movie about Billy's life.

    and the result was this abomination of a movie and butchering of history. Anyone who doesn't think this movie is drek should watch a real western, "The Unforgiven" or "Tombstone" or even "The Searchers" with John Wayne. This movie is just Charlie and Emilio and their buddies getting paid to ride horses, wear cool clothes, and play with guns. Avoid it like the plague, along with the sequel (why???) and their other terrible outing, "The Three Musketeers" otherwise known as; the Brat Pack wanted to wear more cool costumes, play with swords and get paid for it. They're even less believable as Musketeers than they are as gunfighters.

    For images and story. For music and subtle details of a interior war. For the science to make nuances in perfect place. For Martijn Lakemeier play and for the end - crush of spell. In fact, for the art to describe a war as mixture of trust, friendship, courage and measure of truth in the eyes of a boy. Limits and force of gestures. Hope and power of small pieces of day. Sacrifice as way to be and snow like cell of shadows. And love - sketch of real values. It is difficult to say more. May be movie of a self definition or only fragment by a historical event. Few hours of a hero or circle of resistance. For every person - a slice. From a poem.

    This movie is watchable. The best performing actor by a mile is Jack Palance, making much out of a shallow character. From the younger bunch (Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Casey Siemaszko, Dermut Mulroney and Emilio Estevez) only the last one is worth mentioning as rather decent. The plot is predictable all the way even if you are not very familiar with Billy the Kid. Talking history, don't expect to pick up anything from history. Movies are not the best place to learn history and this one doesn't make an exception. The soundtrack is not very exciting either. So what make it watchable ? The settings are really quality. In every scene you can feel a bit of that dust and the desert-like weather. And the action. If you take some of your precious time to spend on "Young Guns", you are not looking for some mind-boggling drama, are you ? There are many sequences of shooting, bloodshed, revenge and quarry. That's the best of it. If you consider yourself thin-skinned, don't even bother to watch. Apart from some nonsensical dialogs, a dislocated speech here and there to give you some "history", it boils down to guns going off. And it won't let you down in this very aspect. The accents are another annoyance. But what disappoints immensely is Charlie Sheen, whose awfulness kills his character into the first 30 minutes. It is a blessing. And his movie career didn't actually take off. Go figure ! 5 out of 10

His kills are marked by his unforgettable giggle, I love Emillio's lunatic sounding laugh. Billy is fearless who enjoys the thrill of life or death situations. But despite his wild behavior he's extremely loyal to his friends which gives him a lot of heart. Kiefer Sutherland is great as the more sensitive "Doc", one of my favorite performances of his. I love Lou Diamond Phillips as Chavez Y Chavez, possibly his best role and I love his knife skills. Dermot Mulloney is great as "dirty" Steve and he has a lot of funny moments. Casey Siemasko is great as Charlie, the more scared one of the bunch. I love Charlie Sheen as Dick, the appointed leader of the gang. I like how he fought for leadership of the regulators with his real life brother Emillio as Billy. I like the name of the gang as "the regulators", that's a cool name. The film has non stop action, good humor, good characters and the theme of friendship works well here.I love the rock'n'roll theme music. I like that they show Emillio/Billy take the now famous Billy the kid picture as well. One of my favorite movies of all-time.

    At the end of the movie, Billy and his gang are holed up in the house of their lawyer which is completely surrounded by hundreds of lawmen, bounty hunters, and the U.S Army. Even Doc says "Billy we're good, but this is getting ridiculous.". After the house is set on fire, Chavez escapes and somehow sneaks right past the men outside. Billy and his gang exit the house guns a blazin' right in front of a Gatling gun the Army has brought which mysteriously is not used. Chavez rides back with 3 horses, rides right through the men outside, jumps the horses over a barricade, and Billy and Doc somehow manage to mount the horses and ride right through the men down the street with not one shot fired. Then to top it all off, the lawyer emerges from the house and the Army pumps about 100 bullets into him with the same Gatling gun that for some reason they didn't use on Billy and his gang. It gets better, Billy then rides back, stops in the middle of the street, pops a cap into Murphy, and then rides off with no shots fired at him. Of course the gang then just rides off into the sunset, why would the US Army bother to pursue? This was a ridiculous, unbelievable ending and completely ruined the entire movie.

    I will firstly admit that I did not pay the fullest attention to this film while it was on, but I did understand everything going on, and I knew it was going to bit of an average film anyway, but still one I was interested in because of the all-star cast, from director Christopher Cain (The Next Karate Kid). Basically, set in 1878 in New Mexico, young gun men are picked up on the road by John Tunstall (Terence Stamp) to work on his ranch, but they also learn to read and be civilised, but competitive cattle seller and rich rancher Lawrence G. Murphy (Jack Palance) is hanging around and acting suspiciously. Tunstall is shot by Murphy's men during a scuffle, because Sheriff Brady (Daniel 'Danny' Kamin) is one of the gang Justice Wilson (Victor Izay) can't do anything about the situation, but attorney Alex McSween (Lost's Terry O'Quinn) persuades him to recruit the young men as deputies and give them the warrants to arrest the murderers. The young men: William H. Bonney (Emilio Estevez), who later becomes the infamous 'Billy the Kid', Josiah Gordon 'Doc' Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland), 'Jose' Chavez y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips), Richard 'Dick' Brewer (Charlie Sheen), Dirty Steve Stephens (Dermot Mulroney) and Charles 'Charley' Bowdre (Casey Siemaszko), do not intend to arrest the killers though, they just want to shoot them. After Dick and one of the others is killed the five remaining young gun men have the final showdown with Murphy and his gang, and Billy of course went on to become an outlaw and was eventually shot dead by Patrick Floyd 'Pat' Garrett (Patrick Wayne). Also starring Sharon Thomas Cain as Susan McSween, Brian Keith as Buckshot Roberts and Cody Palance, Jack's son as Baker. The cast all do their parts fine, especially Esteves in the leading role of the well known gunslinger, I may not have followed the story in full, but the action sequences are good to watch with all the guns firing and some blood, a not bad western. Worth watching!

    Young Guns is directed by Christopher Cain and written by John Fusco. It stars Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney, Casey Siemaszko, Terry O'Quinn, Jack Palance and Terence Stamp. Music is by Brian Banks and Anthony Marinelli and cinematography is by Dean Semler. Film is a telling of Billy the Kid's part in the Lincoln County War in New Mexico 1878. Plot sees the murder of John Tunstall send Billy and the rest of the Tunstall Regulators on a mission to avenge his murder. It ain't easy having pals. Often derided by Western movie purists as a sort of MTV Western made to showcase the various talents of the then Hollywood Brat Pack of Estevez, Sheen, Sutherland et al, Young Guns is actually a far more entertaining picture than some critical assessments suggest it is. It also has some rock solid Western history footings holding it up, yes it's far from accurate in various scenarios, age of characters and numbers in gangs etc, but the core story of the Lincoln County War is there. A massive success at the box office and spawning an equally successful sequel in 1990, Young Guns zips along at pace, contains high energy action sequences and provides plenty of quotable dialogue. Best of all, though, it doesn't take itself seriously, it wants to be a rooting-tooting Western of fun endeavours, if viewed on those terms it's an absolute winner, especially since the cast are playing it that way. Alex, if you stay they're gonna kill you. And then I'm gonna have to go around and kill all the guys who killed you. That's a lot of killing. Estevez is terrific as The Kid, blending boyish arrogance with fearless rage, a fun and scary character who is easy to get on the saddle with. Elsewhere it's a mixed bag, but apart from the disappointing Sheen, the casting decisions sit well and if you talk to ten different Young Guns fans you will most likely get a number of different answers come back as to who is their favourite Regulator (mine is Dirty Steve played by Mulroney if you are wondering?). O'Quinn is spot on as Alex McSween, Stamp adds classical tones to the ill fated John Tunstall and Palance is a neat fit as villain Lawrence Murphy. Nice to see Brian Keith get a cameo as a larger than life bounty hunter as well. Semler's photography and Cain's filming techniques are a bit too anachronistic at times and the Banks/Marinelli score too modern an accompaniment on occasions. But film rounds out as a nifty bit of Oater play for Gen X and showed that as the 1990s approached there was still love for this greatest of genres. 7.5/10

    Really good story on the rise of Billy the Kid and his fellow cohorts. The historical accuracy of the movie probably isn't perfect but if you're not looking for a history channel version of his story then the story is perfectly fine and still hits on a lot of the major points in Billy the Kid and his problems with the Murphy gang. The cast consists of a who's who of young actors in the late '80s with Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips. If you're looking for a fun western then this is a movie for you. Good shootout scenes and Estevez plays the role of his career as Billy. Much better done then any other movie about Billy's life.

    and the result was this abomination of a movie and butchering of history. Anyone who doesn't think this movie is drek should watch a real western, "The Unforgiven" or "Tombstone" or even "The Searchers" with John Wayne. This movie is just Charlie and Emilio and their buddies getting paid to ride horses, wear cool clothes, and play with guns. Avoid it like the plague, along with the sequel (why???) and their other terrible outing, "The Three Musketeers" otherwise known as; the Brat Pack wanted to wear more cool costumes, play with swords and get paid for it. They're even less believable as Musketeers than they are as gunfighters.

    For images and story. For music and subtle details of a interior war. For the science to make nuances in perfect place. For Martijn Lakemeier play and for the end - crush of spell. In fact, for the art to describe a war as mixture of trust, friendship, courage and measure of truth in the eyes of a boy. Limits and force of gestures. Hope and power of small pieces of day. Sacrifice as way to be and snow like cell of shadows. And love - sketch of real values. It is difficult to say more. May be movie of a self definition or only fragment by a historical event. Few hours of a hero or circle of resistance. For every person - a slice. From a poem.

    This movie is watchable. The best performing actor by a mile is Jack Palance, making much out of a shallow character. From the younger bunch (Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Casey Siemaszko, Dermut Mulroney and Emilio Estevez) only the last one is worth mentioning as rather decent. The plot is predictable all the way even if you are not very familiar with Billy the Kid. Talking history, don't expect to pick up anything from history. Movies are not the best place to learn history and this one doesn't make an exception. The soundtrack is not very exciting either. So what make it watchable ? The settings are really quality. In every scene you can feel a bit of that dust and the desert-like weather. And the action. If you take some of your precious time to spend on "Young Guns", you are not looking for some mind-boggling drama, are you ? There are many sequences of shooting, bloodshed, revenge and quarry. That's the best of it. If you consider yourself thin-skinned, don't even bother to watch. Apart from some nonsensical dialogs, a dislocated speech here and there to give you some "history", it boils down to guns going off. And it won't let you down in this very aspect. The accents are another annoyance. But what disappoints immensely is Charlie Sheen, whose awfulness kills his character into the first 30 minutes. It is a blessing. And his movie career didn't actually take off. Go figure ! 5 out of 10

    It seems that the 80's were so flooded by the "Star Wars" and "Rocky" films, by Steven Spielberg's "Indiana Jones" and so many other blockbusters such as "Top Gun" or "Terminator" that it didn't leave much room for some little gems like "Biloxi Blues" or "Barfly" or let's say for the Western genre, "Young Guns"  one of my favorite westerns ever. Maybe, I'm using 'one of' as an understatement, as if I was ashamed to say 'm favorite', but I am not, I just gained some maturity, I saw more westerns since the day I discovered "Young Guns", and I can understand why this movie didn't get much acclaim, especially if you consider the period, the 80's, when Eastwood the director was reconquering the genre, and through "Pale Rider" prepared the audience to a darker form of revisionist westerns. "Young Guns" with its youthful cast introduced by one my all-time favorite intros: Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Casey Siemaczko and Dermot Mulroney, looks closer to the typical 80's film marketed for teenage audiences than a mature film meant to be taken seriously, on the surface only  because if you watch it, and decide to appreciate the film regardless of your personal tastes  well, I defy anyone not to be captivated by theses 100 minutes of pure entertainment. Yes, even the dark "Pale Rider" pales in comparison with "Young Guns", because the latter doesn't overdo the archetypes of the genre, it has its load of thrills, of chases, shootouts, parties, romances, discussions BUT with something more that lacks even in the most acclaimed masterpieces of the genre : it has characters, a wonderful gallery of characters, who carry their personalities less than stereotypes than true human flows, with their motives, actions and reactions, and within the plot of the film, there are different arcs involving each of these characters, handled with such a confidence, that nothing ever feels forced or clich&eacute;, and at the end, each of them would ultimately change, making "Young Guns" more than a Western but also a sort of coming-of-age story, a genre cherished during the 80's. And of course, the biggest change will concern the leader of the bunch who'll become one of the most defining legends of the Old West. As a kid, I grew up reading "The Adventures of Lucky Luke", a Franco-Belgian comic book set in the Old West, needless to say that I loved it so much, I was familiar with Billy the Kid, the stagecoaches, Jesse James, Calamity Jane, the Conquest of the West before I reached my tenth year, so I discovered "Young Guns" at the age of 13, with enough knowledge of the Old West to appreciate it and not enough of cinematic westerns to judge it impartially. And I'll never forget that night, when I saw it with my father, I didn't care much about the story until that young blondish guy introduced himself by "William Bonney" and the other said "Pat Garrett", I told my dad, "hey, it's Billy the Kid, and this is the guy who'll kill him" The movie took a whole new direction for me and it immediately grabbed my interest. And the rest didn't disappoint me. "Young Guns" is a movie whose rooting process is slow but efficient, you definitely get into the story when the tutor, John Tunstall, remarkably played by Terrence Stamp, is killed by men who belongs to the cattle owner and biggest competitor, the evil Murphy, Jack Palance whose evil smirk hasn't lost its touch either. Then, the 'young guns' are mandated as 'regulators' to arrest the killers, then it all gets wrong when Billy, the previously underestimated newcomer makes this business personal. He makes himself an enemy through Dick, Charlie Sheen, the straight man of the bunch, who'll get killed as if fate wanted another kind of leader, and progressively, as blood is shed and guns are fired, we get into the others, Doc, Kiefer Sutherland as the poet in love with a little Chinese girl sold to Murphy for a dirty shirt, Chavez, Philips as the only surviving of a Navajo tribe killed by Murphy's men with the army as accomplice, and of course, his 'friend', the scene-stealing tobacco-chewing "Dirty" Steve. But the one who touched my heart the most was Simeaczko as Charley Bowder, the nicest and most friendly (also cowardly) of the bunch. It was a nice touch for the story to have a character who doesn't react as a coldblooded killer but feels sick from the simple thought that he might be hanged, and his evolution is also one of the most rewarding aspects of the film, as I never fail to have goose bumps in the scene where he finally overcomes his fear and start getting into the shootout that concludes the film. And talking of the shootout, it's certainly one of my all-time favorite climactic sequences because I never saw the way it started coming and the amount of thrills is so great that at the end, me and my Dad, sorry, my Dad and me  could only wow, and I knew I had just watched one of the greatest films ever. Yes, "Young Guns" became one of my all-time favorite films because of so many things, the extraordinary performance of Emilio Estevez, the difference between the characters and my rooting for each of them, the amazing shootout, the coming-of-age story and beyond everything, the emotional core of the film: a great message about solidarity and friendship, as mentioned by the concluding line of the film : "Pals", before followed by one hell of an amazing soundtrack. So say what you want, it may not be the best Western ever made, it didn't get any Oscar nominations, but for some reason, it will forever have a special place in my heart.

    Young Guns tells the story of 'Billy the Kid' one more time, and after seeing so many versions of the same story, you can not help comparing, but with good results. Emilio Estevez is very good as Billy, and also Kiefer Sutherland and Charlie Sheen as his friends.Young Guns suffers from the fact that the action scenes are kind of confusing, because of the camera work that tries to be original. You see a lot of close ups where long distance views would be more clarifying. There is a good scene where they shoot at Buckshot Roberts, and also great moments when Billy shows a sense of humor. The relationships in the group, at the beginning when Charlie Sheen is the leader and how Estevez begins to take his place are also well presented. The Irish Jack Palance fighting the English Terence Stamp makes a good point of how they brought their troubles home to the west. Basically this film is a celebration of the young promising actors, playing with guns.It makes you think of an 'Ocean's Eleven' of the West.

    I have not seen a lot of westerns so I don't pretend to be some expert on western movies. However this is without a doubt one of the best westerns of all-time and my favorite western of all-time. I know some people criticize this film for not being historically accurate or a shallow attempt to be a "hip" western. Well, the truth is this film is not 100% accurate with history but what movie is? I liked the idea of this being a hip western staring Hollywood's "brat pack" with rock music playing in the background. I think it fits because this is basically a story about Billy the kid, a outlaw who was under 20 years old so it makes sense to give this one a younger or hipper feel to it. I like the Billy the kid story and I've seen many movies about him but this is the best one for 3 reasons. 1: I liked that they started from the beginning, other films focus on the "later" years when he met Pat Garret. 2: I like that this is more about the gang and not just about Billy. 3: Emilio Estevez is the best Billy the kid. I think the story is very well done, it's the best depiction of the Lincoln county war in New Mexico and the changes made were for the better. Like in real life John Tunstall was only twenty something and their were about a dozen or so "regulaters" not just the 6 shown here but the changes made worked for the better. The film is well directed by Chris Cain with a great balance of action, humor and is appropriately violent. I also like the look of the film, it really makes you feel like their in the wild west during 1878 and not on some sound stage. It also has a great cast! With the great Terrance Stamp who's perfectly cast as John Tunstall, an older English man who takes in six young rebellious men to work at his cattle ranch. The villain is the always great Jack Palance as Murphy, who kills Tunstal, starting the war. The 6 young boys search for justice so they become sheriffs but thanks to Billy killing everyone who they're supposed to arrest, they become outlaws. I LOVE Emillio Estevez as Billy the Kid. I know many would say his interpretation is not historically accurate but I think it's much more the way we would like to imagine the kid. Emillio gives one of his best performances and he was cheated out of an Oscar nomination. I think they did a great job in blending a lot of color to the kid. Billy is a lot of things in this movie, he's cocky, rebellious, trigger-happy, a little crazy, a loyal friend, and charming. Billy is perfectly portrayed as an anti-hero like he should be. Emillio always makes him likable even if we know he's a little crazy. I do like how they make Billy a little crazy as he takes pleasure in killing his enemies. His kills are marked by his unforgettable giggle, I love Emillio's lunatic sounding laugh. Billy is fearless who enjoys the thrill of life or death situations. But despite his wild behavior he's extremely loyal to his friends which gives him a lot of heart. Kiefer Sutherland is great as the more sensitive "Doc", one of my favorite performances of his. I love Lou Diamond Phillips as Chavez Y Chavez, possibly his best role and I love his knife skills. Dermot Mulloney is great as "dirty" Steve and he has a lot of funny moments. Casey Siemasko is great as Charlie, the more scared one of the bunch. I love Charlie Sheen as Dick, the appointed leader of the gang. I like how he fought for leadership of the regulators with his real life brother Emillio as Billy. I like the name of the gang as "the regulators", that's a cool name. The film has non stop action, good humor, good characters and the theme of friendship works well here.I love the rock'n'roll theme music. I like that they show Emillio/Billy take the now famous Billy the kid picture as well. One of my favorite movies of all-time.

Anyone who doesn't think this movie is drek should watch a real western, "The Unforgiven" or "Tombstone" or even "The Searchers" with John Wayne. This movie is just Charlie and Emilio and their buddies getting paid to ride horses, wear cool clothes, and play with guns. Avoid it like the plague, along with the sequel (why???) and their other terrible outing, "The Three Musketeers" otherwise known as; the Brat Pack wanted to wear more cool costumes, play with swords and get paid for it. They're even less believable as Musketeers than they are as gunfighters.

    This movie is watchable. The best performing actor by a mile is Jack Palance, making much out of a shallow character. From the younger bunch (Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Casey Siemaszko, Dermut Mulroney and Emilio Estevez) only the last one is worth mentioning as rather decent. The plot is predictable all the way even if you are not very familiar with Billy the Kid. Talking history, don't expect to pick up anything from history. Movies are not the best place to learn history and this one doesn't make an exception. The soundtrack is not very exciting either. So what make it watchable ? The settings are really quality. In every scene you can feel a bit of that dust and the desert-like weather. And the action. If you take some of your precious time to spend on "Young Guns", you are not looking for some mind-boggling drama, are you ? There are many sequences of shooting, bloodshed, revenge and quarry. That's the best of it. If you consider yourself thin-skinned, don't even bother to watch. Apart from some nonsensical dialogs, a dislocated speech here and there to give you some "history", it boils down to guns going off. And it won't let you down in this very aspect. The accents are another annoyance. But what disappoints immensely is Charlie Sheen, whose awfulness kills his character into the first 30 minutes. It is a blessing. And his movie career didn't actually take off. Go figure ! 5 out of 10

    It seems that the 80's were so flooded by the "Star Wars" and "Rocky" films, by Steven Spielberg's "Indiana Jones" and so many other blockbusters such as "Top Gun" or "Terminator" that it didn't leave much room for some little gems like "Biloxi Blues" or "Barfly" or let's say for the Western genre, "Young Guns"  one of my favorite westerns ever. Maybe, I'm using 'one of' as an understatement, as if I was ashamed to say 'm favorite', but I am not, I just gained some maturity, I saw more westerns since the day I discovered "Young Guns", and I can understand why this movie didn't get much acclaim, especially if you consider the period, the 80's, when Eastwood the director was reconquering the genre, and through "Pale Rider" prepared the audience to a darker form of revisionist westerns. "Young Guns" with its youthful cast introduced by one my all-time favorite intros: Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Casey Siemaczko and Dermot Mulroney, looks closer to the typical 80's film marketed for teenage audiences than a mature film meant to be taken seriously, on the surface only  because if you watch it, and decide to appreciate the film regardless of your personal tastes  well, I defy anyone not to be captivated by theses 100 minutes of pure entertainment. Yes, even the dark "Pale Rider" pales in comparison with "Young Guns", because the latter doesn't overdo the archetypes of the genre, it has its load of thrills, of chases, shootouts, parties, romances, discussions BUT with something more that lacks even in the most acclaimed masterpieces of the genre : it has characters, a wonderful gallery of characters, who carry their personalities less than stereotypes than true human flows, with their motives, actions and reactions, and within the plot of the film, there are different arcs involving each of these characters, handled with such a confidence, that nothing ever feels forced or clich&eacute;, and at the end, each of them would ultimately change, making "Young Guns" more than a Western but also a sort of coming-of-age story, a genre cherished during the 80's. And of course, the biggest change will concern the leader of the bunch who'll become one of the most defining legends of the Old West. As a kid, I grew up reading "The Adventures of Lucky Luke", a Franco-Belgian comic book set in the Old West, needless to say that I loved it so much, I was familiar with Billy the Kid, the stagecoaches, Jesse James, Calamity Jane, the Conquest of the West before I reached my tenth year, so I discovered "Young Guns" at the age of 13, with enough knowledge of the Old West to appreciate it and not enough of cinematic westerns to judge it impartially. And I'll never forget that night, when I saw it with my father, I didn't care much about the story until that young blondish guy introduced himself by "William Bonney" and the other said "Pat Garrett", I told my dad, "hey, it's Billy the Kid, and this is the guy who'll kill him" The movie took a whole new direction for me and it immediately grabbed my interest. And the rest didn't disappoint me. "Young Guns" is a movie whose rooting process is slow but efficient, you definitely get into the story when the tutor, John Tunstall, remarkably played by Terrence Stamp, is killed by men who belongs to the cattle owner and biggest competitor, the evil Murphy, Jack Palance whose evil smirk hasn't lost its touch either. Then, the 'young guns' are mandated as 'regulators' to arrest the killers, then it all gets wrong when Billy, the previously underestimated newcomer makes this business personal. He makes himself an enemy through Dick, Charlie Sheen, the straight man of the bunch, who'll get killed as if fate wanted another kind of leader, and progressively, as blood is shed and guns are fired, we get into the others, Doc, Kiefer Sutherland as the poet in love with a little Chinese girl sold to Murphy for a dirty shirt, Chavez, Philips as the only surviving of a Navajo tribe killed by Murphy's men with the army as accomplice, and of course, his 'friend', the scene-stealing tobacco-chewing "Dirty" Steve. But the one who touched my heart the most was Simeaczko as Charley Bowder, the nicest and most friendly (also cowardly) of the bunch. It was a nice touch for the story to have a character who doesn't react as a coldblooded killer but feels sick from the simple thought that he might be hanged, and his evolution is also one of the most rewarding aspects of the film, as I never fail to have goose bumps in the scene where he finally overcomes his fear and start getting into the shootout that concludes the film. And talking of the shootout, it's certainly one of my all-time favorite climactic sequences because I never saw the way it started coming and the amount of thrills is so great that at the end, me and my Dad, sorry, my Dad and me  could only wow, and I knew I had just watched one of the greatest films ever. Yes, "Young Guns" became one of my all-time favorite films because of so many things, the extraordinary performance of Emilio Estevez, the difference between the characters and my rooting for each of them, the amazing shootout, the coming-of-age story and beyond everything, the emotional core of the film: a great message about solidarity and friendship, as mentioned by the concluding line of the film : "Pals", before followed by one hell of an amazing soundtrack. So say what you want, it may not be the best Western ever made, it didn't get any Oscar nominations, but for some reason, it will forever have a special place in my heart.

    Young Guns tells the story of 'Billy the Kid' one more time, and after seeing so many versions of the same story, you can not help comparing, but with good results. Emilio Estevez is very good as Billy, and also Kiefer Sutherland and Charlie Sheen as his friends.Young Guns suffers from the fact that the action scenes are kind of confusing, because of the camera work that tries to be original. You see a lot of close ups where long distance views would be more clarifying. There is a good scene where they shoot at Buckshot Roberts, and also great moments when Billy shows a sense of humor. The relationships in the group, at the beginning when Charlie Sheen is the leader and how Estevez begins to take his place are also well presented. The Irish Jack Palance fighting the English Terence Stamp makes a good point of how they brought their troubles home to the west. Basically this film is a celebration of the young promising actors, playing with guns.It makes you think of an 'Ocean's Eleven' of the West.

    I have not seen a lot of westerns so I don't pretend to be some expert on western movies. However this is without a doubt one of the best westerns of all-time and my favorite western of all-time. I know some people criticize this film for not being historically accurate or a shallow attempt to be a "hip" western. Well, the truth is this film is not 100% accurate with history but what movie is? I liked the idea of this being a hip western staring Hollywood's "brat pack" with rock music playing in the background. I think it fits because this is basically a story about Billy the kid, a outlaw who was under 20 years old so it makes sense to give this one a younger or hipper feel to it. I like the Billy the kid story and I've seen many movies about him but this is the best one for 3 reasons. 1: I liked that they started from the beginning, other films focus on the "later" years when he met Pat Garret. 2: I like that this is more about the gang and not just about Billy. 3: Emilio Estevez is the best Billy the kid. I think the story is very well done, it's the best depiction of the Lincoln county war in New Mexico and the changes made were for the better. Like in real life John Tunstall was only twenty something and their were about a dozen or so "regulaters" not just the 6 shown here but the changes made worked for the better. The film is well directed by Chris Cain with a great balance of action, humor and is appropriately violent. I also like the look of the film, it really makes you feel like their in the wild west during 1878 and not on some sound stage. It also has a great cast! With the great Terrance Stamp who's perfectly cast as John Tunstall, an older English man who takes in six young rebellious men to work at his cattle ranch. The villain is the always great Jack Palance as Murphy, who kills Tunstal, starting the war. The 6 young boys search for justice so they become sheriffs but thanks to Billy killing everyone who they're supposed to arrest, they become outlaws. I LOVE Emillio Estevez as Billy the Kid. I know many would say his interpretation is not historically accurate but I think it's much more the way we would like to imagine the kid. Emillio gives one of his best performances and he was cheated out of an Oscar nomination. I think they did a great job in blending a lot of color to the kid. Billy is a lot of things in this movie, he's cocky, rebellious, trigger-happy, a little crazy, a loyal friend, and charming. Billy is perfectly portrayed as an anti-hero like he should be. Emillio always makes him likable even if we know he's a little crazy. I do like how they make Billy a little crazy as he takes pleasure in killing his enemies. His kills are marked by his unforgettable giggle, I love Emillio's lunatic sounding laugh. Billy is fearless who enjoys the thrill of life or death situations. But despite his wild behavior he's extremely loyal to his friends which gives him a lot of heart. Kiefer Sutherland is great as the more sensitive "Doc", one of my favorite performances of his. I love Lou Diamond Phillips as Chavez Y Chavez, possibly his best role and I love his knife skills. Dermot Mulloney is great as "dirty" Steve and he has a lot of funny moments. Casey Siemasko is great as Charlie, the more scared one of the bunch. I love Charlie Sheen as Dick, the appointed leader of the gang. I like how he fought for leadership of the regulators with his real life brother Emillio as Billy. I like the name of the gang as "the regulators", that's a cool name. The film has non stop action, good humor, good characters and the theme of friendship works well here.I love the rock'n'roll theme music. I like that they show Emillio/Billy take the now famous Billy the kid picture as well. One of my favorite movies of all-time.

    At the end of the movie, Billy and his gang are holed up in the house of their lawyer which is completely surrounded by hundreds of lawmen, bounty hunters, and the U.S Army. Even Doc says "Billy we're good, but this is getting ridiculous.". After the house is set on fire, Chavez escapes and somehow sneaks right past the men outside. Billy and his gang exit the house guns a blazin' right in front of a Gatling gun the Army has brought which mysteriously is not used. Chavez rides back with 3 horses, rides right through the men outside, jumps the horses over a barricade, and Billy and Doc somehow manage to mount the horses and ride right through the men down the street with not one shot fired. Then to top it all off, the lawyer emerges from the house and the Army pumps about 100 bullets into him with the same Gatling gun that for some reason they didn't use on Billy and his gang. It gets better, Billy then rides back, stops in the middle of the street, pops a cap into Murphy, and then rides off with no shots fired at him. Of course the gang then just rides off into the sunset, why would the US Army bother to pursue? This was a ridiculous, unbelievable ending and completely ruined the entire movie.

    I will firstly admit that I did not pay the fullest attention to this film while it was on, but I did understand everything going on, and I knew it was going to bit of an average film anyway, but still one I was interested in because of the all-star cast, from director Christopher Cain (The Next Karate Kid). Basically, set in 1878 in New Mexico, young gun men are picked up on the road by John Tunstall (Terence Stamp) to work on his ranch, but they also learn to read and be civilised, but competitive cattle seller and rich rancher Lawrence G. Murphy (Jack Palance) is hanging around and acting suspiciously. Tunstall is shot by Murphy's men during a scuffle, because Sheriff Brady (Daniel 'Danny' Kamin) is one of the gang Justice Wilson (Victor Izay) can't do anything about the situation, but attorney Alex McSween (Lost's Terry O'Quinn) persuades him to recruit the young men as deputies and give them the warrants to arrest the murderers. The young men: William H. Bonney (Emilio Estevez), who later becomes the infamous 'Billy the Kid', Josiah Gordon 'Doc' Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland), 'Jose' Chavez y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips), Richard 'Dick' Brewer (Charlie Sheen), Dirty Steve Stephens (Dermot Mulroney) and Charles 'Charley' Bowdre (Casey Siemaszko), do not intend to arrest the killers though, they just want to shoot them. After Dick and one of the others is killed the five remaining young gun men have the final showdown with Murphy and his gang, and Billy of course went on to become an outlaw and was eventually shot dead by Patrick Floyd 'Pat' Garrett (Patrick Wayne). Also starring Sharon Thomas Cain as Susan McSween, Brian Keith as Buckshot Roberts and Cody Palance, Jack's son as Baker. The cast all do their parts fine, especially Esteves in the leading role of the well known gunslinger, I may not have followed the story in full, but the action sequences are good to watch with all the guns firing and some blood, a not bad western. Worth watching!

    Young Guns is directed by Christopher Cain and written by John Fusco. It stars Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney, Casey Siemaszko, Terry O'Quinn, Jack Palance and Terence Stamp. Music is by Brian Banks and Anthony Marinelli and cinematography is by Dean Semler. Film is a telling of Billy the Kid's part in the Lincoln County War in New Mexico 1878. Plot sees the murder of John Tunstall send Billy and the rest of the Tunstall Regulators on a mission to avenge his murder. It ain't easy having pals. Often derided by Western movie purists as a sort of MTV Western made to showcase the various talents of the then Hollywood Brat Pack of Estevez, Sheen, Sutherland et al, Young Guns is actually a far more entertaining picture than some critical assessments suggest it is. It also has some rock solid Western history footings holding it up, yes it's far from accurate in various scenarios, age of characters and numbers in gangs etc, but the core story of the Lincoln County War is there. A massive success at the box office and spawning an equally successful sequel in 1990, Young Guns zips along at pace, contains high energy action sequences and provides plenty of quotable dialogue. Best of all, though, it doesn't take itself seriously, it wants to be a rooting-tooting Western of fun endeavours, if viewed on those terms it's an absolute winner, especially since the cast are playing it that way. Alex, if you stay they're gonna kill you. And then I'm gonna have to go around and kill all the guys who killed you. That's a lot of killing. Estevez is terrific as The Kid, blending boyish arrogance with fearless rage, a fun and scary character who is easy to get on the saddle with. Elsewhere it's a mixed bag, but apart from the disappointing Sheen, the casting decisions sit well and if you talk to ten different Young Guns fans you will most likely get a number of different answers come back as to who is their favourite Regulator (mine is Dirty Steve played by Mulroney if you are wondering?). O'Quinn is spot on as Alex McSween, Stamp adds classical tones to the ill fated John Tunstall and Palance is a neat fit as villain Lawrence Murphy. Nice to see Brian Keith get a cameo as a larger than life bounty hunter as well. Semler's photography and Cain's filming techniques are a bit too anachronistic at times and the Banks/Marinelli score too modern an accompaniment on occasions. But film rounds out as a nifty bit of Oater play for Gen X and showed that as the 1990s approached there was still love for this greatest of genres. 7.5/10

    Really good story on the rise of Billy the Kid and his fellow cohorts. The historical accuracy of the movie probably isn't perfect but if you're not looking for a history channel version of his story then the story is perfectly fine and still hits on a lot of the major points in Billy the Kid and his problems with the Murphy gang. The cast consists of a who's who of young actors in the late '80s with Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips. If you're looking for a fun western then this is a movie for you. Good shootout scenes and Estevez plays the role of his career as Billy. Much better done then any other movie about Billy's life.

    It seems that the 80's were so flooded by the "Star Wars" and "Rocky" films, by Steven Spielberg's "Indiana Jones" and so many other blockbusters such as "Top Gun" or "Terminator" that it didn't leave much room for some little gems like "Biloxi Blues" or "Barfly" or let's say for the Western genre, "Young Guns"  one of my favorite westerns ever.

Emilio Estevez is very good as Billy, and also Kiefer Sutherland and Charlie Sheen as his friends.Young Guns suffers from the fact that the action scenes are kind of confusing, because of the camera work that tries to be original. You see a lot of close ups where long distance views would be more clarifying. There is a good scene where they shoot at Buckshot Roberts, and also great moments when Billy shows a sense of humor. The relationships in the group, at the beginning when Charlie Sheen is the leader and how Estevez begins to take his place are also well presented. The Irish Jack Palance fighting the English Terence Stamp makes a good point of how they brought their troubles home to the west. Basically this film is a celebration of the young promising actors, playing with guns.It makes you think of an 'Ocean's Eleven' of the West.

    I have not seen a lot of westerns so I don't pretend to be some expert on western movies. However this is without a doubt one of the best westerns of all-time and my favorite western of all-time. I know some people criticize this film for not being historically accurate or a shallow attempt to be a "hip" western. Well, the truth is this film is not 100% accurate with history but what movie is? I liked the idea of this being a hip western staring Hollywood's "brat pack" with rock music playing in the background. I think it fits because this is basically a story about Billy the kid, a outlaw who was under 20 years old so it makes sense to give this one a younger or hipper feel to it. I like the Billy the kid story and I've seen many movies about him but this is the best one for 3 reasons. 1: I liked that they started from the beginning, other films focus on the "later" years when he met Pat Garret. 2: I like that this is more about the gang and not just about Billy. 3: Emilio Estevez is the best Billy the kid. I think the story is very well done, it's the best depiction of the Lincoln county war in New Mexico and the changes made were for the better. Like in real life John Tunstall was only twenty something and their were about a dozen or so "regulaters" not just the 6 shown here but the changes made worked for the better. The film is well directed by Chris Cain with a great balance of action, humor and is appropriately violent. I also like the look of the film, it really makes you feel like their in the wild west during 1878 and not on some sound stage. It also has a great cast! With the great Terrance Stamp who's perfectly cast as John Tunstall, an older English man who takes in six young rebellious men to work at his cattle ranch. The villain is the always great Jack Palance as Murphy, who kills Tunstal, starting the war. The 6 young boys search for justice so they become sheriffs but thanks to Billy killing everyone who they're supposed to arrest, they become outlaws. I LOVE Emillio Estevez as Billy the Kid. I know many would say his interpretation is not historically accurate but I think it's much more the way we would like to imagine the kid. Emillio gives one of his best performances and he was cheated out of an Oscar nomination. I think they did a great job in blending a lot of color to the kid. Billy is a lot of things in this movie, he's cocky, rebellious, trigger-happy, a little crazy, a loyal friend, and charming. Billy is perfectly portrayed as an anti-hero like he should be. Emillio always makes him likable even if we know he's a little crazy. I do like how they make Billy a little crazy as he takes pleasure in killing his enemies. His kills are marked by his unforgettable giggle, I love Emillio's lunatic sounding laugh. Billy is fearless who enjoys the thrill of life or death situations. But despite his wild behavior he's extremely loyal to his friends which gives him a lot of heart. Kiefer Sutherland is great as the more sensitive "Doc", one of my favorite performances of his. I love Lou Diamond Phillips as Chavez Y Chavez, possibly his best role and I love his knife skills. Dermot Mulloney is great as "dirty" Steve and he has a lot of funny moments. Casey Siemasko is great as Charlie, the more scared one of the bunch. I love Charlie Sheen as Dick, the appointed leader of the gang. I like how he fought for leadership of the regulators with his real life brother Emillio as Billy. I like the name of the gang as "the regulators", that's a cool name. The film has non stop action, good humor, good characters and the theme of friendship works well here.I love the rock'n'roll theme music. I like that they show Emillio/Billy take the now famous Billy the kid picture as well. One of my favorite movies of all-time.

    At the end of the movie, Billy and his gang are holed up in the house of their lawyer which is completely surrounded by hundreds of lawmen, bounty hunters, and the U.S Army. Even Doc says "Billy we're good, but this is getting ridiculous.". After the house is set on fire, Chavez escapes and somehow sneaks right past the men outside. Billy and his gang exit the house guns a blazin' right in front of a Gatling gun the Army has brought which mysteriously is not used. Chavez rides back with 3 horses, rides right through the men outside, jumps the horses over a barricade, and Billy and Doc somehow manage to mount the horses and ride right through the men down the street with not one shot fired. Then to top it all off, the lawyer emerges from the house and the Army pumps about 100 bullets into him with the same Gatling gun that for some reason they didn't use on Billy and his gang. It gets better, Billy then rides back, stops in the middle of the street, pops a cap into Murphy, and then rides off with no shots fired at him. Of course the gang then just rides off into the sunset, why would the US Army bother to pursue? This was a ridiculous, unbelievable ending and completely ruined the entire movie.

    I will firstly admit that I did not pay the fullest attention to this film while it was on, but I did understand everything going on, and I knew it was going to bit of an average film anyway, but still one I was interested in because of the all-star cast, from director Christopher Cain (The Next Karate Kid). Basically, set in 1878 in New Mexico, young gun men are picked up on the road by John Tunstall (Terence Stamp) to work on his ranch, but they also learn to read and be civilised, but competitive cattle seller and rich rancher Lawrence G. Murphy (Jack Palance) is hanging around and acting suspiciously. Tunstall is shot by Murphy's men during a scuffle, because Sheriff Brady (Daniel 'Danny' Kamin) is one of the gang Justice Wilson (Victor Izay) can't do anything about the situation, but attorney Alex McSween (Lost's Terry O'Quinn) persuades him to recruit the young men as deputies and give them the warrants to arrest the murderers. The young men: William H. Bonney (Emilio Estevez), who later becomes the infamous 'Billy the Kid', Josiah Gordon 'Doc' Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland), 'Jose' Chavez y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips), Richard 'Dick' Brewer (Charlie Sheen), Dirty Steve Stephens (Dermot Mulroney) and Charles 'Charley' Bowdre (Casey Siemaszko), do not intend to arrest the killers though, they just want to shoot them. After Dick and one of the others is killed the five remaining young gun men have the final showdown with Murphy and his gang, and Billy of course went on to become an outlaw and was eventually shot dead by Patrick Floyd 'Pat' Garrett (Patrick Wayne). Also starring Sharon Thomas Cain as Susan McSween, Brian Keith as Buckshot Roberts and Cody Palance, Jack's son as Baker. The cast all do their parts fine, especially Esteves in the leading role of the well known gunslinger, I may not have followed the story in full, but the action sequences are good to watch with all the guns firing and some blood, a not bad western. Worth watching!

    Young Guns is directed by Christopher Cain and written by John Fusco. It stars Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney, Casey Siemaszko, Terry O'Quinn, Jack Palance and Terence Stamp. Music is by Brian Banks and Anthony Marinelli and cinematography is by Dean Semler. Film is a telling of Billy the Kid's part in the Lincoln County War in New Mexico 1878. Plot sees the murder of John Tunstall send Billy and the rest of the Tunstall Regulators on a mission to avenge his murder. It ain't easy having pals. Often derided by Western movie purists as a sort of MTV Western made to showcase the various talents of the then Hollywood Brat Pack of Estevez, Sheen, Sutherland et al, Young Guns is actually a far more entertaining picture than some critical assessments suggest it is. It also has some rock solid Western history footings holding it up, yes it's far from accurate in various scenarios, age of characters and numbers in gangs etc, but the core story of the Lincoln County War is there. A massive success at the box office and spawning an equally successful sequel in 1990, Young Guns zips along at pace, contains high energy action sequences and provides plenty of quotable dialogue. Best of all, though, it doesn't take itself seriously, it wants to be a rooting-tooting Western of fun endeavours, if viewed on those terms it's an absolute winner, especially since the cast are playing it that way. Alex, if you stay they're gonna kill you. And then I'm gonna have to go around and kill all the guys who killed you. That's a lot of killing. Estevez is terrific as The Kid, blending boyish arrogance with fearless rage, a fun and scary character who is easy to get on the saddle with. Elsewhere it's a mixed bag, but apart from the disappointing Sheen, the casting decisions sit well and if you talk to ten different Young Guns fans you will most likely get a number of different answers come back as to who is their favourite Regulator (mine is Dirty Steve played by Mulroney if you are wondering?). O'Quinn is spot on as Alex McSween, Stamp adds classical tones to the ill fated John Tunstall and Palance is a neat fit as villain Lawrence Murphy. Nice to see Brian Keith get a cameo as a larger than life bounty hunter as well. Semler's photography and Cain's filming techniques are a bit too anachronistic at times and the Banks/Marinelli score too modern an accompaniment on occasions. But film rounds out as a nifty bit of Oater play for Gen X and showed that as the 1990s approached there was still love for this greatest of genres. 7.5/10

    Really good story on the rise of Billy the Kid and his fellow cohorts. The historical accuracy of the movie probably isn't perfect but if you're not looking for a history channel version of his story then the story is perfectly fine and still hits on a lot of the major points in Billy the Kid and his problems with the Murphy gang. The cast consists of a who's who of young actors in the late '80s with Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips. If you're looking for a fun western then this is a movie for you. Good shootout scenes and Estevez plays the role of his career as Billy. Much better done then any other movie about Billy's life.

    and the result was this abomination of a movie and butchering of history. Anyone who doesn't think this movie is drek should watch a real western, "The Unforgiven" or "Tombstone" or even "The Searchers" with John Wayne. This movie is just Charlie and Emilio and their buddies getting paid to ride horses, wear cool clothes, and play with guns. Avoid it like the plague, along with the sequel (why???) and their other terrible outing, "The Three Musketeers" otherwise known as; the Brat Pack wanted to wear more cool costumes, play with swords and get paid for it. They're even less believable as Musketeers than they are as gunfighters.

    For images and story. For music and subtle details of a interior war. For the science to make nuances in perfect place. For Martijn Lakemeier play and for the end - crush of spell. In fact, for the art to describe a war as mixture of trust, friendship, courage and measure of truth in the eyes of a boy. Limits and force of gestures. Hope and power of small pieces of day. Sacrifice as way to be and snow like cell of shadows. And love - sketch of real values. It is difficult to say more. May be movie of a self definition or only fragment by a historical event. Few hours of a hero or circle of resistance. For every person - a slice. From a poem.

    This movie is watchable. The best performing actor by a mile is Jack Palance, making much out of a shallow character. From the younger bunch (Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Casey Siemaszko, Dermut Mulroney and Emilio Estevez) only the last one is worth mentioning as rather decent. The plot is predictable all the way even if you are not very familiar with Billy the Kid. Talking history, don't expect to pick up anything from history. Movies are not the best place to learn history and this one doesn't make an exception. The soundtrack is not very exciting either. So what make it watchable ? The settings are really quality. In every scene you can feel a bit of that dust and the desert-like weather. And the action. If you take some of your precious time to spend on "Young Guns", you are not looking for some mind-boggling drama, are you ? There are many sequences of shooting, bloodshed, revenge and quarry. That's the best of it. If you consider yourself thin-skinned, don't even bother to watch. Apart from some nonsensical dialogs, a dislocated speech here and there to give you some "history", it boils down to guns going off. And it won't let you down in this very aspect. The accents are another annoyance. But what disappoints immensely is Charlie Sheen, whose awfulness kills his character into the first 30 minutes. It is a blessing. And his movie career didn't actually take off. Go figure ! 5 out of 10

    It seems that the 80's were so flooded by the "Star Wars" and "Rocky" films, by Steven Spielberg's "Indiana Jones" and so many other blockbusters such as "Top Gun" or "Terminator" that it didn't leave much room for some little gems like "Biloxi Blues" or "Barfly" or let's say for the Western genre, "Young Guns"  one of my favorite westerns ever. Maybe, I'm using 'one of' as an understatement, as if I was ashamed to say 'm favorite', but I am not, I just gained some maturity, I saw more westerns since the day I discovered "Young Guns", and I can understand why this movie didn't get much acclaim, especially if you consider the period, the 80's, when Eastwood the director was reconquering the genre, and through "Pale Rider" prepared the audience to a darker form of revisionist westerns. "Young Guns" with its youthful cast introduced by one my all-time favorite intros: Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Casey Siemaczko and Dermot Mulroney, looks closer to the typical 80's film marketed for teenage audiences than a mature film meant to be taken seriously, on the surface only  because if you watch it, and decide to appreciate the film regardless of your personal tastes  well, I defy anyone not to be captivated by theses 100 minutes of pure entertainment. Yes, even the dark "Pale Rider" pales in comparison with "Young Guns", because the latter doesn't overdo the archetypes of the genre, it has its load of thrills, of chases, shootouts, parties, romances, discussions BUT with something more that lacks even in the most acclaimed masterpieces of the genre : it has characters, a wonderful gallery of characters, who carry their personalities less than stereotypes than true human flows, with their motives, actions and reactions, and within the plot of the film, there are different arcs involving each of these characters, handled with such a confidence, that nothing ever feels forced or clich&eacute;, and at the end, each of them would ultimately change, making "Young Guns" more than a Western but also a sort of coming-of-age story, a genre cherished during the 80's. And of course, the biggest change will concern the leader of the bunch who'll become one of the most defining legends of the Old West. As a kid, I grew up reading "The Adventures of Lucky Luke", a Franco-Belgian comic book set in the Old West, needless to say that I loved it so much, I was familiar with Billy the Kid, the stagecoaches, Jesse James, Calamity Jane, the Conquest of the West before I reached my tenth year, so I discovered "Young Guns" at the age of 13, with enough knowledge of the Old West to appreciate it and not enough of cinematic westerns to judge it impartially. And I'll never forget that night, when I saw it with my father, I didn't care much about the story until that young blondish guy introduced himself by "William Bonney" and the other said "Pat Garrett", I told my dad, "hey, it's Billy the Kid, and this is the guy who'll kill him" The movie took a whole new direction for me and it immediately grabbed my interest. And the rest didn't disappoint me. "Young Guns" is a movie whose rooting process is slow but efficient, you definitely get into the story when the tutor, John Tunstall, remarkably played by Terrence Stamp, is killed by men who belongs to the cattle owner and biggest competitor, the evil Murphy, Jack Palance whose evil smirk hasn't lost its touch either. Then, the 'young guns' are mandated as 'regulators' to arrest the killers, then it all gets wrong when Billy, the previously underestimated newcomer makes this business personal. He makes himself an enemy through Dick, Charlie Sheen, the straight man of the bunch, who'll get killed as if fate wanted another kind of leader, and progressively, as blood is shed and guns are fired, we get into the others, Doc, Kiefer Sutherland as the poet in love with a little Chinese girl sold to Murphy for a dirty shirt, Chavez, Philips as the only surviving of a Navajo tribe killed by Murphy's men with the army as accomplice, and of course, his 'friend', the scene-stealing tobacco-chewing "Dirty" Steve. But the one who touched my heart the most was Simeaczko as Charley Bowder, the nicest and most friendly (also cowardly) of the bunch. It was a nice touch for the story to have a character who doesn't react as a coldblooded killer but feels sick from the simple thought that he might be hanged, and his evolution is also one of the most rewarding aspects of the film, as I never fail to have goose bumps in the scene where he finally overcomes his fear and start getting into the shootout that concludes the film. And talking of the shootout, it's certainly one of my all-time favorite climactic sequences because I never saw the way it started coming and the amount of thrills is so great that at the end, me and my Dad, sorry, my Dad and me  could only wow, and I knew I had just watched one of the greatest films ever. Yes, "Young Guns" became one of my all-time favorite films because of so many things, the extraordinary performance of Emilio Estevez, the difference between the characters and my rooting for each of them, the amazing shootout, the coming-of-age story and beyond everything, the emotional core of the film: a great message about solidarity and friendship, as mentioned by the concluding line of the film : "Pals", before followed by one hell of an amazing soundtrack. So say what you want, it may not be the best Western ever made, it didn't get any Oscar nominations, but for some reason, it will forever have a special place in my heart.

Music is by Brian Banks and Anthony Marinelli and cinematography is by Dean Semler. Film is a telling of Billy the Kid's part in the Lincoln County War in New Mexico 1878. Plot sees the murder of John Tunstall send Billy and the rest of the Tunstall Regulators on a mission to avenge his murder. It ain't easy having pals. Often derided by Western movie purists as a sort of MTV Western made to showcase the various talents of the then Hollywood Brat Pack of Estevez, Sheen, Sutherland et al, Young Guns is actually a far more entertaining picture than some critical assessments suggest it is. It also has some rock solid Western history footings holding it up, yes it's far from accurate in various scenarios, age of characters and numbers in gangs etc, but the core story of the Lincoln County War is there. A massive success at the box office and spawning an equally successful sequel in 1990, Young Guns zips along at pace, contains high energy action sequences and provides plenty of quotable dialogue. Best of all, though, it doesn't take itself seriously, it wants to be a rooting-tooting Western of fun endeavours, if viewed on those terms it's an absolute winner, especially since the cast are playing it that way. Alex, if you stay they're gonna kill you. And then I'm gonna have to go around and kill all the guys who killed you. That's a lot of killing. Estevez is terrific as The Kid, blending boyish arrogance with fearless rage, a fun and scary character who is easy to get on the saddle with. Elsewhere it's a mixed bag, but apart from the disappointing Sheen, the casting decisions sit well and if you talk to ten different Young Guns fans you will most likely get a number of different answers come back as to who is their favourite Regulator (mine is Dirty Steve played by Mulroney if you are wondering?). O'Quinn is spot on as Alex McSween, Stamp adds classical tones to the ill fated John Tunstall and Palance is a neat fit as villain Lawrence Murphy. Nice to see Brian Keith get a cameo as a larger than life bounty hunter as well. Semler's photography and Cain's filming techniques are a bit too anachronistic at times and the Banks/Marinelli score too modern an accompaniment on occasions. But film rounds out as a nifty bit of Oater play for Gen X and showed that as the 1990s approached there was still love for this greatest of genres. 7.5/10

    Really good story on the rise of Billy the Kid and his fellow cohorts. The historical accuracy of the movie probably isn't perfect but if you're not looking for a history channel version of his story then the story is perfectly fine and still hits on a lot of the major points in Billy the Kid and his problems with the Murphy gang. The cast consists of a who's who of young actors in the late '80s with Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips. If you're looking for a fun western then this is a movie for you. Good shootout scenes and Estevez plays the role of his career as Billy. Much better done then any other movie about Billy's life.

    and the result was this abomination of a movie and butchering of history. Anyone who doesn't think this movie is drek should watch a real western, "The Unforgiven" or "Tombstone" or even "The Searchers" with John Wayne. This movie is just Charlie and Emilio and their buddies getting paid to ride horses, wear cool clothes, and play with guns. Avoid it like the plague, along with the sequel (why???) and their other terrible outing, "The Three Musketeers" otherwise known as; the Brat Pack wanted to wear more cool costumes, play with swords and get paid for it. They're even less believable as Musketeers than they are as gunfighters.

    This movie is watchable. The best performing actor by a mile is Jack Palance, making much out of a shallow character. From the younger bunch (Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Casey Siemaszko, Dermut Mulroney and Emilio Estevez) only the last one is worth mentioning as rather decent. The plot is predictable all the way even if you are not very familiar with Billy the Kid. Talking history, don't expect to pick up anything from history. Movies are not the best place to learn history and this one doesn't make an exception. The soundtrack is not very exciting either. So what make it watchable ? The settings are really quality. In every scene you can feel a bit of that dust and the desert-like weather. And the action. If you take some of your precious time to spend on "Young Guns", you are not looking for some mind-boggling drama, are you ? There are many sequences of shooting, bloodshed, revenge and quarry. That's the best of it. If you consider yourself thin-skinned, don't even bother to watch. Apart from some nonsensical dialogs, a dislocated speech here and there to give you some "history", it boils down to guns going off. And it won't let you down in this very aspect. The accents are another annoyance. But what disappoints immensely is Charlie Sheen, whose awfulness kills his character into the first 30 minutes. It is a blessing. And his movie career didn't actually take off. Go figure ! 5 out of 10

    It seems that the 80's were so flooded by the "Star Wars" and "Rocky" films, by Steven Spielberg's "Indiana Jones" and so many other blockbusters such as "Top Gun" or "Terminator" that it didn't leave much room for some little gems like "Biloxi Blues" or "Barfly" or let's say for the Western genre, "Young Guns"  one of my favorite westerns ever. Maybe, I'm using 'one of' as an understatement, as if I was ashamed to say 'm favorite', but I am not, I just gained some maturity, I saw more westerns since the day I discovered "Young Guns", and I can understand why this movie didn't get much acclaim, especially if you consider the period, the 80's, when Eastwood the director was reconquering the genre, and through "Pale Rider" prepared the audience to a darker form of revisionist westerns. "Young Guns" with its youthful cast introduced by one my all-time favorite intros: Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Casey Siemaczko and Dermot Mulroney, looks closer to the typical 80's film marketed for teenage audiences than a mature film meant to be taken seriously, on the surface only  because if you watch it, and decide to appreciate the film regardless of your personal tastes  well, I defy anyone not to be captivated by theses 100 minutes of pure entertainment. Yes, even the dark "Pale Rider" pales in comparison with "Young Guns", because the latter doesn't overdo the archetypes of the genre, it has its load of thrills, of chases, shootouts, parties, romances, discussions BUT with something more that lacks even in the most acclaimed masterpieces of the genre : it has characters, a wonderful gallery of characters, who carry their personalities less than stereotypes than true human flows, with their motives, actions and reactions, and within the plot of the film, there are different arcs involving each of these characters, handled with such a confidence, that nothing ever feels forced or clich&eacute;, and at the end, each of them would ultimately change, making "Young Guns" more than a Western but also a sort of coming-of-age story, a genre cherished during the 80's. And of course, the biggest change will concern the leader of the bunch who'll become one of the most defining legends of the Old West. As a kid, I grew up reading "The Adventures of Lucky Luke", a Franco-Belgian comic book set in the Old West, needless to say that I loved it so much, I was familiar with Billy the Kid, the stagecoaches, Jesse James, Calamity Jane, the Conquest of the West before I reached my tenth year, so I discovered "Young Guns" at the age of 13, with enough knowledge of the Old West to appreciate it and not enough of cinematic westerns to judge it impartially. And I'll never forget that night, when I saw it with my father, I didn't care much about the story until that young blondish guy introduced himself by "William Bonney" and the other said "Pat Garrett", I told my dad, "hey, it's Billy the Kid, and this is the guy who'll kill him" The movie took a whole new direction for me and it immediately grabbed my interest. And the rest didn't disappoint me. "Young Guns" is a movie whose rooting process is slow but efficient, you definitely get into the story when the tutor, John Tunstall, remarkably played by Terrence Stamp, is killed by men who belongs to the cattle owner and biggest competitor, the evil Murphy, Jack Palance whose evil smirk hasn't lost its touch either. Then, the 'young guns' are mandated as 'regulators' to arrest the killers, then it all gets wrong when Billy, the previously underestimated newcomer makes this business personal. He makes himself an enemy through Dick, Charlie Sheen, the straight man of the bunch, who'll get killed as if fate wanted another kind of leader, and progressively, as blood is shed and guns are fired, we get into the others, Doc, Kiefer Sutherland as the poet in love with a little Chinese girl sold to Murphy for a dirty shirt, Chavez, Philips as the only surviving of a Navajo tribe killed by Murphy's men with the army as accomplice, and of course, his 'friend', the scene-stealing tobacco-chewing "Dirty" Steve. But the one who touched my heart the most was Simeaczko as Charley Bowder, the nicest and most friendly (also cowardly) of the bunch. It was a nice touch for the story to have a character who doesn't react as a coldblooded killer but feels sick from the simple thought that he might be hanged, and his evolution is also one of the most rewarding aspects of the film, as I never fail to have goose bumps in the scene where he finally overcomes his fear and start getting into the shootout that concludes the film. And talking of the shootout, it's certainly one of my all-time favorite climactic sequences because I never saw the way it started coming and the amount of thrills is so great that at the end, me and my Dad, sorry, my Dad and me  could only wow, and I knew I had just watched one of the greatest films ever. Yes, "Young Guns" became one of my all-time favorite films because of so many things, the extraordinary performance of Emilio Estevez, the difference between the characters and my rooting for each of them, the amazing shootout, the coming-of-age story and beyond everything, the emotional core of the film: a great message about solidarity and friendship, as mentioned by the concluding line of the film : "Pals", before followed by one hell of an amazing soundtrack. So say what you want, it may not be the best Western ever made, it didn't get any Oscar nominations, but for some reason, it will forever have a special place in my heart.

    Young Guns tells the story of 'Billy the Kid' one more time, and after seeing so many versions of the same story, you can not help comparing, but with good results. Emilio Estevez is very good as Billy, and also Kiefer Sutherland and Charlie Sheen as his friends.Young Guns suffers from the fact that the action scenes are kind of confusing, because of the camera work that tries to be original. You see a lot of close ups where long distance views would be more clarifying. There is a good scene where they shoot at Buckshot Roberts, and also great moments when Billy shows a sense of humor. The relationships in the group, at the beginning when Charlie Sheen is the leader and how Estevez begins to take his place are also well presented. The Irish Jack Palance fighting the English Terence Stamp makes a good point of how they brought their troubles home to the west. Basically this film is a celebration of the young promising actors, playing with guns.It makes you think of an 'Ocean's Eleven' of the West.

    I have not seen a lot of westerns so I don't pretend to be some expert on western movies. However this is without a doubt one of the best westerns of all-time and my favorite western of all-time. I know some people criticize this film for not being historically accurate or a shallow attempt to be a "hip" western. Well, the truth is this film is not 100% accurate with history but what movie is? I liked the idea of this being a hip western staring Hollywood's "brat pack" with rock music playing in the background. I think it fits because this is basically a story about Billy the kid, a outlaw who was under 20 years old so it makes sense to give this one a younger or hipper feel to it. I like the Billy the kid story and I've seen many movies about him but this is the best one for 3 reasons. 1: I liked that they started from the beginning, other films focus on the "later" years when he met Pat Garret. 2: I like that this is more about the gang and not just about Billy. 3: Emilio Estevez is the best Billy the kid. I think the story is very well done, it's the best depiction of the Lincoln county war in New Mexico and the changes made were for the better. Like in real life John Tunstall was only twenty something and their were about a dozen or so "regulaters" not just the 6 shown here but the changes made worked for the better. The film is well directed by Chris Cain with a great balance of action, humor and is appropriately violent. I also like the look of the film, it really makes you feel like their in the wild west during 1878 and not on some sound stage. It also has a great cast! With the great Terrance Stamp who's perfectly cast as John Tunstall, an older English man who takes in six young rebellious men to work at his cattle ranch. The villain is the always great Jack Palance as Murphy, who kills Tunstal, starting the war. The 6 young boys search for justice so they become sheriffs but thanks to Billy killing everyone who they're supposed to arrest, they become outlaws. I LOVE Emillio Estevez as Billy the Kid. I know many would say his interpretation is not historically accurate but I think it's much more the way we would like to imagine the kid. Emillio gives one of his best performances and he was cheated out of an Oscar nomination. I think they did a great job in blending a lot of color to the kid. Billy is a lot of things in this movie, he's cocky, rebellious, trigger-happy, a little crazy, a loyal friend, and charming. Billy is perfectly portrayed as an anti-hero like he should be. Emillio always makes him likable even if we know he's a little crazy. I do like how they make Billy a little crazy as he takes pleasure in killing his enemies. His kills are marked by his unforgettable giggle, I love Emillio's lunatic sounding laugh. Billy is fearless who enjoys the thrill of life or death situations. But despite his wild behavior he's extremely loyal to his friends which gives him a lot of heart. Kiefer Sutherland is great as the more sensitive "Doc", one of my favorite performances of his. I love Lou Diamond Phillips as Chavez Y Chavez, possibly his best role and I love his knife skills. Dermot Mulloney is great as "dirty" Steve and he has a lot of funny moments. Casey Siemasko is great as Charlie, the more scared one of the bunch. I love Charlie Sheen as Dick, the appointed leader of the gang. I like how he fought for leadership of the regulators with his real life brother Emillio as Billy. I like the name of the gang as "the regulators", that's a cool name. The film has non stop action, good humor, good characters and the theme of friendship works well here.I love the rock'n'roll theme music. I like that they show Emillio/Billy take the now famous Billy the kid picture as well. One of my favorite movies of all-time.

    At the end of the movie, Billy and his gang are holed up in the house of their lawyer which is completely surrounded by hundreds of lawmen, bounty hunters, and the U.S Army. Even Doc says "Billy we're good, but this is getting ridiculous.". After the house is set on fire, Chavez escapes and somehow sneaks right past the men outside. Billy and his gang exit the house guns a blazin' right in front of a Gatling gun the Army has brought which mysteriously is not used. Chavez rides back with 3 horses, rides right through the men outside, jumps the horses over a barricade, and Billy and Doc somehow manage to mount the horses and ride right through the men down the street with not one shot fired. Then to top it all off, the lawyer emerges from the house and the Army pumps about 100 bullets into him with the same Gatling gun that for some reason they didn't use on Billy and his gang. It gets better, Billy then rides back, stops in the middle of the street, pops a cap into Murphy, and then rides off with no shots fired at him. Of course the gang then just rides off into the sunset, why would the US Army bother to pursue? This was a ridiculous, unbelievable ending and completely ruined the entire movie.

    I will firstly admit that I did not pay the fullest attention to this film while it was on, but I did understand everything going on, and I knew it was going to bit of an average film anyway, but still one I was interested in because of the all-star cast, from director Christopher Cain (The Next Karate Kid). Basically, set in 1878 in New Mexico, young gun men are picked up on the road by John Tunstall (Terence Stamp) to work on his ranch, but they also learn to read and be civilised, but competitive cattle seller and rich rancher Lawrence G. Murphy (Jack Palance) is hanging around and acting suspiciously. Tunstall is shot by Murphy's men during a scuffle, because Sheriff Brady (Daniel 'Danny' Kamin) is one of the gang Justice Wilson (Victor Izay) can't do anything about the situation, but attorney Alex McSween (Lost's Terry O'Quinn) persuades him to recruit the young men as deputies and give them the warrants to arrest the murderers. The young men: William H. Bonney (Emilio Estevez), who later becomes the infamous 'Billy the Kid', Josiah Gordon 'Doc' Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland), 'Jose' Chavez y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips), Richard 'Dick' Brewer (Charlie Sheen), Dirty Steve Stephens (Dermot Mulroney) and Charles 'Charley' Bowdre (Casey Siemaszko), do not intend to arrest the killers though, they just want to shoot them. After Dick and one of the others is killed the five remaining young gun men have the final showdown with Murphy and his gang, and Billy of course went on to become an outlaw and was eventually shot dead by Patrick Floyd 'Pat' Garrett (Patrick Wayne). Also starring Sharon Thomas Cain as Susan McSween, Brian Keith as Buckshot Roberts and Cody Palance, Jack's son as Baker. The cast all do their parts fine, especially Esteves in the leading role of the well known gunslinger, I may not have followed the story in full, but the action sequences are good to watch with all the guns firing and some blood, a not bad western. Worth watching!

    It seems that the 80's were so flooded by the "Star Wars" and "Rocky" films, by Steven Spielberg's "Indiana Jones" and so many other blockbusters such as "Top Gun" or "Terminator" that it didn't leave much room for some little gems like "Biloxi Blues" or "Barfly" or let's say for the Western genre, "Young Guns"  one of my favorite westerns ever.

Yes, even the dark "Pale Rider" pales in comparison with "Young Guns", because the latter doesn't overdo the archetypes of the genre, it has its load of thrills, of chases, shootouts, parties, romances, discussions BUT with something more that lacks even in the most acclaimed masterpieces of the genre : it has characters, a wonderful gallery of characters, who carry their personalities less than stereotypes than true human flows, with their motives, actions and reactions, and within the plot of the film, there are different arcs involving each of these characters, handled with such a confidence, that nothing ever feels forced or clich&eacute;, and at the end, each of them would ultimately change, making "Young Guns" more than a Western but also a sort of coming-of-age story, a genre cherished during the 80's. And of course, the biggest change will concern the leader of the bunch who'll become one of the most defining legends of the Old West. As a kid, I grew up reading "The Adventures of Lucky Luke", a Franco-Belgian comic book set in the Old West, needless to say that I loved it so much, I was familiar with Billy the Kid, the stagecoaches, Jesse James, Calamity Jane, the Conquest of the West before I reached my tenth year, so I discovered "Young Guns" at the age of 13, with enough knowledge of the Old West to appreciate it and not enough of cinematic westerns to judge it impartially. And I'll never forget that night, when I saw it with my father, I didn't care much about the story until that young blondish guy introduced himself by "William Bonney" and the other said "Pat Garrett", I told my dad, "hey, it's Billy the Kid, and this is the guy who'll kill him" The movie took a whole new direction for me and it immediately grabbed my interest. And the rest didn't disappoint me. "Young Guns" is a movie whose rooting process is slow but efficient, you definitely get into the story when the tutor, John Tunstall, remarkably played by Terrence Stamp, is killed by men who belongs to the cattle owner and biggest competitor, the evil Murphy, Jack Palance whose evil smirk hasn't lost its touch either. Then, the 'young guns' are mandated as 'regulators' to arrest the killers, then it all gets wrong when Billy, the previously underestimated newcomer makes this business personal. He makes himself an enemy through Dick, Charlie Sheen, the straight man of the bunch, who'll get killed as if fate wanted another kind of leader, and progressively, as blood is shed and guns are fired, we get into the others, Doc, Kiefer Sutherland as the poet in love with a little Chinese girl sold to Murphy for a dirty shirt, Chavez, Philips as the only surviving of a Navajo tribe killed by Murphy's men with the army as accomplice, and of course, his 'friend', the scene-stealing tobacco-chewing "Dirty" Steve. But the one who touched my heart the most was Simeaczko as Charley Bowder, the nicest and most friendly (also cowardly) of the bunch. It was a nice touch for the story to have a character who doesn't react as a coldblooded killer but feels sick from the simple thought that he might be hanged, and his evolution is also one of the most rewarding aspects of the film, as I never fail to have goose bumps in the scene where he finally overcomes his fear and start getting into the shootout that concludes the film. And talking of the shootout, it's certainly one of my all-time favorite climactic sequences because I never saw the way it started coming and the amount of thrills is so great that at the end, me and my Dad, sorry, my Dad and me  could only wow, and I knew I had just watched one of the greatest films ever. Yes, "Young Guns" became one of my all-time favorite films because of so many things, the extraordinary performance of Emilio Estevez, the difference between the characters and my rooting for each of them, the amazing shootout, the coming-of-age story and beyond everything, the emotional core of the film: a great message about solidarity and friendship, as mentioned by the concluding line of the film : "Pals", before followed by one hell of an amazing soundtrack. So say what you want, it may not be the best Western ever made, it didn't get any Oscar nominations, but for some reason, it will forever have a special place in my heart.

    Young Guns tells the story of 'Billy the Kid' one more time, and after seeing so many versions of the same story, you can not help comparing, but with good results. Emilio Estevez is very good as Billy, and also Kiefer Sutherland and Charlie Sheen as his friends.Young Guns suffers from the fact that the action scenes are kind of confusing, because of the camera work that tries to be original. You see a lot of close ups where long distance views would be more clarifying. There is a good scene where they shoot at Buckshot Roberts, and also great moments when Billy shows a sense of humor. The relationships in the group, at the beginning when Charlie Sheen is the leader and how Estevez begins to take his place are also well presented. The Irish Jack Palance fighting the English Terence Stamp makes a good point of how they brought their troubles home to the west. Basically this film is a celebration of the young promising actors, playing with guns.It makes you think of an 'Ocean's Eleven' of the West.
