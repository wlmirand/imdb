    Thriller with supercharged action and moving pacing by Renny Harlin . Gripping , splendid action movie with the great Bruce Willis desperately trying to find the means avoid his wife to be crashed . This mindless, interesting and ingenious film is packed with thrills , suspense , tension and lots of interminable action . Again John McClane, officer of the NYPD and hero of the Nakatomi Hostage Crisis, attempts to avert disaster as rogue military officials seize control of Dulles International Airport in Washington . Once again he is in the wrong place at the wrong time , as some criminals led by rebel Col. Stuart (William Sadler) wish to free a drug baron (Franco Nero , this role is a reference to the real-life Panamanian general, Manuel Noriega, who was overthrown for brutality and drug trafficking in Panama in the 1980s and being turned over to the US government) . An army of killers want to free a known South American general being extradited to America for trial , but they have only one little problem: John McClane (Bruce Willis). This second part also contains noisy action , thrills , explosions , plot twists , and lots of fun . Good sequel that follows a similar style , humor and action . From the start to finish the action packed is unstopped and spectacular . Exciting screenplay that dispenses absurd excitement as well as amusement . Excellent thriller full of intrigue and tense, this is a fast-paced, stylized action-suspense film . The tension of this picture keeps snowballing as the clock ticks ever close for a groundbreaking as well as impressive final . As always , Bruce Willis is very fine as hilarious , sarcastic and intrepid cop . Secondary casting is frankly well , such as Franco Nero , William Atherton , Dennis Franz , Fred Dalton Thomson , Reginald VelJohnson , John Amos , Tom Bower , Sheila McCarthy , Don Harvey , a brief acting by John Leguizano and Robert Patick ; furthermore , William Sadler steals the show and takes honors as psychopath who attempts to turn the tables on the protagonist . Adequate and thrilling musical score accompanying the action by Michael Kamen . Inventively photographed by Oliver Wood ; most of the interior airport scenes were filmed in the Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International airport . In addition , some of the shots of the airport were filmed at the old Stapleton Airport in Denver, Colorado. This big-budgeted motion picture was lavishly produced by Lawrence Binder and Joel Silver , being well directed by Renny Harlin . Renny edited this film and The adventures of Ford Fairlane at the same time because of the relatively short post-production period for both films and were then released one month apart . John McTiernan who directed &uml;Die Hard&uml; had planned to direct this film, but could not because of his commitment to directing Hunt for Red October . Renny Harlin is an expert on action genre such as &uml; Cliffhunger&uml; , &uml;Deep blue sea&uml; , &uml;Driven&uml; , &uml;Long kiss goodnight&uml; , &uml;12 rounds&uml; and many others . Rating : Better than average thriller movie . The picture will appeal to frenetic action buffs and Bruce Willis fans .

    Sure it may be basically the first movie in an airport, and sure it may just be trying to catch lightning in a bottle a second time, but that doesn't mean Die Hard 2 isn't enjoyable. It's still a lot of fun from start to finish. John McClane is still a likable a**hole and although the villain isn't on par with Hans Gruber, he's still an okay villain. Nothing too special but still has all the requirements. The action is still tons of fun, especially the plane crashes. My favorite scene is probably the scene when John attempts to help a commercial jet land after the terrorist leader has shut off the lights on the runway, but fails and the plane crashes anyway, and John just sits on the stairs in the next shot broken and teary-eyed. This shows that John is still a human being that cared for all the lives he failed to save. Every man woman and child. Despite its flaws, Die Hard 2 is still a fun action movie that still delivers the goods. 8/10

    *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I don't understand the complains about "Die hard 2 : Die harder" . The first movie was almost a perfect action movie . It was obvious that sequel will be weaker , yet "Die hard 2" is a very satisfying sequel . It follows the formula that worked so well the first time : one hero - one place - many terrorists , wife in danger , nobody listens to him except a black guy and everything happens during Christmas . There is not a bit of new idea here . The only change is the new director  Renny Harlin , who took over John McTiernan (who was busy with "The hunt for Red October") . Harlin is a solid craftsman and he directs the movie professionally. The screenplay was once again written by Steven Souza and with a help from Doug Richardson. I'm amazed by the complains about the violence and swearing . Look people , this is R rated movie . If you can't stand the heat , stay out of kitchen. Maybe people who are obsessed with political correctness forgot about it , but in REAL LIFE people swear . A lot. And there isn't a single scene of unnecessary violence here . When you're fighting for life you don't exactly have time for subtlety. If you're looking for mindless violence watch one of those stupid "Saw" movies. And for god's sake there is no plot hole with the planes . You want to know why the airplanes didn't tried to land on other airports ? Because they had too little fuel and the weather was too bad. So , they had to stay in the air. What I liked ? Bruce Willis is back as the wise cracking John McClane . So is Bonnie Bedelia as his wife. Reginald Veljohnson appears in a small episode as Al Powell. There are one dimensional , but fun characters : John Amos as the idiotic chef of airport security Carmine Lorenzo and Tom Bover as Marvin the wacky janitor. Souza has a sense of humor and there is a plenty of moments to laugh . The action scenes directed by Harlin are exciting and fun. The screenplay offers also some nice twists. What I didn't liked ? I could live without the naked tai chi . There is one scene with the grenades that makes my head hurt. Those have to be the slowest grenades in the movie history. I don't understand why the airport crew cooperated with the terrorists , even after the terrorists lost their equipment and couldn't blackmail the airport anymore. Also , the movie lacks a really good main villain compared to Alan Rickman from "Die hard" or Jeremy Irons from "Die hard 3". Anyway , it's a good continuation of McClane's story . There is nothing new here , but it's well executed. In the end it's one of those rare satisfying sequels. I give it 8/10.

    This follow-up to the brilliant Die Hard could have been so much more. But once a British Airways plane had been crashed into the ground and 400-odd people had died, no victory of McClaine's could seem remotely satisfying. This moment may well be the biggest murder scene of the whole 80's/90's action film genre and gives the film one of the highest body counts of it. The film has all the elements of a great hero/action movie but a rather hollow feel to the whole adventure. It's as if a list was made of what made Die Hard great and at least two of everything shoved into this script. If you don't get to see it, you might not be heartbroken.

    If you can swallow the preposterous notion that 'the same s**t can happen to the same guy twice' then the chances are that you'll have a great time with this explosive, big-budget sequel by Finnish film-maker Renny Harlin. A man clearly at home working in a cold environment, Harlin makes the most of his sub-zero Dulles Airport backdrop, delivering a frozen flurry of knuckle-bruising, bullet-riddled scenes of mayhem guaranteed to give avid action fans goosebumps. Bruce Willis, reprising his role as tough NY cop John McClane, effortlessly smirks his way through countless bloody gunfights and brutal smack downs against a team of highly trained mercenaries trying to free a deposed dictator/drugs baron (played by cult Euro actor Franco Nero), making this one even more violent than it's predecessor (icicle in the eyeyowch!). Although the plot lacks the purity of the original, and William Sadler's Col. Stuart can't hold a candle to Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber for sheer villainy, Die Hard 2 is still one hell of an enjoyable action flick.

    Of the five Die Hard movies this is my least favorite. Don't get me wrong it is still a great movie. It is the return of one of the best action characters of the second half of the 20th Century... John McClane. Bruce Willis his role as John McClane, a police detective in the right place at the wrong time. This time he goes up against ex-military mercenaries in an airport. The mercenaries are trying to help in the escape of Ramon Esperanza, a general from the Republic of Val Verde, who is being extradited to the U.S. to stand trial for drug trafficking. McClane is, again, trying to save his wife who is on a plane in the skies above Dulles International Airport. Again the action starts out slow, but picks up as soon as John McClane gets involved in the action. He runs all over the airport in his quest to save his wife. John is thwarted several times along the way. One poignant scene is of McClane trying to avert a plane crash of a British Airways flight. He makes makeshift torches and runs out on the tarmac to signal to the plane that they are in danger. McClane is unsuccessful as the British Airways flight crashes into the runway killing all aboard. This shows the futility of the situation McClane finds himself in, but he doesn't give up. Quit just isn't in McClane's make-up. There are three parts of the movie I like the best. The first is when Richard Thornburg (played by William Atherton) is in the lavatory on the same plane as Holly McClane (played by Bonnie Bedelia). Thornburg is in the lavatory on the phone giving an account of the terrorist situation to the news station he works for; Holly uses the tazer of the lady next to her and breaks into the lavatory where she zaps Thornburg. The next favorite scene is when McClane is trying to save the British Airways flight. My third favorite scene is when McClane figures out a specific piece of information and brings it to the attention of Captain Carmine Lorenzo (played by Dennis Franz), of the Dulles Airport Police Department. Lorenzo, in his inexhaustible fashion, doesn't believe McClane. McClane takes his evidence, a machine gun, and proceeds to empty the clip at Lorenzo. The bullets in the machine gun are blanks. Even though this is not one of my favorite Die Hard movies I still rate it an 8 out of 10 stars.

    Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a good sequel as it contains great action, a good villain, and Bruce Willis at its best. The only problem is that it is unoriginal with the same premise as the first in many ways. John McClane is waiting for his wife's plane to land, but when in the airport, the tower is hijacked by terrorists and the planes cannot land as they loose contact with Dulles Tower and can't see the runway. John McClane must now do what he did last time, stop the terrorists and save his wife from sudden death. The film copies the same formula that worked well for the first, a terrorist group keeps hostages and Holly being one of them and John must then save same from death. One of the funny things though in the movie is at two points there is a line where they state how this has happened to them again so at least they admit it. One thing that helped drive the first and helps with this one is its villain. Colonel Stuart is a very good villain, no Hans Gruber, but a good one and the add a twist in this one as there is another military commander working for them which messes up things later in the movie. The movie still relies heavily on its action and it doesn't disappointment with bullets flying, explosions all around, tense fight scenes and a good climax. Die Hard 2 should not disappoint and is a fine addition to a new series. Grade: B+

The next thing you realise is the films over and your popcorn's finished and you want to watch it again! MORE MORE! your thinking. You don't need to watch the 1st film to understand whats going on. This is as good if not better then the first, i cant decide. Its story line isn't complicated. It does everything you expect and want. Action, Comedy and Action! The idea is not to sit down and review the hell out of this sort of film but enjoy it.

    Die Hard 2 isn't as good as the first, but still makes for a most enjoyable action movie, with stupendous, far-fetched escapades ensuring constant thrills. This sees yet another crisis for John McClane, this time at Dulles International Airport. One of the main reasons it works is having a normal guy like John McClane thrust into absurd situations, and McClane often comments on not only the scrapes he's getting into, but his disbelief that he's faced with yet another terrorist scenario after the events of the first film. The constant referencing does get annoying after awhile though - it wasn't really necessary to remind us of it throughout the film, all the way to the end.

    Die Hard was good. But its sequel fairs a lot less because the fun quotient declined drastically because of the huge number of illogical references/sequences. Bruce Willis is great as always, with his wit & death-defying stunts. Only the plot was a tad too lame for some action scenes were I personally believe, death would've been imminent. The airport ambiance and the terror suspense builds up for sure, but when it reaches crescendo, little disappointment accompanies it much unlike the predecessor. But you should watch it to believe it. Direction is appreciable, screenplay is kinda jerky because I expected one or two punchlines here and there, of course from Bruce but that is not much of a problem when you have the remaining dialogs kick ass! Too much of explosions and mind-numbing fires actually degraded my film- watching experience, but yes, Die Hard 2 is one hell of an action movie with impeccable standards and mind-boggling instances. Supporting cast is great and no character was extra baggage, unlike Die Hard 1. BOTTOM LINE: Die Hard 2 is a must-watch if you are following the series and if you a thing for movies which speak nothing but only action. :D 7/10 Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: Mild | Sex: No | Nudity: Mild | Violence: Infinity | Gore: Highly Critical | Traumatizing factor: Critical | Smoking, Alcohol or Drugs: No

Even though this is not one of my favorite Die Hard movies I still rate it an 8 out of 10 stars.

    Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a good sequel as it contains great action, a good villain, and Bruce Willis at its best. The only problem is that it is unoriginal with the same premise as the first in many ways. John McClane is waiting for his wife's plane to land, but when in the airport, the tower is hijacked by terrorists and the planes cannot land as they loose contact with Dulles Tower and can't see the runway. John McClane must now do what he did last time, stop the terrorists and save his wife from sudden death. The film copies the same formula that worked well for the first, a terrorist group keeps hostages and Holly being one of them and John must then save same from death. One of the funny things though in the movie is at two points there is a line where they state how this has happened to them again so at least they admit it. One thing that helped drive the first and helps with this one is its villain. Colonel Stuart is a very good villain, no Hans Gruber, but a good one and the add a twist in this one as there is another military commander working for them which messes up things later in the movie. The movie still relies heavily on its action and it doesn't disappointment with bullets flying, explosions all around, tense fight scenes and a good climax. Die Hard 2 should not disappoint and is a fine addition to a new series. Grade: B+

    This film is your classic popcorn film. You sit down with your popcorn and before you know it the film has taken you on its ride. The next thing you realise is the films over and your popcorn's finished and you want to watch it again! MORE MORE! your thinking. You don't need to watch the 1st film to understand whats going on. This is as good if not better then the first, i cant decide. Its story line isn't complicated. It does everything you expect and want. Action, Comedy and Action! The idea is not to sit down and review the hell out of this sort of film but enjoy it.

    Die Hard 2 isn't as good as the first, but still makes for a most enjoyable action movie, with stupendous, far-fetched escapades ensuring constant thrills. This sees yet another crisis for John McClane, this time at Dulles International Airport. One of the main reasons it works is having a normal guy like John McClane thrust into absurd situations, and McClane often comments on not only the scrapes he's getting into, but his disbelief that he's faced with yet another terrorist scenario after the events of the first film. The constant referencing does get annoying after awhile though - it wasn't really necessary to remind us of it throughout the film, all the way to the end.

    Die Hard was good. But its sequel fairs a lot less because the fun quotient declined drastically because of the huge number of illogical references/sequences. Bruce Willis is great as always, with his wit & death-defying stunts. Only the plot was a tad too lame for some action scenes were I personally believe, death would've been imminent. The airport ambiance and the terror suspense builds up for sure, but when it reaches crescendo, little disappointment accompanies it much unlike the predecessor. But you should watch it to believe it. Direction is appreciable, screenplay is kinda jerky because I expected one or two punchlines here and there, of course from Bruce but that is not much of a problem when you have the remaining dialogs kick ass! Too much of explosions and mind-numbing fires actually degraded my film- watching experience, but yes, Die Hard 2 is one hell of an action movie with impeccable standards and mind-boggling instances. Supporting cast is great and no character was extra baggage, unlike Die Hard 1. BOTTOM LINE: Die Hard 2 is a must-watch if you are following the series and if you a thing for movies which speak nothing but only action. :D 7/10 Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: Mild | Sex: No | Nudity: Mild | Violence: Infinity | Gore: Highly Critical | Traumatizing factor: Critical | Smoking, Alcohol or Drugs: No

    Thriller with supercharged action and moving pacing by Renny Harlin . Gripping , splendid action movie with the great Bruce Willis desperately trying to find the means avoid his wife to be crashed . This mindless, interesting and ingenious film is packed with thrills , suspense , tension and lots of interminable action . Again John McClane, officer of the NYPD and hero of the Nakatomi Hostage Crisis, attempts to avert disaster as rogue military officials seize control of Dulles International Airport in Washington . Once again he is in the wrong place at the wrong time , as some criminals led by rebel Col. Stuart (William Sadler) wish to free a drug baron (Franco Nero , this role is a reference to the real-life Panamanian general, Manuel Noriega, who was overthrown for brutality and drug trafficking in Panama in the 1980s and being turned over to the US government) . An army of killers want to free a known South American general being extradited to America for trial , but they have only one little problem: John McClane (Bruce Willis). This second part also contains noisy action , thrills , explosions , plot twists , and lots of fun . Good sequel that follows a similar style , humor and action . From the start to finish the action packed is unstopped and spectacular . Exciting screenplay that dispenses absurd excitement as well as amusement . Excellent thriller full of intrigue and tense, this is a fast-paced, stylized action-suspense film . The tension of this picture keeps snowballing as the clock ticks ever close for a groundbreaking as well as impressive final . As always , Bruce Willis is very fine as hilarious , sarcastic and intrepid cop . Secondary casting is frankly well , such as Franco Nero , William Atherton , Dennis Franz , Fred Dalton Thomson , Reginald VelJohnson , John Amos , Tom Bower , Sheila McCarthy , Don Harvey , a brief acting by John Leguizano and Robert Patick ; furthermore , William Sadler steals the show and takes honors as psychopath who attempts to turn the tables on the protagonist . Adequate and thrilling musical score accompanying the action by Michael Kamen . Inventively photographed by Oliver Wood ; most of the interior airport scenes were filmed in the Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International airport . In addition , some of the shots of the airport were filmed at the old Stapleton Airport in Denver, Colorado. This big-budgeted motion picture was lavishly produced by Lawrence Binder and Joel Silver , being well directed by Renny Harlin . Renny edited this film and The adventures of Ford Fairlane at the same time because of the relatively short post-production period for both films and were then released one month apart . John McTiernan who directed &uml;Die Hard&uml; had planned to direct this film, but could not because of his commitment to directing Hunt for Red October . Renny Harlin is an expert on action genre such as &uml; Cliffhunger&uml; , &uml;Deep blue sea&uml; , &uml;Driven&uml; , &uml;Long kiss goodnight&uml; , &uml;12 rounds&uml; and many others . Rating : Better than average thriller movie . The picture will appeal to frenetic action buffs and Bruce Willis fans .

    Sure it may be basically the first movie in an airport, and sure it may just be trying to catch lightning in a bottle a second time, but that doesn't mean Die Hard 2 isn't enjoyable. It's still a lot of fun from start to finish. John McClane is still a likable a**hole and although the villain isn't on par with Hans Gruber, he's still an okay villain. Nothing too special but still has all the requirements. The action is still tons of fun, especially the plane crashes. My favorite scene is probably the scene when John attempts to help a commercial jet land after the terrorist leader has shut off the lights on the runway, but fails and the plane crashes anyway, and John just sits on the stairs in the next shot broken and teary-eyed. This shows that John is still a human being that cared for all the lives he failed to save. Every man woman and child. Despite its flaws, Die Hard 2 is still a fun action movie that still delivers the goods. 8/10

    *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I don't understand the complains about "Die hard 2 : Die harder" . The first movie was almost a perfect action movie . It was obvious that sequel will be weaker , yet "Die hard 2" is a very satisfying sequel . It follows the formula that worked so well the first time : one hero - one place - many terrorists , wife in danger , nobody listens to him except a black guy and everything happens during Christmas . There is not a bit of new idea here . The only change is the new director  Renny Harlin , who took over John McTiernan (who was busy with "The hunt for Red October") . Harlin is a solid craftsman and he directs the movie professionally. The screenplay was once again written by Steven Souza and with a help from Doug Richardson. I'm amazed by the complains about the violence and swearing . Look people , this is R rated movie . If you can't stand the heat , stay out of kitchen. Maybe people who are obsessed with political correctness forgot about it , but in REAL LIFE people swear . A lot. And there isn't a single scene of unnecessary violence here . When you're fighting for life you don't exactly have time for subtlety. If you're looking for mindless violence watch one of those stupid "Saw" movies. And for god's sake there is no plot hole with the planes . You want to know why the airplanes didn't tried to land on other airports ? Because they had too little fuel and the weather was too bad. So , they had to stay in the air. What I liked ? Bruce Willis is back as the wise cracking John McClane . So is Bonnie Bedelia as his wife. Reginald Veljohnson appears in a small episode as Al Powell. There are one dimensional , but fun characters : John Amos as the idiotic chef of airport security Carmine Lorenzo and Tom Bover as Marvin the wacky janitor. Souza has a sense of humor and there is a plenty of moments to laugh . The action scenes directed by Harlin are exciting and fun. The screenplay offers also some nice twists. What I didn't liked ? I could live without the naked tai chi . There is one scene with the grenades that makes my head hurt. Those have to be the slowest grenades in the movie history. I don't understand why the airport crew cooperated with the terrorists , even after the terrorists lost their equipment and couldn't blackmail the airport anymore. Also , the movie lacks a really good main villain compared to Alan Rickman from "Die hard" or Jeremy Irons from "Die hard 3". Anyway , it's a good continuation of McClane's story . There is nothing new here , but it's well executed. In the end it's one of those rare satisfying sequels. I give it 8/10.

    This follow-up to the brilliant Die Hard could have been so much more. But once a British Airways plane had been crashed into the ground and 400-odd people had died, no victory of McClaine's could seem remotely satisfying. This moment may well be the biggest murder scene of the whole 80's/90's action film genre and gives the film one of the highest body counts of it. The film has all the elements of a great hero/action movie but a rather hollow feel to the whole adventure. It's as if a list was made of what made Die Hard great and at least two of everything shoved into this script. If you don't get to see it, you might not be heartbroken.

    If you can swallow the preposterous notion that 'the same s**t can happen to the same guy twice' then the chances are that you'll have a great time with this explosive, big-budget sequel by Finnish film-maker Renny Harlin. A man clearly at home working in a cold environment, Harlin makes the most of his sub-zero Dulles Airport backdrop, delivering a frozen flurry of knuckle-bruising, bullet-riddled scenes of mayhem guaranteed to give avid action fans goosebumps. Bruce Willis, reprising his role as tough NY cop John McClane, effortlessly smirks his way through countless bloody gunfights and brutal smack downs against a team of highly trained mercenaries trying to free a deposed dictator/drugs baron (played by cult Euro actor Franco Nero), making this one even more violent than it's predecessor (icicle in the eyeyowch!). Although the plot lacks the purity of the original, and William Sadler's Col. Stuart can't hold a candle to Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber for sheer villainy, Die Hard 2 is still one hell of an enjoyable action flick.

    Of the five Die Hard movies this is my least favorite. Don't get me wrong it is still a great movie. It is the return of one of the best action characters of the second half of the 20th Century... John McClane. Bruce Willis his role as John McClane, a police detective in the right place at the wrong time. This time he goes up against ex-military mercenaries in an airport. The mercenaries are trying to help in the escape of Ramon Esperanza, a general from the Republic of Val Verde, who is being extradited to the U.S. to stand trial for drug trafficking. McClane is, again, trying to save his wife who is on a plane in the skies above Dulles International Airport. Again the action starts out slow, but picks up as soon as John McClane gets involved in the action. He runs all over the airport in his quest to save his wife. John is thwarted several times along the way. One poignant scene is of McClane trying to avert a plane crash of a British Airways flight. He makes makeshift torches and runs out on the tarmac to signal to the plane that they are in danger. McClane is unsuccessful as the British Airways flight crashes into the runway killing all aboard. This shows the futility of the situation McClane finds himself in, but he doesn't give up. Quit just isn't in McClane's make-up. There are three parts of the movie I like the best. The first is when Richard Thornburg (played by William Atherton) is in the lavatory on the same plane as Holly McClane (played by Bonnie Bedelia). Thornburg is in the lavatory on the phone giving an account of the terrorist situation to the news station he works for; Holly uses the tazer of the lady next to her and breaks into the lavatory where she zaps Thornburg. The next favorite scene is when McClane is trying to save the British Airways flight. My third favorite scene is when McClane figures out a specific piece of information and brings it to the attention of Captain Carmine Lorenzo (played by Dennis Franz), of the Dulles Airport Police Department. Lorenzo, in his inexhaustible fashion, doesn't believe McClane. McClane takes his evidence, a machine gun, and proceeds to empty the clip at Lorenzo. The bullets in the machine gun are blanks. Even though this is not one of my favorite Die Hard movies I still rate it an 8 out of 10 stars.

    If you can swallow the preposterous notion that 'the same s**t can happen to the same guy twice' then the chances are that you'll have a great time with this explosive, big-budget sequel by Finnish film-maker Renny Harlin. A man clearly at home working in a cold environment, Harlin makes the most of his sub-zero Dulles Airport backdrop, delivering a frozen flurry of knuckle-bruising, bullet-riddled scenes of mayhem guaranteed to give avid action fans goosebumps. Bruce Willis, reprising his role as tough NY cop John McClane, effortlessly smirks his way through countless bloody gunfights and brutal smack downs against a team of highly trained mercenaries trying to free a deposed dictator/drugs baron (played by cult Euro actor Franco Nero), making this one even more violent than it's predecessor (icicle in the eyeyowch!). Although the plot lacks the purity of the original, and William Sadler's Col. Stuart can't hold a candle to Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber for sheer villainy, Die Hard 2 is still one hell of an enjoyable action flick.

    Of the five Die Hard movies this is my least favorite. Don't get me wrong it is still a great movie. It is the return of one of the best action characters of the second half of the 20th Century... John McClane. Bruce Willis his role as John McClane, a police detective in the right place at the wrong time. This time he goes up against ex-military mercenaries in an airport. The mercenaries are trying to help in the escape of Ramon Esperanza, a general from the Republic of Val Verde, who is being extradited to the U.S. to stand trial for drug trafficking. McClane is, again, trying to save his wife who is on a plane in the skies above Dulles International Airport. Again the action starts out slow, but picks up as soon as John McClane gets involved in the action. He runs all over the airport in his quest to save his wife. John is thwarted several times along the way. One poignant scene is of McClane trying to avert a plane crash of a British Airways flight. He makes makeshift torches and runs out on the tarmac to signal to the plane that they are in danger. McClane is unsuccessful as the British Airways flight crashes into the runway killing all aboard. This shows the futility of the situation McClane finds himself in, but he doesn't give up. Quit just isn't in McClane's make-up. There are three parts of the movie I like the best. The first is when Richard Thornburg (played by William Atherton) is in the lavatory on the same plane as Holly McClane (played by Bonnie Bedelia). Thornburg is in the lavatory on the phone giving an account of the terrorist situation to the news station he works for; Holly uses the tazer of the lady next to her and breaks into the lavatory where she zaps Thornburg. The next favorite scene is when McClane is trying to save the British Airways flight. My third favorite scene is when McClane figures out a specific piece of information and brings it to the attention of Captain Carmine Lorenzo (played by Dennis Franz), of the Dulles Airport Police Department. Lorenzo, in his inexhaustible fashion, doesn't believe McClane. McClane takes his evidence, a machine gun, and proceeds to empty the clip at Lorenzo. The bullets in the machine gun are blanks. Even though this is not one of my favorite Die Hard movies I still rate it an 8 out of 10 stars.

    Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a good sequel as it contains great action, a good villain, and Bruce Willis at its best. The only problem is that it is unoriginal with the same premise as the first in many ways. John McClane is waiting for his wife's plane to land, but when in the airport, the tower is hijacked by terrorists and the planes cannot land as they loose contact with Dulles Tower and can't see the runway. John McClane must now do what he did last time, stop the terrorists and save his wife from sudden death. The film copies the same formula that worked well for the first, a terrorist group keeps hostages and Holly being one of them and John must then save same from death. One of the funny things though in the movie is at two points there is a line where they state how this has happened to them again so at least they admit it. One thing that helped drive the first and helps with this one is its villain. Colonel Stuart is a very good villain, no Hans Gruber, but a good one and the add a twist in this one as there is another military commander working for them which messes up things later in the movie. The movie still relies heavily on its action and it doesn't disappointment with bullets flying, explosions all around, tense fight scenes and a good climax. Die Hard 2 should not disappoint and is a fine addition to a new series. Grade: B+

    This film is your classic popcorn film. You sit down with your popcorn and before you know it the film has taken you on its ride. The next thing you realise is the films over and your popcorn's finished and you want to watch it again! MORE MORE! your thinking. You don't need to watch the 1st film to understand whats going on. This is as good if not better then the first, i cant decide. Its story line isn't complicated. It does everything you expect and want. Action, Comedy and Action! The idea is not to sit down and review the hell out of this sort of film but enjoy it.

    Die Hard 2 isn't as good as the first, but still makes for a most enjoyable action movie, with stupendous, far-fetched escapades ensuring constant thrills. This sees yet another crisis for John McClane, this time at Dulles International Airport. One of the main reasons it works is having a normal guy like John McClane thrust into absurd situations, and McClane often comments on not only the scrapes he's getting into, but his disbelief that he's faced with yet another terrorist scenario after the events of the first film. The constant referencing does get annoying after awhile though - it wasn't really necessary to remind us of it throughout the film, all the way to the end.

    Die Hard was good. But its sequel fairs a lot less because the fun quotient declined drastically because of the huge number of illogical references/sequences. Bruce Willis is great as always, with his wit & death-defying stunts. Only the plot was a tad too lame for some action scenes were I personally believe, death would've been imminent. The airport ambiance and the terror suspense builds up for sure, but when it reaches crescendo, little disappointment accompanies it much unlike the predecessor. But you should watch it to believe it. Direction is appreciable, screenplay is kinda jerky because I expected one or two punchlines here and there, of course from Bruce but that is not much of a problem when you have the remaining dialogs kick ass! Too much of explosions and mind-numbing fires actually degraded my film- watching experience, but yes, Die Hard 2 is one hell of an action movie with impeccable standards and mind-boggling instances. Supporting cast is great and no character was extra baggage, unlike Die Hard 1. BOTTOM LINE: Die Hard 2 is a must-watch if you are following the series and if you a thing for movies which speak nothing but only action. :D 7/10 Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: Mild | Sex: No | Nudity: Mild | Violence: Infinity | Gore: Highly Critical | Traumatizing factor: Critical | Smoking, Alcohol or Drugs: No

    Thriller with supercharged action and moving pacing by Renny Harlin . Gripping , splendid action movie with the great Bruce Willis desperately trying to find the means avoid his wife to be crashed . This mindless, interesting and ingenious film is packed with thrills , suspense , tension and lots of interminable action . Again John McClane, officer of the NYPD and hero of the Nakatomi Hostage Crisis, attempts to avert disaster as rogue military officials seize control of Dulles International Airport in Washington . Once again he is in the wrong place at the wrong time , as some criminals led by rebel Col. Stuart (William Sadler) wish to free a drug baron (Franco Nero , this role is a reference to the real-life Panamanian general, Manuel Noriega, who was overthrown for brutality and drug trafficking in Panama in the 1980s and being turned over to the US government) . An army of killers want to free a known South American general being extradited to America for trial , but they have only one little problem: John McClane (Bruce Willis). This second part also contains noisy action , thrills , explosions , plot twists , and lots of fun . Good sequel that follows a similar style , humor and action . From the start to finish the action packed is unstopped and spectacular . Exciting screenplay that dispenses absurd excitement as well as amusement . Excellent thriller full of intrigue and tense, this is a fast-paced, stylized action-suspense film . The tension of this picture keeps snowballing as the clock ticks ever close for a groundbreaking as well as impressive final . As always , Bruce Willis is very fine as hilarious , sarcastic and intrepid cop . Secondary casting is frankly well , such as Franco Nero , William Atherton , Dennis Franz , Fred Dalton Thomson , Reginald VelJohnson , John Amos , Tom Bower , Sheila McCarthy , Don Harvey , a brief acting by John Leguizano and Robert Patick ; furthermore , William Sadler steals the show and takes honors as psychopath who attempts to turn the tables on the protagonist . Adequate and thrilling musical score accompanying the action by Michael Kamen . Inventively photographed by Oliver Wood ; most of the interior airport scenes were filmed in the Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International airport . In addition , some of the shots of the airport were filmed at the old Stapleton Airport in Denver, Colorado. This big-budgeted motion picture was lavishly produced by Lawrence Binder and Joel Silver , being well directed by Renny Harlin . Renny edited this film and The adventures of Ford Fairlane at the same time because of the relatively short post-production period for both films and were then released one month apart . John McTiernan who directed &uml;Die Hard&uml; had planned to direct this film, but could not because of his commitment to directing Hunt for Red October . Renny Harlin is an expert on action genre such as &uml; Cliffhunger&uml; , &uml;Deep blue sea&uml; , &uml;Driven&uml; , &uml;Long kiss goodnight&uml; , &uml;12 rounds&uml; and many others . Rating : Better than average thriller movie . The picture will appeal to frenetic action buffs and Bruce Willis fans .

    Sure it may be basically the first movie in an airport, and sure it may just be trying to catch lightning in a bottle a second time, but that doesn't mean Die Hard 2 isn't enjoyable. It's still a lot of fun from start to finish. John McClane is still a likable a**hole and although the villain isn't on par with Hans Gruber, he's still an okay villain. Nothing too special but still has all the requirements. The action is still tons of fun, especially the plane crashes. My favorite scene is probably the scene when John attempts to help a commercial jet land after the terrorist leader has shut off the lights on the runway, but fails and the plane crashes anyway, and John just sits on the stairs in the next shot broken and teary-eyed. This shows that John is still a human being that cared for all the lives he failed to save. Every man woman and child. Despite its flaws, Die Hard 2 is still a fun action movie that still delivers the goods. 8/10

    *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I don't understand the complains about "Die hard 2 : Die harder" . The first movie was almost a perfect action movie . It was obvious that sequel will be weaker , yet "Die hard 2" is a very satisfying sequel . It follows the formula that worked so well the first time : one hero - one place - many terrorists , wife in danger , nobody listens to him except a black guy and everything happens during Christmas . There is not a bit of new idea here . The only change is the new director  Renny Harlin , who took over John McTiernan (who was busy with "The hunt for Red October") . Harlin is a solid craftsman and he directs the movie professionally. The screenplay was once again written by Steven Souza and with a help from Doug Richardson. I'm amazed by the complains about the violence and swearing . Look people , this is R rated movie . If you can't stand the heat , stay out of kitchen. Maybe people who are obsessed with political correctness forgot about it , but in REAL LIFE people swear . A lot. And there isn't a single scene of unnecessary violence here . When you're fighting for life you don't exactly have time for subtlety. If you're looking for mindless violence watch one of those stupid "Saw" movies. And for god's sake there is no plot hole with the planes . You want to know why the airplanes didn't tried to land on other airports ? Because they had too little fuel and the weather was too bad. So , they had to stay in the air. What I liked ? Bruce Willis is back as the wise cracking John McClane . So is Bonnie Bedelia as his wife. Reginald Veljohnson appears in a small episode as Al Powell. There are one dimensional , but fun characters : John Amos as the idiotic chef of airport security Carmine Lorenzo and Tom Bover as Marvin the wacky janitor. Souza has a sense of humor and there is a plenty of moments to laugh . The action scenes directed by Harlin are exciting and fun. The screenplay offers also some nice twists. What I didn't liked ? I could live without the naked tai chi . There is one scene with the grenades that makes my head hurt. Those have to be the slowest grenades in the movie history. I don't understand why the airport crew cooperated with the terrorists , even after the terrorists lost their equipment and couldn't blackmail the airport anymore. Also , the movie lacks a really good main villain compared to Alan Rickman from "Die hard" or Jeremy Irons from "Die hard 3". Anyway , it's a good continuation of McClane's story . There is nothing new here , but it's well executed. In the end it's one of those rare satisfying sequels. I give it 8/10.

    This follow-up to the brilliant Die Hard could have been so much more. But once a British Airways plane had been crashed into the ground and 400-odd people had died, no victory of McClaine's could seem remotely satisfying. This moment may well be the biggest murder scene of the whole 80's/90's action film genre and gives the film one of the highest body counts of it. The film has all the elements of a great hero/action movie but a rather hollow feel to the whole adventure. It's as if a list was made of what made Die Hard great and at least two of everything shoved into this script. If you don't get to see it, you might not be heartbroken.

Harlin is a solid craftsman and he directs the movie professionally. The screenplay was once again written by Steven Souza and with a help from Doug Richardson. I'm amazed by the complains about the violence and swearing . Look people , this is R rated movie . If you can't stand the heat , stay out of kitchen. Maybe people who are obsessed with political correctness forgot about it , but in REAL LIFE people swear . A lot. And there isn't a single scene of unnecessary violence here . When you're fighting for life you don't exactly have time for subtlety. If you're looking for mindless violence watch one of those stupid "Saw" movies. And for god's sake there is no plot hole with the planes . You want to know why the airplanes didn't tried to land on other airports ? Because they had too little fuel and the weather was too bad. So , they had to stay in the air. What I liked ? Bruce Willis is back as the wise cracking John McClane . So is Bonnie Bedelia as his wife. Reginald Veljohnson appears in a small episode as Al Powell. There are one dimensional , but fun characters : John Amos as the idiotic chef of airport security Carmine Lorenzo and Tom Bover as Marvin the wacky janitor. Souza has a sense of humor and there is a plenty of moments to laugh . The action scenes directed by Harlin are exciting and fun. The screenplay offers also some nice twists. What I didn't liked ? I could live without the naked tai chi . There is one scene with the grenades that makes my head hurt. Those have to be the slowest grenades in the movie history. I don't understand why the airport crew cooperated with the terrorists , even after the terrorists lost their equipment and couldn't blackmail the airport anymore. Also , the movie lacks a really good main villain compared to Alan Rickman from "Die hard" or Jeremy Irons from "Die hard 3". Anyway , it's a good continuation of McClane's story . There is nothing new here , but it's well executed. In the end it's one of those rare satisfying sequels. I give it 8/10.

    This follow-up to the brilliant Die Hard could have been so much more. But once a British Airways plane had been crashed into the ground and 400-odd people had died, no victory of McClaine's could seem remotely satisfying. This moment may well be the biggest murder scene of the whole 80's/90's action film genre and gives the film one of the highest body counts of it. The film has all the elements of a great hero/action movie but a rather hollow feel to the whole adventure. It's as if a list was made of what made Die Hard great and at least two of everything shoved into this script. If you don't get to see it, you might not be heartbroken.

    If you can swallow the preposterous notion that 'the same s**t can happen to the same guy twice' then the chances are that you'll have a great time with this explosive, big-budget sequel by Finnish film-maker Renny Harlin. A man clearly at home working in a cold environment, Harlin makes the most of his sub-zero Dulles Airport backdrop, delivering a frozen flurry of knuckle-bruising, bullet-riddled scenes of mayhem guaranteed to give avid action fans goosebumps. Bruce Willis, reprising his role as tough NY cop John McClane, effortlessly smirks his way through countless bloody gunfights and brutal smack downs against a team of highly trained mercenaries trying to free a deposed dictator/drugs baron (played by cult Euro actor Franco Nero), making this one even more violent than it's predecessor (icicle in the eyeyowch!). Although the plot lacks the purity of the original, and William Sadler's Col. Stuart can't hold a candle to Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber for sheer villainy, Die Hard 2 is still one hell of an enjoyable action flick.

    Of the five Die Hard movies this is my least favorite. Don't get me wrong it is still a great movie. It is the return of one of the best action characters of the second half of the 20th Century... John McClane. Bruce Willis his role as John McClane, a police detective in the right place at the wrong time. This time he goes up against ex-military mercenaries in an airport. The mercenaries are trying to help in the escape of Ramon Esperanza, a general from the Republic of Val Verde, who is being extradited to the U.S. to stand trial for drug trafficking. McClane is, again, trying to save his wife who is on a plane in the skies above Dulles International Airport. Again the action starts out slow, but picks up as soon as John McClane gets involved in the action. He runs all over the airport in his quest to save his wife. John is thwarted several times along the way. One poignant scene is of McClane trying to avert a plane crash of a British Airways flight. He makes makeshift torches and runs out on the tarmac to signal to the plane that they are in danger. McClane is unsuccessful as the British Airways flight crashes into the runway killing all aboard. This shows the futility of the situation McClane finds himself in, but he doesn't give up. Quit just isn't in McClane's make-up. There are three parts of the movie I like the best. The first is when Richard Thornburg (played by William Atherton) is in the lavatory on the same plane as Holly McClane (played by Bonnie Bedelia). Thornburg is in the lavatory on the phone giving an account of the terrorist situation to the news station he works for; Holly uses the tazer of the lady next to her and breaks into the lavatory where she zaps Thornburg. The next favorite scene is when McClane is trying to save the British Airways flight. My third favorite scene is when McClane figures out a specific piece of information and brings it to the attention of Captain Carmine Lorenzo (played by Dennis Franz), of the Dulles Airport Police Department. Lorenzo, in his inexhaustible fashion, doesn't believe McClane. McClane takes his evidence, a machine gun, and proceeds to empty the clip at Lorenzo. The bullets in the machine gun are blanks. Even though this is not one of my favorite Die Hard movies I still rate it an 8 out of 10 stars.

    Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a good sequel as it contains great action, a good villain, and Bruce Willis at its best. The only problem is that it is unoriginal with the same premise as the first in many ways. John McClane is waiting for his wife's plane to land, but when in the airport, the tower is hijacked by terrorists and the planes cannot land as they loose contact with Dulles Tower and can't see the runway. John McClane must now do what he did last time, stop the terrorists and save his wife from sudden death. The film copies the same formula that worked well for the first, a terrorist group keeps hostages and Holly being one of them and John must then save same from death. One of the funny things though in the movie is at two points there is a line where they state how this has happened to them again so at least they admit it. One thing that helped drive the first and helps with this one is its villain. Colonel Stuart is a very good villain, no Hans Gruber, but a good one and the add a twist in this one as there is another military commander working for them which messes up things later in the movie. The movie still relies heavily on its action and it doesn't disappointment with bullets flying, explosions all around, tense fight scenes and a good climax. Die Hard 2 should not disappoint and is a fine addition to a new series. Grade: B+

    Die Hard 2 isn't as good as the first, but still makes for a most enjoyable action movie, with stupendous, far-fetched escapades ensuring constant thrills. This sees yet another crisis for John McClane, this time at Dulles International Airport. One of the main reasons it works is having a normal guy like John McClane thrust into absurd situations, and McClane often comments on not only the scrapes he's getting into, but his disbelief that he's faced with yet another terrorist scenario after the events of the first film. The constant referencing does get annoying after awhile though - it wasn't really necessary to remind us of it throughout the film, all the way to the end.

    Die Hard was good. But its sequel fairs a lot less because the fun quotient declined drastically because of the huge number of illogical references/sequences. Bruce Willis is great as always, with his wit & death-defying stunts. Only the plot was a tad too lame for some action scenes were I personally believe, death would've been imminent. The airport ambiance and the terror suspense builds up for sure, but when it reaches crescendo, little disappointment accompanies it much unlike the predecessor. But you should watch it to believe it. Direction is appreciable, screenplay is kinda jerky because I expected one or two punchlines here and there, of course from Bruce but that is not much of a problem when you have the remaining dialogs kick ass! Too much of explosions and mind-numbing fires actually degraded my film- watching experience, but yes, Die Hard 2 is one hell of an action movie with impeccable standards and mind-boggling instances. Supporting cast is great and no character was extra baggage, unlike Die Hard 1. BOTTOM LINE: Die Hard 2 is a must-watch if you are following the series and if you a thing for movies which speak nothing but only action. :D 7/10 Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: Mild | Sex: No | Nudity: Mild | Violence: Infinity | Gore: Highly Critical | Traumatizing factor: Critical | Smoking, Alcohol or Drugs: No

    Thriller with supercharged action and moving pacing by Renny Harlin . Gripping , splendid action movie with the great Bruce Willis desperately trying to find the means avoid his wife to be crashed . This mindless, interesting and ingenious film is packed with thrills , suspense , tension and lots of interminable action . Again John McClane, officer of the NYPD and hero of the Nakatomi Hostage Crisis, attempts to avert disaster as rogue military officials seize control of Dulles International Airport in Washington . Once again he is in the wrong place at the wrong time , as some criminals led by rebel Col. Stuart (William Sadler) wish to free a drug baron (Franco Nero , this role is a reference to the real-life Panamanian general, Manuel Noriega, who was overthrown for brutality and drug trafficking in Panama in the 1980s and being turned over to the US government) . An army of killers want to free a known South American general being extradited to America for trial , but they have only one little problem: John McClane (Bruce Willis). This second part also contains noisy action , thrills , explosions , plot twists , and lots of fun . Good sequel that follows a similar style , humor and action . From the start to finish the action packed is unstopped and spectacular . Exciting screenplay that dispenses absurd excitement as well as amusement . Excellent thriller full of intrigue and tense, this is a fast-paced, stylized action-suspense film . The tension of this picture keeps snowballing as the clock ticks ever close for a groundbreaking as well as impressive final . As always , Bruce Willis is very fine as hilarious , sarcastic and intrepid cop . Secondary casting is frankly well , such as Franco Nero , William Atherton , Dennis Franz , Fred Dalton Thomson , Reginald VelJohnson , John Amos , Tom Bower , Sheila McCarthy , Don Harvey , a brief acting by John Leguizano and Robert Patick ; furthermore , William Sadler steals the show and takes honors as psychopath who attempts to turn the tables on the protagonist . Adequate and thrilling musical score accompanying the action by Michael Kamen . Inventively photographed by Oliver Wood ; most of the interior airport scenes were filmed in the Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International airport . In addition , some of the shots of the airport were filmed at the old Stapleton Airport in Denver, Colorado. This big-budgeted motion picture was lavishly produced by Lawrence Binder and Joel Silver , being well directed by Renny Harlin . Renny edited this film and The adventures of Ford Fairlane at the same time because of the relatively short post-production period for both films and were then released one month apart . John McTiernan who directed &uml;Die Hard&uml; had planned to direct this film, but could not because of his commitment to directing Hunt for Red October . Renny Harlin is an expert on action genre such as &uml; Cliffhunger&uml; , &uml;Deep blue sea&uml; , &uml;Driven&uml; , &uml;Long kiss goodnight&uml; , &uml;12 rounds&uml; and many others . Rating : Better than average thriller movie . The picture will appeal to frenetic action buffs and Bruce Willis fans .

    Sure it may be basically the first movie in an airport, and sure it may just be trying to catch lightning in a bottle a second time, but that doesn't mean Die Hard 2 isn't enjoyable. It's still a lot of fun from start to finish. John McClane is still a likable a**hole and although the villain isn't on par with Hans Gruber, he's still an okay villain. Nothing too special but still has all the requirements. The action is still tons of fun, especially the plane crashes. My favorite scene is probably the scene when John attempts to help a commercial jet land after the terrorist leader has shut off the lights on the runway, but fails and the plane crashes anyway, and John just sits on the stairs in the next shot broken and teary-eyed. This shows that John is still a human being that cared for all the lives he failed to save. Every man woman and child. Despite its flaws, Die Hard 2 is still a fun action movie that still delivers the goods. 8/10

    *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I don't understand the complains about "Die hard 2 : Die harder" . The first movie was almost a perfect action movie . It was obvious that sequel will be weaker , yet "Die hard 2" is a very satisfying sequel . It follows the formula that worked so well the first time : one hero - one place - many terrorists , wife in danger , nobody listens to him except a black guy and everything happens during Christmas . There is not a bit of new idea here . The only change is the new director  Renny Harlin , who took over John McTiernan (who was busy with "The hunt for Red October") . Harlin is a solid craftsman and he directs the movie professionally. The screenplay was once again written by Steven Souza and with a help from Doug Richardson. I'm amazed by the complains about the violence and swearing . Look people , this is R rated movie . If you can't stand the heat , stay out of kitchen. Maybe people who are obsessed with political correctness forgot about it , but in REAL LIFE people swear . A lot. And there isn't a single scene of unnecessary violence here . When you're fighting for life you don't exactly have time for subtlety. If you're looking for mindless violence watch one of those stupid "Saw" movies. And for god's sake there is no plot hole with the planes . You want to know why the airplanes didn't tried to land on other airports ? Because they had too little fuel and the weather was too bad.

Secondary casting is frankly well , such as Franco Nero , William Atherton , Dennis Franz , Fred Dalton Thomson , Reginald VelJohnson , John Amos , Tom Bower , Sheila McCarthy , Don Harvey , a brief acting by John Leguizano and Robert Patick ; furthermore , William Sadler steals the show and takes honors as psychopath who attempts to turn the tables on the protagonist . Adequate and thrilling musical score accompanying the action by Michael Kamen . Inventively photographed by Oliver Wood ; most of the interior airport scenes were filmed in the Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International airport . In addition , some of the shots of the airport were filmed at the old Stapleton Airport in Denver, Colorado. This big-budgeted motion picture was lavishly produced by Lawrence Binder and Joel Silver , being well directed by Renny Harlin . Renny edited this film and The adventures of Ford Fairlane at the same time because of the relatively short post-production period for both films and were then released one month apart . John McTiernan who directed &uml;Die Hard&uml; had planned to direct this film, but could not because of his commitment to directing Hunt for Red October . Renny Harlin is an expert on action genre such as &uml; Cliffhunger&uml; , &uml;Deep blue sea&uml; , &uml;Driven&uml; , &uml;Long kiss goodnight&uml; , &uml;12 rounds&uml; and many others . Rating : Better than average thriller movie . The picture will appeal to frenetic action buffs and Bruce Willis fans .

    Sure it may be basically the first movie in an airport, and sure it may just be trying to catch lightning in a bottle a second time, but that doesn't mean Die Hard 2 isn't enjoyable. It's still a lot of fun from start to finish. John McClane is still a likable a**hole and although the villain isn't on par with Hans Gruber, he's still an okay villain. Nothing too special but still has all the requirements. The action is still tons of fun, especially the plane crashes. My favorite scene is probably the scene when John attempts to help a commercial jet land after the terrorist leader has shut off the lights on the runway, but fails and the plane crashes anyway, and John just sits on the stairs in the next shot broken and teary-eyed. This shows that John is still a human being that cared for all the lives he failed to save. Every man woman and child. Despite its flaws, Die Hard 2 is still a fun action movie that still delivers the goods. 8/10

    *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I don't understand the complains about "Die hard 2 : Die harder" . The first movie was almost a perfect action movie . It was obvious that sequel will be weaker , yet "Die hard 2" is a very satisfying sequel . It follows the formula that worked so well the first time : one hero - one place - many terrorists , wife in danger , nobody listens to him except a black guy and everything happens during Christmas . There is not a bit of new idea here . The only change is the new director  Renny Harlin , who took over John McTiernan (who was busy with "The hunt for Red October") . Harlin is a solid craftsman and he directs the movie professionally. The screenplay was once again written by Steven Souza and with a help from Doug Richardson. I'm amazed by the complains about the violence and swearing . Look people , this is R rated movie . If you can't stand the heat , stay out of kitchen. Maybe people who are obsessed with political correctness forgot about it , but in REAL LIFE people swear . A lot. And there isn't a single scene of unnecessary violence here . When you're fighting for life you don't exactly have time for subtlety. If you're looking for mindless violence watch one of those stupid "Saw" movies. And for god's sake there is no plot hole with the planes . You want to know why the airplanes didn't tried to land on other airports ? Because they had too little fuel and the weather was too bad. So , they had to stay in the air. What I liked ? Bruce Willis is back as the wise cracking John McClane . So is Bonnie Bedelia as his wife. Reginald Veljohnson appears in a small episode as Al Powell. There are one dimensional , but fun characters : John Amos as the idiotic chef of airport security Carmine Lorenzo and Tom Bover as Marvin the wacky janitor. Souza has a sense of humor and there is a plenty of moments to laugh . The action scenes directed by Harlin are exciting and fun. The screenplay offers also some nice twists. What I didn't liked ? I could live without the naked tai chi . There is one scene with the grenades that makes my head hurt. Those have to be the slowest grenades in the movie history. I don't understand why the airport crew cooperated with the terrorists , even after the terrorists lost their equipment and couldn't blackmail the airport anymore. Also , the movie lacks a really good main villain compared to Alan Rickman from "Die hard" or Jeremy Irons from "Die hard 3". Anyway , it's a good continuation of McClane's story . There is nothing new here , but it's well executed. In the end it's one of those rare satisfying sequels. I give it 8/10.

    This follow-up to the brilliant Die Hard could have been so much more. But once a British Airways plane had been crashed into the ground and 400-odd people had died, no victory of McClaine's could seem remotely satisfying. This moment may well be the biggest murder scene of the whole 80's/90's action film genre and gives the film one of the highest body counts of it. The film has all the elements of a great hero/action movie but a rather hollow feel to the whole adventure. It's as if a list was made of what made Die Hard great and at least two of everything shoved into this script. If you don't get to see it, you might not be heartbroken.

    If you can swallow the preposterous notion that 'the same s**t can happen to the same guy twice' then the chances are that you'll have a great time with this explosive, big-budget sequel by Finnish film-maker Renny Harlin. A man clearly at home working in a cold environment, Harlin makes the most of his sub-zero Dulles Airport backdrop, delivering a frozen flurry of knuckle-bruising, bullet-riddled scenes of mayhem guaranteed to give avid action fans goosebumps. Bruce Willis, reprising his role as tough NY cop John McClane, effortlessly smirks his way through countless bloody gunfights and brutal smack downs against a team of highly trained mercenaries trying to free a deposed dictator/drugs baron (played by cult Euro actor Franco Nero), making this one even more violent than it's predecessor (icicle in the eyeyowch!). Although the plot lacks the purity of the original, and William Sadler's Col. Stuart can't hold a candle to Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber for sheer villainy, Die Hard 2 is still one hell of an enjoyable action flick.

    Of the five Die Hard movies this is my least favorite. Don't get me wrong it is still a great movie. It is the return of one of the best action characters of the second half of the 20th Century... John McClane. Bruce Willis his role as John McClane, a police detective in the right place at the wrong time. This time he goes up against ex-military mercenaries in an airport. The mercenaries are trying to help in the escape of Ramon Esperanza, a general from the Republic of Val Verde, who is being extradited to the U.S. to stand trial for drug trafficking. McClane is, again, trying to save his wife who is on a plane in the skies above Dulles International Airport. Again the action starts out slow, but picks up as soon as John McClane gets involved in the action. He runs all over the airport in his quest to save his wife. John is thwarted several times along the way. One poignant scene is of McClane trying to avert a plane crash of a British Airways flight. He makes makeshift torches and runs out on the tarmac to signal to the plane that they are in danger. McClane is unsuccessful as the British Airways flight crashes into the runway killing all aboard. This shows the futility of the situation McClane finds himself in, but he doesn't give up. Quit just isn't in McClane's make-up. There are three parts of the movie I like the best. The first is when Richard Thornburg (played by William Atherton) is in the lavatory on the same plane as Holly McClane (played by Bonnie Bedelia). Thornburg is in the lavatory on the phone giving an account of the terrorist situation to the news station he works for; Holly uses the tazer of the lady next to her and breaks into the lavatory where she zaps Thornburg. The next favorite scene is when McClane is trying to save the British Airways flight. My third favorite scene is when McClane figures out a specific piece of information and brings it to the attention of Captain Carmine Lorenzo (played by Dennis Franz), of the Dulles Airport Police Department. Lorenzo, in his inexhaustible fashion, doesn't believe McClane. McClane takes his evidence, a machine gun, and proceeds to empty the clip at Lorenzo. The bullets in the machine gun are blanks. Even though this is not one of my favorite Die Hard movies I still rate it an 8 out of 10 stars.

    Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a good sequel as it contains great action, a good villain, and Bruce Willis at its best. The only problem is that it is unoriginal with the same premise as the first in many ways. John McClane is waiting for his wife's plane to land, but when in the airport, the tower is hijacked by terrorists and the planes cannot land as they loose contact with Dulles Tower and can't see the runway. John McClane must now do what he did last time, stop the terrorists and save his wife from sudden death. The film copies the same formula that worked well for the first, a terrorist group keeps hostages and Holly being one of them and John must then save same from death. One of the funny things though in the movie is at two points there is a line where they state how this has happened to them again so at least they admit it. One thing that helped drive the first and helps with this one is its villain. Colonel Stuart is a very good villain, no Hans Gruber, but a good one and the add a twist in this one as there is another military commander working for them which messes up things later in the movie. The movie still relies heavily on its action and it doesn't disappointment with bullets flying, explosions all around, tense fight scenes and a good climax. Die Hard 2 should not disappoint and is a fine addition to a new series. Grade: B+

The next thing you realise is the films over and your popcorn's finished and you want to watch it again! MORE MORE! your thinking. You don't need to watch the 1st film to understand whats going on. This is as good if not better then the first, i cant decide. Its story line isn't complicated. It does everything you expect and want. Action, Comedy and Action! The idea is not to sit down and review the hell out of this sort of film but enjoy it.

    Die Hard 2 isn't as good as the first, but still makes for a most enjoyable action movie, with stupendous, far-fetched escapades ensuring constant thrills. This sees yet another crisis for John McClane, this time at Dulles International Airport. One of the main reasons it works is having a normal guy like John McClane thrust into absurd situations, and McClane often comments on not only the scrapes he's getting into, but his disbelief that he's faced with yet another terrorist scenario after the events of the first film. The constant referencing does get annoying after awhile though - it wasn't really necessary to remind us of it throughout the film, all the way to the end.

    Die Hard was good. But its sequel fairs a lot less because the fun quotient declined drastically because of the huge number of illogical references/sequences. Bruce Willis is great as always, with his wit & death-defying stunts. Only the plot was a tad too lame for some action scenes were I personally believe, death would've been imminent. The airport ambiance and the terror suspense builds up for sure, but when it reaches crescendo, little disappointment accompanies it much unlike the predecessor. But you should watch it to believe it. Direction is appreciable, screenplay is kinda jerky because I expected one or two punchlines here and there, of course from Bruce but that is not much of a problem when you have the remaining dialogs kick ass! Too much of explosions and mind-numbing fires actually degraded my film- watching experience, but yes, Die Hard 2 is one hell of an action movie with impeccable standards and mind-boggling instances. Supporting cast is great and no character was extra baggage, unlike Die Hard 1. BOTTOM LINE: Die Hard 2 is a must-watch if you are following the series and if you a thing for movies which speak nothing but only action. :D 7/10 Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: Mild | Sex: No | Nudity: Mild | Violence: Infinity | Gore: Highly Critical | Traumatizing factor: Critical | Smoking, Alcohol or Drugs: No

    Thriller with supercharged action and moving pacing by Renny Harlin . Gripping , splendid action movie with the great Bruce Willis desperately trying to find the means avoid his wife to be crashed . This mindless, interesting and ingenious film is packed with thrills , suspense , tension and lots of interminable action . Again John McClane, officer of the NYPD and hero of the Nakatomi Hostage Crisis, attempts to avert disaster as rogue military officials seize control of Dulles International Airport in Washington . Once again he is in the wrong place at the wrong time , as some criminals led by rebel Col. Stuart (William Sadler) wish to free a drug baron (Franco Nero , this role is a reference to the real-life Panamanian general, Manuel Noriega, who was overthrown for brutality and drug trafficking in Panama in the 1980s and being turned over to the US government) . An army of killers want to free a known South American general being extradited to America for trial , but they have only one little problem: John McClane (Bruce Willis). This second part also contains noisy action , thrills , explosions , plot twists , and lots of fun . Good sequel that follows a similar style , humor and action . From the start to finish the action packed is unstopped and spectacular . Exciting screenplay that dispenses absurd excitement as well as amusement . Excellent thriller full of intrigue and tense, this is a fast-paced, stylized action-suspense film . The tension of this picture keeps snowballing as the clock ticks ever close for a groundbreaking as well as impressive final . As always , Bruce Willis is very fine as hilarious , sarcastic and intrepid cop . Secondary casting is frankly well , such as Franco Nero , William Atherton , Dennis Franz , Fred Dalton Thomson , Reginald VelJohnson , John Amos , Tom Bower , Sheila McCarthy , Don Harvey , a brief acting by John Leguizano and Robert Patick ; furthermore , William Sadler steals the show and takes honors as psychopath who attempts to turn the tables on the protagonist . Adequate and thrilling musical score accompanying the action by Michael Kamen . Inventively photographed by Oliver Wood ; most of the interior airport scenes were filmed in the Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International airport . In addition , some of the shots of the airport were filmed at the old Stapleton Airport in Denver, Colorado. This big-budgeted motion picture was lavishly produced by Lawrence Binder and Joel Silver , being well directed by Renny Harlin . Renny edited this film and The adventures of Ford Fairlane at the same time because of the relatively short post-production period for both films and were then released one month apart . John McTiernan who directed &uml;Die Hard&uml; had planned to direct this film, but could not because of his commitment to directing Hunt for Red October . Renny Harlin is an expert on action genre such as &uml; Cliffhunger&uml; , &uml;Deep blue sea&uml; , &uml;Driven&uml; , &uml;Long kiss goodnight&uml; , &uml;12 rounds&uml; and many others . Rating : Better than average thriller movie . The picture will appeal to frenetic action buffs and Bruce Willis fans .

    Die Hard was good. But its sequel fairs a lot less because the fun quotient declined drastically because of the huge number of illogical references/sequences. Bruce Willis is great as always, with his wit & death-defying stunts. Only the plot was a tad too lame for some action scenes were I personally believe, death would've been imminent. The airport ambiance and the terror suspense builds up for sure, but when it reaches crescendo, little disappointment accompanies it much unlike the predecessor. But you should watch it to believe it. Direction is appreciable, screenplay is kinda jerky because I expected one or two punchlines here and there, of course from Bruce but that is not much of a problem when you have the remaining dialogs kick ass! Too much of explosions and mind-numbing fires actually degraded my film- watching experience, but yes, Die Hard 2 is one hell of an action movie with impeccable standards and mind-boggling instances. Supporting cast is great and no character was extra baggage, unlike Die Hard 1. BOTTOM LINE: Die Hard 2 is a must-watch if you are following the series and if you a thing for movies which speak nothing but only action. :D 7/10 Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: Mild | Sex: No | Nudity: Mild | Violence: Infinity | Gore: Highly Critical | Traumatizing factor: Critical | Smoking, Alcohol or Drugs: No

    Thriller with supercharged action and moving pacing by Renny Harlin . Gripping , splendid action movie with the great Bruce Willis desperately trying to find the means avoid his wife to be crashed . This mindless, interesting and ingenious film is packed with thrills , suspense , tension and lots of interminable action . Again John McClane, officer of the NYPD and hero of the Nakatomi Hostage Crisis, attempts to avert disaster as rogue military officials seize control of Dulles International Airport in Washington . Once again he is in the wrong place at the wrong time , as some criminals led by rebel Col. Stuart (William Sadler) wish to free a drug baron (Franco Nero , this role is a reference to the real-life Panamanian general, Manuel Noriega, who was overthrown for brutality and drug trafficking in Panama in the 1980s and being turned over to the US government) . An army of killers want to free a known South American general being extradited to America for trial , but they have only one little problem: John McClane (Bruce Willis). This second part also contains noisy action , thrills , explosions , plot twists , and lots of fun . Good sequel that follows a similar style , humor and action . From the start to finish the action packed is unstopped and spectacular . Exciting screenplay that dispenses absurd excitement as well as amusement . Excellent thriller full of intrigue and tense, this is a fast-paced, stylized action-suspense film . The tension of this picture keeps snowballing as the clock ticks ever close for a groundbreaking as well as impressive final . As always , Bruce Willis is very fine as hilarious , sarcastic and intrepid cop . Secondary casting is frankly well , such as Franco Nero , William Atherton , Dennis Franz , Fred Dalton Thomson , Reginald VelJohnson , John Amos , Tom Bower , Sheila McCarthy , Don Harvey , a brief acting by John Leguizano and Robert Patick ; furthermore , William Sadler steals the show and takes honors as psychopath who attempts to turn the tables on the protagonist . Adequate and thrilling musical score accompanying the action by Michael Kamen . Inventively photographed by Oliver Wood ; most of the interior airport scenes were filmed in the Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International airport . In addition , some of the shots of the airport were filmed at the old Stapleton Airport in Denver, Colorado. This big-budgeted motion picture was lavishly produced by Lawrence Binder and Joel Silver , being well directed by Renny Harlin . Renny edited this film and The adventures of Ford Fairlane at the same time because of the relatively short post-production period for both films and were then released one month apart . John McTiernan who directed &uml;Die Hard&uml; had planned to direct this film, but could not because of his commitment to directing Hunt for Red October . Renny Harlin is an expert on action genre such as &uml; Cliffhunger&uml; , &uml;Deep blue sea&uml; , &uml;Driven&uml; , &uml;Long kiss goodnight&uml; , &uml;12 rounds&uml; and many others . Rating : Better than average thriller movie . The picture will appeal to frenetic action buffs and Bruce Willis fans .

    Sure it may be basically the first movie in an airport, and sure it may just be trying to catch lightning in a bottle a second time, but that doesn't mean Die Hard 2 isn't enjoyable. It's still a lot of fun from start to finish. John McClane is still a likable a**hole and although the villain isn't on par with Hans Gruber, he's still an okay villain. Nothing too special but still has all the requirements. The action is still tons of fun, especially the plane crashes. My favorite scene is probably the scene when John attempts to help a commercial jet land after the terrorist leader has shut off the lights on the runway, but fails and the plane crashes anyway, and John just sits on the stairs in the next shot broken and teary-eyed. This shows that John is still a human being that cared for all the lives he failed to save. Every man woman and child. Despite its flaws, Die Hard 2 is still a fun action movie that still delivers the goods. 8/10

    *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I don't understand the complains about "Die hard 2 : Die harder" . The first movie was almost a perfect action movie . It was obvious that sequel will be weaker , yet "Die hard 2" is a very satisfying sequel . It follows the formula that worked so well the first time : one hero - one place - many terrorists , wife in danger , nobody listens to him except a black guy and everything happens during Christmas . There is not a bit of new idea here . The only change is the new director  Renny Harlin , who took over John McTiernan (who was busy with "The hunt for Red October") . Harlin is a solid craftsman and he directs the movie professionally. The screenplay was once again written by Steven Souza and with a help from Doug Richardson. I'm amazed by the complains about the violence and swearing . Look people , this is R rated movie . If you can't stand the heat , stay out of kitchen. Maybe people who are obsessed with political correctness forgot about it , but in REAL LIFE people swear . A lot. And there isn't a single scene of unnecessary violence here . When you're fighting for life you don't exactly have time for subtlety. If you're looking for mindless violence watch one of those stupid "Saw" movies. And for god's sake there is no plot hole with the planes . You want to know why the airplanes didn't tried to land on other airports ? Because they had too little fuel and the weather was too bad. So , they had to stay in the air. What I liked ? Bruce Willis is back as the wise cracking John McClane . So is Bonnie Bedelia as his wife. Reginald Veljohnson appears in a small episode as Al Powell. There are one dimensional , but fun characters : John Amos as the idiotic chef of airport security Carmine Lorenzo and Tom Bover as Marvin the wacky janitor. Souza has a sense of humor and there is a plenty of moments to laugh . The action scenes directed by Harlin are exciting and fun. The screenplay offers also some nice twists. What I didn't liked ? I could live without the naked tai chi . There is one scene with the grenades that makes my head hurt. Those have to be the slowest grenades in the movie history. I don't understand why the airport crew cooperated with the terrorists , even after the terrorists lost their equipment and couldn't blackmail the airport anymore. Also , the movie lacks a really good main villain compared to Alan Rickman from "Die hard" or Jeremy Irons from "Die hard 3". Anyway , it's a good continuation of McClane's story . There is nothing new here , but it's well executed. In the end it's one of those rare satisfying sequels. I give it 8/10.

    This follow-up to the brilliant Die Hard could have been so much more. But once a British Airways plane had been crashed into the ground and 400-odd people had died, no victory of McClaine's could seem remotely satisfying. This moment may well be the biggest murder scene of the whole 80's/90's action film genre and gives the film one of the highest body counts of it. The film has all the elements of a great hero/action movie but a rather hollow feel to the whole adventure. It's as if a list was made of what made Die Hard great and at least two of everything shoved into this script. If you don't get to see it, you might not be heartbroken.

    If you can swallow the preposterous notion that 'the same s**t can happen to the same guy twice' then the chances are that you'll have a great time with this explosive, big-budget sequel by Finnish film-maker Renny Harlin. A man clearly at home working in a cold environment, Harlin makes the most of his sub-zero Dulles Airport backdrop, delivering a frozen flurry of knuckle-bruising, bullet-riddled scenes of mayhem guaranteed to give avid action fans goosebumps. Bruce Willis, reprising his role as tough NY cop John McClane, effortlessly smirks his way through countless bloody gunfights and brutal smack downs against a team of highly trained mercenaries trying to free a deposed dictator/drugs baron (played by cult Euro actor Franco Nero), making this one even more violent than it's predecessor (icicle in the eyeyowch!). Although the plot lacks the purity of the original, and William Sadler's Col. Stuart can't hold a candle to Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber for sheer villainy, Die Hard 2 is still one hell of an enjoyable action flick.

    Of the five Die Hard movies this is my least favorite. Don't get me wrong it is still a great movie. It is the return of one of the best action characters of the second half of the 20th Century... John McClane. Bruce Willis his role as John McClane, a police detective in the right place at the wrong time. This time he goes up against ex-military mercenaries in an airport. The mercenaries are trying to help in the escape of Ramon Esperanza, a general from the Republic of Val Verde, who is being extradited to the U.S. to stand trial for drug trafficking. McClane is, again, trying to save his wife who is on a plane in the skies above Dulles International Airport. Again the action starts out slow, but picks up as soon as John McClane gets involved in the action. He runs all over the airport in his quest to save his wife. John is thwarted several times along the way. One poignant scene is of McClane trying to avert a plane crash of a British Airways flight. He makes makeshift torches and runs out on the tarmac to signal to the plane that they are in danger. McClane is unsuccessful as the British Airways flight crashes into the runway killing all aboard. This shows the futility of the situation McClane finds himself in, but he doesn't give up. Quit just isn't in McClane's make-up. There are three parts of the movie I like the best. The first is when Richard Thornburg (played by William Atherton) is in the lavatory on the same plane as Holly McClane (played by Bonnie Bedelia). Thornburg is in the lavatory on the phone giving an account of the terrorist situation to the news station he works for; Holly uses the tazer of the lady next to her and breaks into the lavatory where she zaps Thornburg. The next favorite scene is when McClane is trying to save the British Airways flight. My third favorite scene is when McClane figures out a specific piece of information and brings it to the attention of Captain Carmine Lorenzo (played by Dennis Franz), of the Dulles Airport Police Department. Lorenzo, in his inexhaustible fashion, doesn't believe McClane. McClane takes his evidence, a machine gun, and proceeds to empty the clip at Lorenzo. The bullets in the machine gun are blanks. Even though this is not one of my favorite Die Hard movies I still rate it an 8 out of 10 stars.

    Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a good sequel as it contains great action, a good villain, and Bruce Willis at its best. The only problem is that it is unoriginal with the same premise as the first in many ways. John McClane is waiting for his wife's plane to land, but when in the airport, the tower is hijacked by terrorists and the planes cannot land as they loose contact with Dulles Tower and can't see the runway. John McClane must now do what he did last time, stop the terrorists and save his wife from sudden death. The film copies the same formula that worked well for the first, a terrorist group keeps hostages and Holly being one of them and John must then save same from death. One of the funny things though in the movie is at two points there is a line where they state how this has happened to them again so at least they admit it. One thing that helped drive the first and helps with this one is its villain. Colonel Stuart is a very good villain, no Hans Gruber, but a good one and the add a twist in this one as there is another military commander working for them which messes up things later in the movie. The movie still relies heavily on its action and it doesn't disappointment with bullets flying, explosions all around, tense fight scenes and a good climax. Die Hard 2 should not disappoint and is a fine addition to a new series. Grade: B+

    This film is your classic popcorn film. You sit down with your popcorn and before you know it the film has taken you on its ride. The next thing you realise is the films over and your popcorn's finished and you want to watch it again! MORE MORE! your thinking. You don't need to watch the 1st film to understand whats going on. This is as good if not better then the first, i cant decide. Its story line isn't complicated. It does everything you expect and want. Action, Comedy and Action! The idea is not to sit down and review the hell out of this sort of film but enjoy it.

    Die Hard 2 isn't as good as the first, but still makes for a most enjoyable action movie, with stupendous, far-fetched escapades ensuring constant thrills. This sees yet another crisis for John McClane, this time at Dulles International Airport. One of the main reasons it works is having a normal guy like John McClane thrust into absurd situations, and McClane often comments on not only the scrapes he's getting into, but his disbelief that he's faced with yet another terrorist scenario after the events of the first film. The constant referencing does get annoying after awhile though - it wasn't really necessary to remind us of it throughout the film, all the way to the end.
