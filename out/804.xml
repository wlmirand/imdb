He becomes a vigilante crime-fighter, aided by his sidekick William, who has suffered a head wound and has problems with short-term memory.

    The film is now 16 years old; perhaps writing a review isn't important. Yet, because of the sincerity of Pesci's character, and the development of a purpose for his life, and his willingness to abide Christian Slater's "slow" character, we gain appreciation for Mr. Pesci personally. He does not falter in his faithfulness to his lady-friend, even though a younger Hawaiian lady comes his way and they get "liquored up" together. Anyone who has had items stolen and yet received no favorable police-work outcome will agree with the character's frustration over theft of the car stereo and decision to make public the facts of local crime. All the sideshow techniques by "Jerico" as they escalate demonstrates the insatiable progressive desire of the public for increase in excitement over just about anything. Pesci understood Hollywood, its deterioration, its aberration and yet he loves it still. He lost his Hollywood star count on Richard Widmark who, in some ways, is as serious a role portrayer as Mr. Pesci is here. The scene where the advertisement on the bus bench has been graffiti-ed is poignant, as is the concluding scene where the portable TV battery is running low, just as the prospects of the SOS is also about deflated. I don't advocate vigilantism, but the process of getting new police chiefs takes years, doesn't it?

    Let me start by saying I was born in Hollywood, California and I have lived in Los Angeles all of my life thus far. In my childhood I would watch movies and hear about "Hollywood" in all its magic and glory and wonder, are we thinking about the same Hollywood? Are they SURE its the one I live in? Hollywood has always been home to me, but a home with a lot of putrescence and perversion. Yet in all its filth, and believe me it is FILTHY, I still love it...I love the movies and I believe that Hollywood was once magical, was once a place like no other. And sometimes if you block out the bothersome aspects of Hollywood, it still is. Jimmy Alto's and William's idealism in trying to make a difference in a city they love is something I immediately related to and deeply appreciated. I love Christian Slater as William; he is such a strange but sweet character, so pleasantly lost, and Slater's portrayal is delightful. For anyone who loves Hollywood, and movies in general, this film is a must.

    Director Barry Levinson would have done well to heed the old line that if you are going to go up to the bell, ring it. Levinson flirts many times with themes much larger than this small film, but he never stays with them. The vapidity of celebrity, the seedy death of Hollywood, even indications of the descent into madness all are brought up but are not followed through. And flashes of brilliance throughout the film are forgotten as the credits roll because of the cheap Hollywood ending. Levinson certainly had a capable cast. Joe Pesci, Victoria Abril (in a rare English-first roll), and an astonishingly effective performance by Christian Slater are wasted as this film runs from theme to theme but never focuses long enough to flesh out the thoughts. Even the comedy becomes sporadic in the latter half of the film. This is worth a rental just to see how a potentially good movie about Hollywood is damaged by its conventions.

    I just watched this movie and was delighted with all the characters. Pesci was not his usual hyper-character(which he does well)but somewhat subdued. At the same time being pushed by his hope of getting "the role" that has always eluded him. Finally, he finds it in reality.The ending was great! I never even heard of this movie before. I am glad I caught it and would recommend it.It made me laugh and made me feel sad also. At the end it did remind me of "The King of Comedy." Maybe not as well written but it kept me watching and grinning as well as feeling a bit nostalgic for the old Hollywood. Especially when 'Jimmy' and "Lorraine" were at Errol Flynns old house as they danced to the sounds of urban chaos.

    This is the type of movie actors appear in when they're trying to revive their dead in the water "career". Something Joe Pesci and Christian Slater should not have to resort to. Pesci and Slater are outstanding actors and should have known better than to accept these roles. This film takes away from their real talent. The script is too reminiscent of Slaters' film "Pump Up the Volume." I was grateful to see this film for free on local television rather than renting it or God forbid, paying to sit in a theater with no hope of escape. If IMDb doesn't like these type of reviews- then maybe they shouldn't have this option available -after reading guidelines-.

    If you have ever lived in LA, you may have started to wonder what ever happened to the Hollywood of glamour, romance and dreams. This movie takes on that question, and with a dynamite duo of Joe Pesci and Victoria Abril doing the honors (Christian Slater is there too, but his part is that of a spaced-out guy, so he does not have too much to add). Its funny, visually interesting, the plot moves along at a good clip, and it has lots of nice small touches. I definitely think it is worth your while, if you have ever lived in LA, or visited Hollywood, or had that sinking feeling of driving through the intersection of Hollywood and Vine. Victoria Abril is terrific and Joe Pesci is relentless, and hilarious with his blond hair.

    This movie was, to me, a teen generally interested and amused by movies like "Bill & Ted" and "Waynes World", trying too hard. It's not the fault of the actors and actresses (Victoria Abril was adorable, I got attatched to her character), but more the writers. This was supposed to be a comedy/drama and it turned out to be more of a strained drama with Joe Pesci. His character was loud mouthed, and rude, but sometimes a good, loyal friend would poke through. Like when he interacted with William (Christian Slater), his spaced out friend suffering from head trauma and anxiety due to an accident we never really learn much about. Christian Slater's performance kept me watching the movie - he was very passive in this, and was very unlike his usual roles. I really like his William. He played it very well - I almost forgot I was watching Christian Slater, which is a sign of good acting. I would see this movie if you were a die-hard Christian Slater fan, but otherwise, don't bother.

    My friend and I went out to see this movie and I never thought I'd fall asleep during a Joe Pesi movie but this was one of those times. This movie was so boring, and so pointless. It had no plot or story that I remember. By the time the movie ended I could hardly keep my head up. Nearing the end of the movie I was yawning and almost ready to fall asleep. My friend asked me if I wanted to leave the theater and I said "no let's wait until the end." I'm sorry I waited so long to leave. Don't waste your time with this movie because I'm sorry I didn't get out of the theater when I had the chance to.

    I admire Barry Levinson's work very much, he's done some great movies and when "Jimmy Hollywood" was airing in my TV, I thought, remembering a complete turkey which was "Bandits" (with Willis and Thornton, directed by Levinson) that this buddy-movie won't be better and I was totally, positively disappointed. Most simple is to say, that it's a one man-show by Joe Pesci, who simply IS Jimmy Alto, a "wanna-be" actor, who continuously looking for his chance in the film capitol of the World-Hollywood. The movie is funny, well-written, good-feeling, has great acting and... cameo of one of the biggest stars of today's cinema at the end. I was very surprised by Christian Slater's role, who always plays dynamic characters, and here it's a complete opposite performance. Also Victoria Abril, known from Almodovar movies, gives here very good acting as Pesci's fiancee. If you saw the poster to this movie, I can only tell that the movie is as COOL as Pesci and Slater cool-looking while sunbathing at the pool. I just can't imagine, how such great movie could earn only $3,6 mlns!!! That's a shame for american audience. I recommend it for everyone who searches for some intelligent entertainment and for all Joe Pesci fans.

    There is so much content on this, it is just a shame such few people have seen it. It is brilliant, funny, sometimes sad and deep, but overall a story full of quotations. Joe Pesci is even greater than the usual, never mind the long blond hair. There is an astonishingly funny performance given by Christian Slater, to me his most impressive ever. Search for it everywhere you can and see for yourself.
