    "Cliffhanger" is quite underrated action movie . It's a mix between "The Eiger Sanction" and "Die hard" . I think that from all "Die hard" clones this is the best one. It's refreshing to see an action movie set in mountains . It allowed the filmmakers for some nice ideas and a breathtaking views. This is Stallone's finest performance along with the "Rocky" and "Rambo" series. He fits his character  Gabe , a mountain rescuer with troubled past  perfectly . He's character isn't a ex-marine , ex-soldier or cop , but a normal human . That's what makes it interesting to watch how will he be able to defeat the bad guys. He's got solid support from Michael Rooker (Hal) and Janine Turner (Jesse). John Lithgow is great as the cold blooded leader of bandits  Quialan. This movie and "Ricochet" proves that comedy actors can give a great serious performance , only if somebody needs to give them a chance. The best scene of the movie happens at the beginning . It always makes hair on my back stand up. It's a really thrilling scene that takes audience by surprise , because we were expecting a different end to it. I also have to mention the final showdown between Stallone , Lithgow and the helicopter. "Cliffhanger" is directed with professionalism by Renny Harlin ("Die hard 2") . The screenplay offers some nice laughs and twists. The whole movie is photographed well and looks good , even if sometimes it's obvious that some scenes were filmed in studio. Also you have to suspend your belief few times ( the unrealistic destruction of airplane , Stallone not freezing to death despite wearing almost nothing) , but after all this is an action movie. "Cliffhanger" should be rated higher. I give it 8/10.

    True to its Title, a lot of folks do hang from a lot of cliffs, and they also hang from other things as well. Ropes, bridges, helicopters, trees, ladders, and credibility also hangs in the balance. This type of thing can be charm- fully exciting, Wow-Cool stuff. This one delivers quite a bit of that. But somehow nothing seems to work very well. The broad expanse of the landscape is beautifully shot but adds little to the menace. It is more breathtaking than, well, breathtaking in a suspenseful kinda way. The Villain, is usually a diabolical genius in the Genre, but here he is so stilted and unannotated (maybe he was freezing) that John Lithgow's usually creepy self is reduced to playing Second-Psycho to His Gang of the more Psychopathic. The Star and the Director have done much better Work elsewhere and go through the mountains motionless and everyone on the "set" seems surprisingly uninspired. In the end it is mildly entertaining and worth a view, but there are so many Action Movies that are better, that this one can only be considered lost in the Wilderness of its contemporaries.

    I had planned, as part of my plan for my 500th review, to watch one of the all-time iconic pictures - "Casablanca" - but in the event, I wasn't in the mood. I needed something brainless to cheer me up and figured that a Stallone pic would do the trick. I know, I shouldn't have expected to be as entertained or enriched as I might have been with Bogie and the others but sometimes, you just need to disengage the brain and settle down to watch fancy stunts, excessively macho fight sequences, cheesy one-liners and ridiculously silly plots. And this film delivered exactly what I ordered and for once, it was a relief to watch a Stallone film without that nagging sense of cheapness that normally accompanies such outings. Sly plays Gabe, a rugged member of a small mountain rescue team who's struggling with guilt after failing to save his best friend Hal's (Michael Rooker) girlfriend. A year later and Gabe returns to the area in order to win over his old flame and fellow colleague Jessie (Janine Turner) but is interrupted by a distress call. Deciding to conquer his demons, Gabe joins up with Hal in order to locate and rescue some hikers trapped by a fast-approaching storm. But the distress call is actually an attempt by professional criminals, led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow), to recover three missing suitcases filled with stolen money and escape the mountain using Hal and Gabe as their guides... Although it is a much better film than this, "Cliffhanger" is rather reminiscent of another Nineties action blockbuster with a daft plot, "Speed" in that it balances ludicrous plotting with some half-decent action. The film is amazingly shot with some stunning scenery and pretty physical action amid the peaks and precarious drops. The plot, however, is as clearly nonsensical as some of the action scenes (I love the fact that Gabe will climb sheer cliffs in his shoes, despite the fact he has crampons in his shoulder-mounted tool-kit!) and Lithgow, as the lead baddie, is frankly hilarious as he hams it up with his dodgy English accent. Stallone, to his credit, gives the role a fair game and most of the stunt work looks pretty good too. So it ticks all the technical boxes for an all-out action pic - it's stupid, predictable and laden with impossible plot contrivances and action sequences. All I wanted was a bit more thought behind it. And yet... despite the flaws, there is something else that is harder to measure. It isn't your regular action movie - gun play is kept to a minimum and the mountain setting offers something different to the thousands of identikit action pics out there. "Cliffhanger" doesn't pretend to be anything other than your boys-night-in rental offering, a heady cocktail of stunt-work and machismo without anything much to really think about like plot points. In short, it delivers precisely what you expect it to but without that usual sense of being short-changed watching a Stallone pic. Normally, I find myself wishing I could watch a Schwarzenegger film instead of whatever Sly flick is showing but not so this time. And while it may not become as iconic as "Casablanca", it's still a great action movie that fans of the genre would appreciate.

    Holds up pretty damn well after 20 years. "Cliffhanger" typifies the big dumb action movies of the '90s, and for this, it makes no apologies. The good news here is that it's quite effective at what it sets out to do. It's "'Die Hard' on a Mountain", pitting Stallone's rock jock against a group of international thieves as they journey to recover their money in the Rocky mountains. And the henchmen are all a bunch of assholes, of the "I-can't-wait-til-Stallone-kills-you" variety (complete with a terrible performance from Rex Linn), while the movie is easily stolen by stone-cold John Lithgow. Lithgow's villain is one of the genre's greatest, possessing the quiet menace and pithy asides that just endear him to the audience. But he's not just posturing for the camera, he's taking a stock role (albeit one with delightful one-liners) and truly making it his own. He's got the smarts, the master plan and the ruthless edge that makes him a match for the muscle-bound hero. The stuntwork in this movie is insane and, when combined with the gorgeous scenery, makes for some incredible visuals. Not to mention the huge action set pieces including the high-flying leaps, explosions, plane hijackings and Michael Rooker's constantly on the receiving end of brutal ass-kickings. I was mildly shocked by just how violent "Cliffhanger" was for '93; they spared no expense on bloody carnage. It is indeed thrilling, helped no doubt by the suspenseful ending. And that opening is still a punch to the gut. Not up there with "Die Hard", but nonetheless a great action film (making for a one-two Stallone punch along with "Demolition Man"). 8/10

    Cliffhanger is an action-adventure thriller that features Sylvester Stallone and John Lithgow together with Michael Rooker,Janine Turner,Leon Robinson,Paul Winfield and Ralph Waite.Stallone plays Gabe Walker, a member of a mountain-climbing rescue team who is haunted by an incident from his past when he couldn't save the girlfriend of his best friend, Hal Tucker,from falling to her death.It was directed by Renny Harlin. Gabe has left mountain-climbing rescue work and has set up business in Denver. He returns to the mountain rescue office to persuade his lover, Jessie to quit and come back to Denver with him. While he is begging Jessie to head out to Denver, things are happening in the skies overhead. A gang of professional crooks headed by psychotic Eric Qualen has hijacked a U.S. Treasury plane carrying millions of dollars. But the plane crashes, and the bad guys find themselves stranded on top of a mountain with the money that was placed into three cases scattered around the wreckage and with no way to get down off the pinnacle to retrieve the cases. They put in a phony distress call that is received by the mountain rescue team. Gabe agrees to take part in one last rescue attempt, and they head up to help rescue the thieves. But Qualen has plans for the rescuers to force them to climb through the dangerous snow-covered peaks to find the three suitcases of cash. Cliffhanger is a device to entertain us, and it works, especially during those moments when Stallone is hanging by his fingernails over a three- mile fall, and the bad guys are stomping on him.Also,it is a big-scale action adventure with plenty of blood and blasts. It resembles some Shakespeare plays only in that by the end of the story almost all the characters are laying in pools of blood.Finally,it may go down in screen history as the nail in the coffin of the Die Hard sub-genre, in which all the key elements of that blockbuster have been recycled to the point of self-parody.

    Rock climbing was the fad of the time, and this and another movie "K2" appeared around the same time. They really did a seamless job of going from studio shots to on the location shots. The cliffhanger scenes were really realistic. This movie has one of the best opening scenes of any movie made. The mistake perhaps was that they didn't keep going with this flow. As soon as the scene changed to the plane crash scene, it lost some of the momentum, then it was down hill from there. The movie basically makes super human hero out of Sylvester Stallone, but he really fits the bill. He had the right flamboyant attitude as the hero too. Then he carries the guilt which really wasn't his fault. They should have just went on with the flamboyant attitude, and it would have been even better. I liked the scene where Stallone climbs up the snow covered rock face in a T shirt (this of course is totally preposterous in real life). Very cool. Seriously, this movie had some of the best Silvester Stallone moments, and I wished they'd make more movies like this of his.

    Anything that Stallone did in the 80's and 90's was "so bad it's good", but this one is simply spectacular on epic scale! Stallone doesn't have a clue about acting (and he couldn't have), but he's trying so hard, God bless him... The icing on the cake here is John Lithgow, none other than the master of the "over-the-top acting", whose fake British accent only adds up to the camp. Magnificent alpine landscapes make a perfect setting, and the pace is alert indeed, with some of the most spectacular stunts and action sequences ever filmed. Bad characters are really evil (and extremely funny, I might add), the good guys are really good and brave and have super-human strength (Stallone is climbing mountain walls bare-handed in the blizzard, wearing just a T-shirt), the one-liners are on the same epic scale as the breath-taking scenery, and of course "Cliffhanger" has dialogue so dumb it's unintentionally hilarious. The plot is laughable, just as much as everything else in this movie, but never mind This is what we call "mindless entertainment" of the best kind. I thoroughly enjoyed this masterpiece, it's great comedy. I dare you not to laugh out loud at the preposterousness of it all.

    Sylvester Stallone is in Haunted Hero mode in this slam bang bit of escapism, playing Gabe Walker, a mountain rescue expert who in the movie's opening set piece is unable to stop a climber from meeting their doom. Racked with guilt, he spends some time away before returning to his old haunt to ask girlfriend Jessie (Janine Turner) to come away with him. This coincides with the actions of some ruthless airborne criminals who have purloined international currency from the Treasury Department. These people are led by John Lithgow as Eric Qualen, and Lithgow here shows he definitely has what it takes as an action movie villain. He truly is a cold blooded and nasty s.o.b. Director Renny Harlin proves once again to be a master of the large scale action film, keeping the pace going through one riveting sequence after another. "Cliffhanger" is the kind of movie where even at a hefty enough running time (1 Hour 53 minutes in this case) the time just flies by. Of course, this is due in no small part to the incredible setting. The Dolomite mountains of Italy stand in for the American Rockies, where the story is set. All of this natural grandeur really takes ones' breath away, and the sense of being at dizzying heights is extremely palpable. This is white knuckle stuff all the way. Taking away a little from some of the enjoyment are some stupid and annoying characters doing stupid and annoying things, but then, this movie is hardly unique in the world of film when it comes to that element. The bad guys, also including Rex Linn ('C.S.I.: Miami'), Caroline Goodall, Leon, Gregory Scott Cummins, Craig Fairbrass, and Denis Forest, are largely the kind of scum where you have a high old time just aching for their demise. And on the other side, the good guys are all likable enough, with Stallone showing again how he can be under appreciated as an actor; old pro Ralph Waite is delightful as Frank, and Michael Rooker is aces as Gabes' friend and fellow climber who's spent some time resenting him for that failed rescue attempt at the beginning of the movie. Other familiar faces lend a welcome presence: Max Perlich, Zach Grenier, Vyto Ruginis, Don S. Davis, John Finn, Bruce McGill, and the always solid Paul Winfield. Soaring music by Trevor Jones and excellent cinematography by Alex Thomson add to the enjoyment. This is genuinely exciting and suspenseful stuff that reels you in right from the start and keeps you watching the whole time. It's one of Sly's best ever vehicles. Eight out of 10.

    Cliffhanger is an action-adventure thriller that features Sylvester Stallone and John Lithgow together with Michael Rooker,Janine Turner,Leon Robinson,Paul Winfield and Ralph Waite.Stallone plays Gabe Walker, a member of a mountain-climbing rescue team who is haunted by an incident from his past when he couldn't save the girlfriend of his best friend, Hal Tucker,from falling to her death.It was directed by Renny Harlin. Gabe has left mountain-climbing rescue work and has set up business in Denver. He returns to the mountain rescue office to persuade his lover, Jessie to quit and come back to Denver with him. While he is begging Jessie to head out to Denver, things are happening in the skies overhead. A gang of professional crooks headed by psychotic Eric Qualen has hijacked a U.S. Treasury plane carrying millions of dollars. But the plane crashes, and the bad guys find themselves stranded on top of a mountain with the money that was placed into three cases scattered around the wreckage and with no way to get down off the pinnacle to retrieve the cases. They put in a phony distress call that is received by the mountain rescue team. Gabe agrees to take part in one last rescue attempt, and they head up to help rescue the thieves. But Qualen has plans for the rescuers to force them to climb through the dangerous snow-covered peaks to find the three suitcases of cash. Cliffhanger is a device to entertain us, and it works, especially during those moments when Stallone is hanging by his fingernails over a three- mile fall, and the bad guys are stomping on him.Also,it is a big-scale action adventure with plenty of blood and blasts. It resembles some Shakespeare plays only in that by the end of the story almost all the characters are laying in pools of blood.Finally,it may go down in screen history as the nail in the coffin of the Die Hard sub-genre, in which all the key elements of that blockbuster have been recycled to the point of self-parody.

    Rock climbing was the fad of the time, and this and another movie "K2" appeared around the same time. They really did a seamless job of going from studio shots to on the location shots. The cliffhanger scenes were really realistic. This movie has one of the best opening scenes of any movie made. The mistake perhaps was that they didn't keep going with this flow. As soon as the scene changed to the plane crash scene, it lost some of the momentum, then it was down hill from there. The movie basically makes super human hero out of Sylvester Stallone, but he really fits the bill. He had the right flamboyant attitude as the hero too. Then he carries the guilt which really wasn't his fault. They should have just went on with the flamboyant attitude, and it would have been even better. I liked the scene where Stallone climbs up the snow covered rock face in a T shirt (this of course is totally preposterous in real life). Very cool. Seriously, this movie had some of the best Silvester Stallone moments, and I wished they'd make more movies like this of his.

    Anything that Stallone did in the 80's and 90's was "so bad it's good", but this one is simply spectacular on epic scale! Stallone doesn't have a clue about acting (and he couldn't have), but he's trying so hard, God bless him... The icing on the cake here is John Lithgow, none other than the master of the "over-the-top acting", whose fake British accent only adds up to the camp. Magnificent alpine landscapes make a perfect setting, and the pace is alert indeed, with some of the most spectacular stunts and action sequences ever filmed. Bad characters are really evil (and extremely funny, I might add), the good guys are really good and brave and have super-human strength (Stallone is climbing mountain walls bare-handed in the blizzard, wearing just a T-shirt), the one-liners are on the same epic scale as the breath-taking scenery, and of course "Cliffhanger" has dialogue so dumb it's unintentionally hilarious. The plot is laughable, just as much as everything else in this movie, but never mind This is what we call "mindless entertainment" of the best kind. I thoroughly enjoyed this masterpiece, it's great comedy. I dare you not to laugh out loud at the preposterousness of it all.

    Sylvester Stallone is in Haunted Hero mode in this slam bang bit of escapism, playing Gabe Walker, a mountain rescue expert who in the movie's opening set piece is unable to stop a climber from meeting their doom. Racked with guilt, he spends some time away before returning to his old haunt to ask girlfriend Jessie (Janine Turner) to come away with him. This coincides with the actions of some ruthless airborne criminals who have purloined international currency from the Treasury Department. These people are led by John Lithgow as Eric Qualen, and Lithgow here shows he definitely has what it takes as an action movie villain. He truly is a cold blooded and nasty s.o.b. Director Renny Harlin proves once again to be a master of the large scale action film, keeping the pace going through one riveting sequence after another. "Cliffhanger" is the kind of movie where even at a hefty enough running time (1 Hour 53 minutes in this case) the time just flies by. Of course, this is due in no small part to the incredible setting. The Dolomite mountains of Italy stand in for the American Rockies, where the story is set. All of this natural grandeur really takes ones' breath away, and the sense of being at dizzying heights is extremely palpable. This is white knuckle stuff all the way. Taking away a little from some of the enjoyment are some stupid and annoying characters doing stupid and annoying things, but then, this movie is hardly unique in the world of film when it comes to that element. The bad guys, also including Rex Linn ('C.S.I.: Miami'), Caroline Goodall, Leon, Gregory Scott Cummins, Craig Fairbrass, and Denis Forest, are largely the kind of scum where you have a high old time just aching for their demise. And on the other side, the good guys are all likable enough, with Stallone showing again how he can be under appreciated as an actor; old pro Ralph Waite is delightful as Frank, and Michael Rooker is aces as Gabes' friend and fellow climber who's spent some time resenting him for that failed rescue attempt at the beginning of the movie. Other familiar faces lend a welcome presence: Max Perlich, Zach Grenier, Vyto Ruginis, Don S. Davis, John Finn, Bruce McGill, and the always solid Paul Winfield. Soaring music by Trevor Jones and excellent cinematography by Alex Thomson add to the enjoyment. This is genuinely exciting and suspenseful stuff that reels you in right from the start and keeps you watching the whole time. It's one of Sly's best ever vehicles. Eight out of 10.

    "Cliffhanger" is quite underrated action movie . It's a mix between "The Eiger Sanction" and "Die hard" . I think that from all "Die hard" clones this is the best one. It's refreshing to see an action movie set in mountains . It allowed the filmmakers for some nice ideas and a breathtaking views. This is Stallone's finest performance along with the "Rocky" and "Rambo" series. He fits his character  Gabe , a mountain rescuer with troubled past  perfectly . He's character isn't a ex-marine , ex-soldier or cop , but a normal human . That's what makes it interesting to watch how will he be able to defeat the bad guys. He's got solid support from Michael Rooker (Hal) and Janine Turner (Jesse). John Lithgow is great as the cold blooded leader of bandits  Quialan. This movie and "Ricochet" proves that comedy actors can give a great serious performance , only if somebody needs to give them a chance. The best scene of the movie happens at the beginning . It always makes hair on my back stand up. It's a really thrilling scene that takes audience by surprise , because we were expecting a different end to it. I also have to mention the final showdown between Stallone , Lithgow and the helicopter. "Cliffhanger" is directed with professionalism by Renny Harlin ("Die hard 2") . The screenplay offers some nice laughs and twists. The whole movie is photographed well and looks good , even if sometimes it's obvious that some scenes were filmed in studio. Also you have to suspend your belief few times ( the unrealistic destruction of airplane , Stallone not freezing to death despite wearing almost nothing) , but after all this is an action movie. "Cliffhanger" should be rated higher. I give it 8/10.

    True to its Title, a lot of folks do hang from a lot of cliffs, and they also hang from other things as well. Ropes, bridges, helicopters, trees, ladders, and credibility also hangs in the balance. This type of thing can be charm- fully exciting, Wow-Cool stuff. This one delivers quite a bit of that. But somehow nothing seems to work very well. The broad expanse of the landscape is beautifully shot but adds little to the menace. It is more breathtaking than, well, breathtaking in a suspenseful kinda way. The Villain, is usually a diabolical genius in the Genre, but here he is so stilted and unannotated (maybe he was freezing) that John Lithgow's usually creepy self is reduced to playing Second-Psycho to His Gang of the more Psychopathic. The Star and the Director have done much better Work elsewhere and go through the mountains motionless and everyone on the "set" seems surprisingly uninspired. In the end it is mildly entertaining and worth a view, but there are so many Action Movies that are better, that this one can only be considered lost in the Wilderness of its contemporaries.

    I had planned, as part of my plan for my 500th review, to watch one of the all-time iconic pictures - "Casablanca" - but in the event, I wasn't in the mood. I needed something brainless to cheer me up and figured that a Stallone pic would do the trick. I know, I shouldn't have expected to be as entertained or enriched as I might have been with Bogie and the others but sometimes, you just need to disengage the brain and settle down to watch fancy stunts, excessively macho fight sequences, cheesy one-liners and ridiculously silly plots. And this film delivered exactly what I ordered and for once, it was a relief to watch a Stallone film without that nagging sense of cheapness that normally accompanies such outings. Sly plays Gabe, a rugged member of a small mountain rescue team who's struggling with guilt after failing to save his best friend Hal's (Michael Rooker) girlfriend. A year later and Gabe returns to the area in order to win over his old flame and fellow colleague Jessie (Janine Turner) but is interrupted by a distress call. Deciding to conquer his demons, Gabe joins up with Hal in order to locate and rescue some hikers trapped by a fast-approaching storm. But the distress call is actually an attempt by professional criminals, led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow), to recover three missing suitcases filled with stolen money and escape the mountain using Hal and Gabe as their guides... Although it is a much better film than this, "Cliffhanger" is rather reminiscent of another Nineties action blockbuster with a daft plot, "Speed" in that it balances ludicrous plotting with some half-decent action. The film is amazingly shot with some stunning scenery and pretty physical action amid the peaks and precarious drops. The plot, however, is as clearly nonsensical as some of the action scenes (I love the fact that Gabe will climb sheer cliffs in his shoes, despite the fact he has crampons in his shoulder-mounted tool-kit!) and Lithgow, as the lead baddie, is frankly hilarious as he hams it up with his dodgy English accent. Stallone, to his credit, gives the role a fair game and most of the stunt work looks pretty good too. So it ticks all the technical boxes for an all-out action pic - it's stupid, predictable and laden with impossible plot contrivances and action sequences. All I wanted was a bit more thought behind it. And yet... despite the flaws, there is something else that is harder to measure. It isn't your regular action movie - gun play is kept to a minimum and the mountain setting offers something different to the thousands of identikit action pics out there. "Cliffhanger" doesn't pretend to be anything other than your boys-night-in rental offering, a heady cocktail of stunt-work and machismo without anything much to really think about like plot points. In short, it delivers precisely what you expect it to but without that usual sense of being short-changed watching a Stallone pic. Normally, I find myself wishing I could watch a Schwarzenegger film instead of whatever Sly flick is showing but not so this time. And while it may not become as iconic as "Casablanca", it's still a great action movie that fans of the genre would appreciate.

    Holds up pretty damn well after 20 years. "Cliffhanger" typifies the big dumb action movies of the '90s, and for this, it makes no apologies. The good news here is that it's quite effective at what it sets out to do. It's "'Die Hard' on a Mountain", pitting Stallone's rock jock against a group of international thieves as they journey to recover their money in the Rocky mountains. And the henchmen are all a bunch of assholes, of the "I-can't-wait-til-Stallone-kills-you" variety (complete with a terrible performance from Rex Linn), while the movie is easily stolen by stone-cold John Lithgow. Lithgow's villain is one of the genre's greatest, possessing the quiet menace and pithy asides that just endear him to the audience. But he's not just posturing for the camera, he's taking a stock role (albeit one with delightful one-liners) and truly making it his own. He's got the smarts, the master plan and the ruthless edge that makes him a match for the muscle-bound hero. The stuntwork in this movie is insane and, when combined with the gorgeous scenery, makes for some incredible visuals. Not to mention the huge action set pieces including the high-flying leaps, explosions, plane hijackings and Michael Rooker's constantly on the receiving end of brutal ass-kickings. I was mildly shocked by just how violent "Cliffhanger" was for '93; they spared no expense on bloody carnage. It is indeed thrilling, helped no doubt by the suspenseful ending. And that opening is still a punch to the gut. Not up there with "Die Hard", but nonetheless a great action film (making for a one-two Stallone punch along with "Demolition Man"). 8/10

But the distress call is actually an attempt by professional criminals, led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow), to recover three missing suitcases filled with stolen money and escape the mountain using Hal and Gabe as their guides... Although it is a much better film than this, "Cliffhanger" is rather reminiscent of another Nineties action blockbuster with a daft plot, "Speed" in that it balances ludicrous plotting with some half-decent action. The film is amazingly shot with some stunning scenery and pretty physical action amid the peaks and precarious drops. The plot, however, is as clearly nonsensical as some of the action scenes (I love the fact that Gabe will climb sheer cliffs in his shoes, despite the fact he has crampons in his shoulder-mounted tool-kit!) and Lithgow, as the lead baddie, is frankly hilarious as he hams it up with his dodgy English accent. Stallone, to his credit, gives the role a fair game and most of the stunt work looks pretty good too. So it ticks all the technical boxes for an all-out action pic - it's stupid, predictable and laden with impossible plot contrivances and action sequences. All I wanted was a bit more thought behind it. And yet... despite the flaws, there is something else that is harder to measure. It isn't your regular action movie - gun play is kept to a minimum and the mountain setting offers something different to the thousands of identikit action pics out there. "Cliffhanger" doesn't pretend to be anything other than your boys-night-in rental offering, a heady cocktail of stunt-work and machismo without anything much to really think about like plot points. In short, it delivers precisely what you expect it to but without that usual sense of being short-changed watching a Stallone pic. Normally, I find myself wishing I could watch a Schwarzenegger film instead of whatever Sly flick is showing but not so this time. And while it may not become as iconic as "Casablanca", it's still a great action movie that fans of the genre would appreciate.

    Holds up pretty damn well after 20 years. "Cliffhanger" typifies the big dumb action movies of the '90s, and for this, it makes no apologies. The good news here is that it's quite effective at what it sets out to do. It's "'Die Hard' on a Mountain", pitting Stallone's rock jock against a group of international thieves as they journey to recover their money in the Rocky mountains. And the henchmen are all a bunch of assholes, of the "I-can't-wait-til-Stallone-kills-you" variety (complete with a terrible performance from Rex Linn), while the movie is easily stolen by stone-cold John Lithgow. Lithgow's villain is one of the genre's greatest, possessing the quiet menace and pithy asides that just endear him to the audience. But he's not just posturing for the camera, he's taking a stock role (albeit one with delightful one-liners) and truly making it his own. He's got the smarts, the master plan and the ruthless edge that makes him a match for the muscle-bound hero. The stuntwork in this movie is insane and, when combined with the gorgeous scenery, makes for some incredible visuals. Not to mention the huge action set pieces including the high-flying leaps, explosions, plane hijackings and Michael Rooker's constantly on the receiving end of brutal ass-kickings. I was mildly shocked by just how violent "Cliffhanger" was for '93; they spared no expense on bloody carnage. It is indeed thrilling, helped no doubt by the suspenseful ending. And that opening is still a punch to the gut. Not up there with "Die Hard", but nonetheless a great action film (making for a one-two Stallone punch along with "Demolition Man"). 8/10

    Cliffhanger is an action-adventure thriller that features Sylvester Stallone and John Lithgow together with Michael Rooker,Janine Turner,Leon Robinson,Paul Winfield and Ralph Waite.Stallone plays Gabe Walker, a member of a mountain-climbing rescue team who is haunted by an incident from his past when he couldn't save the girlfriend of his best friend, Hal Tucker,from falling to her death.It was directed by Renny Harlin. Gabe has left mountain-climbing rescue work and has set up business in Denver. He returns to the mountain rescue office to persuade his lover, Jessie to quit and come back to Denver with him. While he is begging Jessie to head out to Denver, things are happening in the skies overhead. A gang of professional crooks headed by psychotic Eric Qualen has hijacked a U.S. Treasury plane carrying millions of dollars. But the plane crashes, and the bad guys find themselves stranded on top of a mountain with the money that was placed into three cases scattered around the wreckage and with no way to get down off the pinnacle to retrieve the cases. They put in a phony distress call that is received by the mountain rescue team. Gabe agrees to take part in one last rescue attempt, and they head up to help rescue the thieves. But Qualen has plans for the rescuers to force them to climb through the dangerous snow-covered peaks to find the three suitcases of cash. Cliffhanger is a device to entertain us, and it works, especially during those moments when Stallone is hanging by his fingernails over a three- mile fall, and the bad guys are stomping on him.Also,it is a big-scale action adventure with plenty of blood and blasts. It resembles some Shakespeare plays only in that by the end of the story almost all the characters are laying in pools of blood.Finally,it may go down in screen history as the nail in the coffin of the Die Hard sub-genre, in which all the key elements of that blockbuster have been recycled to the point of self-parody.

    Rock climbing was the fad of the time, and this and another movie "K2" appeared around the same time. They really did a seamless job of going from studio shots to on the location shots. The cliffhanger scenes were really realistic. This movie has one of the best opening scenes of any movie made. The mistake perhaps was that they didn't keep going with this flow. As soon as the scene changed to the plane crash scene, it lost some of the momentum, then it was down hill from there. The movie basically makes super human hero out of Sylvester Stallone, but he really fits the bill. He had the right flamboyant attitude as the hero too. Then he carries the guilt which really wasn't his fault. They should have just went on with the flamboyant attitude, and it would have been even better. I liked the scene where Stallone climbs up the snow covered rock face in a T shirt (this of course is totally preposterous in real life). Very cool. Seriously, this movie had some of the best Silvester Stallone moments, and I wished they'd make more movies like this of his.

    Anything that Stallone did in the 80's and 90's was "so bad it's good", but this one is simply spectacular on epic scale! Stallone doesn't have a clue about acting (and he couldn't have), but he's trying so hard, God bless him... The icing on the cake here is John Lithgow, none other than the master of the "over-the-top acting", whose fake British accent only adds up to the camp. Magnificent alpine landscapes make a perfect setting, and the pace is alert indeed, with some of the most spectacular stunts and action sequences ever filmed. Bad characters are really evil (and extremely funny, I might add), the good guys are really good and brave and have super-human strength (Stallone is climbing mountain walls bare-handed in the blizzard, wearing just a T-shirt), the one-liners are on the same epic scale as the breath-taking scenery, and of course "Cliffhanger" has dialogue so dumb it's unintentionally hilarious. The plot is laughable, just as much as everything else in this movie, but never mind This is what we call "mindless entertainment" of the best kind. I thoroughly enjoyed this masterpiece, it's great comedy. I dare you not to laugh out loud at the preposterousness of it all.

    Sylvester Stallone is in Haunted Hero mode in this slam bang bit of escapism, playing Gabe Walker, a mountain rescue expert who in the movie's opening set piece is unable to stop a climber from meeting their doom. Racked with guilt, he spends some time away before returning to his old haunt to ask girlfriend Jessie (Janine Turner) to come away with him. This coincides with the actions of some ruthless airborne criminals who have purloined international currency from the Treasury Department. These people are led by John Lithgow as Eric Qualen, and Lithgow here shows he definitely has what it takes as an action movie villain. He truly is a cold blooded and nasty s.o.b. Director Renny Harlin proves once again to be a master of the large scale action film, keeping the pace going through one riveting sequence after another. "Cliffhanger" is the kind of movie where even at a hefty enough running time (1 Hour 53 minutes in this case) the time just flies by. Of course, this is due in no small part to the incredible setting. The Dolomite mountains of Italy stand in for the American Rockies, where the story is set. All of this natural grandeur really takes ones' breath away, and the sense of being at dizzying heights is extremely palpable. This is white knuckle stuff all the way. Taking away a little from some of the enjoyment are some stupid and annoying characters doing stupid and annoying things, but then, this movie is hardly unique in the world of film when it comes to that element. The bad guys, also including Rex Linn ('C.S.I.: Miami'), Caroline Goodall, Leon, Gregory Scott Cummins, Craig Fairbrass, and Denis Forest, are largely the kind of scum where you have a high old time just aching for their demise. And on the other side, the good guys are all likable enough, with Stallone showing again how he can be under appreciated as an actor; old pro Ralph Waite is delightful as Frank, and Michael Rooker is aces as Gabes' friend and fellow climber who's spent some time resenting him for that failed rescue attempt at the beginning of the movie. Other familiar faces lend a welcome presence: Max Perlich, Zach Grenier, Vyto Ruginis, Don S. Davis, John Finn, Bruce McGill, and the always solid Paul Winfield. Soaring music by Trevor Jones and excellent cinematography by Alex Thomson add to the enjoyment. This is genuinely exciting and suspenseful stuff that reels you in right from the start and keeps you watching the whole time. It's one of Sly's best ever vehicles. Eight out of 10.

    "Cliffhanger" is quite underrated action movie . It's a mix between "The Eiger Sanction" and "Die hard" . I think that from all "Die hard" clones this is the best one. It's refreshing to see an action movie set in mountains . It allowed the filmmakers for some nice ideas and a breathtaking views. This is Stallone's finest performance along with the "Rocky" and "Rambo" series. He fits his character  Gabe , a mountain rescuer with troubled past  perfectly . He's character isn't a ex-marine , ex-soldier or cop , but a normal human . That's what makes it interesting to watch how will he be able to defeat the bad guys. He's got solid support from Michael Rooker (Hal) and Janine Turner (Jesse). John Lithgow is great as the cold blooded leader of bandits  Quialan. This movie and "Ricochet" proves that comedy actors can give a great serious performance , only if somebody needs to give them a chance. The best scene of the movie happens at the beginning . It always makes hair on my back stand up. It's a really thrilling scene that takes audience by surprise , because we were expecting a different end to it. I also have to mention the final showdown between Stallone , Lithgow and the helicopter. "Cliffhanger" is directed with professionalism by Renny Harlin ("Die hard 2") . The screenplay offers some nice laughs and twists. The whole movie is photographed well and looks good , even if sometimes it's obvious that some scenes were filmed in studio. Also you have to suspend your belief few times ( the unrealistic destruction of airplane , Stallone not freezing to death despite wearing almost nothing) , but after all this is an action movie. "Cliffhanger" should be rated higher. I give it 8/10.

    True to its Title, a lot of folks do hang from a lot of cliffs, and they also hang from other things as well. Ropes, bridges, helicopters, trees, ladders, and credibility also hangs in the balance. This type of thing can be charm- fully exciting, Wow-Cool stuff. This one delivers quite a bit of that. But somehow nothing seems to work very well. The broad expanse of the landscape is beautifully shot but adds little to the menace. It is more breathtaking than, well, breathtaking in a suspenseful kinda way. The Villain, is usually a diabolical genius in the Genre, but here he is so stilted and unannotated (maybe he was freezing) that John Lithgow's usually creepy self is reduced to playing Second-Psycho to His Gang of the more Psychopathic. The Star and the Director have done much better Work elsewhere and go through the mountains motionless and everyone on the "set" seems surprisingly uninspired. In the end it is mildly entertaining and worth a view, but there are so many Action Movies that are better, that this one can only be considered lost in the Wilderness of its contemporaries.

    I had planned, as part of my plan for my 500th review, to watch one of the all-time iconic pictures - "Casablanca" - but in the event, I wasn't in the mood. I needed something brainless to cheer me up and figured that a Stallone pic would do the trick. I know, I shouldn't have expected to be as entertained or enriched as I might have been with Bogie and the others but sometimes, you just need to disengage the brain and settle down to watch fancy stunts, excessively macho fight sequences, cheesy one-liners and ridiculously silly plots. And this film delivered exactly what I ordered and for once, it was a relief to watch a Stallone film without that nagging sense of cheapness that normally accompanies such outings. Sly plays Gabe, a rugged member of a small mountain rescue team who's struggling with guilt after failing to save his best friend Hal's (Michael Rooker) girlfriend. A year later and Gabe returns to the area in order to win over his old flame and fellow colleague Jessie (Janine Turner) but is interrupted by a distress call. Deciding to conquer his demons, Gabe joins up with Hal in order to locate and rescue some hikers trapped by a fast-approaching storm. But the distress call is actually an attempt by professional criminals, led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow), to recover three missing suitcases filled with stolen money and escape the mountain using Hal and Gabe as their guides... Although it is a much better film than this, "Cliffhanger" is rather reminiscent of another Nineties action blockbuster with a daft plot, "Speed" in that it balances ludicrous plotting with some half-decent action. The film is amazingly shot with some stunning scenery and pretty physical action amid the peaks and precarious drops.

This is Stallone's finest performance along with the "Rocky" and "Rambo" series. He fits his character  Gabe , a mountain rescuer with troubled past  perfectly . He's character isn't a ex-marine , ex-soldier or cop , but a normal human . That's what makes it interesting to watch how will he be able to defeat the bad guys. He's got solid support from Michael Rooker (Hal) and Janine Turner (Jesse). John Lithgow is great as the cold blooded leader of bandits  Quialan. This movie and "Ricochet" proves that comedy actors can give a great serious performance , only if somebody needs to give them a chance. The best scene of the movie happens at the beginning . It always makes hair on my back stand up. It's a really thrilling scene that takes audience by surprise , because we were expecting a different end to it. I also have to mention the final showdown between Stallone , Lithgow and the helicopter. "Cliffhanger" is directed with professionalism by Renny Harlin ("Die hard 2") . The screenplay offers some nice laughs and twists. The whole movie is photographed well and looks good , even if sometimes it's obvious that some scenes were filmed in studio. Also you have to suspend your belief few times ( the unrealistic destruction of airplane , Stallone not freezing to death despite wearing almost nothing) , but after all this is an action movie. "Cliffhanger" should be rated higher. I give it 8/10.

    True to its Title, a lot of folks do hang from a lot of cliffs, and they also hang from other things as well. Ropes, bridges, helicopters, trees, ladders, and credibility also hangs in the balance. This type of thing can be charm- fully exciting, Wow-Cool stuff. This one delivers quite a bit of that. But somehow nothing seems to work very well. The broad expanse of the landscape is beautifully shot but adds little to the menace. It is more breathtaking than, well, breathtaking in a suspenseful kinda way. The Villain, is usually a diabolical genius in the Genre, but here he is so stilted and unannotated (maybe he was freezing) that John Lithgow's usually creepy self is reduced to playing Second-Psycho to His Gang of the more Psychopathic. The Star and the Director have done much better Work elsewhere and go through the mountains motionless and everyone on the "set" seems surprisingly uninspired. In the end it is mildly entertaining and worth a view, but there are so many Action Movies that are better, that this one can only be considered lost in the Wilderness of its contemporaries.

    I had planned, as part of my plan for my 500th review, to watch one of the all-time iconic pictures - "Casablanca" - but in the event, I wasn't in the mood. I needed something brainless to cheer me up and figured that a Stallone pic would do the trick. I know, I shouldn't have expected to be as entertained or enriched as I might have been with Bogie and the others but sometimes, you just need to disengage the brain and settle down to watch fancy stunts, excessively macho fight sequences, cheesy one-liners and ridiculously silly plots. And this film delivered exactly what I ordered and for once, it was a relief to watch a Stallone film without that nagging sense of cheapness that normally accompanies such outings. Sly plays Gabe, a rugged member of a small mountain rescue team who's struggling with guilt after failing to save his best friend Hal's (Michael Rooker) girlfriend. A year later and Gabe returns to the area in order to win over his old flame and fellow colleague Jessie (Janine Turner) but is interrupted by a distress call. Deciding to conquer his demons, Gabe joins up with Hal in order to locate and rescue some hikers trapped by a fast-approaching storm. But the distress call is actually an attempt by professional criminals, led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow), to recover three missing suitcases filled with stolen money and escape the mountain using Hal and Gabe as their guides... Although it is a much better film than this, "Cliffhanger" is rather reminiscent of another Nineties action blockbuster with a daft plot, "Speed" in that it balances ludicrous plotting with some half-decent action. The film is amazingly shot with some stunning scenery and pretty physical action amid the peaks and precarious drops. The plot, however, is as clearly nonsensical as some of the action scenes (I love the fact that Gabe will climb sheer cliffs in his shoes, despite the fact he has crampons in his shoulder-mounted tool-kit!) and Lithgow, as the lead baddie, is frankly hilarious as he hams it up with his dodgy English accent. Stallone, to his credit, gives the role a fair game and most of the stunt work looks pretty good too. So it ticks all the technical boxes for an all-out action pic - it's stupid, predictable and laden with impossible plot contrivances and action sequences. All I wanted was a bit more thought behind it. And yet... despite the flaws, there is something else that is harder to measure. It isn't your regular action movie - gun play is kept to a minimum and the mountain setting offers something different to the thousands of identikit action pics out there. "Cliffhanger" doesn't pretend to be anything other than your boys-night-in rental offering, a heady cocktail of stunt-work and machismo without anything much to really think about like plot points. In short, it delivers precisely what you expect it to but without that usual sense of being short-changed watching a Stallone pic. Normally, I find myself wishing I could watch a Schwarzenegger film instead of whatever Sly flick is showing but not so this time. And while it may not become as iconic as "Casablanca", it's still a great action movie that fans of the genre would appreciate.

    Holds up pretty damn well after 20 years. "Cliffhanger" typifies the big dumb action movies of the '90s, and for this, it makes no apologies. The good news here is that it's quite effective at what it sets out to do. It's "'Die Hard' on a Mountain", pitting Stallone's rock jock against a group of international thieves as they journey to recover their money in the Rocky mountains. And the henchmen are all a bunch of assholes, of the "I-can't-wait-til-Stallone-kills-you" variety (complete with a terrible performance from Rex Linn), while the movie is easily stolen by stone-cold John Lithgow. Lithgow's villain is one of the genre's greatest, possessing the quiet menace and pithy asides that just endear him to the audience. But he's not just posturing for the camera, he's taking a stock role (albeit one with delightful one-liners) and truly making it his own. He's got the smarts, the master plan and the ruthless edge that makes him a match for the muscle-bound hero. The stuntwork in this movie is insane and, when combined with the gorgeous scenery, makes for some incredible visuals. Not to mention the huge action set pieces including the high-flying leaps, explosions, plane hijackings and Michael Rooker's constantly on the receiving end of brutal ass-kickings. I was mildly shocked by just how violent "Cliffhanger" was for '93; they spared no expense on bloody carnage. It is indeed thrilling, helped no doubt by the suspenseful ending. And that opening is still a punch to the gut. Not up there with "Die Hard", but nonetheless a great action film (making for a one-two Stallone punch along with "Demolition Man"). 8/10

    Cliffhanger is an action-adventure thriller that features Sylvester Stallone and John Lithgow together with Michael Rooker,Janine Turner,Leon Robinson,Paul Winfield and Ralph Waite.Stallone plays Gabe Walker, a member of a mountain-climbing rescue team who is haunted by an incident from his past when he couldn't save the girlfriend of his best friend, Hal Tucker,from falling to her death.It was directed by Renny Harlin. Gabe has left mountain-climbing rescue work and has set up business in Denver. He returns to the mountain rescue office to persuade his lover, Jessie to quit and come back to Denver with him. While he is begging Jessie to head out to Denver, things are happening in the skies overhead. A gang of professional crooks headed by psychotic Eric Qualen has hijacked a U.S. Treasury plane carrying millions of dollars. But the plane crashes, and the bad guys find themselves stranded on top of a mountain with the money that was placed into three cases scattered around the wreckage and with no way to get down off the pinnacle to retrieve the cases. They put in a phony distress call that is received by the mountain rescue team. Gabe agrees to take part in one last rescue attempt, and they head up to help rescue the thieves. But Qualen has plans for the rescuers to force them to climb through the dangerous snow-covered peaks to find the three suitcases of cash. Cliffhanger is a device to entertain us, and it works, especially during those moments when Stallone is hanging by his fingernails over a three- mile fall, and the bad guys are stomping on him.Also,it is a big-scale action adventure with plenty of blood and blasts. It resembles some Shakespeare plays only in that by the end of the story almost all the characters are laying in pools of blood.Finally,it may go down in screen history as the nail in the coffin of the Die Hard sub-genre, in which all the key elements of that blockbuster have been recycled to the point of self-parody.

    Rock climbing was the fad of the time, and this and another movie "K2" appeared around the same time. They really did a seamless job of going from studio shots to on the location shots. The cliffhanger scenes were really realistic. This movie has one of the best opening scenes of any movie made. The mistake perhaps was that they didn't keep going with this flow. As soon as the scene changed to the plane crash scene, it lost some of the momentum, then it was down hill from there. The movie basically makes super human hero out of Sylvester Stallone, but he really fits the bill. He had the right flamboyant attitude as the hero too. Then he carries the guilt which really wasn't his fault. They should have just went on with the flamboyant attitude, and it would have been even better. I liked the scene where Stallone climbs up the snow covered rock face in a T shirt (this of course is totally preposterous in real life). Very cool. Seriously, this movie had some of the best Silvester Stallone moments, and I wished they'd make more movies like this of his.

    Anything that Stallone did in the 80's and 90's was "so bad it's good", but this one is simply spectacular on epic scale! Stallone doesn't have a clue about acting (and he couldn't have), but he's trying so hard, God bless him... The icing on the cake here is John Lithgow, none other than the master of the "over-the-top acting", whose fake British accent only adds up to the camp. Magnificent alpine landscapes make a perfect setting, and the pace is alert indeed, with some of the most spectacular stunts and action sequences ever filmed. Bad characters are really evil (and extremely funny, I might add), the good guys are really good and brave and have super-human strength (Stallone is climbing mountain walls bare-handed in the blizzard, wearing just a T-shirt), the one-liners are on the same epic scale as the breath-taking scenery, and of course "Cliffhanger" has dialogue so dumb it's unintentionally hilarious. The plot is laughable, just as much as everything else in this movie, but never mind This is what we call "mindless entertainment" of the best kind. I thoroughly enjoyed this masterpiece, it's great comedy. I dare you not to laugh out loud at the preposterousness of it all.

    Sylvester Stallone is in Haunted Hero mode in this slam bang bit of escapism, playing Gabe Walker, a mountain rescue expert who in the movie's opening set piece is unable to stop a climber from meeting their doom. Racked with guilt, he spends some time away before returning to his old haunt to ask girlfriend Jessie (Janine Turner) to come away with him. This coincides with the actions of some ruthless airborne criminals who have purloined international currency from the Treasury Department. These people are led by John Lithgow as Eric Qualen, and Lithgow here shows he definitely has what it takes as an action movie villain. He truly is a cold blooded and nasty s.o.b. Director Renny Harlin proves once again to be a master of the large scale action film, keeping the pace going through one riveting sequence after another. "Cliffhanger" is the kind of movie where even at a hefty enough running time (1 Hour 53 minutes in this case) the time just flies by. Of course, this is due in no small part to the incredible setting. The Dolomite mountains of Italy stand in for the American Rockies, where the story is set. All of this natural grandeur really takes ones' breath away, and the sense of being at dizzying heights is extremely palpable. This is white knuckle stuff all the way. Taking away a little from some of the enjoyment are some stupid and annoying characters doing stupid and annoying things, but then, this movie is hardly unique in the world of film when it comes to that element. The bad guys, also including Rex Linn ('C.S.I.: Miami'), Caroline Goodall, Leon, Gregory Scott Cummins, Craig Fairbrass, and Denis Forest, are largely the kind of scum where you have a high old time just aching for their demise. And on the other side, the good guys are all likable enough, with Stallone showing again how he can be under appreciated as an actor; old pro Ralph Waite is delightful as Frank, and Michael Rooker is aces as Gabes' friend and fellow climber who's spent some time resenting him for that failed rescue attempt at the beginning of the movie. Other familiar faces lend a welcome presence: Max Perlich, Zach Grenier, Vyto Ruginis, Don S. Davis, John Finn, Bruce McGill, and the always solid Paul Winfield. Soaring music by Trevor Jones and excellent cinematography by Alex Thomson add to the enjoyment. This is genuinely exciting and suspenseful stuff that reels you in right from the start and keeps you watching the whole time. It's one of Sly's best ever vehicles. Eight out of 10.

Then he carries the guilt which really wasn't his fault. They should have just went on with the flamboyant attitude, and it would have been even better. I liked the scene where Stallone climbs up the snow covered rock face in a T shirt (this of course is totally preposterous in real life). Very cool. Seriously, this movie had some of the best Silvester Stallone moments, and I wished they'd make more movies like this of his.

    Anything that Stallone did in the 80's and 90's was "so bad it's good", but this one is simply spectacular on epic scale! Stallone doesn't have a clue about acting (and he couldn't have), but he's trying so hard, God bless him... The icing on the cake here is John Lithgow, none other than the master of the "over-the-top acting", whose fake British accent only adds up to the camp. Magnificent alpine landscapes make a perfect setting, and the pace is alert indeed, with some of the most spectacular stunts and action sequences ever filmed. Bad characters are really evil (and extremely funny, I might add), the good guys are really good and brave and have super-human strength (Stallone is climbing mountain walls bare-handed in the blizzard, wearing just a T-shirt), the one-liners are on the same epic scale as the breath-taking scenery, and of course "Cliffhanger" has dialogue so dumb it's unintentionally hilarious. The plot is laughable, just as much as everything else in this movie, but never mind This is what we call "mindless entertainment" of the best kind. I thoroughly enjoyed this masterpiece, it's great comedy. I dare you not to laugh out loud at the preposterousness of it all.

    Sylvester Stallone is in Haunted Hero mode in this slam bang bit of escapism, playing Gabe Walker, a mountain rescue expert who in the movie's opening set piece is unable to stop a climber from meeting their doom. Racked with guilt, he spends some time away before returning to his old haunt to ask girlfriend Jessie (Janine Turner) to come away with him. This coincides with the actions of some ruthless airborne criminals who have purloined international currency from the Treasury Department. These people are led by John Lithgow as Eric Qualen, and Lithgow here shows he definitely has what it takes as an action movie villain. He truly is a cold blooded and nasty s.o.b. Director Renny Harlin proves once again to be a master of the large scale action film, keeping the pace going through one riveting sequence after another. "Cliffhanger" is the kind of movie where even at a hefty enough running time (1 Hour 53 minutes in this case) the time just flies by. Of course, this is due in no small part to the incredible setting. The Dolomite mountains of Italy stand in for the American Rockies, where the story is set. All of this natural grandeur really takes ones' breath away, and the sense of being at dizzying heights is extremely palpable. This is white knuckle stuff all the way. Taking away a little from some of the enjoyment are some stupid and annoying characters doing stupid and annoying things, but then, this movie is hardly unique in the world of film when it comes to that element. The bad guys, also including Rex Linn ('C.S.I.: Miami'), Caroline Goodall, Leon, Gregory Scott Cummins, Craig Fairbrass, and Denis Forest, are largely the kind of scum where you have a high old time just aching for their demise. And on the other side, the good guys are all likable enough, with Stallone showing again how he can be under appreciated as an actor; old pro Ralph Waite is delightful as Frank, and Michael Rooker is aces as Gabes' friend and fellow climber who's spent some time resenting him for that failed rescue attempt at the beginning of the movie. Other familiar faces lend a welcome presence: Max Perlich, Zach Grenier, Vyto Ruginis, Don S. Davis, John Finn, Bruce McGill, and the always solid Paul Winfield. Soaring music by Trevor Jones and excellent cinematography by Alex Thomson add to the enjoyment. This is genuinely exciting and suspenseful stuff that reels you in right from the start and keeps you watching the whole time. It's one of Sly's best ever vehicles. Eight out of 10.

    "Cliffhanger" is quite underrated action movie . It's a mix between "The Eiger Sanction" and "Die hard" . I think that from all "Die hard" clones this is the best one. It's refreshing to see an action movie set in mountains . It allowed the filmmakers for some nice ideas and a breathtaking views. This is Stallone's finest performance along with the "Rocky" and "Rambo" series. He fits his character  Gabe , a mountain rescuer with troubled past  perfectly . He's character isn't a ex-marine , ex-soldier or cop , but a normal human . That's what makes it interesting to watch how will he be able to defeat the bad guys. He's got solid support from Michael Rooker (Hal) and Janine Turner (Jesse). John Lithgow is great as the cold blooded leader of bandits  Quialan. This movie and "Ricochet" proves that comedy actors can give a great serious performance , only if somebody needs to give them a chance. The best scene of the movie happens at the beginning . It always makes hair on my back stand up. It's a really thrilling scene that takes audience by surprise , because we were expecting a different end to it. I also have to mention the final showdown between Stallone , Lithgow and the helicopter. "Cliffhanger" is directed with professionalism by Renny Harlin ("Die hard 2") . The screenplay offers some nice laughs and twists. The whole movie is photographed well and looks good , even if sometimes it's obvious that some scenes were filmed in studio. Also you have to suspend your belief few times ( the unrealistic destruction of airplane , Stallone not freezing to death despite wearing almost nothing) , but after all this is an action movie. "Cliffhanger" should be rated higher. I give it 8/10.

    True to its Title, a lot of folks do hang from a lot of cliffs, and they also hang from other things as well. Ropes, bridges, helicopters, trees, ladders, and credibility also hangs in the balance. This type of thing can be charm- fully exciting, Wow-Cool stuff. This one delivers quite a bit of that. But somehow nothing seems to work very well. The broad expanse of the landscape is beautifully shot but adds little to the menace. It is more breathtaking than, well, breathtaking in a suspenseful kinda way. The Villain, is usually a diabolical genius in the Genre, but here he is so stilted and unannotated (maybe he was freezing) that John Lithgow's usually creepy self is reduced to playing Second-Psycho to His Gang of the more Psychopathic. The Star and the Director have done much better Work elsewhere and go through the mountains motionless and everyone on the "set" seems surprisingly uninspired. In the end it is mildly entertaining and worth a view, but there are so many Action Movies that are better, that this one can only be considered lost in the Wilderness of its contemporaries.

    I had planned, as part of my plan for my 500th review, to watch one of the all-time iconic pictures - "Casablanca" - but in the event, I wasn't in the mood. I needed something brainless to cheer me up and figured that a Stallone pic would do the trick. I know, I shouldn't have expected to be as entertained or enriched as I might have been with Bogie and the others but sometimes, you just need to disengage the brain and settle down to watch fancy stunts, excessively macho fight sequences, cheesy one-liners and ridiculously silly plots. And this film delivered exactly what I ordered and for once, it was a relief to watch a Stallone film without that nagging sense of cheapness that normally accompanies such outings. Sly plays Gabe, a rugged member of a small mountain rescue team who's struggling with guilt after failing to save his best friend Hal's (Michael Rooker) girlfriend. A year later and Gabe returns to the area in order to win over his old flame and fellow colleague Jessie (Janine Turner) but is interrupted by a distress call. Deciding to conquer his demons, Gabe joins up with Hal in order to locate and rescue some hikers trapped by a fast-approaching storm. But the distress call is actually an attempt by professional criminals, led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow), to recover three missing suitcases filled with stolen money and escape the mountain using Hal and Gabe as their guides... Although it is a much better film than this, "Cliffhanger" is rather reminiscent of another Nineties action blockbuster with a daft plot, "Speed" in that it balances ludicrous plotting with some half-decent action. The film is amazingly shot with some stunning scenery and pretty physical action amid the peaks and precarious drops. The plot, however, is as clearly nonsensical as some of the action scenes (I love the fact that Gabe will climb sheer cliffs in his shoes, despite the fact he has crampons in his shoulder-mounted tool-kit!) and Lithgow, as the lead baddie, is frankly hilarious as he hams it up with his dodgy English accent. Stallone, to his credit, gives the role a fair game and most of the stunt work looks pretty good too. So it ticks all the technical boxes for an all-out action pic - it's stupid, predictable and laden with impossible plot contrivances and action sequences. All I wanted was a bit more thought behind it. And yet... despite the flaws, there is something else that is harder to measure. It isn't your regular action movie - gun play is kept to a minimum and the mountain setting offers something different to the thousands of identikit action pics out there. "Cliffhanger" doesn't pretend to be anything other than your boys-night-in rental offering, a heady cocktail of stunt-work and machismo without anything much to really think about like plot points. In short, it delivers precisely what you expect it to but without that usual sense of being short-changed watching a Stallone pic. Normally, I find myself wishing I could watch a Schwarzenegger film instead of whatever Sly flick is showing but not so this time. And while it may not become as iconic as "Casablanca", it's still a great action movie that fans of the genre would appreciate.

    Holds up pretty damn well after 20 years. "Cliffhanger" typifies the big dumb action movies of the '90s, and for this, it makes no apologies. The good news here is that it's quite effective at what it sets out to do. It's "'Die Hard' on a Mountain", pitting Stallone's rock jock against a group of international thieves as they journey to recover their money in the Rocky mountains. And the henchmen are all a bunch of assholes, of the "I-can't-wait-til-Stallone-kills-you" variety (complete with a terrible performance from Rex Linn), while the movie is easily stolen by stone-cold John Lithgow. Lithgow's villain is one of the genre's greatest, possessing the quiet menace and pithy asides that just endear him to the audience. But he's not just posturing for the camera, he's taking a stock role (albeit one with delightful one-liners) and truly making it his own. He's got the smarts, the master plan and the ruthless edge that makes him a match for the muscle-bound hero. The stuntwork in this movie is insane and, when combined with the gorgeous scenery, makes for some incredible visuals. Not to mention the huge action set pieces including the high-flying leaps, explosions, plane hijackings and Michael Rooker's constantly on the receiving end of brutal ass-kickings. I was mildly shocked by just how violent "Cliffhanger" was for '93; they spared no expense on bloody carnage. It is indeed thrilling, helped no doubt by the suspenseful ending. And that opening is still a punch to the gut. Not up there with "Die Hard", but nonetheless a great action film (making for a one-two Stallone punch along with "Demolition Man"). 8/10

    Cliffhanger is an action-adventure thriller that features Sylvester Stallone and John Lithgow together with Michael Rooker,Janine Turner,Leon Robinson,Paul Winfield and Ralph Waite.Stallone plays Gabe Walker, a member of a mountain-climbing rescue team who is haunted by an incident from his past when he couldn't save the girlfriend of his best friend, Hal Tucker,from falling to her death.It was directed by Renny Harlin. Gabe has left mountain-climbing rescue work and has set up business in Denver. He returns to the mountain rescue office to persuade his lover, Jessie to quit and come back to Denver with him. While he is begging Jessie to head out to Denver, things are happening in the skies overhead. A gang of professional crooks headed by psychotic Eric Qualen has hijacked a U.S. Treasury plane carrying millions of dollars. But the plane crashes, and the bad guys find themselves stranded on top of a mountain with the money that was placed into three cases scattered around the wreckage and with no way to get down off the pinnacle to retrieve the cases. They put in a phony distress call that is received by the mountain rescue team. Gabe agrees to take part in one last rescue attempt, and they head up to help rescue the thieves. But Qualen has plans for the rescuers to force them to climb through the dangerous snow-covered peaks to find the three suitcases of cash. Cliffhanger is a device to entertain us, and it works, especially during those moments when Stallone is hanging by his fingernails over a three- mile fall, and the bad guys are stomping on him.Also,it is a big-scale action adventure with plenty of blood and blasts. It resembles some Shakespeare plays only in that by the end of the story almost all the characters are laying in pools of blood.Finally,it may go down in screen history as the nail in the coffin of the Die Hard sub-genre, in which all the key elements of that blockbuster have been recycled to the point of self-parody.

    Rock climbing was the fad of the time, and this and another movie "K2" appeared around the same time. They really did a seamless job of going from studio shots to on the location shots. The cliffhanger scenes were really realistic. This movie has one of the best opening scenes of any movie made. The mistake perhaps was that they didn't keep going with this flow. As soon as the scene changed to the plane crash scene, it lost some of the momentum, then it was down hill from there. The movie basically makes super human hero out of Sylvester Stallone, but he really fits the bill. He had the right flamboyant attitude as the hero too. Then he carries the guilt which really wasn't his fault. They should have just went on with the flamboyant attitude, and it would have been even better. I liked the scene where Stallone climbs up the snow covered rock face in a T shirt (this of course is totally preposterous in real life). Very cool. Seriously, this movie had some of the best Silvester Stallone moments, and I wished they'd make more movies like this of his.

It's "'Die Hard' on a Mountain", pitting Stallone's rock jock against a group of international thieves as they journey to recover their money in the Rocky mountains. And the henchmen are all a bunch of assholes, of the "I-can't-wait-til-Stallone-kills-you" variety (complete with a terrible performance from Rex Linn), while the movie is easily stolen by stone-cold John Lithgow. Lithgow's villain is one of the genre's greatest, possessing the quiet menace and pithy asides that just endear him to the audience. But he's not just posturing for the camera, he's taking a stock role (albeit one with delightful one-liners) and truly making it his own. He's got the smarts, the master plan and the ruthless edge that makes him a match for the muscle-bound hero. The stuntwork in this movie is insane and, when combined with the gorgeous scenery, makes for some incredible visuals. Not to mention the huge action set pieces including the high-flying leaps, explosions, plane hijackings and Michael Rooker's constantly on the receiving end of brutal ass-kickings. I was mildly shocked by just how violent "Cliffhanger" was for '93; they spared no expense on bloody carnage. It is indeed thrilling, helped no doubt by the suspenseful ending. And that opening is still a punch to the gut. Not up there with "Die Hard", but nonetheless a great action film (making for a one-two Stallone punch along with "Demolition Man"). 8/10

    Cliffhanger is an action-adventure thriller that features Sylvester Stallone and John Lithgow together with Michael Rooker,Janine Turner,Leon Robinson,Paul Winfield and Ralph Waite.Stallone plays Gabe Walker, a member of a mountain-climbing rescue team who is haunted by an incident from his past when he couldn't save the girlfriend of his best friend, Hal Tucker,from falling to her death.It was directed by Renny Harlin. Gabe has left mountain-climbing rescue work and has set up business in Denver. He returns to the mountain rescue office to persuade his lover, Jessie to quit and come back to Denver with him. While he is begging Jessie to head out to Denver, things are happening in the skies overhead. A gang of professional crooks headed by psychotic Eric Qualen has hijacked a U.S. Treasury plane carrying millions of dollars. But the plane crashes, and the bad guys find themselves stranded on top of a mountain with the money that was placed into three cases scattered around the wreckage and with no way to get down off the pinnacle to retrieve the cases. They put in a phony distress call that is received by the mountain rescue team. Gabe agrees to take part in one last rescue attempt, and they head up to help rescue the thieves. But Qualen has plans for the rescuers to force them to climb through the dangerous snow-covered peaks to find the three suitcases of cash. Cliffhanger is a device to entertain us, and it works, especially during those moments when Stallone is hanging by his fingernails over a three- mile fall, and the bad guys are stomping on him.Also,it is a big-scale action adventure with plenty of blood and blasts. It resembles some Shakespeare plays only in that by the end of the story almost all the characters are laying in pools of blood.Finally,it may go down in screen history as the nail in the coffin of the Die Hard sub-genre, in which all the key elements of that blockbuster have been recycled to the point of self-parody.

    Rock climbing was the fad of the time, and this and another movie "K2" appeared around the same time. They really did a seamless job of going from studio shots to on the location shots. The cliffhanger scenes were really realistic. This movie has one of the best opening scenes of any movie made. The mistake perhaps was that they didn't keep going with this flow. As soon as the scene changed to the plane crash scene, it lost some of the momentum, then it was down hill from there. The movie basically makes super human hero out of Sylvester Stallone, but he really fits the bill. He had the right flamboyant attitude as the hero too. Then he carries the guilt which really wasn't his fault. They should have just went on with the flamboyant attitude, and it would have been even better. I liked the scene where Stallone climbs up the snow covered rock face in a T shirt (this of course is totally preposterous in real life). Very cool. Seriously, this movie had some of the best Silvester Stallone moments, and I wished they'd make more movies like this of his.

    Anything that Stallone did in the 80's and 90's was "so bad it's good", but this one is simply spectacular on epic scale! Stallone doesn't have a clue about acting (and he couldn't have), but he's trying so hard, God bless him... The icing on the cake here is John Lithgow, none other than the master of the "over-the-top acting", whose fake British accent only adds up to the camp. Magnificent alpine landscapes make a perfect setting, and the pace is alert indeed, with some of the most spectacular stunts and action sequences ever filmed. Bad characters are really evil (and extremely funny, I might add), the good guys are really good and brave and have super-human strength (Stallone is climbing mountain walls bare-handed in the blizzard, wearing just a T-shirt), the one-liners are on the same epic scale as the breath-taking scenery, and of course "Cliffhanger" has dialogue so dumb it's unintentionally hilarious. The plot is laughable, just as much as everything else in this movie, but never mind This is what we call "mindless entertainment" of the best kind. I thoroughly enjoyed this masterpiece, it's great comedy. I dare you not to laugh out loud at the preposterousness of it all.

    Sylvester Stallone is in Haunted Hero mode in this slam bang bit of escapism, playing Gabe Walker, a mountain rescue expert who in the movie's opening set piece is unable to stop a climber from meeting their doom. Racked with guilt, he spends some time away before returning to his old haunt to ask girlfriend Jessie (Janine Turner) to come away with him. This coincides with the actions of some ruthless airborne criminals who have purloined international currency from the Treasury Department. These people are led by John Lithgow as Eric Qualen, and Lithgow here shows he definitely has what it takes as an action movie villain. He truly is a cold blooded and nasty s.o.b. Director Renny Harlin proves once again to be a master of the large scale action film, keeping the pace going through one riveting sequence after another. "Cliffhanger" is the kind of movie where even at a hefty enough running time (1 Hour 53 minutes in this case) the time just flies by. Of course, this is due in no small part to the incredible setting. The Dolomite mountains of Italy stand in for the American Rockies, where the story is set. All of this natural grandeur really takes ones' breath away, and the sense of being at dizzying heights is extremely palpable. This is white knuckle stuff all the way. Taking away a little from some of the enjoyment are some stupid and annoying characters doing stupid and annoying things, but then, this movie is hardly unique in the world of film when it comes to that element. The bad guys, also including Rex Linn ('C.S.I.: Miami'), Caroline Goodall, Leon, Gregory Scott Cummins, Craig Fairbrass, and Denis Forest, are largely the kind of scum where you have a high old time just aching for their demise. And on the other side, the good guys are all likable enough, with Stallone showing again how he can be under appreciated as an actor; old pro Ralph Waite is delightful as Frank, and Michael Rooker is aces as Gabes' friend and fellow climber who's spent some time resenting him for that failed rescue attempt at the beginning of the movie. Other familiar faces lend a welcome presence: Max Perlich, Zach Grenier, Vyto Ruginis, Don S. Davis, John Finn, Bruce McGill, and the always solid Paul Winfield. Soaring music by Trevor Jones and excellent cinematography by Alex Thomson add to the enjoyment. This is genuinely exciting and suspenseful stuff that reels you in right from the start and keeps you watching the whole time. It's one of Sly's best ever vehicles. Eight out of 10.

    "Cliffhanger" is quite underrated action movie . It's a mix between "The Eiger Sanction" and "Die hard" . I think that from all "Die hard" clones this is the best one. It's refreshing to see an action movie set in mountains . It allowed the filmmakers for some nice ideas and a breathtaking views. This is Stallone's finest performance along with the "Rocky" and "Rambo" series. He fits his character  Gabe , a mountain rescuer with troubled past  perfectly . He's character isn't a ex-marine , ex-soldier or cop , but a normal human . That's what makes it interesting to watch how will he be able to defeat the bad guys. He's got solid support from Michael Rooker (Hal) and Janine Turner (Jesse). John Lithgow is great as the cold blooded leader of bandits  Quialan. This movie and "Ricochet" proves that comedy actors can give a great serious performance , only if somebody needs to give them a chance. The best scene of the movie happens at the beginning . It always makes hair on my back stand up. It's a really thrilling scene that takes audience by surprise , because we were expecting a different end to it. I also have to mention the final showdown between Stallone , Lithgow and the helicopter. "Cliffhanger" is directed with professionalism by Renny Harlin ("Die hard 2") . The screenplay offers some nice laughs and twists. The whole movie is photographed well and looks good , even if sometimes it's obvious that some scenes were filmed in studio. Also you have to suspend your belief few times ( the unrealistic destruction of airplane , Stallone not freezing to death despite wearing almost nothing) , but after all this is an action movie. "Cliffhanger" should be rated higher. I give it 8/10.

    A veteran mountain climber / search and rescue man loses a woman in a rescue attempt in the mountains, and I guilt ridden when she falls to her death. flash forward a few years. he disappears into isolation, but when a group of bad guys loses 3 briefcases full of hundreds of millions of dollars he comes out of seclusion to help out his friends. he reluctantly teams up with the man who was gonna marry the girl he lost years ago, John Lithgow heads up the bads guys, with Michael Rooker, the bad guys have lost briefcases which need recovering before the FBI gets' involved,, add in a crooked DEA agent and you have a movie with a tons of action,, great footgage of avalanches, lot's of gunplay , twists, and drama,, one of the better action films to come out of the 90's if you ask me,, definitely a perfect movie for Sylvester Stallone to shine in. but Litgow steals the show for me.

    True to its Title, a lot of folks do hang from a lot of cliffs, and they also hang from other things as well. Ropes, bridges, helicopters, trees, ladders, and credibility also hangs in the balance. This type of thing can be charm- fully exciting, Wow-Cool stuff. This one delivers quite a bit of that. But somehow nothing seems to work very well. The broad expanse of the landscape is beautifully shot but adds little to the menace. It is more breathtaking than, well, breathtaking in a suspenseful kinda way. The Villain, is usually a diabolical genius in the Genre, but here he is so stilted and unannotated (maybe he was freezing) that John Lithgow's usually creepy self is reduced to playing Second-Psycho to His Gang of the more Psychopathic. The Star and the Director have done much better Work elsewhere and go through the mountains motionless and everyone on the "set" seems surprisingly uninspired. In the end it is mildly entertaining and worth a view, but there are so many Action Movies that are better, that this one can only be considered lost in the Wilderness of its contemporaries.

    I had planned, as part of my plan for my 500th review, to watch one of the all-time iconic pictures - "Casablanca" - but in the event, I wasn't in the mood. I needed something brainless to cheer me up and figured that a Stallone pic would do the trick. I know, I shouldn't have expected to be as entertained or enriched as I might have been with Bogie and the others but sometimes, you just need to disengage the brain and settle down to watch fancy stunts, excessively macho fight sequences, cheesy one-liners and ridiculously silly plots. And this film delivered exactly what I ordered and for once, it was a relief to watch a Stallone film without that nagging sense of cheapness that normally accompanies such outings. Sly plays Gabe, a rugged member of a small mountain rescue team who's struggling with guilt after failing to save his best friend Hal's (Michael Rooker) girlfriend. A year later and Gabe returns to the area in order to win over his old flame and fellow colleague Jessie (Janine Turner) but is interrupted by a distress call. Deciding to conquer his demons, Gabe joins up with Hal in order to locate and rescue some hikers trapped by a fast-approaching storm. But the distress call is actually an attempt by professional criminals, led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow), to recover three missing suitcases filled with stolen money and escape the mountain using Hal and Gabe as their guides... Although it is a much better film than this, "Cliffhanger" is rather reminiscent of another Nineties action blockbuster with a daft plot, "Speed" in that it balances ludicrous plotting with some half-decent action. The film is amazingly shot with some stunning scenery and pretty physical action amid the peaks and precarious drops. The plot, however, is as clearly nonsensical as some of the action scenes (I love the fact that Gabe will climb sheer cliffs in his shoes, despite the fact he has crampons in his shoulder-mounted tool-kit!) and Lithgow, as the lead baddie, is frankly hilarious as he hams it up with his dodgy English accent. Stallone, to his credit, gives the role a fair game and most of the stunt work looks pretty good too. So it ticks all the technical boxes for an all-out action pic - it's stupid, predictable and laden with impossible plot contrivances and action sequences. All I wanted was a bit more thought behind it. And yet... despite the flaws, there is something else that is harder to measure. It isn't your regular action movie - gun play is kept to a minimum and the mountain setting offers something different to the thousands of identikit action pics out there. "Cliffhanger" doesn't pretend to be anything other than your boys-night-in rental offering, a heady cocktail of stunt-work and machismo without anything much to really think about like plot points. In short, it delivers precisely what you expect it to but without that usual sense of being short-changed watching a Stallone pic. Normally, I find myself wishing I could watch a Schwarzenegger film instead of whatever Sly flick is showing but not so this time. And while it may not become as iconic as "Casablanca", it's still a great action movie that fans of the genre would appreciate.
