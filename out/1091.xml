    I have never forgotten this movie and some song lyrics where always on my mind for over 20 years. I didn't watch it again for a long time, assuming it is a kid movie, until lately, where I discovered that there is also the long 129 minutes version. Surprisingly, I found myself very entertained even as a an adult! Of course one has a different perspective and there where so many jokes and side remarks that I just didn't get as a kid - it was wonderful to "rediscover" this movie. The ocean scenery is beautiful and the songs - they are just great, sometimes funny, sometimes really touching. This movie is so heart warming, well done for its time and brings along many important messages about friendship, love, tolerance, enjoying life together, but also doing the right thing and stand up for what you believe - just like Nora, my favorite character. I found myself in a very good mood the rest of the day, remembering my childhood and humming "Brazzle Dazzle day" ;-) So what is the definition of a good movie ? A movie you can watch as kid or adult discovering different things, a movie with music & lyrics you never forget and have to sing along, a movie that makes you think and appreciate your loved ones, family and friends but also lifts you up and makes you feel happy ? If that's not the definition of a good movie, then I don't know what is. I will watch it again and again.

    I saw this movie a number of times on HBO, but, Ironically enough, I can't remember too much about it. I remember when it was first advertised for the theatres, and shrugging my shoulders at it as a kids' film. A friend of mine really took to it, but I don't recall anything too extraordinary about it. The old "out of the ink well" animation formula is taken to the extreme when a young boy who comes across a sleepy coastside Hamlet discovers intrigue among the locals. His special medieval mythical fire-breathing (and flying) friend aids him in his search for a family and to right a wrong. To be honest, I never got the whole thing, but it was fun for what it was. Not a film I would own in my collection ... unless the wife and kids wanted it. Don't get me wrong, it's a very fine children's film, my tastes just lie elsewhere. Give it a whirl on the old DVD player, and watch it with the family. Enjoy.

    Like many people, I am in the process of upgrading my collection from VHS to DVD/Blu-Ray. This was on-sale at Amazon. What a surprise! Much better than I remember it. Great songs and cast with great performances by Red Buttons and Mickey Rooney. Shelly Winters plays a wonderfully-horrible villain with "blackout" teeth. A simple story about a dragon that only Pete can see (at first) and clever dragon mechanical effects: Pete riding Elliott, toasting apples, dragon footprints, his "outline" on the schoolhouse wall, thrashing around inside a whale-sized net. The dragon animation by Don Bluth is fanciful, which is good because this is a children's' movie. Some technical glitches, as the "yellowscreen" (sodium vapor) process renders Elliott the Dragon somewhat transparent and prone to color-shifts. But this is not something that kids care about anyway. Although "Candle on the Water" is the Oscar-wining song, I bet you start humming "Brazzle-Dazzle Day" as the movie ends!

    This is one of the best musicals of all time, right up there with The Sound of Music. Yes, I have a lot of nostalgia as I had this on Betamax growing up and wore it out... but now I'm watching it with my own kids and they love it just like I did. This movie holds up and translates well to all generations. The songs are fantastic, but my least favorite is the one it may be most known for (Candle on the water). Lampie... Doc Terminus... they're all just really, really good performances of well written songs. It has everything a musical needs. Great acting, great singing, great choreography, great story, and a lot of heart. The live action/animation is really good for the time, so there's no reason to get hung up on that. Plus Elliot is awesome. I honestly can't understand how this is under 9 stars.

    Pete is a small boy running away from slavery with an abusive hillbilly family who have "bought" him. He falls in with an invisible dragon and a lighthouse keeper and his daughter, and assorted good and bad things happen. This Disney offering is one of the more forgotten live action movies despite the fact that it has quite a lot going for it. It is colourful, daft, has a good moral heart, some excellent villains, decent songs, and decent effects (both physical effects and traditional animation). The performances are all good, with Helen Reddy doing well in her only movie lead role, and young Sean Marshall's sincerity outweighing his winsome cuteness. This is still a good family film.

    I had seen the iconic image of the little ginger kid and the title character, I do remember at one time seeing a couple of clips as well, it was just a case of watching the actual early Disney animation and live action film, from director Don Chaffey (Jason and the Argonauts, One Million Years B.C.). Basically, set in early 20th Century New England, nine year old orphan boy Pete (Sean Marshall) has escaped his abusive adoptive parents, the Gorgans, led by the nasty mother Lena (Shelley Winters). His only true friend is the one who found him, a large green and purple haired and winged fire breathing cartoon dragon named Elliott (the grunts and roars voiced by Charlie Callas), and whenever he can't be seen he can turn himself invisible. Pete and Elliot have travelled to Passamaquoddy, Maine, an ocean front harbour town, filled with superstitious fishermen, drunken hooligans and wary townsfolk, and they try to find somewhere to settle, the invisible dragon obviously causing some destruction. Eventually Pete meets Nora (Helen Reddy), the daughter of drunken lighthouse operator Lampie (Mickey Rooney), he in fact is the only one to see Elliot, but the little boy is allowed to live in the lighthouse, while the dragon hides in the beach cave nearby. The little boy's arrival causes a lot of rumours, rioting and gossip in the town, and this ignites the interest of visiting con artist Dr. Terminus (Carry On's Jim Dale), who believing the dragon superstition is keen to get his hands on it for profit. There comes the point when Elliot is indeed borough out in the open and exposed, even captured, while Pete's horrible adoptive parents the Gogans come back to snatch him. In the end of course the bad guys get what they deserve and are driven away. Peter settles happily in his new home with Nora and Lampy, who did find out about the dragon, and Elliot has to fly away to find another child to help. Also starring Red Buttons as Hoagy, Jim Backus as The Mayor and Jeff Conaway as Willie. The performances as you would expect are very cheesy, as is the story, and seeing that mixing cartoon with live action was at the early stage it does look a bit dated, but a couple of the songs, including "Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)", "I Saw a Dragon" and "Brazzle Dazzle Day" are alright, and Elliot is a lovable cartoon character, but I can't really see myself watching this part-animated musical fantasy again. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for "Candle on the Water" and Best Music for Al Kasha, Joel Hirschhorn and Irwin Kostal, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Adequate!

    By the middle/end of the 1970s, the Disney studio was in crisis. Walt had died relatively recently, and the conservative management who ran the company kept on consciously producing films they thought Walt would have made back in the 50s and 60s. As a result, nearly all of the films being produced, at least the live-action ones, were not just throwbacks; they were generally all quite stale with it. "Pete's Dragon" is one such film. It tries to be the next "Mary Poppins" but genuinely fails. Not only does it not live up to that film's legacy, but it hasn't really got any pizazz of its own. The story concerns a young orphan named Pete who runs away from a cruel family of hillbillies with the help of his pet dragon Eliot. Along the way, Eliot, who can turn himself invisible, gets up to mischief, and hilarity ensues. The pair arrive in a small New England town, where Pete ends up staying with a kindly lighthouse keeper named Nora and her lovable drunken father. In keeping with the spirit of replicating "Mary Poppins", the titular dragon character is animated, and the best moments in the film tend to feature him. He is a cute and well animated creation, even if he doesn't quite fit seamlessly into the live-action world around him. However, the story overall is boring and introduces too many elements at the wrong time, and many scenes fail to move the plot along at all (including a scene where the lighthouse keeper and the evil doctor's assistant go to look for Eliot in the cave). Acting and character development are also consistently below average. The musical numbers tend to be overdone, and some of them are just downright awful. Though I saw the standard version many years ago, the version I last watched was the shortened version on the UK's Channel 5, which did a lot of good by shortening or even removing the most long-winded scenes (primarily the musical numbers), but even that didn't do much to diffuse some of the film's problems. Let me state that I did not want to go out of my way to hate this film. I am a big fan of Disney, and I watched "Pete's Dragon" as a child a few times and I quite liked it (even if not to the same extent as "Mary Poppins" or "Bedknobs and Broomsticks"). However, as an intelligent adult, I can see hardly any worth in this film. It seems overall like a mismanaged and highly amateur attempt to make a "Disney classic" based on the elements of more successful previous films.

    Pete (Sean Marshall) is a poor orphan boy who arrives in the small town of Passamaquoddy to escape his cruel, slave-driving adopted parents. The residents are generally nice folk, only they don't take too well to Pete due to his large, mainly invisible dragon named Elliott. The first person to see it is local lovable drunk Lampie (Mickey Rooney), who makes his concerns known only to be laughed at. So Pete is taken in by Lampie's daughter Nora (Helen Reddy), a lighthouse worker who is still pining for her partner who disappeared at sea almost a year prior. Trouble starts to brew though when a medicine wheeler-dealer named Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale) arrives in town and sees profit in the dragon. One of Disney's few attempts to cash in on the success of Mary Poppins (1964), combining live-action with animation, Pete's Dragon is one of their lesser known efforts (although it does have it's nostalgia-filled fanbase). It was made in a time where freckly ginger kids were considered cute and likable child characters, and the adults overacted to the point where they looked like they were presenting a children's TV show. Containing very few memorable songs (if any) and some very shoddy animation, Pete's Dragon is one of Disney's laziest and poorest productions. None of Disney's classic animators (the 'Nine Old Men') worked on the film and it shows. Of what little dragon there is, it appears very little effort or imagination was put into it. Thank the lord then, for Dr. Terminus, played with enjoyable enthusiasm by Jim Dale (who appeared in a few Carry On films) who saves the film from complete embarrassment. He gets the best song 'Passamaquoddy', in which he tries to charm the townsfolk into buying his crap medicine that has already made one of them fat and turned another one of their hair pink, while repeatedly mispronouncing the name of the town. He's like a malpractising Del Boy, and is so enjoyable that I was rooting for him to get his hands on the annoying ginger kid and his crappily animated dragon. Not a total failure then, but instantly forgettable, overlong, excruciatingly squeaky-clean, and exhaustingly enthusiastic. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    I remember at one point in my childhood, I heard about a movie called "Pete's Dragon", maybe when it was about to come on TV, and also remember seeing some of it, though I can't remember how much I saw. There was another part of the film I remember seeing some years later (the part where the Dr. Terminus character manages to win over the initially angry people), but I didn't know what movie I was seeing. After many years, I could still remember the title of this mostly live action Disney film (but one with a cartoon dragon), and finally decided to watch it from start to finish this week. It's far from one of the most highly regarded Disney productions in the long history of the company, and I wasn't expecting it to be among the great ones, but I was expecting it to be better than I found it to be, which is not good at all for the most part. With the help of his magical dragon, Elliott, a young orphaned boy named Pete manages to escape from his cruel adoptive family, the Gogans, but they are still determined to find him somehow or other. The boy and his dragon friend travel together and soon come to a village called Passamaquoddy. Before they enter, Pete tells Elliott that he must make himself invisible (a magical power of his) in order to avoid scaring the people, so the dragon reluctantly does so, but even in his invisible form, he soon causes a lot of trouble in the village, and since nobody can see him, it looks like Pete is responsible! After Pete gets away from an angry mob and Elliott scares Lampie, the drunken lighthouse keeper, the two of them go to a cave near the lighthouse, where Nora, Lampie's daughter, finds Pete and decides to give him shelter in her home. He often talks to her about Elliott, and she doesn't believe that this dragon actually exists, but plays along. Unfortunately, the dragon continues to cause trouble for Pete, and the village of Passamaquoddy has another problem when medicine showman Dr. Terminus and his assistant, Hoagy, are back to swindle the villagers again with their fraudulent formulas! This live action/animation crossover is a musical, and unfortunately, the songs generally don't have much effect. I think this already shows with the first song, sung by the Gogans as they pursue Pete, but it gets worse after the boy and his dragon friend get away from them and we hear the next musical number, "Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)". During this song, I felt like I was watching something strictly for the very young. Basically, the rest of the songs also fail, including the "I Saw a Dragon" one featured in the part where Lampie tells the people in the tavern what he saw, a notably clumsy segment of the film. The musical numbers are only one of the significant flaws in the film. Most of the cast performances failed to impress me, especially Jane Kean overacting in the role of Miss Taylor, the strict teacher of the village. It doesn't seem that Sean Marshall, who plays the title character, was a very good child actor. "Pete's Dragon" does have some pretty funny parts, but not enough to make it really work as a comedy, either. Also, while I certainly didn't find myself not caring what happened to any of the characters, I still didn't find most of the story too entertaining for some reason, but that might have been largely because of the other problems. This is a mainly live action family musical, and maybe I'm not usually into movies like this, but that hasn't stopped me from finding "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory", a live action family musical from six years before this one, to be a great film, so it's definitely not like "Pete's Dragon" would look bad to me regardless of quality. This particular Disney piece came out the same year as "The Rescuers", an all animated feature which disappointed me when I first saw it last year (I actually found its 1990 sequel, "The Rescuers Down Under", to be much better, as rare as that is with sequels and as much as many Disney fans would probably disagree), but even that film I found to be better than this very lacklustre live action/animation crossover. I gave "Pete's Dragon" a try, and realize that it has a following (not a huge one, but it is a following), but simply put, I just didn't like it. I guess I can still recommend it for kids and won't say adults should avoid it at all costs, but I also still think there are good reasons for all the criticism.

    Endearing animated monster movie about a lively dragon and his little friend . The story takes place in Maine circa 1908 , the starring are an orphaned 9-years-old boy named Pete (Sean Marshall) and his sympathetic dragon Elliot . Freckly Pete flee the overbearing foster Gogan family (Shelley Winters , Charles Tyner), who all utilize him as a slave instead of a kind child. When Pete can successfully escape from them with his protective dragon , his only friend , that only can see , then they stumble into the town of Passamaquaddy- an ocean front dock town plenty of fishermen, drunks and rare people . Pete's arrival does not fit well with the townsfolk , as his pale green dragon Elliott accidentally causes town destruction and rioting among the school teacher , the Mayor (Jim Backus) , the citizens , among others . Expecting to be an outcast yet again, Pete is cared by the loved Nora (Helen Reddy) who lives in a lighthouse with her daddy Lampy (Mickey Rooney ). And when a phony con disguising as a Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale) and his pal (Red Buttons) arrive in the little town , they see Elliott the Dragon as the ultimate profit to his fortune and money. Enjoyable story that mingles animation with live action . This is a likable sort of a kiddies' adaptation of &uml;Harvey&uml; and another attempt for repeat the Mary Poppins magic . The dragon Elliott steals the show , as itself grins, grunts and botchers around.The primitive but efficient animation is by Don Bluth who subsequently would direct successes as Nimh , Anastasia and Titan A.E. .Colorful and evocative cinematography by cameraman Frank Philips . Agreeable choreography and beautiful songs and musical score by Irwin Kostal. The motion picture is professionally directed by Don Chaffey (Jason and the Argonauts, Lassie , million years B.C ).The children will get a kick out of this Disney musical . Rating : Acceptable and passable.

The performances as you would expect are very cheesy, as is the story, and seeing that mixing cartoon with live action was at the early stage it does look a bit dated, but a couple of the songs, including "Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)", "I Saw a Dragon" and "Brazzle Dazzle Day" are alright, and Elliot is a lovable cartoon character, but I can't really see myself watching this part-animated musical fantasy again. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for "Candle on the Water" and Best Music for Al Kasha, Joel Hirschhorn and Irwin Kostal, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Adequate!

    By the middle/end of the 1970s, the Disney studio was in crisis. Walt had died relatively recently, and the conservative management who ran the company kept on consciously producing films they thought Walt would have made back in the 50s and 60s. As a result, nearly all of the films being produced, at least the live-action ones, were not just throwbacks; they were generally all quite stale with it. "Pete's Dragon" is one such film. It tries to be the next "Mary Poppins" but genuinely fails. Not only does it not live up to that film's legacy, but it hasn't really got any pizazz of its own. The story concerns a young orphan named Pete who runs away from a cruel family of hillbillies with the help of his pet dragon Eliot. Along the way, Eliot, who can turn himself invisible, gets up to mischief, and hilarity ensues. The pair arrive in a small New England town, where Pete ends up staying with a kindly lighthouse keeper named Nora and her lovable drunken father. In keeping with the spirit of replicating "Mary Poppins", the titular dragon character is animated, and the best moments in the film tend to feature him. He is a cute and well animated creation, even if he doesn't quite fit seamlessly into the live-action world around him. However, the story overall is boring and introduces too many elements at the wrong time, and many scenes fail to move the plot along at all (including a scene where the lighthouse keeper and the evil doctor's assistant go to look for Eliot in the cave). Acting and character development are also consistently below average. The musical numbers tend to be overdone, and some of them are just downright awful. Though I saw the standard version many years ago, the version I last watched was the shortened version on the UK's Channel 5, which did a lot of good by shortening or even removing the most long-winded scenes (primarily the musical numbers), but even that didn't do much to diffuse some of the film's problems. Let me state that I did not want to go out of my way to hate this film. I am a big fan of Disney, and I watched "Pete's Dragon" as a child a few times and I quite liked it (even if not to the same extent as "Mary Poppins" or "Bedknobs and Broomsticks"). However, as an intelligent adult, I can see hardly any worth in this film. It seems overall like a mismanaged and highly amateur attempt to make a "Disney classic" based on the elements of more successful previous films.

    Pete (Sean Marshall) is a poor orphan boy who arrives in the small town of Passamaquoddy to escape his cruel, slave-driving adopted parents. The residents are generally nice folk, only they don't take too well to Pete due to his large, mainly invisible dragon named Elliott. The first person to see it is local lovable drunk Lampie (Mickey Rooney), who makes his concerns known only to be laughed at. So Pete is taken in by Lampie's daughter Nora (Helen Reddy), a lighthouse worker who is still pining for her partner who disappeared at sea almost a year prior. Trouble starts to brew though when a medicine wheeler-dealer named Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale) arrives in town and sees profit in the dragon. One of Disney's few attempts to cash in on the success of Mary Poppins (1964), combining live-action with animation, Pete's Dragon is one of their lesser known efforts (although it does have it's nostalgia-filled fanbase). It was made in a time where freckly ginger kids were considered cute and likable child characters, and the adults overacted to the point where they looked like they were presenting a children's TV show. Containing very few memorable songs (if any) and some very shoddy animation, Pete's Dragon is one of Disney's laziest and poorest productions. None of Disney's classic animators (the 'Nine Old Men') worked on the film and it shows. Of what little dragon there is, it appears very little effort or imagination was put into it. Thank the lord then, for Dr. Terminus, played with enjoyable enthusiasm by Jim Dale (who appeared in a few Carry On films) who saves the film from complete embarrassment. He gets the best song 'Passamaquoddy', in which he tries to charm the townsfolk into buying his crap medicine that has already made one of them fat and turned another one of their hair pink, while repeatedly mispronouncing the name of the town. He's like a malpractising Del Boy, and is so enjoyable that I was rooting for him to get his hands on the annoying ginger kid and his crappily animated dragon. Not a total failure then, but instantly forgettable, overlong, excruciatingly squeaky-clean, and exhaustingly enthusiastic. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    I remember at one point in my childhood, I heard about a movie called "Pete's Dragon", maybe when it was about to come on TV, and also remember seeing some of it, though I can't remember how much I saw. There was another part of the film I remember seeing some years later (the part where the Dr. Terminus character manages to win over the initially angry people), but I didn't know what movie I was seeing. After many years, I could still remember the title of this mostly live action Disney film (but one with a cartoon dragon), and finally decided to watch it from start to finish this week. It's far from one of the most highly regarded Disney productions in the long history of the company, and I wasn't expecting it to be among the great ones, but I was expecting it to be better than I found it to be, which is not good at all for the most part. With the help of his magical dragon, Elliott, a young orphaned boy named Pete manages to escape from his cruel adoptive family, the Gogans, but they are still determined to find him somehow or other. The boy and his dragon friend travel together and soon come to a village called Passamaquoddy. Before they enter, Pete tells Elliott that he must make himself invisible (a magical power of his) in order to avoid scaring the people, so the dragon reluctantly does so, but even in his invisible form, he soon causes a lot of trouble in the village, and since nobody can see him, it looks like Pete is responsible! After Pete gets away from an angry mob and Elliott scares Lampie, the drunken lighthouse keeper, the two of them go to a cave near the lighthouse, where Nora, Lampie's daughter, finds Pete and decides to give him shelter in her home. He often talks to her about Elliott, and she doesn't believe that this dragon actually exists, but plays along. Unfortunately, the dragon continues to cause trouble for Pete, and the village of Passamaquoddy has another problem when medicine showman Dr. Terminus and his assistant, Hoagy, are back to swindle the villagers again with their fraudulent formulas! This live action/animation crossover is a musical, and unfortunately, the songs generally don't have much effect. I think this already shows with the first song, sung by the Gogans as they pursue Pete, but it gets worse after the boy and his dragon friend get away from them and we hear the next musical number, "Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)". During this song, I felt like I was watching something strictly for the very young. Basically, the rest of the songs also fail, including the "I Saw a Dragon" one featured in the part where Lampie tells the people in the tavern what he saw, a notably clumsy segment of the film. The musical numbers are only one of the significant flaws in the film. Most of the cast performances failed to impress me, especially Jane Kean overacting in the role of Miss Taylor, the strict teacher of the village. It doesn't seem that Sean Marshall, who plays the title character, was a very good child actor. "Pete's Dragon" does have some pretty funny parts, but not enough to make it really work as a comedy, either. Also, while I certainly didn't find myself not caring what happened to any of the characters, I still didn't find most of the story too entertaining for some reason, but that might have been largely because of the other problems. This is a mainly live action family musical, and maybe I'm not usually into movies like this, but that hasn't stopped me from finding "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory", a live action family musical from six years before this one, to be a great film, so it's definitely not like "Pete's Dragon" would look bad to me regardless of quality. This particular Disney piece came out the same year as "The Rescuers", an all animated feature which disappointed me when I first saw it last year (I actually found its 1990 sequel, "The Rescuers Down Under", to be much better, as rare as that is with sequels and as much as many Disney fans would probably disagree), but even that film I found to be better than this very lacklustre live action/animation crossover. I gave "Pete's Dragon" a try, and realize that it has a following (not a huge one, but it is a following), but simply put, I just didn't like it. I guess I can still recommend it for kids and won't say adults should avoid it at all costs, but I also still think there are good reasons for all the criticism.

    Endearing animated monster movie about a lively dragon and his little friend . The story takes place in Maine circa 1908 , the starring are an orphaned 9-years-old boy named Pete (Sean Marshall) and his sympathetic dragon Elliot . Freckly Pete flee the overbearing foster Gogan family (Shelley Winters , Charles Tyner), who all utilize him as a slave instead of a kind child. When Pete can successfully escape from them with his protective dragon , his only friend , that only can see , then they stumble into the town of Passamaquaddy- an ocean front dock town plenty of fishermen, drunks and rare people . Pete's arrival does not fit well with the townsfolk , as his pale green dragon Elliott accidentally causes town destruction and rioting among the school teacher , the Mayor (Jim Backus) , the citizens , among others . Expecting to be an outcast yet again, Pete is cared by the loved Nora (Helen Reddy) who lives in a lighthouse with her daddy Lampy (Mickey Rooney ). And when a phony con disguising as a Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale) and his pal (Red Buttons) arrive in the little town , they see Elliott the Dragon as the ultimate profit to his fortune and money. Enjoyable story that mingles animation with live action . This is a likable sort of a kiddies' adaptation of &uml;Harvey&uml; and another attempt for repeat the Mary Poppins magic . The dragon Elliott steals the show , as itself grins, grunts and botchers around.The primitive but efficient animation is by Don Bluth who subsequently would direct successes as Nimh , Anastasia and Titan A.E. .Colorful and evocative cinematography by cameraman Frank Philips . Agreeable choreography and beautiful songs and musical score by Irwin Kostal. The motion picture is professionally directed by Don Chaffey (Jason and the Argonauts, Lassie , million years B.C ).The children will get a kick out of this Disney musical . Rating : Acceptable and passable.

    I have never forgotten this movie and some song lyrics where always on my mind for over 20 years. I didn't watch it again for a long time, assuming it is a kid movie, until lately, where I discovered that there is also the long 129 minutes version. Surprisingly, I found myself very entertained even as a an adult! Of course one has a different perspective and there where so many jokes and side remarks that I just didn't get as a kid - it was wonderful to "rediscover" this movie. The ocean scenery is beautiful and the songs - they are just great, sometimes funny, sometimes really touching. This movie is so heart warming, well done for its time and brings along many important messages about friendship, love, tolerance, enjoying life together, but also doing the right thing and stand up for what you believe - just like Nora, my favorite character. I found myself in a very good mood the rest of the day, remembering my childhood and humming "Brazzle Dazzle day" ;-) So what is the definition of a good movie ? A movie you can watch as kid or adult discovering different things, a movie with music & lyrics you never forget and have to sing along, a movie that makes you think and appreciate your loved ones, family and friends but also lifts you up and makes you feel happy ? If that's not the definition of a good movie, then I don't know what is. I will watch it again and again.

    I saw this movie a number of times on HBO, but, Ironically enough, I can't remember too much about it. I remember when it was first advertised for the theatres, and shrugging my shoulders at it as a kids' film. A friend of mine really took to it, but I don't recall anything too extraordinary about it. The old "out of the ink well" animation formula is taken to the extreme when a young boy who comes across a sleepy coastside Hamlet discovers intrigue among the locals. His special medieval mythical fire-breathing (and flying) friend aids him in his search for a family and to right a wrong. To be honest, I never got the whole thing, but it was fun for what it was. Not a film I would own in my collection ... unless the wife and kids wanted it. Don't get me wrong, it's a very fine children's film, my tastes just lie elsewhere. Give it a whirl on the old DVD player, and watch it with the family. Enjoy.

    Like many people, I am in the process of upgrading my collection from VHS to DVD/Blu-Ray. This was on-sale at Amazon. What a surprise! Much better than I remember it. Great songs and cast with great performances by Red Buttons and Mickey Rooney. Shelly Winters plays a wonderfully-horrible villain with "blackout" teeth. A simple story about a dragon that only Pete can see (at first) and clever dragon mechanical effects: Pete riding Elliott, toasting apples, dragon footprints, his "outline" on the schoolhouse wall, thrashing around inside a whale-sized net. The dragon animation by Don Bluth is fanciful, which is good because this is a children's' movie. Some technical glitches, as the "yellowscreen" (sodium vapor) process renders Elliott the Dragon somewhat transparent and prone to color-shifts. But this is not something that kids care about anyway. Although "Candle on the Water" is the Oscar-wining song, I bet you start humming "Brazzle-Dazzle Day" as the movie ends!

    This is one of the best musicals of all time, right up there with The Sound of Music. Yes, I have a lot of nostalgia as I had this on Betamax growing up and wore it out... but now I'm watching it with my own kids and they love it just like I did. This movie holds up and translates well to all generations. The songs are fantastic, but my least favorite is the one it may be most known for (Candle on the water). Lampie... Doc Terminus... they're all just really, really good performances of well written songs. It has everything a musical needs. Great acting, great singing, great choreography, great story, and a lot of heart. The live action/animation is really good for the time, so there's no reason to get hung up on that. Plus Elliot is awesome. I honestly can't understand how this is under 9 stars.

    Pete is a small boy running away from slavery with an abusive hillbilly family who have "bought" him. He falls in with an invisible dragon and a lighthouse keeper and his daughter, and assorted good and bad things happen. This Disney offering is one of the more forgotten live action movies despite the fact that it has quite a lot going for it. It is colourful, daft, has a good moral heart, some excellent villains, decent songs, and decent effects (both physical effects and traditional animation). The performances are all good, with Helen Reddy doing well in her only movie lead role, and young Sean Marshall's sincerity outweighing his winsome cuteness. This is still a good family film.

    I had seen the iconic image of the little ginger kid and the title character, I do remember at one time seeing a couple of clips as well, it was just a case of watching the actual early Disney animation and live action film, from director Don Chaffey (Jason and the Argonauts, One Million Years B.C.). Basically, set in early 20th Century New England, nine year old orphan boy Pete (Sean Marshall) has escaped his abusive adoptive parents, the Gorgans, led by the nasty mother Lena (Shelley Winters). His only true friend is the one who found him, a large green and purple haired and winged fire breathing cartoon dragon named Elliott (the grunts and roars voiced by Charlie Callas), and whenever he can't be seen he can turn himself invisible. Pete and Elliot have travelled to Passamaquoddy, Maine, an ocean front harbour town, filled with superstitious fishermen, drunken hooligans and wary townsfolk, and they try to find somewhere to settle, the invisible dragon obviously causing some destruction. Eventually Pete meets Nora (Helen Reddy), the daughter of drunken lighthouse operator Lampie (Mickey Rooney), he in fact is the only one to see Elliot, but the little boy is allowed to live in the lighthouse, while the dragon hides in the beach cave nearby. The little boy's arrival causes a lot of rumours, rioting and gossip in the town, and this ignites the interest of visiting con artist Dr. Terminus (Carry On's Jim Dale), who believing the dragon superstition is keen to get his hands on it for profit. There comes the point when Elliot is indeed borough out in the open and exposed, even captured, while Pete's horrible adoptive parents the Gogans come back to snatch him. In the end of course the bad guys get what they deserve and are driven away. Peter settles happily in his new home with Nora and Lampy, who did find out about the dragon, and Elliot has to fly away to find another child to help. Also starring Red Buttons as Hoagy, Jim Backus as The Mayor and Jeff Conaway as Willie. The performances as you would expect are very cheesy, as is the story, and seeing that mixing cartoon with live action was at the early stage it does look a bit dated, but a couple of the songs, including "Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)", "I Saw a Dragon" and "Brazzle Dazzle Day" are alright, and Elliot is a lovable cartoon character, but I can't really see myself watching this part-animated musical fantasy again. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for "Candle on the Water" and Best Music for Al Kasha, Joel Hirschhorn and Irwin Kostal, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Adequate!

The story takes place in Maine circa 1908 , the starring are an orphaned 9-years-old boy named Pete (Sean Marshall) and his sympathetic dragon Elliot . Freckly Pete flee the overbearing foster Gogan family (Shelley Winters , Charles Tyner), who all utilize him as a slave instead of a kind child. When Pete can successfully escape from them with his protective dragon , his only friend , that only can see , then they stumble into the town of Passamaquaddy- an ocean front dock town plenty of fishermen, drunks and rare people . Pete's arrival does not fit well with the townsfolk , as his pale green dragon Elliott accidentally causes town destruction and rioting among the school teacher , the Mayor (Jim Backus) , the citizens , among others .

    I have never forgotten this movie and some song lyrics where always on my mind for over 20 years. I didn't watch it again for a long time, assuming it is a kid movie, until lately, where I discovered that there is also the long 129 minutes version. Surprisingly, I found myself very entertained even as a an adult! Of course one has a different perspective and there where so many jokes and side remarks that I just didn't get as a kid - it was wonderful to "rediscover" this movie. The ocean scenery is beautiful and the songs - they are just great, sometimes funny, sometimes really touching. This movie is so heart warming, well done for its time and brings along many important messages about friendship, love, tolerance, enjoying life together, but also doing the right thing and stand up for what you believe - just like Nora, my favorite character. I found myself in a very good mood the rest of the day, remembering my childhood and humming "Brazzle Dazzle day" ;-) So what is the definition of a good movie ? A movie you can watch as kid or adult discovering different things, a movie with music & lyrics you never forget and have to sing along, a movie that makes you think and appreciate your loved ones, family and friends but also lifts you up and makes you feel happy ? If that's not the definition of a good movie, then I don't know what is. I will watch it again and again.

    I saw this movie a number of times on HBO, but, Ironically enough, I can't remember too much about it. I remember when it was first advertised for the theatres, and shrugging my shoulders at it as a kids' film. A friend of mine really took to it, but I don't recall anything too extraordinary about it. The old "out of the ink well" animation formula is taken to the extreme when a young boy who comes across a sleepy coastside Hamlet discovers intrigue among the locals. His special medieval mythical fire-breathing (and flying) friend aids him in his search for a family and to right a wrong. To be honest, I never got the whole thing, but it was fun for what it was. Not a film I would own in my collection ... unless the wife and kids wanted it. Don't get me wrong, it's a very fine children's film, my tastes just lie elsewhere. Give it a whirl on the old DVD player, and watch it with the family. Enjoy.

    Like many people, I am in the process of upgrading my collection from VHS to DVD/Blu-Ray. This was on-sale at Amazon. What a surprise! Much better than I remember it. Great songs and cast with great performances by Red Buttons and Mickey Rooney. Shelly Winters plays a wonderfully-horrible villain with "blackout" teeth. A simple story about a dragon that only Pete can see (at first) and clever dragon mechanical effects: Pete riding Elliott, toasting apples, dragon footprints, his "outline" on the schoolhouse wall, thrashing around inside a whale-sized net. The dragon animation by Don Bluth is fanciful, which is good because this is a children's' movie. Some technical glitches, as the "yellowscreen" (sodium vapor) process renders Elliott the Dragon somewhat transparent and prone to color-shifts. But this is not something that kids care about anyway. Although "Candle on the Water" is the Oscar-wining song, I bet you start humming "Brazzle-Dazzle Day" as the movie ends!

    This is one of the best musicals of all time, right up there with The Sound of Music. Yes, I have a lot of nostalgia as I had this on Betamax growing up and wore it out... but now I'm watching it with my own kids and they love it just like I did. This movie holds up and translates well to all generations. The songs are fantastic, but my least favorite is the one it may be most known for (Candle on the water). Lampie... Doc Terminus... they're all just really, really good performances of well written songs. It has everything a musical needs. Great acting, great singing, great choreography, great story, and a lot of heart. The live action/animation is really good for the time, so there's no reason to get hung up on that. Plus Elliot is awesome. I honestly can't understand how this is under 9 stars.

    Pete is a small boy running away from slavery with an abusive hillbilly family who have "bought" him. He falls in with an invisible dragon and a lighthouse keeper and his daughter, and assorted good and bad things happen. This Disney offering is one of the more forgotten live action movies despite the fact that it has quite a lot going for it. It is colourful, daft, has a good moral heart, some excellent villains, decent songs, and decent effects (both physical effects and traditional animation). The performances are all good, with Helen Reddy doing well in her only movie lead role, and young Sean Marshall's sincerity outweighing his winsome cuteness. This is still a good family film.

    I had seen the iconic image of the little ginger kid and the title character, I do remember at one time seeing a couple of clips as well, it was just a case of watching the actual early Disney animation and live action film, from director Don Chaffey (Jason and the Argonauts, One Million Years B.C.). Basically, set in early 20th Century New England, nine year old orphan boy Pete (Sean Marshall) has escaped his abusive adoptive parents, the Gorgans, led by the nasty mother Lena (Shelley Winters). His only true friend is the one who found him, a large green and purple haired and winged fire breathing cartoon dragon named Elliott (the grunts and roars voiced by Charlie Callas), and whenever he can't be seen he can turn himself invisible. Pete and Elliot have travelled to Passamaquoddy, Maine, an ocean front harbour town, filled with superstitious fishermen, drunken hooligans and wary townsfolk, and they try to find somewhere to settle, the invisible dragon obviously causing some destruction. Eventually Pete meets Nora (Helen Reddy), the daughter of drunken lighthouse operator Lampie (Mickey Rooney), he in fact is the only one to see Elliot, but the little boy is allowed to live in the lighthouse, while the dragon hides in the beach cave nearby. The little boy's arrival causes a lot of rumours, rioting and gossip in the town, and this ignites the interest of visiting con artist Dr. Terminus (Carry On's Jim Dale), who believing the dragon superstition is keen to get his hands on it for profit. There comes the point when Elliot is indeed borough out in the open and exposed, even captured, while Pete's horrible adoptive parents the Gogans come back to snatch him. In the end of course the bad guys get what they deserve and are driven away. Peter settles happily in his new home with Nora and Lampy, who did find out about the dragon, and Elliot has to fly away to find another child to help. Also starring Red Buttons as Hoagy, Jim Backus as The Mayor and Jeff Conaway as Willie. The performances as you would expect are very cheesy, as is the story, and seeing that mixing cartoon with live action was at the early stage it does look a bit dated, but a couple of the songs, including "Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)", "I Saw a Dragon" and "Brazzle Dazzle Day" are alright, and Elliot is a lovable cartoon character, but I can't really see myself watching this part-animated musical fantasy again. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for "Candle on the Water" and Best Music for Al Kasha, Joel Hirschhorn and Irwin Kostal, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Adequate!

    By the middle/end of the 1970s, the Disney studio was in crisis. Walt had died relatively recently, and the conservative management who ran the company kept on consciously producing films they thought Walt would have made back in the 50s and 60s. As a result, nearly all of the films being produced, at least the live-action ones, were not just throwbacks; they were generally all quite stale with it. "Pete's Dragon" is one such film. It tries to be the next "Mary Poppins" but genuinely fails. Not only does it not live up to that film's legacy, but it hasn't really got any pizazz of its own. The story concerns a young orphan named Pete who runs away from a cruel family of hillbillies with the help of his pet dragon Eliot. Along the way, Eliot, who can turn himself invisible, gets up to mischief, and hilarity ensues. The pair arrive in a small New England town, where Pete ends up staying with a kindly lighthouse keeper named Nora and her lovable drunken father. In keeping with the spirit of replicating "Mary Poppins", the titular dragon character is animated, and the best moments in the film tend to feature him. He is a cute and well animated creation, even if he doesn't quite fit seamlessly into the live-action world around him. However, the story overall is boring and introduces too many elements at the wrong time, and many scenes fail to move the plot along at all (including a scene where the lighthouse keeper and the evil doctor's assistant go to look for Eliot in the cave). Acting and character development are also consistently below average. The musical numbers tend to be overdone, and some of them are just downright awful. Though I saw the standard version many years ago, the version I last watched was the shortened version on the UK's Channel 5, which did a lot of good by shortening or even removing the most long-winded scenes (primarily the musical numbers), but even that didn't do much to diffuse some of the film's problems. Let me state that I did not want to go out of my way to hate this film. I am a big fan of Disney, and I watched "Pete's Dragon" as a child a few times and I quite liked it (even if not to the same extent as "Mary Poppins" or "Bedknobs and Broomsticks"). However, as an intelligent adult, I can see hardly any worth in this film. It seems overall like a mismanaged and highly amateur attempt to make a "Disney classic" based on the elements of more successful previous films.

    Pete (Sean Marshall) is a poor orphan boy who arrives in the small town of Passamaquoddy to escape his cruel, slave-driving adopted parents. The residents are generally nice folk, only they don't take too well to Pete due to his large, mainly invisible dragon named Elliott. The first person to see it is local lovable drunk Lampie (Mickey Rooney), who makes his concerns known only to be laughed at. So Pete is taken in by Lampie's daughter Nora (Helen Reddy), a lighthouse worker who is still pining for her partner who disappeared at sea almost a year prior. Trouble starts to brew though when a medicine wheeler-dealer named Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale) arrives in town and sees profit in the dragon. One of Disney's few attempts to cash in on the success of Mary Poppins (1964), combining live-action with animation, Pete's Dragon is one of their lesser known efforts (although it does have it's nostalgia-filled fanbase). It was made in a time where freckly ginger kids were considered cute and likable child characters, and the adults overacted to the point where they looked like they were presenting a children's TV show. Containing very few memorable songs (if any) and some very shoddy animation, Pete's Dragon is one of Disney's laziest and poorest productions. None of Disney's classic animators (the 'Nine Old Men') worked on the film and it shows. Of what little dragon there is, it appears very little effort or imagination was put into it. Thank the lord then, for Dr. Terminus, played with enjoyable enthusiasm by Jim Dale (who appeared in a few Carry On films) who saves the film from complete embarrassment. He gets the best song 'Passamaquoddy', in which he tries to charm the townsfolk into buying his crap medicine that has already made one of them fat and turned another one of their hair pink, while repeatedly mispronouncing the name of the town. He's like a malpractising Del Boy, and is so enjoyable that I was rooting for him to get his hands on the annoying ginger kid and his crappily animated dragon. Not a total failure then, but instantly forgettable, overlong, excruciatingly squeaky-clean, and exhaustingly enthusiastic. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    I remember at one point in my childhood, I heard about a movie called "Pete's Dragon", maybe when it was about to come on TV, and also remember seeing some of it, though I can't remember how much I saw. There was another part of the film I remember seeing some years later (the part where the Dr. Terminus character manages to win over the initially angry people), but I didn't know what movie I was seeing. After many years, I could still remember the title of this mostly live action Disney film (but one with a cartoon dragon), and finally decided to watch it from start to finish this week. It's far from one of the most highly regarded Disney productions in the long history of the company, and I wasn't expecting it to be among the great ones, but I was expecting it to be better than I found it to be, which is not good at all for the most part. With the help of his magical dragon, Elliott, a young orphaned boy named Pete manages to escape from his cruel adoptive family, the Gogans, but they are still determined to find him somehow or other. The boy and his dragon friend travel together and soon come to a village called Passamaquoddy. Before they enter, Pete tells Elliott that he must make himself invisible (a magical power of his) in order to avoid scaring the people, so the dragon reluctantly does so, but even in his invisible form, he soon causes a lot of trouble in the village, and since nobody can see him, it looks like Pete is responsible! After Pete gets away from an angry mob and Elliott scares Lampie, the drunken lighthouse keeper, the two of them go to a cave near the lighthouse, where Nora, Lampie's daughter, finds Pete and decides to give him shelter in her home. He often talks to her about Elliott, and she doesn't believe that this dragon actually exists, but plays along. Unfortunately, the dragon continues to cause trouble for Pete, and the village of Passamaquoddy has another problem when medicine showman Dr. Terminus and his assistant, Hoagy, are back to swindle the villagers again with their fraudulent formulas! This live action/animation crossover is a musical, and unfortunately, the songs generally don't have much effect. I think this already shows with the first song, sung by the Gogans as they pursue Pete, but it gets worse after the boy and his dragon friend get away from them and we hear the next musical number, "Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)". During this song, I felt like I was watching something strictly for the very young. Basically, the rest of the songs also fail, including the "I Saw a Dragon" one featured in the part where Lampie tells the people in the tavern what he saw, a notably clumsy segment of the film. The musical numbers are only one of the significant flaws in the film. Most of the cast performances failed to impress me, especially Jane Kean overacting in the role of Miss Taylor, the strict teacher of the village. It doesn't seem that Sean Marshall, who plays the title character, was a very good child actor. "Pete's Dragon" does have some pretty funny parts, but not enough to make it really work as a comedy, either. Also, while I certainly didn't find myself not caring what happened to any of the characters, I still didn't find most of the story too entertaining for some reason, but that might have been largely because of the other problems. This is a mainly live action family musical, and maybe I'm not usually into movies like this, but that hasn't stopped me from finding "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory", a live action family musical from six years before this one, to be a great film, so it's definitely not like "Pete's Dragon" would look bad to me regardless of quality. This particular Disney piece came out the same year as "The Rescuers", an all animated feature which disappointed me when I first saw it last year (I actually found its 1990 sequel, "The Rescuers Down Under", to be much better, as rare as that is with sequels and as much as many Disney fans would probably disagree), but even that film I found to be better than this very lacklustre live action/animation crossover. I gave "Pete's Dragon" a try, and realize that it has a following (not a huge one, but it is a following), but simply put, I just didn't like it. I guess I can still recommend it for kids and won't say adults should avoid it at all costs, but I also still think there are good reasons for all the criticism.

It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for "Candle on the Water" and Best Music for Al Kasha, Joel Hirschhorn and Irwin Kostal, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Adequate!

    By the middle/end of the 1970s, the Disney studio was in crisis. Walt had died relatively recently, and the conservative management who ran the company kept on consciously producing films they thought Walt would have made back in the 50s and 60s. As a result, nearly all of the films being produced, at least the live-action ones, were not just throwbacks; they were generally all quite stale with it. "Pete's Dragon" is one such film. It tries to be the next "Mary Poppins" but genuinely fails. Not only does it not live up to that film's legacy, but it hasn't really got any pizazz of its own. The story concerns a young orphan named Pete who runs away from a cruel family of hillbillies with the help of his pet dragon Eliot. Along the way, Eliot, who can turn himself invisible, gets up to mischief, and hilarity ensues. The pair arrive in a small New England town, where Pete ends up staying with a kindly lighthouse keeper named Nora and her lovable drunken father. In keeping with the spirit of replicating "Mary Poppins", the titular dragon character is animated, and the best moments in the film tend to feature him. He is a cute and well animated creation, even if he doesn't quite fit seamlessly into the live-action world around him. However, the story overall is boring and introduces too many elements at the wrong time, and many scenes fail to move the plot along at all (including a scene where the lighthouse keeper and the evil doctor's assistant go to look for Eliot in the cave). Acting and character development are also consistently below average. The musical numbers tend to be overdone, and some of them are just downright awful. Though I saw the standard version many years ago, the version I last watched was the shortened version on the UK's Channel 5, which did a lot of good by shortening or even removing the most long-winded scenes (primarily the musical numbers), but even that didn't do much to diffuse some of the film's problems. Let me state that I did not want to go out of my way to hate this film. I am a big fan of Disney, and I watched "Pete's Dragon" as a child a few times and I quite liked it (even if not to the same extent as "Mary Poppins" or "Bedknobs and Broomsticks"). However, as an intelligent adult, I can see hardly any worth in this film. It seems overall like a mismanaged and highly amateur attempt to make a "Disney classic" based on the elements of more successful previous films.

    Pete (Sean Marshall) is a poor orphan boy who arrives in the small town of Passamaquoddy to escape his cruel, slave-driving adopted parents. The residents are generally nice folk, only they don't take too well to Pete due to his large, mainly invisible dragon named Elliott. The first person to see it is local lovable drunk Lampie (Mickey Rooney), who makes his concerns known only to be laughed at. So Pete is taken in by Lampie's daughter Nora (Helen Reddy), a lighthouse worker who is still pining for her partner who disappeared at sea almost a year prior. Trouble starts to brew though when a medicine wheeler-dealer named Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale) arrives in town and sees profit in the dragon. One of Disney's few attempts to cash in on the success of Mary Poppins (1964), combining live-action with animation, Pete's Dragon is one of their lesser known efforts (although it does have it's nostalgia-filled fanbase). It was made in a time where freckly ginger kids were considered cute and likable child characters, and the adults overacted to the point where they looked like they were presenting a children's TV show. Containing very few memorable songs (if any) and some very shoddy animation, Pete's Dragon is one of Disney's laziest and poorest productions. None of Disney's classic animators (the 'Nine Old Men') worked on the film and it shows. Of what little dragon there is, it appears very little effort or imagination was put into it. Thank the lord then, for Dr. Terminus, played with enjoyable enthusiasm by Jim Dale (who appeared in a few Carry On films) who saves the film from complete embarrassment. He gets the best song 'Passamaquoddy', in which he tries to charm the townsfolk into buying his crap medicine that has already made one of them fat and turned another one of their hair pink, while repeatedly mispronouncing the name of the town. He's like a malpractising Del Boy, and is so enjoyable that I was rooting for him to get his hands on the annoying ginger kid and his crappily animated dragon. Not a total failure then, but instantly forgettable, overlong, excruciatingly squeaky-clean, and exhaustingly enthusiastic. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    I remember at one point in my childhood, I heard about a movie called "Pete's Dragon", maybe when it was about to come on TV, and also remember seeing some of it, though I can't remember how much I saw. There was another part of the film I remember seeing some years later (the part where the Dr. Terminus character manages to win over the initially angry people), but I didn't know what movie I was seeing. After many years, I could still remember the title of this mostly live action Disney film (but one with a cartoon dragon), and finally decided to watch it from start to finish this week. It's far from one of the most highly regarded Disney productions in the long history of the company, and I wasn't expecting it to be among the great ones, but I was expecting it to be better than I found it to be, which is not good at all for the most part. With the help of his magical dragon, Elliott, a young orphaned boy named Pete manages to escape from his cruel adoptive family, the Gogans, but they are still determined to find him somehow or other. The boy and his dragon friend travel together and soon come to a village called Passamaquoddy. Before they enter, Pete tells Elliott that he must make himself invisible (a magical power of his) in order to avoid scaring the people, so the dragon reluctantly does so, but even in his invisible form, he soon causes a lot of trouble in the village, and since nobody can see him, it looks like Pete is responsible! After Pete gets away from an angry mob and Elliott scares Lampie, the drunken lighthouse keeper, the two of them go to a cave near the lighthouse, where Nora, Lampie's daughter, finds Pete and decides to give him shelter in her home. He often talks to her about Elliott, and she doesn't believe that this dragon actually exists, but plays along. Unfortunately, the dragon continues to cause trouble for Pete, and the village of Passamaquoddy has another problem when medicine showman Dr. Terminus and his assistant, Hoagy, are back to swindle the villagers again with their fraudulent formulas! This live action/animation crossover is a musical, and unfortunately, the songs generally don't have much effect. I think this already shows with the first song, sung by the Gogans as they pursue Pete, but it gets worse after the boy and his dragon friend get away from them and we hear the next musical number, "Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)". During this song, I felt like I was watching something strictly for the very young. Basically, the rest of the songs also fail, including the "I Saw a Dragon" one featured in the part where Lampie tells the people in the tavern what he saw, a notably clumsy segment of the film. The musical numbers are only one of the significant flaws in the film. Most of the cast performances failed to impress me, especially Jane Kean overacting in the role of Miss Taylor, the strict teacher of the village. It doesn't seem that Sean Marshall, who plays the title character, was a very good child actor. "Pete's Dragon" does have some pretty funny parts, but not enough to make it really work as a comedy, either. Also, while I certainly didn't find myself not caring what happened to any of the characters, I still didn't find most of the story too entertaining for some reason, but that might have been largely because of the other problems. This is a mainly live action family musical, and maybe I'm not usually into movies like this, but that hasn't stopped me from finding "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory", a live action family musical from six years before this one, to be a great film, so it's definitely not like "Pete's Dragon" would look bad to me regardless of quality. This particular Disney piece came out the same year as "The Rescuers", an all animated feature which disappointed me when I first saw it last year (I actually found its 1990 sequel, "The Rescuers Down Under", to be much better, as rare as that is with sequels and as much as many Disney fans would probably disagree), but even that film I found to be better than this very lacklustre live action/animation crossover. I gave "Pete's Dragon" a try, and realize that it has a following (not a huge one, but it is a following), but simply put, I just didn't like it. I guess I can still recommend it for kids and won't say adults should avoid it at all costs, but I also still think there are good reasons for all the criticism.

    Endearing animated monster movie about a lively dragon and his little friend . The story takes place in Maine circa 1908 , the starring are an orphaned 9-years-old boy named Pete (Sean Marshall) and his sympathetic dragon Elliot . Freckly Pete flee the overbearing foster Gogan family (Shelley Winters , Charles Tyner), who all utilize him as a slave instead of a kind child. When Pete can successfully escape from them with his protective dragon , his only friend , that only can see , then they stumble into the town of Passamaquaddy- an ocean front dock town plenty of fishermen, drunks and rare people . Pete's arrival does not fit well with the townsfolk , as his pale green dragon Elliott accidentally causes town destruction and rioting among the school teacher , the Mayor (Jim Backus) , the citizens , among others . Expecting to be an outcast yet again, Pete is cared by the loved Nora (Helen Reddy) who lives in a lighthouse with her daddy Lampy (Mickey Rooney ). And when a phony con disguising as a Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale) and his pal (Red Buttons) arrive in the little town , they see Elliott the Dragon as the ultimate profit to his fortune and money. Enjoyable story that mingles animation with live action . This is a likable sort of a kiddies' adaptation of &uml;Harvey&uml; and another attempt for repeat the Mary Poppins magic . The dragon Elliott steals the show , as itself grins, grunts and botchers around.The primitive but efficient animation is by Don Bluth who subsequently would direct successes as Nimh , Anastasia and Titan A.E. .Colorful and evocative cinematography by cameraman Frank Philips . Agreeable choreography and beautiful songs and musical score by Irwin Kostal. The motion picture is professionally directed by Don Chaffey (Jason and the Argonauts, Lassie , million years B.C ).The children will get a kick out of this Disney musical . Rating : Acceptable and passable.

    I have never forgotten this movie and some song lyrics where always on my mind for over 20 years. I didn't watch it again for a long time, assuming it is a kid movie, until lately, where I discovered that there is also the long 129 minutes version. Surprisingly, I found myself very entertained even as a an adult! Of course one has a different perspective and there where so many jokes and side remarks that I just didn't get as a kid - it was wonderful to "rediscover" this movie. The ocean scenery is beautiful and the songs - they are just great, sometimes funny, sometimes really touching. This movie is so heart warming, well done for its time and brings along many important messages about friendship, love, tolerance, enjoying life together, but also doing the right thing and stand up for what you believe - just like Nora, my favorite character. I found myself in a very good mood the rest of the day, remembering my childhood and humming "Brazzle Dazzle day" ;-) So what is the definition of a good movie ? A movie you can watch as kid or adult discovering different things, a movie with music & lyrics you never forget and have to sing along, a movie that makes you think and appreciate your loved ones, family and friends but also lifts you up and makes you feel happy ? If that's not the definition of a good movie, then I don't know what is. I will watch it again and again.

    I saw this movie a number of times on HBO, but, Ironically enough, I can't remember too much about it. I remember when it was first advertised for the theatres, and shrugging my shoulders at it as a kids' film. A friend of mine really took to it, but I don't recall anything too extraordinary about it. The old "out of the ink well" animation formula is taken to the extreme when a young boy who comes across a sleepy coastside Hamlet discovers intrigue among the locals. His special medieval mythical fire-breathing (and flying) friend aids him in his search for a family and to right a wrong. To be honest, I never got the whole thing, but it was fun for what it was. Not a film I would own in my collection ... unless the wife and kids wanted it. Don't get me wrong, it's a very fine children's film, my tastes just lie elsewhere. Give it a whirl on the old DVD player, and watch it with the family. Enjoy.

    Like many people, I am in the process of upgrading my collection from VHS to DVD/Blu-Ray. This was on-sale at Amazon. What a surprise! Much better than I remember it. Great songs and cast with great performances by Red Buttons and Mickey Rooney. Shelly Winters plays a wonderfully-horrible villain with "blackout" teeth. A simple story about a dragon that only Pete can see (at first) and clever dragon mechanical effects: Pete riding Elliott, toasting apples, dragon footprints, his "outline" on the schoolhouse wall, thrashing around inside a whale-sized net. The dragon animation by Don Bluth is fanciful, which is good because this is a children's' movie. Some technical glitches, as the "yellowscreen" (sodium vapor) process renders Elliott the Dragon somewhat transparent and prone to color-shifts. But this is not something that kids care about anyway. Although "Candle on the Water" is the Oscar-wining song, I bet you start humming "Brazzle-Dazzle Day" as the movie ends!

    This is one of the best musicals of all time, right up there with The Sound of Music. Yes, I have a lot of nostalgia as I had this on Betamax growing up and wore it out... but now I'm watching it with my own kids and they love it just like I did. This movie holds up and translates well to all generations. The songs are fantastic, but my least favorite is the one it may be most known for (Candle on the water). Lampie... Doc Terminus... they're all just really, really good performances of well written songs. It has everything a musical needs. Great acting, great singing, great choreography, great story, and a lot of heart. The live action/animation is really good for the time, so there's no reason to get hung up on that. Plus Elliot is awesome. I honestly can't understand how this is under 9 stars.

    Pete is a small boy running away from slavery with an abusive hillbilly family who have "bought" him. He falls in with an invisible dragon and a lighthouse keeper and his daughter, and assorted good and bad things happen. This Disney offering is one of the more forgotten live action movies despite the fact that it has quite a lot going for it. It is colourful, daft, has a good moral heart, some excellent villains, decent songs, and decent effects (both physical effects and traditional animation). The performances are all good, with Helen Reddy doing well in her only movie lead role, and young Sean Marshall's sincerity outweighing his winsome cuteness. This is still a good family film.

    I had seen the iconic image of the little ginger kid and the title character, I do remember at one time seeing a couple of clips as well, it was just a case of watching the actual early Disney animation and live action film, from director Don Chaffey (Jason and the Argonauts, One Million Years B.C.). Basically, set in early 20th Century New England, nine year old orphan boy Pete (Sean Marshall) has escaped his abusive adoptive parents, the Gorgans, led by the nasty mother Lena (Shelley Winters). His only true friend is the one who found him, a large green and purple haired and winged fire breathing cartoon dragon named Elliott (the grunts and roars voiced by Charlie Callas), and whenever he can't be seen he can turn himself invisible. Pete and Elliot have travelled to Passamaquoddy, Maine, an ocean front harbour town, filled with superstitious fishermen, drunken hooligans and wary townsfolk, and they try to find somewhere to settle, the invisible dragon obviously causing some destruction. Eventually Pete meets Nora (Helen Reddy), the daughter of drunken lighthouse operator Lampie (Mickey Rooney), he in fact is the only one to see Elliot, but the little boy is allowed to live in the lighthouse, while the dragon hides in the beach cave nearby. The little boy's arrival causes a lot of rumours, rioting and gossip in the town, and this ignites the interest of visiting con artist Dr. Terminus (Carry On's Jim Dale), who believing the dragon superstition is keen to get his hands on it for profit. There comes the point when Elliot is indeed borough out in the open and exposed, even captured, while Pete's horrible adoptive parents the Gogans come back to snatch him. In the end of course the bad guys get what they deserve and are driven away. Peter settles happily in his new home with Nora and Lampy, who did find out about the dragon, and Elliot has to fly away to find another child to help. Also starring Red Buttons as Hoagy, Jim Backus as The Mayor and Jeff Conaway as Willie. The performances as you would expect are very cheesy, as is the story, and seeing that mixing cartoon with live action was at the early stage it does look a bit dated, but a couple of the songs, including "Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)", "I Saw a Dragon" and "Brazzle Dazzle Day" are alright, and Elliot is a lovable cartoon character, but I can't really see myself watching this part-animated musical fantasy again. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for "Candle on the Water" and Best Music for Al Kasha, Joel Hirschhorn and Irwin Kostal, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Adequate!

    I have never forgotten this movie and some song lyrics where always on my mind for over 20 years. I didn't watch it again for a long time, assuming it is a kid movie, until lately, where I discovered that there is also the long 129 minutes version. Surprisingly, I found myself very entertained even as a an adult! Of course one has a different perspective and there where so many jokes and side remarks that I just didn't get as a kid - it was wonderful to "rediscover" this movie. The ocean scenery is beautiful and the songs - they are just great, sometimes funny, sometimes really touching. This movie is so heart warming, well done for its time and brings along many important messages about friendship, love, tolerance, enjoying life together, but also doing the right thing and stand up for what you believe - just like Nora, my favorite character. I found myself in a very good mood the rest of the day, remembering my childhood and humming "Brazzle Dazzle day" ;-) So what is the definition of a good movie ? A movie you can watch as kid or adult discovering different things, a movie with music & lyrics you never forget and have to sing along, a movie that makes you think and appreciate your loved ones, family and friends but also lifts you up and makes you feel happy ? If that's not the definition of a good movie, then I don't know what is. I will watch it again and again.

    I saw this movie a number of times on HBO, but, Ironically enough, I can't remember too much about it. I remember when it was first advertised for the theatres, and shrugging my shoulders at it as a kids' film. A friend of mine really took to it, but I don't recall anything too extraordinary about it. The old "out of the ink well" animation formula is taken to the extreme when a young boy who comes across a sleepy coastside Hamlet discovers intrigue among the locals. His special medieval mythical fire-breathing (and flying) friend aids him in his search for a family and to right a wrong. To be honest, I never got the whole thing, but it was fun for what it was. Not a film I would own in my collection ... unless the wife and kids wanted it. Don't get me wrong, it's a very fine children's film, my tastes just lie elsewhere. Give it a whirl on the old DVD player, and watch it with the family. Enjoy.

    Like many people, I am in the process of upgrading my collection from VHS to DVD/Blu-Ray. This was on-sale at Amazon. What a surprise! Much better than I remember it. Great songs and cast with great performances by Red Buttons and Mickey Rooney. Shelly Winters plays a wonderfully-horrible villain with "blackout" teeth. A simple story about a dragon that only Pete can see (at first) and clever dragon mechanical effects: Pete riding Elliott, toasting apples, dragon footprints, his "outline" on the schoolhouse wall, thrashing around inside a whale-sized net. The dragon animation by Don Bluth is fanciful, which is good because this is a children's' movie. Some technical glitches, as the "yellowscreen" (sodium vapor) process renders Elliott the Dragon somewhat transparent and prone to color-shifts. But this is not something that kids care about anyway. Although "Candle on the Water" is the Oscar-wining song, I bet you start humming "Brazzle-Dazzle Day" as the movie ends!

    This is one of the best musicals of all time, right up there with The Sound of Music. Yes, I have a lot of nostalgia as I had this on Betamax growing up and wore it out... but now I'm watching it with my own kids and they love it just like I did. This movie holds up and translates well to all generations. The songs are fantastic, but my least favorite is the one it may be most known for (Candle on the water). Lampie... Doc Terminus... they're all just really, really good performances of well written songs. It has everything a musical needs. Great acting, great singing, great choreography, great story, and a lot of heart. The live action/animation is really good for the time, so there's no reason to get hung up on that. Plus Elliot is awesome. I honestly can't understand how this is under 9 stars.

    Pete is a small boy running away from slavery with an abusive hillbilly family who have "bought" him. He falls in with an invisible dragon and a lighthouse keeper and his daughter, and assorted good and bad things happen. This Disney offering is one of the more forgotten live action movies despite the fact that it has quite a lot going for it. It is colourful, daft, has a good moral heart, some excellent villains, decent songs, and decent effects (both physical effects and traditional animation). The performances are all good, with Helen Reddy doing well in her only movie lead role, and young Sean Marshall's sincerity outweighing his winsome cuteness. This is still a good family film.

    I had seen the iconic image of the little ginger kid and the title character, I do remember at one time seeing a couple of clips as well, it was just a case of watching the actual early Disney animation and live action film, from director Don Chaffey (Jason and the Argonauts, One Million Years B.C.). Basically, set in early 20th Century New England, nine year old orphan boy Pete (Sean Marshall) has escaped his abusive adoptive parents, the Gorgans, led by the nasty mother Lena (Shelley Winters). His only true friend is the one who found him, a large green and purple haired and winged fire breathing cartoon dragon named Elliott (the grunts and roars voiced by Charlie Callas), and whenever he can't be seen he can turn himself invisible. Pete and Elliot have travelled to Passamaquoddy, Maine, an ocean front harbour town, filled with superstitious fishermen, drunken hooligans and wary townsfolk, and they try to find somewhere to settle, the invisible dragon obviously causing some destruction. Eventually Pete meets Nora (Helen Reddy), the daughter of drunken lighthouse operator Lampie (Mickey Rooney), he in fact is the only one to see Elliot, but the little boy is allowed to live in the lighthouse, while the dragon hides in the beach cave nearby. The little boy's arrival causes a lot of rumours, rioting and gossip in the town, and this ignites the interest of visiting con artist Dr. Terminus (Carry On's Jim Dale), who believing the dragon superstition is keen to get his hands on it for profit. There comes the point when Elliot is indeed borough out in the open and exposed, even captured, while Pete's horrible adoptive parents the Gogans come back to snatch him. In the end of course the bad guys get what they deserve and are driven away. Peter settles happily in his new home with Nora and Lampy, who did find out about the dragon, and Elliot has to fly away to find another child to help. Also starring Red Buttons as Hoagy, Jim Backus as The Mayor and Jeff Conaway as Willie. The performances as you would expect are very cheesy, as is the story, and seeing that mixing cartoon with live action was at the early stage it does look a bit dated, but a couple of the songs, including "Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)", "I Saw a Dragon" and "Brazzle Dazzle Day" are alright, and Elliot is a lovable cartoon character, but I can't really see myself watching this part-animated musical fantasy again. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for "Candle on the Water" and Best Music for Al Kasha, Joel Hirschhorn and Irwin Kostal, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Adequate!

    By the middle/end of the 1970s, the Disney studio was in crisis. Walt had died relatively recently, and the conservative management who ran the company kept on consciously producing films they thought Walt would have made back in the 50s and 60s. As a result, nearly all of the films being produced, at least the live-action ones, were not just throwbacks; they were generally all quite stale with it. "Pete's Dragon" is one such film. It tries to be the next "Mary Poppins" but genuinely fails. Not only does it not live up to that film's legacy, but it hasn't really got any pizazz of its own. The story concerns a young orphan named Pete who runs away from a cruel family of hillbillies with the help of his pet dragon Eliot. Along the way, Eliot, who can turn himself invisible, gets up to mischief, and hilarity ensues. The pair arrive in a small New England town, where Pete ends up staying with a kindly lighthouse keeper named Nora and her lovable drunken father. In keeping with the spirit of replicating "Mary Poppins", the titular dragon character is animated, and the best moments in the film tend to feature him. He is a cute and well animated creation, even if he doesn't quite fit seamlessly into the live-action world around him. However, the story overall is boring and introduces too many elements at the wrong time, and many scenes fail to move the plot along at all (including a scene where the lighthouse keeper and the evil doctor's assistant go to look for Eliot in the cave). Acting and character development are also consistently below average. The musical numbers tend to be overdone, and some of them are just downright awful. Though I saw the standard version many years ago, the version I last watched was the shortened version on the UK's Channel 5, which did a lot of good by shortening or even removing the most long-winded scenes (primarily the musical numbers), but even that didn't do much to diffuse some of the film's problems. Let me state that I did not want to go out of my way to hate this film. I am a big fan of Disney, and I watched "Pete's Dragon" as a child a few times and I quite liked it (even if not to the same extent as "Mary Poppins" or "Bedknobs and Broomsticks"). However, as an intelligent adult, I can see hardly any worth in this film. It seems overall like a mismanaged and highly amateur attempt to make a "Disney classic" based on the elements of more successful previous films.

    Pete (Sean Marshall) is a poor orphan boy who arrives in the small town of Passamaquoddy to escape his cruel, slave-driving adopted parents. The residents are generally nice folk, only they don't take too well to Pete due to his large, mainly invisible dragon named Elliott. The first person to see it is local lovable drunk Lampie (Mickey Rooney), who makes his concerns known only to be laughed at. So Pete is taken in by Lampie's daughter Nora (Helen Reddy), a lighthouse worker who is still pining for her partner who disappeared at sea almost a year prior. Trouble starts to brew though when a medicine wheeler-dealer named Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale) arrives in town and sees profit in the dragon. One of Disney's few attempts to cash in on the success of Mary Poppins (1964), combining live-action with animation, Pete's Dragon is one of their lesser known efforts (although it does have it's nostalgia-filled fanbase). It was made in a time where freckly ginger kids were considered cute and likable child characters, and the adults overacted to the point where they looked like they were presenting a children's TV show. Containing very few memorable songs (if any) and some very shoddy animation, Pete's Dragon is one of Disney's laziest and poorest productions. None of Disney's classic animators (the 'Nine Old Men') worked on the film and it shows. Of what little dragon there is, it appears very little effort or imagination was put into it. Thank the lord then, for Dr. Terminus, played with enjoyable enthusiasm by Jim Dale (who appeared in a few Carry On films) who saves the film from complete embarrassment. He gets the best song 'Passamaquoddy', in which he tries to charm the townsfolk into buying his crap medicine that has already made one of them fat and turned another one of their hair pink, while repeatedly mispronouncing the name of the town. He's like a malpractising Del Boy, and is so enjoyable that I was rooting for him to get his hands on the annoying ginger kid and his crappily animated dragon. Not a total failure then, but instantly forgettable, overlong, excruciatingly squeaky-clean, and exhaustingly enthusiastic. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    I remember at one point in my childhood, I heard about a movie called "Pete's Dragon", maybe when it was about to come on TV, and also remember seeing some of it, though I can't remember how much I saw. There was another part of the film I remember seeing some years later (the part where the Dr. Terminus character manages to win over the initially angry people), but I didn't know what movie I was seeing. After many years, I could still remember the title of this mostly live action Disney film (but one with a cartoon dragon), and finally decided to watch it from start to finish this week. It's far from one of the most highly regarded Disney productions in the long history of the company, and I wasn't expecting it to be among the great ones, but I was expecting it to be better than I found it to be, which is not good at all for the most part. With the help of his magical dragon, Elliott, a young orphaned boy named Pete manages to escape from his cruel adoptive family, the Gogans, but they are still determined to find him somehow or other. The boy and his dragon friend travel together and soon come to a village called Passamaquoddy. Before they enter, Pete tells Elliott that he must make himself invisible (a magical power of his) in order to avoid scaring the people, so the dragon reluctantly does so, but even in his invisible form, he soon causes a lot of trouble in the village, and since nobody can see him, it looks like Pete is responsible! After Pete gets away from an angry mob and Elliott scares Lampie, the drunken lighthouse keeper, the two of them go to a cave near the lighthouse, where Nora, Lampie's daughter, finds Pete and decides to give him shelter in her home. He often talks to her about Elliott, and she doesn't believe that this dragon actually exists, but plays along. Unfortunately, the dragon continues to cause trouble for Pete, and the village of Passamaquoddy has another problem when medicine showman Dr. Terminus and his assistant, Hoagy, are back to swindle the villagers again with their fraudulent formulas! This live action/animation crossover is a musical, and unfortunately, the songs generally don't have much effect. I think this already shows with the first song, sung by the Gogans as they pursue Pete, but it gets worse after the boy and his dragon friend get away from them and we hear the next musical number, "Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)". During this song, I felt like I was watching something strictly for the very young. Basically, the rest of the songs also fail, including the "I Saw a Dragon" one featured in the part where Lampie tells the people in the tavern what he saw, a notably clumsy segment of the film. The musical numbers are only one of the significant flaws in the film. Most of the cast performances failed to impress me, especially Jane Kean overacting in the role of Miss Taylor, the strict teacher of the village. It doesn't seem that Sean Marshall, who plays the title character, was a very good child actor. "Pete's Dragon" does have some pretty funny parts, but not enough to make it really work as a comedy, either. Also, while I certainly didn't find myself not caring what happened to any of the characters, I still didn't find most of the story too entertaining for some reason, but that might have been largely because of the other problems. This is a mainly live action family musical, and maybe I'm not usually into movies like this, but that hasn't stopped me from finding "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory", a live action family musical from six years before this one, to be a great film, so it's definitely not like "Pete's Dragon" would look bad to me regardless of quality. This particular Disney piece came out the same year as "The Rescuers", an all animated feature which disappointed me when I first saw it last year (I actually found its 1990 sequel, "The Rescuers Down Under", to be much better, as rare as that is with sequels and as much as many Disney fans would probably disagree), but even that film I found to be better than this very lacklustre live action/animation crossover. I gave "Pete's Dragon" a try, and realize that it has a following (not a huge one, but it is a following), but simply put, I just didn't like it. I guess I can still recommend it for kids and won't say adults should avoid it at all costs, but I also still think there are good reasons for all the criticism.

It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for "Candle on the Water" and Best Music for Al Kasha, Joel Hirschhorn and Irwin Kostal, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Adequate!

    By the middle/end of the 1970s, the Disney studio was in crisis. Walt had died relatively recently, and the conservative management who ran the company kept on consciously producing films they thought Walt would have made back in the 50s and 60s. As a result, nearly all of the films being produced, at least the live-action ones, were not just throwbacks; they were generally all quite stale with it. "Pete's Dragon" is one such film. It tries to be the next "Mary Poppins" but genuinely fails. Not only does it not live up to that film's legacy, but it hasn't really got any pizazz of its own. The story concerns a young orphan named Pete who runs away from a cruel family of hillbillies with the help of his pet dragon Eliot. Along the way, Eliot, who can turn himself invisible, gets up to mischief, and hilarity ensues. The pair arrive in a small New England town, where Pete ends up staying with a kindly lighthouse keeper named Nora and her lovable drunken father. In keeping with the spirit of replicating "Mary Poppins", the titular dragon character is animated, and the best moments in the film tend to feature him. He is a cute and well animated creation, even if he doesn't quite fit seamlessly into the live-action world around him. However, the story overall is boring and introduces too many elements at the wrong time, and many scenes fail to move the plot along at all (including a scene where the lighthouse keeper and the evil doctor's assistant go to look for Eliot in the cave). Acting and character development are also consistently below average. The musical numbers tend to be overdone, and some of them are just downright awful. Though I saw the standard version many years ago, the version I last watched was the shortened version on the UK's Channel 5, which did a lot of good by shortening or even removing the most long-winded scenes (primarily the musical numbers), but even that didn't do much to diffuse some of the film's problems. Let me state that I did not want to go out of my way to hate this film. I am a big fan of Disney, and I watched "Pete's Dragon" as a child a few times and I quite liked it (even if not to the same extent as "Mary Poppins" or "Bedknobs and Broomsticks"). However, as an intelligent adult, I can see hardly any worth in this film. It seems overall like a mismanaged and highly amateur attempt to make a "Disney classic" based on the elements of more successful previous films.

    Pete (Sean Marshall) is a poor orphan boy who arrives in the small town of Passamaquoddy to escape his cruel, slave-driving adopted parents. The residents are generally nice folk, only they don't take too well to Pete due to his large, mainly invisible dragon named Elliott. The first person to see it is local lovable drunk Lampie (Mickey Rooney), who makes his concerns known only to be laughed at. So Pete is taken in by Lampie's daughter Nora (Helen Reddy), a lighthouse worker who is still pining for her partner who disappeared at sea almost a year prior. Trouble starts to brew though when a medicine wheeler-dealer named Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale) arrives in town and sees profit in the dragon. One of Disney's few attempts to cash in on the success of Mary Poppins (1964), combining live-action with animation, Pete's Dragon is one of their lesser known efforts (although it does have it's nostalgia-filled fanbase). It was made in a time where freckly ginger kids were considered cute and likable child characters, and the adults overacted to the point where they looked like they were presenting a children's TV show. Containing very few memorable songs (if any) and some very shoddy animation, Pete's Dragon is one of Disney's laziest and poorest productions. None of Disney's classic animators (the 'Nine Old Men') worked on the film and it shows. Of what little dragon there is, it appears very little effort or imagination was put into it. Thank the lord then, for Dr. Terminus, played with enjoyable enthusiasm by Jim Dale (who appeared in a few Carry On films) who saves the film from complete embarrassment. He gets the best song 'Passamaquoddy', in which he tries to charm the townsfolk into buying his crap medicine that has already made one of them fat and turned another one of their hair pink, while repeatedly mispronouncing the name of the town. He's like a malpractising Del Boy, and is so enjoyable that I was rooting for him to get his hands on the annoying ginger kid and his crappily animated dragon. Not a total failure then, but instantly forgettable, overlong, excruciatingly squeaky-clean, and exhaustingly enthusiastic. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    I remember at one point in my childhood, I heard about a movie called "Pete's Dragon", maybe when it was about to come on TV, and also remember seeing some of it, though I can't remember how much I saw. There was another part of the film I remember seeing some years later (the part where the Dr. Terminus character manages to win over the initially angry people), but I didn't know what movie I was seeing. After many years, I could still remember the title of this mostly live action Disney film (but one with a cartoon dragon), and finally decided to watch it from start to finish this week. It's far from one of the most highly regarded Disney productions in the long history of the company, and I wasn't expecting it to be among the great ones, but I was expecting it to be better than I found it to be, which is not good at all for the most part. With the help of his magical dragon, Elliott, a young orphaned boy named Pete manages to escape from his cruel adoptive family, the Gogans, but they are still determined to find him somehow or other. The boy and his dragon friend travel together and soon come to a village called Passamaquoddy. Before they enter, Pete tells Elliott that he must make himself invisible (a magical power of his) in order to avoid scaring the people, so the dragon reluctantly does so, but even in his invisible form, he soon causes a lot of trouble in the village, and since nobody can see him, it looks like Pete is responsible! After Pete gets away from an angry mob and Elliott scares Lampie, the drunken lighthouse keeper, the two of them go to a cave near the lighthouse, where Nora, Lampie's daughter, finds Pete and decides to give him shelter in her home. He often talks to her about Elliott, and she doesn't believe that this dragon actually exists, but plays along. Unfortunately, the dragon continues to cause trouble for Pete, and the village of Passamaquoddy has another problem when medicine showman Dr. Terminus and his assistant, Hoagy, are back to swindle the villagers again with their fraudulent formulas! This live action/animation crossover is a musical, and unfortunately, the songs generally don't have much effect. I think this already shows with the first song, sung by the Gogans as they pursue Pete, but it gets worse after the boy and his dragon friend get away from them and we hear the next musical number, "Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too)". During this song, I felt like I was watching something strictly for the very young. Basically, the rest of the songs also fail, including the "I Saw a Dragon" one featured in the part where Lampie tells the people in the tavern what he saw, a notably clumsy segment of the film. The musical numbers are only one of the significant flaws in the film. Most of the cast performances failed to impress me, especially Jane Kean overacting in the role of Miss Taylor, the strict teacher of the village. It doesn't seem that Sean Marshall, who plays the title character, was a very good child actor. "Pete's Dragon" does have some pretty funny parts, but not enough to make it really work as a comedy, either. Also, while I certainly didn't find myself not caring what happened to any of the characters, I still didn't find most of the story too entertaining for some reason, but that might have been largely because of the other problems. This is a mainly live action family musical, and maybe I'm not usually into movies like this, but that hasn't stopped me from finding "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory", a live action family musical from six years before this one, to be a great film, so it's definitely not like "Pete's Dragon" would look bad to me regardless of quality. This particular Disney piece came out the same year as "The Rescuers", an all animated feature which disappointed me when I first saw it last year (I actually found its 1990 sequel, "The Rescuers Down Under", to be much better, as rare as that is with sequels and as much as many Disney fans would probably disagree), but even that film I found to be better than this very lacklustre live action/animation crossover. I gave "Pete's Dragon" a try, and realize that it has a following (not a huge one, but it is a following), but simply put, I just didn't like it. I guess I can still recommend it for kids and won't say adults should avoid it at all costs, but I also still think there are good reasons for all the criticism.

    Endearing animated monster movie about a lively dragon and his little friend . The story takes place in Maine circa 1908 , the starring are an orphaned 9-years-old boy named Pete (Sean Marshall) and his sympathetic dragon Elliot . Freckly Pete flee the overbearing foster Gogan family (Shelley Winters , Charles Tyner), who all utilize him as a slave instead of a kind child. When Pete can successfully escape from them with his protective dragon , his only friend , that only can see , then they stumble into the town of Passamaquaddy- an ocean front dock town plenty of fishermen, drunks and rare people . Pete's arrival does not fit well with the townsfolk , as his pale green dragon Elliott accidentally causes town destruction and rioting among the school teacher , the Mayor (Jim Backus) , the citizens , among others . Expecting to be an outcast yet again, Pete is cared by the loved Nora (Helen Reddy) who lives in a lighthouse with her daddy Lampy (Mickey Rooney ). And when a phony con disguising as a Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale) and his pal (Red Buttons) arrive in the little town , they see Elliott the Dragon as the ultimate profit to his fortune and money. Enjoyable story that mingles animation with live action . This is a likable sort of a kiddies' adaptation of &uml;Harvey&uml; and another attempt for repeat the Mary Poppins magic . The dragon Elliott steals the show , as itself grins, grunts and botchers around.The primitive but efficient animation is by Don Bluth who subsequently would direct successes as Nimh , Anastasia and Titan A.E. .Colorful and evocative cinematography by cameraman Frank Philips . Agreeable choreography and beautiful songs and musical score by Irwin Kostal. The motion picture is professionally directed by Don Chaffey (Jason and the Argonauts, Lassie , million years B.C ).The children will get a kick out of this Disney musical . Rating : Acceptable and passable.
