 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Ted, a stuffy white guy from Illinois working in sales for the Barcelona office of a US corporation, is paid an unexpected visit by his somewhat less stuffy cousin Fred, who is an officer in the US Navy. Over the next few months, both their lives are irrevocably altered by the events which follow Fred's arrival, events which are the trivial stuff of a comedy of manners at first but which gradually grow increasingly dramatic.

    Whit Stillman makes motion pictures like no one else. His vision is unique and incomparable. "Barcelona" is Stillman at his most brilliant, insightful, and uproarious. But, by "uproarious", I should caution: do not expect belly laughs, but subtle winks to a knowing audience. And, further, not snobby, intellectual "in-jokes", either. His humour is very much on the surface -- unless, of course he is talking about "subtext"! -- but not ham-fisted, vulgar, easy jokes either. He speaks through Eigman and Nichols as both his protagonists, antagonists and his chorus. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough; but, it is not for everyone, either. If you find yourself only able to laugh at the blunderbuss humour of Judd Apatow (as movie maker, not television writer, in which he is much more subtle), then avoid Stillman, and all of the "Barcelona Trilogy" -- which consists of "Metropolitan", "Barcelona" and "Last Days of Disco" -- as you will be sorely disappointed. Stillman takes his viewers on an emotional roller-coaster ride, in which you veer from wry comedy into surprisingly compelling and touch drama. It is a thing of masterfully crafted beauty. Stillman gives us the politics of US/NATO intrigue in Spain, the quirky philosophy of sales and love, and a deeply human drama of family and beliefs. It is one of only a dozen or so movie that I have given 10 stars, and it deserves every single one. Enjoy!

    "Barcelona" is a bizarre film that captures your attention through the fast-paced repertoire, but looses you through unfocused political jargon that doesn't seem important, but is obviously an instrumental part of the film. This is where the struggle occurs for this film. It is an internal struggle because of the popularity of "Metropolitan" you want to enjoy this film, feel that brush of fresh air, and laugh at what others would consider "intelligent banter", but even with the subtle humor between Eigeman and Nichols there is something missing that connects the crucial plot elements together. Stillman has created another valuable film, but it feels more like he was trying to reproduce the excitement of "Metropolitan" than create a new voice. One cannot argue that Wit Stillman's style of film-making is still seen throughout modern cinema culture. While watching "Barcelona", there was this eerie feeling of watching "The Darjeeling Limited" again. Stillman's voice can be found in nearly all Wes Anderson films, the witty conversation, the intellectual characters, and the thin layer of plot are Stillman's characteristics seen today. Take "Margo at the Wedding", Baumback uses Stillman with honor and respect, and can even been better seen in Baumback's early "Kicking and Screaming". The key difference between these modern directors and Stillman's "Barcelona" is that they develop both plot and characters. Stillman's visual technique, his ability to capture the sense of normality, and control of the language is powerful in this film, but an apathetic feel for Ted and Fred, coupled with a lack of focus  pushed "Barcelona" from challenging second film to average sophomoric effort. From a sales perspective, Ted and Fred couldn't persuade me to do anything, much less follow them around. Their jovial voice and constant bickering would amuse at first, but like the film became annoying near the end. From a character standpoint, Ted (Taylor Nichols) was enjoyable to watch. He felt like the stuck-in-sales type of guy that others could relate to. Aside from the religious dance scene (continuing with the unfocused plot idea), he was the quintessential hero of this film. Fred (Christopher Eigeman) covers the other end of the spectrum entirely. There was no belief that he was a Navy officer, his constant lying and possible theft (again  that kayaking scene that lead ultimately nowhere) just created an annoying character that tried to be funny, but never was. There was this sense that Eigeman didn't understand he and Nichols' character relationship. One needs to ask, was Nichols' stutter part of the character, or just Stillman's lack of editing? Finally, what was Mira Sorvino doing here? Her accent was thicker than pea soup, yet as unbelievable as pea soup finding its way into a Whit Stillman film. The obscurity of the actors leading us through this political comedy/drama, was a tough nail to bite, but the tougher one was the overall plot of this film. Stillman's goal was to make humor out of an odd anti-American culture in Spain. His actors, as mentioned, tried to bring the humor, but it was up to Stillman to bring us the connectors and overall themes of "Barcelona". It is this area that I felt Stillman was at his weakest. While the actors were not quite the caliber of Stillman's original effort, they at least made me chuckle and think of Wes Anderson's films, but I felt forced and confused by where Stillman was headed with the camera. The bomb at the beginning seemed pass&eacute;, the anti-Americanism comments seemed less real  Stillman never quite secured the feel of realism with this film. Our two characters walk down the street, talk-back to those who oppose them, and show less emotion when the dramatic ending takes place  there just wasn't that sense of fear. This felt insulting. Stillman's eye in this film felt bored, stale, and unenergetic. This needs to be a stand alone film for Stillman, but I found myself comparing it to "Metropolitan" constantly. This film was missing that freshness, or that sense of excitement, and that desire to see the unknown. The relationships were bland, the characters were humorous  but un-follow-able, and the story itself felt forced. This wasn't Stillman's greatest outing. He made some choices that didn't translate well onto the bigger screen. The colors even tired my eyes  it just wasn't the film I expected, or wanted, from Stillman. Overall, "Barcelona" was a second outing for Whit Stillman, but it wasn't the caliber of "Metropolitan". This film felt old, used, and un-welcomed in Stillman's repertoire of characters and language. There was plenty of potential, but it went unused with people like Mira Sorvino attempting to capture the essence of a Spanish woman. Again, I want to state that this film had some very funny moments that were as dry as any martini one could hope for. It had my laughing, but it wasn't enough. I wanted a detailed story, I wanted some of the issues about being a salesman come out clearer, and I wanted that random scene of religion and dancing to carry more gumption. "Barcelona" felt as if Stillman would start ideas, but never quite complete them. This film reminded me of Kevin Smith's early work. Using the same actors, Smith would attempt to recreate the same characters in different environments with mixed results. The power and honesty of Smith's "Clerks" could never be recreated and thus the doomed "Clerks II" will never reach cult status. That analogy could be used for Stillman's "Barcelona". He tried, but there is a reason this film wasn't nominated for the best screenplay category  it just felt elusive and incomplete. Grade: *** (hesitantly) out of *****

    Stillman should make more films definitely. This was a profound film that showed the remarkable decorum that Americans had to face in Barcelona in the mid-80's. Phenomenal acting by Chris and Taylor. I was also blown away by Mira Sorvino's performance - never guessed that she was an American the first time I saw this film. She's that good. Terrific locale - how can anything beat Barcelona? This is a film, like Metropolitan, that you watch over and over and never get tired of it. 30 minutes goes by, an hour, and you're still never bored. You wish the film would go on and on. It's a really shame that talented directors like Stillman can't make movies while the most unbelievably shallow filmmakers continue to bring society down another notch.

    Barecelona is a vastly underrated movie that achieved little success outside of art-house theatres on its release. This is a shame because the movie is both intelligent, funny and has broad appeal. It concerns the adventures of two Americans who find themselves in Barcelona in the early Eighties at the height of the cold war. Ted is an uptight and repressed businessman while Fred is his airforce cousin who's a great deal more relaxed. The film starts with Fred forcing himself on his reluctant cousin's hospitality having just arrived in Barcelona. Yet this isn't a buddy movie. In fact, it's very hard to classify and is by no means typical of an American movie. It's far more European in style. The movie is about clashes of cultures and it's here that the humour is generated. Fred and Ted's differing attitudes and intelligence levels rub up against each other, and the old debate about the differences between male and female outlooks get a look in too. But the largest culture clash is that of urban left-wing Northern Spain versus the naturally conservative and bullish Americanism. This sounds heavy and intellectual but it isn't - the film makes fun of the American culture of living according self-help guides, for example, but also makes fun of a Spanish journalist-cum-philosopher who turns out to be equally shallow. The strongest elements of the movie are the script, which is as tight as any top-notch sitcom, and also the cast. There are some excellent performances all around from some very strong actors. Fans or Mira Sorvino won't get to see a great deal of her, however, as she has a relatively minor supporting role. The film is effectively a celebration of Barcelona and also of the situations that arise when different cultures meet. This might make it hard for some Americans to warm to but, ironically, that merely underlines the movie's main theme - that the world is bigger than the American continent and infinitely wider in its cultural scope.

    "Barcelona", director Whit Stillman's second of three similarly themed feature films, gets a middle-of-the-heap grade from me for being an interesting and surprising idea not entirely well carried out. Landing somewhere between drama and comedy, "Barcelona" is about two American cousins in Barcelona, Spain. Ted is an apparently successful and very keen salesman with an American corporation. Fred, although he is a navy officer, also refers to himself as white-collar; he is something of an office soldier. They both tender relationships with Spanish women, Ted on a short-lived theory of staying clear of beautiful women in favour of plain ones; he goes so far as to tell one of them so. The film is packed with dialogue and, apart from the various situations meant to spark additional chatter, offers only little action-driven plot. Even a dramatic shooting late in the film seems mostly to act as the driving force of dialogue, and of the monologue of the narrator, Ted. Through the dialogue a number of interesting themes are touched upon. Relationships, beauty, sexual revolutions. Politics, prejudice, being an American in a world which is larger than just America. White-collar corporate life, complete with handbooks in economic thinking and salesmanship. The trouble is, these issues are only touched upon and not explored to a degree that seems satisfactory. Too much of the talk, perhaps in an ambition for the film to be funnier than it really is, turns out strange and pointless. Worse, the acting is flawed. Both leads seem strangely uncharismatic to me, unable to make the dialogue come alive at key points, unable to make the attempts at comedy work more than at a few places. The setting of Barcelona helped convince me to watch the film, but while it does have nice pictures here and there, it does not deliver a convincing ambiance of the city or its people. The score is noticeable in the film, but because it is reminiscent of well-known classical works it comes just short of the originality that might have made it great.

    I currently live and work in Barcelona and thought this would be a really interesting movie. Boy, was I wrong! Terrible acting, poor plot, and long. Fortunately, someone gave me the DVD to watch so I did not spend any money! I am appalled that Mira Sorvino would do this movie, but I guess it was before she hit "big time". Hey, in case people do not know--Catalan is spoken in Barcelona more than Spanish (or English). You'd never know it from the movie--everyone speaks English! I am going to watch Gaudi Day next, another movie set in Barcelona. Till then, I am going to pass this one out to my friends who are into the Marquis De Sade!

    I saw this in the theatre when it came out and found it mildly amusing. But watching it at home recently was a dreary bore. To make matters worse, our political climate has rendered it completely obsolete. Much of the dialogue revolves around anti-American sentiment, which has only risen since the film's release. The Spaniards who seemed so harshly critical a decade ago seem to have had their stereotypes about the U.S. government validated. The two main characters who are supposed to be defending the U.S.'s reputation once seemed somewhat witty, now they come across as whiny, self-absorbed fools. "Ted" launches into a monologue in defense of hamburgers--of all things--as if they were what America was all about. Burgers even make an appearance later in the film, reminding us as viewers how superficial these people are. A couple of plot changes propelled the film into an unbelievable direction, and by the time the story wrapped up I had more than had my fill of these characters. The only thing that was of marginal interest was Mira Sorvino before her Oscar win made her well-known. She actually does come across as Spanish. Her character's not very likable either, but at least she's portrayed well. The script is really what's at fault, and having not liked "The Last Days of Disco", I am beginning to wonder if maybe it's not a bad thing writer/director Whit Stillman stopped making films after the 'nineties ended.

    The casting director for this movie should never be allowed to work again. Sadly, the acting in this movie was so pedestrian that it was hard to even care about whatever story there was. Couldn't they find any better actors than this crew? It think they didn't try very hard. Mira Sorvino, probably the only name familiar to most folks, is absolutely awful in this movie. The rest of the not-household names range from barely okay to embarrassing. Really people, if somebody gives you a chunk of money to make a film you care passionately about, hire some good actors. There are plenty of them around, including lots of amazing talents who will work for minimum.

    An American sales representative in Spain (Taylor Nichols) gets a visit from his wacky cousin (U.S. Navy officer Chris Eigeman) and the unlikely duo falls in love with a pair of anti-American Spaniards (Tushka Bergen and the highly erotic Mira Sorvino). Woody Allen-styled script is hilarious with sharp and tight dialog, but the uneven tone starts to wear thin during the film's final act when the production takes a dementedly dramatic turn. None of the performers are really that great (Sorvino is an exception of course), but the screenplay is so smart (most of the time) that you cannot see any other performers in the key roles. Unique film that is worth a look. Not for all audiences, but still a slight success with me. 4 stars out of 5.

    A great joy in a life with film is to discover a film that is competent and coherent, that exists cinematic ally but which on reflection has dynamics worth rejecting. After all, you build your life not so much on absorption but on paring. A great sorrow in film is to encounter a film that isn't quite competent and therefore doesn't project a coherent world. This is the latter. Its mildly interesting in that we can see the writer's sketchbook: he started with three pairs: men and women; two differing and sometimes competing cultures and two "odd couple" cousins. Each of these pairs has some inner dynamics: now triangulate among them all and shake out a story. Spanish passion, falling in love with a dancing woman, a death, another in a coma who recovers. Sounds a lot like "Talk to Her," and in fact you might even find this film interesting if you see it together with Almodovar's gem. But otherwise, all you'll see is a writer's exercise gone awry. There's even a paucity of jokes: only the one about the AFL-CIA. I viewed this only because of the promise of the setting in Barcelona. Like the three dualities of the story, the city is bicameral. It is half African and half European; nominally Spanish, it has its own culture and language half French half Spanish. But its architecture is the thing. There are some Gaudi masterpieces which have influenced a unique approach which is half socialist architecture (yes, there is such a thing) and half wan decorative attempts at Gaudi's space jazz. This all adds to create a special ambiance; one is rarely happy about leaving Barcelona, and I hoped to get some of that environmental joy here. Nope. This could as easily been set in some dreary place like Madrid. Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

Stillman has created another valuable film, but it feels more like he was trying to reproduce the excitement of "Metropolitan" than create a new voice. One cannot argue that Wit Stillman's style of film-making is still seen throughout modern cinema culture. While watching "Barcelona", there was this eerie feeling of watching "The Darjeeling Limited" again. Stillman's voice can be found in nearly all Wes Anderson films, the witty conversation, the intellectual characters, and the thin layer of plot are Stillman's characteristics seen today. Take "Margo at the Wedding", Baumback uses Stillman with honor and respect, and can even been better seen in Baumback's early "Kicking and Screaming". The key difference between these modern directors and Stillman's "Barcelona" is that they develop both plot and characters. Stillman's visual technique, his ability to capture the sense of normality, and control of the language is powerful in this film, but an apathetic feel for Ted and Fred, coupled with a lack of focus  pushed "Barcelona" from challenging second film to average sophomoric effort. From a sales perspective, Ted and Fred couldn't persuade me to do anything, much less follow them around.

It's a really shame that talented directors like Stillman can't make movies while the most unbelievably shallow filmmakers continue to bring society down another notch.

    "Barcelona", director Whit Stillman's second of three similarly themed feature films, gets a middle-of-the-heap grade from me for being an interesting and surprising idea not entirely well carried out. Landing somewhere between drama and comedy, "Barcelona" is about two American cousins in Barcelona, Spain. Ted is an apparently successful and very keen salesman with an American corporation. Fred, although he is a navy officer, also refers to himself as white-collar; he is something of an office soldier. They both tender relationships with Spanish women, Ted on a short-lived theory of staying clear of beautiful women in favour of plain ones; he goes so far as to tell one of them so. The film is packed with dialogue and, apart from the various situations meant to spark additional chatter, offers only little action-driven plot. Even a dramatic shooting late in the film seems mostly to act as the driving force of dialogue, and of the monologue of the narrator, Ted. Through the dialogue a number of interesting themes are touched upon. Relationships, beauty, sexual revolutions. Politics, prejudice, being an American in a world which is larger than just America. White-collar corporate life, complete with handbooks in economic thinking and salesmanship. The trouble is, these issues are only touched upon and not explored to a degree that seems satisfactory. Too much of the talk, perhaps in an ambition for the film to be funnier than it really is, turns out strange and pointless. Worse, the acting is flawed. Both leads seem strangely uncharismatic to me, unable to make the dialogue come alive at key points, unable to make the attempts at comedy work more than at a few places. The setting of Barcelona helped convince me to watch the film, but while it does have nice pictures here and there, it does not deliver a convincing ambiance of the city or its people. The score is noticeable in the film, but because it is reminiscent of well-known classical works it comes just short of the originality that might have made it great.

    I currently live and work in Barcelona and thought this would be a really interesting movie. Boy, was I wrong! Terrible acting, poor plot, and long. Fortunately, someone gave me the DVD to watch so I did not spend any money! I am appalled that Mira Sorvino would do this movie, but I guess it was before she hit "big time". Hey, in case people do not know--Catalan is spoken in Barcelona more than Spanish (or English). You'd never know it from the movie--everyone speaks English! I am going to watch Gaudi Day next, another movie set in Barcelona. Till then, I am going to pass this one out to my friends who are into the Marquis De Sade!

    I saw this in the theatre when it came out and found it mildly amusing. But watching it at home recently was a dreary bore. To make matters worse, our political climate has rendered it completely obsolete. Much of the dialogue revolves around anti-American sentiment, which has only risen since the film's release. The Spaniards who seemed so harshly critical a decade ago seem to have had their stereotypes about the U.S. government validated. The two main characters who are supposed to be defending the U.S.'s reputation once seemed somewhat witty, now they come across as whiny, self-absorbed fools. "Ted" launches into a monologue in defense of hamburgers--of all things--as if they were what America was all about. Burgers even make an appearance later in the film, reminding us as viewers how superficial these people are. A couple of plot changes propelled the film into an unbelievable direction, and by the time the story wrapped up I had more than had my fill of these characters. The only thing that was of marginal interest was Mira Sorvino before her Oscar win made her well-known. She actually does come across as Spanish. Her character's not very likable either, but at least she's portrayed well. The script is really what's at fault, and having not liked "The Last Days of Disco", I am beginning to wonder if maybe it's not a bad thing writer/director Whit Stillman stopped making films after the 'nineties ended.

    The casting director for this movie should never be allowed to work again. Sadly, the acting in this movie was so pedestrian that it was hard to even care about whatever story there was. Couldn't they find any better actors than this crew? It think they didn't try very hard. Mira Sorvino, probably the only name familiar to most folks, is absolutely awful in this movie. The rest of the not-household names range from barely okay to embarrassing. Really people, if somebody gives you a chunk of money to make a film you care passionately about, hire some good actors. There are plenty of them around, including lots of amazing talents who will work for minimum.

    An American sales representative in Spain (Taylor Nichols) gets a visit from his wacky cousin (U.S. Navy officer Chris Eigeman) and the unlikely duo falls in love with a pair of anti-American Spaniards (Tushka Bergen and the highly erotic Mira Sorvino). Woody Allen-styled script is hilarious with sharp and tight dialog, but the uneven tone starts to wear thin during the film's final act when the production takes a dementedly dramatic turn. None of the performers are really that great (Sorvino is an exception of course), but the screenplay is so smart (most of the time) that you cannot see any other performers in the key roles. Unique film that is worth a look. Not for all audiences, but still a slight success with me. 4 stars out of 5.

    A great joy in a life with film is to discover a film that is competent and coherent, that exists cinematic ally but which on reflection has dynamics worth rejecting. After all, you build your life not so much on absorption but on paring. A great sorrow in film is to encounter a film that isn't quite competent and therefore doesn't project a coherent world. This is the latter. Its mildly interesting in that we can see the writer's sketchbook: he started with three pairs: men and women; two differing and sometimes competing cultures and two "odd couple" cousins. Each of these pairs has some inner dynamics: now triangulate among them all and shake out a story. Spanish passion, falling in love with a dancing woman, a death, another in a coma who recovers. Sounds a lot like "Talk to Her," and in fact you might even find this film interesting if you see it together with Almodovar's gem. But otherwise, all you'll see is a writer's exercise gone awry. There's even a paucity of jokes: only the one about the AFL-CIA. I viewed this only because of the promise of the setting in Barcelona. Like the three dualities of the story, the city is bicameral. It is half African and half European; nominally Spanish, it has its own culture and language half French half Spanish. But its architecture is the thing. There are some Gaudi masterpieces which have influenced a unique approach which is half socialist architecture (yes, there is such a thing) and half wan decorative attempts at Gaudi's space jazz. This all adds to create a special ambiance; one is rarely happy about leaving Barcelona, and I hoped to get some of that environmental joy here. Nope. This could as easily been set in some dreary place like Madrid. Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

    Whit Stillman makes motion pictures like no one else. His vision is unique and incomparable. "Barcelona" is Stillman at his most brilliant, insightful, and uproarious. But, by "uproarious", I should caution: do not expect belly laughs, but subtle winks to a knowing audience. And, further, not snobby, intellectual "in-jokes", either. His humour is very much on the surface -- unless, of course he is talking about "subtext"! -- but not ham-fisted, vulgar, easy jokes either. He speaks through Eigman and Nichols as both his protagonists, antagonists and his chorus. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough; but, it is not for everyone, either. If you find yourself only able to laugh at the blunderbuss humour of Judd Apatow (as movie maker, not television writer, in which he is much more subtle), then avoid Stillman, and all of the "Barcelona Trilogy" -- which consists of "Metropolitan", "Barcelona" and "Last Days of Disco" -- as you will be sorely disappointed. Stillman takes his viewers on an emotional roller-coaster ride, in which you veer from wry comedy into surprisingly compelling and touch drama. It is a thing of masterfully crafted beauty. Stillman gives us the politics of US/NATO intrigue in Spain, the quirky philosophy of sales and love, and a deeply human drama of family and beliefs. It is one of only a dozen or so movie that I have given 10 stars, and it deserves every single one. Enjoy!

    "Barcelona" is a bizarre film that captures your attention through the fast-paced repertoire, but looses you through unfocused political jargon that doesn't seem important, but is obviously an instrumental part of the film. This is where the struggle occurs for this film. It is an internal struggle because of the popularity of "Metropolitan" you want to enjoy this film, feel that brush of fresh air, and laugh at what others would consider "intelligent banter", but even with the subtle humor between Eigeman and Nichols there is something missing that connects the crucial plot elements together. Stillman has created another valuable film, but it feels more like he was trying to reproduce the excitement of "Metropolitan" than create a new voice. One cannot argue that Wit Stillman's style of film-making is still seen throughout modern cinema culture. While watching "Barcelona", there was this eerie feeling of watching "The Darjeeling Limited" again. Stillman's voice can be found in nearly all Wes Anderson films, the witty conversation, the intellectual characters, and the thin layer of plot are Stillman's characteristics seen today. Take "Margo at the Wedding", Baumback uses Stillman with honor and respect, and can even been better seen in Baumback's early "Kicking and Screaming". The key difference between these modern directors and Stillman's "Barcelona" is that they develop both plot and characters. Stillman's visual technique, his ability to capture the sense of normality, and control of the language is powerful in this film, but an apathetic feel for Ted and Fred, coupled with a lack of focus  pushed "Barcelona" from challenging second film to average sophomoric effort. From a sales perspective, Ted and Fred couldn't persuade me to do anything, much less follow them around. Their jovial voice and constant bickering would amuse at first, but like the film became annoying near the end. From a character standpoint, Ted (Taylor Nichols) was enjoyable to watch. He felt like the stuck-in-sales type of guy that others could relate to. Aside from the religious dance scene (continuing with the unfocused plot idea), he was the quintessential hero of this film. Fred (Christopher Eigeman) covers the other end of the spectrum entirely. There was no belief that he was a Navy officer, his constant lying and possible theft (again  that kayaking scene that lead ultimately nowhere) just created an annoying character that tried to be funny, but never was. There was this sense that Eigeman didn't understand he and Nichols' character relationship. One needs to ask, was Nichols' stutter part of the character, or just Stillman's lack of editing? Finally, what was Mira Sorvino doing here? Her accent was thicker than pea soup, yet as unbelievable as pea soup finding its way into a Whit Stillman film. The obscurity of the actors leading us through this political comedy/drama, was a tough nail to bite, but the tougher one was the overall plot of this film. Stillman's goal was to make humor out of an odd anti-American culture in Spain. His actors, as mentioned, tried to bring the humor, but it was up to Stillman to bring us the connectors and overall themes of "Barcelona". It is this area that I felt Stillman was at his weakest. While the actors were not quite the caliber of Stillman's original effort, they at least made me chuckle and think of Wes Anderson's films, but I felt forced and confused by where Stillman was headed with the camera. The bomb at the beginning seemed pass&eacute;, the anti-Americanism comments seemed less real  Stillman never quite secured the feel of realism with this film. Our two characters walk down the street, talk-back to those who oppose them, and show less emotion when the dramatic ending takes place  there just wasn't that sense of fear. This felt insulting. Stillman's eye in this film felt bored, stale, and unenergetic. This needs to be a stand alone film for Stillman, but I found myself comparing it to "Metropolitan" constantly. This film was missing that freshness, or that sense of excitement, and that desire to see the unknown. The relationships were bland, the characters were humorous  but un-follow-able, and the story itself felt forced. This wasn't Stillman's greatest outing. He made some choices that didn't translate well onto the bigger screen. The colors even tired my eyes  it just wasn't the film I expected, or wanted, from Stillman. Overall, "Barcelona" was a second outing for Whit Stillman, but it wasn't the caliber of "Metropolitan". This film felt old, used, and un-welcomed in Stillman's repertoire of characters and language. There was plenty of potential, but it went unused with people like Mira Sorvino attempting to capture the essence of a Spanish woman. Again, I want to state that this film had some very funny moments that were as dry as any martini one could hope for. It had my laughing, but it wasn't enough. I wanted a detailed story, I wanted some of the issues about being a salesman come out clearer, and I wanted that random scene of religion and dancing to carry more gumption. "Barcelona" felt as if Stillman would start ideas, but never quite complete them. This film reminded me of Kevin Smith's early work. Using the same actors, Smith would attempt to recreate the same characters in different environments with mixed results. The power and honesty of Smith's "Clerks" could never be recreated and thus the doomed "Clerks II" will never reach cult status. That analogy could be used for Stillman's "Barcelona". He tried, but there is a reason this film wasn't nominated for the best screenplay category  it just felt elusive and incomplete. Grade: *** (hesitantly) out of *****

    Stillman should make more films definitely. This was a profound film that showed the remarkable decorum that Americans had to face in Barcelona in the mid-80's. Phenomenal acting by Chris and Taylor. I was also blown away by Mira Sorvino's performance - never guessed that she was an American the first time I saw this film. She's that good. Terrific locale - how can anything beat Barcelona? This is a film, like Metropolitan, that you watch over and over and never get tired of it. 30 minutes goes by, an hour, and you're still never bored. You wish the film would go on and on. It's a really shame that talented directors like Stillman can't make movies while the most unbelievably shallow filmmakers continue to bring society down another notch.

    Barecelona is a vastly underrated movie that achieved little success outside of art-house theatres on its release. This is a shame because the movie is both intelligent, funny and has broad appeal. It concerns the adventures of two Americans who find themselves in Barcelona in the early Eighties at the height of the cold war. Ted is an uptight and repressed businessman while Fred is his airforce cousin who's a great deal more relaxed. The film starts with Fred forcing himself on his reluctant cousin's hospitality having just arrived in Barcelona. Yet this isn't a buddy movie. In fact, it's very hard to classify and is by no means typical of an American movie. It's far more European in style. The movie is about clashes of cultures and it's here that the humour is generated. Fred and Ted's differing attitudes and intelligence levels rub up against each other, and the old debate about the differences between male and female outlooks get a look in too. But the largest culture clash is that of urban left-wing Northern Spain versus the naturally conservative and bullish Americanism. This sounds heavy and intellectual but it isn't - the film makes fun of the American culture of living according self-help guides, for example, but also makes fun of a Spanish journalist-cum-philosopher who turns out to be equally shallow. The strongest elements of the movie are the script, which is as tight as any top-notch sitcom, and also the cast. There are some excellent performances all around from some very strong actors. Fans or Mira Sorvino won't get to see a great deal of her, however, as she has a relatively minor supporting role. The film is effectively a celebration of Barcelona and also of the situations that arise when different cultures meet. This might make it hard for some Americans to warm to but, ironically, that merely underlines the movie's main theme - that the world is bigger than the American continent and infinitely wider in its cultural scope.

    "Barcelona", director Whit Stillman's second of three similarly themed feature films, gets a middle-of-the-heap grade from me for being an interesting and surprising idea not entirely well carried out. Landing somewhere between drama and comedy, "Barcelona" is about two American cousins in Barcelona, Spain. Ted is an apparently successful and very keen salesman with an American corporation. Fred, although he is a navy officer, also refers to himself as white-collar; he is something of an office soldier. They both tender relationships with Spanish women, Ted on a short-lived theory of staying clear of beautiful women in favour of plain ones; he goes so far as to tell one of them so. The film is packed with dialogue and, apart from the various situations meant to spark additional chatter, offers only little action-driven plot. Even a dramatic shooting late in the film seems mostly to act as the driving force of dialogue, and of the monologue of the narrator, Ted. Through the dialogue a number of interesting themes are touched upon. Relationships, beauty, sexual revolutions. Politics, prejudice, being an American in a world which is larger than just America. White-collar corporate life, complete with handbooks in economic thinking and salesmanship. The trouble is, these issues are only touched upon and not explored to a degree that seems satisfactory. Too much of the talk, perhaps in an ambition for the film to be funnier than it really is, turns out strange and pointless. Worse, the acting is flawed. Both leads seem strangely uncharismatic to me, unable to make the dialogue come alive at key points, unable to make the attempts at comedy work more than at a few places. The setting of Barcelona helped convince me to watch the film, but while it does have nice pictures here and there, it does not deliver a convincing ambiance of the city or its people. The score is noticeable in the film, but because it is reminiscent of well-known classical works it comes just short of the originality that might have made it great.

Stillman takes his viewers on an emotional roller-coaster ride, in which you veer from wry comedy into surprisingly compelling and touch drama. It is a thing of masterfully crafted beauty. Stillman gives us the politics of US/NATO intrigue in Spain, the quirky philosophy of sales and love, and a deeply human drama of family and beliefs. It is one of only a dozen or so movie that I have given 10 stars, and it deserves every single one. Enjoy!

One cannot argue that Wit Stillman's style of film-making is still seen throughout modern cinema culture. While watching "Barcelona", there was this eerie feeling of watching "The Darjeeling Limited" again. Stillman's voice can be found in nearly all Wes Anderson films, the witty conversation, the intellectual characters, and the thin layer of plot are Stillman's characteristics seen today. Take "Margo at the Wedding", Baumback uses Stillman with honor and respect, and can even been better seen in Baumback's early "Kicking and Screaming". The key difference between these modern directors and Stillman's "Barcelona" is that they develop both plot and characters. Stillman's visual technique, his ability to capture the sense of normality, and control of the language is powerful in this film, but an apathetic feel for Ted and Fred, coupled with a lack of focus  pushed "Barcelona" from challenging second film to average sophomoric effort. From a sales perspective, Ted and Fred couldn't persuade me to do anything, much less follow them around. Their jovial voice and constant bickering would amuse at first, but like the film became annoying near the end. From a character standpoint, Ted (Taylor Nichols) was enjoyable to watch. He felt like the stuck-in-sales type of guy that others could relate to. Aside from the religious dance scene (continuing with the unfocused plot idea), he was the quintessential hero of this film. Fred (Christopher Eigeman) covers the other end of the spectrum entirely. There was no belief that he was a Navy officer, his constant lying and possible theft (again  that kayaking scene that lead ultimately nowhere) just created an annoying character that tried to be funny, but never was. There was this sense that Eigeman didn't understand he and Nichols' character relationship. One needs to ask, was Nichols' stutter part of the character, or just Stillman's lack of editing? Finally, what was Mira Sorvino doing here? Her accent was thicker than pea soup, yet as unbelievable as pea soup finding its way into a Whit Stillman film. The obscurity of the actors leading us through this political comedy/drama, was a tough nail to bite, but the tougher one was the overall plot of this film. Stillman's goal was to make humor out of an odd anti-American culture in Spain. His actors, as mentioned, tried to bring the humor, but it was up to Stillman to bring us the connectors and overall themes of "Barcelona". It is this area that I felt Stillman was at his weakest. While the actors were not quite the caliber of Stillman's original effort, they at least made me chuckle and think of Wes Anderson's films, but I felt forced and confused by where Stillman was headed with the camera. The bomb at the beginning seemed pass&eacute;, the anti-Americanism comments seemed less real  Stillman never quite secured the feel of realism with this film. Our two characters walk down the street, talk-back to those who oppose them, and show less emotion when the dramatic ending takes place  there just wasn't that sense of fear. This felt insulting. Stillman's eye in this film felt bored, stale, and unenergetic. This needs to be a stand alone film for Stillman, but I found myself comparing it to "Metropolitan" constantly. This film was missing that freshness, or that sense of excitement, and that desire to see the unknown. The relationships were bland, the characters were humorous  but un-follow-able, and the story itself felt forced. This wasn't Stillman's greatest outing. He made some choices that didn't translate well onto the bigger screen. The colors even tired my eyes  it just wasn't the film I expected, or wanted, from Stillman. Overall, "Barcelona" was a second outing for Whit Stillman, but it wasn't the caliber of "Metropolitan". This film felt old, used, and un-welcomed in Stillman's repertoire of characters and language. There was plenty of potential, but it went unused with people like Mira Sorvino attempting to capture the essence of a Spanish woman. Again, I want to state that this film had some very funny moments that were as dry as any martini one could hope for. It had my laughing, but it wasn't enough. I wanted a detailed story, I wanted some of the issues about being a salesman come out clearer, and I wanted that random scene of religion and dancing to carry more gumption. "Barcelona" felt as if Stillman would start ideas, but never quite complete them. This film reminded me of Kevin Smith's early work. Using the same actors, Smith would attempt to recreate the same characters in different environments with mixed results. The power and honesty of Smith's "Clerks" could never be recreated and thus the doomed "Clerks II" will never reach cult status. That analogy could be used for Stillman's "Barcelona". He tried, but there is a reason this film wasn't nominated for the best screenplay category  it just felt elusive and incomplete. Grade: *** (hesitantly) out of *****

    Stillman should make more films definitely. This was a profound film that showed the remarkable decorum that Americans had to face in Barcelona in the mid-80's. Phenomenal acting by Chris and Taylor. I was also blown away by Mira Sorvino's performance - never guessed that she was an American the first time I saw this film. She's that good. Terrific locale - how can anything beat Barcelona? This is a film, like Metropolitan, that you watch over and over and never get tired of it. 30 minutes goes by, an hour, and you're still never bored. You wish the film would go on and on. It's a really shame that talented directors like Stillman can't make movies while the most unbelievably shallow filmmakers continue to bring society down another notch.

    Barecelona is a vastly underrated movie that achieved little success outside of art-house theatres on its release. This is a shame because the movie is both intelligent, funny and has broad appeal. It concerns the adventures of two Americans who find themselves in Barcelona in the early Eighties at the height of the cold war. Ted is an uptight and repressed businessman while Fred is his airforce cousin who's a great deal more relaxed. The film starts with Fred forcing himself on his reluctant cousin's hospitality having just arrived in Barcelona. Yet this isn't a buddy movie. In fact, it's very hard to classify and is by no means typical of an American movie. It's far more European in style. The movie is about clashes of cultures and it's here that the humour is generated. Fred and Ted's differing attitudes and intelligence levels rub up against each other, and the old debate about the differences between male and female outlooks get a look in too. But the largest culture clash is that of urban left-wing Northern Spain versus the naturally conservative and bullish Americanism. This sounds heavy and intellectual but it isn't - the film makes fun of the American culture of living according self-help guides, for example, but also makes fun of a Spanish journalist-cum-philosopher who turns out to be equally shallow. The strongest elements of the movie are the script, which is as tight as any top-notch sitcom, and also the cast. There are some excellent performances all around from some very strong actors. Fans or Mira Sorvino won't get to see a great deal of her, however, as she has a relatively minor supporting role. The film is effectively a celebration of Barcelona and also of the situations that arise when different cultures meet. This might make it hard for some Americans to warm to but, ironically, that merely underlines the movie's main theme - that the world is bigger than the American continent and infinitely wider in its cultural scope.

    "Barcelona", director Whit Stillman's second of three similarly themed feature films, gets a middle-of-the-heap grade from me for being an interesting and surprising idea not entirely well carried out. Landing somewhere between drama and comedy, "Barcelona" is about two American cousins in Barcelona, Spain. Ted is an apparently successful and very keen salesman with an American corporation. Fred, although he is a navy officer, also refers to himself as white-collar; he is something of an office soldier. They both tender relationships with Spanish women, Ted on a short-lived theory of staying clear of beautiful women in favour of plain ones; he goes so far as to tell one of them so. The film is packed with dialogue and, apart from the various situations meant to spark additional chatter, offers only little action-driven plot. Even a dramatic shooting late in the film seems mostly to act as the driving force of dialogue, and of the monologue of the narrator, Ted. Through the dialogue a number of interesting themes are touched upon. Relationships, beauty, sexual revolutions. Politics, prejudice, being an American in a world which is larger than just America. White-collar corporate life, complete with handbooks in economic thinking and salesmanship. The trouble is, these issues are only touched upon and not explored to a degree that seems satisfactory. Too much of the talk, perhaps in an ambition for the film to be funnier than it really is, turns out strange and pointless. Worse, the acting is flawed. Both leads seem strangely uncharismatic to me, unable to make the dialogue come alive at key points, unable to make the attempts at comedy work more than at a few places. The setting of Barcelona helped convince me to watch the film, but while it does have nice pictures here and there, it does not deliver a convincing ambiance of the city or its people. The score is noticeable in the film, but because it is reminiscent of well-known classical works it comes just short of the originality that might have made it great.

    I currently live and work in Barcelona and thought this would be a really interesting movie. Boy, was I wrong! Terrible acting, poor plot, and long. Fortunately, someone gave me the DVD to watch so I did not spend any money! I am appalled that Mira Sorvino would do this movie, but I guess it was before she hit "big time". Hey, in case people do not know--Catalan is spoken in Barcelona more than Spanish (or English). You'd never know it from the movie--everyone speaks English! I am going to watch Gaudi Day next, another movie set in Barcelona. Till then, I am going to pass this one out to my friends who are into the Marquis De Sade!

    I saw this in the theatre when it came out and found it mildly amusing. But watching it at home recently was a dreary bore. To make matters worse, our political climate has rendered it completely obsolete. Much of the dialogue revolves around anti-American sentiment, which has only risen since the film's release. The Spaniards who seemed so harshly critical a decade ago seem to have had their stereotypes about the U.S. government validated. The two main characters who are supposed to be defending the U.S.'s reputation once seemed somewhat witty, now they come across as whiny, self-absorbed fools. "Ted" launches into a monologue in defense of hamburgers--of all things--as if they were what America was all about. Burgers even make an appearance later in the film, reminding us as viewers how superficial these people are. A couple of plot changes propelled the film into an unbelievable direction, and by the time the story wrapped up I had more than had my fill of these characters. The only thing that was of marginal interest was Mira Sorvino before her Oscar win made her well-known. She actually does come across as Spanish. Her character's not very likable either, but at least she's portrayed well. The script is really what's at fault, and having not liked "The Last Days of Disco", I am beginning to wonder if maybe it's not a bad thing writer/director Whit Stillman stopped making films after the 'nineties ended.

    The casting director for this movie should never be allowed to work again. Sadly, the acting in this movie was so pedestrian that it was hard to even care about whatever story there was. Couldn't they find any better actors than this crew? It think they didn't try very hard. Mira Sorvino, probably the only name familiar to most folks, is absolutely awful in this movie. The rest of the not-household names range from barely okay to embarrassing. Really people, if somebody gives you a chunk of money to make a film you care passionately about, hire some good actors. There are plenty of them around, including lots of amazing talents who will work for minimum.

    An American sales representative in Spain (Taylor Nichols) gets a visit from his wacky cousin (U.S. Navy officer Chris Eigeman) and the unlikely duo falls in love with a pair of anti-American Spaniards (Tushka Bergen and the highly erotic Mira Sorvino). Woody Allen-styled script is hilarious with sharp and tight dialog, but the uneven tone starts to wear thin during the film's final act when the production takes a dementedly dramatic turn. None of the performers are really that great (Sorvino is an exception of course), but the screenplay is so smart (most of the time) that you cannot see any other performers in the key roles. Unique film that is worth a look. Not for all audiences, but still a slight success with me. 4 stars out of 5.

    A great joy in a life with film is to discover a film that is competent and coherent, that exists cinematic ally but which on reflection has dynamics worth rejecting. After all, you build your life not so much on absorption but on paring. A great sorrow in film is to encounter a film that isn't quite competent and therefore doesn't project a coherent world. This is the latter. Its mildly interesting in that we can see the writer's sketchbook: he started with three pairs: men and women; two differing and sometimes competing cultures and two "odd couple" cousins. Each of these pairs has some inner dynamics: now triangulate among them all and shake out a story. Spanish passion, falling in love with a dancing woman, a death, another in a coma who recovers. Sounds a lot like "Talk to Her," and in fact you might even find this film interesting if you see it together with Almodovar's gem. But otherwise, all you'll see is a writer's exercise gone awry. There's even a paucity of jokes: only the one about the AFL-CIA. I viewed this only because of the promise of the setting in Barcelona. Like the three dualities of the story, the city is bicameral. It is half African and half European; nominally Spanish, it has its own culture and language half French half Spanish. But its architecture is the thing. There are some Gaudi masterpieces which have influenced a unique approach which is half socialist architecture (yes, there is such a thing) and half wan decorative attempts at Gaudi's space jazz. This all adds to create a special ambiance; one is rarely happy about leaving Barcelona, and I hoped to get some of that environmental joy here. Nope. This could as easily been set in some dreary place like Madrid. Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.
