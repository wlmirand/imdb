 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  "A Modern Affair" is a romantic comedy about the strain of contemporary relationships, one woman's urgent desire for parenthood, and a solution to it all. Grace Rhodes is the perfect corporate executive -- bright, successful, attractive and with just professional touch. With her career in place, Grace feels she has everything she needs -- until she bumps into an ex-boyfriend bearing photos of his young kids. Feeling the irresistible urge to have a child, but not sure about waiting around for Mr. Right," Grace knows what she wants, but not how best to get it. Elaine, her wryly pragmatic best friend, suggests that Grace do the unthinkable and enlist the services of a sperm bank. After choosing a donor from the "DNA menu," Grace becomes pregnant and deeply curious about the identity of the donor #247. Enter Peter Kessler, a handsome photographer who divides his time between his craft, his casual affair with a married woman, and his "other job:" depositing specimens as a sperm donor to ...

    A Modern Affair sets up an interesting premise for a romantic comedy. While it follows the standard beats of a RomCom, it's still an entertaining film. It works because the comedy is funny, but not overbearing, the characters seem like real people, and the dialogue is consistently realistic. At times the dialogue is absolutely spot on. The realism in the characters allows for a good look into relationships and (new) parenting. There is also a subplot of city living versus country living. While interesting, I think this could have been expanded even more. Grace and Peter are two different people in very different settings, yet we only get a little bit of the conflict between the places they live. Solid film that is worth the watch.

    I came across this film earlier in the year. I was looking to see what Ms. Eichhorn had acted in that I had not seen and there it was. She always appears to have a way to connect with her audience. He approach always appears realistic and on target, for me, anyway. I would suggest this film for anyone who enjoys a quality performance from a truly talented artist. I have always admired Ms. Eichhorn since the first time I viewed YANKS. I could never understand what it was about that film that never "took off." Modern Affair is an equally, genuine performance. It captures humor, realism, and thought so often missing in todays fims.

    I found this simply by surfing through the IMDb randomly one day from Stanley Tucci's page and thought it looked interesting, so I watched it. I was so surprised to find such a gem of a film tucked away! He has always been one of my favorites. Tucci is, of course, great in this film and makes it worth watching on its own--but there are so many funny, cute moments in it that it really is a great film. I loved the whole scene in the gallery- the writing was spot on and really did make me laugh. I can see myself re-watching it if I'm looking for a feel- good pick me up sometime. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for some good, solid entertainment.

    Though at first it might seem like a chick flick from the trailer and summary, this film is much more complex and appeals to a much larger audience than just women. Grace is a woman of the 90s, a working woman who can carry her own. She wants a child, but is not getting any younger while looking for Mr. Right and decides to take matters into her own hands. Very entertaining. Stanley Tucci delivers and excellent performance (as usual) in the film, helping create a dynamic character for Lisa Eichhorn to play off of. I really liked this film because it wasn't just a love story between two people. It took a different approach and was certainly unique, tackling issues that were and still are very important in society.

    This first time I watched this film, I really didn't get it. I figured, that this was a film for an older crowd, and being a teenager meant I just wasn't going to understand it. But I watched it again a few months later, and I think it's just one of those films you have to watch twice to REALLY understand. A lot of the deep conversations that the two lead characters have in this film kind of went over my head the first time, but when watching it again, I really see what it is that they are saying. It's about the struggle to find love later in life, whether it comes from a partner, from your work, or from forming a family. This was a really great film.

    This film came recommended to me by one of my co-workers and I decided, why not, let's check it out. I didn't really know anything about it, except for the synopsis given on Netflix. Anyway, I rented it and forced my husband to watch it with me a weeks ago. About ten minutes in, I thought "oh god, my husband is going to kill me for making him watch a chick flick." Surprisingly enough, this film turned out to be the exact opposite of that. This isn't a chick flick at all. It's insightful, thoughtful, and appeals to both women AND men. As it turns out, my husband absolutely loved this movie. While this movie is primarily about relationships, it provides both the viewpoints of the man and the woman in the relationship. I really appreciate that sort of thing.

    I think this is Stanley Tucci's first big film role, and you can really tell why his career took off after this. While his character (Peter) may not always be very likable at times in the film, he is a really dynamic character. The big scene where he fights with Lisa Eichhorn's character is absolutely heart- breaking and so powerful. I can't believe that he didn't win any Oscar for this role. I love watching him in this film. Lisa Eichhorn also plays an incredible role in this. She reminds me a bit of Meg Ryan and Meryl Streep. It's a great performance. I recommend this movie for anyone who loves film!

    While this is mostly categorized as a "romantic comedy," I think this film is actually a great drama. It's so touching and heart-wrenching. Lisa Eichhorn's character (Grace) is a strong, career-driven woman who wants to have a child but has a problem relating with men. Instead of trying to meet a man in the conventional way, she takes herself to a sperm-donor bank. However, she gets nervous about the outcome of her procedure, and decides that she wants to meet the owner of the specimen she purchased. After a bit of detective work, she discovers Peter (played by Stanley Tucci) as the father of her unborn child. The romance that unfolds between the two of the is wonderful to watchit's exciting! I love this movie!

    I just watched "A Modern Affair" on Hulu, where they have the entire film online. I was absolutely blown away by Lisa Eichhorn's performance. She's realistic, relatable, and smart. As a successful career woman, Grace hasn't got time for men, nor does she feel like she can ever connect with one. Her best friend is constantly encouraging her to strike up a relationship, but Grace finds it too difficult. However, lacking any real meaning in her personal life, she does decide that she is determined to start a family. Her journey looking for love and happiness isn't a fairytale like you'd find in some movies, but it's like real life, which is probably why I like this movie so much. It's not an escapist film, it's something real women (and men) can identify with.

    I actually found this film when it was featured as Fancast.com's "Movie of the Week" this past week. I was able to watch it in its entirely online, and I only wish I'd been able to see it when it was on the big screen. "A Modern Affair" stars Lisa Eichhorn as a Grace, a corporate executive with the perfect life until she begins to experience an urgent desire for parenthood. Her quest for the perfect sperm donor and desire to control every aspect of the process lead her to surreptitiously pursue the donor, a handsome photographer (Stanley Tucci in his first starring role). When the two actually meet, a relationship begins to develop, and Grace has to decide whether or not to tell him the truth. This movie really pulls at your heart, but still makes you laugh. A definite choice for anyone looking for a good flick on a Saturday night.
