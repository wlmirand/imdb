 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Benny, a hapless grifter, is thrown off a train after cheating at cards, and into the life of Tanya, a lovely bartender. Tanya has been supporting her husband, a former ballplayer, since his accident, waiting for an insurance settlement that will solve all their financial woes. But when it comes, he refuses to share it with her, claiming with newfound piety that money is the root of all evil. She then enlists the help of Benny to concoct a scheme to get her fair share of the settlement, and he finds one: a local Catholic mission needs money for repairs and Benny decides to create a miracle that will encourage husband Henry to fork over the money - which Benny and Tanya will intercept and share.

    I discovered this film in a small theatre in Boston when I was travelling around the USA after doing summer camp. It never had a release here in the UK and I had to wait years for it to appear on DVD. Strangely the brilliant soundtrack (by the Iguanas) turned up in a small movie store in northern England a few years later. I have great memories of watching Lara Flynn Boyle in the film, I remember I watched the Frighteners and spotted Peter Dobson. Was also great to see the lovely Danny Nucci in Titanic a few years later. Isn't it great when you discover a little gem and you enjoy telling your friends about it. Thanks to ebay I now own a copy of this great movie, and no-one I have shared it with has been disappointed.

    I think I recall seeing Danny Nucci in the kid's show "Hey Dude" years ago, and he sure has grown up! He's hot! He is what made watching this movie worthwhile........ The premise of the movie is pretty lame and unbelievable, but Lara Flynn Boyle was lovely (this was before she lost so much weight). This must have been an early movie for Peter Dobson as well, I believe I've seen him in some other things since then. Luca Bercovici as Henry Mulhill was a wholly unlikeable character so you don't feel too bad for what goes on with him. Teresa DiSpina as Cece was a salty/sassy pleasure to watch. I would have liked to have her with more dialog in the movie. Again, unless you want to see Danni Nucci as a romantic lead (as I did), I would totally pass on this movie.

    I came across this film on the Lifetime network. I decided to watch the film after realizing that Lara Flynn Boyle was the star. Her presence did improve the films palatability but, not enough to make my viewing experience pleasant. The reason for my dissatisfaction is the combination of bad or miscast acting, a lifeless script, and multidirectional film making. One half of the film almost has the feeling of an afterschool special and the other half attempts to be a gritty suspense piece with corn ball characters. This is the only movie that I have ever witnessed where church scenes are more exciting then the bar footage. My recommendation is to avoid this body of rubbish.
