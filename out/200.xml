    A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father (Jack Nicholson) into violence, while his psychic son (Danny Lloyd) sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future. What is most interesting is that this film has gone from bad to good. When it first came out, the reviews were not so positive, and there were even some Golden Raspberry nominations (but no wins). Today, this is not only considered a top horror film but one of the top 100 films of any genre... what a turnaround. Then we have King's disappointment, and I think he raises serious concerns: he did not like the casting of Nicholson, and he did not think Kubrick made the film as horror-focused as it could have been. On the first point, it is true that the lead should have had a greater transition. Nicholson just looks crazy from the first scene. I would love to have seen Michael Moriarty... As for the Kubrick criticism, it is true... he bent over backwards to make an artsy, stylish film, but maybe not a horror film. It is a great film, but maybe not a great horror film. If you want a good haunting film, for example, "The Changeling" has this one beat...

    Every time one of the best horror of it is that, like a lot of excellent work, based on the Stephen King short story. Jack Nicholson brings his best work by far, is probably the "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a" game film is superior to c. Child actor in the film provides a remarkably good shaping, in which an actor with a similar age not exactly common. Kubrick and the film itself also received a lot of criticism, due to the fact that the film differs significantly from the Mutola used many times and it is unreasonable. But if you know Kubrick's work, you know that it is no coincidence here. Everything that is important, every last detail of a metaphor. And if Kubrick had proved himself exceptionally in the horror genre, I have to say that this is going to him. The film is an indescribable, claustrophobic feel to it, which did the trick: awesome!

    The Shining The best thing about an empty resort is you can combine the tiny shampoo into one normal sized bottle. However, personal hygiene isn't on the mind of the crazed writer in this psychological thriller. Hired to maintain the Overlook Hotel during the winter, Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) moves his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and his mentally gifted son Danny (Danny Lloyd) into the servants' quarters. While he tries to write, Wendy runs maintenance checks, and Danny rides his big wheel past ghostly twin sisters, a hemorrhaging elevator, and the forbidding room 237. Downstairs, Danny's dad - spurned on by an evil bartender - decides to murder his family with an axe. Based on Stephen King's book, director Stanley Kubrik transforms the novel's intuitive narrative into a subversive and superbly shot shocker. Malicious ghosts aside, what would drive most people crazy, would be abstaining from the mini bar for 5 months. Green Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.com

    This is probably the most overrated movie of all times. I'm not a huge horror fan and I get scared very easily, but this movie actually made me laugh or sigh in despair about the lengthiness of the scenes and the predictability of the plot. I read the novel when I was a teen and it beat the crap out of me, I still am afraid of bath tubs in hotel rooms (embarrassing but true). The novel is an all time favourite of me and when I read all the great reviews about Kubick's Shining I was really looking forward to see the movie. What a mistake. For all lovers of the book, this is not a book adaptation, Kubick made his own story...unfortunately. Not only does Dick Hallorann get murdered by Jack - the fact he survives in the novel was one of the reasons I loved the book so much, it has after all somewhat of a happy ending -, but even worse, Kubick turned the whole story around and twisted it to an extend where the original plot is hard to recognize. Jack Torrance is very obviously a mad man right from the beginning who very openly hates his wife and kid, so as others have pointed out before, why didn't he leave his family or killed them before. The whole point of the novel, the normal guy and loving father with a hang to alcohol who gradually gets brainwashed by appearances in the hotel, gets totally lost. One might wonder why the movie even needs the whole hotel plot if Torrance is already mad as a hatter from the very beginning. Apart from this, I guess, had I not read the novel I would probably not understand one bit of what was going on with the characters. But unfortunately that's not all. Also the performances of Nicholson and Duvall were so lousy, it really crept me out. I've never seen Jack Nicholson perform so badly, he seemed like a parody of himself and don't get me started on Shelley Duvall. Periodically I thought I watched some amateur actor in a school play. Her adaptation of Wendy Torrance was so annoying I was staggered between the wish of seeing her chopped to pieces and the wish to see her survive and protect her little boy. The character Wendy in the novel is a strong, resourceful person, the Wendy in the movie is a whiny, weak, and extremely stupid person. The fact that she lays down and sleeps while she is trapped with her 'sick' son and a mad man in a hotel with no contact to the outside world is beneath me. The ending is probably the worst part of the entire movie, on the one hand it's ecstasy as the film draws to an end on the other hand it is as far from the original plot as can be which in this case is an extremely bad thing. The only actor that impressed me was Danny Lloyd, apart from the fact that Kubick partly tried to turn him into a parody of Regan MacNeil I think he did a fantastic job for the little six year old boy he was to that time. He seemed like the only natural actor on the scene. All in all this movie was by far the biggest disappointment I've seen for a long time. Save your time, better read the book.

    I was told that this is a great movie, but after I watched it, it didn't seem to be so good. However, I found out that it's the starting of such a kind of horror film that presents in a closed set and it was even shot at 80's, I realized how incredible it is. The main characters seems to be a little affected considering in today's ways. The black man seems to be a significant character, but he dies so suddenly and it's really makes me confessed. It was created from a novel, but seems to be with some modifications which gives the movie another meaning about Indian Americans as far as I understand. But still, first impression is hard to change~

    Stanley Kubrick directed this (loose) adaptation of Stephen King's superb novel, about married couple Jack & Wendy Torrance(Jack Nicholson & Shelley Duvall) and their young son Danny who go to an isolated Colorado hotel as caretakers for the winter, when the hotel is forced to close. They are met by the head chef Dick Halloran(Scatman Crothers) who recognizes in Danny what he knows about himself: that they have powerful psychic abilities called "Shining" that alerts them to ghostly presences. Unfortunately for them, the hotel, called the Overlook, is indeed haunted with evil and violent ghosts that are determined to destroy them, and then add their spirits to those already there... Genuinely terrifying film is supremely well crafted and directed by Stanley Kubrick, made more frightening by the sinister banshee wailing music score that really gets under the viewer's hide. Fine performances by all, claustrophobic atmosphere and horrifying imagery in this top-class adaptation; though writer Stephen King disliked the changes made to his novel(author's privilege) this film is nonetheless among the top horror pictures ever made. Once seen, not easily forgotten...

    This is an amazing classic thriller that you could watch time and again. This film is filled with beautiful yet horrifying imagery that you remember well after the film has finished. The film is layered with mysterious occurrences that I sometimes after watching multiple times begin to take on new meaning. The entire thing is brilliantly constructed and amazingly imaginative. It's like your worst nightmare come true. The child was brilliantly casted. To me, he's the creepiest of them all. I especially enjoyed the set design and special effects. Everyone should see this film at least once. It is one of my favorites. And I have not read the book so cannot comment on how the film compares.

    I've been meaning to revisit The Shining for the last couple of months and I'm glad I finally did it. Stanley Kubrick succeeded in creating a brilliant psychological horror film with memorable characters and a lot of surreal and fantastical elements. You really need to watch it at least twice in order to understand all the subtle and disturbing allusions. Also, there are many breathtaking landscapes and I am always amazed by Kubrick's exquisite camera work. The first shot showing the river mirroring the mountains and trees or the one where we follow Danny playing in the hotel corridors, not knowing what he will find next are a few examples of the master in action. Now let's talk about the acting. Jack Nicholson delivers a terrific performance as Jack Torrance, making you really believe how insane and tormented his character gradually becomes throughout the film. Shelley Duvall is excellent as Wendy, this very innocent and quirky wife, who will do anything to protect her child. Finally, Danny Lloyd portrays Jack and Wendy's son who has a very peculiar ability and he provides a convincing and solid performance as well. The Shining is chilling, unforgettable and manages to shock you until the end, with a striking final shot. It's certainly one of the finest horror films ever made!

    The Shining is one of the most chilling and memorable horror movies of all time. The film follows a writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) and his family who are offered a job as winter caretakers for the Overlook Hotel. Despite the dark rumours about the hotel Jack accepts as he believes the quiet will help him overcome his writer's block. Little does he know that the hotel will bring out a lot more than the artistic side of him. Kubrick gives us the eerie, elegant and wonderfully lit spaces of the Overlook Hotel. You sense this isolated and mysterious place the Torrances now call a home isn't quite right, the place is filled with memories of it's violent past and the true horror and suffering that has taken place here is soon revealed. Kubrick tries to simultaneously unfold two stories, one being the hidden secrets the Outlook Hotel possesses and another being a family drama. It has to be said, some of the supernatural sides to the film are badly explained remainders from Stephen King's novel and they are irrelevant to the main story plot at some points. Like the mirror that reflects some things but not others and the ghosts that haunt Danny then just stop Nicholson's performance as the abusive father is thrilling and has a kind of black comedy side to it, and the final shot of his face in daylight is brilliance.Jack is a vibrant character, fueled with anger and madly alive in every scene. I regard this film a huge success for Stanley Kubrick, it was not terrifying in the conventional way a horror film is supposed to be. So because it doesn't fit the usual horror genre, some viewers don't like it. But this is the very reason I do like it because it's abstract, clever and at some points even funny and with all of that it still effectively scares the audience.

The Shining is chilling, unforgettable and manages to shock you until the end, with a striking final shot. It's certainly one of the finest horror films ever made!

    The Shining is one of the most chilling and memorable horror movies of all time. The film follows a writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) and his family who are offered a job as winter caretakers for the Overlook Hotel. Despite the dark rumours about the hotel Jack accepts as he believes the quiet will help him overcome his writer's block. Little does he know that the hotel will bring out a lot more than the artistic side of him. Kubrick gives us the eerie, elegant and wonderfully lit spaces of the Overlook Hotel. You sense this isolated and mysterious place the Torrances now call a home isn't quite right, the place is filled with memories of it's violent past and the true horror and suffering that has taken place here is soon revealed. Kubrick tries to simultaneously unfold two stories, one being the hidden secrets the Outlook Hotel possesses and another being a family drama. It has to be said, some of the supernatural sides to the film are badly explained remainders from Stephen King's novel and they are irrelevant to the main story plot at some points. Like the mirror that reflects some things but not others and the ghosts that haunt Danny then just stop Nicholson's performance as the abusive father is thrilling and has a kind of black comedy side to it, and the final shot of his face in daylight is brilliance.Jack is a vibrant character, fueled with anger and madly alive in every scene. I regard this film a huge success for Stanley Kubrick, it was not terrifying in the conventional way a horror film is supposed to be. So because it doesn't fit the usual horror genre, some viewers don't like it. But this is the very reason I do like it because it's abstract, clever and at some points even funny and with all of that it still effectively scares the audience.

    A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father (Jack Nicholson) into violence, while his psychic son (Danny Lloyd) sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future. What is most interesting is that this film has gone from bad to good. When it first came out, the reviews were not so positive, and there were even some Golden Raspberry nominations (but no wins). Today, this is not only considered a top horror film but one of the top 100 films of any genre... what a turnaround. Then we have King's disappointment, and I think he raises serious concerns: he did not like the casting of Nicholson, and he did not think Kubrick made the film as horror-focused as it could have been. On the first point, it is true that the lead should have had a greater transition. Nicholson just looks crazy from the first scene. I would love to have seen Michael Moriarty... As for the Kubrick criticism, it is true... he bent over backwards to make an artsy, stylish film, but maybe not a horror film. It is a great film, but maybe not a great horror film. If you want a good haunting film, for example, "The Changeling" has this one beat...

    Every time one of the best horror of it is that, like a lot of excellent work, based on the Stephen King short story. Jack Nicholson brings his best work by far, is probably the "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a" game film is superior to c. Child actor in the film provides a remarkably good shaping, in which an actor with a similar age not exactly common. Kubrick and the film itself also received a lot of criticism, due to the fact that the film differs significantly from the Mutola used many times and it is unreasonable. But if you know Kubrick's work, you know that it is no coincidence here. Everything that is important, every last detail of a metaphor. And if Kubrick had proved himself exceptionally in the horror genre, I have to say that this is going to him. The film is an indescribable, claustrophobic feel to it, which did the trick: awesome!

    The Shining The best thing about an empty resort is you can combine the tiny shampoo into one normal sized bottle. However, personal hygiene isn't on the mind of the crazed writer in this psychological thriller. Hired to maintain the Overlook Hotel during the winter, Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) moves his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and his mentally gifted son Danny (Danny Lloyd) into the servants' quarters. While he tries to write, Wendy runs maintenance checks, and Danny rides his big wheel past ghostly twin sisters, a hemorrhaging elevator, and the forbidding room 237. Downstairs, Danny's dad - spurned on by an evil bartender - decides to murder his family with an axe. Based on Stephen King's book, director Stanley Kubrik transforms the novel's intuitive narrative into a subversive and superbly shot shocker. Malicious ghosts aside, what would drive most people crazy, would be abstaining from the mini bar for 5 months. Green Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.com

    This is probably the most overrated movie of all times. I'm not a huge horror fan and I get scared very easily, but this movie actually made me laugh or sigh in despair about the lengthiness of the scenes and the predictability of the plot. I read the novel when I was a teen and it beat the crap out of me, I still am afraid of bath tubs in hotel rooms (embarrassing but true). The novel is an all time favourite of me and when I read all the great reviews about Kubick's Shining I was really looking forward to see the movie. What a mistake. For all lovers of the book, this is not a book adaptation, Kubick made his own story...unfortunately. Not only does Dick Hallorann get murdered by Jack - the fact he survives in the novel was one of the reasons I loved the book so much, it has after all somewhat of a happy ending -, but even worse, Kubick turned the whole story around and twisted it to an extend where the original plot is hard to recognize. Jack Torrance is very obviously a mad man right from the beginning who very openly hates his wife and kid, so as others have pointed out before, why didn't he leave his family or killed them before. The whole point of the novel, the normal guy and loving father with a hang to alcohol who gradually gets brainwashed by appearances in the hotel, gets totally lost. One might wonder why the movie even needs the whole hotel plot if Torrance is already mad as a hatter from the very beginning. Apart from this, I guess, had I not read the novel I would probably not understand one bit of what was going on with the characters. But unfortunately that's not all. Also the performances of Nicholson and Duvall were so lousy, it really crept me out. I've never seen Jack Nicholson perform so badly, he seemed like a parody of himself and don't get me started on Shelley Duvall. Periodically I thought I watched some amateur actor in a school play. Her adaptation of Wendy Torrance was so annoying I was staggered between the wish of seeing her chopped to pieces and the wish to see her survive and protect her little boy. The character Wendy in the novel is a strong, resourceful person, the Wendy in the movie is a whiny, weak, and extremely stupid person. The fact that she lays down and sleeps while she is trapped with her 'sick' son and a mad man in a hotel with no contact to the outside world is beneath me. The ending is probably the worst part of the entire movie, on the one hand it's ecstasy as the film draws to an end on the other hand it is as far from the original plot as can be which in this case is an extremely bad thing. The only actor that impressed me was Danny Lloyd, apart from the fact that Kubick partly tried to turn him into a parody of Regan MacNeil I think he did a fantastic job for the little six year old boy he was to that time. He seemed like the only natural actor on the scene. All in all this movie was by far the biggest disappointment I've seen for a long time. Save your time, better read the book.

    I was told that this is a great movie, but after I watched it, it didn't seem to be so good. However, I found out that it's the starting of such a kind of horror film that presents in a closed set and it was even shot at 80's, I realized how incredible it is. The main characters seems to be a little affected considering in today's ways. The black man seems to be a significant character, but he dies so suddenly and it's really makes me confessed. It was created from a novel, but seems to be with some modifications which gives the movie another meaning about Indian Americans as far as I understand. But still, first impression is hard to change~

    Stanley Kubrick directed this (loose) adaptation of Stephen King's superb novel, about married couple Jack & Wendy Torrance(Jack Nicholson & Shelley Duvall) and their young son Danny who go to an isolated Colorado hotel as caretakers for the winter, when the hotel is forced to close. They are met by the head chef Dick Halloran(Scatman Crothers) who recognizes in Danny what he knows about himself: that they have powerful psychic abilities called "Shining" that alerts them to ghostly presences. Unfortunately for them, the hotel, called the Overlook, is indeed haunted with evil and violent ghosts that are determined to destroy them, and then add their spirits to those already there... Genuinely terrifying film is supremely well crafted and directed by Stanley Kubrick, made more frightening by the sinister banshee wailing music score that really gets under the viewer's hide. Fine performances by all, claustrophobic atmosphere and horrifying imagery in this top-class adaptation; though writer Stephen King disliked the changes made to his novel(author's privilege) this film is nonetheless among the top horror pictures ever made. Once seen, not easily forgotten...

    This is an amazing classic thriller that you could watch time and again. This film is filled with beautiful yet horrifying imagery that you remember well after the film has finished. The film is layered with mysterious occurrences that I sometimes after watching multiple times begin to take on new meaning. The entire thing is brilliantly constructed and amazingly imaginative. It's like your worst nightmare come true. The child was brilliantly casted. To me, he's the creepiest of them all. I especially enjoyed the set design and special effects. Everyone should see this film at least once. It is one of my favorites. And I have not read the book so cannot comment on how the film compares.

    I've been meaning to revisit The Shining for the last couple of months and I'm glad I finally did it. Stanley Kubrick succeeded in creating a brilliant psychological horror film with memorable characters and a lot of surreal and fantastical elements. You really need to watch it at least twice in order to understand all the subtle and disturbing allusions. Also, there are many breathtaking landscapes and I am always amazed by Kubrick's exquisite camera work. The first shot showing the river mirroring the mountains and trees or the one where we follow Danny playing in the hotel corridors, not knowing what he will find next are a few examples of the master in action. Now let's talk about the acting. Jack Nicholson delivers a terrific performance as Jack Torrance, making you really believe how insane and tormented his character gradually becomes throughout the film. Shelley Duvall is excellent as Wendy, this very innocent and quirky wife, who will do anything to protect her child. Finally, Danny Lloyd portrays Jack and Wendy's son who has a very peculiar ability and he provides a convincing and solid performance as well. The Shining is chilling, unforgettable and manages to shock you until the end, with a striking final shot. It's certainly one of the finest horror films ever made!

Finally, Danny Lloyd portrays Jack and Wendy's son who has a very peculiar ability and he provides a convincing and solid performance as well. The Shining is chilling, unforgettable and manages to shock you until the end, with a striking final shot. It's certainly one of the finest horror films ever made!

    The Shining is one of the most chilling and memorable horror movies of all time. The film follows a writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) and his family who are offered a job as winter caretakers for the Overlook Hotel. Despite the dark rumours about the hotel Jack accepts as he believes the quiet will help him overcome his writer's block. Little does he know that the hotel will bring out a lot more than the artistic side of him. Kubrick gives us the eerie, elegant and wonderfully lit spaces of the Overlook Hotel. You sense this isolated and mysterious place the Torrances now call a home isn't quite right, the place is filled with memories of it's violent past and the true horror and suffering that has taken place here is soon revealed. Kubrick tries to simultaneously unfold two stories, one being the hidden secrets the Outlook Hotel possesses and another being a family drama. It has to be said, some of the supernatural sides to the film are badly explained remainders from Stephen King's novel and they are irrelevant to the main story plot at some points. Like the mirror that reflects some things but not others and the ghosts that haunt Danny then just stop Nicholson's performance as the abusive father is thrilling and has a kind of black comedy side to it, and the final shot of his face in daylight is brilliance.Jack is a vibrant character, fueled with anger and madly alive in every scene. I regard this film a huge success for Stanley Kubrick, it was not terrifying in the conventional way a horror film is supposed to be. So because it doesn't fit the usual horror genre, some viewers don't like it. But this is the very reason I do like it because it's abstract, clever and at some points even funny and with all of that it still effectively scares the audience.

    A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father (Jack Nicholson) into violence, while his psychic son (Danny Lloyd) sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future. What is most interesting is that this film has gone from bad to good. When it first came out, the reviews were not so positive, and there were even some Golden Raspberry nominations (but no wins). Today, this is not only considered a top horror film but one of the top 100 films of any genre... what a turnaround. Then we have King's disappointment, and I think he raises serious concerns: he did not like the casting of Nicholson, and he did not think Kubrick made the film as horror-focused as it could have been. On the first point, it is true that the lead should have had a greater transition. Nicholson just looks crazy from the first scene. I would love to have seen Michael Moriarty... As for the Kubrick criticism, it is true... he bent over backwards to make an artsy, stylish film, but maybe not a horror film. It is a great film, but maybe not a great horror film. If you want a good haunting film, for example, "The Changeling" has this one beat...

    Every time one of the best horror of it is that, like a lot of excellent work, based on the Stephen King short story. Jack Nicholson brings his best work by far, is probably the "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a" game film is superior to c. Child actor in the film provides a remarkably good shaping, in which an actor with a similar age not exactly common. Kubrick and the film itself also received a lot of criticism, due to the fact that the film differs significantly from the Mutola used many times and it is unreasonable. But if you know Kubrick's work, you know that it is no coincidence here. Everything that is important, every last detail of a metaphor. And if Kubrick had proved himself exceptionally in the horror genre, I have to say that this is going to him. The film is an indescribable, claustrophobic feel to it, which did the trick: awesome!

    The Shining The best thing about an empty resort is you can combine the tiny shampoo into one normal sized bottle. However, personal hygiene isn't on the mind of the crazed writer in this psychological thriller. Hired to maintain the Overlook Hotel during the winter, Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) moves his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and his mentally gifted son Danny (Danny Lloyd) into the servants' quarters. While he tries to write, Wendy runs maintenance checks, and Danny rides his big wheel past ghostly twin sisters, a hemorrhaging elevator, and the forbidding room 237. Downstairs, Danny's dad - spurned on by an evil bartender - decides to murder his family with an axe. Based on Stephen King's book, director Stanley Kubrik transforms the novel's intuitive narrative into a subversive and superbly shot shocker. Malicious ghosts aside, what would drive most people crazy, would be abstaining from the mini bar for 5 months. Green Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.com

    This is probably the most overrated movie of all times. I'm not a huge horror fan and I get scared very easily, but this movie actually made me laugh or sigh in despair about the lengthiness of the scenes and the predictability of the plot. I read the novel when I was a teen and it beat the crap out of me, I still am afraid of bath tubs in hotel rooms (embarrassing but true). The novel is an all time favourite of me and when I read all the great reviews about Kubick's Shining I was really looking forward to see the movie. What a mistake. For all lovers of the book, this is not a book adaptation, Kubick made his own story...unfortunately. Not only does Dick Hallorann get murdered by Jack - the fact he survives in the novel was one of the reasons I loved the book so much, it has after all somewhat of a happy ending -, but even worse, Kubick turned the whole story around and twisted it to an extend where the original plot is hard to recognize. Jack Torrance is very obviously a mad man right from the beginning who very openly hates his wife and kid, so as others have pointed out before, why didn't he leave his family or killed them before. The whole point of the novel, the normal guy and loving father with a hang to alcohol who gradually gets brainwashed by appearances in the hotel, gets totally lost. One might wonder why the movie even needs the whole hotel plot if Torrance is already mad as a hatter from the very beginning. Apart from this, I guess, had I not read the novel I would probably not understand one bit of what was going on with the characters. But unfortunately that's not all. Also the performances of Nicholson and Duvall were so lousy, it really crept me out. I've never seen Jack Nicholson perform so badly, he seemed like a parody of himself and don't get me started on Shelley Duvall. Periodically I thought I watched some amateur actor in a school play. Her adaptation of Wendy Torrance was so annoying I was staggered between the wish of seeing her chopped to pieces and the wish to see her survive and protect her little boy. The character Wendy in the novel is a strong, resourceful person, the Wendy in the movie is a whiny, weak, and extremely stupid person. The fact that she lays down and sleeps while she is trapped with her 'sick' son and a mad man in a hotel with no contact to the outside world is beneath me. The ending is probably the worst part of the entire movie, on the one hand it's ecstasy as the film draws to an end on the other hand it is as far from the original plot as can be which in this case is an extremely bad thing. The only actor that impressed me was Danny Lloyd, apart from the fact that Kubick partly tried to turn him into a parody of Regan MacNeil I think he did a fantastic job for the little six year old boy he was to that time. He seemed like the only natural actor on the scene. All in all this movie was by far the biggest disappointment I've seen for a long time. Save your time, better read the book.

    I was told that this is a great movie, but after I watched it, it didn't seem to be so good. However, I found out that it's the starting of such a kind of horror film that presents in a closed set and it was even shot at 80's, I realized how incredible it is. The main characters seems to be a little affected considering in today's ways. The black man seems to be a significant character, but he dies so suddenly and it's really makes me confessed. It was created from a novel, but seems to be with some modifications which gives the movie another meaning about Indian Americans as far as I understand. But still, first impression is hard to change~

    Stanley Kubrick directed this (loose) adaptation of Stephen King's superb novel, about married couple Jack & Wendy Torrance(Jack Nicholson & Shelley Duvall) and their young son Danny who go to an isolated Colorado hotel as caretakers for the winter, when the hotel is forced to close. They are met by the head chef Dick Halloran(Scatman Crothers) who recognizes in Danny what he knows about himself: that they have powerful psychic abilities called "Shining" that alerts them to ghostly presences. Unfortunately for them, the hotel, called the Overlook, is indeed haunted with evil and violent ghosts that are determined to destroy them, and then add their spirits to those already there... Genuinely terrifying film is supremely well crafted and directed by Stanley Kubrick, made more frightening by the sinister banshee wailing music score that really gets under the viewer's hide. Fine performances by all, claustrophobic atmosphere and horrifying imagery in this top-class adaptation; though writer Stephen King disliked the changes made to his novel(author's privilege) this film is nonetheless among the top horror pictures ever made. Once seen, not easily forgotten...

    This is an amazing classic thriller that you could watch time and again. This film is filled with beautiful yet horrifying imagery that you remember well after the film has finished. The film is layered with mysterious occurrences that I sometimes after watching multiple times begin to take on new meaning. The entire thing is brilliantly constructed and amazingly imaginative. It's like your worst nightmare come true. The child was brilliantly casted. To me, he's the creepiest of them all. I especially enjoyed the set design and special effects. Everyone should see this film at least once. It is one of my favorites. And I have not read the book so cannot comment on how the film compares.

    I've been meaning to revisit The Shining for the last couple of months and I'm glad I finally did it. Stanley Kubrick succeeded in creating a brilliant psychological horror film with memorable characters and a lot of surreal and fantastical elements. You really need to watch it at least twice in order to understand all the subtle and disturbing allusions. Also, there are many breathtaking landscapes and I am always amazed by Kubrick's exquisite camera work. The first shot showing the river mirroring the mountains and trees or the one where we follow Danny playing in the hotel corridors, not knowing what he will find next are a few examples of the master in action. Now let's talk about the acting. Jack Nicholson delivers a terrific performance as Jack Torrance, making you really believe how insane and tormented his character gradually becomes throughout the film. Shelley Duvall is excellent as Wendy, this very innocent and quirky wife, who will do anything to protect her child. Finally, Danny Lloyd portrays Jack and Wendy's son who has a very peculiar ability and he provides a convincing and solid performance as well.

Finally, Danny Lloyd portrays Jack and Wendy's son who has a very peculiar ability and he provides a convincing and solid performance as well. The Shining is chilling, unforgettable and manages to shock you until the end, with a striking final shot. It's certainly one of the finest horror films ever made!

    The Shining is one of the most chilling and memorable horror movies of all time. The film follows a writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) and his family who are offered a job as winter caretakers for the Overlook Hotel. Despite the dark rumours about the hotel Jack accepts as he believes the quiet will help him overcome his writer's block. Little does he know that the hotel will bring out a lot more than the artistic side of him. Kubrick gives us the eerie, elegant and wonderfully lit spaces of the Overlook Hotel. You sense this isolated and mysterious place the Torrances now call a home isn't quite right, the place is filled with memories of it's violent past and the true horror and suffering that has taken place here is soon revealed. Kubrick tries to simultaneously unfold two stories, one being the hidden secrets the Outlook Hotel possesses and another being a family drama. It has to be said, some of the supernatural sides to the film are badly explained remainders from Stephen King's novel and they are irrelevant to the main story plot at some points. Like the mirror that reflects some things but not others and the ghosts that haunt Danny then just stop Nicholson's performance as the abusive father is thrilling and has a kind of black comedy side to it, and the final shot of his face in daylight is brilliance.Jack is a vibrant character, fueled with anger and madly alive in every scene. I regard this film a huge success for Stanley Kubrick, it was not terrifying in the conventional way a horror film is supposed to be. So because it doesn't fit the usual horror genre, some viewers don't like it. But this is the very reason I do like it because it's abstract, clever and at some points even funny and with all of that it still effectively scares the audience.

    A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father (Jack Nicholson) into violence, while his psychic son (Danny Lloyd) sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future. What is most interesting is that this film has gone from bad to good. When it first came out, the reviews were not so positive, and there were even some Golden Raspberry nominations (but no wins). Today, this is not only considered a top horror film but one of the top 100 films of any genre... what a turnaround. Then we have King's disappointment, and I think he raises serious concerns: he did not like the casting of Nicholson, and he did not think Kubrick made the film as horror-focused as it could have been. On the first point, it is true that the lead should have had a greater transition. Nicholson just looks crazy from the first scene. I would love to have seen Michael Moriarty... As for the Kubrick criticism, it is true... he bent over backwards to make an artsy, stylish film, but maybe not a horror film. It is a great film, but maybe not a great horror film. If you want a good haunting film, for example, "The Changeling" has this one beat...

    Every time one of the best horror of it is that, like a lot of excellent work, based on the Stephen King short story. Jack Nicholson brings his best work by far, is probably the "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a" game film is superior to c. Child actor in the film provides a remarkably good shaping, in which an actor with a similar age not exactly common. Kubrick and the film itself also received a lot of criticism, due to the fact that the film differs significantly from the Mutola used many times and it is unreasonable. But if you know Kubrick's work, you know that it is no coincidence here. Everything that is important, every last detail of a metaphor. And if Kubrick had proved himself exceptionally in the horror genre, I have to say that this is going to him. The film is an indescribable, claustrophobic feel to it, which did the trick: awesome!

    The Shining The best thing about an empty resort is you can combine the tiny shampoo into one normal sized bottle. However, personal hygiene isn't on the mind of the crazed writer in this psychological thriller. Hired to maintain the Overlook Hotel during the winter, Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) moves his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and his mentally gifted son Danny (Danny Lloyd) into the servants' quarters. While he tries to write, Wendy runs maintenance checks, and Danny rides his big wheel past ghostly twin sisters, a hemorrhaging elevator, and the forbidding room 237. Downstairs, Danny's dad - spurned on by an evil bartender - decides to murder his family with an axe. Based on Stephen King's book, director Stanley Kubrik transforms the novel's intuitive narrative into a subversive and superbly shot shocker. Malicious ghosts aside, what would drive most people crazy, would be abstaining from the mini bar for 5 months. Green Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.com

    This is probably the most overrated movie of all times. I'm not a huge horror fan and I get scared very easily, but this movie actually made me laugh or sigh in despair about the lengthiness of the scenes and the predictability of the plot. I read the novel when I was a teen and it beat the crap out of me, I still am afraid of bath tubs in hotel rooms (embarrassing but true). The novel is an all time favourite of me and when I read all the great reviews about Kubick's Shining I was really looking forward to see the movie. What a mistake. For all lovers of the book, this is not a book adaptation, Kubick made his own story...unfortunately. Not only does Dick Hallorann get murdered by Jack - the fact he survives in the novel was one of the reasons I loved the book so much, it has after all somewhat of a happy ending -, but even worse, Kubick turned the whole story around and twisted it to an extend where the original plot is hard to recognize. Jack Torrance is very obviously a mad man right from the beginning who very openly hates his wife and kid, so as others have pointed out before, why didn't he leave his family or killed them before. The whole point of the novel, the normal guy and loving father with a hang to alcohol who gradually gets brainwashed by appearances in the hotel, gets totally lost. One might wonder why the movie even needs the whole hotel plot if Torrance is already mad as a hatter from the very beginning. Apart from this, I guess, had I not read the novel I would probably not understand one bit of what was going on with the characters. But unfortunately that's not all. Also the performances of Nicholson and Duvall were so lousy, it really crept me out. I've never seen Jack Nicholson perform so badly, he seemed like a parody of himself and don't get me started on Shelley Duvall. Periodically I thought I watched some amateur actor in a school play. Her adaptation of Wendy Torrance was so annoying I was staggered between the wish of seeing her chopped to pieces and the wish to see her survive and protect her little boy. The character Wendy in the novel is a strong, resourceful person, the Wendy in the movie is a whiny, weak, and extremely stupid person. The fact that she lays down and sleeps while she is trapped with her 'sick' son and a mad man in a hotel with no contact to the outside world is beneath me. The ending is probably the worst part of the entire movie, on the one hand it's ecstasy as the film draws to an end on the other hand it is as far from the original plot as can be which in this case is an extremely bad thing. The only actor that impressed me was Danny Lloyd, apart from the fact that Kubick partly tried to turn him into a parody of Regan MacNeil I think he did a fantastic job for the little six year old boy he was to that time. He seemed like the only natural actor on the scene. All in all this movie was by far the biggest disappointment I've seen for a long time. Save your time, better read the book.

    I was told that this is a great movie, but after I watched it, it didn't seem to be so good. However, I found out that it's the starting of such a kind of horror film that presents in a closed set and it was even shot at 80's, I realized how incredible it is. The main characters seems to be a little affected considering in today's ways. The black man seems to be a significant character, but he dies so suddenly and it's really makes me confessed. It was created from a novel, but seems to be with some modifications which gives the movie another meaning about Indian Americans as far as I understand. But still, first impression is hard to change~

    Stanley Kubrick directed this (loose) adaptation of Stephen King's superb novel, about married couple Jack & Wendy Torrance(Jack Nicholson & Shelley Duvall) and their young son Danny who go to an isolated Colorado hotel as caretakers for the winter, when the hotel is forced to close. They are met by the head chef Dick Halloran(Scatman Crothers) who recognizes in Danny what he knows about himself: that they have powerful psychic abilities called "Shining" that alerts them to ghostly presences. Unfortunately for them, the hotel, called the Overlook, is indeed haunted with evil and violent ghosts that are determined to destroy them, and then add their spirits to those already there... Genuinely terrifying film is supremely well crafted and directed by Stanley Kubrick, made more frightening by the sinister banshee wailing music score that really gets under the viewer's hide. Fine performances by all, claustrophobic atmosphere and horrifying imagery in this top-class adaptation; though writer Stephen King disliked the changes made to his novel(author's privilege) this film is nonetheless among the top horror pictures ever made. Once seen, not easily forgotten...

    This is an amazing classic thriller that you could watch time and again. This film is filled with beautiful yet horrifying imagery that you remember well after the film has finished. The film is layered with mysterious occurrences that I sometimes after watching multiple times begin to take on new meaning. The entire thing is brilliantly constructed and amazingly imaginative. It's like your worst nightmare come true. The child was brilliantly casted. To me, he's the creepiest of them all. I especially enjoyed the set design and special effects. Everyone should see this film at least once. It is one of my favorites. And I have not read the book so cannot comment on how the film compares.

    I've been meaning to revisit The Shining for the last couple of months and I'm glad I finally did it. Stanley Kubrick succeeded in creating a brilliant psychological horror film with memorable characters and a lot of surreal and fantastical elements. You really need to watch it at least twice in order to understand all the subtle and disturbing allusions. Also, there are many breathtaking landscapes and I am always amazed by Kubrick's exquisite camera work. The first shot showing the river mirroring the mountains and trees or the one where we follow Danny playing in the hotel corridors, not knowing what he will find next are a few examples of the master in action. Now let's talk about the acting. Jack Nicholson delivers a terrific performance as Jack Torrance, making you really believe how insane and tormented his character gradually becomes throughout the film. Shelley Duvall is excellent as Wendy, this very innocent and quirky wife, who will do anything to protect her child. Finally, Danny Lloyd portrays Jack and Wendy's son who has a very peculiar ability and he provides a convincing and solid performance as well.

Finally, Danny Lloyd portrays Jack and Wendy's son who has a very peculiar ability and he provides a convincing and solid performance as well. The Shining is chilling, unforgettable and manages to shock you until the end, with a striking final shot. It's certainly one of the finest horror films ever made!

    The Shining is one of the most chilling and memorable horror movies of all time. The film follows a writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) and his family who are offered a job as winter caretakers for the Overlook Hotel. Despite the dark rumours about the hotel Jack accepts as he believes the quiet will help him overcome his writer's block. Little does he know that the hotel will bring out a lot more than the artistic side of him. Kubrick gives us the eerie, elegant and wonderfully lit spaces of the Overlook Hotel. You sense this isolated and mysterious place the Torrances now call a home isn't quite right, the place is filled with memories of it's violent past and the true horror and suffering that has taken place here is soon revealed. Kubrick tries to simultaneously unfold two stories, one being the hidden secrets the Outlook Hotel possesses and another being a family drama. It has to be said, some of the supernatural sides to the film are badly explained remainders from Stephen King's novel and they are irrelevant to the main story plot at some points. Like the mirror that reflects some things but not others and the ghosts that haunt Danny then just stop Nicholson's performance as the abusive father is thrilling and has a kind of black comedy side to it, and the final shot of his face in daylight is brilliance.Jack is a vibrant character, fueled with anger and madly alive in every scene. I regard this film a huge success for Stanley Kubrick, it was not terrifying in the conventional way a horror film is supposed to be. So because it doesn't fit the usual horror genre, some viewers don't like it. But this is the very reason I do like it because it's abstract, clever and at some points even funny and with all of that it still effectively scares the audience.

    A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father (Jack Nicholson) into violence, while his psychic son (Danny Lloyd) sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future. What is most interesting is that this film has gone from bad to good. When it first came out, the reviews were not so positive, and there were even some Golden Raspberry nominations (but no wins). Today, this is not only considered a top horror film but one of the top 100 films of any genre... what a turnaround. Then we have King's disappointment, and I think he raises serious concerns: he did not like the casting of Nicholson, and he did not think Kubrick made the film as horror-focused as it could have been. On the first point, it is true that the lead should have had a greater transition. Nicholson just looks crazy from the first scene. I would love to have seen Michael Moriarty... As for the Kubrick criticism, it is true... he bent over backwards to make an artsy, stylish film, but maybe not a horror film. It is a great film, but maybe not a great horror film. If you want a good haunting film, for example, "The Changeling" has this one beat...

    Every time one of the best horror of it is that, like a lot of excellent work, based on the Stephen King short story. Jack Nicholson brings his best work by far, is probably the "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a" game film is superior to c. Child actor in the film provides a remarkably good shaping, in which an actor with a similar age not exactly common. Kubrick and the film itself also received a lot of criticism, due to the fact that the film differs significantly from the Mutola used many times and it is unreasonable. But if you know Kubrick's work, you know that it is no coincidence here. Everything that is important, every last detail of a metaphor. And if Kubrick had proved himself exceptionally in the horror genre, I have to say that this is going to him. The film is an indescribable, claustrophobic feel to it, which did the trick: awesome!

    The Shining The best thing about an empty resort is you can combine the tiny shampoo into one normal sized bottle. However, personal hygiene isn't on the mind of the crazed writer in this psychological thriller. Hired to maintain the Overlook Hotel during the winter, Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) moves his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and his mentally gifted son Danny (Danny Lloyd) into the servants' quarters. While he tries to write, Wendy runs maintenance checks, and Danny rides his big wheel past ghostly twin sisters, a hemorrhaging elevator, and the forbidding room 237. Downstairs, Danny's dad - spurned on by an evil bartender - decides to murder his family with an axe. Based on Stephen King's book, director Stanley Kubrik transforms the novel's intuitive narrative into a subversive and superbly shot shocker. Malicious ghosts aside, what would drive most people crazy, would be abstaining from the mini bar for 5 months. Green Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.com

    This is probably the most overrated movie of all times. I'm not a huge horror fan and I get scared very easily, but this movie actually made me laugh or sigh in despair about the lengthiness of the scenes and the predictability of the plot. I read the novel when I was a teen and it beat the crap out of me, I still am afraid of bath tubs in hotel rooms (embarrassing but true). The novel is an all time favourite of me and when I read all the great reviews about Kubick's Shining I was really looking forward to see the movie. What a mistake. For all lovers of the book, this is not a book adaptation, Kubick made his own story...unfortunately. Not only does Dick Hallorann get murdered by Jack - the fact he survives in the novel was one of the reasons I loved the book so much, it has after all somewhat of a happy ending -, but even worse, Kubick turned the whole story around and twisted it to an extend where the original plot is hard to recognize. Jack Torrance is very obviously a mad man right from the beginning who very openly hates his wife and kid, so as others have pointed out before, why didn't he leave his family or killed them before. The whole point of the novel, the normal guy and loving father with a hang to alcohol who gradually gets brainwashed by appearances in the hotel, gets totally lost. One might wonder why the movie even needs the whole hotel plot if Torrance is already mad as a hatter from the very beginning. Apart from this, I guess, had I not read the novel I would probably not understand one bit of what was going on with the characters. But unfortunately that's not all. Also the performances of Nicholson and Duvall were so lousy, it really crept me out. I've never seen Jack Nicholson perform so badly, he seemed like a parody of himself and don't get me started on Shelley Duvall. Periodically I thought I watched some amateur actor in a school play. Her adaptation of Wendy Torrance was so annoying I was staggered between the wish of seeing her chopped to pieces and the wish to see her survive and protect her little boy. The character Wendy in the novel is a strong, resourceful person, the Wendy in the movie is a whiny, weak, and extremely stupid person. The fact that she lays down and sleeps while she is trapped with her 'sick' son and a mad man in a hotel with no contact to the outside world is beneath me. The ending is probably the worst part of the entire movie, on the one hand it's ecstasy as the film draws to an end on the other hand it is as far from the original plot as can be which in this case is an extremely bad thing. The only actor that impressed me was Danny Lloyd, apart from the fact that Kubick partly tried to turn him into a parody of Regan MacNeil I think he did a fantastic job for the little six year old boy he was to that time. He seemed like the only natural actor on the scene. All in all this movie was by far the biggest disappointment I've seen for a long time. Save your time, better read the book.

    I was told that this is a great movie, but after I watched it, it didn't seem to be so good. However, I found out that it's the starting of such a kind of horror film that presents in a closed set and it was even shot at 80's, I realized how incredible it is. The main characters seems to be a little affected considering in today's ways. The black man seems to be a significant character, but he dies so suddenly and it's really makes me confessed. It was created from a novel, but seems to be with some modifications which gives the movie another meaning about Indian Americans as far as I understand. But still, first impression is hard to change~

    Stanley Kubrick directed this (loose) adaptation of Stephen King's superb novel, about married couple Jack & Wendy Torrance(Jack Nicholson & Shelley Duvall) and their young son Danny who go to an isolated Colorado hotel as caretakers for the winter, when the hotel is forced to close. They are met by the head chef Dick Halloran(Scatman Crothers) who recognizes in Danny what he knows about himself: that they have powerful psychic abilities called "Shining" that alerts them to ghostly presences. Unfortunately for them, the hotel, called the Overlook, is indeed haunted with evil and violent ghosts that are determined to destroy them, and then add their spirits to those already there... Genuinely terrifying film is supremely well crafted and directed by Stanley Kubrick, made more frightening by the sinister banshee wailing music score that really gets under the viewer's hide. Fine performances by all, claustrophobic atmosphere and horrifying imagery in this top-class adaptation; though writer Stephen King disliked the changes made to his novel(author's privilege) this film is nonetheless among the top horror pictures ever made. Once seen, not easily forgotten...

    This is an amazing classic thriller that you could watch time and again. This film is filled with beautiful yet horrifying imagery that you remember well after the film has finished. The film is layered with mysterious occurrences that I sometimes after watching multiple times begin to take on new meaning. The entire thing is brilliantly constructed and amazingly imaginative. It's like your worst nightmare come true. The child was brilliantly casted. To me, he's the creepiest of them all. I especially enjoyed the set design and special effects. Everyone should see this film at least once. It is one of my favorites. And I have not read the book so cannot comment on how the film compares.

    I've been meaning to revisit The Shining for the last couple of months and I'm glad I finally did it. Stanley Kubrick succeeded in creating a brilliant psychological horror film with memorable characters and a lot of surreal and fantastical elements. You really need to watch it at least twice in order to understand all the subtle and disturbing allusions. Also, there are many breathtaking landscapes and I am always amazed by Kubrick's exquisite camera work. The first shot showing the river mirroring the mountains and trees or the one where we follow Danny playing in the hotel corridors, not knowing what he will find next are a few examples of the master in action. Now let's talk about the acting. Jack Nicholson delivers a terrific performance as Jack Torrance, making you really believe how insane and tormented his character gradually becomes throughout the film. Shelley Duvall is excellent as Wendy, this very innocent and quirky wife, who will do anything to protect her child. Finally, Danny Lloyd portrays Jack and Wendy's son who has a very peculiar ability and he provides a convincing and solid performance as well.

Finally, Danny Lloyd portrays Jack and Wendy's son who has a very peculiar ability and he provides a convincing and solid performance as well. The Shining is chilling, unforgettable and manages to shock you until the end, with a striking final shot. It's certainly one of the finest horror films ever made!

    The Shining is one of the most chilling and memorable horror movies of all time. The film follows a writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) and his family who are offered a job as winter caretakers for the Overlook Hotel. Despite the dark rumours about the hotel Jack accepts as he believes the quiet will help him overcome his writer's block. Little does he know that the hotel will bring out a lot more than the artistic side of him. Kubrick gives us the eerie, elegant and wonderfully lit spaces of the Overlook Hotel. You sense this isolated and mysterious place the Torrances now call a home isn't quite right, the place is filled with memories of it's violent past and the true horror and suffering that has taken place here is soon revealed. Kubrick tries to simultaneously unfold two stories, one being the hidden secrets the Outlook Hotel possesses and another being a family drama. It has to be said, some of the supernatural sides to the film are badly explained remainders from Stephen King's novel and they are irrelevant to the main story plot at some points. Like the mirror that reflects some things but not others and the ghosts that haunt Danny then just stop Nicholson's performance as the abusive father is thrilling and has a kind of black comedy side to it, and the final shot of his face in daylight is brilliance.Jack is a vibrant character, fueled with anger and madly alive in every scene. I regard this film a huge success for Stanley Kubrick, it was not terrifying in the conventional way a horror film is supposed to be. So because it doesn't fit the usual horror genre, some viewers don't like it. But this is the very reason I do like it because it's abstract, clever and at some points even funny and with all of that it still effectively scares the audience.
