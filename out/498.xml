 <sinopse>
  In Africa during WW1, a gin-swilling riverboat owner/captain is persuaded by a strait-laced missionary to use his boat to attack an enemy warship.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  September 1914, news reaches the colony German Eastern Africa that Germany is at war, so Reverend Samuel Sayer became a hostile foreigner. German imperial troops burn down his mission; he is beaten and dies of fever. His well-educated, snobbish sister Rose Sayer buries him and leaves by the only available transport, the dilapidated river steamboat 'African Queen' of grumpy Charlie Allnut. As if a long difficult journey without any comfort weren't bad enough for such odd companions, she is determined to find a way to do their bit for the British war effort (and revenge her brother) and aims high as God is obviously on their side: construct their own equipment, a torpedo and the converted steamboat, to take out a huge German warship, the Louisa, which is hard to find on the giant lake and first of all to reach, in fact as daunting an expedition as anyone attempted since the late adventurous explorer John Speakes, but she presses till Charlie accepts to steam up the Ulana, about to brave...

    Charlie Allnut is a rascal. He is also a boat captain in Africa, who ferries things up and down the river in 1914. One day he stops at a missionary, where prim Rose Sayer is preaching along with her brother. Charlie has tea with them, but to say they get along is an overstatement. Charlie leaves, but not before telling the English Rose and her brother that Germany has declared war. Soon after he leaves, the camp is taken over by Germans, who burn the huts down and leave Rose and her brother to fend for them selves. Her brother catches the fever, and dies. It is then that Charlie comes back. He helps Rose bury her brother, and then asks her along to wait out the war in the jungle. Soon after, they find a place to hide, when Rose begins to look at a map. She asks Charlie why they can't go up the river, and he tells her that there are rapids, a German fort, waterfalls, and at the end, a big German steamer, patrolling the lake so the British can't move down. Noticing Charlie has a lot of explosives, that he was carrying for the mine, Rose asks if they can't ride to the lake, and then blow up the German steamer. Charlie says no, but Rose persists, and you can see where this is going. I know it sounds dark, but it is really anything but. There is one thing that can impede you from enjoying The African Queen: cynicism. You cannot look at this film from a cynical point of view. You'll hate it. That said, you can going into it being cynical, but you have to drop it after five minutes. Okay, got it? Good, we can move on. Three films have been called Huston's best: The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of The Sierra Madre and The African Queen. At least, from what I've heard. I did not like The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre, and as I have not reviewed The Maltese Falcon, I'll hold judgment until then. So what is Huston's best film? The African Queen, from what I've seen. Many people have tried to describe the essence of this film. Is it Bogart, Hepburn or Huston? Is it the shooting on location? Or maybe the story? I cannot pinpoint the film's greatness. It is like a cozy den, that once you've entered, you never want to leave. The only other film I've had such a reaction to is Casablanca. It is a great film, but why? The performances by Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn are certainly part of that magic.You only have to see them on screen for a second, and you are instantly with them. Bogart plays the kind of character only Bogart could play, and likewise with Hepburn. They inhabit their characters with an energy that cannot be defined. You do not think of them as Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, but as Rose Sayer and Charlie Allnut. The characters are that memorable. It is the kind of love story that feels alive and fresh, despite how in a different film it would seem clich&eacute;d. Here it embraces the clich&eacute;, and is better because of it. The development feels like a natural extension of the plot. Speaking of plot, the screenplay by James Agee and John Huston achieves that perfect balance of giving you a plot that keeps you interested, and two leads you cannot help but love. Agee had a heart attack before he could finish the screenplay, so Huston brought it down to Africa to finish it. He brought Peter Viertel to work on it with him, and sometimes they would write the next scene the day before it was shot. Shooting on an actual river in Africa must have presented a massive challenge for the cinematographer, but he succeeded admirably. The film is neither a walking travel ad, but it doesn't forget about it's landscape either. Perhaps the only weak link is the score, but even that can not impede the film from greatness. This brings me to Huston's direction. He has often been accused of his films looking staged, with no amazing cinematic tricks employed. I cannot defend him, but I can say this. Huston is a director. He is not an actor's director, a cinematographer's director, or a screenwriters director. He is truly a director, he oversees all aspects of production with the same wise gaze. He is not an auteur. He trusts the people he works with to do a good job, and just oversees them doing it. This kind of film making is the only kind that would work for The African Queen. And it does, Huston delivers yet another beautiful adventure film. If you are feeling low, this is the kind of film that can make you feel better. When I gave The Dead ten stars, it took me a while to make the decision. Here it took me a second. The African Queen is an indisputable masterpiece, for now and for always. The African Queen, 1951, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn and Robert Morely, Directed by John Huston, 10/10 (A+) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

    always put off watching this movie as the combination of Bogart and Hepburn didn't interest me. decided to watch it to night as there was nothing else on the screen. well...i loved the film and i was completely entranced by Mr. Bogart. too see him smile....at last and his drunk scenes were absolutely on track. sure the story line is a bit...exaggerated but it still is a poignant movie. Katherine Hepburn another one who never captured my heart is quite good in this one. she has an ability to feed the other actors right on with her replies and reactions. now I'm glad I've watched it and recommend it to all people who like good acting and a movie that has thrills....sentimentality....and humour.

    Just like brandy, The African Queen gets better with age. Humphrey Bogart (Charlie Allnut) won a best actor Academy award for his great performance. He beat Marlon Brando (A Streetcar Named Desire)....and that was a correct decision. Early in his career Bogey was mostly a bootlegger, then came his period of playing "private Dicks". Few people knew he could REALLY act. Then in the Treasure of Sierra Madre and this great movie, he showed what he could do. Katherine Hepburn was at least as good as Meryl Streep....and in this wonderful film she once again shows her class. The African Queen is about ..the strangeness of love..how little boats can do Titanical things..and that entertainment is (and always will be) the reason we visit cinemas. Having a good script is so important to any movie .. Bogey and Kate deliver there lines with aplomb. There is a lot of fun in The African Queen, and this 1951 film delivers at all levels. John Huston (a close friend of Bogey) directs probably his best movie. Bogey did not like working on location, but thankfully Huston advised him that there would be enough booze for the whole shoot..!!

    Recently I watched The African Queen and at first I had my doubts; but after finishing the film it was awesome. A timeless movies that cannot be remade or re-casted as Bogart and Hepburn at their best. Something that will be remembered as one of the moments to be modelled for todays cinematic experience. The movie is based on a novel written by C.S forester about 2 couples played by Hepburn and Bogart going through outrageous circumstances against the Germans. But more importantly it is about the spectacular chemistry between Hepburn and Bogart going through the times of the German war time era. A film where the Technicolour vision makes the movie come alive. Overall I would highly recommend this movie if you ever get the chance. A rare gem that beenfound to shine through the years for a fresh look at an phenomenal casting, directing and location.

    In central Africa, while War World 2 is affecting the world, a humble and simple boat captain and an elderly English missionary woman join forces, although reluctant with staying with one another, to travel on the captain's small boat (The African Queen) in order to sink a German ship, and to escape the woman's village of residence, raided by the Germans. In the small boat, the formalities and class differences become less and less obvious, until affection between the two protagonists explodes. Director John Huston, always eclectic in his choice of movies, puts in The African Queen big sparks of Romance and Light Comedy, Adventure, but also serious Drama, because of the dramatic background of the period depicted. One of those great Hollywood classics that shaped many modern films, because of it's original setting (Africa, too, was touched by the war, so the circumstances are very familiar) and situation of the characters, who slowly brake all bonds of formality. A bit rushed ending, with too much going on at once.

    In the 1950's,location shooting was a rarity,so the locale selected,everyone involved with this production knew it was going to be very hard work to get this film made.They just didn't know how tough until work began.I guess it helped to have one of the best directors of that day (not to mention in all of cinema history),John Huston,paired with two of the best actors to grace the screen,Humphrey Bogart and Kate Hepburn.The story is very captivating,and these cinema giants,working harder than usual under very adverse conditions,managed to come up with a winner.Definitely on the must see list for any classic cinema fan.

    As I write this The African Queen is sitting at a 9/10 rating on IMDb, with 86 percent giving it a 10/10. That makes it one of the most blatantly skewed ratings I have ever seen on IMDb, because this movie is awful. It is just plain bad. So it is clear to me that the studios have gotten pretty good at gaming the IMDb rating. I've noticed that ratings are often skewed pretty high on IMDb, and it has only gotten worse. But The African Queen takes the cake in terms of a dreadfully bad movie getting an impossibly high rating for what it is. Why is it bad? The script is like a work of fan fiction, and not in a good way. When you are seeing a movie for the first time and you are completing the actor's lines before they are, clearly it is lacking in any originality. There is zero tension. Even the decent actors in this movie deliver very poor performances. But I think they simply had nothing to work with. There is only so much an actor can do to salvage bad writing. And in this case, there was nothing they could do. And the special effects are very underwhelming. What kills me is that the boats in the Krakatoa, East of Java movie were much more impressive than the shippage in The African Queen, where they simply look like kind of plastic models flailing about in an old wash tub . I won't go on and on about how bad it is because it has already taken two hours of my life away. But suffice to say that this is an extremely uninspired film which I am sure Bogart will rank as one of his worst. And IMDb, the studio owned you on this one. This is nowhere near a 9/10, or even a 6 for that matter. Don't see it. Not even as a rental, or even on Blu Ray, HD, or whatever is next.

    I had caught the end of this film before but somehow had never watched it all the way through so when I saw it listed in the TV guide I had to watch it; now, having seen it, I can see why it is considered a classic. The film opens in 1914 in German East Africa, present day Tanzania, where an English missionary and his sister are taking a church service. They are interrupted by the steam boat 'African Queen' and her captain Charlie Allnut. He informs them of the war that has broken out in Europe and as such they are stranded in an enemy country. It isn't long before the Germans turn up and burn down the village; they leave the missionaries but the affect leaves the preacher a broken man and he soon dies. When Allnut returns he takes the sister, Rosie Sayer, aboard his boat and sets off down river. He suggests they find an island and sit the war out but she has other ideas... she wants to continue down river, past a German fort, over deadly rapids and on to the lake. This lake is patrolled by the German ship the Queen Louisa which is the only thing keeping British forces from attacking the German colony. She intends to take their small boat and sink the Louisa! I really enjoyed this film; Bogart was great as the gin-swilling steamer captain and Katherine Hepburn was equally good as the prim sister of the preacher; the two of them had a great on screen chemistry. Director John Huston did a fine job creating an exciting story; I was surprised just how good some of the special effects looked; it really looked like their small boat was being tossed around in the rapids even though a model was used... it helped of course that much of the movie was filmed on location in Africa; the scenery looked real because it was! While at heart the film is a romantic story between the two very different characters I couldn't help thinking about the film 'Apocalypse Now' as the boat went further and further along the river getting into various scrapes and approaching the deadly conclusion to its mission... this film is of course much lighter in tone! That isn't to say there isn't tension and more than once it looks as if the two protagonists are going to die before completing their self-given mission. If you want a good adventure that is suitable for all ages you could do a lot worse than this... I highly recommend it.

    When defending predictable, formulaic films, I often hear that "it's the road from A to B that matters". But when that road, as in The African Queen, in which A is Humphrey Bogart's ragged boatman and Katharine Hepburn's stern missionary not standing each other and B is them falling hopelessly in love, is not very interesting or entertaining, you have a problem. It's strange, everything I remembered about The African Queen was less pronounced now that I watched it again, for both better and worse. Firstly, the distance between A and B was a lot shorter  in the beginning, there was more of a slight annoyance or a stiff reservation than a downright hatred or dislike, and it didn't take very long before they fell into each other's arms. Secondly, Hepburn's character was a lot less annoying. I still don't think she (or Bogart) is very good, but I didn't exactly want her to die this time, and I guess their chemistry is all right. The romance was probably a bit less sappy, whereas the adventure and the finale were decidedly less riveting. One thing I did notice to a larger extent now was the pleasant Technicolor work, which is used to the greatest effect when there is a lot of nature on the screen, such as the opening scene where the camera sneaks through the jungle and enters the East African village of Kungdu. But other than that, The African Queen is still just a decent romantic adventure that I don't quite get the praise for.

    The African Queen is a fantastically told story of a gin-swilling riverboat captain and an uptight Methodist missionary. When the movie begins, we are told that the First World War is about to begin. Two Methodist missionaries, a brother and sister, are forced to deal with the German forces that invade the village at which they teach, as it is a British colony. The confrontation ends up killing the brother, leaving his sister, Rose, played marvelously by the always enjoyable Katharine Hepburn, to fend for herself. She takes in with a riverboat captain, played by the immensely talented Humphrey Bogart, named Charlie, who captains the smallish steamship, the African Queen. Their journey takes them down the Ulanga River in Africa. At the beginning of their journey, Rose devises a plan to retaliate against the Germans, for her country, and also to avenge her brother's death. Initially hesitant, Charlie agrees. They decide to turn the boat into a torpedo of sorts and destroy the German gunboat, the Queen Louisa, which is effectively blocking British forces. It is at this point in the film that their respective journeys begin. As the uncouth Charlie and the prim and proper Rose first embark, they are essentially night and day in comparison to one another. Bogart and Hepburn both turn in career performances in their rendition of this odd couple. Rose's strong will and unrelenting attitude convinces, Charlie, who didn't want to get involved in the first place, thinking her plan was suicide. The two actors do a fantastic job of keeping the audience's attention, as it is just the two on screen for a large majority of the movie. As the pair travel down the river, they first gain a begrudging respect for one another. As they traverse and survive the dangerous Ulanga River, that respect slowly starts blossoming into love. While Charlie had been traveling that river for years, he never noticed the natural beauty until he found himself falling for Rose. The pair also grow as individuals, with Charlie becoming more mature and Rose shedding a little of her inhibition. John Huston does a wonderful crafting this story. He gets the best out of his actors and knows how to work with pace and timing. He does a great job of leading us down the path of their relationship without it feeling forced or campy, as happens in so many films today. He masterfully crafts a certain mood to the film; silly, dramatic, and high tension, all at appropriate moments. When the pair is trudging through the marsh, for example, you feel a real sense of doom and despair, as if they might not get out alive. This film just goes to show the incredible talents of the actors and director. Every moment felt genuine and authentic. This film certainly deserves its place in cinematic history as a classic. 8/10

    In central Africa, while War World 2 is affecting the world, a humble and simple boat captain and an elderly English missionary woman join forces, although reluctant with staying with one another, to travel on the captain's small boat (The African Queen) in order to sink a German ship, and to escape the woman's village of residence, raided by the Germans. In the small boat, the formalities and class differences become less and less obvious, until affection between the two protagonists explodes. Director John Huston, always eclectic in his choice of movies, puts in The African Queen big sparks of Romance and Light Comedy, Adventure, but also serious Drama, because of the dramatic background of the period depicted. One of those great Hollywood classics that shaped many modern films, because of it's original setting (Africa, too, was touched by the war, so the circumstances are very familiar) and situation of the characters, who slowly brake all bonds of formality. A bit rushed ending, with too much going on at once.

    In the 1950's,location shooting was a rarity,so the locale selected,everyone involved with this production knew it was going to be very hard work to get this film made.They just didn't know how tough until work began.I guess it helped to have one of the best directors of that day (not to mention in all of cinema history),John Huston,paired with two of the best actors to grace the screen,Humphrey Bogart and Kate Hepburn.The story is very captivating,and these cinema giants,working harder than usual under very adverse conditions,managed to come up with a winner.Definitely on the must see list for any classic cinema fan.

    As I write this The African Queen is sitting at a 9/10 rating on IMDb, with 86 percent giving it a 10/10. That makes it one of the most blatantly skewed ratings I have ever seen on IMDb, because this movie is awful. It is just plain bad. So it is clear to me that the studios have gotten pretty good at gaming the IMDb rating. I've noticed that ratings are often skewed pretty high on IMDb, and it has only gotten worse. But The African Queen takes the cake in terms of a dreadfully bad movie getting an impossibly high rating for what it is. Why is it bad? The script is like a work of fan fiction, and not in a good way. When you are seeing a movie for the first time and you are completing the actor's lines before they are, clearly it is lacking in any originality. There is zero tension. Even the decent actors in this movie deliver very poor performances. But I think they simply had nothing to work with. There is only so much an actor can do to salvage bad writing. And in this case, there was nothing they could do. And the special effects are very underwhelming. What kills me is that the boats in the Krakatoa, East of Java movie were much more impressive than the shippage in The African Queen, where they simply look like kind of plastic models flailing about in an old wash tub . I won't go on and on about how bad it is because it has already taken two hours of my life away. But suffice to say that this is an extremely uninspired film which I am sure Bogart will rank as one of his worst. And IMDb, the studio owned you on this one. This is nowhere near a 9/10, or even a 6 for that matter. Don't see it. Not even as a rental, or even on Blu Ray, HD, or whatever is next.

    I had caught the end of this film before but somehow had never watched it all the way through so when I saw it listed in the TV guide I had to watch it; now, having seen it, I can see why it is considered a classic. The film opens in 1914 in German East Africa, present day Tanzania, where an English missionary and his sister are taking a church service. They are interrupted by the steam boat 'African Queen' and her captain Charlie Allnut. He informs them of the war that has broken out in Europe and as such they are stranded in an enemy country. It isn't long before the Germans turn up and burn down the village; they leave the missionaries but the affect leaves the preacher a broken man and he soon dies. When Allnut returns he takes the sister, Rosie Sayer, aboard his boat and sets off down river. He suggests they find an island and sit the war out but she has other ideas... she wants to continue down river, past a German fort, over deadly rapids and on to the lake. This lake is patrolled by the German ship the Queen Louisa which is the only thing keeping British forces from attacking the German colony. She intends to take their small boat and sink the Louisa! I really enjoyed this film; Bogart was great as the gin-swilling steamer captain and Katherine Hepburn was equally good as the prim sister of the preacher; the two of them had a great on screen chemistry. Director John Huston did a fine job creating an exciting story; I was surprised just how good some of the special effects looked; it really looked like their small boat was being tossed around in the rapids even though a model was used... it helped of course that much of the movie was filmed on location in Africa; the scenery looked real because it was! While at heart the film is a romantic story between the two very different characters I couldn't help thinking about the film 'Apocalypse Now' as the boat went further and further along the river getting into various scrapes and approaching the deadly conclusion to its mission... this film is of course much lighter in tone! That isn't to say there isn't tension and more than once it looks as if the two protagonists are going to die before completing their self-given mission. If you want a good adventure that is suitable for all ages you could do a lot worse than this... I highly recommend it.

    When defending predictable, formulaic films, I often hear that "it's the road from A to B that matters". But when that road, as in The African Queen, in which A is Humphrey Bogart's ragged boatman and Katharine Hepburn's stern missionary not standing each other and B is them falling hopelessly in love, is not very interesting or entertaining, you have a problem. It's strange, everything I remembered about The African Queen was less pronounced now that I watched it again, for both better and worse. Firstly, the distance between A and B was a lot shorter  in the beginning, there was more of a slight annoyance or a stiff reservation than a downright hatred or dislike, and it didn't take very long before they fell into each other's arms. Secondly, Hepburn's character was a lot less annoying. I still don't think she (or Bogart) is very good, but I didn't exactly want her to die this time, and I guess their chemistry is all right. The romance was probably a bit less sappy, whereas the adventure and the finale were decidedly less riveting. One thing I did notice to a larger extent now was the pleasant Technicolor work, which is used to the greatest effect when there is a lot of nature on the screen, such as the opening scene where the camera sneaks through the jungle and enters the East African village of Kungdu. But other than that, The African Queen is still just a decent romantic adventure that I don't quite get the praise for.

    The African Queen is a fantastically told story of a gin-swilling riverboat captain and an uptight Methodist missionary. When the movie begins, we are told that the First World War is about to begin. Two Methodist missionaries, a brother and sister, are forced to deal with the German forces that invade the village at which they teach, as it is a British colony. The confrontation ends up killing the brother, leaving his sister, Rose, played marvelously by the always enjoyable Katharine Hepburn, to fend for herself. She takes in with a riverboat captain, played by the immensely talented Humphrey Bogart, named Charlie, who captains the smallish steamship, the African Queen. Their journey takes them down the Ulanga River in Africa. At the beginning of their journey, Rose devises a plan to retaliate against the Germans, for her country, and also to avenge her brother's death. Initially hesitant, Charlie agrees. They decide to turn the boat into a torpedo of sorts and destroy the German gunboat, the Queen Louisa, which is effectively blocking British forces. It is at this point in the film that their respective journeys begin. As the uncouth Charlie and the prim and proper Rose first embark, they are essentially night and day in comparison to one another. Bogart and Hepburn both turn in career performances in their rendition of this odd couple. Rose's strong will and unrelenting attitude convinces, Charlie, who didn't want to get involved in the first place, thinking her plan was suicide. The two actors do a fantastic job of keeping the audience's attention, as it is just the two on screen for a large majority of the movie. As the pair travel down the river, they first gain a begrudging respect for one another. As they traverse and survive the dangerous Ulanga River, that respect slowly starts blossoming into love. While Charlie had been traveling that river for years, he never noticed the natural beauty until he found himself falling for Rose. The pair also grow as individuals, with Charlie becoming more mature and Rose shedding a little of her inhibition. John Huston does a wonderful crafting this story. He gets the best out of his actors and knows how to work with pace and timing. He does a great job of leading us down the path of their relationship without it feeling forced or campy, as happens in so many films today. He masterfully crafts a certain mood to the film; silly, dramatic, and high tension, all at appropriate moments. When the pair is trudging through the marsh, for example, you feel a real sense of doom and despair, as if they might not get out alive. This film just goes to show the incredible talents of the actors and director. Every moment felt genuine and authentic. This film certainly deserves its place in cinematic history as a classic. 8/10

    Charlie Allnut is a rascal. He is also a boat captain in Africa, who ferries things up and down the river in 1914. One day he stops at a missionary, where prim Rose Sayer is preaching along with her brother. Charlie has tea with them, but to say they get along is an overstatement. Charlie leaves, but not before telling the English Rose and her brother that Germany has declared war. Soon after he leaves, the camp is taken over by Germans, who burn the huts down and leave Rose and her brother to fend for them selves. Her brother catches the fever, and dies. It is then that Charlie comes back. He helps Rose bury her brother, and then asks her along to wait out the war in the jungle. Soon after, they find a place to hide, when Rose begins to look at a map. She asks Charlie why they can't go up the river, and he tells her that there are rapids, a German fort, waterfalls, and at the end, a big German steamer, patrolling the lake so the British can't move down. Noticing Charlie has a lot of explosives, that he was carrying for the mine, Rose asks if they can't ride to the lake, and then blow up the German steamer. Charlie says no, but Rose persists, and you can see where this is going. I know it sounds dark, but it is really anything but. There is one thing that can impede you from enjoying The African Queen: cynicism. You cannot look at this film from a cynical point of view. You'll hate it. That said, you can going into it being cynical, but you have to drop it after five minutes. Okay, got it? Good, we can move on. Three films have been called Huston's best: The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of The Sierra Madre and The African Queen. At least, from what I've heard. I did not like The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre, and as I have not reviewed The Maltese Falcon, I'll hold judgment until then. So what is Huston's best film? The African Queen, from what I've seen. Many people have tried to describe the essence of this film. Is it Bogart, Hepburn or Huston? Is it the shooting on location? Or maybe the story? I cannot pinpoint the film's greatness. It is like a cozy den, that once you've entered, you never want to leave. The only other film I've had such a reaction to is Casablanca. It is a great film, but why? The performances by Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn are certainly part of that magic.You only have to see them on screen for a second, and you are instantly with them. Bogart plays the kind of character only Bogart could play, and likewise with Hepburn. They inhabit their characters with an energy that cannot be defined. You do not think of them as Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, but as Rose Sayer and Charlie Allnut. The characters are that memorable. It is the kind of love story that feels alive and fresh, despite how in a different film it would seem clich&eacute;d. Here it embraces the clich&eacute;, and is better because of it. The development feels like a natural extension of the plot. Speaking of plot, the screenplay by James Agee and John Huston achieves that perfect balance of giving you a plot that keeps you interested, and two leads you cannot help but love. Agee had a heart attack before he could finish the screenplay, so Huston brought it down to Africa to finish it. He brought Peter Viertel to work on it with him, and sometimes they would write the next scene the day before it was shot. Shooting on an actual river in Africa must have presented a massive challenge for the cinematographer, but he succeeded admirably. The film is neither a walking travel ad, but it doesn't forget about it's landscape either. Perhaps the only weak link is the score, but even that can not impede the film from greatness. This brings me to Huston's direction. He has often been accused of his films looking staged, with no amazing cinematic tricks employed. I cannot defend him, but I can say this. Huston is a director. He is not an actor's director, a cinematographer's director, or a screenwriters director. He is truly a director, he oversees all aspects of production with the same wise gaze. He is not an auteur. He trusts the people he works with to do a good job, and just oversees them doing it. This kind of film making is the only kind that would work for The African Queen. And it does, Huston delivers yet another beautiful adventure film. If you are feeling low, this is the kind of film that can make you feel better. When I gave The Dead ten stars, it took me a while to make the decision. Here it took me a second. The African Queen is an indisputable masterpiece, for now and for always. The African Queen, 1951, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn and Robert Morely, Directed by John Huston, 10/10 (A+) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

    always put off watching this movie as the combination of Bogart and Hepburn didn't interest me. decided to watch it to night as there was nothing else on the screen. well...i loved the film and i was completely entranced by Mr. Bogart. too see him smile....at last and his drunk scenes were absolutely on track. sure the story line is a bit...exaggerated but it still is a poignant movie. Katherine Hepburn another one who never captured my heart is quite good in this one. she has an ability to feed the other actors right on with her replies and reactions. now I'm glad I've watched it and recommend it to all people who like good acting and a movie that has thrills....sentimentality....and humour.

    Just like brandy, The African Queen gets better with age. Humphrey Bogart (Charlie Allnut) won a best actor Academy award for his great performance. He beat Marlon Brando (A Streetcar Named Desire)....and that was a correct decision. Early in his career Bogey was mostly a bootlegger, then came his period of playing "private Dicks". Few people knew he could REALLY act. Then in the Treasure of Sierra Madre and this great movie, he showed what he could do. Katherine Hepburn was at least as good as Meryl Streep....and in this wonderful film she once again shows her class. The African Queen is about ..the strangeness of love..how little boats can do Titanical things..and that entertainment is (and always will be) the reason we visit cinemas. Having a good script is so important to any movie .. Bogey and Kate deliver there lines with aplomb. There is a lot of fun in The African Queen, and this 1951 film delivers at all levels. John Huston (a close friend of Bogey) directs probably his best movie. Bogey did not like working on location, but thankfully Huston advised him that there would be enough booze for the whole shoot..!!

    Recently I watched The African Queen and at first I had my doubts; but after finishing the film it was awesome. A timeless movies that cannot be remade or re-casted as Bogart and Hepburn at their best. Something that will be remembered as one of the moments to be modelled for todays cinematic experience. The movie is based on a novel written by C.S forester about 2 couples played by Hepburn and Bogart going through outrageous circumstances against the Germans. But more importantly it is about the spectacular chemistry between Hepburn and Bogart going through the times of the German war time era. A film where the Technicolour vision makes the movie come alive. Overall I would highly recommend this movie if you ever get the chance. A rare gem that beenfound to shine through the years for a fresh look at an phenomenal casting, directing and location.

She asks Charlie why they can't go up the river, and he tells her that there are rapids, a German fort, waterfalls, and at the end, a big German steamer, patrolling the lake so the British can't move down. Noticing Charlie has a lot of explosives, that he was carrying for the mine, Rose asks if they can't ride to the lake, and then blow up the German steamer. Charlie says no, but Rose persists, and you can see where this is going. I know it sounds dark, but it is really anything but. There is one thing that can impede you from enjoying The African Queen: cynicism. You cannot look at this film from a cynical point of view. You'll hate it. That said, you can going into it being cynical, but you have to drop it after five minutes. Okay, got it? Good, we can move on. Three films have been called Huston's best: The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of The Sierra Madre and The African Queen. At least, from what I've heard. I did not like The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre, and as I have not reviewed The Maltese Falcon, I'll hold judgment until then. So what is Huston's best film? The African Queen, from what I've seen. Many people have tried to describe the essence of this film. Is it Bogart, Hepburn or Huston? Is it the shooting on location? Or maybe the story? I cannot pinpoint the film's greatness. It is like a cozy den, that once you've entered, you never want to leave. The only other film I've had such a reaction to is Casablanca. It is a great film, but why? The performances by Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn are certainly part of that magic.You only have to see them on screen for a second, and you are instantly with them. Bogart plays the kind of character only Bogart could play, and likewise with Hepburn. They inhabit their characters with an energy that cannot be defined. You do not think of them as Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, but as Rose Sayer and Charlie Allnut. The characters are that memorable. It is the kind of love story that feels alive and fresh, despite how in a different film it would seem clich&eacute;d. Here it embraces the clich&eacute;, and is better because of it. The development feels like a natural extension of the plot. Speaking of plot, the screenplay by James Agee and John Huston achieves that perfect balance of giving you a plot that keeps you interested, and two leads you cannot help but love. Agee had a heart attack before he could finish the screenplay, so Huston brought it down to Africa to finish it. He brought Peter Viertel to work on it with him, and sometimes they would write the next scene the day before it was shot. Shooting on an actual river in Africa must have presented a massive challenge for the cinematographer, but he succeeded admirably. The film is neither a walking travel ad, but it doesn't forget about it's landscape either. Perhaps the only weak link is the score, but even that can not impede the film from greatness. This brings me to Huston's direction. He has often been accused of his films looking staged, with no amazing cinematic tricks employed. I cannot defend him, but I can say this. Huston is a director. He is not an actor's director, a cinematographer's director, or a screenwriters director. He is truly a director, he oversees all aspects of production with the same wise gaze. He is not an auteur. He trusts the people he works with to do a good job, and just oversees them doing it. This kind of film making is the only kind that would work for The African Queen. And it does, Huston delivers yet another beautiful adventure film. If you are feeling low, this is the kind of film that can make you feel better. When I gave The Dead ten stars, it took me a while to make the decision. Here it took me a second. The African Queen is an indisputable masterpiece, for now and for always. The African Queen, 1951, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn and Robert Morely, Directed by John Huston, 10/10 (A+) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

    always put off watching this movie as the combination of Bogart and Hepburn didn't interest me. decided to watch it to night as there was nothing else on the screen. well...i loved the film and i was completely entranced by Mr. Bogart. too see him smile....at last and his drunk scenes were absolutely on track. sure the story line is a bit...exaggerated but it still is a poignant movie. Katherine Hepburn another one who never captured my heart is quite good in this one. she has an ability to feed the other actors right on with her replies and reactions. now I'm glad I've watched it and recommend it to all people who like good acting and a movie that has thrills....sentimentality....and humour.

    Just like brandy, The African Queen gets better with age. Humphrey Bogart (Charlie Allnut) won a best actor Academy award for his great performance. He beat Marlon Brando (A Streetcar Named Desire)....and that was a correct decision. Early in his career Bogey was mostly a bootlegger, then came his period of playing "private Dicks". Few people knew he could REALLY act. Then in the Treasure of Sierra Madre and this great movie, he showed what he could do. Katherine Hepburn was at least as good as Meryl Streep....and in this wonderful film she once again shows her class. The African Queen is about ..the strangeness of love..how little boats can do Titanical things..and that entertainment is (and always will be) the reason we visit cinemas. Having a good script is so important to any movie .. Bogey and Kate deliver there lines with aplomb. There is a lot of fun in The African Queen, and this 1951 film delivers at all levels. John Huston (a close friend of Bogey) directs probably his best movie. Bogey did not like working on location, but thankfully Huston advised him that there would be enough booze for the whole shoot..!!

    Recently I watched The African Queen and at first I had my doubts; but after finishing the film it was awesome. A timeless movies that cannot be remade or re-casted as Bogart and Hepburn at their best. Something that will be remembered as one of the moments to be modelled for todays cinematic experience. The movie is based on a novel written by C.S forester about 2 couples played by Hepburn and Bogart going through outrageous circumstances against the Germans. But more importantly it is about the spectacular chemistry between Hepburn and Bogart going through the times of the German war time era. A film where the Technicolour vision makes the movie come alive. Overall I would highly recommend this movie if you ever get the chance. A rare gem that beenfound to shine through the years for a fresh look at an phenomenal casting, directing and location.

    In central Africa, while War World 2 is affecting the world, a humble and simple boat captain and an elderly English missionary woman join forces, although reluctant with staying with one another, to travel on the captain's small boat (The African Queen) in order to sink a German ship, and to escape the woman's village of residence, raided by the Germans. In the small boat, the formalities and class differences become less and less obvious, until affection between the two protagonists explodes. Director John Huston, always eclectic in his choice of movies, puts in The African Queen big sparks of Romance and Light Comedy, Adventure, but also serious Drama, because of the dramatic background of the period depicted. One of those great Hollywood classics that shaped many modern films, because of it's original setting (Africa, too, was touched by the war, so the circumstances are very familiar) and situation of the characters, who slowly brake all bonds of formality. A bit rushed ending, with too much going on at once.

    In the 1950's,location shooting was a rarity,so the locale selected,everyone involved with this production knew it was going to be very hard work to get this film made.They just didn't know how tough until work began.I guess it helped to have one of the best directors of that day (not to mention in all of cinema history),John Huston,paired with two of the best actors to grace the screen,Humphrey Bogart and Kate Hepburn.The story is very captivating,and these cinema giants,working harder than usual under very adverse conditions,managed to come up with a winner.Definitely on the must see list for any classic cinema fan.

    As I write this The African Queen is sitting at a 9/10 rating on IMDb, with 86 percent giving it a 10/10. That makes it one of the most blatantly skewed ratings I have ever seen on IMDb, because this movie is awful. It is just plain bad. So it is clear to me that the studios have gotten pretty good at gaming the IMDb rating. I've noticed that ratings are often skewed pretty high on IMDb, and it has only gotten worse. But The African Queen takes the cake in terms of a dreadfully bad movie getting an impossibly high rating for what it is. Why is it bad? The script is like a work of fan fiction, and not in a good way. When you are seeing a movie for the first time and you are completing the actor's lines before they are, clearly it is lacking in any originality. There is zero tension. Even the decent actors in this movie deliver very poor performances. But I think they simply had nothing to work with. There is only so much an actor can do to salvage bad writing. And in this case, there was nothing they could do. And the special effects are very underwhelming. What kills me is that the boats in the Krakatoa, East of Java movie were much more impressive than the shippage in The African Queen, where they simply look like kind of plastic models flailing about in an old wash tub . I won't go on and on about how bad it is because it has already taken two hours of my life away. But suffice to say that this is an extremely uninspired film which I am sure Bogart will rank as one of his worst. And IMDb, the studio owned you on this one. This is nowhere near a 9/10, or even a 6 for that matter. Don't see it. Not even as a rental, or even on Blu Ray, HD, or whatever is next.

    I had caught the end of this film before but somehow had never watched it all the way through so when I saw it listed in the TV guide I had to watch it; now, having seen it, I can see why it is considered a classic. The film opens in 1914 in German East Africa, present day Tanzania, where an English missionary and his sister are taking a church service. They are interrupted by the steam boat 'African Queen' and her captain Charlie Allnut. He informs them of the war that has broken out in Europe and as such they are stranded in an enemy country. It isn't long before the Germans turn up and burn down the village; they leave the missionaries but the affect leaves the preacher a broken man and he soon dies. When Allnut returns he takes the sister, Rosie Sayer, aboard his boat and sets off down river. He suggests they find an island and sit the war out but she has other ideas... she wants to continue down river, past a German fort, over deadly rapids and on to the lake. This lake is patrolled by the German ship the Queen Louisa which is the only thing keeping British forces from attacking the German colony. She intends to take their small boat and sink the Louisa! I really enjoyed this film; Bogart was great as the gin-swilling steamer captain and Katherine Hepburn was equally good as the prim sister of the preacher; the two of them had a great on screen chemistry. Director John Huston did a fine job creating an exciting story; I was surprised just how good some of the special effects looked; it really looked like their small boat was being tossed around in the rapids even though a model was used... it helped of course that much of the movie was filmed on location in Africa; the scenery looked real because it was! While at heart the film is a romantic story between the two very different characters I couldn't help thinking about the film 'Apocalypse Now' as the boat went further and further along the river getting into various scrapes and approaching the deadly conclusion to its mission... this film is of course much lighter in tone! That isn't to say there isn't tension and more than once it looks as if the two protagonists are going to die before completing their self-given mission. If you want a good adventure that is suitable for all ages you could do a lot worse than this... I highly recommend it.

    When defending predictable, formulaic films, I often hear that "it's the road from A to B that matters". But when that road, as in The African Queen, in which A is Humphrey Bogart's ragged boatman and Katharine Hepburn's stern missionary not standing each other and B is them falling hopelessly in love, is not very interesting or entertaining, you have a problem. It's strange, everything I remembered about The African Queen was less pronounced now that I watched it again, for both better and worse. Firstly, the distance between A and B was a lot shorter  in the beginning, there was more of a slight annoyance or a stiff reservation than a downright hatred or dislike, and it didn't take very long before they fell into each other's arms. Secondly, Hepburn's character was a lot less annoying. I still don't think she (or Bogart) is very good, but I didn't exactly want her to die this time, and I guess their chemistry is all right. The romance was probably a bit less sappy, whereas the adventure and the finale were decidedly less riveting. One thing I did notice to a larger extent now was the pleasant Technicolor work, which is used to the greatest effect when there is a lot of nature on the screen, such as the opening scene where the camera sneaks through the jungle and enters the East African village of Kungdu. But other than that, The African Queen is still just a decent romantic adventure that I don't quite get the praise for.

    The African Queen is a fantastically told story of a gin-swilling riverboat captain and an uptight Methodist missionary. When the movie begins, we are told that the First World War is about to begin. Two Methodist missionaries, a brother and sister, are forced to deal with the German forces that invade the village at which they teach, as it is a British colony. The confrontation ends up killing the brother, leaving his sister, Rose, played marvelously by the always enjoyable Katharine Hepburn, to fend for herself. She takes in with a riverboat captain, played by the immensely talented Humphrey Bogart, named Charlie, who captains the smallish steamship, the African Queen. Their journey takes them down the Ulanga River in Africa. At the beginning of their journey, Rose devises a plan to retaliate against the Germans, for her country, and also to avenge her brother's death. Initially hesitant, Charlie agrees. They decide to turn the boat into a torpedo of sorts and destroy the German gunboat, the Queen Louisa, which is effectively blocking British forces. It is at this point in the film that their respective journeys begin. As the uncouth Charlie and the prim and proper Rose first embark, they are essentially night and day in comparison to one another. Bogart and Hepburn both turn in career performances in their rendition of this odd couple. Rose's strong will and unrelenting attitude convinces, Charlie, who didn't want to get involved in the first place, thinking her plan was suicide. The two actors do a fantastic job of keeping the audience's attention, as it is just the two on screen for a large majority of the movie. As the pair travel down the river, they first gain a begrudging respect for one another. As they traverse and survive the dangerous Ulanga River, that respect slowly starts blossoming into love. While Charlie had been traveling that river for years, he never noticed the natural beauty until he found himself falling for Rose. The pair also grow as individuals, with Charlie becoming more mature and Rose shedding a little of her inhibition. John Huston does a wonderful crafting this story. He gets the best out of his actors and knows how to work with pace and timing. He does a great job of leading us down the path of their relationship without it feeling forced or campy, as happens in so many films today. He masterfully crafts a certain mood to the film; silly, dramatic, and high tension, all at appropriate moments. When the pair is trudging through the marsh, for example, you feel a real sense of doom and despair, as if they might not get out alive. This film just goes to show the incredible talents of the actors and director. Every moment felt genuine and authentic. This film certainly deserves its place in cinematic history as a classic. 8/10

    Charlie Allnut is a rascal. He is also a boat captain in Africa, who ferries things up and down the river in 1914. One day he stops at a missionary, where prim Rose Sayer is preaching along with her brother. Charlie has tea with them, but to say they get along is an overstatement. Charlie leaves, but not before telling the English Rose and her brother that Germany has declared war. Soon after he leaves, the camp is taken over by Germans, who burn the huts down and leave Rose and her brother to fend for them selves. Her brother catches the fever, and dies. It is then that Charlie comes back. He helps Rose bury her brother, and then asks her along to wait out the war in the jungle. Soon after, they find a place to hide, when Rose begins to look at a map. She asks Charlie why they can't go up the river, and he tells her that there are rapids, a German fort, waterfalls, and at the end, a big German steamer, patrolling the lake so the British can't move down. Noticing Charlie has a lot of explosives, that he was carrying for the mine, Rose asks if they can't ride to the lake, and then blow up the German steamer. Charlie says no, but Rose persists, and you can see where this is going. I know it sounds dark, but it is really anything but. There is one thing that can impede you from enjoying The African Queen: cynicism. You cannot look at this film from a cynical point of view. You'll hate it. That said, you can going into it being cynical, but you have to drop it after five minutes. Okay, got it? Good, we can move on.

    I had caught the end of this film before but somehow had never watched it all the way through so when I saw it listed in the TV guide I had to watch it; now, having seen it, I can see why it is considered a classic. The film opens in 1914 in German East Africa, present day Tanzania, where an English missionary and his sister are taking a church service. They are interrupted by the steam boat 'African Queen' and her captain Charlie Allnut. He informs them of the war that has broken out in Europe and as such they are stranded in an enemy country. It isn't long before the Germans turn up and burn down the village; they leave the missionaries but the affect leaves the preacher a broken man and he soon dies. When Allnut returns he takes the sister, Rosie Sayer, aboard his boat and sets off down river. He suggests they find an island and sit the war out but she has other ideas... she wants to continue down river, past a German fort, over deadly rapids and on to the lake. This lake is patrolled by the German ship the Queen Louisa which is the only thing keeping British forces from attacking the German colony. She intends to take their small boat and sink the Louisa! I really enjoyed this film; Bogart was great as the gin-swilling steamer captain and Katherine Hepburn was equally good as the prim sister of the preacher; the two of them had a great on screen chemistry. Director John Huston did a fine job creating an exciting story; I was surprised just how good some of the special effects looked; it really looked like their small boat was being tossed around in the rapids even though a model was used... it helped of course that much of the movie was filmed on location in Africa; the scenery looked real because it was! While at heart the film is a romantic story between the two very different characters I couldn't help thinking about the film 'Apocalypse Now' as the boat went further and further along the river getting into various scrapes and approaching the deadly conclusion to its mission... this film is of course much lighter in tone! That isn't to say there isn't tension and more than once it looks as if the two protagonists are going to die before completing their self-given mission. If you want a good adventure that is suitable for all ages you could do a lot worse than this... I highly recommend it.

    When defending predictable, formulaic films, I often hear that "it's the road from A to B that matters". But when that road, as in The African Queen, in which A is Humphrey Bogart's ragged boatman and Katharine Hepburn's stern missionary not standing each other and B is them falling hopelessly in love, is not very interesting or entertaining, you have a problem. It's strange, everything I remembered about The African Queen was less pronounced now that I watched it again, for both better and worse. Firstly, the distance between A and B was a lot shorter  in the beginning, there was more of a slight annoyance or a stiff reservation than a downright hatred or dislike, and it didn't take very long before they fell into each other's arms. Secondly, Hepburn's character was a lot less annoying. I still don't think she (or Bogart) is very good, but I didn't exactly want her to die this time, and I guess their chemistry is all right. The romance was probably a bit less sappy, whereas the adventure and the finale were decidedly less riveting. One thing I did notice to a larger extent now was the pleasant Technicolor work, which is used to the greatest effect when there is a lot of nature on the screen, such as the opening scene where the camera sneaks through the jungle and enters the East African village of Kungdu. But other than that, The African Queen is still just a decent romantic adventure that I don't quite get the praise for.

    The African Queen is a fantastically told story of a gin-swilling riverboat captain and an uptight Methodist missionary. When the movie begins, we are told that the First World War is about to begin. Two Methodist missionaries, a brother and sister, are forced to deal with the German forces that invade the village at which they teach, as it is a British colony. The confrontation ends up killing the brother, leaving his sister, Rose, played marvelously by the always enjoyable Katharine Hepburn, to fend for herself. She takes in with a riverboat captain, played by the immensely talented Humphrey Bogart, named Charlie, who captains the smallish steamship, the African Queen. Their journey takes them down the Ulanga River in Africa. At the beginning of their journey, Rose devises a plan to retaliate against the Germans, for her country, and also to avenge her brother's death. Initially hesitant, Charlie agrees. They decide to turn the boat into a torpedo of sorts and destroy the German gunboat, the Queen Louisa, which is effectively blocking British forces. It is at this point in the film that their respective journeys begin. As the uncouth Charlie and the prim and proper Rose first embark, they are essentially night and day in comparison to one another. Bogart and Hepburn both turn in career performances in their rendition of this odd couple. Rose's strong will and unrelenting attitude convinces, Charlie, who didn't want to get involved in the first place, thinking her plan was suicide. The two actors do a fantastic job of keeping the audience's attention, as it is just the two on screen for a large majority of the movie. As the pair travel down the river, they first gain a begrudging respect for one another. As they traverse and survive the dangerous Ulanga River, that respect slowly starts blossoming into love. While Charlie had been traveling that river for years, he never noticed the natural beauty until he found himself falling for Rose. The pair also grow as individuals, with Charlie becoming more mature and Rose shedding a little of her inhibition. John Huston does a wonderful crafting this story. He gets the best out of his actors and knows how to work with pace and timing. He does a great job of leading us down the path of their relationship without it feeling forced or campy, as happens in so many films today. He masterfully crafts a certain mood to the film; silly, dramatic, and high tension, all at appropriate moments. When the pair is trudging through the marsh, for example, you feel a real sense of doom and despair, as if they might not get out alive. This film just goes to show the incredible talents of the actors and director. Every moment felt genuine and authentic. This film certainly deserves its place in cinematic history as a classic. 8/10

    Charlie Allnut is a rascal. He is also a boat captain in Africa, who ferries things up and down the river in 1914. One day he stops at a missionary, where prim Rose Sayer is preaching along with her brother. Charlie has tea with them, but to say they get along is an overstatement. Charlie leaves, but not before telling the English Rose and her brother that Germany has declared war. Soon after he leaves, the camp is taken over by Germans, who burn the huts down and leave Rose and her brother to fend for them selves. Her brother catches the fever, and dies. It is then that Charlie comes back. He helps Rose bury her brother, and then asks her along to wait out the war in the jungle. Soon after, they find a place to hide, when Rose begins to look at a map. She asks Charlie why they can't go up the river, and he tells her that there are rapids, a German fort, waterfalls, and at the end, a big German steamer, patrolling the lake so the British can't move down. Noticing Charlie has a lot of explosives, that he was carrying for the mine, Rose asks if they can't ride to the lake, and then blow up the German steamer. Charlie says no, but Rose persists, and you can see where this is going. I know it sounds dark, but it is really anything but. There is one thing that can impede you from enjoying The African Queen: cynicism. You cannot look at this film from a cynical point of view. You'll hate it. That said, you can going into it being cynical, but you have to drop it after five minutes. Okay, got it? Good, we can move on. Three films have been called Huston's best: The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of The Sierra Madre and The African Queen. At least, from what I've heard. I did not like The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre, and as I have not reviewed The Maltese Falcon, I'll hold judgment until then. So what is Huston's best film? The African Queen, from what I've seen. Many people have tried to describe the essence of this film. Is it Bogart, Hepburn or Huston? Is it the shooting on location? Or maybe the story? I cannot pinpoint the film's greatness. It is like a cozy den, that once you've entered, you never want to leave. The only other film I've had such a reaction to is Casablanca. It is a great film, but why? The performances by Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn are certainly part of that magic.You only have to see them on screen for a second, and you are instantly with them. Bogart plays the kind of character only Bogart could play, and likewise with Hepburn. They inhabit their characters with an energy that cannot be defined. You do not think of them as Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, but as Rose Sayer and Charlie Allnut. The characters are that memorable. It is the kind of love story that feels alive and fresh, despite how in a different film it would seem clich&eacute;d. Here it embraces the clich&eacute;, and is better because of it. The development feels like a natural extension of the plot. Speaking of plot, the screenplay by James Agee and John Huston achieves that perfect balance of giving you a plot that keeps you interested, and two leads you cannot help but love. Agee had a heart attack before he could finish the screenplay, so Huston brought it down to Africa to finish it. He brought Peter Viertel to work on it with him, and sometimes they would write the next scene the day before it was shot. Shooting on an actual river in Africa must have presented a massive challenge for the cinematographer, but he succeeded admirably. The film is neither a walking travel ad, but it doesn't forget about it's landscape either. Perhaps the only weak link is the score, but even that can not impede the film from greatness. This brings me to Huston's direction. He has often been accused of his films looking staged, with no amazing cinematic tricks employed. I cannot defend him, but I can say this. Huston is a director. He is not an actor's director, a cinematographer's director, or a screenwriters director. He is truly a director, he oversees all aspects of production with the same wise gaze. He is not an auteur. He trusts the people he works with to do a good job, and just oversees them doing it. This kind of film making is the only kind that would work for The African Queen. And it does, Huston delivers yet another beautiful adventure film. If you are feeling low, this is the kind of film that can make you feel better. When I gave The Dead ten stars, it took me a while to make the decision. Here it took me a second. The African Queen is an indisputable masterpiece, for now and for always. The African Queen, 1951, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn and Robert Morely, Directed by John Huston, 10/10 (A+) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

    always put off watching this movie as the combination of Bogart and Hepburn didn't interest me. decided to watch it to night as there was nothing else on the screen. well...i loved the film and i was completely entranced by Mr. Bogart. too see him smile....at last and his drunk scenes were absolutely on track. sure the story line is a bit...exaggerated but it still is a poignant movie. Katherine Hepburn another one who never captured my heart is quite good in this one. she has an ability to feed the other actors right on with her replies and reactions. now I'm glad I've watched it and recommend it to all people who like good acting and a movie that has thrills....sentimentality....and humour.

    Just like brandy, The African Queen gets better with age. Humphrey Bogart (Charlie Allnut) won a best actor Academy award for his great performance. He beat Marlon Brando (A Streetcar Named Desire)....and that was a correct decision. Early in his career Bogey was mostly a bootlegger, then came his period of playing "private Dicks". Few people knew he could REALLY act. Then in the Treasure of Sierra Madre and this great movie, he showed what he could do. Katherine Hepburn was at least as good as Meryl Streep....and in this wonderful film she once again shows her class. The African Queen is about ..the strangeness of love..how little boats can do Titanical things..and that entertainment is (and always will be) the reason we visit cinemas. Having a good script is so important to any movie .. Bogey and Kate deliver there lines with aplomb. There is a lot of fun in The African Queen, and this 1951 film delivers at all levels. John Huston (a close friend of Bogey) directs probably his best movie. Bogey did not like working on location, but thankfully Huston advised him that there would be enough booze for the whole shoot..!!

    Recently I watched The African Queen and at first I had my doubts; but after finishing the film it was awesome. A timeless movies that cannot be remade or re-casted as Bogart and Hepburn at their best. Something that will be remembered as one of the moments to be modelled for todays cinematic experience. The movie is based on a novel written by C.S forester about 2 couples played by Hepburn and Bogart going through outrageous circumstances against the Germans. But more importantly it is about the spectacular chemistry between Hepburn and Bogart going through the times of the German war time era. A film where the Technicolour vision makes the movie come alive. Overall I would highly recommend this movie if you ever get the chance. A rare gem that beenfound to shine through the years for a fresh look at an phenomenal casting, directing and location.

    In central Africa, while War World 2 is affecting the world, a humble and simple boat captain and an elderly English missionary woman join forces, although reluctant with staying with one another, to travel on the captain's small boat (The African Queen) in order to sink a German ship, and to escape the woman's village of residence, raided by the Germans. In the small boat, the formalities and class differences become less and less obvious, until affection between the two protagonists explodes. Director John Huston, always eclectic in his choice of movies, puts in The African Queen big sparks of Romance and Light Comedy, Adventure, but also serious Drama, because of the dramatic background of the period depicted. One of those great Hollywood classics that shaped many modern films, because of it's original setting (Africa, too, was touched by the war, so the circumstances are very familiar) and situation of the characters, who slowly brake all bonds of formality. A bit rushed ending, with too much going on at once.

    In the 1950's,location shooting was a rarity,so the locale selected,everyone involved with this production knew it was going to be very hard work to get this film made.They just didn't know how tough until work began.I guess it helped to have one of the best directors of that day (not to mention in all of cinema history),John Huston,paired with two of the best actors to grace the screen,Humphrey Bogart and Kate Hepburn.The story is very captivating,and these cinema giants,working harder than usual under very adverse conditions,managed to come up with a winner.Definitely on the must see list for any classic cinema fan.

    As I write this The African Queen is sitting at a 9/10 rating on IMDb, with 86 percent giving it a 10/10. That makes it one of the most blatantly skewed ratings I have ever seen on IMDb, because this movie is awful. It is just plain bad. So it is clear to me that the studios have gotten pretty good at gaming the IMDb rating. I've noticed that ratings are often skewed pretty high on IMDb, and it has only gotten worse. But The African Queen takes the cake in terms of a dreadfully bad movie getting an impossibly high rating for what it is. Why is it bad? The script is like a work of fan fiction, and not in a good way. When you are seeing a movie for the first time and you are completing the actor's lines before they are, clearly it is lacking in any originality. There is zero tension. Even the decent actors in this movie deliver very poor performances. But I think they simply had nothing to work with. There is only so much an actor can do to salvage bad writing. And in this case, there was nothing they could do. And the special effects are very underwhelming. What kills me is that the boats in the Krakatoa, East of Java movie were much more impressive than the shippage in The African Queen, where they simply look like kind of plastic models flailing about in an old wash tub . I won't go on and on about how bad it is because it has already taken two hours of my life away. But suffice to say that this is an extremely uninspired film which I am sure Bogart will rank as one of his worst. And IMDb, the studio owned you on this one. This is nowhere near a 9/10, or even a 6 for that matter. Don't see it. Not even as a rental, or even on Blu Ray, HD, or whatever is next.

    always put off watching this movie as the combination of Bogart and Hepburn didn't interest me. decided to watch it to night as there was nothing else on the screen. well...i loved the film and i was completely entranced by Mr. Bogart. too see him smile....at last and his drunk scenes were absolutely on track. sure the story line is a bit...exaggerated but it still is a poignant movie. Katherine Hepburn another one who never captured my heart is quite good in this one. she has an ability to feed the other actors right on with her replies and reactions. now I'm glad I've watched it and recommend it to all people who like good acting and a movie that has thrills....sentimentality....and humour.

    Just like brandy, The African Queen gets better with age. Humphrey Bogart (Charlie Allnut) won a best actor Academy award for his great performance. He beat Marlon Brando (A Streetcar Named Desire)....and that was a correct decision. Early in his career Bogey was mostly a bootlegger, then came his period of playing "private Dicks". Few people knew he could REALLY act. Then in the Treasure of Sierra Madre and this great movie, he showed what he could do. Katherine Hepburn was at least as good as Meryl Streep....and in this wonderful film she once again shows her class. The African Queen is about ..the strangeness of love..how little boats can do Titanical things..and that entertainment is (and always will be) the reason we visit cinemas. Having a good script is so important to any movie .. Bogey and Kate deliver there lines with aplomb. There is a lot of fun in The African Queen, and this 1951 film delivers at all levels. John Huston (a close friend of Bogey) directs probably his best movie. Bogey did not like working on location, but thankfully Huston advised him that there would be enough booze for the whole shoot..!!

    Recently I watched The African Queen and at first I had my doubts; but after finishing the film it was awesome. A timeless movies that cannot be remade or re-casted as Bogart and Hepburn at their best. Something that will be remembered as one of the moments to be modelled for todays cinematic experience. The movie is based on a novel written by C.S forester about 2 couples played by Hepburn and Bogart going through outrageous circumstances against the Germans. But more importantly it is about the spectacular chemistry between Hepburn and Bogart going through the times of the German war time era. A film where the Technicolour vision makes the movie come alive. Overall I would highly recommend this movie if you ever get the chance. A rare gem that beenfound to shine through the years for a fresh look at an phenomenal casting, directing and location.

    In central Africa, while War World 2 is affecting the world, a humble and simple boat captain and an elderly English missionary woman join forces, although reluctant with staying with one another, to travel on the captain's small boat (The African Queen) in order to sink a German ship, and to escape the woman's village of residence, raided by the Germans. In the small boat, the formalities and class differences become less and less obvious, until affection between the two protagonists explodes. Director John Huston, always eclectic in his choice of movies, puts in The African Queen big sparks of Romance and Light Comedy, Adventure, but also serious Drama, because of the dramatic background of the period depicted. One of those great Hollywood classics that shaped many modern films, because of it's original setting (Africa, too, was touched by the war, so the circumstances are very familiar) and situation of the characters, who slowly brake all bonds of formality. A bit rushed ending, with too much going on at once.

    In the 1950's,location shooting was a rarity,so the locale selected,everyone involved with this production knew it was going to be very hard work to get this film made.They just didn't know how tough until work began.I guess it helped to have one of the best directors of that day (not to mention in all of cinema history),John Huston,paired with two of the best actors to grace the screen,Humphrey Bogart and Kate Hepburn.The story is very captivating,and these cinema giants,working harder than usual under very adverse conditions,managed to come up with a winner.Definitely on the must see list for any classic cinema fan.

    As I write this The African Queen is sitting at a 9/10 rating on IMDb, with 86 percent giving it a 10/10. That makes it one of the most blatantly skewed ratings I have ever seen on IMDb, because this movie is awful. It is just plain bad. So it is clear to me that the studios have gotten pretty good at gaming the IMDb rating. I've noticed that ratings are often skewed pretty high on IMDb, and it has only gotten worse. But The African Queen takes the cake in terms of a dreadfully bad movie getting an impossibly high rating for what it is. Why is it bad? The script is like a work of fan fiction, and not in a good way. When you are seeing a movie for the first time and you are completing the actor's lines before they are, clearly it is lacking in any originality. There is zero tension. Even the decent actors in this movie deliver very poor performances. But I think they simply had nothing to work with. There is only so much an actor can do to salvage bad writing. And in this case, there was nothing they could do. And the special effects are very underwhelming. What kills me is that the boats in the Krakatoa, East of Java movie were much more impressive than the shippage in The African Queen, where they simply look like kind of plastic models flailing about in an old wash tub . I won't go on and on about how bad it is because it has already taken two hours of my life away. But suffice to say that this is an extremely uninspired film which I am sure Bogart will rank as one of his worst. And IMDb, the studio owned you on this one. This is nowhere near a 9/10, or even a 6 for that matter. Don't see it. Not even as a rental, or even on Blu Ray, HD, or whatever is next.

    I had caught the end of this film before but somehow had never watched it all the way through so when I saw it listed in the TV guide I had to watch it; now, having seen it, I can see why it is considered a classic. The film opens in 1914 in German East Africa, present day Tanzania, where an English missionary and his sister are taking a church service. They are interrupted by the steam boat 'African Queen' and her captain Charlie Allnut. He informs them of the war that has broken out in Europe and as such they are stranded in an enemy country. It isn't long before the Germans turn up and burn down the village; they leave the missionaries but the affect leaves the preacher a broken man and he soon dies. When Allnut returns he takes the sister, Rosie Sayer, aboard his boat and sets off down river. He suggests they find an island and sit the war out but she has other ideas... she wants to continue down river, past a German fort, over deadly rapids and on to the lake. This lake is patrolled by the German ship the Queen Louisa which is the only thing keeping British forces from attacking the German colony. She intends to take their small boat and sink the Louisa! I really enjoyed this film; Bogart was great as the gin-swilling steamer captain and Katherine Hepburn was equally good as the prim sister of the preacher; the two of them had a great on screen chemistry. Director John Huston did a fine job creating an exciting story; I was surprised just how good some of the special effects looked; it really looked like their small boat was being tossed around in the rapids even though a model was used... it helped of course that much of the movie was filmed on location in Africa; the scenery looked real because it was! While at heart the film is a romantic story between the two very different characters I couldn't help thinking about the film 'Apocalypse Now' as the boat went further and further along the river getting into various scrapes and approaching the deadly conclusion to its mission... this film is of course much lighter in tone! That isn't to say there isn't tension and more than once it looks as if the two protagonists are going to die before completing their self-given mission. If you want a good adventure that is suitable for all ages you could do a lot worse than this... I highly recommend it.

    When defending predictable, formulaic films, I often hear that "it's the road from A to B that matters". But when that road, as in The African Queen, in which A is Humphrey Bogart's ragged boatman and Katharine Hepburn's stern missionary not standing each other and B is them falling hopelessly in love, is not very interesting or entertaining, you have a problem. It's strange, everything I remembered about The African Queen was less pronounced now that I watched it again, for both better and worse. Firstly, the distance between A and B was a lot shorter  in the beginning, there was more of a slight annoyance or a stiff reservation than a downright hatred or dislike, and it didn't take very long before they fell into each other's arms. Secondly, Hepburn's character was a lot less annoying. I still don't think she (or Bogart) is very good, but I didn't exactly want her to die this time, and I guess their chemistry is all right. The romance was probably a bit less sappy, whereas the adventure and the finale were decidedly less riveting. One thing I did notice to a larger extent now was the pleasant Technicolor work, which is used to the greatest effect when there is a lot of nature on the screen, such as the opening scene where the camera sneaks through the jungle and enters the East African village of Kungdu. But other than that, The African Queen is still just a decent romantic adventure that I don't quite get the praise for.

    The African Queen is a fantastically told story of a gin-swilling riverboat captain and an uptight Methodist missionary. When the movie begins, we are told that the First World War is about to begin. Two Methodist missionaries, a brother and sister, are forced to deal with the German forces that invade the village at which they teach, as it is a British colony. The confrontation ends up killing the brother, leaving his sister, Rose, played marvelously by the always enjoyable Katharine Hepburn, to fend for herself. She takes in with a riverboat captain, played by the immensely talented Humphrey Bogart, named Charlie, who captains the smallish steamship, the African Queen. Their journey takes them down the Ulanga River in Africa. At the beginning of their journey, Rose devises a plan to retaliate against the Germans, for her country, and also to avenge her brother's death. Initially hesitant, Charlie agrees. They decide to turn the boat into a torpedo of sorts and destroy the German gunboat, the Queen Louisa, which is effectively blocking British forces. It is at this point in the film that their respective journeys begin. As the uncouth Charlie and the prim and proper Rose first embark, they are essentially night and day in comparison to one another. Bogart and Hepburn both turn in career performances in their rendition of this odd couple. Rose's strong will and unrelenting attitude convinces, Charlie, who didn't want to get involved in the first place, thinking her plan was suicide. The two actors do a fantastic job of keeping the audience's attention, as it is just the two on screen for a large majority of the movie. As the pair travel down the river, they first gain a begrudging respect for one another. As they traverse and survive the dangerous Ulanga River, that respect slowly starts blossoming into love. While Charlie had been traveling that river for years, he never noticed the natural beauty until he found himself falling for Rose. The pair also grow as individuals, with Charlie becoming more mature and Rose shedding a little of her inhibition. John Huston does a wonderful crafting this story. He gets the best out of his actors and knows how to work with pace and timing. He does a great job of leading us down the path of their relationship without it feeling forced or campy, as happens in so many films today. He masterfully crafts a certain mood to the film; silly, dramatic, and high tension, all at appropriate moments. When the pair is trudging through the marsh, for example, you feel a real sense of doom and despair, as if they might not get out alive. This film just goes to show the incredible talents of the actors and director. Every moment felt genuine and authentic. This film certainly deserves its place in cinematic history as a classic. 8/10

    Charlie Allnut is a rascal. He is also a boat captain in Africa, who ferries things up and down the river in 1914. One day he stops at a missionary, where prim Rose Sayer is preaching along with her brother. Charlie has tea with them, but to say they get along is an overstatement. Charlie leaves, but not before telling the English Rose and her brother that Germany has declared war. Soon after he leaves, the camp is taken over by Germans, who burn the huts down and leave Rose and her brother to fend for them selves. Her brother catches the fever, and dies. It is then that Charlie comes back. He helps Rose bury her brother, and then asks her along to wait out the war in the jungle. Soon after, they find a place to hide, when Rose begins to look at a map. She asks Charlie why they can't go up the river, and he tells her that there are rapids, a German fort, waterfalls, and at the end, a big German steamer, patrolling the lake so the British can't move down. Noticing Charlie has a lot of explosives, that he was carrying for the mine, Rose asks if they can't ride to the lake, and then blow up the German steamer. Charlie says no, but Rose persists, and you can see where this is going. I know it sounds dark, but it is really anything but. There is one thing that can impede you from enjoying The African Queen: cynicism. You cannot look at this film from a cynical point of view. You'll hate it. That said, you can going into it being cynical, but you have to drop it after five minutes. Okay, got it? Good, we can move on. Three films have been called Huston's best: The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of The Sierra Madre and The African Queen. At least, from what I've heard. I did not like The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre, and as I have not reviewed The Maltese Falcon, I'll hold judgment until then. So what is Huston's best film? The African Queen, from what I've seen. Many people have tried to describe the essence of this film. Is it Bogart, Hepburn or Huston? Is it the shooting on location? Or maybe the story? I cannot pinpoint the film's greatness. It is like a cozy den, that once you've entered, you never want to leave. The only other film I've had such a reaction to is Casablanca. It is a great film, but why? The performances by Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn are certainly part of that magic.You only have to see them on screen for a second, and you are instantly with them. Bogart plays the kind of character only Bogart could play, and likewise with Hepburn. They inhabit their characters with an energy that cannot be defined. You do not think of them as Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, but as Rose Sayer and Charlie Allnut. The characters are that memorable. It is the kind of love story that feels alive and fresh, despite how in a different film it would seem clich&eacute;d. Here it embraces the clich&eacute;, and is better because of it. The development feels like a natural extension of the plot. Speaking of plot, the screenplay by James Agee and John Huston achieves that perfect balance of giving you a plot that keeps you interested, and two leads you cannot help but love. Agee had a heart attack before he could finish the screenplay, so Huston brought it down to Africa to finish it. He brought Peter Viertel to work on it with him, and sometimes they would write the next scene the day before it was shot. Shooting on an actual river in Africa must have presented a massive challenge for the cinematographer, but he succeeded admirably. The film is neither a walking travel ad, but it doesn't forget about it's landscape either. Perhaps the only weak link is the score, but even that can not impede the film from greatness. This brings me to Huston's direction. He has often been accused of his films looking staged, with no amazing cinematic tricks employed. I cannot defend him, but I can say this. Huston is a director. He is not an actor's director, a cinematographer's director, or a screenwriters director. He is truly a director, he oversees all aspects of production with the same wise gaze. He is not an auteur. He trusts the people he works with to do a good job, and just oversees them doing it. This kind of film making is the only kind that would work for The African Queen. And it does, Huston delivers yet another beautiful adventure film. If you are feeling low, this is the kind of film that can make you feel better. When I gave The Dead ten stars, it took me a while to make the decision. Here it took me a second. The African Queen is an indisputable masterpiece, for now and for always. The African Queen, 1951, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn and Robert Morely, Directed by John Huston, 10/10 (A+) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie. You can read this this and other reviews at http://everyjohnhustonmovie.blogspot.ca/)

    The African Queen is a fantastically told story of a gin-swilling riverboat captain and an uptight Methodist missionary. When the movie begins, we are told that the First World War is about to begin. Two Methodist missionaries, a brother and sister, are forced to deal with the German forces that invade the village at which they teach, as it is a British colony. The confrontation ends up killing the brother, leaving his sister, Rose, played marvelously by the always enjoyable Katharine Hepburn, to fend for herself. She takes in with a riverboat captain, played by the immensely talented Humphrey Bogart, named Charlie, who captains the smallish steamship, the African Queen. Their journey takes them down the Ulanga River in Africa. At the beginning of their journey, Rose devises a plan to retaliate against the Germans, for her country, and also to avenge her brother's death. Initially hesitant, Charlie agrees. They decide to turn the boat into a torpedo of sorts and destroy the German gunboat, the Queen Louisa, which is effectively blocking British forces. It is at this point in the film that their respective journeys begin. As the uncouth Charlie and the prim and proper Rose first embark, they are essentially night and day in comparison to one another. Bogart and Hepburn both turn in career performances in their rendition of this odd couple. Rose's strong will and unrelenting attitude convinces, Charlie, who didn't want to get involved in the first place, thinking her plan was suicide. The two actors do a fantastic job of keeping the audience's attention, as it is just the two on screen for a large majority of the movie. As the pair travel down the river, they first gain a begrudging respect for one another. As they traverse and survive the dangerous Ulanga River, that respect slowly starts blossoming into love. While Charlie had been traveling that river for years, he never noticed the natural beauty until he found himself falling for Rose. The pair also grow as individuals, with Charlie becoming more mature and Rose shedding a little of her inhibition. John Huston does a wonderful crafting this story. He gets the best out of his actors and knows how to work with pace and timing. He does a great job of leading us down the path of their relationship without it feeling forced or campy, as happens in so many films today. He masterfully crafts a certain mood to the film; silly, dramatic, and high tension, all at appropriate moments. When the pair is trudging through the marsh, for example, you feel a real sense of doom and despair, as if they might not get out alive. This film just goes to show the incredible talents of the actors and director. Every moment felt genuine and authentic. This film certainly deserves its place in cinematic history as a classic. 8/10

    Charlie Allnut is a rascal. He is also a boat captain in Africa, who ferries things up and down the river in 1914. One day he stops at a missionary, where prim Rose Sayer is preaching along with her brother. Charlie has tea with them, but to say they get along is an overstatement. Charlie leaves, but not before telling the English Rose and her brother that Germany has declared war. Soon after he leaves, the camp is taken over by Germans, who burn the huts down and leave Rose and her brother to fend for them selves. Her brother catches the fever, and dies. It is then that Charlie comes back. He helps Rose bury her brother, and then asks her along to wait out the war in the jungle. Soon after, they find a place to hide, when Rose begins to look at a map. She asks Charlie why they can't go up the river, and he tells her that there are rapids, a German fort, waterfalls, and at the end, a big German steamer, patrolling the lake so the British can't move down. Noticing Charlie has a lot of explosives, that he was carrying for the mine, Rose asks if they can't ride to the lake, and then blow up the German steamer. Charlie says no, but Rose persists, and you can see where this is going. I know it sounds dark, but it is really anything but. There is one thing that can impede you from enjoying The African Queen: cynicism. You cannot look at this film from a cynical point of view. You'll hate it. That said, you can going into it being cynical, but you have to drop it after five minutes. Okay, got it? Good, we can move on. Three films have been called Huston's best: The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of The Sierra Madre and The African Queen. At least, from what I've heard. I did not like The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre, and as I have not reviewed The Maltese Falcon, I'll hold judgment until then. So what is Huston's best film? The African Queen, from what I've seen. Many people have tried to describe the essence of this film. Is it Bogart, Hepburn or Huston? Is it the shooting on location? Or maybe the story? I cannot pinpoint the film's greatness. It is like a cozy den, that once you've entered, you never want to leave. The only other film I've had such a reaction to is Casablanca. It is a great film, but why? The performances by Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn are certainly part of that magic.You only have to see them on screen for a second, and you are instantly with them. Bogart plays the kind of character only Bogart could play, and likewise with Hepburn. They inhabit their characters with an energy that cannot be defined. You do not think of them as Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, but as Rose Sayer and Charlie Allnut. The characters are that memorable. It is the kind of love story that feels alive and fresh, despite how in a different film it would seem clich&eacute;d. Here it embraces the clich&eacute;, and is better because of it. The development feels like a natural extension of the plot. Speaking of plot, the screenplay by James Agee and John Huston achieves that perfect balance of giving you a plot that keeps you interested, and two leads you cannot help but love. Agee had a heart attack before he could finish the screenplay, so Huston brought it down to Africa to finish it. He brought Peter Viertel to work on it with him, and sometimes they would write the next scene the day before it was shot. Shooting on an actual river in Africa must have presented a massive challenge for the cinematographer, but he succeeded admirably. The film is neither a walking travel ad, but it doesn't forget about it's landscape either. Perhaps the only weak link is the score, but even that can not impede the film from greatness. This brings me to Huston's direction. He has often been accused of his films looking staged, with no amazing cinematic tricks employed. I cannot defend him, but I can say this. Huston is a director. He is not an actor's director, a cinematographer's director, or a screenwriters director. He is truly a director, he oversees all aspects of production with the same wise gaze. He is not an auteur. He trusts the people he works with to do a good job, and just oversees them doing it. This kind of film making is the only kind that would work for The African Queen. And it does, Huston delivers yet another beautiful adventure film. If you are feeling low, this is the kind of film that can make you feel better. When I gave The Dead ten stars, it took me a while to make the decision. Here it took me a second. The African Queen is an indisputable masterpiece, for now and for always. The African Queen, 1951, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn and Robert Morely, Directed by John Huston, 10/10 (A+) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

    always put off watching this movie as the combination of Bogart and Hepburn didn't interest me. decided to watch it to night as there was nothing else on the screen. well...i loved the film and i was completely entranced by Mr. Bogart. too see him smile....at last and his drunk scenes were absolutely on track. sure the story line is a bit...exaggerated but it still is a poignant movie. Katherine Hepburn another one who never captured my heart is quite good in this one. she has an ability to feed the other actors right on with her replies and reactions. now I'm glad I've watched it and recommend it to all people who like good acting and a movie that has thrills....sentimentality....and humour.

    Just like brandy, The African Queen gets better with age. Humphrey Bogart (Charlie Allnut) won a best actor Academy award for his great performance. He beat Marlon Brando (A Streetcar Named Desire)....and that was a correct decision. Early in his career Bogey was mostly a bootlegger, then came his period of playing "private Dicks". Few people knew he could REALLY act. Then in the Treasure of Sierra Madre and this great movie, he showed what he could do. Katherine Hepburn was at least as good as Meryl Streep....and in this wonderful film she once again shows her class. The African Queen is about ..the strangeness of love..how little boats can do Titanical things..and that entertainment is (and always will be) the reason we visit cinemas. Having a good script is so important to any movie .. Bogey and Kate deliver there lines with aplomb. There is a lot of fun in The African Queen, and this 1951 film delivers at all levels. John Huston (a close friend of Bogey) directs probably his best movie. Bogey did not like working on location, but thankfully Huston advised him that there would be enough booze for the whole shoot..!!

    Recently I watched The African Queen and at first I had my doubts; but after finishing the film it was awesome. A timeless movies that cannot be remade or re-casted as Bogart and Hepburn at their best. Something that will be remembered as one of the moments to be modelled for todays cinematic experience. The movie is based on a novel written by C.S forester about 2 couples played by Hepburn and Bogart going through outrageous circumstances against the Germans. But more importantly it is about the spectacular chemistry between Hepburn and Bogart going through the times of the German war time era. A film where the Technicolour vision makes the movie come alive. Overall I would highly recommend this movie if you ever get the chance. A rare gem that beenfound to shine through the years for a fresh look at an phenomenal casting, directing and location.

    In central Africa, while War World 2 is affecting the world, a humble and simple boat captain and an elderly English missionary woman join forces, although reluctant with staying with one another, to travel on the captain's small boat (The African Queen) in order to sink a German ship, and to escape the woman's village of residence, raided by the Germans. In the small boat, the formalities and class differences become less and less obvious, until affection between the two protagonists explodes. Director John Huston, always eclectic in his choice of movies, puts in The African Queen big sparks of Romance and Light Comedy, Adventure, but also serious Drama, because of the dramatic background of the period depicted. One of those great Hollywood classics that shaped many modern films, because of it's original setting (Africa, too, was touched by the war, so the circumstances are very familiar) and situation of the characters, who slowly brake all bonds of formality. A bit rushed ending, with too much going on at once.

    In the 1950's,location shooting was a rarity,so the locale selected,everyone involved with this production knew it was going to be very hard work to get this film made.They just didn't know how tough until work began.I guess it helped to have one of the best directors of that day (not to mention in all of cinema history),John Huston,paired with two of the best actors to grace the screen,Humphrey Bogart and Kate Hepburn.The story is very captivating,and these cinema giants,working harder than usual under very adverse conditions,managed to come up with a winner.Definitely on the must see list for any classic cinema fan.

    As I write this The African Queen is sitting at a 9/10 rating on IMDb, with 86 percent giving it a 10/10. That makes it one of the most blatantly skewed ratings I have ever seen on IMDb, because this movie is awful. It is just plain bad. So it is clear to me that the studios have gotten pretty good at gaming the IMDb rating. I've noticed that ratings are often skewed pretty high on IMDb, and it has only gotten worse. But The African Queen takes the cake in terms of a dreadfully bad movie getting an impossibly high rating for what it is. Why is it bad? The script is like a work of fan fiction, and not in a good way. When you are seeing a movie for the first time and you are completing the actor's lines before they are, clearly it is lacking in any originality. There is zero tension. Even the decent actors in this movie deliver very poor performances. But I think they simply had nothing to work with. There is only so much an actor can do to salvage bad writing. And in this case, there was nothing they could do. And the special effects are very underwhelming. What kills me is that the boats in the Krakatoa, East of Java movie were much more impressive than the shippage in The African Queen, where they simply look like kind of plastic models flailing about in an old wash tub . I won't go on and on about how bad it is because it has already taken two hours of my life away. But suffice to say that this is an extremely uninspired film which I am sure Bogart will rank as one of his worst. And IMDb, the studio owned you on this one. This is nowhere near a 9/10, or even a 6 for that matter. Don't see it. Not even as a rental, or even on Blu Ray, HD, or whatever is next.

    I had caught the end of this film before but somehow had never watched it all the way through so when I saw it listed in the TV guide I had to watch it; now, having seen it, I can see why it is considered a classic. The film opens in 1914 in German East Africa, present day Tanzania, where an English missionary and his sister are taking a church service. They are interrupted by the steam boat 'African Queen' and her captain Charlie Allnut. He informs them of the war that has broken out in Europe and as such they are stranded in an enemy country. It isn't long before the Germans turn up and burn down the village; they leave the missionaries but the affect leaves the preacher a broken man and he soon dies. When Allnut returns he takes the sister, Rosie Sayer, aboard his boat and sets off down river. He suggests they find an island and sit the war out but she has other ideas... she wants to continue down river, past a German fort, over deadly rapids and on to the lake. This lake is patrolled by the German ship the Queen Louisa which is the only thing keeping British forces from attacking the German colony. She intends to take their small boat and sink the Louisa! I really enjoyed this film; Bogart was great as the gin-swilling steamer captain and Katherine Hepburn was equally good as the prim sister of the preacher; the two of them had a great on screen chemistry. Director John Huston did a fine job creating an exciting story; I was surprised just how good some of the special effects looked; it really looked like their small boat was being tossed around in the rapids even though a model was used... it helped of course that much of the movie was filmed on location in Africa; the scenery looked real because it was! While at heart the film is a romantic story between the two very different characters I couldn't help thinking about the film 'Apocalypse Now' as the boat went further and further along the river getting into various scrapes and approaching the deadly conclusion to its mission... this film is of course much lighter in tone! That isn't to say there isn't tension and more than once it looks as if the two protagonists are going to die before completing their self-given mission. If you want a good adventure that is suitable for all ages you could do a lot worse than this... I highly recommend it.

    When defending predictable, formulaic films, I often hear that "it's the road from A to B that matters". But when that road, as in The African Queen, in which A is Humphrey Bogart's ragged boatman and Katharine Hepburn's stern missionary not standing each other and B is them falling hopelessly in love, is not very interesting or entertaining, you have a problem. It's strange, everything I remembered about The African Queen was less pronounced now that I watched it again, for both better and worse. Firstly, the distance between A and B was a lot shorter  in the beginning, there was more of a slight annoyance or a stiff reservation than a downright hatred or dislike, and it didn't take very long before they fell into each other's arms. Secondly, Hepburn's character was a lot less annoying. I still don't think she (or Bogart) is very good, but I didn't exactly want her to die this time, and I guess their chemistry is all right. The romance was probably a bit less sappy, whereas the adventure and the finale were decidedly less riveting. One thing I did notice to a larger extent now was the pleasant Technicolor work, which is used to the greatest effect when there is a lot of nature on the screen, such as the opening scene where the camera sneaks through the jungle and enters the East African village of Kungdu. But other than that, The African Queen is still just a decent romantic adventure that I don't quite get the praise for.

    In central Africa, while War World 2 is affecting the world, a humble and simple boat captain and an elderly English missionary woman join forces, although reluctant with staying with one another, to travel on the captain's small boat (The African Queen) in order to sink a German ship, and to escape the woman's village of residence, raided by the Germans. In the small boat, the formalities and class differences become less and less obvious, until affection between the two protagonists explodes. Director John Huston, always eclectic in his choice of movies, puts in The African Queen big sparks of Romance and Light Comedy, Adventure, but also serious Drama, because of the dramatic background of the period depicted. One of those great Hollywood classics that shaped many modern films, because of it's original setting (Africa, too, was touched by the war, so the circumstances are very familiar) and situation of the characters, who slowly brake all bonds of formality. A bit rushed ending, with too much going on at once.

    In the 1950's,location shooting was a rarity,so the locale selected,everyone involved with this production knew it was going to be very hard work to get this film made.They just didn't know how tough until work began.I guess it helped to have one of the best directors of that day (not to mention in all of cinema history),John Huston,paired with two of the best actors to grace the screen,Humphrey Bogart and Kate Hepburn.The story is very captivating,and these cinema giants,working harder than usual under very adverse conditions,managed to come up with a winner.Definitely on the must see list for any classic cinema fan.

    As I write this The African Queen is sitting at a 9/10 rating on IMDb, with 86 percent giving it a 10/10. That makes it one of the most blatantly skewed ratings I have ever seen on IMDb, because this movie is awful. It is just plain bad. So it is clear to me that the studios have gotten pretty good at gaming the IMDb rating. I've noticed that ratings are often skewed pretty high on IMDb, and it has only gotten worse. But The African Queen takes the cake in terms of a dreadfully bad movie getting an impossibly high rating for what it is. Why is it bad? The script is like a work of fan fiction, and not in a good way. When you are seeing a movie for the first time and you are completing the actor's lines before they are, clearly it is lacking in any originality. There is zero tension. Even the decent actors in this movie deliver very poor performances. But I think they simply had nothing to work with. There is only so much an actor can do to salvage bad writing. And in this case, there was nothing they could do. And the special effects are very underwhelming. What kills me is that the boats in the Krakatoa, East of Java movie were much more impressive than the shippage in The African Queen, where they simply look like kind of plastic models flailing about in an old wash tub . I won't go on and on about how bad it is because it has already taken two hours of my life away. But suffice to say that this is an extremely uninspired film which I am sure Bogart will rank as one of his worst. And IMDb, the studio owned you on this one. This is nowhere near a 9/10, or even a 6 for that matter. Don't see it. Not even as a rental, or even on Blu Ray, HD, or whatever is next.

    I had caught the end of this film before but somehow had never watched it all the way through so when I saw it listed in the TV guide I had to watch it; now, having seen it, I can see why it is considered a classic. The film opens in 1914 in German East Africa, present day Tanzania, where an English missionary and his sister are taking a church service. They are interrupted by the steam boat 'African Queen' and her captain Charlie Allnut. He informs them of the war that has broken out in Europe and as such they are stranded in an enemy country. It isn't long before the Germans turn up and burn down the village; they leave the missionaries but the affect leaves the preacher a broken man and he soon dies. When Allnut returns he takes the sister, Rosie Sayer, aboard his boat and sets off down river. He suggests they find an island and sit the war out but she has other ideas... she wants to continue down river, past a German fort, over deadly rapids and on to the lake. This lake is patrolled by the German ship the Queen Louisa which is the only thing keeping British forces from attacking the German colony. She intends to take their small boat and sink the Louisa! I really enjoyed this film; Bogart was great as the gin-swilling steamer captain and Katherine Hepburn was equally good as the prim sister of the preacher; the two of them had a great on screen chemistry. Director John Huston did a fine job creating an exciting story; I was surprised just how good some of the special effects looked; it really looked like their small boat was being tossed around in the rapids even though a model was used... it helped of course that much of the movie was filmed on location in Africa; the scenery looked real because it was! While at heart the film is a romantic story between the two very different characters I couldn't help thinking about the film 'Apocalypse Now' as the boat went further and further along the river getting into various scrapes and approaching the deadly conclusion to its mission... this film is of course much lighter in tone! That isn't to say there isn't tension and more than once it looks as if the two protagonists are going to die before completing their self-given mission. If you want a good adventure that is suitable for all ages you could do a lot worse than this... I highly recommend it.

    When defending predictable, formulaic films, I often hear that "it's the road from A to B that matters". But when that road, as in The African Queen, in which A is Humphrey Bogart's ragged boatman and Katharine Hepburn's stern missionary not standing each other and B is them falling hopelessly in love, is not very interesting or entertaining, you have a problem. It's strange, everything I remembered about The African Queen was less pronounced now that I watched it again, for both better and worse. Firstly, the distance between A and B was a lot shorter  in the beginning, there was more of a slight annoyance or a stiff reservation than a downright hatred or dislike, and it didn't take very long before they fell into each other's arms. Secondly, Hepburn's character was a lot less annoying. I still don't think she (or Bogart) is very good, but I didn't exactly want her to die this time, and I guess their chemistry is all right. The romance was probably a bit less sappy, whereas the adventure and the finale were decidedly less riveting. One thing I did notice to a larger extent now was the pleasant Technicolor work, which is used to the greatest effect when there is a lot of nature on the screen, such as the opening scene where the camera sneaks through the jungle and enters the East African village of Kungdu. But other than that, The African Queen is still just a decent romantic adventure that I don't quite get the praise for.

    The African Queen is a fantastically told story of a gin-swilling riverboat captain and an uptight Methodist missionary. When the movie begins, we are told that the First World War is about to begin. Two Methodist missionaries, a brother and sister, are forced to deal with the German forces that invade the village at which they teach, as it is a British colony. The confrontation ends up killing the brother, leaving his sister, Rose, played marvelously by the always enjoyable Katharine Hepburn, to fend for herself. She takes in with a riverboat captain, played by the immensely talented Humphrey Bogart, named Charlie, who captains the smallish steamship, the African Queen. Their journey takes them down the Ulanga River in Africa. At the beginning of their journey, Rose devises a plan to retaliate against the Germans, for her country, and also to avenge her brother's death. Initially hesitant, Charlie agrees. They decide to turn the boat into a torpedo of sorts and destroy the German gunboat, the Queen Louisa, which is effectively blocking British forces. It is at this point in the film that their respective journeys begin. As the uncouth Charlie and the prim and proper Rose first embark, they are essentially night and day in comparison to one another. Bogart and Hepburn both turn in career performances in their rendition of this odd couple. Rose's strong will and unrelenting attitude convinces, Charlie, who didn't want to get involved in the first place, thinking her plan was suicide. The two actors do a fantastic job of keeping the audience's attention, as it is just the two on screen for a large majority of the movie. As the pair travel down the river, they first gain a begrudging respect for one another. As they traverse and survive the dangerous Ulanga River, that respect slowly starts blossoming into love. While Charlie had been traveling that river for years, he never noticed the natural beauty until he found himself falling for Rose. The pair also grow as individuals, with Charlie becoming more mature and Rose shedding a little of her inhibition. John Huston does a wonderful crafting this story. He gets the best out of his actors and knows how to work with pace and timing. He does a great job of leading us down the path of their relationship without it feeling forced or campy, as happens in so many films today. He masterfully crafts a certain mood to the film; silly, dramatic, and high tension, all at appropriate moments. When the pair is trudging through the marsh, for example, you feel a real sense of doom and despair, as if they might not get out alive. This film just goes to show the incredible talents of the actors and director. Every moment felt genuine and authentic. This film certainly deserves its place in cinematic history as a classic. 8/10
