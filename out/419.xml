  A magic nanny comes to work for a cold banker's unhappy family.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The movie combines songs, color and sequences of live action blended with the movements of animated figures. Mary Poppins is a kind of Super-nanny who flies in with her umbrella in response to the request of the Banks children and proceeds to put things right with the aid of her rather extraordinary magical powers.

    I Watched this movie on GO and online but mostly on DVD. I did not get the point of the movie because it was all mixed and not that entertaining, however the music was perfect and a spoonful of sugar ha ha. One of the most cool thing in this movie was how you get to feel the wonders and thoughts in the characters minds and hearts which was truly mad and fun. Another Its a very long movie with lots of colours and funny graphics, however it did not have any movie texture or any scenes which didn't have utter nonsense. I would recommend this movie to people whom love and admire magical tales and flying in the air blah blah.

    I always wanted to see Mary Poppins as the idea of a magical nanny really appealed to me and I have to admit that the animation is pretty amazing for its time but the story is usually what interests me most and the problem I had is that I watched this movie after I'd seen Nanny McPhee. I thought it would be an original story with great songs. I already loved the 'Spoon full of sugar'-song and the Supercallifragi-song as I had lots of Disney CD's before I watched the movie. So I convinced two people to watch it together with me as it's a classic. And we were about halfway when everybody looked at each other and said: "Do you still like this?" And we all had to admit we were really annoyed, not only bored but actually annoyed with the story. Sure there is lots of potential in a story about a magical nanny! And still, there is no real story, no story that keeps you tied to the screen anyway. We sat through the whole movie (again, because it's a classic) but we all didn't really enjoy it. I was actually bothered by a few questions afterwards: Why is that stupid Dick Van Dyke-character in this movie? Why put all these chimney sweepers and distract us from the really interesting character (or you would expect so anyway): Mary Poppins. It's the title of the movie! Why not focus on all the magical things she can do and will do to help educate and bring up the children? There must be more than magical room-cleaning... What annoyed me most was the 'Jolly holly day with Mary'-song which went on and on and on. Every time I thought the stupid song was over, it started again and it just put the story on hold. Sadly enough, this movie was made back in those days when musical songs did not yet carry the story and unraveled extra plot elements but when songs were a detour. And what are penguins doing in this movie anyway? It's like they wanted to show off with what they were able to do at the expense of the story. So I hate to say this as I'm a big Disney fan! (But that doesn't mean I'll blindly love every single one of the movies) I really didn't like Mary Poppins. Give it a shot. Maybe you will... but I sure didn't. One day, I'd like to give it another shot but not for at least ten years. I'd probably like Nanny McPhee turned into animation but Mary Poppins is just not for me...

    Mary Poppins is one of those films that works on every level its been given. This was the film that Walt Disney dedicated most of his life and career to get made. He and his exceptional team of geniuses lifted the characters and some story from P.L. Traver's "good" book and transformed it into something that will stand the test of time. The story is about the dysfunctional Banks family in Edwardian London. The children Jane and Michael are rambunctious and keep annoying nannies out of the house. The parents, George and Winifred, are good people but are way too focused on their profession and causes to notice that the kids just want their love. Then comes Mary Poppins on her flying umbrella. She is a sweet but still stern lady who takes the kids on these whimsical adventures and sings catchy songs. But she's there for more than that (something way deeper), she is there to help mend the broken family. What makes great characters is a great cast, and that movie has it all. Julie Andrews (in her film debut) gives one of the best heroines ever put to screen. She is "prctically perfect in every way." Dick Van Dyke gives a very funny and at times touching performance as her jack-of-all-trades cockney companion Bert. David Tomlinson gives possibly one of my favorite performances in any movie as Mr. Banks. You see his journey over the course of the film and the moment is beautiful when he realizes that his kids and his wife are more important than what his bosses (played memorably by Arthur Malet and Dick van Dyke in heavy makeup) at the bank tell him and what he thought was important. And Glynis Johns gives a funny performance as the chipper suffragette Mrs. Banks. The story and score are something to behold. This is one of the best thought out of any Disney movie before or since (except Beauty and the Beast) Writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi concocted a story full of whimsy, sweetness, and surprisingly, very good drama. And then the Sherman Brother's score adds to the timeless quality of the film. There are showstoppers ("Supercalifragilistiexpialidocious" and "A Spoonful of Sugar") but the ones I like are either subtle or just fun to watch and listen to, "Step in Time, "A Man has Dreams," and the best song of the movie "Feed the Birds" (which features a great cameo by the great Jane Darwell) The song gives away Mary Poppins' message, which is that the small things in life are important, and family love is the ultimate gift for any person young or old. The man who also held this all together and mixed them in a beautiful way was long time Disney director Robert Stevenson, knowing just when to blend lightness and whimsy with pathos and drama. Then there are the special effects. This is one of the first movies I saw where I was blown away (even as a little kid) because i thought it was all real. It's one of those films that uses special effects to tell the story, not to distract the viewer. Nowhere is this more evident than artist Peter Ellenshaw's masterpiece matte paintings. They are warm, nostalgia, and thoroughly convincing. The animated sequence is fun too, with the waiter penguins being the best part of that whole adventure This is Walt Disney's best film, and was hailed as such when it premiered in August 1964. His fingerprints were all over this film too, as he made really good contributions to the story and characters (he was the one who made the animated waiters Penguins, Brilliant!) The reviews and box office numbers were all outstanding. Then it was nominated for a staggering 13 Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and won 5 Oscars, including Best Actress for Julie Andrews. Regrettably it did not win Best Picture, but it still has endured forever in the hearts and minds of children and adults who have seen it. Like the title of my review suggests, this is one of my all time favorite movies. And this is one of the films that inspired my interest in filmmaking, and one I will always look to with affection. I will be watching this many more times, and never get tired of it.

    Walt Disney was one of the most iconic figures of the twentieth century. He left a legacy behind filled with classic, unforgettable films like "Show White," "Sleeping Beauty" and "101 Dalmatians." With "Mary Poppins," however, he reached his zenith and produced perhaps the greatest musical ever made, a beautiful film for both adults and children. While the movie doesn't exactly do justice to the wonderful P.L. Travers' books, its originality and charm is as magical as Mary Poppins herself. Julie Andrews is perfect for the title role; pretty but cold and firm. Dick Van Dyke really shines here as Bert the chimney sweep; it's perhaps the only time he was allowed to display the full extent of his prodigious talents. Andrews and Van Dyke clearly have a great chemistry together. Disney filled "Mary Poppins" with top notch character actors, like Reta Shaw, Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher and Ed Wynn. Reginald Owen is a treat as Admiral Boom, along with Jane Darwell as the old lady behind one of the many unforgettable songs in the film, "Feed The Birds." Glynis Johns is cute as a very innocent suffragette, and David Tomlinson plays the role of distracted father/crusty banker to the hilt. But it's the songs that really make "Mary Poppins" so special. Every Baby Boomer knows them by heart; my personal favorite is the soaring (no pun intended), "Let's Go Fly A Kite." The film deserved all the accolades and praise it earned, and it remains one of the finest films in motion picture history.

    I have to admit that it's rather miraculous that I am able to remember a few of the first movies that I've ever seen as a child. I am able to recall seeing Disney films like Cinderella (1950) and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) for the first time at a very early age. So it's no surprise that I'm still able to recall seeing Mary Poppins (1964) for the first time at a young age and remembering how special an experience it was. What makes it all the more memorable is that I still enjoy Mary Poppins looking back at it as an adult just as much as I did when I saw it as a kid. In my opinion, that's the key ingredient regarding what makes a children's film timeless in the first place. We follow an unhappy British family led by Mr. and Mrs. Banks (David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns respectively) during the 1910s that are looking to hire a new nanny after their most recent one (Elsa Lanchester) quit. What they get is a magical nanny by the name of Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews in her amazing, Oscar-winning theatrical debut) who changes the entire family's lives forever. The kids (Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber) are taken on adventures beyond their wildest dreams such as jumping into chalk drawings, cleaning their room with the snap of their fingers, and other similar outings which are more magical than they sound. Joining with them on their adventures is an upbeat jack-of- all-trades by the name of Bert (Dick Van Dyke in a highly joyful role). This film basically covers Mary's time with the family until the "wind changes direction", both literally and metaphorically. What is fascinating about the story for this family film is that it teaches lessons not only to children, but also to adults. In its own unique way, it basically tells every family to meet in the middle between what the children expect from their parents and what the parents expect from their children. That means that parents should be more understanding of their children's playfulness and children should only have so much of a good thing. That's exactly the type of family dynamic that Mary Poppins tries to teach the entire Banks family through her own mysterious yet somehow wise actions. It is a profound and meaningful dynamic for any family to learn and strive for, and it's one crucial reason why Mary Poppins is still an original and unique family picture almost 50 years since it first came out. But of course, it isn't the only reason why I still love Mary Poppins now. Looking back at it again, I just picked up on how funny, witty and charming this movie really is. At times, the humor bares comparison with some of the greatest comedies of the 20th century like Duck Soup (1933) and Modern Times (1936). Other times, I was displaying an affectionate smile either for the terrific lines of dialogue made possible by writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi or recalling just how cool and charming every scene is. Remember the scene with Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) floating up in the air because he's laughing so hard? Remember the chimney sweeps (including Bert) doing some dangerous dancing on the rooftops? This film contains just one great scene after another and at a running time of more than 2 hours, it all moves exceedingly well. If that isn't a compliment to Walt Disney's master storytelling, I don't know what is. I briefly mentioned earlier that this was Julie Andrews' acting debut as the main character Mary Poppins and considering that she won an Oscar for her first performance, it's an impressive way to start out her career. Between her superb singing skills, her comfort in the role, and her overall excellent delivery, I can definitely see why she earned the Oscar. I know Dick Van Dyke has received criticism for his British accent, but to be brutally honest, I never saw the problem because I don't know anything about true Cockney accents. I honestly loved Dick Van Dyke in this movie regardless. I thought he had charm and wit to spare, he worked very well with the kids, he always had a positive attitude, he was highly entertaining overall. Even David Tomlinson is outstanding as Mr. Banks. For me, this is the strict parental figure done right. He may be able to tolerate the playfulness of his children for a very limited time, but the filmmakers still made a likable character out of him and somehow make his stubbornness funny. I think we all know how great the music and songs written by Richard and Robert Sherman are here. We all remember the song "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and the meaning of that unorthodox word. It's practically a word that's used when there's nothing else to say, and there's nothing else I can say about that word except..the word. How do you like that? There's a reason why this film is one of the only 2 Disney movies to be on the list of the AFI's 25 Greatest Musicals. The fact that it's filled with timeless songs such as "A Spoonful of Sugar", "I Love to Laugh" and the Oscar-winning "Chim Chim Cheree" should explain enough. They're cheerful, they're memorable, they're catchy, the songs and music are basically everything you could ask for from a musical. Mary Poppins easily takes its place amongst the finest films that Disney has ever put out. The story flows very well at 139 minutes and the fact that it moves more efficiently than most films of that running time is further proof of Mr. Disney's master skills as a storyteller. The music, the acting, the characters, the writing and even some of the special effects all come together in a wonderful family film that is "practically perfect in every way".

    Just for a moment, think of all those movies about monsters and manifestations of evil. There is the creature in Alien, the machine in Terminator, Predator and the various zombie movies, blood sucking vampire movies, movies with representations of the devil in various forms, including Al Pacino, and all the other incarnate creatures of hell. Have you ever wondered why all the creatures of supposed evil are so ghastly, armed with sharp teeth, claws and mouths that emit flames? Why do they require this weaponry? You understand why when you look at their opponents; they have to take on the likes of Mary Poppins. Mary Poppins is essentially a white witch. And she is awesomely powerful. Every time I watch a clip of "A Spoon Full Of Sugar" it sends shivers up my spine and makes me realise just how seriously omnipotent this lady is. If Mary Poppins was offended by the behaviour of Alien, Predator, Al Pacino's devil and the fury of the Incredible Hulk all at the same time, she would have them wearing nappies and a bib with a click of her fingers. Mary Poppins is God's white Protestant representative on planet Earth and is armed with all the tools to dispatch harmony on our poor souls. Unfortunately it is only a movie. Mary Poppins is a character every child needs to be able to call upon. Rather her than Santa Claus.

    I'd like to think that I've seen a lot of movies, of varying quality and genre; enough to believe I have at least a basic grasp of cinema as a whole. But during all the classics and tripe I've endured over the years, Mary Poppins has somehow managed to evade me. I was too busy watching rabbits getting torn to pieces in Watership Down (1978) and clapping giddily at Rocky Balboa's training montage in Rocky (1976) as a child to be distracted by something quite as colourful as this. So, it's at the ripe old age of 28 that I came round to sitting through Mary Poppins, to struggle through its squeaky-clean visage and many, many songs that I somehow knew all the words to before seeing the film. Well, I was wrong to be so cynical, as although the film is hardly what I would call a classic, it's really rather good. London, 1910. Merry jack-of-all-trades Bert (Dick Van Dyke) is playing a one-man-band to an enthusiastic street audience when he senses something magical in the air, signalling the return of his good friend Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews). He takes us into the stable yet unhappy Banks' family home, where the household is ran by lord-of-his-castle Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson), and his suffragette wife Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns). Busy attending to work and other matters, the Banks' have started to neglect their children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber). After their umpteenth nanny walks out on them, Mr. Banks makes a desperate newspaper plea for a nanny who will lay down the law, and teach the children respect and the harshness of life. So enters Mary Poppins, 'perfect in every way', a nanny who is as strict as she needs to be but one capable of also showing the children the joys of life. Mary Poppins suffers mainly from the same thing that I feel plagues most musicals - it's too long. Seemingly every musical feels the need to round-up every change of emotion and sub-plot with a grand song-and- dance number that gets old quickly. The first half of the film is pure family entertainment, with memorable songs and some stunning special effects (for its day) making the film zip by happily. Then the songs get more clunky and forgettable, and we are exposed to much more of Dick Van Dyke's terrible accent and his grating, over-enthusiastic Bert than we need (although I'm sure he has his many fans). Yet after the somewhat exhausting 139 minutes is over, Poppins still leaves you with that cuddly feeling inside, something I thought had died inside me when I sprouted my first pube. Most of the success of Poppins comes from the performance of Julie Andrews. All sweet and idyllic, she could have come across as a stuck-up Miss Perfect, but Andrews' effortless likability and stage experience makes her more of a supernatural missionary, sent to make a stand against Mr. Banks' stern and rigid outlook on life. Disney were really coming out of their Golden Era at the time of this being released, but it's still one of their most fondly remembered, and certainly their most critically successful live-action efforts. It's more than likely that children will turn away from it, due to the mega-bucks spewed into children's films these days, but it will continue to enchant adults, especially those that grew up with it, and even those new to it, like me. Chim-chimernee, chim-ernee, chim chim, cheroo! Damn it, it's in my head again!

    Even as a 9-year-old in 1965, I knew that this movie was awful. Julie Andrews was all wrong for the part of Mary Poppins, and the animation was flawed and cheesy. The book's author, P.L. Travers, soon regretted collaborating with Disney on this project. She begged him to leave out the animation, and cast someone more appropriate in the title role. Disney, the bastard, turned on his heel and said "Pamela, that ship has sailed." He refused to make any of the changes back to her original book. The result was a horrible adaptation that Travers was bitter about until the day she died. Disney was a nasty piece of work. "Alice in Wonderland" was another story he ruined. Rot in hell, Mr. Disney!

    I first saw this film over 20 years ago back in the days when they had the video player, this is a film I liked better when I got older. This film is about Mary Poppins being a Nanny to two children Jane and Michael (played by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) after the nanny leaves because the kids had ran away. There are good songs in this, my favourite songs has to be 'I Love To Laugh' and 'Feed The Bird. My favourite scenes are Mary Poppins singing Feed The Birds and A Spoonful Of Sugar. When I was younger I found the scene when the old man from the bank (played by Dick Van Dyke) dying laughing disturbing but it doesn't bother me much now I am older.

    and it is enough. because its charm is fresh. its songs - adorable. its science to transform a book in a fairy - tale, with each regular ingredient at perfect place, with cartoons, good actors and slices of extraordinary adventures is a great virtue. a classic. but in a form very special. because its message is more important today. the nice special effects, the shining Julie Andrews, the performance of children and, in same time, the music. a magic film about magic and seed for a wave, not exactly small of films about powerful/seductive nannies. so, must see it again ! because it is not only a beautiful film or a wise story. it is a gift. and heart for state of spirit.

They are warm, nostalgia, and thoroughly convincing. The animated sequence is fun too, with the waiter penguins being the best part of that whole adventure This is Walt Disney's best film, and was hailed as such when it premiered in August 1964. His fingerprints were all over this film too, as he made really good contributions to the story and characters (he was the one who made the animated waiters Penguins, Brilliant!) The reviews and box office numbers were all outstanding. Then it was nominated for a staggering 13 Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and won 5 Oscars, including Best Actress for Julie Andrews. Regrettably it did not win Best Picture, but it still has endured forever in the hearts and minds of children and adults who have seen it. Like the title of my review suggests, this is one of my all time favorite movies. And this is one of the films that inspired my interest in filmmaking, and one I will always look to with affection. I will be watching this many more times, and never get tired of it.

    Walt Disney was one of the most iconic figures of the twentieth century. He left a legacy behind filled with classic, unforgettable films like "Show White," "Sleeping Beauty" and "101 Dalmatians." With "Mary Poppins," however, he reached his zenith and produced perhaps the greatest musical ever made, a beautiful film for both adults and children. While the movie doesn't exactly do justice to the wonderful P.L. Travers' books, its originality and charm is as magical as Mary Poppins herself. Julie Andrews is perfect for the title role; pretty but cold and firm. Dick Van Dyke really shines here as Bert the chimney sweep; it's perhaps the only time he was allowed to display the full extent of his prodigious talents. Andrews and Van Dyke clearly have a great chemistry together. Disney filled "Mary Poppins" with top notch character actors, like Reta Shaw, Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher and Ed Wynn. Reginald Owen is a treat as Admiral Boom, along with Jane Darwell as the old lady behind one of the many unforgettable songs in the film, "Feed The Birds." Glynis Johns is cute as a very innocent suffragette, and David Tomlinson plays the role of distracted father/crusty banker to the hilt. But it's the songs that really make "Mary Poppins" so special. Every Baby Boomer knows them by heart; my personal favorite is the soaring (no pun intended), "Let's Go Fly A Kite." The film deserved all the accolades and praise it earned, and it remains one of the finest films in motion picture history.

    I have to admit that it's rather miraculous that I am able to remember a few of the first movies that I've ever seen as a child. I am able to recall seeing Disney films like Cinderella (1950) and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) for the first time at a very early age. So it's no surprise that I'm still able to recall seeing Mary Poppins (1964) for the first time at a young age and remembering how special an experience it was. What makes it all the more memorable is that I still enjoy Mary Poppins looking back at it as an adult just as much as I did when I saw it as a kid. In my opinion, that's the key ingredient regarding what makes a children's film timeless in the first place. We follow an unhappy British family led by Mr. and Mrs. Banks (David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns respectively) during the 1910s that are looking to hire a new nanny after their most recent one (Elsa Lanchester) quit. What they get is a magical nanny by the name of Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews in her amazing, Oscar-winning theatrical debut) who changes the entire family's lives forever. The kids (Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber) are taken on adventures beyond their wildest dreams such as jumping into chalk drawings, cleaning their room with the snap of their fingers, and other similar outings which are more magical than they sound. Joining with them on their adventures is an upbeat jack-of- all-trades by the name of Bert (Dick Van Dyke in a highly joyful role). This film basically covers Mary's time with the family until the "wind changes direction", both literally and metaphorically. What is fascinating about the story for this family film is that it teaches lessons not only to children, but also to adults. In its own unique way, it basically tells every family to meet in the middle between what the children expect from their parents and what the parents expect from their children. That means that parents should be more understanding of their children's playfulness and children should only have so much of a good thing. That's exactly the type of family dynamic that Mary Poppins tries to teach the entire Banks family through her own mysterious yet somehow wise actions. It is a profound and meaningful dynamic for any family to learn and strive for, and it's one crucial reason why Mary Poppins is still an original and unique family picture almost 50 years since it first came out. But of course, it isn't the only reason why I still love Mary Poppins now. Looking back at it again, I just picked up on how funny, witty and charming this movie really is. At times, the humor bares comparison with some of the greatest comedies of the 20th century like Duck Soup (1933) and Modern Times (1936). Other times, I was displaying an affectionate smile either for the terrific lines of dialogue made possible by writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi or recalling just how cool and charming every scene is. Remember the scene with Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) floating up in the air because he's laughing so hard? Remember the chimney sweeps (including Bert) doing some dangerous dancing on the rooftops? This film contains just one great scene after another and at a running time of more than 2 hours, it all moves exceedingly well. If that isn't a compliment to Walt Disney's master storytelling, I don't know what is. I briefly mentioned earlier that this was Julie Andrews' acting debut as the main character Mary Poppins and considering that she won an Oscar for her first performance, it's an impressive way to start out her career. Between her superb singing skills, her comfort in the role, and her overall excellent delivery, I can definitely see why she earned the Oscar. I know Dick Van Dyke has received criticism for his British accent, but to be brutally honest, I never saw the problem because I don't know anything about true Cockney accents. I honestly loved Dick Van Dyke in this movie regardless. I thought he had charm and wit to spare, he worked very well with the kids, he always had a positive attitude, he was highly entertaining overall. Even David Tomlinson is outstanding as Mr. Banks. For me, this is the strict parental figure done right. He may be able to tolerate the playfulness of his children for a very limited time, but the filmmakers still made a likable character out of him and somehow make his stubbornness funny. I think we all know how great the music and songs written by Richard and Robert Sherman are here. We all remember the song "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and the meaning of that unorthodox word. It's practically a word that's used when there's nothing else to say, and there's nothing else I can say about that word except..the word. How do you like that? There's a reason why this film is one of the only 2 Disney movies to be on the list of the AFI's 25 Greatest Musicals. The fact that it's filled with timeless songs such as "A Spoonful of Sugar", "I Love to Laugh" and the Oscar-winning "Chim Chim Cheree" should explain enough. They're cheerful, they're memorable, they're catchy, the songs and music are basically everything you could ask for from a musical. Mary Poppins easily takes its place amongst the finest films that Disney has ever put out. The story flows very well at 139 minutes and the fact that it moves more efficiently than most films of that running time is further proof of Mr. Disney's master skills as a storyteller. The music, the acting, the characters, the writing and even some of the special effects all come together in a wonderful family film that is "practically perfect in every way".

    Just for a moment, think of all those movies about monsters and manifestations of evil. There is the creature in Alien, the machine in Terminator, Predator and the various zombie movies, blood sucking vampire movies, movies with representations of the devil in various forms, including Al Pacino, and all the other incarnate creatures of hell. Have you ever wondered why all the creatures of supposed evil are so ghastly, armed with sharp teeth, claws and mouths that emit flames? Why do they require this weaponry? You understand why when you look at their opponents; they have to take on the likes of Mary Poppins. Mary Poppins is essentially a white witch. And she is awesomely powerful. Every time I watch a clip of "A Spoon Full Of Sugar" it sends shivers up my spine and makes me realise just how seriously omnipotent this lady is. If Mary Poppins was offended by the behaviour of Alien, Predator, Al Pacino's devil and the fury of the Incredible Hulk all at the same time, she would have them wearing nappies and a bib with a click of her fingers. Mary Poppins is God's white Protestant representative on planet Earth and is armed with all the tools to dispatch harmony on our poor souls. Unfortunately it is only a movie. Mary Poppins is a character every child needs to be able to call upon. Rather her than Santa Claus.

    I'd like to think that I've seen a lot of movies, of varying quality and genre; enough to believe I have at least a basic grasp of cinema as a whole. But during all the classics and tripe I've endured over the years, Mary Poppins has somehow managed to evade me. I was too busy watching rabbits getting torn to pieces in Watership Down (1978) and clapping giddily at Rocky Balboa's training montage in Rocky (1976) as a child to be distracted by something quite as colourful as this. So, it's at the ripe old age of 28 that I came round to sitting through Mary Poppins, to struggle through its squeaky-clean visage and many, many songs that I somehow knew all the words to before seeing the film. Well, I was wrong to be so cynical, as although the film is hardly what I would call a classic, it's really rather good. London, 1910. Merry jack-of-all-trades Bert (Dick Van Dyke) is playing a one-man-band to an enthusiastic street audience when he senses something magical in the air, signalling the return of his good friend Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews). He takes us into the stable yet unhappy Banks' family home, where the household is ran by lord-of-his-castle Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson), and his suffragette wife Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns). Busy attending to work and other matters, the Banks' have started to neglect their children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber). After their umpteenth nanny walks out on them, Mr. Banks makes a desperate newspaper plea for a nanny who will lay down the law, and teach the children respect and the harshness of life. So enters Mary Poppins, 'perfect in every way', a nanny who is as strict as she needs to be but one capable of also showing the children the joys of life. Mary Poppins suffers mainly from the same thing that I feel plagues most musicals - it's too long. Seemingly every musical feels the need to round-up every change of emotion and sub-plot with a grand song-and- dance number that gets old quickly. The first half of the film is pure family entertainment, with memorable songs and some stunning special effects (for its day) making the film zip by happily. Then the songs get more clunky and forgettable, and we are exposed to much more of Dick Van Dyke's terrible accent and his grating, over-enthusiastic Bert than we need (although I'm sure he has his many fans). Yet after the somewhat exhausting 139 minutes is over, Poppins still leaves you with that cuddly feeling inside, something I thought had died inside me when I sprouted my first pube. Most of the success of Poppins comes from the performance of Julie Andrews. All sweet and idyllic, she could have come across as a stuck-up Miss Perfect, but Andrews' effortless likability and stage experience makes her more of a supernatural missionary, sent to make a stand against Mr. Banks' stern and rigid outlook on life. Disney were really coming out of their Golden Era at the time of this being released, but it's still one of their most fondly remembered, and certainly their most critically successful live-action efforts. It's more than likely that children will turn away from it, due to the mega-bucks spewed into children's films these days, but it will continue to enchant adults, especially those that grew up with it, and even those new to it, like me. Chim-chimernee, chim-ernee, chim chim, cheroo! Damn it, it's in my head again!

    Even as a 9-year-old in 1965, I knew that this movie was awful. Julie Andrews was all wrong for the part of Mary Poppins, and the animation was flawed and cheesy. The book's author, P.L. Travers, soon regretted collaborating with Disney on this project. She begged him to leave out the animation, and cast someone more appropriate in the title role. Disney, the bastard, turned on his heel and said "Pamela, that ship has sailed." He refused to make any of the changes back to her original book. The result was a horrible adaptation that Travers was bitter about until the day she died. Disney was a nasty piece of work. "Alice in Wonderland" was another story he ruined. Rot in hell, Mr. Disney!

    I first saw this film over 20 years ago back in the days when they had the video player, this is a film I liked better when I got older. This film is about Mary Poppins being a Nanny to two children Jane and Michael (played by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) after the nanny leaves because the kids had ran away. There are good songs in this, my favourite songs has to be 'I Love To Laugh' and 'Feed The Bird. My favourite scenes are Mary Poppins singing Feed The Birds and A Spoonful Of Sugar. When I was younger I found the scene when the old man from the bank (played by Dick Van Dyke) dying laughing disturbing but it doesn't bother me much now I am older.

    and it is enough. because its charm is fresh. its songs - adorable. its science to transform a book in a fairy - tale, with each regular ingredient at perfect place, with cartoons, good actors and slices of extraordinary adventures is a great virtue. a classic. but in a form very special. because its message is more important today. the nice special effects, the shining Julie Andrews, the performance of children and, in same time, the music. a magic film about magic and seed for a wave, not exactly small of films about powerful/seductive nannies. so, must see it again ! because it is not only a beautiful film or a wise story. it is a gift. and heart for state of spirit.

    I Watched this movie on GO and online but mostly on DVD. I did not get the point of the movie because it was all mixed and not that entertaining, however the music was perfect and a spoonful of sugar ha ha. One of the most cool thing in this movie was how you get to feel the wonders and thoughts in the characters minds and hearts which was truly mad and fun. Another Its a very long movie with lots of colours and funny graphics, however it did not have any movie texture or any scenes which didn't have utter nonsense. I would recommend this movie to people whom love and admire magical tales and flying in the air blah blah.

    I always wanted to see Mary Poppins as the idea of a magical nanny really appealed to me and I have to admit that the animation is pretty amazing for its time but the story is usually what interests me most and the problem I had is that I watched this movie after I'd seen Nanny McPhee. I thought it would be an original story with great songs. I already loved the 'Spoon full of sugar'-song and the Supercallifragi-song as I had lots of Disney CD's before I watched the movie. So I convinced two people to watch it together with me as it's a classic. And we were about halfway when everybody looked at each other and said: "Do you still like this?" And we all had to admit we were really annoyed, not only bored but actually annoyed with the story. Sure there is lots of potential in a story about a magical nanny! And still, there is no real story, no story that keeps you tied to the screen anyway. We sat through the whole movie (again, because it's a classic) but we all didn't really enjoy it. I was actually bothered by a few questions afterwards: Why is that stupid Dick Van Dyke-character in this movie? Why put all these chimney sweepers and distract us from the really interesting character (or you would expect so anyway): Mary Poppins. It's the title of the movie! Why not focus on all the magical things she can do and will do to help educate and bring up the children? There must be more than magical room-cleaning... What annoyed me most was the 'Jolly holly day with Mary'-song which went on and on and on. Every time I thought the stupid song was over, it started again and it just put the story on hold. Sadly enough, this movie was made back in those days when musical songs did not yet carry the story and unraveled extra plot elements but when songs were a detour. And what are penguins doing in this movie anyway? It's like they wanted to show off with what they were able to do at the expense of the story. So I hate to say this as I'm a big Disney fan! (But that doesn't mean I'll blindly love every single one of the movies) I really didn't like Mary Poppins. Give it a shot. Maybe you will... but I sure didn't. One day, I'd like to give it another shot but not for at least ten years. I'd probably like Nanny McPhee turned into animation but Mary Poppins is just not for me...

    Mary Poppins is one of those films that works on every level its been given. This was the film that Walt Disney dedicated most of his life and career to get made. He and his exceptional team of geniuses lifted the characters and some story from P.L. Traver's "good" book and transformed it into something that will stand the test of time. The story is about the dysfunctional Banks family in Edwardian London. The children Jane and Michael are rambunctious and keep annoying nannies out of the house. The parents, George and Winifred, are good people but are way too focused on their profession and causes to notice that the kids just want their love. Then comes Mary Poppins on her flying umbrella. She is a sweet but still stern lady who takes the kids on these whimsical adventures and sings catchy songs. But she's there for more than that (something way deeper), she is there to help mend the broken family. What makes great characters is a great cast, and that movie has it all. Julie Andrews (in her film debut) gives one of the best heroines ever put to screen. She is "prctically perfect in every way." Dick Van Dyke gives a very funny and at times touching performance as her jack-of-all-trades cockney companion Bert. David Tomlinson gives possibly one of my favorite performances in any movie as Mr. Banks. You see his journey over the course of the film and the moment is beautiful when he realizes that his kids and his wife are more important than what his bosses (played memorably by Arthur Malet and Dick van Dyke in heavy makeup) at the bank tell him and what he thought was important. And Glynis Johns gives a funny performance as the chipper suffragette Mrs. Banks. The story and score are something to behold. This is one of the best thought out of any Disney movie before or since (except Beauty and the Beast) Writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi concocted a story full of whimsy, sweetness, and surprisingly, very good drama. And then the Sherman Brother's score adds to the timeless quality of the film. There are showstoppers ("Supercalifragilistiexpialidocious" and "A Spoonful of Sugar") but the ones I like are either subtle or just fun to watch and listen to, "Step in Time, "A Man has Dreams," and the best song of the movie "Feed the Birds" (which features a great cameo by the great Jane Darwell) The song gives away Mary Poppins' message, which is that the small things in life are important, and family love is the ultimate gift for any person young or old. The man who also held this all together and mixed them in a beautiful way was long time Disney director Robert Stevenson, knowing just when to blend lightness and whimsy with pathos and drama. Then there are the special effects. This is one of the first movies I saw where I was blown away (even as a little kid) because i thought it was all real. It's one of those films that uses special effects to tell the story, not to distract the viewer. Nowhere is this more evident than artist Peter Ellenshaw's masterpiece matte paintings. They are warm, nostalgia, and thoroughly convincing.

    Just for a moment, think of all those movies about monsters and manifestations of evil. There is the creature in Alien, the machine in Terminator, Predator and the various zombie movies, blood sucking vampire movies, movies with representations of the devil in various forms, including Al Pacino, and all the other incarnate creatures of hell. Have you ever wondered why all the creatures of supposed evil are so ghastly, armed with sharp teeth, claws and mouths that emit flames? Why do they require this weaponry? You understand why when you look at their opponents; they have to take on the likes of Mary Poppins. Mary Poppins is essentially a white witch. And she is awesomely powerful. Every time I watch a clip of "A Spoon Full Of Sugar" it sends shivers up my spine and makes me realise just how seriously omnipotent this lady is. If Mary Poppins was offended by the behaviour of Alien, Predator, Al Pacino's devil and the fury of the Incredible Hulk all at the same time, she would have them wearing nappies and a bib with a click of her fingers. Mary Poppins is God's white Protestant representative on planet Earth and is armed with all the tools to dispatch harmony on our poor souls. Unfortunately it is only a movie. Mary Poppins is a character every child needs to be able to call upon. Rather her than Santa Claus.

    I'd like to think that I've seen a lot of movies, of varying quality and genre; enough to believe I have at least a basic grasp of cinema as a whole. But during all the classics and tripe I've endured over the years, Mary Poppins has somehow managed to evade me. I was too busy watching rabbits getting torn to pieces in Watership Down (1978) and clapping giddily at Rocky Balboa's training montage in Rocky (1976) as a child to be distracted by something quite as colourful as this. So, it's at the ripe old age of 28 that I came round to sitting through Mary Poppins, to struggle through its squeaky-clean visage and many, many songs that I somehow knew all the words to before seeing the film. Well, I was wrong to be so cynical, as although the film is hardly what I would call a classic, it's really rather good. London, 1910. Merry jack-of-all-trades Bert (Dick Van Dyke) is playing a one-man-band to an enthusiastic street audience when he senses something magical in the air, signalling the return of his good friend Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews). He takes us into the stable yet unhappy Banks' family home, where the household is ran by lord-of-his-castle Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson), and his suffragette wife Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns). Busy attending to work and other matters, the Banks' have started to neglect their children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber). After their umpteenth nanny walks out on them, Mr. Banks makes a desperate newspaper plea for a nanny who will lay down the law, and teach the children respect and the harshness of life. So enters Mary Poppins, 'perfect in every way', a nanny who is as strict as she needs to be but one capable of also showing the children the joys of life. Mary Poppins suffers mainly from the same thing that I feel plagues most musicals - it's too long. Seemingly every musical feels the need to round-up every change of emotion and sub-plot with a grand song-and- dance number that gets old quickly. The first half of the film is pure family entertainment, with memorable songs and some stunning special effects (for its day) making the film zip by happily. Then the songs get more clunky and forgettable, and we are exposed to much more of Dick Van Dyke's terrible accent and his grating, over-enthusiastic Bert than we need (although I'm sure he has his many fans). Yet after the somewhat exhausting 139 minutes is over, Poppins still leaves you with that cuddly feeling inside, something I thought had died inside me when I sprouted my first pube. Most of the success of Poppins comes from the performance of Julie Andrews. All sweet and idyllic, she could have come across as a stuck-up Miss Perfect, but Andrews' effortless likability and stage experience makes her more of a supernatural missionary, sent to make a stand against Mr. Banks' stern and rigid outlook on life. Disney were really coming out of their Golden Era at the time of this being released, but it's still one of their most fondly remembered, and certainly their most critically successful live-action efforts. It's more than likely that children will turn away from it, due to the mega-bucks spewed into children's films these days, but it will continue to enchant adults, especially those that grew up with it, and even those new to it, like me. Chim-chimernee, chim-ernee, chim chim, cheroo! Damn it, it's in my head again!

    Even as a 9-year-old in 1965, I knew that this movie was awful. Julie Andrews was all wrong for the part of Mary Poppins, and the animation was flawed and cheesy. The book's author, P.L. Travers, soon regretted collaborating with Disney on this project. She begged him to leave out the animation, and cast someone more appropriate in the title role. Disney, the bastard, turned on his heel and said "Pamela, that ship has sailed." He refused to make any of the changes back to her original book. The result was a horrible adaptation that Travers was bitter about until the day she died. Disney was a nasty piece of work. "Alice in Wonderland" was another story he ruined.

    I first saw this film over 20 years ago back in the days when they had the video player, this is a film I liked better when I got older. This film is about Mary Poppins being a Nanny to two children Jane and Michael (played by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) after the nanny leaves because the kids had ran away. There are good songs in this, my favourite songs has to be 'I Love To Laugh' and 'Feed The Bird. My favourite scenes are Mary Poppins singing Feed The Birds and A Spoonful Of Sugar. When I was younger I found the scene when the old man from the bank (played by Dick Van Dyke) dying laughing disturbing but it doesn't bother me much now I am older.

    and it is enough. because its charm is fresh. its songs - adorable. its science to transform a book in a fairy - tale, with each regular ingredient at perfect place, with cartoons, good actors and slices of extraordinary adventures is a great virtue. a classic. but in a form very special. because its message is more important today. the nice special effects, the shining Julie Andrews, the performance of children and, in same time, the music. a magic film about magic and seed for a wave, not exactly small of films about powerful/seductive nannies. so, must see it again ! because it is not only a beautiful film or a wise story. it is a gift. and heart for state of spirit.

    I Watched this movie on GO and online but mostly on DVD. I did not get the point of the movie because it was all mixed and not that entertaining, however the music was perfect and a spoonful of sugar ha ha. One of the most cool thing in this movie was how you get to feel the wonders and thoughts in the characters minds and hearts which was truly mad and fun. Another Its a very long movie with lots of colours and funny graphics, however it did not have any movie texture or any scenes which didn't have utter nonsense. I would recommend this movie to people whom love and admire magical tales and flying in the air blah blah.

    I always wanted to see Mary Poppins as the idea of a magical nanny really appealed to me and I have to admit that the animation is pretty amazing for its time but the story is usually what interests me most and the problem I had is that I watched this movie after I'd seen Nanny McPhee. I thought it would be an original story with great songs. I already loved the 'Spoon full of sugar'-song and the Supercallifragi-song as I had lots of Disney CD's before I watched the movie. So I convinced two people to watch it together with me as it's a classic. And we were about halfway when everybody looked at each other and said: "Do you still like this?" And we all had to admit we were really annoyed, not only bored but actually annoyed with the story. Sure there is lots of potential in a story about a magical nanny! And still, there is no real story, no story that keeps you tied to the screen anyway. We sat through the whole movie (again, because it's a classic) but we all didn't really enjoy it. I was actually bothered by a few questions afterwards: Why is that stupid Dick Van Dyke-character in this movie? Why put all these chimney sweepers and distract us from the really interesting character (or you would expect so anyway): Mary Poppins. It's the title of the movie! Why not focus on all the magical things she can do and will do to help educate and bring up the children? There must be more than magical room-cleaning... What annoyed me most was the 'Jolly holly day with Mary'-song which went on and on and on. Every time I thought the stupid song was over, it started again and it just put the story on hold. Sadly enough, this movie was made back in those days when musical songs did not yet carry the story and unraveled extra plot elements but when songs were a detour. And what are penguins doing in this movie anyway? It's like they wanted to show off with what they were able to do at the expense of the story. So I hate to say this as I'm a big Disney fan! (But that doesn't mean I'll blindly love every single one of the movies) I really didn't like Mary Poppins. Give it a shot. Maybe you will... but I sure didn't. One day, I'd like to give it another shot but not for at least ten years. I'd probably like Nanny McPhee turned into animation but Mary Poppins is just not for me...

    Mary Poppins is one of those films that works on every level its been given. This was the film that Walt Disney dedicated most of his life and career to get made. He and his exceptional team of geniuses lifted the characters and some story from P.L. Traver's "good" book and transformed it into something that will stand the test of time. The story is about the dysfunctional Banks family in Edwardian London. The children Jane and Michael are rambunctious and keep annoying nannies out of the house. The parents, George and Winifred, are good people but are way too focused on their profession and causes to notice that the kids just want their love. Then comes Mary Poppins on her flying umbrella. She is a sweet but still stern lady who takes the kids on these whimsical adventures and sings catchy songs. But she's there for more than that (something way deeper), she is there to help mend the broken family. What makes great characters is a great cast, and that movie has it all. Julie Andrews (in her film debut) gives one of the best heroines ever put to screen. She is "prctically perfect in every way." Dick Van Dyke gives a very funny and at times touching performance as her jack-of-all-trades cockney companion Bert. David Tomlinson gives possibly one of my favorite performances in any movie as Mr. Banks. You see his journey over the course of the film and the moment is beautiful when he realizes that his kids and his wife are more important than what his bosses (played memorably by Arthur Malet and Dick van Dyke in heavy makeup) at the bank tell him and what he thought was important. And Glynis Johns gives a funny performance as the chipper suffragette Mrs. Banks. The story and score are something to behold. This is one of the best thought out of any Disney movie before or since (except Beauty and the Beast) Writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi concocted a story full of whimsy, sweetness, and surprisingly, very good drama. And then the Sherman Brother's score adds to the timeless quality of the film. There are showstoppers ("Supercalifragilistiexpialidocious" and "A Spoonful of Sugar") but the ones I like are either subtle or just fun to watch and listen to, "Step in Time, "A Man has Dreams," and the best song of the movie "Feed the Birds" (which features a great cameo by the great Jane Darwell) The song gives away Mary Poppins' message, which is that the small things in life are important, and family love is the ultimate gift for any person young or old. The man who also held this all together and mixed them in a beautiful way was long time Disney director Robert Stevenson, knowing just when to blend lightness and whimsy with pathos and drama. Then there are the special effects. This is one of the first movies I saw where I was blown away (even as a little kid) because i thought it was all real. It's one of those films that uses special effects to tell the story, not to distract the viewer. Nowhere is this more evident than artist Peter Ellenshaw's masterpiece matte paintings. They are warm, nostalgia, and thoroughly convincing. The animated sequence is fun too, with the waiter penguins being the best part of that whole adventure This is Walt Disney's best film, and was hailed as such when it premiered in August 1964. His fingerprints were all over this film too, as he made really good contributions to the story and characters (he was the one who made the animated waiters Penguins, Brilliant!) The reviews and box office numbers were all outstanding. Then it was nominated for a staggering 13 Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and won 5 Oscars, including Best Actress for Julie Andrews. Regrettably it did not win Best Picture, but it still has endured forever in the hearts and minds of children and adults who have seen it. Like the title of my review suggests, this is one of my all time favorite movies. And this is one of the films that inspired my interest in filmmaking, and one I will always look to with affection. I will be watching this many more times, and never get tired of it.

    Walt Disney was one of the most iconic figures of the twentieth century. He left a legacy behind filled with classic, unforgettable films like "Show White," "Sleeping Beauty" and "101 Dalmatians." With "Mary Poppins," however, he reached his zenith and produced perhaps the greatest musical ever made, a beautiful film for both adults and children. While the movie doesn't exactly do justice to the wonderful P.L. Travers' books, its originality and charm is as magical as Mary Poppins herself. Julie Andrews is perfect for the title role; pretty but cold and firm. Dick Van Dyke really shines here as Bert the chimney sweep; it's perhaps the only time he was allowed to display the full extent of his prodigious talents. Andrews and Van Dyke clearly have a great chemistry together. Disney filled "Mary Poppins" with top notch character actors, like Reta Shaw, Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher and Ed Wynn. Reginald Owen is a treat as Admiral Boom, along with Jane Darwell as the old lady behind one of the many unforgettable songs in the film, "Feed The Birds." Glynis Johns is cute as a very innocent suffragette, and David Tomlinson plays the role of distracted father/crusty banker to the hilt. But it's the songs that really make "Mary Poppins" so special. Every Baby Boomer knows them by heart; my personal favorite is the soaring (no pun intended), "Let's Go Fly A Kite." The film deserved all the accolades and praise it earned, and it remains one of the finest films in motion picture history.

    I have to admit that it's rather miraculous that I am able to remember a few of the first movies that I've ever seen as a child. I am able to recall seeing Disney films like Cinderella (1950) and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) for the first time at a very early age. So it's no surprise that I'm still able to recall seeing Mary Poppins (1964) for the first time at a young age and remembering how special an experience it was. What makes it all the more memorable is that I still enjoy Mary Poppins looking back at it as an adult just as much as I did when I saw it as a kid. In my opinion, that's the key ingredient regarding what makes a children's film timeless in the first place. We follow an unhappy British family led by Mr. and Mrs. Banks (David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns respectively) during the 1910s that are looking to hire a new nanny after their most recent one (Elsa Lanchester) quit. What they get is a magical nanny by the name of Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews in her amazing, Oscar-winning theatrical debut) who changes the entire family's lives forever. The kids (Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber) are taken on adventures beyond their wildest dreams such as jumping into chalk drawings, cleaning their room with the snap of their fingers, and other similar outings which are more magical than they sound. Joining with them on their adventures is an upbeat jack-of- all-trades by the name of Bert (Dick Van Dyke in a highly joyful role). This film basically covers Mary's time with the family until the "wind changes direction", both literally and metaphorically. What is fascinating about the story for this family film is that it teaches lessons not only to children, but also to adults. In its own unique way, it basically tells every family to meet in the middle between what the children expect from their parents and what the parents expect from their children. That means that parents should be more understanding of their children's playfulness and children should only have so much of a good thing. That's exactly the type of family dynamic that Mary Poppins tries to teach the entire Banks family through her own mysterious yet somehow wise actions. It is a profound and meaningful dynamic for any family to learn and strive for, and it's one crucial reason why Mary Poppins is still an original and unique family picture almost 50 years since it first came out. But of course, it isn't the only reason why I still love Mary Poppins now. Looking back at it again, I just picked up on how funny, witty and charming this movie really is. At times, the humor bares comparison with some of the greatest comedies of the 20th century like Duck Soup (1933) and Modern Times (1936). Other times, I was displaying an affectionate smile either for the terrific lines of dialogue made possible by writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi or recalling just how cool and charming every scene is. Remember the scene with Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) floating up in the air because he's laughing so hard? Remember the chimney sweeps (including Bert) doing some dangerous dancing on the rooftops? This film contains just one great scene after another and at a running time of more than 2 hours, it all moves exceedingly well. If that isn't a compliment to Walt Disney's master storytelling, I don't know what is. I briefly mentioned earlier that this was Julie Andrews' acting debut as the main character Mary Poppins and considering that she won an Oscar for her first performance, it's an impressive way to start out her career. Between her superb singing skills, her comfort in the role, and her overall excellent delivery, I can definitely see why she earned the Oscar. I know Dick Van Dyke has received criticism for his British accent, but to be brutally honest, I never saw the problem because I don't know anything about true Cockney accents. I honestly loved Dick Van Dyke in this movie regardless. I thought he had charm and wit to spare, he worked very well with the kids, he always had a positive attitude, he was highly entertaining overall. Even David Tomlinson is outstanding as Mr. Banks. For me, this is the strict parental figure done right. He may be able to tolerate the playfulness of his children for a very limited time, but the filmmakers still made a likable character out of him and somehow make his stubbornness funny. I think we all know how great the music and songs written by Richard and Robert Sherman are here. We all remember the song "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and the meaning of that unorthodox word. It's practically a word that's used when there's nothing else to say, and there's nothing else I can say about that word except..the word. How do you like that? There's a reason why this film is one of the only 2 Disney movies to be on the list of the AFI's 25 Greatest Musicals. The fact that it's filled with timeless songs such as "A Spoonful of Sugar", "I Love to Laugh" and the Oscar-winning "Chim Chim Cheree" should explain enough. They're cheerful, they're memorable, they're catchy, the songs and music are basically everything you could ask for from a musical. Mary Poppins easily takes its place amongst the finest films that Disney has ever put out. The story flows very well at 139 minutes and the fact that it moves more efficiently than most films of that running time is further proof of Mr. Disney's master skills as a storyteller. The music, the acting, the characters, the writing and even some of the special effects all come together in a wonderful family film that is "practically perfect in every way".

I did not get the point of the movie because it was all mixed and not that entertaining, however the music was perfect and a spoonful of sugar ha ha. One of the most cool thing in this movie was how you get to feel the wonders and thoughts in the characters minds and hearts which was truly mad and fun. Another Its a very long movie with lots of colours and funny graphics, however it did not have any movie texture or any scenes which didn't have utter nonsense. I would recommend this movie to people whom love and admire magical tales and flying in the air blah blah.

    I always wanted to see Mary Poppins as the idea of a magical nanny really appealed to me and I have to admit that the animation is pretty amazing for its time but the story is usually what interests me most and the problem I had is that I watched this movie after I'd seen Nanny McPhee. I thought it would be an original story with great songs. I already loved the 'Spoon full of sugar'-song and the Supercallifragi-song as I had lots of Disney CD's before I watched the movie. So I convinced two people to watch it together with me as it's a classic. And we were about halfway when everybody looked at each other and said: "Do you still like this?" And we all had to admit we were really annoyed, not only bored but actually annoyed with the story. Sure there is lots of potential in a story about a magical nanny! And still, there is no real story, no story that keeps you tied to the screen anyway. We sat through the whole movie (again, because it's a classic) but we all didn't really enjoy it. I was actually bothered by a few questions afterwards: Why is that stupid Dick Van Dyke-character in this movie? Why put all these chimney sweepers and distract us from the really interesting character (or you would expect so anyway): Mary Poppins. It's the title of the movie! Why not focus on all the magical things she can do and will do to help educate and bring up the children? There must be more than magical room-cleaning... What annoyed me most was the 'Jolly holly day with Mary'-song which went on and on and on. Every time I thought the stupid song was over, it started again and it just put the story on hold. Sadly enough, this movie was made back in those days when musical songs did not yet carry the story and unraveled extra plot elements but when songs were a detour. And what are penguins doing in this movie anyway? It's like they wanted to show off with what they were able to do at the expense of the story. So I hate to say this as I'm a big Disney fan! (But that doesn't mean I'll blindly love every single one of the movies) I really didn't like Mary Poppins. Give it a shot. Maybe you will... but I sure didn't. One day, I'd like to give it another shot but not for at least ten years. I'd probably like Nanny McPhee turned into animation but Mary Poppins is just not for me...

    Mary Poppins is one of those films that works on every level its been given. This was the film that Walt Disney dedicated most of his life and career to get made. He and his exceptional team of geniuses lifted the characters and some story from P.L. Traver's "good" book and transformed it into something that will stand the test of time. The story is about the dysfunctional Banks family in Edwardian London. The children Jane and Michael are rambunctious and keep annoying nannies out of the house. The parents, George and Winifred, are good people but are way too focused on their profession and causes to notice that the kids just want their love. Then comes Mary Poppins on her flying umbrella. She is a sweet but still stern lady who takes the kids on these whimsical adventures and sings catchy songs. But she's there for more than that (something way deeper), she is there to help mend the broken family. What makes great characters is a great cast, and that movie has it all. Julie Andrews (in her film debut) gives one of the best heroines ever put to screen. She is "prctically perfect in every way." Dick Van Dyke gives a very funny and at times touching performance as her jack-of-all-trades cockney companion Bert. David Tomlinson gives possibly one of my favorite performances in any movie as Mr. Banks. You see his journey over the course of the film and the moment is beautiful when he realizes that his kids and his wife are more important than what his bosses (played memorably by Arthur Malet and Dick van Dyke in heavy makeup) at the bank tell him and what he thought was important. And Glynis Johns gives a funny performance as the chipper suffragette Mrs. Banks. The story and score are something to behold. This is one of the best thought out of any Disney movie before or since (except Beauty and the Beast) Writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi concocted a story full of whimsy, sweetness, and surprisingly, very good drama. And then the Sherman Brother's score adds to the timeless quality of the film. There are showstoppers ("Supercalifragilistiexpialidocious" and "A Spoonful of Sugar") but the ones I like are either subtle or just fun to watch and listen to, "Step in Time, "A Man has Dreams," and the best song of the movie "Feed the Birds" (which features a great cameo by the great Jane Darwell) The song gives away Mary Poppins' message, which is that the small things in life are important, and family love is the ultimate gift for any person young or old. The man who also held this all together and mixed them in a beautiful way was long time Disney director Robert Stevenson, knowing just when to blend lightness and whimsy with pathos and drama. Then there are the special effects. This is one of the first movies I saw where I was blown away (even as a little kid) because i thought it was all real. It's one of those films that uses special effects to tell the story, not to distract the viewer. Nowhere is this more evident than artist Peter Ellenshaw's masterpiece matte paintings. They are warm, nostalgia, and thoroughly convincing. The animated sequence is fun too, with the waiter penguins being the best part of that whole adventure This is Walt Disney's best film, and was hailed as such when it premiered in August 1964. His fingerprints were all over this film too, as he made really good contributions to the story and characters (he was the one who made the animated waiters Penguins, Brilliant!) The reviews and box office numbers were all outstanding. Then it was nominated for a staggering 13 Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and won 5 Oscars, including Best Actress for Julie Andrews. Regrettably it did not win Best Picture, but it still has endured forever in the hearts and minds of children and adults who have seen it. Like the title of my review suggests, this is one of my all time favorite movies. And this is one of the films that inspired my interest in filmmaking, and one I will always look to with affection. I will be watching this many more times, and never get tired of it.

    Walt Disney was one of the most iconic figures of the twentieth century. He left a legacy behind filled with classic, unforgettable films like "Show White," "Sleeping Beauty" and "101 Dalmatians." With "Mary Poppins," however, he reached his zenith and produced perhaps the greatest musical ever made, a beautiful film for both adults and children. While the movie doesn't exactly do justice to the wonderful P.L. Travers' books, its originality and charm is as magical as Mary Poppins herself. Julie Andrews is perfect for the title role; pretty but cold and firm. Dick Van Dyke really shines here as Bert the chimney sweep; it's perhaps the only time he was allowed to display the full extent of his prodigious talents. Andrews and Van Dyke clearly have a great chemistry together. Disney filled "Mary Poppins" with top notch character actors, like Reta Shaw, Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher and Ed Wynn. Reginald Owen is a treat as Admiral Boom, along with Jane Darwell as the old lady behind one of the many unforgettable songs in the film, "Feed The Birds." Glynis Johns is cute as a very innocent suffragette, and David Tomlinson plays the role of distracted father/crusty banker to the hilt. But it's the songs that really make "Mary Poppins" so special. Every Baby Boomer knows them by heart; my personal favorite is the soaring (no pun intended), "Let's Go Fly A Kite." The film deserved all the accolades and praise it earned, and it remains one of the finest films in motion picture history.

    I have to admit that it's rather miraculous that I am able to remember a few of the first movies that I've ever seen as a child. I am able to recall seeing Disney films like Cinderella (1950) and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) for the first time at a very early age. So it's no surprise that I'm still able to recall seeing Mary Poppins (1964) for the first time at a young age and remembering how special an experience it was. What makes it all the more memorable is that I still enjoy Mary Poppins looking back at it as an adult just as much as I did when I saw it as a kid. In my opinion, that's the key ingredient regarding what makes a children's film timeless in the first place. We follow an unhappy British family led by Mr. and Mrs. Banks (David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns respectively) during the 1910s that are looking to hire a new nanny after their most recent one (Elsa Lanchester) quit. What they get is a magical nanny by the name of Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews in her amazing, Oscar-winning theatrical debut) who changes the entire family's lives forever. The kids (Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber) are taken on adventures beyond their wildest dreams such as jumping into chalk drawings, cleaning their room with the snap of their fingers, and other similar outings which are more magical than they sound. Joining with them on their adventures is an upbeat jack-of- all-trades by the name of Bert (Dick Van Dyke in a highly joyful role). This film basically covers Mary's time with the family until the "wind changes direction", both literally and metaphorically. What is fascinating about the story for this family film is that it teaches lessons not only to children, but also to adults. In its own unique way, it basically tells every family to meet in the middle between what the children expect from their parents and what the parents expect from their children. That means that parents should be more understanding of their children's playfulness and children should only have so much of a good thing. That's exactly the type of family dynamic that Mary Poppins tries to teach the entire Banks family through her own mysterious yet somehow wise actions. It is a profound and meaningful dynamic for any family to learn and strive for, and it's one crucial reason why Mary Poppins is still an original and unique family picture almost 50 years since it first came out. But of course, it isn't the only reason why I still love Mary Poppins now. Looking back at it again, I just picked up on how funny, witty and charming this movie really is. At times, the humor bares comparison with some of the greatest comedies of the 20th century like Duck Soup (1933) and Modern Times (1936). Other times, I was displaying an affectionate smile either for the terrific lines of dialogue made possible by writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi or recalling just how cool and charming every scene is. Remember the scene with Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) floating up in the air because he's laughing so hard? Remember the chimney sweeps (including Bert) doing some dangerous dancing on the rooftops? This film contains just one great scene after another and at a running time of more than 2 hours, it all moves exceedingly well. If that isn't a compliment to Walt Disney's master storytelling, I don't know what is. I briefly mentioned earlier that this was Julie Andrews' acting debut as the main character Mary Poppins and considering that she won an Oscar for her first performance, it's an impressive way to start out her career. Between her superb singing skills, her comfort in the role, and her overall excellent delivery, I can definitely see why she earned the Oscar. I know Dick Van Dyke has received criticism for his British accent, but to be brutally honest, I never saw the problem because I don't know anything about true Cockney accents. I honestly loved Dick Van Dyke in this movie regardless. I thought he had charm and wit to spare, he worked very well with the kids, he always had a positive attitude, he was highly entertaining overall. Even David Tomlinson is outstanding as Mr. Banks. For me, this is the strict parental figure done right. He may be able to tolerate the playfulness of his children for a very limited time, but the filmmakers still made a likable character out of him and somehow make his stubbornness funny. I think we all know how great the music and songs written by Richard and Robert Sherman are here. We all remember the song "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and the meaning of that unorthodox word. It's practically a word that's used when there's nothing else to say, and there's nothing else I can say about that word except..the word. How do you like that? There's a reason why this film is one of the only 2 Disney movies to be on the list of the AFI's 25 Greatest Musicals. The fact that it's filled with timeless songs such as "A Spoonful of Sugar", "I Love to Laugh" and the Oscar-winning "Chim Chim Cheree" should explain enough. They're cheerful, they're memorable, they're catchy, the songs and music are basically everything you could ask for from a musical. Mary Poppins easily takes its place amongst the finest films that Disney has ever put out. The story flows very well at 139 minutes and the fact that it moves more efficiently than most films of that running time is further proof of Mr. Disney's master skills as a storyteller. The music, the acting, the characters, the writing and even some of the special effects all come together in a wonderful family film that is "practically perfect in every way".

    Just for a moment, think of all those movies about monsters and manifestations of evil. There is the creature in Alien, the machine in Terminator, Predator and the various zombie movies, blood sucking vampire movies, movies with representations of the devil in various forms, including Al Pacino, and all the other incarnate creatures of hell. Have you ever wondered why all the creatures of supposed evil are so ghastly, armed with sharp teeth, claws and mouths that emit flames? Why do they require this weaponry? You understand why when you look at their opponents; they have to take on the likes of Mary Poppins. Mary Poppins is essentially a white witch. And she is awesomely powerful. Every time I watch a clip of "A Spoon Full Of Sugar" it sends shivers up my spine and makes me realise just how seriously omnipotent this lady is. If Mary Poppins was offended by the behaviour of Alien, Predator, Al Pacino's devil and the fury of the Incredible Hulk all at the same time, she would have them wearing nappies and a bib with a click of her fingers. Mary Poppins is God's white Protestant representative on planet Earth and is armed with all the tools to dispatch harmony on our poor souls. Unfortunately it is only a movie. Mary Poppins is a character every child needs to be able to call upon. Rather her than Santa Claus.

    I'd like to think that I've seen a lot of movies, of varying quality and genre; enough to believe I have at least a basic grasp of cinema as a whole. But during all the classics and tripe I've endured over the years, Mary Poppins has somehow managed to evade me. I was too busy watching rabbits getting torn to pieces in Watership Down (1978) and clapping giddily at Rocky Balboa's training montage in Rocky (1976) as a child to be distracted by something quite as colourful as this. So, it's at the ripe old age of 28 that I came round to sitting through Mary Poppins, to struggle through its squeaky-clean visage and many, many songs that I somehow knew all the words to before seeing the film. Well, I was wrong to be so cynical, as although the film is hardly what I would call a classic, it's really rather good. London, 1910. Merry jack-of-all-trades Bert (Dick Van Dyke) is playing a one-man-band to an enthusiastic street audience when he senses something magical in the air, signalling the return of his good friend Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews). He takes us into the stable yet unhappy Banks' family home, where the household is ran by lord-of-his-castle Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson), and his suffragette wife Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns). Busy attending to work and other matters, the Banks' have started to neglect their children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber). After their umpteenth nanny walks out on them, Mr. Banks makes a desperate newspaper plea for a nanny who will lay down the law, and teach the children respect and the harshness of life. So enters Mary Poppins, 'perfect in every way', a nanny who is as strict as she needs to be but one capable of also showing the children the joys of life. Mary Poppins suffers mainly from the same thing that I feel plagues most musicals - it's too long. Seemingly every musical feels the need to round-up every change of emotion and sub-plot with a grand song-and- dance number that gets old quickly. The first half of the film is pure family entertainment, with memorable songs and some stunning special effects (for its day) making the film zip by happily. Then the songs get more clunky and forgettable, and we are exposed to much more of Dick Van Dyke's terrible accent and his grating, over-enthusiastic Bert than we need (although I'm sure he has his many fans). Yet after the somewhat exhausting 139 minutes is over, Poppins still leaves you with that cuddly feeling inside, something I thought had died inside me when I sprouted my first pube. Most of the success of Poppins comes from the performance of Julie Andrews. All sweet and idyllic, she could have come across as a stuck-up Miss Perfect, but Andrews' effortless likability and stage experience makes her more of a supernatural missionary, sent to make a stand against Mr. Banks' stern and rigid outlook on life. Disney were really coming out of their Golden Era at the time of this being released, but it's still one of their most fondly remembered, and certainly their most critically successful live-action efforts. It's more than likely that children will turn away from it, due to the mega-bucks spewed into children's films these days, but it will continue to enchant adults, especially those that grew up with it, and even those new to it, like me. Chim-chimernee, chim-ernee, chim chim, cheroo! Damn it, it's in my head again!

    Even as a 9-year-old in 1965, I knew that this movie was awful. Julie Andrews was all wrong for the part of Mary Poppins, and the animation was flawed and cheesy. The book's author, P.L. Travers, soon regretted collaborating with Disney on this project. She begged him to leave out the animation, and cast someone more appropriate in the title role. Disney, the bastard, turned on his heel and said "Pamela, that ship has sailed." He refused to make any of the changes back to her original book. The result was a horrible adaptation that Travers was bitter about until the day she died. Disney was a nasty piece of work. "Alice in Wonderland" was another story he ruined. Rot in hell, Mr. Disney!

    I first saw this film over 20 years ago back in the days when they had the video player, this is a film I liked better when I got older. This film is about Mary Poppins being a Nanny to two children Jane and Michael (played by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) after the nanny leaves because the kids had ran away. There are good songs in this, my favourite songs has to be 'I Love To Laugh' and 'Feed The Bird. My favourite scenes are Mary Poppins singing Feed The Birds and A Spoonful Of Sugar. When I was younger I found the scene when the old man from the bank (played by Dick Van Dyke) dying laughing disturbing but it doesn't bother me much now I am older.

    and it is enough. because its charm is fresh. its songs - adorable. its science to transform a book in a fairy - tale, with each regular ingredient at perfect place, with cartoons, good actors and slices of extraordinary adventures is a great virtue. a classic. but in a form very special. because its message is more important today. the nice special effects, the shining Julie Andrews, the performance of children and, in same time, the music. a magic film about magic and seed for a wave, not exactly small of films about powerful/seductive nannies. so, must see it again ! because it is not only a beautiful film or a wise story. it is a gift. and heart for state of spirit.

Glynis Johns is cute as a very innocent suffragette, and David Tomlinson plays the role of distracted father/crusty banker to the hilt. But it's the songs that really make "Mary Poppins" so special. Every Baby Boomer knows them by heart; my personal favorite is the soaring (no pun intended), "Let's Go Fly A Kite." The film deserved all the accolades and praise it earned, and it remains one of the finest films in motion picture history.

    I have to admit that it's rather miraculous that I am able to remember a few of the first movies that I've ever seen as a child. I am able to recall seeing Disney films like Cinderella (1950) and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) for the first time at a very early age. So it's no surprise that I'm still able to recall seeing Mary Poppins (1964) for the first time at a young age and remembering how special an experience it was. What makes it all the more memorable is that I still enjoy Mary Poppins looking back at it as an adult just as much as I did when I saw it as a kid. In my opinion, that's the key ingredient regarding what makes a children's film timeless in the first place. We follow an unhappy British family led by Mr. and Mrs. Banks (David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns respectively) during the 1910s that are looking to hire a new nanny after their most recent one (Elsa Lanchester) quit. What they get is a magical nanny by the name of Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews in her amazing, Oscar-winning theatrical debut) who changes the entire family's lives forever. The kids (Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber) are taken on adventures beyond their wildest dreams such as jumping into chalk drawings, cleaning their room with the snap of their fingers, and other similar outings which are more magical than they sound. Joining with them on their adventures is an upbeat jack-of- all-trades by the name of Bert (Dick Van Dyke in a highly joyful role). This film basically covers Mary's time with the family until the "wind changes direction", both literally and metaphorically. What is fascinating about the story for this family film is that it teaches lessons not only to children, but also to adults. In its own unique way, it basically tells every family to meet in the middle between what the children expect from their parents and what the parents expect from their children. That means that parents should be more understanding of their children's playfulness and children should only have so much of a good thing. That's exactly the type of family dynamic that Mary Poppins tries to teach the entire Banks family through her own mysterious yet somehow wise actions. It is a profound and meaningful dynamic for any family to learn and strive for, and it's one crucial reason why Mary Poppins is still an original and unique family picture almost 50 years since it first came out. But of course, it isn't the only reason why I still love Mary Poppins now. Looking back at it again, I just picked up on how funny, witty and charming this movie really is. At times, the humor bares comparison with some of the greatest comedies of the 20th century like Duck Soup (1933) and Modern Times (1936). Other times, I was displaying an affectionate smile either for the terrific lines of dialogue made possible by writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi or recalling just how cool and charming every scene is. Remember the scene with Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) floating up in the air because he's laughing so hard? Remember the chimney sweeps (including Bert) doing some dangerous dancing on the rooftops? This film contains just one great scene after another and at a running time of more than 2 hours, it all moves exceedingly well. If that isn't a compliment to Walt Disney's master storytelling, I don't know what is. I briefly mentioned earlier that this was Julie Andrews' acting debut as the main character Mary Poppins and considering that she won an Oscar for her first performance, it's an impressive way to start out her career. Between her superb singing skills, her comfort in the role, and her overall excellent delivery, I can definitely see why she earned the Oscar. I know Dick Van Dyke has received criticism for his British accent, but to be brutally honest, I never saw the problem because I don't know anything about true Cockney accents. I honestly loved Dick Van Dyke in this movie regardless. I thought he had charm and wit to spare, he worked very well with the kids, he always had a positive attitude, he was highly entertaining overall. Even David Tomlinson is outstanding as Mr. Banks. For me, this is the strict parental figure done right. He may be able to tolerate the playfulness of his children for a very limited time, but the filmmakers still made a likable character out of him and somehow make his stubbornness funny. I think we all know how great the music and songs written by Richard and Robert Sherman are here. We all remember the song "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and the meaning of that unorthodox word. It's practically a word that's used when there's nothing else to say, and there's nothing else I can say about that word except..the word. How do you like that? There's a reason why this film is one of the only 2 Disney movies to be on the list of the AFI's 25 Greatest Musicals. The fact that it's filled with timeless songs such as "A Spoonful of Sugar", "I Love to Laugh" and the Oscar-winning "Chim Chim Cheree" should explain enough. They're cheerful, they're memorable, they're catchy, the songs and music are basically everything you could ask for from a musical. Mary Poppins easily takes its place amongst the finest films that Disney has ever put out. The story flows very well at 139 minutes and the fact that it moves more efficiently than most films of that running time is further proof of Mr. Disney's master skills as a storyteller. The music, the acting, the characters, the writing and even some of the special effects all come together in a wonderful family film that is "practically perfect in every way".

    Just for a moment, think of all those movies about monsters and manifestations of evil. There is the creature in Alien, the machine in Terminator, Predator and the various zombie movies, blood sucking vampire movies, movies with representations of the devil in various forms, including Al Pacino, and all the other incarnate creatures of hell. Have you ever wondered why all the creatures of supposed evil are so ghastly, armed with sharp teeth, claws and mouths that emit flames? Why do they require this weaponry? You understand why when you look at their opponents; they have to take on the likes of Mary Poppins. Mary Poppins is essentially a white witch. And she is awesomely powerful. Every time I watch a clip of "A Spoon Full Of Sugar" it sends shivers up my spine and makes me realise just how seriously omnipotent this lady is. If Mary Poppins was offended by the behaviour of Alien, Predator, Al Pacino's devil and the fury of the Incredible Hulk all at the same time, she would have them wearing nappies and a bib with a click of her fingers. Mary Poppins is God's white Protestant representative on planet Earth and is armed with all the tools to dispatch harmony on our poor souls. Unfortunately it is only a movie. Mary Poppins is a character every child needs to be able to call upon. Rather her than Santa Claus.

    I'd like to think that I've seen a lot of movies, of varying quality and genre; enough to believe I have at least a basic grasp of cinema as a whole. But during all the classics and tripe I've endured over the years, Mary Poppins has somehow managed to evade me. I was too busy watching rabbits getting torn to pieces in Watership Down (1978) and clapping giddily at Rocky Balboa's training montage in Rocky (1976) as a child to be distracted by something quite as colourful as this. So, it's at the ripe old age of 28 that I came round to sitting through Mary Poppins, to struggle through its squeaky-clean visage and many, many songs that I somehow knew all the words to before seeing the film. Well, I was wrong to be so cynical, as although the film is hardly what I would call a classic, it's really rather good. London, 1910. Merry jack-of-all-trades Bert (Dick Van Dyke) is playing a one-man-band to an enthusiastic street audience when he senses something magical in the air, signalling the return of his good friend Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews). He takes us into the stable yet unhappy Banks' family home, where the household is ran by lord-of-his-castle Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson), and his suffragette wife Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns). Busy attending to work and other matters, the Banks' have started to neglect their children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber). After their umpteenth nanny walks out on them, Mr. Banks makes a desperate newspaper plea for a nanny who will lay down the law, and teach the children respect and the harshness of life. So enters Mary Poppins, 'perfect in every way', a nanny who is as strict as she needs to be but one capable of also showing the children the joys of life. Mary Poppins suffers mainly from the same thing that I feel plagues most musicals - it's too long. Seemingly every musical feels the need to round-up every change of emotion and sub-plot with a grand song-and- dance number that gets old quickly. The first half of the film is pure family entertainment, with memorable songs and some stunning special effects (for its day) making the film zip by happily. Then the songs get more clunky and forgettable, and we are exposed to much more of Dick Van Dyke's terrible accent and his grating, over-enthusiastic Bert than we need (although I'm sure he has his many fans). Yet after the somewhat exhausting 139 minutes is over, Poppins still leaves you with that cuddly feeling inside, something I thought had died inside me when I sprouted my first pube. Most of the success of Poppins comes from the performance of Julie Andrews. All sweet and idyllic, she could have come across as a stuck-up Miss Perfect, but Andrews' effortless likability and stage experience makes her more of a supernatural missionary, sent to make a stand against Mr. Banks' stern and rigid outlook on life. Disney were really coming out of their Golden Era at the time of this being released, but it's still one of their most fondly remembered, and certainly their most critically successful live-action efforts. It's more than likely that children will turn away from it, due to the mega-bucks spewed into children's films these days, but it will continue to enchant adults, especially those that grew up with it, and even those new to it, like me. Chim-chimernee, chim-ernee, chim chim, cheroo! Damn it, it's in my head again!

    Even as a 9-year-old in 1965, I knew that this movie was awful. Julie Andrews was all wrong for the part of Mary Poppins, and the animation was flawed and cheesy. The book's author, P.L. Travers, soon regretted collaborating with Disney on this project. She begged him to leave out the animation, and cast someone more appropriate in the title role. Disney, the bastard, turned on his heel and said "Pamela, that ship has sailed." He refused to make any of the changes back to her original book. The result was a horrible adaptation that Travers was bitter about until the day she died. Disney was a nasty piece of work. "Alice in Wonderland" was another story he ruined. Rot in hell, Mr. Disney!

    I first saw this film over 20 years ago back in the days when they had the video player, this is a film I liked better when I got older. This film is about Mary Poppins being a Nanny to two children Jane and Michael (played by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) after the nanny leaves because the kids had ran away. There are good songs in this, my favourite songs has to be 'I Love To Laugh' and 'Feed The Bird. My favourite scenes are Mary Poppins singing Feed The Birds and A Spoonful Of Sugar. When I was younger I found the scene when the old man from the bank (played by Dick Van Dyke) dying laughing disturbing but it doesn't bother me much now I am older.

    and it is enough. because its charm is fresh. its songs - adorable. its science to transform a book in a fairy - tale, with each regular ingredient at perfect place, with cartoons, good actors and slices of extraordinary adventures is a great virtue. a classic. but in a form very special. because its message is more important today. the nice special effects, the shining Julie Andrews, the performance of children and, in same time, the music. a magic film about magic and seed for a wave, not exactly small of films about powerful/seductive nannies. so, must see it again ! because it is not only a beautiful film or a wise story. it is a gift. and heart for state of spirit.

    I Watched this movie on GO and online but mostly on DVD. I did not get the point of the movie because it was all mixed and not that entertaining, however the music was perfect and a spoonful of sugar ha ha. One of the most cool thing in this movie was how you get to feel the wonders and thoughts in the characters minds and hearts which was truly mad and fun. Another Its a very long movie with lots of colours and funny graphics, however it did not have any movie texture or any scenes which didn't have utter nonsense. I would recommend this movie to people whom love and admire magical tales and flying in the air blah blah.

    I always wanted to see Mary Poppins as the idea of a magical nanny really appealed to me and I have to admit that the animation is pretty amazing for its time but the story is usually what interests me most and the problem I had is that I watched this movie after I'd seen Nanny McPhee. I thought it would be an original story with great songs. I already loved the 'Spoon full of sugar'-song and the Supercallifragi-song as I had lots of Disney CD's before I watched the movie. So I convinced two people to watch it together with me as it's a classic. And we were about halfway when everybody looked at each other and said: "Do you still like this?" And we all had to admit we were really annoyed, not only bored but actually annoyed with the story. Sure there is lots of potential in a story about a magical nanny! And still, there is no real story, no story that keeps you tied to the screen anyway. We sat through the whole movie (again, because it's a classic) but we all didn't really enjoy it. I was actually bothered by a few questions afterwards: Why is that stupid Dick Van Dyke-character in this movie? Why put all these chimney sweepers and distract us from the really interesting character (or you would expect so anyway): Mary Poppins. It's the title of the movie! Why not focus on all the magical things she can do and will do to help educate and bring up the children? There must be more than magical room-cleaning... What annoyed me most was the 'Jolly holly day with Mary'-song which went on and on and on. Every time I thought the stupid song was over, it started again and it just put the story on hold. Sadly enough, this movie was made back in those days when musical songs did not yet carry the story and unraveled extra plot elements but when songs were a detour. And what are penguins doing in this movie anyway? It's like they wanted to show off with what they were able to do at the expense of the story. So I hate to say this as I'm a big Disney fan! (But that doesn't mean I'll blindly love every single one of the movies) I really didn't like Mary Poppins. Give it a shot. Maybe you will... but I sure didn't. One day, I'd like to give it another shot but not for at least ten years. I'd probably like Nanny McPhee turned into animation but Mary Poppins is just not for me...

    Mary Poppins is one of those films that works on every level its been given. This was the film that Walt Disney dedicated most of his life and career to get made. He and his exceptional team of geniuses lifted the characters and some story from P.L. Traver's "good" book and transformed it into something that will stand the test of time. The story is about the dysfunctional Banks family in Edwardian London. The children Jane and Michael are rambunctious and keep annoying nannies out of the house. The parents, George and Winifred, are good people but are way too focused on their profession and causes to notice that the kids just want their love. Then comes Mary Poppins on her flying umbrella. She is a sweet but still stern lady who takes the kids on these whimsical adventures and sings catchy songs. But she's there for more than that (something way deeper), she is there to help mend the broken family. What makes great characters is a great cast, and that movie has it all. Julie Andrews (in her film debut) gives one of the best heroines ever put to screen. She is "prctically perfect in every way." Dick Van Dyke gives a very funny and at times touching performance as her jack-of-all-trades cockney companion Bert. David Tomlinson gives possibly one of my favorite performances in any movie as Mr. Banks. You see his journey over the course of the film and the moment is beautiful when he realizes that his kids and his wife are more important than what his bosses (played memorably by Arthur Malet and Dick van Dyke in heavy makeup) at the bank tell him and what he thought was important. And Glynis Johns gives a funny performance as the chipper suffragette Mrs. Banks. The story and score are something to behold. This is one of the best thought out of any Disney movie before or since (except Beauty and the Beast) Writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi concocted a story full of whimsy, sweetness, and surprisingly, very good drama. And then the Sherman Brother's score adds to the timeless quality of the film. There are showstoppers ("Supercalifragilistiexpialidocious" and "A Spoonful of Sugar") but the ones I like are either subtle or just fun to watch and listen to, "Step in Time, "A Man has Dreams," and the best song of the movie "Feed the Birds" (which features a great cameo by the great Jane Darwell) The song gives away Mary Poppins' message, which is that the small things in life are important, and family love is the ultimate gift for any person young or old. The man who also held this all together and mixed them in a beautiful way was long time Disney director Robert Stevenson, knowing just when to blend lightness and whimsy with pathos and drama. Then there are the special effects. This is one of the first movies I saw where I was blown away (even as a little kid) because i thought it was all real. It's one of those films that uses special effects to tell the story, not to distract the viewer. Nowhere is this more evident than artist Peter Ellenshaw's masterpiece matte paintings. They are warm, nostalgia, and thoroughly convincing. The animated sequence is fun too, with the waiter penguins being the best part of that whole adventure This is Walt Disney's best film, and was hailed as such when it premiered in August 1964. His fingerprints were all over this film too, as he made really good contributions to the story and characters (he was the one who made the animated waiters Penguins, Brilliant!) The reviews and box office numbers were all outstanding. Then it was nominated for a staggering 13 Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and won 5 Oscars, including Best Actress for Julie Andrews. Regrettably it did not win Best Picture, but it still has endured forever in the hearts and minds of children and adults who have seen it. Like the title of my review suggests, this is one of my all time favorite movies. And this is one of the films that inspired my interest in filmmaking, and one I will always look to with affection. I will be watching this many more times, and never get tired of it.

    Walt Disney was one of the most iconic figures of the twentieth century. He left a legacy behind filled with classic, unforgettable films like "Show White," "Sleeping Beauty" and "101 Dalmatians." With "Mary Poppins," however, he reached his zenith and produced perhaps the greatest musical ever made, a beautiful film for both adults and children. While the movie doesn't exactly do justice to the wonderful P.L. Travers' books, its originality and charm is as magical as Mary Poppins herself. Julie Andrews is perfect for the title role; pretty but cold and firm. Dick Van Dyke really shines here as Bert the chimney sweep; it's perhaps the only time he was allowed to display the full extent of his prodigious talents. Andrews and Van Dyke clearly have a great chemistry together. Disney filled "Mary Poppins" with top notch character actors, like Reta Shaw, Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher and Ed Wynn. Reginald Owen is a treat as Admiral Boom, along with Jane Darwell as the old lady behind one of the many unforgettable songs in the film, "Feed The Birds."

So, it's at the ripe old age of 28 that I came round to sitting through Mary Poppins, to struggle through its squeaky-clean visage and many, many songs that I somehow knew all the words to before seeing the film. Well, I was wrong to be so cynical, as although the film is hardly what I would call a classic, it's really rather good. London, 1910. Merry jack-of-all-trades Bert (Dick Van Dyke) is playing a one-man-band to an enthusiastic street audience when he senses something magical in the air, signalling the return of his good friend Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews). He takes us into the stable yet unhappy Banks' family home, where the household is ran by lord-of-his-castle Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson), and his suffragette wife Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns). Busy attending to work and other matters, the Banks' have started to neglect their children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber). After their umpteenth nanny walks out on them, Mr. Banks makes a desperate newspaper plea for a nanny who will lay down the law, and teach the children respect and the harshness of life. So enters Mary Poppins, 'perfect in every way', a nanny who is as strict as she needs to be but one capable of also showing the children the joys of life. Mary Poppins suffers mainly from the same thing that I feel plagues most musicals - it's too long. Seemingly every musical feels the need to round-up every change of emotion and sub-plot with a grand song-and- dance number that gets old quickly. The first half of the film is pure family entertainment, with memorable songs and some stunning special effects (for its day) making the film zip by happily. Then the songs get more clunky and forgettable, and we are exposed to much more of Dick Van Dyke's terrible accent and his grating, over-enthusiastic Bert than we need (although I'm sure he has his many fans). Yet after the somewhat exhausting 139 minutes is over, Poppins still leaves you with that cuddly feeling inside, something I thought had died inside me when I sprouted my first pube. Most of the success of Poppins comes from the performance of Julie Andrews. All sweet and idyllic, she could have come across as a stuck-up Miss Perfect, but Andrews' effortless likability and stage experience makes her more of a supernatural missionary, sent to make a stand against Mr. Banks' stern and rigid outlook on life. Disney were really coming out of their Golden Era at the time of this being released, but it's still one of their most fondly remembered, and certainly their most critically successful live-action efforts. It's more than likely that children will turn away from it, due to the mega-bucks spewed into children's films these days, but it will continue to enchant adults, especially those that grew up with it, and even those new to it, like me. Chim-chimernee, chim-ernee, chim chim, cheroo! Damn it, it's in my head again!

    Even as a 9-year-old in 1965, I knew that this movie was awful. Julie Andrews was all wrong for the part of Mary Poppins, and the animation was flawed and cheesy. The book's author, P.L. Travers, soon regretted collaborating with Disney on this project. She begged him to leave out the animation, and cast someone more appropriate in the title role. Disney, the bastard, turned on his heel and said "Pamela, that ship has sailed." He refused to make any of the changes back to her original book. The result was a horrible adaptation that Travers was bitter about until the day she died. Disney was a nasty piece of work. "Alice in Wonderland" was another story he ruined. Rot in hell, Mr. Disney!

    I first saw this film over 20 years ago back in the days when they had the video player, this is a film I liked better when I got older. This film is about Mary Poppins being a Nanny to two children Jane and Michael (played by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) after the nanny leaves because the kids had ran away. There are good songs in this, my favourite songs has to be 'I Love To Laugh' and 'Feed The Bird. My favourite scenes are Mary Poppins singing Feed The Birds and A Spoonful Of Sugar. When I was younger I found the scene when the old man from the bank (played by Dick Van Dyke) dying laughing disturbing but it doesn't bother me much now I am older.

    and it is enough. because its charm is fresh. its songs - adorable. its science to transform a book in a fairy - tale, with each regular ingredient at perfect place, with cartoons, good actors and slices of extraordinary adventures is a great virtue. a classic. but in a form very special. because its message is more important today. the nice special effects, the shining Julie Andrews, the performance of children and, in same time, the music. a magic film about magic and seed for a wave, not exactly small of films about powerful/seductive nannies. so, must see it again ! because it is not only a beautiful film or a wise story. it is a gift. and heart for state of spirit.

    I Watched this movie on GO and online but mostly on DVD. I did not get the point of the movie because it was all mixed and not that entertaining, however the music was perfect and a spoonful of sugar ha ha. One of the most cool thing in this movie was how you get to feel the wonders and thoughts in the characters minds and hearts which was truly mad and fun. Another Its a very long movie with lots of colours and funny graphics, however it did not have any movie texture or any scenes which didn't have utter nonsense. I would recommend this movie to people whom love and admire magical tales and flying in the air blah blah.

    I always wanted to see Mary Poppins as the idea of a magical nanny really appealed to me and I have to admit that the animation is pretty amazing for its time but the story is usually what interests me most and the problem I had is that I watched this movie after I'd seen Nanny McPhee. I thought it would be an original story with great songs. I already loved the 'Spoon full of sugar'-song and the Supercallifragi-song as I had lots of Disney CD's before I watched the movie. So I convinced two people to watch it together with me as it's a classic. And we were about halfway when everybody looked at each other and said: "Do you still like this?" And we all had to admit we were really annoyed, not only bored but actually annoyed with the story. Sure there is lots of potential in a story about a magical nanny! And still, there is no real story, no story that keeps you tied to the screen anyway. We sat through the whole movie (again, because it's a classic) but we all didn't really enjoy it. I was actually bothered by a few questions afterwards: Why is that stupid Dick Van Dyke-character in this movie? Why put all these chimney sweepers and distract us from the really interesting character (or you would expect so anyway): Mary Poppins. It's the title of the movie! Why not focus on all the magical things she can do and will do to help educate and bring up the children? There must be more than magical room-cleaning... What annoyed me most was the 'Jolly holly day with Mary'-song which went on and on and on. Every time I thought the stupid song was over, it started again and it just put the story on hold. Sadly enough, this movie was made back in those days when musical songs did not yet carry the story and unraveled extra plot elements but when songs were a detour. And what are penguins doing in this movie anyway? It's like they wanted to show off with what they were able to do at the expense of the story. So I hate to say this as I'm a big Disney fan! (But that doesn't mean I'll blindly love every single one of the movies) I really didn't like Mary Poppins. Give it a shot. Maybe you will... but I sure didn't. One day, I'd like to give it another shot but not for at least ten years. I'd probably like Nanny McPhee turned into animation but Mary Poppins is just not for me...

    Mary Poppins is one of those films that works on every level its been given. This was the film that Walt Disney dedicated most of his life and career to get made. He and his exceptional team of geniuses lifted the characters and some story from P.L. Traver's "good" book and transformed it into something that will stand the test of time. The story is about the dysfunctional Banks family in Edwardian London. The children Jane and Michael are rambunctious and keep annoying nannies out of the house. The parents, George and Winifred, are good people but are way too focused on their profession and causes to notice that the kids just want their love. Then comes Mary Poppins on her flying umbrella. She is a sweet but still stern lady who takes the kids on these whimsical adventures and sings catchy songs. But she's there for more than that (something way deeper), she is there to help mend the broken family. What makes great characters is a great cast, and that movie has it all. Julie Andrews (in her film debut) gives one of the best heroines ever put to screen. She is "prctically perfect in every way." Dick Van Dyke gives a very funny and at times touching performance as her jack-of-all-trades cockney companion Bert. David Tomlinson gives possibly one of my favorite performances in any movie as Mr. Banks. You see his journey over the course of the film and the moment is beautiful when he realizes that his kids and his wife are more important than what his bosses (played memorably by Arthur Malet and Dick van Dyke in heavy makeup) at the bank tell him and what he thought was important. And Glynis Johns gives a funny performance as the chipper suffragette Mrs. Banks. The story and score are something to behold. This is one of the best thought out of any Disney movie before or since (except Beauty and the Beast) Writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi concocted a story full of whimsy, sweetness, and surprisingly, very good drama. And then the Sherman Brother's score adds to the timeless quality of the film. There are showstoppers ("Supercalifragilistiexpialidocious" and "A Spoonful of Sugar") but the ones I like are either subtle or just fun to watch and listen to, "Step in Time, "A Man has Dreams," and the best song of the movie "Feed the Birds" (which features a great cameo by the great Jane Darwell) The song gives away Mary Poppins' message, which is that the small things in life are important, and family love is the ultimate gift for any person young or old. The man who also held this all together and mixed them in a beautiful way was long time Disney director Robert Stevenson, knowing just when to blend lightness and whimsy with pathos and drama. Then there are the special effects. This is one of the first movies I saw where I was blown away (even as a little kid) because i thought it was all real. It's one of those films that uses special effects to tell the story, not to distract the viewer. Nowhere is this more evident than artist Peter Ellenshaw's masterpiece matte paintings. They are warm, nostalgia, and thoroughly convincing. The animated sequence is fun too, with the waiter penguins being the best part of that whole adventure This is Walt Disney's best film, and was hailed as such when it premiered in August 1964. His fingerprints were all over this film too, as he made really good contributions to the story and characters (he was the one who made the animated waiters Penguins, Brilliant!) The reviews and box office numbers were all outstanding. Then it was nominated for a staggering 13 Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and won 5 Oscars, including Best Actress for Julie Andrews. Regrettably it did not win Best Picture, but it still has endured forever in the hearts and minds of children and adults who have seen it. Like the title of my review suggests, this is one of my all time favorite movies. And this is one of the films that inspired my interest in filmmaking, and one I will always look to with affection. I will be watching this many more times, and never get tired of it.

    Walt Disney was one of the most iconic figures of the twentieth century. He left a legacy behind filled with classic, unforgettable films like "Show White," "Sleeping Beauty" and "101 Dalmatians." With "Mary Poppins," however, he reached his zenith and produced perhaps the greatest musical ever made, a beautiful film for both adults and children. While the movie doesn't exactly do justice to the wonderful P.L. Travers' books, its originality and charm is as magical as Mary Poppins herself. Julie Andrews is perfect for the title role; pretty but cold and firm. Dick Van Dyke really shines here as Bert the chimney sweep; it's perhaps the only time he was allowed to display the full extent of his prodigious talents. Andrews and Van Dyke clearly have a great chemistry together. Disney filled "Mary Poppins" with top notch character actors, like Reta Shaw, Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher and Ed Wynn. Reginald Owen is a treat as Admiral Boom, along with Jane Darwell as the old lady behind one of the many unforgettable songs in the film, "Feed The Birds." Glynis Johns is cute as a very innocent suffragette, and David Tomlinson plays the role of distracted father/crusty banker to the hilt. But it's the songs that really make "Mary Poppins" so special. Every Baby Boomer knows them by heart; my personal favorite is the soaring (no pun intended), "Let's Go Fly A Kite." The film deserved all the accolades and praise it earned, and it remains one of the finest films in motion picture history.

    I have to admit that it's rather miraculous that I am able to remember a few of the first movies that I've ever seen as a child. I am able to recall seeing Disney films like Cinderella (1950) and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) for the first time at a very early age. So it's no surprise that I'm still able to recall seeing Mary Poppins (1964) for the first time at a young age and remembering how special an experience it was. What makes it all the more memorable is that I still enjoy Mary Poppins looking back at it as an adult just as much as I did when I saw it as a kid. In my opinion, that's the key ingredient regarding what makes a children's film timeless in the first place. We follow an unhappy British family led by Mr. and Mrs. Banks (David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns respectively) during the 1910s that are looking to hire a new nanny after their most recent one (Elsa Lanchester) quit. What they get is a magical nanny by the name of Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews in her amazing, Oscar-winning theatrical debut) who changes the entire family's lives forever. The kids (Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber) are taken on adventures beyond their wildest dreams such as jumping into chalk drawings, cleaning their room with the snap of their fingers, and other similar outings which are more magical than they sound. Joining with them on their adventures is an upbeat jack-of- all-trades by the name of Bert (Dick Van Dyke in a highly joyful role). This film basically covers Mary's time with the family until the "wind changes direction", both literally and metaphorically. What is fascinating about the story for this family film is that it teaches lessons not only to children, but also to adults. In its own unique way, it basically tells every family to meet in the middle between what the children expect from their parents and what the parents expect from their children. That means that parents should be more understanding of their children's playfulness and children should only have so much of a good thing. That's exactly the type of family dynamic that Mary Poppins tries to teach the entire Banks family through her own mysterious yet somehow wise actions. It is a profound and meaningful dynamic for any family to learn and strive for, and it's one crucial reason why Mary Poppins is still an original and unique family picture almost 50 years since it first came out. But of course, it isn't the only reason why I still love Mary Poppins now. Looking back at it again, I just picked up on how funny, witty and charming this movie really is. At times, the humor bares comparison with some of the greatest comedies of the 20th century like Duck Soup (1933) and Modern Times (1936). Other times, I was displaying an affectionate smile either for the terrific lines of dialogue made possible by writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi or recalling just how cool and charming every scene is. Remember the scene with Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) floating up in the air because he's laughing so hard? Remember the chimney sweeps (including Bert) doing some dangerous dancing on the rooftops? This film contains just one great scene after another and at a running time of more than 2 hours, it all moves exceedingly well. If that isn't a compliment to Walt Disney's master storytelling, I don't know what is. I briefly mentioned earlier that this was Julie Andrews' acting debut as the main character Mary Poppins and considering that she won an Oscar for her first performance, it's an impressive way to start out her career. Between her superb singing skills, her comfort in the role, and her overall excellent delivery, I can definitely see why she earned the Oscar. I know Dick Van Dyke has received criticism for his British accent, but to be brutally honest, I never saw the problem because I don't know anything about true Cockney accents. I honestly loved Dick Van Dyke in this movie regardless. I thought he had charm and wit to spare, he worked very well with the kids, he always had a positive attitude, he was highly entertaining overall. Even David Tomlinson is outstanding as Mr. Banks. For me, this is the strict parental figure done right. He may be able to tolerate the playfulness of his children for a very limited time, but the filmmakers still made a likable character out of him and somehow make his stubbornness funny. I think we all know how great the music and songs written by Richard and Robert Sherman are here. We all remember the song "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and the meaning of that unorthodox word. It's practically a word that's used when there's nothing else to say, and there's nothing else I can say about that word except..the word. How do you like that? There's a reason why this film is one of the only 2 Disney movies to be on the list of the AFI's 25 Greatest Musicals. The fact that it's filled with timeless songs such as "A Spoonful of Sugar", "I Love to Laugh" and the Oscar-winning "Chim Chim Cheree" should explain enough. They're cheerful, they're memorable, they're catchy, the songs and music are basically everything you could ask for from a musical. Mary Poppins easily takes its place amongst the finest films that Disney has ever put out. The story flows very well at 139 minutes and the fact that it moves more efficiently than most films of that running time is further proof of Mr. Disney's master skills as a storyteller. The music, the acting, the characters, the writing and even some of the special effects all come together in a wonderful family film that is "practically perfect in every way".

    Just for a moment, think of all those movies about monsters and manifestations of evil. There is the creature in Alien, the machine in Terminator, Predator and the various zombie movies, blood sucking vampire movies, movies with representations of the devil in various forms, including Al Pacino, and all the other incarnate creatures of hell. Have you ever wondered why all the creatures of supposed evil are so ghastly, armed with sharp teeth, claws and mouths that emit flames? Why do they require this weaponry? You understand why when you look at their opponents; they have to take on the likes of Mary Poppins. Mary Poppins is essentially a white witch. And she is awesomely powerful. Every time I watch a clip of "A Spoon Full Of Sugar" it sends shivers up my spine and makes me realise just how seriously omnipotent this lady is. If Mary Poppins was offended by the behaviour of Alien, Predator, Al Pacino's devil and the fury of the Incredible Hulk all at the same time, she would have them wearing nappies and a bib with a click of her fingers. Mary Poppins is God's white Protestant representative on planet Earth and is armed with all the tools to dispatch harmony on our poor souls. Unfortunately it is only a movie. Mary Poppins is a character every child needs to be able to call upon. Rather her than Santa Claus.

    I'd like to think that I've seen a lot of movies, of varying quality and genre; enough to believe I have at least a basic grasp of cinema as a whole. But during all the classics and tripe I've endured over the years, Mary Poppins has somehow managed to evade me. I was too busy watching rabbits getting torn to pieces in Watership Down (1978) and clapping giddily at Rocky Balboa's training montage in Rocky (1976) as a child to be distracted by something quite as colourful as this.

Why not focus on all the magical things she can do and will do to help educate and bring up the children? There must be more than magical room-cleaning... What annoyed me most was the 'Jolly holly day with Mary'-song which went on and on and on. Every time I thought the stupid song was over, it started again and it just put the story on hold. Sadly enough, this movie was made back in those days when musical songs did not yet carry the story and unraveled extra plot elements but when songs were a detour. And what are penguins doing in this movie anyway? It's like they wanted to show off with what they were able to do at the expense of the story. So I hate to say this as I'm a big Disney fan! (But that doesn't mean I'll blindly love every single one of the movies) I really didn't like Mary Poppins. Give it a shot. Maybe you will... but I sure didn't. One day, I'd like to give it another shot but not for at least ten years. I'd probably like Nanny McPhee turned into animation but Mary Poppins is just not for me...

    Mary Poppins is one of those films that works on every level its been given. This was the film that Walt Disney dedicated most of his life and career to get made. He and his exceptional team of geniuses lifted the characters and some story from P.L. Traver's "good" book and transformed it into something that will stand the test of time. The story is about the dysfunctional Banks family in Edwardian London. The children Jane and Michael are rambunctious and keep annoying nannies out of the house. The parents, George and Winifred, are good people but are way too focused on their profession and causes to notice that the kids just want their love. Then comes Mary Poppins on her flying umbrella. She is a sweet but still stern lady who takes the kids on these whimsical adventures and sings catchy songs. But she's there for more than that (something way deeper), she is there to help mend the broken family. What makes great characters is a great cast, and that movie has it all. Julie Andrews (in her film debut) gives one of the best heroines ever put to screen. She is "prctically perfect in every way." Dick Van Dyke gives a very funny and at times touching performance as her jack-of-all-trades cockney companion Bert. David Tomlinson gives possibly one of my favorite performances in any movie as Mr. Banks. You see his journey over the course of the film and the moment is beautiful when he realizes that his kids and his wife are more important than what his bosses (played memorably by Arthur Malet and Dick van Dyke in heavy makeup) at the bank tell him and what he thought was important. And Glynis Johns gives a funny performance as the chipper suffragette Mrs. Banks. The story and score are something to behold. This is one of the best thought out of any Disney movie before or since (except Beauty and the Beast) Writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi concocted a story full of whimsy, sweetness, and surprisingly, very good drama. And then the Sherman Brother's score adds to the timeless quality of the film. There are showstoppers ("Supercalifragilistiexpialidocious" and "A Spoonful of Sugar") but the ones I like are either subtle or just fun to watch and listen to, "Step in Time, "A Man has Dreams," and the best song of the movie "Feed the Birds" (which features a great cameo by the great Jane Darwell) The song gives away Mary Poppins' message, which is that the small things in life are important, and family love is the ultimate gift for any person young or old. The man who also held this all together and mixed them in a beautiful way was long time Disney director Robert Stevenson, knowing just when to blend lightness and whimsy with pathos and drama. Then there are the special effects. This is one of the first movies I saw where I was blown away (even as a little kid) because i thought it was all real. It's one of those films that uses special effects to tell the story, not to distract the viewer. Nowhere is this more evident than artist Peter Ellenshaw's masterpiece matte paintings. They are warm, nostalgia, and thoroughly convincing. The animated sequence is fun too, with the waiter penguins being the best part of that whole adventure This is Walt Disney's best film, and was hailed as such when it premiered in August 1964. His fingerprints were all over this film too, as he made really good contributions to the story and characters (he was the one who made the animated waiters Penguins, Brilliant!) The reviews and box office numbers were all outstanding. Then it was nominated for a staggering 13 Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and won 5 Oscars, including Best Actress for Julie Andrews. Regrettably it did not win Best Picture, but it still has endured forever in the hearts and minds of children and adults who have seen it. Like the title of my review suggests, this is one of my all time favorite movies. And this is one of the films that inspired my interest in filmmaking, and one I will always look to with affection. I will be watching this many more times, and never get tired of it.

    Walt Disney was one of the most iconic figures of the twentieth century. He left a legacy behind filled with classic, unforgettable films like "Show White," "Sleeping Beauty" and "101 Dalmatians." With "Mary Poppins," however, he reached his zenith and produced perhaps the greatest musical ever made, a beautiful film for both adults and children. While the movie doesn't exactly do justice to the wonderful P.L. Travers' books, its originality and charm is as magical as Mary Poppins herself. Julie Andrews is perfect for the title role; pretty but cold and firm. Dick Van Dyke really shines here as Bert the chimney sweep; it's perhaps the only time he was allowed to display the full extent of his prodigious talents. Andrews and Van Dyke clearly have a great chemistry together. Disney filled "Mary Poppins" with top notch character actors, like Reta Shaw, Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher and Ed Wynn. Reginald Owen is a treat as Admiral Boom, along with Jane Darwell as the old lady behind one of the many unforgettable songs in the film, "Feed The Birds." Glynis Johns is cute as a very innocent suffragette, and David Tomlinson plays the role of distracted father/crusty banker to the hilt. But it's the songs that really make "Mary Poppins" so special. Every Baby Boomer knows them by heart; my personal favorite is the soaring (no pun intended), "Let's Go Fly A Kite." The film deserved all the accolades and praise it earned, and it remains one of the finest films in motion picture history.

    I have to admit that it's rather miraculous that I am able to remember a few of the first movies that I've ever seen as a child. I am able to recall seeing Disney films like Cinderella (1950) and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) for the first time at a very early age. So it's no surprise that I'm still able to recall seeing Mary Poppins (1964) for the first time at a young age and remembering how special an experience it was. What makes it all the more memorable is that I still enjoy Mary Poppins looking back at it as an adult just as much as I did when I saw it as a kid. In my opinion, that's the key ingredient regarding what makes a children's film timeless in the first place. We follow an unhappy British family led by Mr. and Mrs. Banks (David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns respectively) during the 1910s that are looking to hire a new nanny after their most recent one (Elsa Lanchester) quit. What they get is a magical nanny by the name of Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews in her amazing, Oscar-winning theatrical debut) who changes the entire family's lives forever. The kids (Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber) are taken on adventures beyond their wildest dreams such as jumping into chalk drawings, cleaning their room with the snap of their fingers, and other similar outings which are more magical than they sound. Joining with them on their adventures is an upbeat jack-of- all-trades by the name of Bert (Dick Van Dyke in a highly joyful role). This film basically covers Mary's time with the family until the "wind changes direction", both literally and metaphorically. What is fascinating about the story for this family film is that it teaches lessons not only to children, but also to adults. In its own unique way, it basically tells every family to meet in the middle between what the children expect from their parents and what the parents expect from their children. That means that parents should be more understanding of their children's playfulness and children should only have so much of a good thing. That's exactly the type of family dynamic that Mary Poppins tries to teach the entire Banks family through her own mysterious yet somehow wise actions. It is a profound and meaningful dynamic for any family to learn and strive for, and it's one crucial reason why Mary Poppins is still an original and unique family picture almost 50 years since it first came out. But of course, it isn't the only reason why I still love Mary Poppins now. Looking back at it again, I just picked up on how funny, witty and charming this movie really is. At times, the humor bares comparison with some of the greatest comedies of the 20th century like Duck Soup (1933) and Modern Times (1936). Other times, I was displaying an affectionate smile either for the terrific lines of dialogue made possible by writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi or recalling just how cool and charming every scene is. Remember the scene with Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) floating up in the air because he's laughing so hard? Remember the chimney sweeps (including Bert) doing some dangerous dancing on the rooftops? This film contains just one great scene after another and at a running time of more than 2 hours, it all moves exceedingly well. If that isn't a compliment to Walt Disney's master storytelling, I don't know what is. I briefly mentioned earlier that this was Julie Andrews' acting debut as the main character Mary Poppins and considering that she won an Oscar for her first performance, it's an impressive way to start out her career. Between her superb singing skills, her comfort in the role, and her overall excellent delivery, I can definitely see why she earned the Oscar. I know Dick Van Dyke has received criticism for his British accent, but to be brutally honest, I never saw the problem because I don't know anything about true Cockney accents. I honestly loved Dick Van Dyke in this movie regardless. I thought he had charm and wit to spare, he worked very well with the kids, he always had a positive attitude, he was highly entertaining overall. Even David Tomlinson is outstanding as Mr. Banks. For me, this is the strict parental figure done right. He may be able to tolerate the playfulness of his children for a very limited time, but the filmmakers still made a likable character out of him and somehow make his stubbornness funny. I think we all know how great the music and songs written by Richard and Robert Sherman are here. We all remember the song "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and the meaning of that unorthodox word. It's practically a word that's used when there's nothing else to say, and there's nothing else I can say about that word except..the word. How do you like that? There's a reason why this film is one of the only 2 Disney movies to be on the list of the AFI's 25 Greatest Musicals. The fact that it's filled with timeless songs such as "A Spoonful of Sugar", "I Love to Laugh" and the Oscar-winning "Chim Chim Cheree" should explain enough. They're cheerful, they're memorable, they're catchy, the songs and music are basically everything you could ask for from a musical. Mary Poppins easily takes its place amongst the finest films that Disney has ever put out. The story flows very well at 139 minutes and the fact that it moves more efficiently than most films of that running time is further proof of Mr. Disney's master skills as a storyteller. The music, the acting, the characters, the writing and even some of the special effects all come together in a wonderful family film that is "practically perfect in every way".

    Just for a moment, think of all those movies about monsters and manifestations of evil. There is the creature in Alien, the machine in Terminator, Predator and the various zombie movies, blood sucking vampire movies, movies with representations of the devil in various forms, including Al Pacino, and all the other incarnate creatures of hell. Have you ever wondered why all the creatures of supposed evil are so ghastly, armed with sharp teeth, claws and mouths that emit flames? Why do they require this weaponry? You understand why when you look at their opponents; they have to take on the likes of Mary Poppins. Mary Poppins is essentially a white witch. And she is awesomely powerful. Every time I watch a clip of "A Spoon Full Of Sugar" it sends shivers up my spine and makes me realise just how seriously omnipotent this lady is. If Mary Poppins was offended by the behaviour of Alien, Predator, Al Pacino's devil and the fury of the Incredible Hulk all at the same time, she would have them wearing nappies and a bib with a click of her fingers. Mary Poppins is God's white Protestant representative on planet Earth and is armed with all the tools to dispatch harmony on our poor souls. Unfortunately it is only a movie. Mary Poppins is a character every child needs to be able to call upon. Rather her than Santa Claus.

    I'd like to think that I've seen a lot of movies, of varying quality and genre; enough to believe I have at least a basic grasp of cinema as a whole. But during all the classics and tripe I've endured over the years, Mary Poppins has somehow managed to evade me. I was too busy watching rabbits getting torn to pieces in Watership Down (1978) and clapping giddily at Rocky Balboa's training montage in Rocky (1976) as a child to be distracted by something quite as colourful as this. So, it's at the ripe old age of 28 that I came round to sitting through Mary Poppins, to struggle through its squeaky-clean visage and many, many songs that I somehow knew all the words to before seeing the film. Well, I was wrong to be so cynical, as although the film is hardly what I would call a classic, it's really rather good. London, 1910. Merry jack-of-all-trades Bert (Dick Van Dyke) is playing a one-man-band to an enthusiastic street audience when he senses something magical in the air, signalling the return of his good friend Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews). He takes us into the stable yet unhappy Banks' family home, where the household is ran by lord-of-his-castle Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson), and his suffragette wife Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns). Busy attending to work and other matters, the Banks' have started to neglect their children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber). After their umpteenth nanny walks out on them, Mr. Banks makes a desperate newspaper plea for a nanny who will lay down the law, and teach the children respect and the harshness of life. So enters Mary Poppins, 'perfect in every way', a nanny who is as strict as she needs to be but one capable of also showing the children the joys of life. Mary Poppins suffers mainly from the same thing that I feel plagues most musicals - it's too long. Seemingly every musical feels the need to round-up every change of emotion and sub-plot with a grand song-and- dance number that gets old quickly. The first half of the film is pure family entertainment, with memorable songs and some stunning special effects (for its day) making the film zip by happily. Then the songs get more clunky and forgettable, and we are exposed to much more of Dick Van Dyke's terrible accent and his grating, over-enthusiastic Bert than we need (although I'm sure he has his many fans). Yet after the somewhat exhausting 139 minutes is over, Poppins still leaves you with that cuddly feeling inside, something I thought had died inside me when I sprouted my first pube. Most of the success of Poppins comes from the performance of Julie Andrews. All sweet and idyllic, she could have come across as a stuck-up Miss Perfect, but Andrews' effortless likability and stage experience makes her more of a supernatural missionary, sent to make a stand against Mr. Banks' stern and rigid outlook on life. Disney were really coming out of their Golden Era at the time of this being released, but it's still one of their most fondly remembered, and certainly their most critically successful live-action efforts. It's more than likely that children will turn away from it, due to the mega-bucks spewed into children's films these days, but it will continue to enchant adults, especially those that grew up with it, and even those new to it, like me. Chim-chimernee, chim-ernee, chim chim, cheroo! Damn it, it's in my head again!

    Even as a 9-year-old in 1965, I knew that this movie was awful. Julie Andrews was all wrong for the part of Mary Poppins, and the animation was flawed and cheesy. The book's author, P.L. Travers, soon regretted collaborating with Disney on this project. She begged him to leave out the animation, and cast someone more appropriate in the title role. Disney, the bastard, turned on his heel and said "Pamela, that ship has sailed." He refused to make any of the changes back to her original book. The result was a horrible adaptation that Travers was bitter about until the day she died. Disney was a nasty piece of work. "Alice in Wonderland" was another story he ruined. Rot in hell, Mr. Disney!

    I first saw this film over 20 years ago back in the days when they had the video player, this is a film I liked better when I got older. This film is about Mary Poppins being a Nanny to two children Jane and Michael (played by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) after the nanny leaves because the kids had ran away. There are good songs in this, my favourite songs has to be 'I Love To Laugh' and 'Feed The Bird. My favourite scenes are Mary Poppins singing Feed The Birds and A Spoonful Of Sugar. When I was younger I found the scene when the old man from the bank (played by Dick Van Dyke) dying laughing disturbing but it doesn't bother me much now I am older.

    and it is enough. because its charm is fresh. its songs - adorable. its science to transform a book in a fairy - tale, with each regular ingredient at perfect place, with cartoons, good actors and slices of extraordinary adventures is a great virtue. a classic. but in a form very special. because its message is more important today. the nice special effects, the shining Julie Andrews, the performance of children and, in same time, the music. a magic film about magic and seed for a wave, not exactly small of films about powerful/seductive nannies. so, must see it again ! because it is not only a beautiful film or a wise story. it is a gift. and heart for state of spirit.

    I Watched this movie on GO and online but mostly on DVD. I did not get the point of the movie because it was all mixed and not that entertaining, however the music was perfect and a spoonful of sugar ha ha. One of the most cool thing in this movie was how you get to feel the wonders and thoughts in the characters minds and hearts which was truly mad and fun. Another Its a very long movie with lots of colours and funny graphics, however it did not have any movie texture or any scenes which didn't have utter nonsense. I would recommend this movie to people whom love and admire magical tales and flying in the air blah blah.

    I always wanted to see Mary Poppins as the idea of a magical nanny really appealed to me and I have to admit that the animation is pretty amazing for its time but the story is usually what interests me most and the problem I had is that I watched this movie after I'd seen Nanny McPhee. I thought it would be an original story with great songs. I already loved the 'Spoon full of sugar'-song and the Supercallifragi-song as I had lots of Disney CD's before I watched the movie. So I convinced two people to watch it together with me as it's a classic. And we were about halfway when everybody looked at each other and said: "Do you still like this?" And we all had to admit we were really annoyed, not only bored but actually annoyed with the story. Sure there is lots of potential in a story about a magical nanny! And still, there is no real story, no story that keeps you tied to the screen anyway. We sat through the whole movie (again, because it's a classic) but we all didn't really enjoy it. I was actually bothered by a few questions afterwards: Why is that stupid Dick Van Dyke-character in this movie? Why put all these chimney sweepers and distract us from the really interesting character (or you would expect so anyway): Mary Poppins. It's the title of the movie! Why not focus on all the magical things she can do and will do to help educate and bring up the children? There must be more than magical room-cleaning...

The kids (Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber) are taken on adventures beyond their wildest dreams such as jumping into chalk drawings, cleaning their room with the snap of their fingers, and other similar outings which are more magical than they sound. Joining with them on their adventures is an upbeat jack-of- all-trades by the name of Bert (Dick Van Dyke in a highly joyful role). This film basically covers Mary's time with the family until the "wind changes direction", both literally and metaphorically. What is fascinating about the story for this family film is that it teaches lessons not only to children, but also to adults. In its own unique way, it basically tells every family to meet in the middle between what the children expect from their parents and what the parents expect from their children. That means that parents should be more understanding of their children's playfulness and children should only have so much of a good thing. That's exactly the type of family dynamic that Mary Poppins tries to teach the entire Banks family through her own mysterious yet somehow wise actions. It is a profound and meaningful dynamic for any family to learn and strive for, and it's one crucial reason why Mary Poppins is still an original and unique family picture almost 50 years since it first came out. But of course, it isn't the only reason why I still love Mary Poppins now. Looking back at it again, I just picked up on how funny, witty and charming this movie really is. At times, the humor bares comparison with some of the greatest comedies of the 20th century like Duck Soup (1933) and Modern Times (1936). Other times, I was displaying an affectionate smile either for the terrific lines of dialogue made possible by writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi or recalling just how cool and charming every scene is. Remember the scene with Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) floating up in the air because he's laughing so hard? Remember the chimney sweeps (including Bert) doing some dangerous dancing on the rooftops? This film contains just one great scene after another and at a running time of more than 2 hours, it all moves exceedingly well. If that isn't a compliment to Walt Disney's master storytelling, I don't know what is. I briefly mentioned earlier that this was Julie Andrews' acting debut as the main character Mary Poppins and considering that she won an Oscar for her first performance, it's an impressive way to start out her career. Between her superb singing skills, her comfort in the role, and her overall excellent delivery, I can definitely see why she earned the Oscar. I know Dick Van Dyke has received criticism for his British accent, but to be brutally honest, I never saw the problem because I don't know anything about true Cockney accents. I honestly loved Dick Van Dyke in this movie regardless. I thought he had charm and wit to spare, he worked very well with the kids, he always had a positive attitude, he was highly entertaining overall. Even David Tomlinson is outstanding as Mr. Banks. For me, this is the strict parental figure done right. He may be able to tolerate the playfulness of his children for a very limited time, but the filmmakers still made a likable character out of him and somehow make his stubbornness funny. I think we all know how great the music and songs written by Richard and Robert Sherman are here. We all remember the song "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and the meaning of that unorthodox word. It's practically a word that's used when there's nothing else to say, and there's nothing else I can say about that word except..the word. How do you like that? There's a reason why this film is one of the only 2 Disney movies to be on the list of the AFI's 25 Greatest Musicals. The fact that it's filled with timeless songs such as "A Spoonful of Sugar", "I Love to Laugh" and the Oscar-winning "Chim Chim Cheree" should explain enough. They're cheerful, they're memorable, they're catchy, the songs and music are basically everything you could ask for from a musical. Mary Poppins easily takes its place amongst the finest films that Disney has ever put out. The story flows very well at 139 minutes and the fact that it moves more efficiently than most films of that running time is further proof of Mr. Disney's master skills as a storyteller. The music, the acting, the characters, the writing and even some of the special effects all come together in a wonderful family film that is "practically perfect in every way".

    Just for a moment, think of all those movies about monsters and manifestations of evil. There is the creature in Alien, the machine in Terminator, Predator and the various zombie movies, blood sucking vampire movies, movies with representations of the devil in various forms, including Al Pacino, and all the other incarnate creatures of hell. Have you ever wondered why all the creatures of supposed evil are so ghastly, armed with sharp teeth, claws and mouths that emit flames? Why do they require this weaponry? You understand why when you look at their opponents; they have to take on the likes of Mary Poppins. Mary Poppins is essentially a white witch. And she is awesomely powerful. Every time I watch a clip of "A Spoon Full Of Sugar" it sends shivers up my spine and makes me realise just how seriously omnipotent this lady is. If Mary Poppins was offended by the behaviour of Alien, Predator, Al Pacino's devil and the fury of the Incredible Hulk all at the same time, she would have them wearing nappies and a bib with a click of her fingers. Mary Poppins is God's white Protestant representative on planet Earth and is armed with all the tools to dispatch harmony on our poor souls. Unfortunately it is only a movie. Mary Poppins is a character every child needs to be able to call upon. Rather her than Santa Claus.

    I'd like to think that I've seen a lot of movies, of varying quality and genre; enough to believe I have at least a basic grasp of cinema as a whole. But during all the classics and tripe I've endured over the years, Mary Poppins has somehow managed to evade me. I was too busy watching rabbits getting torn to pieces in Watership Down (1978) and clapping giddily at Rocky Balboa's training montage in Rocky (1976) as a child to be distracted by something quite as colourful as this. So, it's at the ripe old age of 28 that I came round to sitting through Mary Poppins, to struggle through its squeaky-clean visage and many, many songs that I somehow knew all the words to before seeing the film. Well, I was wrong to be so cynical, as although the film is hardly what I would call a classic, it's really rather good. London, 1910. Merry jack-of-all-trades Bert (Dick Van Dyke) is playing a one-man-band to an enthusiastic street audience when he senses something magical in the air, signalling the return of his good friend Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews). He takes us into the stable yet unhappy Banks' family home, where the household is ran by lord-of-his-castle Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson), and his suffragette wife Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns). Busy attending to work and other matters, the Banks' have started to neglect their children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber). After their umpteenth nanny walks out on them, Mr. Banks makes a desperate newspaper plea for a nanny who will lay down the law, and teach the children respect and the harshness of life. So enters Mary Poppins, 'perfect in every way', a nanny who is as strict as she needs to be but one capable of also showing the children the joys of life. Mary Poppins suffers mainly from the same thing that I feel plagues most musicals - it's too long. Seemingly every musical feels the need to round-up every change of emotion and sub-plot with a grand song-and- dance number that gets old quickly. The first half of the film is pure family entertainment, with memorable songs and some stunning special effects (for its day) making the film zip by happily. Then the songs get more clunky and forgettable, and we are exposed to much more of Dick Van Dyke's terrible accent and his grating, over-enthusiastic Bert than we need (although I'm sure he has his many fans). Yet after the somewhat exhausting 139 minutes is over, Poppins still leaves you with that cuddly feeling inside, something I thought had died inside me when I sprouted my first pube. Most of the success of Poppins comes from the performance of Julie Andrews. All sweet and idyllic, she could have come across as a stuck-up Miss Perfect, but Andrews' effortless likability and stage experience makes her more of a supernatural missionary, sent to make a stand against Mr. Banks' stern and rigid outlook on life. Disney were really coming out of their Golden Era at the time of this being released, but it's still one of their most fondly remembered, and certainly their most critically successful live-action efforts. It's more than likely that children will turn away from it, due to the mega-bucks spewed into children's films these days, but it will continue to enchant adults, especially those that grew up with it, and even those new to it, like me. Chim-chimernee, chim-ernee, chim chim, cheroo! Damn it, it's in my head again!

    Even as a 9-year-old in 1965, I knew that this movie was awful. Julie Andrews was all wrong for the part of Mary Poppins, and the animation was flawed and cheesy. The book's author, P.L. Travers, soon regretted collaborating with Disney on this project. She begged him to leave out the animation, and cast someone more appropriate in the title role. Disney, the bastard, turned on his heel and said "Pamela, that ship has sailed." He refused to make any of the changes back to her original book. The result was a horrible adaptation that Travers was bitter about until the day she died. Disney was a nasty piece of work. "Alice in Wonderland" was another story he ruined. Rot in hell, Mr. Disney!

    I first saw this film over 20 years ago back in the days when they had the video player, this is a film I liked better when I got older. This film is about Mary Poppins being a Nanny to two children Jane and Michael (played by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) after the nanny leaves because the kids had ran away. There are good songs in this, my favourite songs has to be 'I Love To Laugh' and 'Feed The Bird. My favourite scenes are Mary Poppins singing Feed The Birds and A Spoonful Of Sugar. When I was younger I found the scene when the old man from the bank (played by Dick Van Dyke) dying laughing disturbing but it doesn't bother me much now I am older.

    and it is enough. because its charm is fresh. its songs - adorable. its science to transform a book in a fairy - tale, with each regular ingredient at perfect place, with cartoons, good actors and slices of extraordinary adventures is a great virtue. a classic. but in a form very special. because its message is more important today. the nice special effects, the shining Julie Andrews, the performance of children and, in same time, the music. a magic film about magic and seed for a wave, not exactly small of films about powerful/seductive nannies. so, must see it again ! because it is not only a beautiful film or a wise story. it is a gift. and heart for state of spirit.
