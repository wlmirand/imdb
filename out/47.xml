    An amazing piece delicately made by the master craftsman of cinema "Tim Burton" ... The film is a gift to moviegoers nostalgic of 7th art.. One of the contemporary works most faithful to the teachings of the old school Hollywood movie without a doubt is a great film that will shine forever in the hearts of lovers the classic film black and white. Ed Wood is a film material that should be used as a teaching tool and incorporated in the Institutes of vocational training of filmmakers, so that the new generations of directors, learn the craft of the 7th art familiarizing with old techniques and narrative structures of film classic. .

    Now here is one of the great films about making....films. For those who don't know, Ed Wood is known to be not one of the, but the worst director of all time. This film celebrates his legacy with great love and respect. Tim Burton is one who, in my personal opinion has never made a truly great movie. That was until I saw Ed Wood. Speaking of Ed Wood his character is portrayed by Johnny Depp. Despite me claiming that Johnny Depp is an overrated actor, his performance in this film is so good, it almost made me respect Ed Wood as one of the greats. By that I mean that Depp shows how much this man loved his work that it almost makes you love his work too. One of my favorite lines is when Ed Wood is in a waiting room explaining to a lady, his future wife, about his profession in life....and he compares himself to the great Orson Welles. Now while this may seem ridiculous to most, just the way Depp explains this makes you think, Hey! Ya know, that really makes sense. That is because it is so true. Ed wood is the B version of Orson Welles....actually, make that the D version of Orson Welles. There is one line that truly sums up Ed Woods legacy. That line is towards the end of the film during the premiere of Plan 9 From Outer Space when Ed Wood says, "This is what I'll be remembered for."

    Ed Wood is often called one of the worst directors of all time, if not THE worst. His films suffered from laughably poor production quality, continuity errors and sub-par acting. Usually, we as the viewers, mock these flaws in films such as these but we rarely ever think about the work that was put into them or what the people behind them are like as individuals. In this film based on Ed Wood himself, follows the making of his three most infamous films, Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space and shows all the trials and troubles he had to go through to get these films made as well as his relationships with the actors, crew and in his personal life, most notably with famous horror star Bela Lugosi. Rather than make fun of Ed Wood or his work, the film instead portrays him as an ambitious young film maker who might be a little too ambitious for his own good. It's a more human look at him, almost on a personal level. Ed is played by Johnny Depp, who does a fantastic job as portraying him as both funny and sympathetic. You root for him all the way and feel his sadness and disappointment when things do not turn out as expected for him. Even though Depp acts well in the film, as do the other actors for that matter, the person who steals the show is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau plays the part to a tee and, much like Depp, plays him both funny and sympathetically only better in my opinion. The story alone is inspiring to anyone who is or was ever interested in doing something creative, especially film making. The final scene with Plan 9 playing in the theatre as Ed looks on, his face beaming with such happiness and mouthing the words he wrote and by the end he doesn't even seem to care what other people think about it but rather he is content with seeing his vision come alive. I should probably also mention that the film is not really entirely accurate to Ed Wood's real life but I feel if it was entirely accurate, the film wouldn't be as good. The only real flaw I can think of off the top of my head is that at the very end the film gives us a slide-show of all the characters and what has become of their real life counterparts and some of them are pretty sad to think about for such an uplifting movie, especially Ed himself, but that's very minor and the rest of the film is so good, I don't really mind. So, the next time you mock a film for not being up to your standards, think a little of the people behind it and the troubles they all went through to see it come to fruition. Then maybe, just a little, you can begin to appreciate film a whole lot more. I know I did after I saw Ed Wood.

    Despite the good play of Johnny Depp and even the better of the older actor, the film is quite slow. And on top - black and white. The story takes us to the early years of the last century in Hollywood. Young director looking for a way to break into show business using every opportunity to do it. Accidentally introduced to adult actor, former celebrity but current addict. (although nice image). After many difficulties which they experience together - several unsuccessful films, the separation of the young director with his girlfriend and finding new one, the young director manages to make a film about the lives of everyone around him and the process of filming movies. So he became director of the protagonist in the film. This movie shows how important it is to not give up on what you want to do, regardless of how old you are. The road is not all easy, but you always can find collaborators who will help you and who will believe in you. The movie hints the moment in which everyone has an oddity that must simply be accepted, because it makes him exactly the way he is. Ultimately all ranks well.

    Ed Wood, which is not totally a non-fiction film, is a wonderful portrayal of man who has multiple personalities, found it hard to get money, and is a guy who was voted "Worst Director of All Time." This film is often funny and amusing, but is not devoid of Tim Burton's trademark strangeness. This film captures the decade of the 1950's very well thanks to the use of black and white. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this film was produced back in the 1950's. Burton's film is about the director Ed Wood as he enters the most productive years of his life. Wood happens to be a man who is fond of wearing women's clothing and deeply idolizes Bela Lugosi, the star of the original Dracula film. Wood, with the help of Lugosi, goes on to make some monumental films. The acting is very good in the film. Even though Johnny Depp pairs up with Burton way too much, he delivers a surprisingly comical performance that seems straight from the heart. Martin Landau is brilliant as Bela and delivers one heck of a performance. There are some other great characters especially the humorous performances by Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones. Overall, this is a great film that works very well with the black and white coloring. This film has a heart and I loved the way it explains the relationship between Ed and Bela. This film has gotten me interested in Ed Wood, and I may have to check out his "bad" films to form my own opinions. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your typical Tim Burton film. I rate this film 9/10.

    I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp, and usually my favorite movies he does are collaborated with Tim Burton. I was hesitant to see this one because it looked like it would be boring, and I noticed that it was in black and white. I normally can't stand when movies made in a time when we have the technology for color are in black and white. This was the exception. This movie is honestly amazingly done. If you're hesitant to watch, don't be. It's very entertaining and exceptionally acted. I really shocked myself with how much i liked it. This is by far the best Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie I've seen (and I've seen them all). 10/10, I would absolutely recommend it.

This is a touching and comic tribute to a Hollywood maverick , a cross-dressing , angora-sweater wearing director, concentrating on the best-known period of his life in the 1950s, when lack of financing and repeated failures led to make a lot of bad films , in spite of Wood's optimism and vitality .

    This is the one Tim Burton ought to be remembered for. If this isn't an homage to Ed Wood, I don't know what it is. An optimistic telling of a pessimistic life. To put it in perspective, Ed Wood (1994) is like Edward Scissorhands (1990) minus the Dr. Seuss in terms of feels - attributable in large due to the Burton-Depp collaboration. The film itself doesn't have elements of non-realism, yet it is fantastical because it follows a quirky, lacking man's hopeful pursuits alongside his quirky, lacking friends, portrayed through fittingly quirky, contrastingly masterful cinematography. The plot is admittedly not riveting but interesting and heartening enough, but above all, Burton's execution of this unlikely film is what makes it "the one (he'll) be remembered for"... at least for me.

    i watched every Burton film so i think i know what i'm talking about when i say this gem is his finest work because unlike his other films there are no exaggerated over the top makeup and costumes and the characters although so weird feel so real and close to the audience, the cast is perfect portraying characters different from what they're used to especially the old brilliant actor playing bella lagusi, and johny Depp once again proves he's a winning horse, he held such an iconic, heavy, crazy but normal character and he convinced me he's Mr wood coming back to life, the depiction of Hollywood life and L.A at that time is perfectly done but the only draw back for me which didn't take away from the film is the white and black color i know it was important for the movie and maybe helped convince us but i didn't like it that much. finally i think this film really proves what a great authentic and smart director Tim Burton is

    The life and work of the legendary 'worst director of all time', Edward D. Wood Jr. Concentrating on the best-known period of his life in the 1950s, when he made Glen or Glenda (1953), Bride of the Monster (1955) and Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959). And focusing on both his transvestism and his touching friendship with the once great but now ageing and unemployed horror star Bela Lugosi.... Even thought he film is almost twenty years old, it's easily one of the finest and weirdest Bio-Pics ever made. Depp has never been better suited to a role, and proves here he is much more than Jack Sparrow, and it's a shame he will be best remembered for that awful series of movies. Of all the films that Burton and Depp have made together, this is the most daring and fun. Edward scissorhands is good, but the variety of characters were not there. Charlie and the Chocolate was fun too, but Depp was just channelling Marilyn Mansons inner child. It's ironic that a Black and White movie would have Burtons most colourful characters of his movies, and it's a movie that wants you to watch bad movies, very bad movies, that have to be seen to be believed. And when a film maker does that, you know the guy is in his prime. the support is amazing, and Jones, Murray and Landau are just amazing when on screen. But Depp is the heart and the soul of the movie, really putting his all in this. A great companion piece to watch with dark shadows...

    This is the one Tim Burton ought to be remembered for. If this isn't an homage to Ed Wood, I don't know what it is. An optimistic telling of a pessimistic life. To put it in perspective, Ed Wood (1994) is like Edward Scissorhands (1990) minus the Dr. Seuss in terms of feels - attributable in large due to the Burton-Depp collaboration. The film itself doesn't have elements of non-realism, yet it is fantastical because it follows a quirky, lacking man's hopeful pursuits alongside his quirky, lacking friends, portrayed through fittingly quirky, contrastingly masterful cinematography. The plot is admittedly not riveting but interesting and heartening enough, but above all, Burton's execution of this unlikely film is what makes it "the one (he'll) be remembered for"... at least for me.

    i watched every Burton film so i think i know what i'm talking about when i say this gem is his finest work because unlike his other films there are no exaggerated over the top makeup and costumes and the characters although so weird feel so real and close to the audience, the cast is perfect portraying characters different from what they're used to especially the old brilliant actor playing bella lagusi, and johny Depp once again proves he's a winning horse, he held such an iconic, heavy, crazy but normal character and he convinced me he's Mr wood coming back to life, the depiction of Hollywood life and L.A at that time is perfectly done but the only draw back for me which didn't take away from the film is the white and black color i know it was important for the movie and maybe helped convince us but i didn't like it that much. finally i think this film really proves what a great authentic and smart director Tim Burton is

    The life and work of the legendary 'worst director of all time', Edward D. Wood Jr. Concentrating on the best-known period of his life in the 1950s, when he made Glen or Glenda (1953), Bride of the Monster (1955) and Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959). And focusing on both his transvestism and his touching friendship with the once great but now ageing and unemployed horror star Bela Lugosi.... Even thought he film is almost twenty years old, it's easily one of the finest and weirdest Bio-Pics ever made. Depp has never been better suited to a role, and proves here he is much more than Jack Sparrow, and it's a shame he will be best remembered for that awful series of movies. Of all the films that Burton and Depp have made together, this is the most daring and fun. Edward scissorhands is good, but the variety of characters were not there. Charlie and the Chocolate was fun too, but Depp was just channelling Marilyn Mansons inner child. It's ironic that a Black and White movie would have Burtons most colourful characters of his movies, and it's a movie that wants you to watch bad movies, very bad movies, that have to be seen to be believed. And when a film maker does that, you know the guy is in his prime. the support is amazing, and Jones, Murray and Landau are just amazing when on screen. But Depp is the heart and the soul of the movie, really putting his all in this. A great companion piece to watch with dark shadows...

    Now here is one of the great films about making....films. For those who don't know, Ed Wood is known to be not one of the, but the worst director of all time. This film celebrates his legacy with great love and respect. Tim Burton is one who, in my personal opinion has never made a truly great movie. That was until I saw Ed Wood. Speaking of Ed Wood his character is portrayed by Johnny Depp. Despite me claiming that Johnny Depp is an overrated actor, his performance in this film is so good, it almost made me respect Ed Wood as one of the greats. By that I mean that Depp shows how much this man loved his work that it almost makes you love his work too. One of my favorite lines is when Ed Wood is in a waiting room explaining to a lady, his future wife, about his profession in life....and he compares himself to the great Orson Welles. Now while this may seem ridiculous to most, just the way Depp explains this makes you think, Hey! Ya know, that really makes sense. That is because it is so true. Ed wood is the B version of Orson Welles....actually, make that the D version of Orson Welles. There is one line that truly sums up Ed Woods legacy. That line is towards the end of the film during the premiere of Plan 9 From Outer Space when Ed Wood says, "This is what I'll be remembered for."

    Ed Wood is often called one of the worst directors of all time, if not THE worst. His films suffered from laughably poor production quality, continuity errors and sub-par acting. Usually, we as the viewers, mock these flaws in films such as these but we rarely ever think about the work that was put into them or what the people behind them are like as individuals. In this film based on Ed Wood himself, follows the making of his three most infamous films, Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space and shows all the trials and troubles he had to go through to get these films made as well as his relationships with the actors, crew and in his personal life, most notably with famous horror star Bela Lugosi. Rather than make fun of Ed Wood or his work, the film instead portrays him as an ambitious young film maker who might be a little too ambitious for his own good. It's a more human look at him, almost on a personal level. Ed is played by Johnny Depp, who does a fantastic job as portraying him as both funny and sympathetic. You root for him all the way and feel his sadness and disappointment when things do not turn out as expected for him. Even though Depp acts well in the film, as do the other actors for that matter, the person who steals the show is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau plays the part to a tee and, much like Depp, plays him both funny and sympathetically only better in my opinion. The story alone is inspiring to anyone who is or was ever interested in doing something creative, especially film making. The final scene with Plan 9 playing in the theatre as Ed looks on, his face beaming with such happiness and mouthing the words he wrote and by the end he doesn't even seem to care what other people think about it but rather he is content with seeing his vision come alive. I should probably also mention that the film is not really entirely accurate to Ed Wood's real life but I feel if it was entirely accurate, the film wouldn't be as good. The only real flaw I can think of off the top of my head is that at the very end the film gives us a slide-show of all the characters and what has become of their real life counterparts and some of them are pretty sad to think about for such an uplifting movie, especially Ed himself, but that's very minor and the rest of the film is so good, I don't really mind. So, the next time you mock a film for not being up to your standards, think a little of the people behind it and the troubles they all went through to see it come to fruition. Then maybe, just a little, you can begin to appreciate film a whole lot more. I know I did after I saw Ed Wood.

    Despite the good play of Johnny Depp and even the better of the older actor, the film is quite slow. And on top - black and white. The story takes us to the early years of the last century in Hollywood. Young director looking for a way to break into show business using every opportunity to do it. Accidentally introduced to adult actor, former celebrity but current addict. (although nice image). After many difficulties which they experience together - several unsuccessful films, the separation of the young director with his girlfriend and finding new one, the young director manages to make a film about the lives of everyone around him and the process of filming movies. So he became director of the protagonist in the film. This movie shows how important it is to not give up on what you want to do, regardless of how old you are. The road is not all easy, but you always can find collaborators who will help you and who will believe in you. The movie hints the moment in which everyone has an oddity that must simply be accepted, because it makes him exactly the way he is. Ultimately all ranks well.

    Ed Wood, which is not totally a non-fiction film, is a wonderful portrayal of man who has multiple personalities, found it hard to get money, and is a guy who was voted "Worst Director of All Time." This film is often funny and amusing, but is not devoid of Tim Burton's trademark strangeness. This film captures the decade of the 1950's very well thanks to the use of black and white. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this film was produced back in the 1950's. Burton's film is about the director Ed Wood as he enters the most productive years of his life. Wood happens to be a man who is fond of wearing women's clothing and deeply idolizes Bela Lugosi, the star of the original Dracula film. Wood, with the help of Lugosi, goes on to make some monumental films. The acting is very good in the film. Even though Johnny Depp pairs up with Burton way too much, he delivers a surprisingly comical performance that seems straight from the heart. Martin Landau is brilliant as Bela and delivers one heck of a performance. There are some other great characters especially the humorous performances by Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones. Overall, this is a great film that works very well with the black and white coloring. This film has a heart and I loved the way it explains the relationship between Ed and Bela. This film has gotten me interested in Ed Wood, and I may have to check out his "bad" films to form my own opinions. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your typical Tim Burton film. I rate this film 9/10.

    I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp, and usually my favorite movies he does are collaborated with Tim Burton. I was hesitant to see this one because it looked like it would be boring, and I noticed that it was in black and white. I normally can't stand when movies made in a time when we have the technology for color are in black and white. This was the exception. This movie is honestly amazingly done. If you're hesitant to watch, don't be. It's very entertaining and exceptionally acted. I really shocked myself with how much i liked it. This is by far the best Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie I've seen (and I've seen them all). 10/10, I would absolutely recommend it.

    A biopic of the life and work of the legendary 'worst director of all time', 'Edward D. Wood Jr.' and who now occupies a lofty position as a cult icon ; being based on Rudolph Grey's book &uml;Nightmare of ecstasy : the life and art of Ed Wood&uml;. This is a touching and comic tribute to a Hollywood maverick , a cross-dressing , angora-sweater wearing director, concentrating on the best-known period of his life in the 1950s, when lack of financing and repeated failures led to make a lot of bad films , in spite of Wood's optimism and vitality . And focusing his relationship with Bela Lugosi and his rare troupe of actors . This is a mostly true story of the legendary director of awful pictures and his strange group of friends and actors . This is a splendid tribute by Tim Burton to bring to the screen the tale of a filmmaker many consider to be the worst of all time . Lavishly produced , in fact , this film cost more to produce than all of Edward D. Wood Jr.'s films put together . Tim Burton said that he was drawn to the story because of the similarities between Edward D. Wood Jr.'s relationship with Bela Lugosi , now ageing and unemployed horror star , and his own friendship with Vincent Price late in the actor's life . Burton focuses on Ed's relationship with Bela , whose career is over by the time Wood befriends him . Depp is extraordinary and engaging as Ed , the strange filmmaker whose Angora sweaters were his weakness , women were his inspiration and movies were his passion . Johnny Depp has said that his characterization of Edward D. Wood Jr. was a mixture of "the blind optimism of Ronald Reagan, the enthusiasm of the Tin Man from The Wizard of OZ and Casey Kasem." . Martin Landau's winning of the 'Best Supporting Actor' Academy Award for his portrayal of down-on-his-lucky Bela Lugosi marked the first time in Oscar history that a performer in any category won for playing an actual movie star . However , Bela Lugosi Jr.'s only objection to the film's portrayal of his father was his speech. In Lugosi's memory, his father never used foul language . Sensational support cast , the secondary actors are mostly convincing and enjoyable , almost every role has an appropriate resemblance to his or her Z-player counterpart and the performances are adequate such as Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller , Jeffrey Jones as Criswell , Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge , Max Casella as Paul Marco , Brent Hinkley as Conrad Brooks , Lisa Marie as Vampira , George 'The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson and Juliet Landau as Loretta King . Ed Wood was a low-budgeted auteur of such lousy actors and notoriously bad movies as &uml;Glen or Glenda&uml;, &uml;Bride of monster&uml; and &uml;Plan 9 from outer space&uml; . Agreeable musical score by Howard Shore , the sweeping music during the epilogue is based on the music from Glen or Glenda and being the first film by Tim Burton to not feature Danny Elfman's soundtrack . Evocative as well as luxurious cinematography in black and white by Stefan Czapsky . The motion picture was compelling and stunningly directed by Tim Burton . Rating : Better than average , well worth seeing . Essential and indispensable watching .

    This is the one Tim Burton ought to be remembered for. If this isn't an homage to Ed Wood, I don't know what it is. An optimistic telling of a pessimistic life. To put it in perspective, Ed Wood (1994) is like Edward Scissorhands (1990) minus the Dr. Seuss in terms of feels - attributable in large due to the Burton-Depp collaboration. The film itself doesn't have elements of non-realism, yet it is fantastical because it follows a quirky, lacking man's hopeful pursuits alongside his quirky, lacking friends, portrayed through fittingly quirky, contrastingly masterful cinematography. The plot is admittedly not riveting but interesting and heartening enough, but above all, Burton's execution of this unlikely film is what makes it "the one (he'll) be remembered for"... at least for me.

This is a splendid tribute by Tim Burton to bring to the screen the tale of a filmmaker many consider to be the worst of all time . Lavishly produced , in fact , this film cost more to produce than all of Edward D. Wood Jr.'s films put together .

Martin Landau's winning of the 'Best Supporting Actor' Academy Award for his portrayal of down-on-his-lucky Bela Lugosi marked the first time in Oscar history that a performer in any category won for playing an actual movie star . However , Bela Lugosi Jr.'s only objection to the film's portrayal of his father was his speech. In Lugosi's memory, his father never used foul language .

    This is the one Tim Burton ought to be remembered for. If this isn't an homage to Ed Wood, I don't know what it is. An optimistic telling of a pessimistic life. To put it in perspective, Ed Wood (1994) is like Edward Scissorhands (1990) minus the Dr. Seuss in terms of feels - attributable in large due to the Burton-Depp collaboration. The film itself doesn't have elements of non-realism, yet it is fantastical because it follows a quirky, lacking man's hopeful pursuits alongside his quirky, lacking friends, portrayed through fittingly quirky, contrastingly masterful cinematography. The plot is admittedly not riveting but interesting and heartening enough, but above all, Burton's execution of this unlikely film is what makes it "the one (he'll) be remembered for"... at least for me.

    i watched every Burton film so i think i know what i'm talking about when i say this gem is his finest work because unlike his other films there are no exaggerated over the top makeup and costumes and the characters although so weird feel so real and close to the audience, the cast is perfect portraying characters different from what they're used to especially the old brilliant actor playing bella lagusi, and johny Depp once again proves he's a winning horse, he held such an iconic, heavy, crazy but normal character and he convinced me he's Mr wood coming back to life, the depiction of Hollywood life and L.A at that time is perfectly done but the only draw back for me which didn't take away from the film is the white and black color i know it was important for the movie and maybe helped convince us but i didn't like it that much. finally i think this film really proves what a great authentic and smart director Tim Burton is

    The life and work of the legendary 'worst director of all time', Edward D. Wood Jr. Concentrating on the best-known period of his life in the 1950s, when he made Glen or Glenda (1953), Bride of the Monster (1955) and Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959). And focusing on both his transvestism and his touching friendship with the once great but now ageing and unemployed horror star Bela Lugosi.... Even thought he film is almost twenty years old, it's easily one of the finest and weirdest Bio-Pics ever made. Depp has never been better suited to a role, and proves here he is much more than Jack Sparrow, and it's a shame he will be best remembered for that awful series of movies. Of all the films that Burton and Depp have made together, this is the most daring and fun. Edward scissorhands is good, but the variety of characters were not there. Charlie and the Chocolate was fun too, but Depp was just channelling Marilyn Mansons inner child. It's ironic that a Black and White movie would have Burtons most colourful characters of his movies, and it's a movie that wants you to watch bad movies, very bad movies, that have to be seen to be believed. And when a film maker does that, you know the guy is in his prime. the support is amazing, and Jones, Murray and Landau are just amazing when on screen. But Depp is the heart and the soul of the movie, really putting his all in this. A great companion piece to watch with dark shadows...

    Now here is one of the great films about making....films. For those who don't know, Ed Wood is known to be not one of the, but the worst director of all time. This film celebrates his legacy with great love and respect. Tim Burton is one who, in my personal opinion has never made a truly great movie. That was until I saw Ed Wood. Speaking of Ed Wood his character is portrayed by Johnny Depp. Despite me claiming that Johnny Depp is an overrated actor, his performance in this film is so good, it almost made me respect Ed Wood as one of the greats. By that I mean that Depp shows how much this man loved his work that it almost makes you love his work too. One of my favorite lines is when Ed Wood is in a waiting room explaining to a lady, his future wife, about his profession in life....and he compares himself to the great Orson Welles. Now while this may seem ridiculous to most, just the way Depp explains this makes you think, Hey! Ya know, that really makes sense. That is because it is so true. Ed wood is the B version of Orson Welles....actually, make that the D version of Orson Welles. There is one line that truly sums up Ed Woods legacy. That line is towards the end of the film during the premiere of Plan 9 From Outer Space when Ed Wood says, "This is what I'll be remembered for."

    Ed Wood is often called one of the worst directors of all time, if not THE worst. His films suffered from laughably poor production quality, continuity errors and sub-par acting. Usually, we as the viewers, mock these flaws in films such as these but we rarely ever think about the work that was put into them or what the people behind them are like as individuals. In this film based on Ed Wood himself, follows the making of his three most infamous films, Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space and shows all the trials and troubles he had to go through to get these films made as well as his relationships with the actors, crew and in his personal life, most notably with famous horror star Bela Lugosi. Rather than make fun of Ed Wood or his work, the film instead portrays him as an ambitious young film maker who might be a little too ambitious for his own good. It's a more human look at him, almost on a personal level. Ed is played by Johnny Depp, who does a fantastic job as portraying him as both funny and sympathetic. You root for him all the way and feel his sadness and disappointment when things do not turn out as expected for him. Even though Depp acts well in the film, as do the other actors for that matter, the person who steals the show is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau plays the part to a tee and, much like Depp, plays him both funny and sympathetically only better in my opinion. The story alone is inspiring to anyone who is or was ever interested in doing something creative, especially film making. The final scene with Plan 9 playing in the theatre as Ed looks on, his face beaming with such happiness and mouthing the words he wrote and by the end he doesn't even seem to care what other people think about it but rather he is content with seeing his vision come alive. I should probably also mention that the film is not really entirely accurate to Ed Wood's real life but I feel if it was entirely accurate, the film wouldn't be as good. The only real flaw I can think of off the top of my head is that at the very end the film gives us a slide-show of all the characters and what has become of their real life counterparts and some of them are pretty sad to think about for such an uplifting movie, especially Ed himself, but that's very minor and the rest of the film is so good, I don't really mind. So, the next time you mock a film for not being up to your standards, think a little of the people behind it and the troubles they all went through to see it come to fruition. Then maybe, just a little, you can begin to appreciate film a whole lot more. I know I did after I saw Ed Wood.

    Despite the good play of Johnny Depp and even the better of the older actor, the film is quite slow. And on top - black and white. The story takes us to the early years of the last century in Hollywood. Young director looking for a way to break into show business using every opportunity to do it. Accidentally introduced to adult actor, former celebrity but current addict. (although nice image). After many difficulties which they experience together - several unsuccessful films, the separation of the young director with his girlfriend and finding new one, the young director manages to make a film about the lives of everyone around him and the process of filming movies. So he became director of the protagonist in the film. This movie shows how important it is to not give up on what you want to do, regardless of how old you are. The road is not all easy, but you always can find collaborators who will help you and who will believe in you. The movie hints the moment in which everyone has an oddity that must simply be accepted, because it makes him exactly the way he is. Ultimately all ranks well.

    Ed Wood, which is not totally a non-fiction film, is a wonderful portrayal of man who has multiple personalities, found it hard to get money, and is a guy who was voted "Worst Director of All Time." This film is often funny and amusing, but is not devoid of Tim Burton's trademark strangeness. This film captures the decade of the 1950's very well thanks to the use of black and white. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this film was produced back in the 1950's. Burton's film is about the director Ed Wood as he enters the most productive years of his life. Wood happens to be a man who is fond of wearing women's clothing and deeply idolizes Bela Lugosi, the star of the original Dracula film. Wood, with the help of Lugosi, goes on to make some monumental films. The acting is very good in the film. Even though Johnny Depp pairs up with Burton way too much, he delivers a surprisingly comical performance that seems straight from the heart. Martin Landau is brilliant as Bela and delivers one heck of a performance. There are some other great characters especially the humorous performances by Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones. Overall, this is a great film that works very well with the black and white coloring. This film has a heart and I loved the way it explains the relationship between Ed and Bela. This film has gotten me interested in Ed Wood, and I may have to check out his "bad" films to form my own opinions. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your typical Tim Burton film. I rate this film 9/10.

    I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp, and usually my favorite movies he does are collaborated with Tim Burton. I was hesitant to see this one because it looked like it would be boring, and I noticed that it was in black and white. I normally can't stand when movies made in a time when we have the technology for color are in black and white. This was the exception. This movie is honestly amazingly done. If you're hesitant to watch, don't be. It's very entertaining and exceptionally acted. I really shocked myself with how much i liked it. This is by far the best Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie I've seen (and I've seen them all). 10/10, I would absolutely recommend it.

This is a touching and comic tribute to a Hollywood maverick , a cross-dressing , angora-sweater wearing director, concentrating on the best-known period of his life in the 1950s, when lack of financing and repeated failures led to make a lot of bad films , in spite of Wood's optimism and vitality . And focusing his relationship with Bela Lugosi and his rare troupe of actors . This is a mostly true story of the legendary director of awful pictures and his strange group of friends and actors . This is a splendid tribute by Tim Burton to bring to the screen the tale of a filmmaker many consider to be the worst of all time . Lavishly produced , in fact , this film cost more to produce than all of Edward D. Wood Jr.'s films put together . Tim Burton said that he was drawn to the story because of the similarities between Edward D. Wood Jr.'s relationship with Bela Lugosi , now ageing and unemployed horror star , and his own friendship with Vincent Price late in the actor's life . Burton focuses on Ed's relationship with Bela , whose career is over by the time Wood befriends him . Depp is extraordinary and engaging as Ed , the strange filmmaker whose Angora sweaters were his weakness , women were his inspiration and movies were his passion . Johnny Depp has said that his characterization of Edward D. Wood Jr. was a mixture of "the blind optimism of Ronald Reagan, the enthusiasm of the Tin Man from The Wizard of OZ and Casey Kasem." . Martin Landau's winning of the 'Best Supporting Actor' Academy Award for his portrayal of down-on-his-lucky Bela Lugosi marked the first time in Oscar history that a performer in any category won for playing an actual movie star . However , Bela Lugosi Jr.'s only objection to the film's portrayal of his father was his speech. In Lugosi's memory, his father never used foul language . Sensational support cast , the secondary actors are mostly convincing and enjoyable , almost every role has an appropriate resemblance to his or her Z-player counterpart and the performances are adequate such as Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller , Jeffrey Jones as Criswell , Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge , Max Casella as Paul Marco , Brent Hinkley as Conrad Brooks , Lisa Marie as Vampira , George 'The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson and Juliet Landau as Loretta King .

    This is the one Tim Burton ought to be remembered for. If this isn't an homage to Ed Wood, I don't know what it is. An optimistic telling of a pessimistic life. To put it in perspective, Ed Wood (1994) is like Edward Scissorhands (1990) minus the Dr. Seuss in terms of feels - attributable in large due to the Burton-Depp collaboration. The film itself doesn't have elements of non-realism, yet it is fantastical because it follows a quirky, lacking man's hopeful pursuits alongside his quirky, lacking friends, portrayed through fittingly quirky, contrastingly masterful cinematography. The plot is admittedly not riveting but interesting and heartening enough, but above all, Burton's execution of this unlikely film is what makes it "the one (he'll) be remembered for"... at least for me.

Overall, this is a great film that works very well with the black and white coloring. This film has a heart and I loved the way it explains the relationship between Ed and Bela. This film has gotten me interested in Ed Wood, and I may have to check out his "bad" films to form my own opinions. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your typical Tim Burton film. I rate this film 9/10.

    I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp, and usually my favorite movies he does are collaborated with Tim Burton. I was hesitant to see this one because it looked like it would be boring, and I noticed that it was in black and white. I normally can't stand when movies made in a time when we have the technology for color are in black and white. This was the exception. This movie is honestly amazingly done. If you're hesitant to watch, don't be. It's very entertaining and exceptionally acted. I really shocked myself with how much i liked it. This is by far the best Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie I've seen (and I've seen them all). 10/10, I would absolutely recommend it.

    A biopic of the life and work of the legendary 'worst director of all time', 'Edward D. Wood Jr.' and who now occupies a lofty position as a cult icon ; being based on Rudolph Grey's book &uml;Nightmare of ecstasy : the life and art of Ed Wood&uml;. This is a touching and comic tribute to a Hollywood maverick , a cross-dressing , angora-sweater wearing director, concentrating on the best-known period of his life in the 1950s, when lack of financing and repeated failures led to make a lot of bad films , in spite of Wood's optimism and vitality . And focusing his relationship with Bela Lugosi and his rare troupe of actors . This is a mostly true story of the legendary director of awful pictures and his strange group of friends and actors . This is a splendid tribute by Tim Burton to bring to the screen the tale of a filmmaker many consider to be the worst of all time . Lavishly produced , in fact , this film cost more to produce than all of Edward D. Wood Jr.'s films put together . Tim Burton said that he was drawn to the story because of the similarities between Edward D. Wood Jr.'s relationship with Bela Lugosi , now ageing and unemployed horror star , and his own friendship with Vincent Price late in the actor's life . Burton focuses on Ed's relationship with Bela , whose career is over by the time Wood befriends him . Depp is extraordinary and engaging as Ed , the strange filmmaker whose Angora sweaters were his weakness , women were his inspiration and movies were his passion . Johnny Depp has said that his characterization of Edward D. Wood Jr. was a mixture of "the blind optimism of Ronald Reagan, the enthusiasm of the Tin Man from The Wizard of OZ and Casey Kasem." . Martin Landau's winning of the 'Best Supporting Actor' Academy Award for his portrayal of down-on-his-lucky Bela Lugosi marked the first time in Oscar history that a performer in any category won for playing an actual movie star . However , Bela Lugosi Jr.'s only objection to the film's portrayal of his father was his speech. In Lugosi's memory, his father never used foul language . Sensational support cast , the secondary actors are mostly convincing and enjoyable , almost every role has an appropriate resemblance to his or her Z-player counterpart and the performances are adequate such as Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller , Jeffrey Jones as Criswell , Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge , Max Casella as Paul Marco , Brent Hinkley as Conrad Brooks , Lisa Marie as Vampira , George 'The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson and Juliet Landau as Loretta King . Ed Wood was a low-budgeted auteur of such lousy actors and notoriously bad movies as &uml;Glen or Glenda&uml;, &uml;Bride of monster&uml; and &uml;Plan 9 from outer space&uml; . Agreeable musical score by Howard Shore , the sweeping music during the epilogue is based on the music from Glen or Glenda and being the first film by Tim Burton to not feature Danny Elfman's soundtrack . Evocative as well as luxurious cinematography in black and white by Stefan Czapsky . The motion picture was compelling and stunningly directed by Tim Burton .

    This is the one Tim Burton ought to be remembered for. If this isn't an homage to Ed Wood, I don't know what it is. An optimistic telling of a pessimistic life. To put it in perspective, Ed Wood (1994) is like Edward Scissorhands (1990) minus the Dr. Seuss in terms of feels - attributable in large due to the Burton-Depp collaboration. The film itself doesn't have elements of non-realism, yet it is fantastical because it follows a quirky, lacking man's hopeful pursuits alongside his quirky, lacking friends, portrayed through fittingly quirky, contrastingly masterful cinematography. The plot is admittedly not riveting but interesting and heartening enough, but above all, Burton's execution of this unlikely film is what makes it "the one (he'll) be remembered for"... at least for me.

    The life and work of the legendary 'worst director of all time', Edward D. Wood Jr. Concentrating on the best-known period of his life in the 1950s, when he made Glen or Glenda (1953), Bride of the Monster (1955) and Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959). And focusing on both his transvestism and his touching friendship with the once great but now ageing and unemployed horror star Bela Lugosi.... Even thought he film is almost twenty years old, it's easily one of the finest and weirdest Bio-Pics ever made. Depp has never been better suited to a role, and proves here he is much more than Jack Sparrow, and it's a shame he will be best remembered for that awful series of movies. Of all the films that Burton and Depp have made together, this is the most daring and fun. Edward scissorhands is good, but the variety of characters were not there. Charlie and the Chocolate was fun too, but Depp was just channelling Marilyn Mansons inner child. It's ironic that a Black and White movie would have Burtons most colourful characters of his movies, and it's a movie that wants you to watch bad movies, very bad movies, that have to be seen to be believed. And when a film maker does that, you know the guy is in his prime. the support is amazing, and Jones, Murray and Landau are just amazing when on screen. But Depp is the heart and the soul of the movie, really putting his all in this. A great companion piece to watch with dark shadows...

    Now here is one of the great films about making....films. For those who don't know, Ed Wood is known to be not one of the, but the worst director of all time. This film celebrates his legacy with great love and respect. Tim Burton is one who, in my personal opinion has never made a truly great movie. That was until I saw Ed Wood. Speaking of Ed Wood his character is portrayed by Johnny Depp. Despite me claiming that Johnny Depp is an overrated actor, his performance in this film is so good, it almost made me respect Ed Wood as one of the greats. By that I mean that Depp shows how much this man loved his work that it almost makes you love his work too. One of my favorite lines is when Ed Wood is in a waiting room explaining to a lady, his future wife, about his profession in life....and he compares himself to the great Orson Welles. Now while this may seem ridiculous to most, just the way Depp explains this makes you think, Hey! Ya know, that really makes sense. That is because it is so true. Ed wood is the B version of Orson Welles....actually, make that the D version of Orson Welles. There is one line that truly sums up Ed Woods legacy. That line is towards the end of the film during the premiere of Plan 9 From Outer Space when Ed Wood says, "This is what I'll be remembered for."

    Ed Wood is often called one of the worst directors of all time, if not THE worst. His films suffered from laughably poor production quality, continuity errors and sub-par acting. Usually, we as the viewers, mock these flaws in films such as these but we rarely ever think about the work that was put into them or what the people behind them are like as individuals. In this film based on Ed Wood himself, follows the making of his three most infamous films, Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space and shows all the trials and troubles he had to go through to get these films made as well as his relationships with the actors, crew and in his personal life, most notably with famous horror star Bela Lugosi. Rather than make fun of Ed Wood or his work, the film instead portrays him as an ambitious young film maker who might be a little too ambitious for his own good. It's a more human look at him, almost on a personal level. Ed is played by Johnny Depp, who does a fantastic job as portraying him as both funny and sympathetic. You root for him all the way and feel his sadness and disappointment when things do not turn out as expected for him. Even though Depp acts well in the film, as do the other actors for that matter, the person who steals the show is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau plays the part to a tee and, much like Depp, plays him both funny and sympathetically only better in my opinion. The story alone is inspiring to anyone who is or was ever interested in doing something creative, especially film making. The final scene with Plan 9 playing in the theatre as Ed looks on, his face beaming with such happiness and mouthing the words he wrote and by the end he doesn't even seem to care what other people think about it but rather he is content with seeing his vision come alive. I should probably also mention that the film is not really entirely accurate to Ed Wood's real life but I feel if it was entirely accurate, the film wouldn't be as good. The only real flaw I can think of off the top of my head is that at the very end the film gives us a slide-show of all the characters and what has become of their real life counterparts and some of them are pretty sad to think about for such an uplifting movie, especially Ed himself, but that's very minor and the rest of the film is so good, I don't really mind. So, the next time you mock a film for not being up to your standards, think a little of the people behind it and the troubles they all went through to see it come to fruition. Then maybe, just a little, you can begin to appreciate film a whole lot more. I know I did after I saw Ed Wood.

    Despite the good play of Johnny Depp and even the better of the older actor, the film is quite slow. And on top - black and white. The story takes us to the early years of the last century in Hollywood. Young director looking for a way to break into show business using every opportunity to do it. Accidentally introduced to adult actor, former celebrity but current addict. (although nice image). After many difficulties which they experience together - several unsuccessful films, the separation of the young director with his girlfriend and finding new one, the young director manages to make a film about the lives of everyone around him and the process of filming movies. So he became director of the protagonist in the film. This movie shows how important it is to not give up on what you want to do, regardless of how old you are. The road is not all easy, but you always can find collaborators who will help you and who will believe in you. The movie hints the moment in which everyone has an oddity that must simply be accepted, because it makes him exactly the way he is. Ultimately all ranks well.

    Ed Wood, which is not totally a non-fiction film, is a wonderful portrayal of man who has multiple personalities, found it hard to get money, and is a guy who was voted "Worst Director of All Time." This film is often funny and amusing, but is not devoid of Tim Burton's trademark strangeness. This film captures the decade of the 1950's very well thanks to the use of black and white. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this film was produced back in the 1950's. Burton's film is about the director Ed Wood as he enters the most productive years of his life. Wood happens to be a man who is fond of wearing women's clothing and deeply idolizes Bela Lugosi, the star of the original Dracula film. Wood, with the help of Lugosi, goes on to make some monumental films. The acting is very good in the film. Even though Johnny Depp pairs up with Burton way too much, he delivers a surprisingly comical performance that seems straight from the heart. Martin Landau is brilliant as Bela and delivers one heck of a performance. There are some other great characters especially the humorous performances by Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones. Overall, this is a great film that works very well with the black and white coloring. This film has a heart and I loved the way it explains the relationship between Ed and Bela. This film has gotten me interested in Ed Wood, and I may have to check out his "bad" films to form my own opinions. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your typical Tim Burton film. I rate this film 9/10.

    This is the one Tim Burton ought to be remembered for. If this isn't an homage to Ed Wood, I don't know what it is. An optimistic telling of a pessimistic life. To put it in perspective, Ed Wood (1994) is like Edward Scissorhands (1990) minus the Dr. Seuss in terms of feels - attributable in large due to the Burton-Depp collaboration. The film itself doesn't have elements of non-realism, yet it is fantastical because it follows a quirky, lacking man's hopeful pursuits alongside his quirky, lacking friends, portrayed through fittingly quirky, contrastingly masterful cinematography.

    Despite the good play of Johnny Depp and even the better of the older actor, the film is quite slow. And on top - black and white. The story takes us to the early years of the last century in Hollywood. Young director looking for a way to break into show business using every opportunity to do it. Accidentally introduced to adult actor, former celebrity but current addict. (although nice image). After many difficulties which they experience together - several unsuccessful films, the separation of the young director with his girlfriend and finding new one, the young director manages to make a film about the lives of everyone around him and the process of filming movies. So he became director of the protagonist in the film. This movie shows how important it is to not give up on what you want to do, regardless of how old you are. The road is not all easy, but you always can find collaborators who will help you and who will believe in you. The movie hints the moment in which everyone has an oddity that must simply be accepted, because it makes him exactly the way he is. Ultimately all ranks well.

    Ed Wood, which is not totally a non-fiction film, is a wonderful portrayal of man who has multiple personalities, found it hard to get money, and is a guy who was voted "Worst Director of All Time." This film is often funny and amusing, but is not devoid of Tim Burton's trademark strangeness. This film captures the decade of the 1950's very well thanks to the use of black and white. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this film was produced back in the 1950's. Burton's film is about the director Ed Wood as he enters the most productive years of his life. Wood happens to be a man who is fond of wearing women's clothing and deeply idolizes Bela Lugosi, the star of the original Dracula film. Wood, with the help of Lugosi, goes on to make some monumental films. The acting is very good in the film. Even though Johnny Depp pairs up with Burton way too much, he delivers a surprisingly comical performance that seems straight from the heart. Martin Landau is brilliant as Bela and delivers one heck of a performance. There are some other great characters especially the humorous performances by Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones. Overall, this is a great film that works very well with the black and white coloring. This film has a heart and I loved the way it explains the relationship between Ed and Bela. This film has gotten me interested in Ed Wood, and I may have to check out his "bad" films to form my own opinions. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your typical Tim Burton film. I rate this film 9/10.

    I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp, and usually my favorite movies he does are collaborated with Tim Burton. I was hesitant to see this one because it looked like it would be boring, and I noticed that it was in black and white. I normally can't stand when movies made in a time when we have the technology for color are in black and white. This was the exception. This movie is honestly amazingly done. If you're hesitant to watch, don't be. It's very entertaining and exceptionally acted. I really shocked myself with how much i liked it. This is by far the best Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie I've seen (and I've seen them all). 10/10, I would absolutely recommend it.

    A biopic of the life and work of the legendary 'worst director of all time', 'Edward D. Wood Jr.' and who now occupies a lofty position as a cult icon ; being based on Rudolph Grey's book &uml;Nightmare of ecstasy : the life and art of Ed Wood&uml;. This is a touching and comic tribute to a Hollywood maverick , a cross-dressing , angora-sweater wearing director, concentrating on the best-known period of his life in the 1950s, when lack of financing and repeated failures led to make a lot of bad films , in spite of Wood's optimism and vitality . And focusing his relationship with Bela Lugosi and his rare troupe of actors . This is a mostly true story of the legendary director of awful pictures and his strange group of friends and actors . This is a splendid tribute by Tim Burton to bring to the screen the tale of a filmmaker many consider to be the worst of all time . Lavishly produced , in fact , this film cost more to produce than all of Edward D. Wood Jr.'s films put together . Tim Burton said that he was drawn to the story because of the similarities between Edward D. Wood Jr.'s relationship with Bela Lugosi , now ageing and unemployed horror star , and his own friendship with Vincent Price late in the actor's life . Burton focuses on Ed's relationship with Bela , whose career is over by the time Wood befriends him . Depp is extraordinary and engaging as Ed , the strange filmmaker whose Angora sweaters were his weakness , women were his inspiration and movies were his passion . Johnny Depp has said that his characterization of Edward D. Wood Jr. was a mixture of "the blind optimism of Ronald Reagan, the enthusiasm of the Tin Man from The Wizard of OZ and Casey Kasem." . Martin Landau's winning of the 'Best Supporting Actor' Academy Award for his portrayal of down-on-his-lucky Bela Lugosi marked the first time in Oscar history that a performer in any category won for playing an actual movie star . However , Bela Lugosi Jr.'s only objection to the film's portrayal of his father was his speech. In Lugosi's memory, his father never used foul language . Sensational support cast , the secondary actors are mostly convincing and enjoyable , almost every role has an appropriate resemblance to his or her Z-player counterpart and the performances are adequate such as Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller , Jeffrey Jones as Criswell , Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge , Max Casella as Paul Marco , Brent Hinkley as Conrad Brooks , Lisa Marie as Vampira , George 'The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson and Juliet Landau as Loretta King . Ed Wood was a low-budgeted auteur of such lousy actors and notoriously bad movies as &uml;Glen or Glenda&uml;, &uml;Bride of monster&uml; and &uml;Plan 9 from outer space&uml; . Agreeable musical score by Howard Shore , the sweeping music during the epilogue is based on the music from Glen or Glenda and being the first film by Tim Burton to not feature Danny Elfman's soundtrack . Evocative as well as luxurious cinematography in black and white by Stefan Czapsky . The motion picture was compelling and stunningly directed by Tim Burton . Rating : Better than average , well worth seeing . Essential and indispensable watching .

    This is the one Tim Burton ought to be remembered for. If this isn't an homage to Ed Wood, I don't know what it is. An optimistic telling of a pessimistic life. To put it in perspective, Ed Wood (1994) is like Edward Scissorhands (1990) minus the Dr. Seuss in terms of feels - attributable in large due to the Burton-Depp collaboration. The film itself doesn't have elements of non-realism, yet it is fantastical because it follows a quirky, lacking man's hopeful pursuits alongside his quirky, lacking friends, portrayed through fittingly quirky, contrastingly masterful cinematography. The plot is admittedly not riveting but interesting and heartening enough, but above all, Burton's execution of this unlikely film is what makes it "the one (he'll) be remembered for"... at least for me.

And focusing on both his transvestism and his touching friendship with the once great but now ageing and unemployed horror star Bela Lugosi.... Even thought he film is almost twenty years old, it's easily one of the finest and weirdest Bio-Pics ever made. Depp has never been better suited to a role, and proves here he is much more than Jack Sparrow, and it's a shame he will be best remembered for that awful series of movies. Of all the films that Burton and Depp have made together, this is the most daring and fun. Edward scissorhands is good, but the variety of characters were not there. Charlie and the Chocolate was fun too, but Depp was just channelling Marilyn Mansons inner child. It's ironic that a Black and White movie would have Burtons most colourful characters of his movies, and it's a movie that wants you to watch bad movies, very bad movies, that have to be seen to be believed. And when a film maker does that, you know the guy is in his prime. the support is amazing, and Jones, Murray and Landau are just amazing when on screen. But Depp is the heart and the soul of the movie, really putting his all in this. A great companion piece to watch with dark shadows...

    Now here is one of the great films about making....films. For those who don't know, Ed Wood is known to be not one of the, but the worst director of all time. This film celebrates his legacy with great love and respect. Tim Burton is one who, in my personal opinion has never made a truly great movie. That was until I saw Ed Wood. Speaking of Ed Wood his character is portrayed by Johnny Depp. Despite me claiming that Johnny Depp is an overrated actor, his performance in this film is so good, it almost made me respect Ed Wood as one of the greats. By that I mean that Depp shows how much this man loved his work that it almost makes you love his work too. One of my favorite lines is when Ed Wood is in a waiting room explaining to a lady, his future wife, about his profession in life....and he compares himself to the great Orson Welles. Now while this may seem ridiculous to most, just the way Depp explains this makes you think, Hey! Ya know, that really makes sense. That is because it is so true. Ed wood is the B version of Orson Welles....actually, make that the D version of Orson Welles. There is one line that truly sums up Ed Woods legacy. That line is towards the end of the film during the premiere of Plan 9 From Outer Space when Ed Wood says, "This is what I'll be remembered for."

    Ed Wood is often called one of the worst directors of all time, if not THE worst. His films suffered from laughably poor production quality, continuity errors and sub-par acting. Usually, we as the viewers, mock these flaws in films such as these but we rarely ever think about the work that was put into them or what the people behind them are like as individuals. In this film based on Ed Wood himself, follows the making of his three most infamous films, Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space and shows all the trials and troubles he had to go through to get these films made as well as his relationships with the actors, crew and in his personal life, most notably with famous horror star Bela Lugosi. Rather than make fun of Ed Wood or his work, the film instead portrays him as an ambitious young film maker who might be a little too ambitious for his own good. It's a more human look at him, almost on a personal level. Ed is played by Johnny Depp, who does a fantastic job as portraying him as both funny and sympathetic. You root for him all the way and feel his sadness and disappointment when things do not turn out as expected for him. Even though Depp acts well in the film, as do the other actors for that matter, the person who steals the show is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau plays the part to a tee and, much like Depp, plays him both funny and sympathetically only better in my opinion. The story alone is inspiring to anyone who is or was ever interested in doing something creative, especially film making. The final scene with Plan 9 playing in the theatre as Ed looks on, his face beaming with such happiness and mouthing the words he wrote and by the end he doesn't even seem to care what other people think about it but rather he is content with seeing his vision come alive. I should probably also mention that the film is not really entirely accurate to Ed Wood's real life but I feel if it was entirely accurate, the film wouldn't be as good. The only real flaw I can think of off the top of my head is that at the very end the film gives us a slide-show of all the characters and what has become of their real life counterparts and some of them are pretty sad to think about for such an uplifting movie, especially Ed himself, but that's very minor and the rest of the film is so good, I don't really mind. So, the next time you mock a film for not being up to your standards, think a little of the people behind it and the troubles they all went through to see it come to fruition. Then maybe, just a little, you can begin to appreciate film a whole lot more. I know I did after I saw Ed Wood.

    Despite the good play of Johnny Depp and even the better of the older actor, the film is quite slow. And on top - black and white. The story takes us to the early years of the last century in Hollywood. Young director looking for a way to break into show business using every opportunity to do it. Accidentally introduced to adult actor, former celebrity but current addict. (although nice image). After many difficulties which they experience together - several unsuccessful films, the separation of the young director with his girlfriend and finding new one, the young director manages to make a film about the lives of everyone around him and the process of filming movies. So he became director of the protagonist in the film. This movie shows how important it is to not give up on what you want to do, regardless of how old you are. The road is not all easy, but you always can find collaborators who will help you and who will believe in you. The movie hints the moment in which everyone has an oddity that must simply be accepted, because it makes him exactly the way he is. Ultimately all ranks well.

This film is often funny and amusing, but is not devoid of Tim Burton's trademark strangeness. This film captures the decade of the 1950's very well thanks to the use of black and white.

    This is the one Tim Burton ought to be remembered for. If this isn't an homage to Ed Wood, I don't know what it is. An optimistic telling of a pessimistic life. To put it in perspective, Ed Wood (1994) is like Edward Scissorhands (1990) minus the Dr. Seuss in terms of feels - attributable in large due to the Burton-Depp collaboration. The film itself doesn't have elements of non-realism, yet it is fantastical because it follows a quirky, lacking man's hopeful pursuits alongside his quirky, lacking friends, portrayed through fittingly quirky, contrastingly masterful cinematography.

In this film based on Ed Wood himself, follows the making of his three most infamous films, Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space and shows all the trials and troubles he had to go through to get these films made as well as his relationships with the actors, crew and in his personal life, most notably with famous horror star Bela Lugosi. Rather than make fun of Ed Wood or his work, the film instead portrays him as an ambitious young film maker who might be a little too ambitious for his own good. It's a more human look at him, almost on a personal level. Ed is played by Johnny Depp, who does a fantastic job as portraying him as both funny and sympathetic. You root for him all the way and feel his sadness and disappointment when things do not turn out as expected for him. Even though Depp acts well in the film, as do the other actors for that matter, the person who steals the show is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau plays the part to a tee and, much like Depp, plays him both funny and sympathetically only better in my opinion. The story alone is inspiring to anyone who is or was ever interested in doing something creative, especially film making. The final scene with Plan 9 playing in the theatre as Ed looks on, his face beaming with such happiness and mouthing the words he wrote and by the end he doesn't even seem to care what other people think about it but rather he is content with seeing his vision come alive. I should probably also mention that the film is not really entirely accurate to Ed Wood's real life but I feel if it was entirely accurate, the film wouldn't be as good. The only real flaw I can think of off the top of my head is that at the very end the film gives us a slide-show of all the characters and what has become of their real life counterparts and some of them are pretty sad to think about for such an uplifting movie, especially Ed himself, but that's very minor and the rest of the film is so good, I don't really mind. So, the next time you mock a film for not being up to your standards, think a little of the people behind it and the troubles they all went through to see it come to fruition. Then maybe, just a little, you can begin to appreciate film a whole lot more. I know I did after I saw Ed Wood.

    Despite the good play of Johnny Depp and even the better of the older actor, the film is quite slow. And on top - black and white. The story takes us to the early years of the last century in Hollywood. Young director looking for a way to break into show business using every opportunity to do it. Accidentally introduced to adult actor, former celebrity but current addict. (although nice image). After many difficulties which they experience together - several unsuccessful films, the separation of the young director with his girlfriend and finding new one, the young director manages to make a film about the lives of everyone around him and the process of filming movies. So he became director of the protagonist in the film. This movie shows how important it is to not give up on what you want to do, regardless of how old you are. The road is not all easy, but you always can find collaborators who will help you and who will believe in you. The movie hints the moment in which everyone has an oddity that must simply be accepted, because it makes him exactly the way he is. Ultimately all ranks well.

    Ed Wood, which is not totally a non-fiction film, is a wonderful portrayal of man who has multiple personalities, found it hard to get money, and is a guy who was voted "Worst Director of All Time." This film is often funny and amusing, but is not devoid of Tim Burton's trademark strangeness. This film captures the decade of the 1950's very well thanks to the use of black and white. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this film was produced back in the 1950's. Burton's film is about the director Ed Wood as he enters the most productive years of his life. Wood happens to be a man who is fond of wearing women's clothing and deeply idolizes Bela Lugosi, the star of the original Dracula film. Wood, with the help of Lugosi, goes on to make some monumental films. The acting is very good in the film. Even though Johnny Depp pairs up with Burton way too much, he delivers a surprisingly comical performance that seems straight from the heart. Martin Landau is brilliant as Bela and delivers one heck of a performance. There are some other great characters especially the humorous performances by Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones. Overall, this is a great film that works very well with the black and white coloring. This film has a heart and I loved the way it explains the relationship between Ed and Bela. This film has gotten me interested in Ed Wood, and I may have to check out his "bad" films to form my own opinions. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your typical Tim Burton film. I rate this film 9/10.

    I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp, and usually my favorite movies he does are collaborated with Tim Burton. I was hesitant to see this one because it looked like it would be boring, and I noticed that it was in black and white. I normally can't stand when movies made in a time when we have the technology for color are in black and white. This was the exception. This movie is honestly amazingly done. If you're hesitant to watch, don't be. It's very entertaining and exceptionally acted. I really shocked myself with how much i liked it. This is by far the best Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie I've seen (and I've seen them all). 10/10, I would absolutely recommend it.

    A biopic of the life and work of the legendary 'worst director of all time', 'Edward D. Wood Jr.' and who now occupies a lofty position as a cult icon ; being based on Rudolph Grey's book &uml;Nightmare of ecstasy : the life and art of Ed Wood&uml;. This is a touching and comic tribute to a Hollywood maverick , a cross-dressing , angora-sweater wearing director, concentrating on the best-known period of his life in the 1950s, when lack of financing and repeated failures led to make a lot of bad films , in spite of Wood's optimism and vitality . And focusing his relationship with Bela Lugosi and his rare troupe of actors . This is a mostly true story of the legendary director of awful pictures and his strange group of friends and actors . This is a splendid tribute by Tim Burton to bring to the screen the tale of a filmmaker many consider to be the worst of all time . Lavishly produced , in fact , this film cost more to produce than all of Edward D. Wood Jr.'s films put together . Tim Burton said that he was drawn to the story because of the similarities between Edward D. Wood Jr.'s relationship with Bela Lugosi , now ageing and unemployed horror star , and his own friendship with Vincent Price late in the actor's life . Burton focuses on Ed's relationship with Bela , whose career is over by the time Wood befriends him . Depp is extraordinary and engaging as Ed , the strange filmmaker whose Angora sweaters were his weakness , women were his inspiration and movies were his passion . Johnny Depp has said that his characterization of Edward D. Wood Jr. was a mixture of "the blind optimism of Ronald Reagan, the enthusiasm of the Tin Man from The Wizard of OZ and Casey Kasem." . Martin Landau's winning of the 'Best Supporting Actor' Academy Award for his portrayal of down-on-his-lucky Bela Lugosi marked the first time in Oscar history that a performer in any category won for playing an actual movie star . However , Bela Lugosi Jr.'s only objection to the film's portrayal of his father was his speech. In Lugosi's memory, his father never used foul language . Sensational support cast , the secondary actors are mostly convincing and enjoyable , almost every role has an appropriate resemblance to his or her Z-player counterpart and the performances are adequate such as Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller , Jeffrey Jones as Criswell , Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge , Max Casella as Paul Marco , Brent Hinkley as Conrad Brooks , Lisa Marie as Vampira , George 'The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson and Juliet Landau as Loretta King . Ed Wood was a low-budgeted auteur of such lousy actors and notoriously bad movies as &uml;Glen or Glenda&uml;, &uml;Bride of monster&uml; and &uml;Plan 9 from outer space&uml; . Agreeable musical score by Howard Shore , the sweeping music during the epilogue is based on the music from Glen or Glenda and being the first film by Tim Burton to not feature Danny Elfman's soundtrack . Evocative as well as luxurious cinematography in black and white by Stefan Czapsky . The motion picture was compelling and stunningly directed by Tim Burton . Rating : Better than average , well worth seeing . Essential and indispensable watching .

    This is the one Tim Burton ought to be remembered for. If this isn't an homage to Ed Wood, I don't know what it is. An optimistic telling of a pessimistic life. To put it in perspective, Ed Wood (1994) is like Edward Scissorhands (1990) minus the Dr. Seuss in terms of feels - attributable in large due to the Burton-Depp collaboration. The film itself doesn't have elements of non-realism, yet it is fantastical because it follows a quirky, lacking man's hopeful pursuits alongside his quirky, lacking friends, portrayed through fittingly quirky, contrastingly masterful cinematography. The plot is admittedly not riveting but interesting and heartening enough, but above all, Burton's execution of this unlikely film is what makes it "the one (he'll) be remembered for"... at least for me.

    i watched every Burton film so i think i know what i'm talking about when i say this gem is his finest work because unlike his other films there are no exaggerated over the top makeup and costumes and the characters although so weird feel so real and close to the audience, the cast is perfect portraying characters different from what they're used to especially the old brilliant actor playing bella lagusi, and johny Depp once again proves he's a winning horse, he held such an iconic, heavy, crazy but normal character and he convinced me he's Mr wood coming back to life, the depiction of Hollywood life and L.A at that time is perfectly done but the only draw back for me which didn't take away from the film is the white and black color i know it was important for the movie and maybe helped convince us but i didn't like it that much. finally i think this film really proves what a great authentic and smart director Tim Burton is

    The life and work of the legendary 'worst director of all time', Edward D. Wood Jr. Concentrating on the best-known period of his life in the 1950s, when he made Glen or Glenda (1953), Bride of the Monster (1955) and Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959). And focusing on both his transvestism and his touching friendship with the once great but now ageing and unemployed horror star Bela Lugosi.... Even thought he film is almost twenty years old, it's easily one of the finest and weirdest Bio-Pics ever made. Depp has never been better suited to a role, and proves here he is much more than Jack Sparrow, and it's a shame he will be best remembered for that awful series of movies. Of all the films that Burton and Depp have made together, this is the most daring and fun. Edward scissorhands is good, but the variety of characters were not there. Charlie and the Chocolate was fun too, but Depp was just channelling Marilyn Mansons inner child. It's ironic that a Black and White movie would have Burtons most colourful characters of his movies, and it's a movie that wants you to watch bad movies, very bad movies, that have to be seen to be believed. And when a film maker does that, you know the guy is in his prime. the support is amazing, and Jones, Murray and Landau are just amazing when on screen. But Depp is the heart and the soul of the movie, really putting his all in this. A great companion piece to watch with dark shadows...
