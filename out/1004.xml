    Wes Studi, so hateful in LAST OF THE MOHICANS, is about as sympathetic a character as you can get in GERONIMO, and Walter Hill's direction is about as tight as it gets (which is saying a lot for a director of Hill's caliber). The cinematography, if nothing else, should've won some kind of award. One thing I would've liked to have seen in a movie like this is the root cause of The American Indian Wars. According to Robert M. Utley, it all began when Indians were being starved by buffalo hunters out for furs, who decimated the great herds, leaving the meat to rot and the Natives to starve. At a meeting called between the townsfolk and the Indians, one townie reportedly said: "If they're hungry, let 'em eat grass." When the smoke cleared, the townie was found dead, with his mouth stuffed full of grass. A LOT of mythinformation came out of the genocide that followed. General Custer, a Civil War vet, was nicknamed "The Son of the Morning Star" because he liked to attack unguarded Indian villages at sunup. His preferred method was to wait for the braves to go off to hunt, leaving the women, children, and elderly alone and unarmed. Sherman, another vet who put the South to the torch, coined a popular phrase when he said that "the only GOOD Indian is a DEAD Indian." U.$. Army soldiers, foreshadowing the likes of the Nazis and Ed Gein, made purses from the genitalia of murdered Indian women (it's out there; look it up). GERONIMO is and isn't historically accurate; what it most definitely IS is a great movie.

    Geronimo: An American Legend is directed by Walter Hill and written by John Milius. It stars Wes Studi, Jason Patric, Robert Duvall, Gene Hackman, Matt Damon and Pato Hoffman. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern. Story tells of what led Geronimo to being the most wanted Apache warrior on the American Government list, and his subsequent capture/surrender in 1886. Walter Hill takes his Westerns seriously, striving for authenticity in look, feel and narrative. He achieves all of these in Geronimo, only that this is hardly a biography of Geronimo the man. Film chronicles the great Apache leader courtesy of the memoirs of one of the cavalrymen who hunted him down, this thread is surrounded by historical points of worth such as land rights, the changing of the West, cultural clashes, racism and etc. Add in some lush Utah photography, traditional Western staples such as horseback chases, fights and shootouts, and it's just under two hours of good Western movie entertainment. But the screenplay doesn't open up Geronimo the man, in fact not really affording the excellent Studi (Geronimo) all that much screen time in the process. Film would have been better titled as Geronimo, Charles B. Gatewood (Patric) and Britton Davis (Damon), since the latter two are dealt with as much as the Apache warrior is. It's a good film that only deals in under two years of the Geronimo Campaign. Yes it redresses the balance by attempting to show both sides of the coin, and for sure it isn't found wanting for accuracy. But under developing the title character is a major problem. This should have been much much better and leaves us still waiting for a definitive Geronimo story. 6/10

    Walter Hill's biopic of the Apache hero brings to life the political struggle between Native Americans and the US army in the 19th century. It's a fast paced, well made movie that's more educational than everything else; as a viewer to whom the story was completely new, I enjoyed learning about the tensions and situations along with the historical backdrop. However, I can't help but feel the film is lacking something: it has a made for TV feel and never has the 'bite' or heart that make other biopics so affecting. This one goes through the motions and utilises a powerful cast to bring the characters to life, but you watch it in the same way you watch a history documentary: to learn rather than feel. The blame has to go to John Milius's script, I think. Still, both Hackman and Duvall contribute seasoned turns as grizzled old war veterans, and it's great to see a fresh-faced Matt Damon taking on a leading role and handling it comfortably so early on in his career. What a surprise, too, to discover that Jason Patric (THE LOST BOYS) could actually act back in the day. The best cast member is Wes Studi as Geronimo himself: playing his character stony-faced most of the time, he gets the man's humility, strength and sense of quiet honour just right.

    first let me say the this is a graphic movie lots of shootouts and bloody wounds its rated pg-13 for frontier violence witch i think it should have been rated R for frontier violence.the acting was wonderful by Gene Hackman and Wes Studi, now Jason Patric was mostly bull and boring.for people looking for a accurate history movie this isn't for you but if you like a good western drama like Dancing With Wolves this is for you. now Geronimo is in no way better than The Last Of The Mohicans or Dancing With Wolves but this is a good movie to relax, kick up your feet and lay on the couch for 2 hours with family member or friend and enjoy the movie about the legend of Geronimo

    "I don't feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them. There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves."  John Wayne (interview) "Two thousand years of history, could not be wiped away so easily."  Bob Marley "The Indians must conform to "the white man's ways," peaceably if they will, forcibly if they must. They must adjust themselves to their environment, and conform their mode of living substantially to our civilization. This civilization may not be the best possible, but it is the best the Indians can get. They cannot escape it, and must either conform to it or be crushed by it. The tribal relations should be broken up, socialism destroyed, and the family and the autonomy of the individual substituted." - Commissioner Thomas Morgan After demonizing Native American Indians for several decades, Hollywood suddenly began releasing a slew of revisionist westerns in the late 60s and early 70s. Enter films like "Buffalo Bill", "Ulzana's Raid", "A Man Called Horse" and "Soldier Blue", all of which forced their audiences to empathise with subjugated natives whilst portraying the "white man" as genocidal brutes bent on conquest. Even John Ford, one-time king of racist caricatures, tried to make amends with "Cheyenne Autumn", his apology for past pictures. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, French, Italian and British film-makers were treading similar ground. With the dismantling of the British Empire, British directors began releasing a spread of anti Colonial war films, whilst European directors like Gavras, Wertmuller and Pontecorvo protested the treatment of Algerians and the aggressions of the French Empire. With the battle for history won, films in the early 90s then began to treat this subject in a much more elegiac fashion. Films like "Dances With Wolves", "Thunderheart, "Squanto", "Geronimo" and "The Last of the Mohicans" serve up romantic myths, treating Native Americans with a mixture of reverence, nostalgia and melancholy. Released at the end of this wave, Walter Hill's "Geronimo" focuses on the "Geronimo Campaign", a period of history between 1885 and 1886 in which five thousand US cavalry men attempted to hunt and kill a group of Apache Indians. As is typical of these films, the US Cavalry is portrayed as an aggressive invader whilst the Indians are treated as a band of unfairly persecuted freedom fighters. With the Apaches placed in reservations (ie, concentration camps), caged in trains like Holocaust victims and betrayed by fellow Indians seduced by the false promises of white men, the film is implicitly critical of a certain brand of Colonialism. It's all familiar stuff, very superficially drawn, but the film nevertheless differentiates itself from revisionist westerns in several ways. It revokes the clich&eacute; of having an enlightened white man shedding his white ways and fighting for the red skins, and instead adopts a tone of total futility. Here, the battle is already lost, the natives already defeated, and our white hero has long resigned to the horrors of his own actions. Thus, rather than having a white man joining forces with the natives and taking up arms with them against the invaders - your typical "Avatar" narrative - we have a white man attempting to reason with natives such that they accept their own loss. Such that they come to terms with their defeat and stop wasting the lives of their few remaining tribesmen in a futile fight against a technologically and numerically superior foe. Because of this stance, the film plays less like a drama or action fantasy, than a kind of detached tragedy. The weight of a hundred years of history has already determined the outcome of the film, the typical Hollywood fantasies (the flights of fancy where audiences woop with joy as the Indians rebel) rejected entirely. The battle is over. Victory is impossible. History is defeat. This may make for less satisfying viewing, but it gets under your skin. Another bold choice is the resignation of the white officer at the end of the film. Whilst most films in this genre actualise the white man's rage by having him join forces with the enemy and fight against his homeland, the truth is, "doing nothing" is often a much braver act. Violence is not necessarily action. Social structures are run by action, and, contrary to popular opinion, it is violence that makes sure things stay the way they are. Sometimes the truly violent act is to do nothing, a radical refusal often undermining the status quo. Sometimes the only authentic stance to take in dark times is to do nothing, to refuse all commitment (see Renoir's "The Devil Probably"). 7.9/10 - Though directed by Walter Hill, screenwriter John Milius is the real auteur of this picture. Milius' lug-headed politics and passions ooze from every scene, whilst director Walter Hill is simply content to use the tale as an excuse to indulge in his love for his mentors, Peckinpah and Siegel. The film is perhaps better than "Dances With Wolves", but loses points for some middlebrow sermonising. And though critical of US Calvary men and policy makers, the film is nevertheless heavily whitewashed, too fearful to deal with some of the darker truths which occurred during the era. See "Europa Europa".

    Some say that Geronimo: An American Legend is revisionist but there is no getting away from the fact that this movie is poorly made hokum. The story begins and firmly stays with the point of view of the white man. One of the first scenes sets the tone for the following nonsense by having the American Cavalry officer played by Gene Hackman stress to his men the desire to allow the Indian women and children to escape to safety before they ride in to capture the renegade Indians. This cynical attempt at stressing the concern or at least the benevolence of the American Cavalry is ridiculous considering the well documented indiscriminate slaughter of Indian women and children perpetrated by American forces in the west. This travesty continues with Charles B. Gatewood played with angelic wetness by Jason Patric espousing an extraordinary and relentless knowledge of Apache customs, beliefs and spirituality to the young impressionable Lt. Britton Davis (Matt Damon). Ignorance and a want to stay ignorant of the Indian and their beliefs was standard for US soldiers and civilians alike at the time. The image of the Red Indian as created by Hollywood is perpetuated in this production without any attempt to shed new light on the subject. The revisionist Hollywood clich&eacute; is that the American Forces accidentally start the carnage and slaughter because of some simple misunderstanding. That the brutality is somehow impelled because of some small yet legitimate action by the Indian. Flying in the face of documented history, the general impression created by Hollywood is that the wholesale murder of the Red Indian was all a terrible mistake. The fact that Geronimo was never made a Chief because he was too impetuous and irresponsible is not broached. He is seen talking as if a Chief with retrained wisdom and thought. Many of Geromimo's own tribe found him to be dangerous and unreliable. Some still to this day wonder why Geronimo has become such an icon for white America. On a technical level this production is shot like a TV movie and the editing is especially bad. The dialogue is atrocious and unoriginal, an example being when Geronimo shoots a jug out of the hand of a Marshall at distance "That was a good shot!"......."No, I was aiming for his head!"

    This is a beautifully filmed and clearly told movie. The politically correct aspect about the injustices towards the Native population wasn't rammed down your throat. It was just matter of factly shown with greater impact. A little more of Geronimo's life prior to the start of the incidents in this movie could have been shown. Matt Damon is good as the idealistic young officer. Jason Patric is quite convincing too. There aren't too many annoying and one dimensionally good or evil characters like in some of the other recent movies of this genre. Do watch it if you can.

    Walter Hill is a true, seasoned action deliverer. Just look at his stellar films and this is why his one of my favourite directors. Still need to see his highly regarded western "The Long Riders" though. Nevertheless his take on the American legend "Geronimo" was not what I was expecting. It's quite a tone down piece (but not on the drama front), still his professional handling of the bravado action contains that walloping punch we have come to expect (like the sequence in a Mexican bar), but the thoughtfully mediative (if a tad stuffy and not entirely correct) material (by John Milius) and productively detailed characters are what takes centre stage. The outstanding performances led by a cast of Gene Hackman, Robert Duvall, Jason Patric, Wes Studi, Matt Damon, Rodney A. Grant and Kevin Tighe really do cement the humane edge of brave men with moralistic stances. Patric is a revelation in his role, bringing the right idealistic balance and so is a pre-stardom Damon. Duvall brings a solidly noble complexity and Hackman aims up with one of his respectably collected turns. Studi is picture-perfect as Geronimo, who embraces the legend and crafts out a mythical mark. Hill mechanically stages it with a certain ruggedness that's never lost amongst its fetching tailoring, as he does a presentable job covering the sprawling Arizona and Utah foregrounds in getting every little detail of the terrain into the shot. While not flashy, the imagery does linger (as well as some explosive and bloody confrontations) and the scenic cinematography is earthly projected for a genuine look and feel. Ry Cooder (a prolific contributor for Hill) orchestrates a poignantly majestic and spiritually mannered score that enhances its epic framework. A favourably gripping western.

    Despite the creative presence of Walter Hill and John Milius behind it, the movie gets a lot of things wrong. Matt Damon's grating voice-over is handled with little care and is nothing more than the grappling hook that drags the movie from one episode to the next as though we're reading an encyclopedic entry rather than watching a fully fleshed movie. The point-of-view is never allowed to remain within one side or group of characters long enough for them to come alive as anything than cutouts from a history page. We don't stay long enough to learn the actual problems that plagued the Chiricahua (and other Apache bands) in the San Carlos and White River reservations and we don't stay long enough with General Crook and his cavalry to begin to understand the tightrope the sympathetic General (who no less came to the Southwest after slaughtering Cheyennes in the North) has to walk in trying to appease an anxious government in the East while doing his best to save what remains of the Apaches from the encroachment of white settlers into their lands. As a piece of history the movie is naturally inadequate because the Indian affairs in the Southwest were more complex than a movie can afford to depict. As a gritty western action movie (the kind which Walter Hill is the expert) it's too sprawling and incoherent to ever get enough steam. We get the occasional slow-motion gunfight and a pretty good saloon standoff but they're not enough to save the movie from rumbling mediocrity.

    Regardless of the absolute historical veracity of the film, GERONIMO:AN American LEGEND is, first and foremost, an engaging piece of motion picture entertainment. Written by John Milius, and directed by Walter Hill (with a dynamite soundtrack by Ry Cooder), the film attempts an evenhanded examination of the final chapters in America's war-torn and bloody relationship with The Apache Nation. Most historians would agree that the government of the United States enacted legislative policies concerning the Apache which were less than honest, and led to senseless acts of mayhem and violence. America's inept handling of these Native Americans attests to the sad fact that spurious 'short-term fixes' very often can lead to onerous and unintended diplomatic protocol. Neither the US or the Indians could claim the moral or ethical high ground, because such a position did not exist. Both sides were guilty of genocidal madness. At least this film attempts to present the issues and shed some light on the reasons that led to this decades long, violent and ill fated conflict. Jason Patric, as 1st Lt. Charles B. Gatewood, and Wes Studi, as Geronimo, convincingly embody the conflicting aims and strategies of the United States Government and the Apache Nation. Each man is portrayed as an honorable individual who tries to find common ground in an impossible situation where neither man has complete control. The film is a deft balancing act between an action adventure motion picture, and a thoughtful meditation on an almost insoluble clash between two cultures. THREE AND A HALF STARS.

Because of this stance, the film plays less like a drama or action fantasy, than a kind of detached tragedy. The weight of a hundred years of history has already determined the outcome of the film, the typical Hollywood fantasies (the flights of fancy where audiences woop with joy as the Indians rebel) rejected entirely. The battle is over. Victory is impossible. History is defeat. This may make for less satisfying viewing, but it gets under your skin. Another bold choice is the resignation of the white officer at the end of the film. Whilst most films in this genre actualise the white man's rage by having him join forces with the enemy and fight against his homeland, the truth is, "doing nothing" is often a much braver act. Violence is not necessarily action. Social structures are run by action, and, contrary to popular opinion, it is violence that makes sure things stay the way they are. Sometimes the truly violent act is to do nothing, a radical refusal often undermining the status quo. Sometimes the only authentic stance to take in dark times is to do nothing, to refuse all commitment (see Renoir's "The Devil Probably"). 7.9/10 - Though directed by Walter Hill, screenwriter John Milius is the real auteur of this picture. Milius' lug-headed politics and passions ooze from every scene, whilst director Walter Hill is simply content to use the tale as an excuse to indulge in his love for his mentors, Peckinpah and Siegel. The film is perhaps better than "Dances With Wolves", but loses points for some middlebrow sermonising. And though critical of US Calvary men and policy makers, the film is nevertheless heavily whitewashed, too fearful to deal with some of the darker truths which occurred during the era. See "Europa Europa".

    Some say that Geronimo: An American Legend is revisionist but there is no getting away from the fact that this movie is poorly made hokum. The story begins and firmly stays with the point of view of the white man. One of the first scenes sets the tone for the following nonsense by having the American Cavalry officer played by Gene Hackman stress to his men the desire to allow the Indian women and children to escape to safety before they ride in to capture the renegade Indians. This cynical attempt at stressing the concern or at least the benevolence of the American Cavalry is ridiculous considering the well documented indiscriminate slaughter of Indian women and children perpetrated by American forces in the west. This travesty continues with Charles B. Gatewood played with angelic wetness by Jason Patric espousing an extraordinary and relentless knowledge of Apache customs, beliefs and spirituality to the young impressionable Lt. Britton Davis (Matt Damon). Ignorance and a want to stay ignorant of the Indian and their beliefs was standard for US soldiers and civilians alike at the time. The image of the Red Indian as created by Hollywood is perpetuated in this production without any attempt to shed new light on the subject. The revisionist Hollywood clich&eacute; is that the American Forces accidentally start the carnage and slaughter because of some simple misunderstanding. That the brutality is somehow impelled because of some small yet legitimate action by the Indian. Flying in the face of documented history, the general impression created by Hollywood is that the wholesale murder of the Red Indian was all a terrible mistake. The fact that Geronimo was never made a Chief because he was too impetuous and irresponsible is not broached. He is seen talking as if a Chief with retrained wisdom and thought. Many of Geromimo's own tribe found him to be dangerous and unreliable. Some still to this day wonder why Geronimo has become such an icon for white America. On a technical level this production is shot like a TV movie and the editing is especially bad. The dialogue is atrocious and unoriginal, an example being when Geronimo shoots a jug out of the hand of a Marshall at distance "That was a good shot!"......."No, I was aiming for his head!"

    This is a beautifully filmed and clearly told movie. The politically correct aspect about the injustices towards the Native population wasn't rammed down your throat. It was just matter of factly shown with greater impact. A little more of Geronimo's life prior to the start of the incidents in this movie could have been shown. Matt Damon is good as the idealistic young officer. Jason Patric is quite convincing too. There aren't too many annoying and one dimensionally good or evil characters like in some of the other recent movies of this genre. Do watch it if you can.

    Walter Hill is a true, seasoned action deliverer. Just look at his stellar films and this is why his one of my favourite directors. Still need to see his highly regarded western "The Long Riders" though. Nevertheless his take on the American legend "Geronimo" was not what I was expecting. It's quite a tone down piece (but not on the drama front), still his professional handling of the bravado action contains that walloping punch we have come to expect (like the sequence in a Mexican bar), but the thoughtfully mediative (if a tad stuffy and not entirely correct) material (by John Milius) and productively detailed characters are what takes centre stage. The outstanding performances led by a cast of Gene Hackman, Robert Duvall, Jason Patric, Wes Studi, Matt Damon, Rodney A. Grant and Kevin Tighe really do cement the humane edge of brave men with moralistic stances. Patric is a revelation in his role, bringing the right idealistic balance and so is a pre-stardom Damon. Duvall brings a solidly noble complexity and Hackman aims up with one of his respectably collected turns. Studi is picture-perfect as Geronimo, who embraces the legend and crafts out a mythical mark. Hill mechanically stages it with a certain ruggedness that's never lost amongst its fetching tailoring, as he does a presentable job covering the sprawling Arizona and Utah foregrounds in getting every little detail of the terrain into the shot. While not flashy, the imagery does linger (as well as some explosive and bloody confrontations) and the scenic cinematography is earthly projected for a genuine look and feel. Ry Cooder (a prolific contributor for Hill) orchestrates a poignantly majestic and spiritually mannered score that enhances its epic framework. A favourably gripping western.

    Despite the creative presence of Walter Hill and John Milius behind it, the movie gets a lot of things wrong. Matt Damon's grating voice-over is handled with little care and is nothing more than the grappling hook that drags the movie from one episode to the next as though we're reading an encyclopedic entry rather than watching a fully fleshed movie. The point-of-view is never allowed to remain within one side or group of characters long enough for them to come alive as anything than cutouts from a history page. We don't stay long enough to learn the actual problems that plagued the Chiricahua (and other Apache bands) in the San Carlos and White River reservations and we don't stay long enough with General Crook and his cavalry to begin to understand the tightrope the sympathetic General (who no less came to the Southwest after slaughtering Cheyennes in the North) has to walk in trying to appease an anxious government in the East while doing his best to save what remains of the Apaches from the encroachment of white settlers into their lands. As a piece of history the movie is naturally inadequate because the Indian affairs in the Southwest were more complex than a movie can afford to depict. As a gritty western action movie (the kind which Walter Hill is the expert) it's too sprawling and incoherent to ever get enough steam. We get the occasional slow-motion gunfight and a pretty good saloon standoff but they're not enough to save the movie from rumbling mediocrity.

    Regardless of the absolute historical veracity of the film, GERONIMO:AN American LEGEND is, first and foremost, an engaging piece of motion picture entertainment. Written by John Milius, and directed by Walter Hill (with a dynamite soundtrack by Ry Cooder), the film attempts an evenhanded examination of the final chapters in America's war-torn and bloody relationship with The Apache Nation. Most historians would agree that the government of the United States enacted legislative policies concerning the Apache which were less than honest, and led to senseless acts of mayhem and violence. America's inept handling of these Native Americans attests to the sad fact that spurious 'short-term fixes' very often can lead to onerous and unintended diplomatic protocol. Neither the US or the Indians could claim the moral or ethical high ground, because such a position did not exist. Both sides were guilty of genocidal madness. At least this film attempts to present the issues and shed some light on the reasons that led to this decades long, violent and ill fated conflict. Jason Patric, as 1st Lt. Charles B. Gatewood, and Wes Studi, as Geronimo, convincingly embody the conflicting aims and strategies of the United States Government and the Apache Nation. Each man is portrayed as an honorable individual who tries to find common ground in an impossible situation where neither man has complete control. The film is a deft balancing act between an action adventure motion picture, and a thoughtful meditation on an almost insoluble clash between two cultures. THREE AND A HALF STARS.

    Wes Studi, so hateful in LAST OF THE MOHICANS, is about as sympathetic a character as you can get in GERONIMO, and Walter Hill's direction is about as tight as it gets (which is saying a lot for a director of Hill's caliber). The cinematography, if nothing else, should've won some kind of award. One thing I would've liked to have seen in a movie like this is the root cause of The American Indian Wars. According to Robert M. Utley, it all began when Indians were being starved by buffalo hunters out for furs, who decimated the great herds, leaving the meat to rot and the Natives to starve. At a meeting called between the townsfolk and the Indians, one townie reportedly said: "If they're hungry, let 'em eat grass." When the smoke cleared, the townie was found dead, with his mouth stuffed full of grass. A LOT of mythinformation came out of the genocide that followed. General Custer, a Civil War vet, was nicknamed "The Son of the Morning Star" because he liked to attack unguarded Indian villages at sunup. His preferred method was to wait for the braves to go off to hunt, leaving the women, children, and elderly alone and unarmed. Sherman, another vet who put the South to the torch, coined a popular phrase when he said that "the only GOOD Indian is a DEAD Indian." U.$. Army soldiers, foreshadowing the likes of the Nazis and Ed Gein, made purses from the genitalia of murdered Indian women (it's out there; look it up). GERONIMO is and isn't historically accurate; what it most definitely IS is a great movie.

    Geronimo: An American Legend is directed by Walter Hill and written by John Milius. It stars Wes Studi, Jason Patric, Robert Duvall, Gene Hackman, Matt Damon and Pato Hoffman. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern. Story tells of what led Geronimo to being the most wanted Apache warrior on the American Government list, and his subsequent capture/surrender in 1886. Walter Hill takes his Westerns seriously, striving for authenticity in look, feel and narrative. He achieves all of these in Geronimo, only that this is hardly a biography of Geronimo the man. Film chronicles the great Apache leader courtesy of the memoirs of one of the cavalrymen who hunted him down, this thread is surrounded by historical points of worth such as land rights, the changing of the West, cultural clashes, racism and etc. Add in some lush Utah photography, traditional Western staples such as horseback chases, fights and shootouts, and it's just under two hours of good Western movie entertainment. But the screenplay doesn't open up Geronimo the man, in fact not really affording the excellent Studi (Geronimo) all that much screen time in the process. Film would have been better titled as Geronimo, Charles B. Gatewood (Patric) and Britton Davis (Damon), since the latter two are dealt with as much as the Apache warrior is. It's a good film that only deals in under two years of the Geronimo Campaign. Yes it redresses the balance by attempting to show both sides of the coin, and for sure it isn't found wanting for accuracy. But under developing the title character is a major problem. This should have been much much better and leaves us still waiting for a definitive Geronimo story. 6/10

    Walter Hill's biopic of the Apache hero brings to life the political struggle between Native Americans and the US army in the 19th century. It's a fast paced, well made movie that's more educational than everything else; as a viewer to whom the story was completely new, I enjoyed learning about the tensions and situations along with the historical backdrop. However, I can't help but feel the film is lacking something: it has a made for TV feel and never has the 'bite' or heart that make other biopics so affecting. This one goes through the motions and utilises a powerful cast to bring the characters to life, but you watch it in the same way you watch a history documentary: to learn rather than feel. The blame has to go to John Milius's script, I think. Still, both Hackman and Duvall contribute seasoned turns as grizzled old war veterans, and it's great to see a fresh-faced Matt Damon taking on a leading role and handling it comfortably so early on in his career. What a surprise, too, to discover that Jason Patric (THE LOST BOYS) could actually act back in the day. The best cast member is Wes Studi as Geronimo himself: playing his character stony-faced most of the time, he gets the man's humility, strength and sense of quiet honour just right.

    first let me say the this is a graphic movie lots of shootouts and bloody wounds its rated pg-13 for frontier violence witch i think it should have been rated R for frontier violence.the acting was wonderful by Gene Hackman and Wes Studi, now Jason Patric was mostly bull and boring.for people looking for a accurate history movie this isn't for you but if you like a good western drama like Dancing With Wolves this is for you. now Geronimo is in no way better than The Last Of The Mohicans or Dancing With Wolves but this is a good movie to relax, kick up your feet and lay on the couch for 2 hours with family member or friend and enjoy the movie about the legend of Geronimo

    "I don't feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them. There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves."  John Wayne (interview) "Two thousand years of history, could not be wiped away so easily."  Bob Marley "The Indians must conform to "the white man's ways," peaceably if they will, forcibly if they must. They must adjust themselves to their environment, and conform their mode of living substantially to our civilization. This civilization may not be the best possible, but it is the best the Indians can get. They cannot escape it, and must either conform to it or be crushed by it. The tribal relations should be broken up, socialism destroyed, and the family and the autonomy of the individual substituted." - Commissioner Thomas Morgan After demonizing Native American Indians for several decades, Hollywood suddenly began releasing a slew of revisionist westerns in the late 60s and early 70s. Enter films like "Buffalo Bill", "Ulzana's Raid", "A Man Called Horse" and "Soldier Blue", all of which forced their audiences to empathise with subjugated natives whilst portraying the "white man" as genocidal brutes bent on conquest. Even John Ford, one-time king of racist caricatures, tried to make amends with "Cheyenne Autumn", his apology for past pictures. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, French, Italian and British film-makers were treading similar ground. With the dismantling of the British Empire, British directors began releasing a spread of anti Colonial war films, whilst European directors like Gavras, Wertmuller and Pontecorvo protested the treatment of Algerians and the aggressions of the French Empire. With the battle for history won, films in the early 90s then began to treat this subject in a much more elegiac fashion. Films like "Dances With Wolves", "Thunderheart, "Squanto", "Geronimo" and "The Last of the Mohicans" serve up romantic myths, treating Native Americans with a mixture of reverence, nostalgia and melancholy. Released at the end of this wave, Walter Hill's "Geronimo" focuses on the "Geronimo Campaign", a period of history between 1885 and 1886 in which five thousand US cavalry men attempted to hunt and kill a group of Apache Indians. As is typical of these films, the US Cavalry is portrayed as an aggressive invader whilst the Indians are treated as a band of unfairly persecuted freedom fighters. With the Apaches placed in reservations (ie, concentration camps), caged in trains like Holocaust victims and betrayed by fellow Indians seduced by the false promises of white men, the film is implicitly critical of a certain brand of Colonialism. It's all familiar stuff, very superficially drawn, but the film nevertheless differentiates itself from revisionist westerns in several ways. It revokes the clich&eacute; of having an enlightened white man shedding his white ways and fighting for the red skins, and instead adopts a tone of total futility. Here, the battle is already lost, the natives already defeated, and our white hero has long resigned to the horrors of his own actions. Thus, rather than having a white man joining forces with the natives and taking up arms with them against the invaders - your typical "Avatar" narrative - we have a white man attempting to reason with natives such that they accept their own loss. Such that they come to terms with their defeat and stop wasting the lives of their few remaining tribesmen in a futile fight against a technologically and numerically superior foe. Because of this stance, the film plays less like a drama or action fantasy, than a kind of detached tragedy. The weight of a hundred years of history has already determined the outcome of the film, the typical Hollywood fantasies (the flights of fancy where audiences woop with joy as the Indians rebel) rejected entirely. The battle is over. Victory is impossible. History is defeat. This may make for less satisfying viewing, but it gets under your skin. Another bold choice is the resignation of the white officer at the end of the film. Whilst most films in this genre actualise the white man's rage by having him join forces with the enemy and fight against his homeland, the truth is, "doing nothing" is often a much braver act.

    Wes Studi, so hateful in LAST OF THE MOHICANS, is about as sympathetic a character as you can get in GERONIMO, and Walter Hill's direction is about as tight as it gets (which is saying a lot for a director of Hill's caliber). The cinematography, if nothing else, should've won some kind of award. One thing I would've liked to have seen in a movie like this is the root cause of The American Indian Wars. According to Robert M. Utley, it all began when Indians were being starved by buffalo hunters out for furs, who decimated the great herds, leaving the meat to rot and the Natives to starve. At a meeting called between the townsfolk and the Indians, one townie reportedly said: "If they're hungry, let 'em eat grass." When the smoke cleared, the townie was found dead, with his mouth stuffed full of grass. A LOT of mythinformation came out of the genocide that followed. General Custer, a Civil War vet, was nicknamed "The Son of the Morning Star" because he liked to attack unguarded Indian villages at sunup. His preferred method was to wait for the braves to go off to hunt, leaving the women, children, and elderly alone and unarmed. Sherman, another vet who put the South to the torch, coined a popular phrase when he said that "the only GOOD Indian is a DEAD Indian." U.$. Army soldiers, foreshadowing the likes of the Nazis and Ed Gein, made purses from the genitalia of murdered Indian women (it's out there; look it up). GERONIMO is and isn't historically accurate; what it most definitely IS is a great movie.

    Geronimo: An American Legend is directed by Walter Hill and written by John Milius. It stars Wes Studi, Jason Patric, Robert Duvall, Gene Hackman, Matt Damon and Pato Hoffman. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern. Story tells of what led Geronimo to being the most wanted Apache warrior on the American Government list, and his subsequent capture/surrender in 1886. Walter Hill takes his Westerns seriously, striving for authenticity in look, feel and narrative. He achieves all of these in Geronimo, only that this is hardly a biography of Geronimo the man. Film chronicles the great Apache leader courtesy of the memoirs of one of the cavalrymen who hunted him down, this thread is surrounded by historical points of worth such as land rights, the changing of the West, cultural clashes, racism and etc. Add in some lush Utah photography, traditional Western staples such as horseback chases, fights and shootouts, and it's just under two hours of good Western movie entertainment. But the screenplay doesn't open up Geronimo the man, in fact not really affording the excellent Studi (Geronimo) all that much screen time in the process. Film would have been better titled as Geronimo, Charles B. Gatewood (Patric) and Britton Davis (Damon), since the latter two are dealt with as much as the Apache warrior is. It's a good film that only deals in under two years of the Geronimo Campaign. Yes it redresses the balance by attempting to show both sides of the coin, and for sure it isn't found wanting for accuracy. But under developing the title character is a major problem. This should have been much much better and leaves us still waiting for a definitive Geronimo story. 6/10

    Walter Hill's biopic of the Apache hero brings to life the political struggle between Native Americans and the US army in the 19th century. It's a fast paced, well made movie that's more educational than everything else; as a viewer to whom the story was completely new, I enjoyed learning about the tensions and situations along with the historical backdrop. However, I can't help but feel the film is lacking something: it has a made for TV feel and never has the 'bite' or heart that make other biopics so affecting. This one goes through the motions and utilises a powerful cast to bring the characters to life, but you watch it in the same way you watch a history documentary: to learn rather than feel. The blame has to go to John Milius's script, I think. Still, both Hackman and Duvall contribute seasoned turns as grizzled old war veterans, and it's great to see a fresh-faced Matt Damon taking on a leading role and handling it comfortably so early on in his career. What a surprise, too, to discover that Jason Patric (THE LOST BOYS) could actually act back in the day. The best cast member is Wes Studi as Geronimo himself: playing his character stony-faced most of the time, he gets the man's humility, strength and sense of quiet honour just right.

    first let me say the this is a graphic movie lots of shootouts and bloody wounds its rated pg-13 for frontier violence witch i think it should have been rated R for frontier violence.the acting was wonderful by Gene Hackman and Wes Studi, now Jason Patric was mostly bull and boring.for people looking for a accurate history movie this isn't for you but if you like a good western drama like Dancing With Wolves this is for you. now Geronimo is in no way better than The Last Of The Mohicans or Dancing With Wolves but this is a good movie to relax, kick up your feet and lay on the couch for 2 hours with family member or friend and enjoy the movie about the legend of Geronimo

    "I don't feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them. There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves."  John Wayne (interview) "Two thousand years of history, could not be wiped away so easily."  Bob Marley "The Indians must conform to "the white man's ways," peaceably if they will, forcibly if they must. They must adjust themselves to their environment, and conform their mode of living substantially to our civilization. This civilization may not be the best possible, but it is the best the Indians can get. They cannot escape it, and must either conform to it or be crushed by it. The tribal relations should be broken up, socialism destroyed, and the family and the autonomy of the individual substituted." - Commissioner Thomas Morgan After demonizing Native American Indians for several decades, Hollywood suddenly began releasing a slew of revisionist westerns in the late 60s and early 70s. Enter films like "Buffalo Bill", "Ulzana's Raid", "A Man Called Horse" and "Soldier Blue", all of which forced their audiences to empathise with subjugated natives whilst portraying the "white man" as genocidal brutes bent on conquest. Even John Ford, one-time king of racist caricatures, tried to make amends with "Cheyenne Autumn", his apology for past pictures. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, French, Italian and British film-makers were treading similar ground. With the dismantling of the British Empire, British directors began releasing a spread of anti Colonial war films, whilst European directors like Gavras, Wertmuller and Pontecorvo protested the treatment of Algerians and the aggressions of the French Empire. With the battle for history won, films in the early 90s then began to treat this subject in a much more elegiac fashion. Films like "Dances With Wolves", "Thunderheart, "Squanto", "Geronimo" and "The Last of the Mohicans" serve up romantic myths, treating Native Americans with a mixture of reverence, nostalgia and melancholy. Released at the end of this wave, Walter Hill's "Geronimo" focuses on the "Geronimo Campaign", a period of history between 1885 and 1886 in which five thousand US cavalry men attempted to hunt and kill a group of Apache Indians. As is typical of these films, the US Cavalry is portrayed as an aggressive invader whilst the Indians are treated as a band of unfairly persecuted freedom fighters. With the Apaches placed in reservations (ie, concentration camps), caged in trains like Holocaust victims and betrayed by fellow Indians seduced by the false promises of white men, the film is implicitly critical of a certain brand of Colonialism. It's all familiar stuff, very superficially drawn, but the film nevertheless differentiates itself from revisionist westerns in several ways. It revokes the clich&eacute; of having an enlightened white man shedding his white ways and fighting for the red skins, and instead adopts a tone of total futility. Here, the battle is already lost, the natives already defeated, and our white hero has long resigned to the horrors of his own actions. Thus, rather than having a white man joining forces with the natives and taking up arms with them against the invaders - your typical "Avatar" narrative - we have a white man attempting to reason with natives such that they accept their own loss. Such that they come to terms with their defeat and stop wasting the lives of their few remaining tribesmen in a futile fight against a technologically and numerically superior foe. Because of this stance, the film plays less like a drama or action fantasy, than a kind of detached tragedy. The weight of a hundred years of history has already determined the outcome of the film, the typical Hollywood fantasies (the flights of fancy where audiences woop with joy as the Indians rebel) rejected entirely. The battle is over. Victory is impossible. History is defeat. This may make for less satisfying viewing, but it gets under your skin. Another bold choice is the resignation of the white officer at the end of the film. Whilst most films in this genre actualise the white man's rage by having him join forces with the enemy and fight against his homeland, the truth is, "doing nothing" is often a much braver act. Violence is not necessarily action. Social structures are run by action, and, contrary to popular opinion, it is violence that makes sure things stay the way they are. Sometimes the truly violent act is to do nothing, a radical refusal often undermining the status quo. Sometimes the only authentic stance to take in dark times is to do nothing, to refuse all commitment (see Renoir's "The Devil Probably"). 7.9/10 - Though directed by Walter Hill, screenwriter John Milius is the real auteur of this picture. Milius' lug-headed politics and passions ooze from every scene, whilst director Walter Hill is simply content to use the tale as an excuse to indulge in his love for his mentors, Peckinpah and Siegel. The film is perhaps better than "Dances With Wolves", but loses points for some middlebrow sermonising. And though critical of US Calvary men and policy makers, the film is nevertheless heavily whitewashed, too fearful to deal with some of the darker truths which occurred during the era. See "Europa Europa".

    Some say that Geronimo: An American Legend is revisionist but there is no getting away from the fact that this movie is poorly made hokum. The story begins and firmly stays with the point of view of the white man. One of the first scenes sets the tone for the following nonsense by having the American Cavalry officer played by Gene Hackman stress to his men the desire to allow the Indian women and children to escape to safety before they ride in to capture the renegade Indians. This cynical attempt at stressing the concern or at least the benevolence of the American Cavalry is ridiculous considering the well documented indiscriminate slaughter of Indian women and children perpetrated by American forces in the west. This travesty continues with Charles B. Gatewood played with angelic wetness by Jason Patric espousing an extraordinary and relentless knowledge of Apache customs, beliefs and spirituality to the young impressionable Lt. Britton Davis (Matt Damon). Ignorance and a want to stay ignorant of the Indian and their beliefs was standard for US soldiers and civilians alike at the time. The image of the Red Indian as created by Hollywood is perpetuated in this production without any attempt to shed new light on the subject. The revisionist Hollywood clich&eacute; is that the American Forces accidentally start the carnage and slaughter because of some simple misunderstanding. That the brutality is somehow impelled because of some small yet legitimate action by the Indian. Flying in the face of documented history, the general impression created by Hollywood is that the wholesale murder of the Red Indian was all a terrible mistake. The fact that Geronimo was never made a Chief because he was too impetuous and irresponsible is not broached. He is seen talking as if a Chief with retrained wisdom and thought. Many of Geromimo's own tribe found him to be dangerous and unreliable. Some still to this day wonder why Geronimo has become such an icon for white America. On a technical level this production is shot like a TV movie and the editing is especially bad. The dialogue is atrocious and unoriginal, an example being when Geronimo shoots a jug out of the hand of a Marshall at distance "That was a good shot!"......."No, I was aiming for his head!"

    This is a beautifully filmed and clearly told movie. The politically correct aspect about the injustices towards the Native population wasn't rammed down your throat. It was just matter of factly shown with greater impact. A little more of Geronimo's life prior to the start of the incidents in this movie could have been shown. Matt Damon is good as the idealistic young officer. Jason Patric is quite convincing too. There aren't too many annoying and one dimensionally good or evil characters like in some of the other recent movies of this genre. Do watch it if you can.

    Walter Hill is a true, seasoned action deliverer. Just look at his stellar films and this is why his one of my favourite directors. Still need to see his highly regarded western "The Long Riders" though. Nevertheless his take on the American legend "Geronimo" was not what I was expecting. It's quite a tone down piece (but not on the drama front), still his professional handling of the bravado action contains that walloping punch we have come to expect (like the sequence in a Mexican bar), but the thoughtfully mediative (if a tad stuffy and not entirely correct) material (by John Milius) and productively detailed characters are what takes centre stage. The outstanding performances led by a cast of Gene Hackman, Robert Duvall, Jason Patric, Wes Studi, Matt Damon, Rodney A. Grant and Kevin Tighe really do cement the humane edge of brave men with moralistic stances. Patric is a revelation in his role, bringing the right idealistic balance and so is a pre-stardom Damon. Duvall brings a solidly noble complexity and Hackman aims up with one of his respectably collected turns. Studi is picture-perfect as Geronimo, who embraces the legend and crafts out a mythical mark. Hill mechanically stages it with a certain ruggedness that's never lost amongst its fetching tailoring, as he does a presentable job covering the sprawling Arizona and Utah foregrounds in getting every little detail of the terrain into the shot. While not flashy, the imagery does linger (as well as some explosive and bloody confrontations) and the scenic cinematography is earthly projected for a genuine look and feel. Ry Cooder (a prolific contributor for Hill) orchestrates a poignantly majestic and spiritually mannered score that enhances its epic framework. A favourably gripping western.

    Despite the creative presence of Walter Hill and John Milius behind it, the movie gets a lot of things wrong. Matt Damon's grating voice-over is handled with little care and is nothing more than the grappling hook that drags the movie from one episode to the next as though we're reading an encyclopedic entry rather than watching a fully fleshed movie. The point-of-view is never allowed to remain within one side or group of characters long enough for them to come alive as anything than cutouts from a history page. We don't stay long enough to learn the actual problems that plagued the Chiricahua (and other Apache bands) in the San Carlos and White River reservations and we don't stay long enough with General Crook and his cavalry to begin to understand the tightrope the sympathetic General (who no less came to the Southwest after slaughtering Cheyennes in the North) has to walk in trying to appease an anxious government in the East while doing his best to save what remains of the Apaches from the encroachment of white settlers into their lands. As a piece of history the movie is naturally inadequate because the Indian affairs in the Southwest were more complex than a movie can afford to depict. As a gritty western action movie (the kind which Walter Hill is the expert) it's too sprawling and incoherent to ever get enough steam. We get the occasional slow-motion gunfight and a pretty good saloon standoff but they're not enough to save the movie from rumbling mediocrity.

    Regardless of the absolute historical veracity of the film, GERONIMO:AN American LEGEND is, first and foremost, an engaging piece of motion picture entertainment. Written by John Milius, and directed by Walter Hill (with a dynamite soundtrack by Ry Cooder), the film attempts an evenhanded examination of the final chapters in America's war-torn and bloody relationship with The Apache Nation. Most historians would agree that the government of the United States enacted legislative policies concerning the Apache which were less than honest, and led to senseless acts of mayhem and violence. America's inept handling of these Native Americans attests to the sad fact that spurious 'short-term fixes' very often can lead to onerous and unintended diplomatic protocol. Neither the US or the Indians could claim the moral or ethical high ground, because such a position did not exist. Both sides were guilty of genocidal madness. At least this film attempts to present the issues and shed some light on the reasons that led to this decades long, violent and ill fated conflict. Jason Patric, as 1st Lt. Charles B. Gatewood, and Wes Studi, as Geronimo, convincingly embody the conflicting aims and strategies of the United States Government and the Apache Nation. Each man is portrayed as an honorable individual who tries to find common ground in an impossible situation where neither man has complete control. The film is a deft balancing act between an action adventure motion picture, and a thoughtful meditation on an almost insoluble clash between two cultures. THREE AND A HALF STARS.

    Wes Studi, so hateful in LAST OF THE MOHICANS, is about as sympathetic a character as you can get in GERONIMO, and Walter Hill's direction is about as tight as it gets (which is saying a lot for a director of Hill's caliber). The cinematography, if nothing else, should've won some kind of award. One thing I would've liked to have seen in a movie like this is the root cause of The American Indian Wars. According to Robert M. Utley, it all began when Indians were being starved by buffalo hunters out for furs, who decimated the great herds, leaving the meat to rot and the Natives to starve. At a meeting called between the townsfolk and the Indians, one townie reportedly said: "If they're hungry, let 'em eat grass." When the smoke cleared, the townie was found dead, with his mouth stuffed full of grass. A LOT of mythinformation came out of the genocide that followed. General Custer, a Civil War vet, was nicknamed "The Son of the Morning Star" because he liked to attack unguarded Indian villages at sunup. His preferred method was to wait for the braves to go off to hunt, leaving the women, children, and elderly alone and unarmed. Sherman, another vet who put the South to the torch, coined a popular phrase when he said that "the only GOOD Indian is a DEAD Indian." U.$. Army soldiers, foreshadowing the likes of the Nazis and Ed Gein, made purses from the genitalia of murdered Indian women (it's out there; look it up). GERONIMO is and isn't historically accurate; what it most definitely IS is a great movie.

The dialogue is atrocious and unoriginal, an example being when Geronimo shoots a jug out of the hand of a Marshall at distance "That was a good shot!"......."No, I was aiming for his head!"

    This is a beautifully filmed and clearly told movie. The politically correct aspect about the injustices towards the Native population wasn't rammed down your throat. It was just matter of factly shown with greater impact. A little more of Geronimo's life prior to the start of the incidents in this movie could have been shown. Matt Damon is good as the idealistic young officer. Jason Patric is quite convincing too. There aren't too many annoying and one dimensionally good or evil characters like in some of the other recent movies of this genre. Do watch it if you can.

    Walter Hill is a true, seasoned action deliverer. Just look at his stellar films and this is why his one of my favourite directors. Still need to see his highly regarded western "The Long Riders" though. Nevertheless his take on the American legend "Geronimo" was not what I was expecting. It's quite a tone down piece (but not on the drama front), still his professional handling of the bravado action contains that walloping punch we have come to expect (like the sequence in a Mexican bar), but the thoughtfully mediative (if a tad stuffy and not entirely correct) material (by John Milius) and productively detailed characters are what takes centre stage. The outstanding performances led by a cast of Gene Hackman, Robert Duvall, Jason Patric, Wes Studi, Matt Damon, Rodney A. Grant and Kevin Tighe really do cement the humane edge of brave men with moralistic stances. Patric is a revelation in his role, bringing the right idealistic balance and so is a pre-stardom Damon. Duvall brings a solidly noble complexity and Hackman aims up with one of his respectably collected turns. Studi is picture-perfect as Geronimo, who embraces the legend and crafts out a mythical mark. Hill mechanically stages it with a certain ruggedness that's never lost amongst its fetching tailoring, as he does a presentable job covering the sprawling Arizona and Utah foregrounds in getting every little detail of the terrain into the shot. While not flashy, the imagery does linger (as well as some explosive and bloody confrontations) and the scenic cinematography is earthly projected for a genuine look and feel. Ry Cooder (a prolific contributor for Hill) orchestrates a poignantly majestic and spiritually mannered score that enhances its epic framework. A favourably gripping western.

    Despite the creative presence of Walter Hill and John Milius behind it, the movie gets a lot of things wrong. Matt Damon's grating voice-over is handled with little care and is nothing more than the grappling hook that drags the movie from one episode to the next as though we're reading an encyclopedic entry rather than watching a fully fleshed movie. The point-of-view is never allowed to remain within one side or group of characters long enough for them to come alive as anything than cutouts from a history page. We don't stay long enough to learn the actual problems that plagued the Chiricahua (and other Apache bands) in the San Carlos and White River reservations and we don't stay long enough with General Crook and his cavalry to begin to understand the tightrope the sympathetic General (who no less came to the Southwest after slaughtering Cheyennes in the North) has to walk in trying to appease an anxious government in the East while doing his best to save what remains of the Apaches from the encroachment of white settlers into their lands. As a piece of history the movie is naturally inadequate because the Indian affairs in the Southwest were more complex than a movie can afford to depict. As a gritty western action movie (the kind which Walter Hill is the expert) it's too sprawling and incoherent to ever get enough steam. We get the occasional slow-motion gunfight and a pretty good saloon standoff but they're not enough to save the movie from rumbling mediocrity.

    Regardless of the absolute historical veracity of the film, GERONIMO:AN American LEGEND is, first and foremost, an engaging piece of motion picture entertainment. Written by John Milius, and directed by Walter Hill (with a dynamite soundtrack by Ry Cooder), the film attempts an evenhanded examination of the final chapters in America's war-torn and bloody relationship with The Apache Nation. Most historians would agree that the government of the United States enacted legislative policies concerning the Apache which were less than honest, and led to senseless acts of mayhem and violence. America's inept handling of these Native Americans attests to the sad fact that spurious 'short-term fixes' very often can lead to onerous and unintended diplomatic protocol. Neither the US or the Indians could claim the moral or ethical high ground, because such a position did not exist. Both sides were guilty of genocidal madness. At least this film attempts to present the issues and shed some light on the reasons that led to this decades long, violent and ill fated conflict. Jason Patric, as 1st Lt. Charles B. Gatewood, and Wes Studi, as Geronimo, convincingly embody the conflicting aims and strategies of the United States Government and the Apache Nation. Each man is portrayed as an honorable individual who tries to find common ground in an impossible situation where neither man has complete control. The film is a deft balancing act between an action adventure motion picture, and a thoughtful meditation on an almost insoluble clash between two cultures. THREE AND A HALF STARS.
