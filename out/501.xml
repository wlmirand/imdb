    The 70th anniversary Blu-Ray of Dumbo is a must have for Disney fans and classic animation fans alike. The movie has been restored beautifully, showcasing the charming water-colored backgrounds, and the animation just pops off the screen in High-Def, like a living painting. Years ago when I seen a documentary about how Disney was using computers to clean up their classic animated films frame by frame I wasn't sure how the result would be, but the movie looks like it was just made, and not in a bad way. The sound is equally well restored, not over-blown but above and beyond most movies over 70 years old. A huge improvement over the DVD release from 2001. The movie if you are one of the few people on earth not familiar with the tale, is about a baby elephant with extremely large ears, named Jumbo Jr, but after being mocked the name "Dumbo" sticks. Despite this, with the help of his friend, a mouse, Timothy Q. Mouse, he soars above his bullies in more ways than one. Dumbo is presented in it's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and you can chose to watch it with black bars on the sides, or changing art panels that reflect each scene. There is also a Cine-Explore experience, with historians and animators taking you through the movie, a deleted scene and song, a documentary on the making of the film, a feturette called Celebrating Dumbo, and one on the ride at Disney Land, an audio commentary, a pair of classic Disney Shorts "The Flying Mouse" and "Elmer Elephant" (both in HD as are most the special features), and some games for the kids. A nice package for a classic film. RATING: MOVIE: 10 out of 10 AUDIO/VIDEO: 9 out of 10, 10 out of 10 EXTRAS: 9 out of 10

    I think it's pretty safe to say that we all have been in the same shoes as the main character of Walt Disney's 4th animated feature Dumbo (1941) at least once in our lives before. Anyone who had either seen this picture or had been picked on and/or bullied in school knows what it feels like to go through whatever the main character goes through in this film. The biggest reason why Dumbo has always been one of Disney's most timeless animated treasures is because so many of us can identify with the sadness and pain that the title character feels from all the unfortunate circumstances he's put under. Obviously, that isn't the only reason why Dumbo still holds up well after all these years, but more on that later. Our main character of this film is a baby elephant named Dumbo who is ridiculed by fellow circus animals and humans for his enormous ears. His mother Jumbo is the only elephant who is kind to Dumbo and willing to defend him. But when she gets into trouble for trying to protect Dumbo from harm, she gets locked up in a cage and Dumbo is now alone. That's when a circus mouse named Timothy Mouse comes in and becomes his only friend outside his mother. Timothy promises to do whatever he can to help Dumbo overcome his obstacle by making it into his strength. Right off the bat, I should say that I thought it was ingenious to make Dumbo's best friend a mouse, given that elephants are supposed to be afraid of mice for whatever reasons. I liked how even though sad things keep happening to Dumbo, he's the only elephant in the circus that has a mouse for a friend. That was a very clever idea on the writer's part. I also found Dumbo's relationship with his mom to be deeply touching and emotional. The filmmakers were wise to keep the dialogue out of the scenes between Dumbo and his mom and let the heartwarming images drawn by the Disney animators do the talking so to speak. Remember a brief scene early on when Jumbo wraps Dumbo's ears into a blanket and gently rocks him back and forth with her trunk? That was a cute little scene. You couldn't make this part of the movie better with dialogue since it manages to work perfectly well as it is. Speaking of great scenes, how about that infamous pink elephants sequence? Make all the arguments you like about how it contributes little to the plot and how a certain scene before it could send the wrong message to kids with Dumbo and Timothy Mouse accidentally consuming alcohol. That pink elephants scene is still a cool scene to watch. Considering the time in which it came out and all of the bright, colorful and surreal imagery being shown on screen, that scene was really ahead of its time in terms of its content. In regards to the controversy involving the crows that help Dumbo discover his true destiny and whether or not they are racist, I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about. In my opinion, they were just cool, free-spirited creatures who are just enjoying life. On top of that, the main leader of the group was voiced by a white person (Cliff Edwards to be precise, who's also famous for his voice-over work for Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio (1940)), so it makes the argument a tad less credible. Personally, nothing about these crows would've offended me if I was an African-American. If there was a scene that would have offended me if I were an African-American, it would be the Roustabouts song earlier in the film. I'm shocked that for all the controversy with the crows, how come no one seems to be offended by the Roustabouts scene? It clearly involves African-American slaves setting up the circus tents along with the circus animals. If that wasn't enough for this scene to repel any African-Americans, then some of the lyrics are. I swear I heard these very words somewhere in the songÂ… "We don't know when we get our pay, and when we do we throw our pay away". They're basically saying that they're enjoying being hard-working slaves and that they only enjoy living for that reason. I guess it just goes to show you how complicated race issues can really become, but I just think America was calling racism on the wrong part of the movie. In the tradition of the best Disney pictures, another one of the film's strengths is in its music and songs arranged by Frank Churchill, Oliver Wallace, and Ned Washington. Along with its wide range of music whether it's softer music or circus music, the film's songs are still memorable to this day especially "Casey Junior", "Baby Mine" and "When I See An Elephant Fly". The music and songs have noteworthy variety to them and they are all handled very well. The animation was intended to be a little less advanced than the three previous Disney films before it (Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia), but it's still well done in its own right. The animation compliments the simple story that is being told well enough. There's no need to remake it and advance the animation further, it somehow works just fine as it is. Dumbo was intended to be a simpler film than the previous Disney animated features before it both with its animation and its story. And yet, it manages to equal and even top the three Disney films that came before it because it has the best balance of everything that made Disney films terrific to begin with. Even with a brief running time of just over an hour, Dumbo is more evidence that a great film which lasts just over an hour is preferable to a lousy film that lasts around two hours.

    Like 'Snow White,' this is one old Disney film that made me both cry and smile. I watched this film on a flight home from Dubai a few months ago after not having seen it since I was a child. Also as a child, I had a small cuddly toy of Dumbo that I was probably given when I was a baby. This film is rather sophisticated for its time due to its fluid animation and detailed backgrounds throughout. Pretty much all the songs are memorable. While the majority of them are uplifting (in particular 'Casey Jr' and 'Pink Elephants on Parade - their accompanying scenes also stand out very well,') the saddest one for me is 'Baby of Mine.' It made me cry when I was little and it still makes me cry now. Other than that, most of the characters are well-designed, especially Dumbo, Timothy Mouse, Dumbo's mother and the other female elephants; however I found the designs of the boys who taunted Dumbo and were beaten by his mother before she was deemed a mad elephant somewhat old-fashioned as well as the opening cards. Nevertheless, these aspects are forgivable for the film's era. The film's pace was relatively swift as well due to its length of just over an hour. Overall this is a timeless film that was worth re-visiting, albeit the tear-jerking 'Baby of Mine' sequence and a couple of old-fashioned aspects. 8/10.

    Dumbo is among the original Disney masterpieces, and masterpiece it is! My review is probably not necessary because most people have seen it by now, but I feel the need to include it because it is one of my favorite Disney Originals. Dumbo has the lovable circus characters, a funny little mouse and who can ever forget the Pink Elephants On Parade scene? I think Disney nailed this one by not making Dumbo a talking character because it makes his emotions on his face and in his actions all the more powerful. There is classic, circus-based soundtracks that add to the excitement, and of course the famous Baby Mine scene that was good enough to have been covered by many celebrities including Bette Midler. Classic family fun!

    Hands down, Dumbo will always be a Disney animation classic. The plot is rather simple, it's your basic Rudolph the Reindeer type of a story of a child who is a different to the point that makes them outcast amongst society. They get laugh at, discrimination, or mistreated. In this case, it's Dumbo's ears. It's a simple story of overcoming a difference that life threw at you and finding out how you can adapt to it. This may be a simple story but for me, it works for me and really, it's the characters that help to sell the story. Based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson, the story is about Jumbo JR who is cruelly mock to the point, that he was 'nickname' Dumbo. I love all his expressions are expressed through body language seeing as he doesn't talk but that comes from the fact that he's just a baby but even still, it works in the film and even without the dialogue, it is easy to pick up on Dumbo's emotions. His only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy (Edward Brophy). While the elephants don't like the mouse, Dumbo finds a paternal figure in him while his mother is locked up trying to protect him. While the movie loves to point out that this is a flying Elephant movie, in truth, Dumbo only flies in the last 10 minutes of the film. This is where the plot device comes into play. On his journey of self-discovery, Dumbo meets a group of Crows that teach Dumbo how to fly using a Magic Feather. It wasn't magic, as it was meant to give him a boost in courage. Now there has been a bunch of controversial about the black crows. In my opinion, I don't find it racist. The racism accusations around the crows usually centers somewhat around the fact that the leader crow is named, "Jim." It's making a joke out of the Jim Crow laws. The crow leader is the only white actor playing a crow. It's Cliff Edwards (the voice of Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio). I do like James Baskett as one of the crows. He will play Uncle Remus in Song of the South later on his career adding more to the controversial. Now as far as the crow debate goes, I never had any problems with them at all since in turn, they were integral to Dumbo's growth in the end. They were cool then and still are cool now. I guess I can see how they could be considered a bit racially insensitive, but even then it was portraying non-negative stereotypes, not negative ones. It wasn't like they were picking at watermelon slices, eating fried chicken or anything. Yes, the crows were portrayed akin to a very popular racial stereotype, "the Sambo." The Sambo is portrayed as a lazy, ignorant and enthusiastic bum. Like other racial stereotypes, such as The Mammy, the Tom and so on, they were popularized portrayals used in racist minstrel shows. The decision to name the lead crow Jim, in tandem with portraying the crows as Sambo stereotypes, makes the Crows more of an insult aimed at the civil rights movement and their efforts than innocent, plucky birds. The fact that Disney managed to disguise this racism in the form of innocent, plucky birds and marketed it makes it kind of insidious. Still, this band of crows that are cool, funny, clever and snarky. True, they start out a little cold hearted, but ultimately show to be very upright people underneath once they learn of Dumbo's plight and help him accomplish the impossible. In fact, taken in context, they're the only morally decent characters besides Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy. All the other "white" characters are portrayed as haughty, selfish, big headed, mean, ignorant, and hurtful. The gossipy elephants, the cruel circus children, the pompous ring leader, and the horrible clowns all in some way hurt or endanger Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo for self-gain. Plus, "When I See a Elephant Fly" is one of the cleverest, funniest, and catchiest songs in a Disney movie. The other good song was "Baby Mine", I have no regrets in admitting that every time the song comes on, I always cry. Despite what I may feel or whatever goes on with the family, it brings back to joy and comfort that I cry in a good way for loving my family. The only reason Dumbo's mother is in there in the first place is because she was trying to protect him, he can't really see her and they can't touch much. Add that to the song itself, then the fact that they show all the other baby animals in the circus asleep with their mother's. So yeah, Disney really know how to make a tearjerker when they want to. The other songs are pointless. The Pink Elephants on Parade scene scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid, and wasn't needed. Look Out for Mr. Stork is a catchy barber song. Still, dated and was a bit odd. If you're on birth control he won't find you. It's time for lemonade and cracker jacks Casey junior's back was bad. The animation was simplicity due to an animators strike. It was a deliberate pursuit due to that, as Pinoccohio and Fantasia were both flops at the time due to the work detail need for those films. If Dumbo wasn't a success, Disney would have closed down its studios since they lost a lot of money on those films. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. The animators wouldn't have return until the following year with Bambi. A number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns. Overall: Dumbo is emotional, atmosphere works fast paced, energetic and fun.

    Dumbo was released a year after Fantasia in 1941. This film is about a male elephant who was born with huge ears gets constantly made fun of by the other elephants in the circus, and the humans. After a boy goes too far into picking on Dumbo, his mother goes crazy, and gets locked up in a speedster place for crazy animals. Dumbo then gets put into an act where he falls a ridiculously high distance. Will he be able to shine in the circus? This film may not be as good as the previous three, it is still a good quality film. A bit on the short side, you way to know what happens next in the plot. The characters are all endearing; Dumbo has a clear personality (even though he does not talk) and you do feel sorry for him, the mouse that helps Dumbo is a cute and entertaining character. The crows are hilarious, and are definitely one of the best aspects of the movie, and the mother elephant is a typical mother who watches out for their kid. The songs are pretty good as well. "Baby Mine" is a slow, emotional, melodic tune, "When I See An Elephant Fly" is an upbeat track that makes you want to dance, and the score is very good as well. The animation is not as good as the previous 3 (because of its small budget), but it is still very interesting, and you could tell that they animated it, so it could stand out from the other films. The Pink Elephant scene is so cool. The way that they go about and move is so brilliant and is beyond words. This is ranked lower than the others because although it is a great film, it is a bit too short (a bit over an hour), and the fact that it does not leave much of an impact on you like the others do. I think that if the film was a bit longer, you would get a bit more invested into it. If you want to watch a short, entertaining family movie, Dumbo is the movie to go to.

    One of the shortest, the cheapest and simplest of Disney's animated films, Dumbo also happens to be one of the best. Stung by the fall-out from Fantasia, Disney returned to the story telling qualities that had made Pinocchio so successful. The simple story finds a baby elephant born with over sized ears who is separated from his mother when she's locked away for trying to protect him. Ostracised by his own kind and a figure of fun to the human public, Dumbo skulks away with his only friend, Timothy Q. Mouse. At the pinnacle of their adventure together, Dumbo discovers he has a talent, a talent that will change his life forever. And that's all there is to it. Only it's a picture that pulls on a myriad of emotions, it's funny, sad, exciting, and a great message movie as well. Delightful for the kids and ever watchable for adults of all ages, it's totally reliant on the animals for characterisations, where amazingly Dumbo is the one animal on show who doesn't speak! But it matters not, such is Disney when on top form, the animation is so great that just from Dumbo's expressions we know how he is feeling. Some wonderful tunes in here as well, including the quite beautiful "Baby Mine", while a surreal hallucination sequence (Pink Elephants On Parade) that plays out as Dumbo and Timothy accidentally drink liquor, is remarkable. There has been some balking at the black characterisations via some jaunty and funky crows, but they are immensely funny and for 1941 they be crafted with love and there's not a hint of being aware to racial stereotypes. Disney "A" League is Dumbo. 10/10

    Mere months before the U.S. entered World War II, Disney released its fourth major animated film, "Dumbo." At an unusually short 63 minutes, "Dumbo" tells a simple story of an elephant separated from his mother and picked on for his over-sized ears, who with the help of a circus mouse, must learn to love and believe in himself. "Dumbo" is really a short film padded by artistic sequences set to moving, Oscar-winning music. It opens with storks delivering babies to all the animals involved in a traveling circus. The kangaroo gets her baby, the tiger gets her babies and even the hippo gets her baby, but poor Mrs. Jumbo the elephant is left empty-handed. This sets the tone for the alienation both she and her soon-to-arrive child, Jumbo Jr., will experience throughout the film. When Mr. Stork (Sterling Holloway) eventually delivers Jumbo Jr., he and his mother become a laughing stock when the other lady elephants see his gigantic ears, nicknaming him "Dumbo." At one point at a circus stop, several spectators tease Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo goes mad with rage. The Ringmaster (Herman Bing) has her chained up in a train car and Dumbo is left to fend for himself Â— until he's befriended by Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy). Timothy thinks Dumbo's ears suit him well and believes he could be a star. He becomes Dumbo's life coach and only companion. The tender relationship between Dumbo and his mother (which would become a major dynamic in Disney's next film, "Bambi") is the emotional core of the film. Neither character speaks, and so the animators must focus on telling that story through the animation. At one point, a deflated Dumbo reunites with his confined mother and she cradles him in her trunk through the barred windows of the train car as the song "Baby Mine" plays, a timeless lullaby. Even Timothy sheds a tear. It's the most powerful scene in the film and testament to Disney's legacy. "Dumbo" has lots of unforgettable sequences peppered throughout that accompany the extremely basic narrative arc of how wide-eyed Dumbo gets separated from mom, feels shame and embarrassment for who he is and then accepts and believes in himself. Not all of them make sense and many are of questionable appropriateness, but they give "Dumbo" it's unique stamp among the Disney classics. "Song of the Roustabouts," for example, is a terrifying sequence in which the elephants, along with several African-American laborers, pitch the Big Top tent in the middle of a booming thunderstorm. The way light flashes and the wind whips water all about creates a fascinating mood, but the juxtaposition of circus animal labor and the presumed labor of free but unequal blacks makes it a strange scene to wedge into the beginning of the movie. "Pink Elephants on Parade" later in the movie is a visually daring and impressive sequence, but it's wildly inappropriate and arguably unnecessary. After Dumbo is made the butt of a joke in the clown act at the circus that proves successful, the clowns celebrate in their tent. Their liquor spikes the water bucket Dumbo and Timothy drink from and suddenly our main characters are having drunken hallucinations of color-changing elephants in a sequence clearly borrowing from the spirit of "Fantasia," which came out the year before. They wake up the next morning hanging from a tree, which leads Timothy to suppose Dumbo flew them up there in their drunken stupor. So, essentially, an accidental drunken episode leads to Dumbo's discovery of his amazing talent. At that point we meet the black crows, several jive-talking caricatures of African-Americans led by a character named Jim Crow (Cliff Edwards). Even if you assume the best of intentions on Disney's end, there's still a lot of insensitivity to be accounted for. At the same time, while they mock Dumbo at first, they apologize and are among few characters to be nice to him. Over time, these regrettable choices have given "Dumbo" its own unique flavor and helped it become a classic that stands on its own merits in Disney's canon, not a film that has simply been bolstered by the films made before and after it. Coming off "Fantasia" and "Pinocchio," "Dumbo" delivered the same emotional punch with less at its disposal in terms of story and visual detail. It's over in a flash, but "Dumbo" stands out with more than big ears. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com

    Dumbo (1941) **** (out of 4) One of Disney's greatest and cutest films centers on the elephant Dumbo, a small elephant with incredibly large ears. The large ears cause him to be picked on by many but with the help of his only friend, a mouse, he starts to be praised for what he can do. DUMBO is without question one of the studios greatest films and I think I'd say that it's also their very cutest. I think the characters here are among some of the best ever done for the studio and the screenplay is quite simple but it milks ever bit of emotion it can from the viewer. The most noticeable thing about watching this film today is how mean everyone in it is towards Dumbo. I'm sure most parents will be turned off by the behavior and I'm sure kids will be able to connect with Dumbo. There's no question that there's a message to be learned here and it's hard to believe that anyone could see this movie and not feel bad if they're the person picking on someone or get courage if they're the person being picked on. The story itself is quite simple and predictable but the characters from the leads to the supporting elephants to the crows are just so memorable and perfectly written. The songs here aren't quite as impressive as some of the other Disney films of this era but they're still pretty good. The animation is also quite simple but I thought this approach added for some beautiful scenes. DUMBO is clearly a film that works on so many levels and it remains one of the best of its kind.

    The classic Dumbo is a short movie about a cute little elephant who has self-image issues because of his big ears. It's a good lesson for kids everywhere - take what other people see as something bad about you and turn it into something positive. There's lots of animals in the animated movie, and we are introduced to most of them at the beginning of the movie. Storks are seen delivering babies everywhere - keeping with the old time explanation of "where do babies come from?" Other animals seen are bears, kangaroos, fish, tigers, giraffes, elephants, birds, monkeys, foxes, ostriches, snakes, horses, camels, zebras, hippos, gorillas, and even a mouse. Objects are person-fied in this movie. such as the train that talks. Animals are more like people then animals. The cut mouse who gives Dumbo his confidence, Mrs. Jumbo and her annoyingly rude companions, Mr. Stork. Comedy is written in a way that is funny for the adults as well as the children. I love when the stork is sitting on the cloud (every child imagines sitting on a cloud) and looking down on the earth at a map of the United States. The stork is constantly having to retrieve Dumbo as he sinks through the cloud. My favorite song is "When I See an Elephant Fly." Some negative elements: there is alcohol in this movie. We can see men drinking it, then later water is tainted with alcohol and the mouse and Dumbo are drunk. They have a wild vision...

    I think it's pretty safe to say that we all have been in the same shoes as the main character of Walt Disney's 4th animated feature Dumbo (1941) at least once in our lives before. Anyone who had either seen this picture or had been picked on and/or bullied in school knows what it feels like to go through whatever the main character goes through in this film. The biggest reason why Dumbo has always been one of Disney's most timeless animated treasures is because so many of us can identify with the sadness and pain that the title character feels from all the unfortunate circumstances he's put under. Obviously, that isn't the only reason why Dumbo still holds up well after all these years, but more on that later. Our main character of this film is a baby elephant named Dumbo who is ridiculed by fellow circus animals and humans for his enormous ears. His mother Jumbo is the only elephant who is kind to Dumbo and willing to defend him. But when she gets into trouble for trying to protect Dumbo from harm, she gets locked up in a cage and Dumbo is now alone. That's when a circus mouse named Timothy Mouse comes in and becomes his only friend outside his mother. Timothy promises to do whatever he can to help Dumbo overcome his obstacle by making it into his strength. Right off the bat, I should say that I thought it was ingenious to make Dumbo's best friend a mouse, given that elephants are supposed to be afraid of mice for whatever reasons. I liked how even though sad things keep happening to Dumbo, he's the only elephant in the circus that has a mouse for a friend. That was a very clever idea on the writer's part. I also found Dumbo's relationship with his mom to be deeply touching and emotional. The filmmakers were wise to keep the dialogue out of the scenes between Dumbo and his mom and let the heartwarming images drawn by the Disney animators do the talking so to speak. Remember a brief scene early on when Jumbo wraps Dumbo's ears into a blanket and gently rocks him back and forth with her trunk? That was a cute little scene. You couldn't make this part of the movie better with dialogue since it manages to work perfectly well as it is. Speaking of great scenes, how about that infamous pink elephants sequence? Make all the arguments you like about how it contributes little to the plot and how a certain scene before it could send the wrong message to kids with Dumbo and Timothy Mouse accidentally consuming alcohol. That pink elephants scene is still a cool scene to watch. Considering the time in which it came out and all of the bright, colorful and surreal imagery being shown on screen, that scene was really ahead of its time in terms of its content. In regards to the controversy involving the crows that help Dumbo discover his true destiny and whether or not they are racist, I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about. In my opinion, they were just cool, free-spirited creatures who are just enjoying life. On top of that, the main leader of the group was voiced by a white person (Cliff Edwards to be precise, who's also famous for his voice-over work for Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio (1940)), so it makes the argument a tad less credible. Personally, nothing about these crows would've offended me if I was an African-American. If there was a scene that would have offended me if I were an African-American, it would be the Roustabouts song earlier in the film. I'm shocked that for all the controversy with the crows, how come no one seems to be offended by the Roustabouts scene? It clearly involves African-American slaves setting up the circus tents along with the circus animals. If that wasn't enough for this scene to repel any African-Americans, then some of the lyrics are. I swear I heard these very words somewhere in the songÂ… "We don't know when we get our pay, and when we do we throw our pay away". They're basically saying that they're enjoying being hard-working slaves and that they only enjoy living for that reason. I guess it just goes to show you how complicated race issues can really become, but I just think America was calling racism on the wrong part of the movie. In the tradition of the best Disney pictures, another one of the film's strengths is in its music and songs arranged by Frank Churchill, Oliver Wallace, and Ned Washington. Along with its wide range of music whether it's softer music or circus music, the film's songs are still memorable to this day especially "Casey Junior", "Baby Mine" and "When I See An Elephant Fly". The music and songs have noteworthy variety to them and they are all handled very well. The animation was intended to be a little less advanced than the three previous Disney films before it (Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia), but it's still well done in its own right. The animation compliments the simple story that is being told well enough. There's no need to remake it and advance the animation further, it somehow works just fine as it is. Dumbo was intended to be a simpler film than the previous Disney animated features before it both with its animation and its story. And yet, it manages to equal and even top the three Disney films that came before it because it has the best balance of everything that made Disney films terrific to begin with. Even with a brief running time of just over an hour, Dumbo is more evidence that a great film which lasts just over an hour is preferable to a lousy film that lasts around two hours.

    Like 'Snow White,' this is one old Disney film that made me both cry and smile. I watched this film on a flight home from Dubai a few months ago after not having seen it since I was a child. Also as a child, I had a small cuddly toy of Dumbo that I was probably given when I was a baby. This film is rather sophisticated for its time due to its fluid animation and detailed backgrounds throughout. Pretty much all the songs are memorable. While the majority of them are uplifting (in particular 'Casey Jr' and 'Pink Elephants on Parade - their accompanying scenes also stand out very well,') the saddest one for me is 'Baby of Mine.' It made me cry when I was little and it still makes me cry now. Other than that, most of the characters are well-designed, especially Dumbo, Timothy Mouse, Dumbo's mother and the other female elephants; however I found the designs of the boys who taunted Dumbo and were beaten by his mother before she was deemed a mad elephant somewhat old-fashioned as well as the opening cards. Nevertheless, these aspects are forgivable for the film's era. The film's pace was relatively swift as well due to its length of just over an hour. Overall this is a timeless film that was worth re-visiting, albeit the tear-jerking 'Baby of Mine' sequence and a couple of old-fashioned aspects. 8/10.

    Dumbo is among the original Disney masterpieces, and masterpiece it is! My review is probably not necessary because most people have seen it by now, but I feel the need to include it because it is one of my favorite Disney Originals. Dumbo has the lovable circus characters, a funny little mouse and who can ever forget the Pink Elephants On Parade scene? I think Disney nailed this one by not making Dumbo a talking character because it makes his emotions on his face and in his actions all the more powerful. There is classic, circus-based soundtracks that add to the excitement, and of course the famous Baby Mine scene that was good enough to have been covered by many celebrities including Bette Midler. Classic family fun!

    Hands down, Dumbo will always be a Disney animation classic. The plot is rather simple, it's your basic Rudolph the Reindeer type of a story of a child who is a different to the point that makes them outcast amongst society. They get laugh at, discrimination, or mistreated. In this case, it's Dumbo's ears. It's a simple story of overcoming a difference that life threw at you and finding out how you can adapt to it. This may be a simple story but for me, it works for me and really, it's the characters that help to sell the story. Based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson, the story is about Jumbo JR who is cruelly mock to the point, that he was 'nickname' Dumbo. I love all his expressions are expressed through body language seeing as he doesn't talk but that comes from the fact that he's just a baby but even still, it works in the film and even without the dialogue, it is easy to pick up on Dumbo's emotions. His only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy (Edward Brophy). While the elephants don't like the mouse, Dumbo finds a paternal figure in him while his mother is locked up trying to protect him. While the movie loves to point out that this is a flying Elephant movie, in truth, Dumbo only flies in the last 10 minutes of the film. This is where the plot device comes into play. On his journey of self-discovery, Dumbo meets a group of Crows that teach Dumbo how to fly using a Magic Feather. It wasn't magic, as it was meant to give him a boost in courage. Now there has been a bunch of controversial about the black crows. In my opinion, I don't find it racist. The racism accusations around the crows usually centers somewhat around the fact that the leader crow is named, "Jim." It's making a joke out of the Jim Crow laws. The crow leader is the only white actor playing a crow. It's Cliff Edwards (the voice of Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio). I do like James Baskett as one of the crows. He will play Uncle Remus in Song of the South later on his career adding more to the controversial. Now as far as the crow debate goes, I never had any problems with them at all since in turn, they were integral to Dumbo's growth in the end. They were cool then and still are cool now. I guess I can see how they could be considered a bit racially insensitive, but even then it was portraying non-negative stereotypes, not negative ones. It wasn't like they were picking at watermelon slices, eating fried chicken or anything. Yes, the crows were portrayed akin to a very popular racial stereotype, "the Sambo." The Sambo is portrayed as a lazy, ignorant and enthusiastic bum. Like other racial stereotypes, such as The Mammy, the Tom and so on, they were popularized portrayals used in racist minstrel shows. The decision to name the lead crow Jim, in tandem with portraying the crows as Sambo stereotypes, makes the Crows more of an insult aimed at the civil rights movement and their efforts than innocent, plucky birds. The fact that Disney managed to disguise this racism in the form of innocent, plucky birds and marketed it makes it kind of insidious. Still, this band of crows that are cool, funny, clever and snarky. True, they start out a little cold hearted, but ultimately show to be very upright people underneath once they learn of Dumbo's plight and help him accomplish the impossible. In fact, taken in context, they're the only morally decent characters besides Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy. All the other "white" characters are portrayed as haughty, selfish, big headed, mean, ignorant, and hurtful. The gossipy elephants, the cruel circus children, the pompous ring leader, and the horrible clowns all in some way hurt or endanger Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo for self-gain. Plus, "When I See a Elephant Fly" is one of the cleverest, funniest, and catchiest songs in a Disney movie. The other good song was "Baby Mine", I have no regrets in admitting that every time the song comes on, I always cry. Despite what I may feel or whatever goes on with the family, it brings back to joy and comfort that I cry in a good way for loving my family. The only reason Dumbo's mother is in there in the first place is because she was trying to protect him, he can't really see her and they can't touch much. Add that to the song itself, then the fact that they show all the other baby animals in the circus asleep with their mother's. So yeah, Disney really know how to make a tearjerker when they want to. The other songs are pointless. The Pink Elephants on Parade scene scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid, and wasn't needed. Look Out for Mr. Stork is a catchy barber song. Still, dated and was a bit odd. If you're on birth control he won't find you. It's time for lemonade and cracker jacks Casey junior's back was bad. The animation was simplicity due to an animators strike. It was a deliberate pursuit due to that, as Pinoccohio and Fantasia were both flops at the time due to the work detail need for those films. If Dumbo wasn't a success, Disney would have closed down its studios since they lost a lot of money on those films. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. The animators wouldn't have return until the following year with Bambi. A number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns. Overall: Dumbo is emotional, atmosphere works fast paced, energetic and fun.

    Dumbo was released a year after Fantasia in 1941. This film is about a male elephant who was born with huge ears gets constantly made fun of by the other elephants in the circus, and the humans. After a boy goes too far into picking on Dumbo, his mother goes crazy, and gets locked up in a speedster place for crazy animals. Dumbo then gets put into an act where he falls a ridiculously high distance. Will he be able to shine in the circus? This film may not be as good as the previous three, it is still a good quality film. A bit on the short side, you way to know what happens next in the plot. The characters are all endearing; Dumbo has a clear personality (even though he does not talk) and you do feel sorry for him, the mouse that helps Dumbo is a cute and entertaining character. The crows are hilarious, and are definitely one of the best aspects of the movie, and the mother elephant is a typical mother who watches out for their kid. The songs are pretty good as well. "Baby Mine" is a slow, emotional, melodic tune, "When I See An Elephant Fly" is an upbeat track that makes you want to dance, and the score is very good as well. The animation is not as good as the previous 3 (because of its small budget), but it is still very interesting, and you could tell that they animated it, so it could stand out from the other films. The Pink Elephant scene is so cool. The way that they go about and move is so brilliant and is beyond words. This is ranked lower than the others because although it is a great film, it is a bit too short (a bit over an hour), and the fact that it does not leave much of an impact on you like the others do. I think that if the film was a bit longer, you would get a bit more invested into it. If you want to watch a short, entertaining family movie, Dumbo is the movie to go to.

    One of the shortest, the cheapest and simplest of Disney's animated films, Dumbo also happens to be one of the best. Stung by the fall-out from Fantasia, Disney returned to the story telling qualities that had made Pinocchio so successful. The simple story finds a baby elephant born with over sized ears who is separated from his mother when she's locked away for trying to protect him. Ostracised by his own kind and a figure of fun to the human public, Dumbo skulks away with his only friend, Timothy Q. Mouse. At the pinnacle of their adventure together, Dumbo discovers he has a talent, a talent that will change his life forever. And that's all there is to it. Only it's a picture that pulls on a myriad of emotions, it's funny, sad, exciting, and a great message movie as well. Delightful for the kids and ever watchable for adults of all ages, it's totally reliant on the animals for characterisations, where amazingly Dumbo is the one animal on show who doesn't speak! But it matters not, such is Disney when on top form, the animation is so great that just from Dumbo's expressions we know how he is feeling. Some wonderful tunes in here as well, including the quite beautiful "Baby Mine", while a surreal hallucination sequence (Pink Elephants On Parade) that plays out as Dumbo and Timothy accidentally drink liquor, is remarkable. There has been some balking at the black characterisations via some jaunty and funky crows, but they are immensely funny and for 1941 they be crafted with love and there's not a hint of being aware to racial stereotypes. Disney "A" League is Dumbo. 10/10

    Mere months before the U.S. entered World War II, Disney released its fourth major animated film, "Dumbo." At an unusually short 63 minutes, "Dumbo" tells a simple story of an elephant separated from his mother and picked on for his over-sized ears, who with the help of a circus mouse, must learn to love and believe in himself. "Dumbo" is really a short film padded by artistic sequences set to moving, Oscar-winning music. It opens with storks delivering babies to all the animals involved in a traveling circus. The kangaroo gets her baby, the tiger gets her babies and even the hippo gets her baby, but poor Mrs. Jumbo the elephant is left empty-handed. This sets the tone for the alienation both she and her soon-to-arrive child, Jumbo Jr., will experience throughout the film. When Mr. Stork (Sterling Holloway) eventually delivers Jumbo Jr., he and his mother become a laughing stock when the other lady elephants see his gigantic ears, nicknaming him "Dumbo." At one point at a circus stop, several spectators tease Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo goes mad with rage. The Ringmaster (Herman Bing) has her chained up in a train car and Dumbo is left to fend for himself Â— until he's befriended by Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy). Timothy thinks Dumbo's ears suit him well and believes he could be a star. He becomes Dumbo's life coach and only companion. The tender relationship between Dumbo and his mother (which would become a major dynamic in Disney's next film, "Bambi") is the emotional core of the film. Neither character speaks, and so the animators must focus on telling that story through the animation. At one point, a deflated Dumbo reunites with his confined mother and she cradles him in her trunk through the barred windows of the train car as the song "Baby Mine" plays, a timeless lullaby. Even Timothy sheds a tear. It's the most powerful scene in the film and testament to Disney's legacy. "Dumbo" has lots of unforgettable sequences peppered throughout that accompany the extremely basic narrative arc of how wide-eyed Dumbo gets separated from mom, feels shame and embarrassment for who he is and then accepts and believes in himself. Not all of them make sense and many are of questionable appropriateness, but they give "Dumbo" it's unique stamp among the Disney classics. "Song of the Roustabouts," for example, is a terrifying sequence in which the elephants, along with several African-American laborers, pitch the Big Top tent in the middle of a booming thunderstorm. The way light flashes and the wind whips water all about creates a fascinating mood, but the juxtaposition of circus animal labor and the presumed labor of free but unequal blacks makes it a strange scene to wedge into the beginning of the movie. "Pink Elephants on Parade" later in the movie is a visually daring and impressive sequence, but it's wildly inappropriate and arguably unnecessary. After Dumbo is made the butt of a joke in the clown act at the circus that proves successful, the clowns celebrate in their tent. Their liquor spikes the water bucket Dumbo and Timothy drink from and suddenly our main characters are having drunken hallucinations of color-changing elephants in a sequence clearly borrowing from the spirit of "Fantasia," which came out the year before. They wake up the next morning hanging from a tree, which leads Timothy to suppose Dumbo flew them up there in their drunken stupor. So, essentially, an accidental drunken episode leads to Dumbo's discovery of his amazing talent. At that point we meet the black crows, several jive-talking caricatures of African-Americans led by a character named Jim Crow (Cliff Edwards). Even if you assume the best of intentions on Disney's end, there's still a lot of insensitivity to be accounted for. At the same time, while they mock Dumbo at first, they apologize and are among few characters to be nice to him. Over time, these regrettable choices have given "Dumbo" its own unique flavor and helped it become a classic that stands on its own merits in Disney's canon, not a film that has simply been bolstered by the films made before and after it. Coming off "Fantasia" and "Pinocchio," "Dumbo" delivered the same emotional punch with less at its disposal in terms of story and visual detail. It's over in a flash, but "Dumbo" stands out with more than big ears. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com

    Dumbo (1941) **** (out of 4) One of Disney's greatest and cutest films centers on the elephant Dumbo, a small elephant with incredibly large ears. The large ears cause him to be picked on by many but with the help of his only friend, a mouse, he starts to be praised for what he can do. DUMBO is without question one of the studios greatest films and I think I'd say that it's also their very cutest. I think the characters here are among some of the best ever done for the studio and the screenplay is quite simple but it milks ever bit of emotion it can from the viewer. The most noticeable thing about watching this film today is how mean everyone in it is towards Dumbo. I'm sure most parents will be turned off by the behavior and I'm sure kids will be able to connect with Dumbo. There's no question that there's a message to be learned here and it's hard to believe that anyone could see this movie and not feel bad if they're the person picking on someone or get courage if they're the person being picked on. The story itself is quite simple and predictable but the characters from the leads to the supporting elephants to the crows are just so memorable and perfectly written. The songs here aren't quite as impressive as some of the other Disney films of this era but they're still pretty good. The animation is also quite simple but I thought this approach added for some beautiful scenes. DUMBO is clearly a film that works on so many levels and it remains one of the best of its kind.

    The classic Dumbo is a short movie about a cute little elephant who has self-image issues because of his big ears. It's a good lesson for kids everywhere - take what other people see as something bad about you and turn it into something positive. There's lots of animals in the animated movie, and we are introduced to most of them at the beginning of the movie. Storks are seen delivering babies everywhere - keeping with the old time explanation of "where do babies come from?" Other animals seen are bears, kangaroos, fish, tigers, giraffes, elephants, birds, monkeys, foxes, ostriches, snakes, horses, camels, zebras, hippos, gorillas, and even a mouse. Objects are person-fied in this movie. such as the train that talks. Animals are more like people then animals. The cut mouse who gives Dumbo his confidence, Mrs. Jumbo and her annoyingly rude companions, Mr. Stork. Comedy is written in a way that is funny for the adults as well as the children. I love when the stork is sitting on the cloud (every child imagines sitting on a cloud) and looking down on the earth at a map of the United States. The stork is constantly having to retrieve Dumbo as he sinks through the cloud. My favorite song is "When I See an Elephant Fly." Some negative elements: there is alcohol in this movie. We can see men drinking it, then later water is tainted with alcohol and the mouse and Dumbo are drunk. They have a wild vision...

    The 70th anniversary Blu-Ray of Dumbo is a must have for Disney fans and classic animation fans alike. The movie has been restored beautifully, showcasing the charming water-colored backgrounds, and the animation just pops off the screen in High-Def, like a living painting. Years ago when I seen a documentary about how Disney was using computers to clean up their classic animated films frame by frame I wasn't sure how the result would be, but the movie looks like it was just made, and not in a bad way. The sound is equally well restored, not over-blown but above and beyond most movies over 70 years old. A huge improvement over the DVD release from 2001. The movie if you are one of the few people on earth not familiar with the tale, is about a baby elephant with extremely large ears, named Jumbo Jr, but after being mocked the name "Dumbo" sticks. Despite this, with the help of his friend, a mouse, Timothy Q. Mouse, he soars above his bullies in more ways than one. Dumbo is presented in it's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and you can chose to watch it with black bars on the sides, or changing art panels that reflect each scene. There is also a Cine-Explore experience, with historians and animators taking you through the movie, a deleted scene and song, a documentary on the making of the film, a feturette called Celebrating Dumbo, and one on the ride at Disney Land, an audio commentary, a pair of classic Disney Shorts "The Flying Mouse" and "Elmer Elephant" (both in HD as are most the special features), and some games for the kids. A nice package for a classic film. RATING: MOVIE: 10 out of 10 AUDIO/VIDEO: 9 out of 10, 10 out of 10 EXTRAS: 9 out of 10

    I think it's pretty safe to say that we all have been in the same shoes as the main character of Walt Disney's 4th animated feature Dumbo (1941) at least once in our lives before. Anyone who had either seen this picture or had been picked on and/or bullied in school knows what it feels like to go through whatever the main character goes through in this film. The biggest reason why Dumbo has always been one of Disney's most timeless animated treasures is because so many of us can identify with the sadness and pain that the title character feels from all the unfortunate circumstances he's put under. Obviously, that isn't the only reason why Dumbo still holds up well after all these years, but more on that later. Our main character of this film is a baby elephant named Dumbo who is ridiculed by fellow circus animals and humans for his enormous ears. His mother Jumbo is the only elephant who is kind to Dumbo and willing to defend him. But when she gets into trouble for trying to protect Dumbo from harm, she gets locked up in a cage and Dumbo is now alone. That's when a circus mouse named Timothy Mouse comes in and becomes his only friend outside his mother. Timothy promises to do whatever he can to help Dumbo overcome his obstacle by making it into his strength. Right off the bat, I should say that I thought it was ingenious to make Dumbo's best friend a mouse, given that elephants are supposed to be afraid of mice for whatever reasons. I liked how even though sad things keep happening to Dumbo, he's the only elephant in the circus that has a mouse for a friend. That was a very clever idea on the writer's part. I also found Dumbo's relationship with his mom to be deeply touching and emotional. The filmmakers were wise to keep the dialogue out of the scenes between Dumbo and his mom and let the heartwarming images drawn by the Disney animators do the talking so to speak. Remember a brief scene early on when Jumbo wraps Dumbo's ears into a blanket and gently rocks him back and forth with her trunk? That was a cute little scene. You couldn't make this part of the movie better with dialogue since it manages to work perfectly well as it is. Speaking of great scenes, how about that infamous pink elephants sequence? Make all the arguments you like about how it contributes little to the plot and how a certain scene before it could send the wrong message to kids with Dumbo and Timothy Mouse accidentally consuming alcohol. That pink elephants scene is still a cool scene to watch. Considering the time in which it came out and all of the bright, colorful and surreal imagery being shown on screen, that scene was really ahead of its time in terms of its content. In regards to the controversy involving the crows that help Dumbo discover his true destiny and whether or not they are racist, I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about. In my opinion, they were just cool, free-spirited creatures who are just enjoying life. On top of that, the main leader of the group was voiced by a white person (Cliff Edwards to be precise, who's also famous for his voice-over work for Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio (1940)), so it makes the argument a tad less credible. Personally, nothing about these crows would've offended me if I was an African-American. If there was a scene that would have offended me if I were an African-American, it would be the Roustabouts song earlier in the film. I'm shocked that for all the controversy with the crows, how come no one seems to be offended by the Roustabouts scene? It clearly involves African-American slaves setting up the circus tents along with the circus animals. If that wasn't enough for this scene to repel any African-Americans, then some of the lyrics are. I swear I heard these very words somewhere in the songÂ… "We don't know when we get our pay, and when we do we throw our pay away". They're basically saying that they're enjoying being hard-working slaves and that they only enjoy living for that reason. I guess it just goes to show you how complicated race issues can really become, but I just think America was calling racism on the wrong part of the movie. In the tradition of the best Disney pictures, another one of the film's strengths is in its music and songs arranged by Frank Churchill, Oliver Wallace, and Ned Washington. Along with its wide range of music whether it's softer music or circus music, the film's songs are still memorable to this day especially "Casey Junior", "Baby Mine" and "When I See An Elephant Fly". The music and songs have noteworthy variety to them and they are all handled very well. The animation was intended to be a little less advanced than the three previous Disney films before it (Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia), but it's still well done in its own right. The animation compliments the simple story that is being told well enough. There's no need to remake it and advance the animation further, it somehow works just fine as it is. Dumbo was intended to be a simpler film than the previous Disney animated features before it both with its animation and its story. And yet, it manages to equal and even top the three Disney films that came before it because it has the best balance of everything that made Disney films terrific to begin with. Even with a brief running time of just over an hour, Dumbo is more evidence that a great film which lasts just over an hour is preferable to a lousy film that lasts around two hours.

    Like 'Snow White,' this is one old Disney film that made me both cry and smile. I watched this film on a flight home from Dubai a few months ago after not having seen it since I was a child. Also as a child, I had a small cuddly toy of Dumbo that I was probably given when I was a baby. This film is rather sophisticated for its time due to its fluid animation and detailed backgrounds throughout. Pretty much all the songs are memorable. While the majority of them are uplifting (in particular 'Casey Jr' and 'Pink Elephants on Parade - their accompanying scenes also stand out very well,') the saddest one for me is 'Baby of Mine.' It made me cry when I was little and it still makes me cry now. Other than that, most of the characters are well-designed, especially Dumbo, Timothy Mouse, Dumbo's mother and the other female elephants; however I found the designs of the boys who taunted Dumbo and were beaten by his mother before she was deemed a mad elephant somewhat old-fashioned as well as the opening cards. Nevertheless, these aspects are forgivable for the film's era. The film's pace was relatively swift as well due to its length of just over an hour. Overall this is a timeless film that was worth re-visiting, albeit the tear-jerking 'Baby of Mine' sequence and a couple of old-fashioned aspects. 8/10.

    Dumbo is among the original Disney masterpieces, and masterpiece it is! My review is probably not necessary because most people have seen it by now, but I feel the need to include it because it is one of my favorite Disney Originals. Dumbo has the lovable circus characters, a funny little mouse and who can ever forget the Pink Elephants On Parade scene? I think Disney nailed this one by not making Dumbo a talking character because it makes his emotions on his face and in his actions all the more powerful. There is classic, circus-based soundtracks that add to the excitement, and of course the famous Baby Mine scene that was good enough to have been covered by many celebrities including Bette Midler. Classic family fun!

    Hands down, Dumbo will always be a Disney animation classic. The plot is rather simple, it's your basic Rudolph the Reindeer type of a story of a child who is a different to the point that makes them outcast amongst society. They get laugh at, discrimination, or mistreated. In this case, it's Dumbo's ears. It's a simple story of overcoming a difference that life threw at you and finding out how you can adapt to it. This may be a simple story but for me, it works for me and really, it's the characters that help to sell the story. Based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson, the story is about Jumbo JR who is cruelly mock to the point, that he was 'nickname' Dumbo. I love all his expressions are expressed through body language seeing as he doesn't talk but that comes from the fact that he's just a baby but even still, it works in the film and even without the dialogue, it is easy to pick up on Dumbo's emotions. His only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy (Edward Brophy). While the elephants don't like the mouse, Dumbo finds a paternal figure in him while his mother is locked up trying to protect him. While the movie loves to point out that this is a flying Elephant movie, in truth, Dumbo only flies in the last 10 minutes of the film. This is where the plot device comes into play. On his journey of self-discovery, Dumbo meets a group of Crows that teach Dumbo how to fly using a Magic Feather. It wasn't magic, as it was meant to give him a boost in courage. Now there has been a bunch of controversial about the black crows. In my opinion, I don't find it racist. The racism accusations around the crows usually centers somewhat around the fact that the leader crow is named, "Jim." It's making a joke out of the Jim Crow laws. The crow leader is the only white actor playing a crow. It's Cliff Edwards (the voice of Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio). I do like James Baskett as one of the crows. He will play Uncle Remus in Song of the South later on his career adding more to the controversial. Now as far as the crow debate goes, I never had any problems with them at all since in turn, they were integral to Dumbo's growth in the end. They were cool then and still are cool now. I guess I can see how they could be considered a bit racially insensitive, but even then it was portraying non-negative stereotypes, not negative ones. It wasn't like they were picking at watermelon slices, eating fried chicken or anything. Yes, the crows were portrayed akin to a very popular racial stereotype, "the Sambo." The Sambo is portrayed as a lazy, ignorant and enthusiastic bum. Like other racial stereotypes, such as The Mammy, the Tom and so on, they were popularized portrayals used in racist minstrel shows. The decision to name the lead crow Jim, in tandem with portraying the crows as Sambo stereotypes, makes the Crows more of an insult aimed at the civil rights movement and their efforts than innocent, plucky birds. The fact that Disney managed to disguise this racism in the form of innocent, plucky birds and marketed it makes it kind of insidious. Still, this band of crows that are cool, funny, clever and snarky. True, they start out a little cold hearted, but ultimately show to be very upright people underneath once they learn of Dumbo's plight and help him accomplish the impossible. In fact, taken in context, they're the only morally decent characters besides Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy. All the other "white" characters are portrayed as haughty, selfish, big headed, mean, ignorant, and hurtful. The gossipy elephants, the cruel circus children, the pompous ring leader, and the horrible clowns all in some way hurt or endanger Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo for self-gain. Plus, "When I See a Elephant Fly" is one of the cleverest, funniest, and catchiest songs in a Disney movie. The other good song was "Baby Mine", I have no regrets in admitting that every time the song comes on, I always cry. Despite what I may feel or whatever goes on with the family, it brings back to joy and comfort that I cry in a good way for loving my family. The only reason Dumbo's mother is in there in the first place is because she was trying to protect him, he can't really see her and they can't touch much. Add that to the song itself, then the fact that they show all the other baby animals in the circus asleep with their mother's. So yeah, Disney really know how to make a tearjerker when they want to. The other songs are pointless. The Pink Elephants on Parade scene scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid, and wasn't needed. Look Out for Mr. Stork is a catchy barber song. Still, dated and was a bit odd. If you're on birth control he won't find you. It's time for lemonade and cracker jacks Casey junior's back was bad. The animation was simplicity due to an animators strike. It was a deliberate pursuit due to that, as Pinoccohio and Fantasia were both flops at the time due to the work detail need for those films. If Dumbo wasn't a success, Disney would have closed down its studios since they lost a lot of money on those films. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. The animators wouldn't have return until the following year with Bambi. A number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns. Overall: Dumbo is emotional, atmosphere works fast paced, energetic and fun.

    Dumbo was released a year after Fantasia in 1941. This film is about a male elephant who was born with huge ears gets constantly made fun of by the other elephants in the circus, and the humans. After a boy goes too far into picking on Dumbo, his mother goes crazy, and gets locked up in a speedster place for crazy animals. Dumbo then gets put into an act where he falls a ridiculously high distance. Will he be able to shine in the circus? This film may not be as good as the previous three, it is still a good quality film. A bit on the short side, you way to know what happens next in the plot. The characters are all endearing; Dumbo has a clear personality (even though he does not talk) and you do feel sorry for him, the mouse that helps Dumbo is a cute and entertaining character. The crows are hilarious, and are definitely one of the best aspects of the movie, and the mother elephant is a typical mother who watches out for their kid. The songs are pretty good as well. "Baby Mine" is a slow, emotional, melodic tune, "When I See An Elephant Fly" is an upbeat track that makes you want to dance, and the score is very good as well. The animation is not as good as the previous 3 (because of its small budget), but it is still very interesting, and you could tell that they animated it, so it could stand out from the other films. The Pink Elephant scene is so cool. The way that they go about and move is so brilliant and is beyond words. This is ranked lower than the others because although it is a great film, it is a bit too short (a bit over an hour), and the fact that it does not leave much of an impact on you like the others do. I think that if the film was a bit longer, you would get a bit more invested into it. If you want to watch a short, entertaining family movie, Dumbo is the movie to go to.

    One of the shortest, the cheapest and simplest of Disney's animated films, Dumbo also happens to be one of the best. Stung by the fall-out from Fantasia, Disney returned to the story telling qualities that had made Pinocchio so successful. The simple story finds a baby elephant born with over sized ears who is separated from his mother when she's locked away for trying to protect him. Ostracised by his own kind and a figure of fun to the human public, Dumbo skulks away with his only friend, Timothy Q. Mouse. At the pinnacle of their adventure together, Dumbo discovers he has a talent, a talent that will change his life forever. And that's all there is to it. Only it's a picture that pulls on a myriad of emotions, it's funny, sad, exciting, and a great message movie as well. Delightful for the kids and ever watchable for adults of all ages, it's totally reliant on the animals for characterisations, where amazingly Dumbo is the one animal on show who doesn't speak! But it matters not, such is Disney when on top form, the animation is so great that just from Dumbo's expressions we know how he is feeling. Some wonderful tunes in here as well, including the quite beautiful "Baby Mine", while a surreal hallucination sequence (Pink Elephants On Parade) that plays out as Dumbo and Timothy accidentally drink liquor, is remarkable. There has been some balking at the black characterisations via some jaunty and funky crows, but they are immensely funny and for 1941 they be crafted with love and there's not a hint of being aware to racial stereotypes. Disney "A" League is Dumbo. 10/10

    Mere months before the U.S. entered World War II, Disney released its fourth major animated film, "Dumbo." At an unusually short 63 minutes, "Dumbo" tells a simple story of an elephant separated from his mother and picked on for his over-sized ears, who with the help of a circus mouse, must learn to love and believe in himself. "Dumbo" is really a short film padded by artistic sequences set to moving, Oscar-winning music. It opens with storks delivering babies to all the animals involved in a traveling circus. The kangaroo gets her baby, the tiger gets her babies and even the hippo gets her baby, but poor Mrs. Jumbo the elephant is left empty-handed. This sets the tone for the alienation both she and her soon-to-arrive child, Jumbo Jr., will experience throughout the film. When Mr. Stork (Sterling Holloway) eventually delivers Jumbo Jr., he and his mother become a laughing stock when the other lady elephants see his gigantic ears, nicknaming him "Dumbo." At one point at a circus stop, several spectators tease Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo goes mad with rage. The Ringmaster (Herman Bing) has her chained up in a train car and Dumbo is left to fend for himself Â— until he's befriended by Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy). Timothy thinks Dumbo's ears suit him well and believes he could be a star. He becomes Dumbo's life coach and only companion. The tender relationship between Dumbo and his mother (which would become a major dynamic in Disney's next film, "Bambi") is the emotional core of the film. Neither character speaks, and so the animators must focus on telling that story through the animation. At one point, a deflated Dumbo reunites with his confined mother and she cradles him in her trunk through the barred windows of the train car as the song "Baby Mine" plays, a timeless lullaby. Even Timothy sheds a tear. It's the most powerful scene in the film and testament to Disney's legacy. "Dumbo" has lots of unforgettable sequences peppered throughout that accompany the extremely basic narrative arc of how wide-eyed Dumbo gets separated from mom, feels shame and embarrassment for who he is and then accepts and believes in himself. Not all of them make sense and many are of questionable appropriateness, but they give "Dumbo" it's unique stamp among the Disney classics. "Song of the Roustabouts," for example, is a terrifying sequence in which the elephants, along with several African-American laborers, pitch the Big Top tent in the middle of a booming thunderstorm. The way light flashes and the wind whips water all about creates a fascinating mood, but the juxtaposition of circus animal labor and the presumed labor of free but unequal blacks makes it a strange scene to wedge into the beginning of the movie. "Pink Elephants on Parade" later in the movie is a visually daring and impressive sequence, but it's wildly inappropriate and arguably unnecessary. After Dumbo is made the butt of a joke in the clown act at the circus that proves successful, the clowns celebrate in their tent. Their liquor spikes the water bucket Dumbo and Timothy drink from and suddenly our main characters are having drunken hallucinations of color-changing elephants in a sequence clearly borrowing from the spirit of "Fantasia," which came out the year before. They wake up the next morning hanging from a tree, which leads Timothy to suppose Dumbo flew them up there in their drunken stupor. So, essentially, an accidental drunken episode leads to Dumbo's discovery of his amazing talent. At that point we meet the black crows, several jive-talking caricatures of African-Americans led by a character named Jim Crow (Cliff Edwards). Even if you assume the best of intentions on Disney's end, there's still a lot of insensitivity to be accounted for. At the same time, while they mock Dumbo at first, they apologize and are among few characters to be nice to him. Over time, these regrettable choices have given "Dumbo" its own unique flavor and helped it become a classic that stands on its own merits in Disney's canon, not a film that has simply been bolstered by the films made before and after it. Coming off "Fantasia" and "Pinocchio," "Dumbo" delivered the same emotional punch with less at its disposal in terms of story and visual detail. It's over in a flash, but "Dumbo" stands out with more than big ears. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com

    Dumbo (1941) **** (out of 4) One of Disney's greatest and cutest films centers on the elephant Dumbo, a small elephant with incredibly large ears. The large ears cause him to be picked on by many but with the help of his only friend, a mouse, he starts to be praised for what he can do. DUMBO is without question one of the studios greatest films and I think I'd say that it's also their very cutest. I think the characters here are among some of the best ever done for the studio and the screenplay is quite simple but it milks ever bit of emotion it can from the viewer. The most noticeable thing about watching this film today is how mean everyone in it is towards Dumbo. I'm sure most parents will be turned off by the behavior and I'm sure kids will be able to connect with Dumbo. There's no question that there's a message to be learned here and it's hard to believe that anyone could see this movie and not feel bad if they're the person picking on someone or get courage if they're the person being picked on. The story itself is quite simple and predictable but the characters from the leads to the supporting elephants to the crows are just so memorable and perfectly written. The songs here aren't quite as impressive as some of the other Disney films of this era but they're still pretty good. The animation is also quite simple but I thought this approach added for some beautiful scenes. DUMBO is clearly a film that works on so many levels and it remains one of the best of its kind.

    The classic Dumbo is a short movie about a cute little elephant who has self-image issues because of his big ears. It's a good lesson for kids everywhere - take what other people see as something bad about you and turn it into something positive. There's lots of animals in the animated movie, and we are introduced to most of them at the beginning of the movie. Storks are seen delivering babies everywhere - keeping with the old time explanation of "where do babies come from?" Other animals seen are bears, kangaroos, fish, tigers, giraffes, elephants, birds, monkeys, foxes, ostriches, snakes, horses, camels, zebras, hippos, gorillas, and even a mouse. Objects are person-fied in this movie. such as the train that talks. Animals are more like people then animals. The cut mouse who gives Dumbo his confidence, Mrs. Jumbo and her annoyingly rude companions, Mr. Stork. Comedy is written in a way that is funny for the adults as well as the children. I love when the stork is sitting on the cloud (every child imagines sitting on a cloud) and looking down on the earth at a map of the United States. The stork is constantly having to retrieve Dumbo as he sinks through the cloud. My favorite song is "When I See an Elephant Fly." Some negative elements: there is alcohol in this movie. We can see men drinking it, then later water is tainted with alcohol and the mouse and Dumbo are drunk. They have a wild vision...

    The 70th anniversary Blu-Ray of Dumbo is a must have for Disney fans and classic animation fans alike. The movie has been restored beautifully, showcasing the charming water-colored backgrounds, and the animation just pops off the screen in High-Def, like a living painting. Years ago when I seen a documentary about how Disney was using computers to clean up their classic animated films frame by frame I wasn't sure how the result would be, but the movie looks like it was just made, and not in a bad way. The sound is equally well restored, not over-blown but above and beyond most movies over 70 years old. A huge improvement over the DVD release from 2001. The movie if you are one of the few people on earth not familiar with the tale, is about a baby elephant with extremely large ears, named Jumbo Jr, but after being mocked the name "Dumbo" sticks. Despite this, with the help of his friend, a mouse, Timothy Q. Mouse, he soars above his bullies in more ways than one. Dumbo is presented in it's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and you can chose to watch it with black bars on the sides, or changing art panels that reflect each scene. There is also a Cine-Explore experience, with historians and animators taking you through the movie, a deleted scene and song, a documentary on the making of the film, a feturette called Celebrating Dumbo, and one on the ride at Disney Land, an audio commentary, a pair of classic Disney Shorts "The Flying Mouse" and "Elmer Elephant" (both in HD as are most the special features), and some games for the kids. A nice package for a classic film. RATING: MOVIE: 10 out of 10 AUDIO/VIDEO: 9 out of 10, 10 out of 10 EXTRAS: 9 out of 10

    I think it's pretty safe to say that we all have been in the same shoes as the main character of Walt Disney's 4th animated feature Dumbo (1941) at least once in our lives before. Anyone who had either seen this picture or had been picked on and/or bullied in school knows what it feels like to go through whatever the main character goes through in this film. The biggest reason why Dumbo has always been one of Disney's most timeless animated treasures is because so many of us can identify with the sadness and pain that the title character feels from all the unfortunate circumstances he's put under. Obviously, that isn't the only reason why Dumbo still holds up well after all these years, but more on that later. Our main character of this film is a baby elephant named Dumbo who is ridiculed by fellow circus animals and humans for his enormous ears. His mother Jumbo is the only elephant who is kind to Dumbo and willing to defend him. But when she gets into trouble for trying to protect Dumbo from harm, she gets locked up in a cage and Dumbo is now alone. That's when a circus mouse named Timothy Mouse comes in and becomes his only friend outside his mother. Timothy promises to do whatever he can to help Dumbo overcome his obstacle by making it into his strength. Right off the bat, I should say that I thought it was ingenious to make Dumbo's best friend a mouse, given that elephants are supposed to be afraid of mice for whatever reasons. I liked how even though sad things keep happening to Dumbo, he's the only elephant in the circus that has a mouse for a friend. That was a very clever idea on the writer's part. I also found Dumbo's relationship with his mom to be deeply touching and emotional. The filmmakers were wise to keep the dialogue out of the scenes between Dumbo and his mom and let the heartwarming images drawn by the Disney animators do the talking so to speak. Remember a brief scene early on when Jumbo wraps Dumbo's ears into a blanket and gently rocks him back and forth with her trunk? That was a cute little scene. You couldn't make this part of the movie better with dialogue since it manages to work perfectly well as it is. Speaking of great scenes, how about that infamous pink elephants sequence? Make all the arguments you like about how it contributes little to the plot and how a certain scene before it could send the wrong message to kids with Dumbo and Timothy Mouse accidentally consuming alcohol. That pink elephants scene is still a cool scene to watch. Considering the time in which it came out and all of the bright, colorful and surreal imagery being shown on screen, that scene was really ahead of its time in terms of its content. In regards to the controversy involving the crows that help Dumbo discover his true destiny and whether or not they are racist, I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about. In my opinion, they were just cool, free-spirited creatures who are just enjoying life. On top of that, the main leader of the group was voiced by a white person (Cliff Edwards to be precise, who's also famous for his voice-over work for Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio (1940)), so it makes the argument a tad less credible. Personally, nothing about these crows would've offended me if I was an African-American. If there was a scene that would have offended me if I were an African-American, it would be the Roustabouts song earlier in the film. I'm shocked that for all the controversy with the crows, how come no one seems to be offended by the Roustabouts scene? It clearly involves African-American slaves setting up the circus tents along with the circus animals. If that wasn't enough for this scene to repel any African-Americans, then some of the lyrics are. I swear I heard these very words somewhere in the songÂ… "We don't know when we get our pay, and when we do we throw our pay away". They're basically saying that they're enjoying being hard-working slaves and that they only enjoy living for that reason. I guess it just goes to show you how complicated race issues can really become, but I just think America was calling racism on the wrong part of the movie. In the tradition of the best Disney pictures, another one of the film's strengths is in its music and songs arranged by Frank Churchill, Oliver Wallace, and Ned Washington. Along with its wide range of music whether it's softer music or circus music, the film's songs are still memorable to this day especially "Casey Junior", "Baby Mine" and "When I See An Elephant Fly". The music and songs have noteworthy variety to them and they are all handled very well. The animation was intended to be a little less advanced than the three previous Disney films before it (Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia), but it's still well done in its own right. The animation compliments the simple story that is being told well enough. There's no need to remake it and advance the animation further, it somehow works just fine as it is. Dumbo was intended to be a simpler film than the previous Disney animated features before it both with its animation and its story. And yet, it manages to equal and even top the three Disney films that came before it because it has the best balance of everything that made Disney films terrific to begin with. Even with a brief running time of just over an hour, Dumbo is more evidence that a great film which lasts just over an hour is preferable to a lousy film that lasts around two hours.

    Like 'Snow White,' this is one old Disney film that made me both cry and smile. I watched this film on a flight home from Dubai a few months ago after not having seen it since I was a child. Also as a child, I had a small cuddly toy of Dumbo that I was probably given when I was a baby. This film is rather sophisticated for its time due to its fluid animation and detailed backgrounds throughout. Pretty much all the songs are memorable. While the majority of them are uplifting (in particular 'Casey Jr' and 'Pink Elephants on Parade - their accompanying scenes also stand out very well,') the saddest one for me is 'Baby of Mine.' It made me cry when I was little and it still makes me cry now. Other than that, most of the characters are well-designed, especially Dumbo, Timothy Mouse, Dumbo's mother and the other female elephants; however I found the designs of the boys who taunted Dumbo and were beaten by his mother before she was deemed a mad elephant somewhat old-fashioned as well as the opening cards. Nevertheless, these aspects are forgivable for the film's era. The film's pace was relatively swift as well due to its length of just over an hour. Overall this is a timeless film that was worth re-visiting, albeit the tear-jerking 'Baby of Mine' sequence and a couple of old-fashioned aspects. 8/10.

    Dumbo is among the original Disney masterpieces, and masterpiece it is! My review is probably not necessary because most people have seen it by now, but I feel the need to include it because it is one of my favorite Disney Originals. Dumbo has the lovable circus characters, a funny little mouse and who can ever forget the Pink Elephants On Parade scene? I think Disney nailed this one by not making Dumbo a talking character because it makes his emotions on his face and in his actions all the more powerful. There is classic, circus-based soundtracks that add to the excitement, and of course the famous Baby Mine scene that was good enough to have been covered by many celebrities including Bette Midler.

    Hands down, Dumbo will always be a Disney animation classic. The plot is rather simple, it's your basic Rudolph the Reindeer type of a story of a child who is a different to the point that makes them outcast amongst society. They get laugh at, discrimination, or mistreated. In this case, it's Dumbo's ears. It's a simple story of overcoming a difference that life threw at you and finding out how you can adapt to it. This may be a simple story but for me, it works for me and really, it's the characters that help to sell the story. Based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson, the story is about Jumbo JR who is cruelly mock to the point, that he was 'nickname' Dumbo. I love all his expressions are expressed through body language seeing as he doesn't talk but that comes from the fact that he's just a baby but even still, it works in the film and even without the dialogue, it is easy to pick up on Dumbo's emotions. His only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy (Edward Brophy). While the elephants don't like the mouse, Dumbo finds a paternal figure in him while his mother is locked up trying to protect him. While the movie loves to point out that this is a flying Elephant movie, in truth, Dumbo only flies in the last 10 minutes of the film. This is where the plot device comes into play. On his journey of self-discovery, Dumbo meets a group of Crows that teach Dumbo how to fly using a Magic Feather. It wasn't magic, as it was meant to give him a boost in courage. Now there has been a bunch of controversial about the black crows. In my opinion, I don't find it racist. The racism accusations around the crows usually centers somewhat around the fact that the leader crow is named, "Jim." It's making a joke out of the Jim Crow laws. The crow leader is the only white actor playing a crow. It's Cliff Edwards (the voice of Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio). I do like James Baskett as one of the crows. He will play Uncle Remus in Song of the South later on his career adding more to the controversial. Now as far as the crow debate goes, I never had any problems with them at all since in turn, they were integral to Dumbo's growth in the end. They were cool then and still are cool now. I guess I can see how they could be considered a bit racially insensitive, but even then it was portraying non-negative stereotypes, not negative ones. It wasn't like they were picking at watermelon slices, eating fried chicken or anything. Yes, the crows were portrayed akin to a very popular racial stereotype, "the Sambo." The Sambo is portrayed as a lazy, ignorant and enthusiastic bum. Like other racial stereotypes, such as The Mammy, the Tom and so on, they were popularized portrayals used in racist minstrel shows. The decision to name the lead crow Jim, in tandem with portraying the crows as Sambo stereotypes, makes the Crows more of an insult aimed at the civil rights movement and their efforts than innocent, plucky birds. The fact that Disney managed to disguise this racism in the form of innocent, plucky birds and marketed it makes it kind of insidious. Still, this band of crows that are cool, funny, clever and snarky. True, they start out a little cold hearted, but ultimately show to be very upright people underneath once they learn of Dumbo's plight and help him accomplish the impossible. In fact, taken in context, they're the only morally decent characters besides Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy. All the other "white" characters are portrayed as haughty, selfish, big headed, mean, ignorant, and hurtful. The gossipy elephants, the cruel circus children, the pompous ring leader, and the horrible clowns all in some way hurt or endanger Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo for self-gain. Plus, "When I See a Elephant Fly" is one of the cleverest, funniest, and catchiest songs in a Disney movie. The other good song was "Baby Mine", I have no regrets in admitting that every time the song comes on, I always cry. Despite what I may feel or whatever goes on with the family, it brings back to joy and comfort that I cry in a good way for loving my family. The only reason Dumbo's mother is in there in the first place is because she was trying to protect him, he can't really see her and they can't touch much. Add that to the song itself, then the fact that they show all the other baby animals in the circus asleep with their mother's. So yeah, Disney really know how to make a tearjerker when they want to. The other songs are pointless. The Pink Elephants on Parade scene scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid, and wasn't needed. Look Out for Mr. Stork is a catchy barber song. Still, dated and was a bit odd. If you're on birth control he won't find you. It's time for lemonade and cracker jacks Casey junior's back was bad. The animation was simplicity due to an animators strike. It was a deliberate pursuit due to that, as Pinoccohio and Fantasia were both flops at the time due to the work detail need for those films. If Dumbo wasn't a success, Disney would have closed down its studios since they lost a lot of money on those films. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. The animators wouldn't have return until the following year with Bambi. A number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns. Overall: Dumbo is emotional, atmosphere works fast paced, energetic and fun.

    Dumbo was released a year after Fantasia in 1941. This film is about a male elephant who was born with huge ears gets constantly made fun of by the other elephants in the circus, and the humans. After a boy goes too far into picking on Dumbo, his mother goes crazy, and gets locked up in a speedster place for crazy animals. Dumbo then gets put into an act where he falls a ridiculously high distance. Will he be able to shine in the circus? This film may not be as good as the previous three, it is still a good quality film. A bit on the short side, you way to know what happens next in the plot. The characters are all endearing; Dumbo has a clear personality (even though he does not talk) and you do feel sorry for him, the mouse that helps Dumbo is a cute and entertaining character. The crows are hilarious, and are definitely one of the best aspects of the movie, and the mother elephant is a typical mother who watches out for their kid. The songs are pretty good as well. "Baby Mine" is a slow, emotional, melodic tune, "When I See An Elephant Fly" is an upbeat track that makes you want to dance, and the score is very good as well. The animation is not as good as the previous 3 (because of its small budget), but it is still very interesting, and you could tell that they animated it, so it could stand out from the other films. The Pink Elephant scene is so cool. The way that they go about and move is so brilliant and is beyond words. This is ranked lower than the others because although it is a great film, it is a bit too short (a bit over an hour), and the fact that it does not leave much of an impact on you like the others do. I think that if the film was a bit longer, you would get a bit more invested into it. If you want to watch a short, entertaining family movie, Dumbo is the movie to go to.

    One of the shortest, the cheapest and simplest of Disney's animated films, Dumbo also happens to be one of the best. Stung by the fall-out from Fantasia, Disney returned to the story telling qualities that had made Pinocchio so successful. The simple story finds a baby elephant born with over sized ears who is separated from his mother when she's locked away for trying to protect him. Ostracised by his own kind and a figure of fun to the human public, Dumbo skulks away with his only friend, Timothy Q. Mouse. At the pinnacle of their adventure together, Dumbo discovers he has a talent, a talent that will change his life forever. And that's all there is to it. Only it's a picture that pulls on a myriad of emotions, it's funny, sad, exciting, and a great message movie as well. Delightful for the kids and ever watchable for adults of all ages, it's totally reliant on the animals for characterisations, where amazingly Dumbo is the one animal on show who doesn't speak! But it matters not, such is Disney when on top form, the animation is so great that just from Dumbo's expressions we know how he is feeling. Some wonderful tunes in here as well, including the quite beautiful "Baby Mine", while a surreal hallucination sequence (Pink Elephants On Parade) that plays out as Dumbo and Timothy accidentally drink liquor, is remarkable. There has been some balking at the black characterisations via some jaunty and funky crows, but they are immensely funny and for 1941 they be crafted with love and there's not a hint of being aware to racial stereotypes. Disney "A" League is Dumbo. 10/10

    Mere months before the U.S. entered World War II, Disney released its fourth major animated film, "Dumbo." At an unusually short 63 minutes, "Dumbo" tells a simple story of an elephant separated from his mother and picked on for his over-sized ears, who with the help of a circus mouse, must learn to love and believe in himself. "Dumbo" is really a short film padded by artistic sequences set to moving, Oscar-winning music. It opens with storks delivering babies to all the animals involved in a traveling circus. The kangaroo gets her baby, the tiger gets her babies and even the hippo gets her baby, but poor Mrs. Jumbo the elephant is left empty-handed. This sets the tone for the alienation both she and her soon-to-arrive child, Jumbo Jr., will experience throughout the film. When Mr. Stork (Sterling Holloway) eventually delivers Jumbo Jr., he and his mother become a laughing stock when the other lady elephants see his gigantic ears, nicknaming him "Dumbo." At one point at a circus stop, several spectators tease Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo goes mad with rage. The Ringmaster (Herman Bing) has her chained up in a train car and Dumbo is left to fend for himself Â— until he's befriended by Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy). Timothy thinks Dumbo's ears suit him well and believes he could be a star. He becomes Dumbo's life coach and only companion. The tender relationship between Dumbo and his mother (which would become a major dynamic in Disney's next film, "Bambi") is the emotional core of the film. Neither character speaks, and so the animators must focus on telling that story through the animation. At one point, a deflated Dumbo reunites with his confined mother and she cradles him in her trunk through the barred windows of the train car as the song "Baby Mine" plays, a timeless lullaby. Even Timothy sheds a tear. It's the most powerful scene in the film and testament to Disney's legacy. "Dumbo" has lots of unforgettable sequences peppered throughout that accompany the extremely basic narrative arc of how wide-eyed Dumbo gets separated from mom, feels shame and embarrassment for who he is and then accepts and believes in himself. Not all of them make sense and many are of questionable appropriateness, but they give "Dumbo" it's unique stamp among the Disney classics. "Song of the Roustabouts," for example, is a terrifying sequence in which the elephants, along with several African-American laborers, pitch the Big Top tent in the middle of a booming thunderstorm. The way light flashes and the wind whips water all about creates a fascinating mood, but the juxtaposition of circus animal labor and the presumed labor of free but unequal blacks makes it a strange scene to wedge into the beginning of the movie. "Pink Elephants on Parade" later in the movie is a visually daring and impressive sequence, but it's wildly inappropriate and arguably unnecessary. After Dumbo is made the butt of a joke in the clown act at the circus that proves successful, the clowns celebrate in their tent. Their liquor spikes the water bucket Dumbo and Timothy drink from and suddenly our main characters are having drunken hallucinations of color-changing elephants in a sequence clearly borrowing from the spirit of "Fantasia," which came out the year before. They wake up the next morning hanging from a tree, which leads Timothy to suppose Dumbo flew them up there in their drunken stupor. So, essentially, an accidental drunken episode leads to Dumbo's discovery of his amazing talent. At that point we meet the black crows, several jive-talking caricatures of African-Americans led by a character named Jim Crow (Cliff Edwards). Even if you assume the best of intentions on Disney's end, there's still a lot of insensitivity to be accounted for. At the same time, while they mock Dumbo at first, they apologize and are among few characters to be nice to him. Over time, these regrettable choices have given "Dumbo" its own unique flavor and helped it become a classic that stands on its own merits in Disney's canon, not a film that has simply been bolstered by the films made before and after it. Coming off "Fantasia" and "Pinocchio," "Dumbo" delivered the same emotional punch with less at its disposal in terms of story and visual detail. It's over in a flash, but "Dumbo" stands out with more than big ears. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com

    Dumbo (1941) **** (out of 4) One of Disney's greatest and cutest films centers on the elephant Dumbo, a small elephant with incredibly large ears. The large ears cause him to be picked on by many but with the help of his only friend, a mouse, he starts to be praised for what he can do. DUMBO is without question one of the studios greatest films and I think I'd say that it's also their very cutest. I think the characters here are among some of the best ever done for the studio and the screenplay is quite simple but it milks ever bit of emotion it can from the viewer. The most noticeable thing about watching this film today is how mean everyone in it is towards Dumbo. I'm sure most parents will be turned off by the behavior and I'm sure kids will be able to connect with Dumbo. There's no question that there's a message to be learned here and it's hard to believe that anyone could see this movie and not feel bad if they're the person picking on someone or get courage if they're the person being picked on. The story itself is quite simple and predictable but the characters from the leads to the supporting elephants to the crows are just so memorable and perfectly written. The songs here aren't quite as impressive as some of the other Disney films of this era but they're still pretty good. The animation is also quite simple but I thought this approach added for some beautiful scenes. DUMBO is clearly a film that works on so many levels and it remains one of the best of its kind.

    The classic Dumbo is a short movie about a cute little elephant who has self-image issues because of his big ears. It's a good lesson for kids everywhere - take what other people see as something bad about you and turn it into something positive. There's lots of animals in the animated movie, and we are introduced to most of them at the beginning of the movie. Storks are seen delivering babies everywhere - keeping with the old time explanation of "where do babies come from?" Other animals seen are bears, kangaroos, fish, tigers, giraffes, elephants, birds, monkeys, foxes, ostriches, snakes, horses, camels, zebras, hippos, gorillas, and even a mouse. Objects are person-fied in this movie. such as the train that talks. Animals are more like people then animals. The cut mouse who gives Dumbo his confidence, Mrs. Jumbo and her annoyingly rude companions, Mr. Stork. Comedy is written in a way that is funny for the adults as well as the children. I love when the stork is sitting on the cloud (every child imagines sitting on a cloud) and looking down on the earth at a map of the United States. The stork is constantly having to retrieve Dumbo as he sinks through the cloud. My favorite song is "When I See an Elephant Fly." Some negative elements: there is alcohol in this movie. We can see men drinking it, then later water is tainted with alcohol and the mouse and Dumbo are drunk. They have a wild vision...

    The 70th anniversary Blu-Ray of Dumbo is a must have for Disney fans and classic animation fans alike. The movie has been restored beautifully, showcasing the charming water-colored backgrounds, and the animation just pops off the screen in High-Def, like a living painting. Years ago when I seen a documentary about how Disney was using computers to clean up their classic animated films frame by frame I wasn't sure how the result would be, but the movie looks like it was just made, and not in a bad way. The sound is equally well restored, not over-blown but above and beyond most movies over 70 years old. A huge improvement over the DVD release from 2001. The movie if you are one of the few people on earth not familiar with the tale, is about a baby elephant with extremely large ears, named Jumbo Jr, but after being mocked the name "Dumbo" sticks. Despite this, with the help of his friend, a mouse, Timothy Q. Mouse, he soars above his bullies in more ways than one. Dumbo is presented in it's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and you can chose to watch it with black bars on the sides, or changing art panels that reflect each scene. There is also a Cine-Explore experience, with historians and animators taking you through the movie, a deleted scene and song, a documentary on the making of the film, a feturette called Celebrating Dumbo, and one on the ride at Disney Land, an audio commentary, a pair of classic Disney Shorts "The Flying Mouse" and "Elmer Elephant" (both in HD as are most the special features), and some games for the kids. A nice package for a classic film. RATING: MOVIE: 10 out of 10 AUDIO/VIDEO: 9 out of 10, 10 out of 10 EXTRAS: 9 out of 10

    I think it's pretty safe to say that we all have been in the same shoes as the main character of Walt Disney's 4th animated feature Dumbo (1941) at least once in our lives before. Anyone who had either seen this picture or had been picked on and/or bullied in school knows what it feels like to go through whatever the main character goes through in this film. The biggest reason why Dumbo has always been one of Disney's most timeless animated treasures is because so many of us can identify with the sadness and pain that the title character feels from all the unfortunate circumstances he's put under. Obviously, that isn't the only reason why Dumbo still holds up well after all these years, but more on that later. Our main character of this film is a baby elephant named Dumbo who is ridiculed by fellow circus animals and humans for his enormous ears. His mother Jumbo is the only elephant who is kind to Dumbo and willing to defend him. But when she gets into trouble for trying to protect Dumbo from harm, she gets locked up in a cage and Dumbo is now alone. That's when a circus mouse named Timothy Mouse comes in and becomes his only friend outside his mother. Timothy promises to do whatever he can to help Dumbo overcome his obstacle by making it into his strength. Right off the bat, I should say that I thought it was ingenious to make Dumbo's best friend a mouse, given that elephants are supposed to be afraid of mice for whatever reasons. I liked how even though sad things keep happening to Dumbo, he's the only elephant in the circus that has a mouse for a friend. That was a very clever idea on the writer's part. I also found Dumbo's relationship with his mom to be deeply touching and emotional. The filmmakers were wise to keep the dialogue out of the scenes between Dumbo and his mom and let the heartwarming images drawn by the Disney animators do the talking so to speak. Remember a brief scene early on when Jumbo wraps Dumbo's ears into a blanket and gently rocks him back and forth with her trunk? That was a cute little scene. You couldn't make this part of the movie better with dialogue since it manages to work perfectly well as it is. Speaking of great scenes, how about that infamous pink elephants sequence? Make all the arguments you like about how it contributes little to the plot and how a certain scene before it could send the wrong message to kids with Dumbo and Timothy Mouse accidentally consuming alcohol. That pink elephants scene is still a cool scene to watch. Considering the time in which it came out and all of the bright, colorful and surreal imagery being shown on screen, that scene was really ahead of its time in terms of its content. In regards to the controversy involving the crows that help Dumbo discover his true destiny and whether or not they are racist, I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about. In my opinion, they were just cool, free-spirited creatures who are just enjoying life. On top of that, the main leader of the group was voiced by a white person (Cliff Edwards to be precise, who's also famous for his voice-over work for Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio (1940)), so it makes the argument a tad less credible. Personally, nothing about these crows would've offended me if I was an African-American. If there was a scene that would have offended me if I were an African-American, it would be the Roustabouts song earlier in the film. I'm shocked that for all the controversy with the crows, how come no one seems to be offended by the Roustabouts scene? It clearly involves African-American slaves setting up the circus tents along with the circus animals. If that wasn't enough for this scene to repel any African-Americans, then some of the lyrics are. I swear I heard these very words somewhere in the songÂ… "We don't know when we get our pay, and when we do we throw our pay away". They're basically saying that they're enjoying being hard-working slaves and that they only enjoy living for that reason. I guess it just goes to show you how complicated race issues can really become, but I just think America was calling racism on the wrong part of the movie. In the tradition of the best Disney pictures, another one of the film's strengths is in its music and songs arranged by Frank Churchill, Oliver Wallace, and Ned Washington. Along with its wide range of music whether it's softer music or circus music, the film's songs are still memorable to this day especially "Casey Junior", "Baby Mine" and "When I See An Elephant Fly". The music and songs have noteworthy variety to them and they are all handled very well. The animation was intended to be a little less advanced than the three previous Disney films before it (Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia), but it's still well done in its own right. The animation compliments the simple story that is being told well enough. There's no need to remake it and advance the animation further, it somehow works just fine as it is. Dumbo was intended to be a simpler film than the previous Disney animated features before it both with its animation and its story. And yet, it manages to equal and even top the three Disney films that came before it because it has the best balance of everything that made Disney films terrific to begin with. Even with a brief running time of just over an hour, Dumbo is more evidence that a great film which lasts just over an hour is preferable to a lousy film that lasts around two hours.

    Like 'Snow White,' this is one old Disney film that made me both cry and smile. I watched this film on a flight home from Dubai a few months ago after not having seen it since I was a child. Also as a child, I had a small cuddly toy of Dumbo that I was probably given when I was a baby. This film is rather sophisticated for its time due to its fluid animation and detailed backgrounds throughout. Pretty much all the songs are memorable. While the majority of them are uplifting (in particular 'Casey Jr' and 'Pink Elephants on Parade - their accompanying scenes also stand out very well,') the saddest one for me is 'Baby of Mine.' It made me cry when I was little and it still makes me cry now. Other than that, most of the characters are well-designed, especially Dumbo, Timothy Mouse, Dumbo's mother and the other female elephants; however I found the designs of the boys who taunted Dumbo and were beaten by his mother before she was deemed a mad elephant somewhat old-fashioned as well as the opening cards. Nevertheless, these aspects are forgivable for the film's era. The film's pace was relatively swift as well due to its length of just over an hour. Overall this is a timeless film that was worth re-visiting, albeit the tear-jerking 'Baby of Mine' sequence and a couple of old-fashioned aspects. 8/10.

    Dumbo is among the original Disney masterpieces, and masterpiece it is! My review is probably not necessary because most people have seen it by now, but I feel the need to include it because it is one of my favorite Disney Originals. Dumbo has the lovable circus characters, a funny little mouse and who can ever forget the Pink Elephants On Parade scene? I think Disney nailed this one by not making Dumbo a talking character because it makes his emotions on his face and in his actions all the more powerful. There is classic, circus-based soundtracks that add to the excitement, and of course the famous Baby Mine scene that was good enough to have been covered by many celebrities including Bette Midler. Classic family fun!

    Hands down, Dumbo will always be a Disney animation classic. The plot is rather simple, it's your basic Rudolph the Reindeer type of a story of a child who is a different to the point that makes them outcast amongst society. They get laugh at, discrimination, or mistreated. In this case, it's Dumbo's ears. It's a simple story of overcoming a difference that life threw at you and finding out how you can adapt to it. This may be a simple story but for me, it works for me and really, it's the characters that help to sell the story. Based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson, the story is about Jumbo JR who is cruelly mock to the point, that he was 'nickname' Dumbo. I love all his expressions are expressed through body language seeing as he doesn't talk but that comes from the fact that he's just a baby but even still, it works in the film and even without the dialogue, it is easy to pick up on Dumbo's emotions. His only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy (Edward Brophy). While the elephants don't like the mouse, Dumbo finds a paternal figure in him while his mother is locked up trying to protect him. While the movie loves to point out that this is a flying Elephant movie, in truth, Dumbo only flies in the last 10 minutes of the film. This is where the plot device comes into play. On his journey of self-discovery, Dumbo meets a group of Crows that teach Dumbo how to fly using a Magic Feather. It wasn't magic, as it was meant to give him a boost in courage. Now there has been a bunch of controversial about the black crows. In my opinion, I don't find it racist. The racism accusations around the crows usually centers somewhat around the fact that the leader crow is named, "Jim." It's making a joke out of the Jim Crow laws. The crow leader is the only white actor playing a crow. It's Cliff Edwards (the voice of Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio). I do like James Baskett as one of the crows. He will play Uncle Remus in Song of the South later on his career adding more to the controversial. Now as far as the crow debate goes, I never had any problems with them at all since in turn, they were integral to Dumbo's growth in the end. They were cool then and still are cool now. I guess I can see how they could be considered a bit racially insensitive, but even then it was portraying non-negative stereotypes, not negative ones. It wasn't like they were picking at watermelon slices, eating fried chicken or anything. Yes, the crows were portrayed akin to a very popular racial stereotype, "the Sambo." The Sambo is portrayed as a lazy, ignorant and enthusiastic bum. Like other racial stereotypes, such as The Mammy, the Tom and so on, they were popularized portrayals used in racist minstrel shows. The decision to name the lead crow Jim, in tandem with portraying the crows as Sambo stereotypes, makes the Crows more of an insult aimed at the civil rights movement and their efforts than innocent, plucky birds. The fact that Disney managed to disguise this racism in the form of innocent, plucky birds and marketed it makes it kind of insidious. Still, this band of crows that are cool, funny, clever and snarky. True, they start out a little cold hearted, but ultimately show to be very upright people underneath once they learn of Dumbo's plight and help him accomplish the impossible. In fact, taken in context, they're the only morally decent characters besides Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy. All the other "white" characters are portrayed as haughty, selfish, big headed, mean, ignorant, and hurtful. The gossipy elephants, the cruel circus children, the pompous ring leader, and the horrible clowns all in some way hurt or endanger Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo for self-gain. Plus, "When I See a Elephant Fly" is one of the cleverest, funniest, and catchiest songs in a Disney movie. The other good song was "Baby Mine", I have no regrets in admitting that every time the song comes on, I always cry. Despite what I may feel or whatever goes on with the family, it brings back to joy and comfort that I cry in a good way for loving my family. The only reason Dumbo's mother is in there in the first place is because she was trying to protect him, he can't really see her and they can't touch much. Add that to the song itself, then the fact that they show all the other baby animals in the circus asleep with their mother's. So yeah, Disney really know how to make a tearjerker when they want to. The other songs are pointless. The Pink Elephants on Parade scene scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid, and wasn't needed. Look Out for Mr. Stork is a catchy barber song. Still, dated and was a bit odd. If you're on birth control he won't find you. It's time for lemonade and cracker jacks Casey junior's back was bad. The animation was simplicity due to an animators strike. It was a deliberate pursuit due to that, as Pinoccohio and Fantasia were both flops at the time due to the work detail need for those films. If Dumbo wasn't a success, Disney would have closed down its studios since they lost a lot of money on those films. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. The animators wouldn't have return until the following year with Bambi. A number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns. Overall: Dumbo is emotional, atmosphere works fast paced, energetic and fun.

    Dumbo was released a year after Fantasia in 1941. This film is about a male elephant who was born with huge ears gets constantly made fun of by the other elephants in the circus, and the humans. After a boy goes too far into picking on Dumbo, his mother goes crazy, and gets locked up in a speedster place for crazy animals. Dumbo then gets put into an act where he falls a ridiculously high distance. Will he be able to shine in the circus? This film may not be as good as the previous three, it is still a good quality film. A bit on the short side, you way to know what happens next in the plot. The characters are all endearing; Dumbo has a clear personality (even though he does not talk) and you do feel sorry for him, the mouse that helps Dumbo is a cute and entertaining character. The crows are hilarious, and are definitely one of the best aspects of the movie, and the mother elephant is a typical mother who watches out for their kid. The songs are pretty good as well. "Baby Mine" is a slow, emotional, melodic tune, "When I See An Elephant Fly" is an upbeat track that makes you want to dance, and the score is very good as well. The animation is not as good as the previous 3 (because of its small budget), but it is still very interesting, and you could tell that they animated it, so it could stand out from the other films. The Pink Elephant scene is so cool. The way that they go about and move is so brilliant and is beyond words. This is ranked lower than the others because although it is a great film, it is a bit too short (a bit over an hour), and the fact that it does not leave much of an impact on you like the others do. I think that if the film was a bit longer, you would get a bit more invested into it. If you want to watch a short, entertaining family movie, Dumbo is the movie to go to.

    One of the shortest, the cheapest and simplest of Disney's animated films, Dumbo also happens to be one of the best. Stung by the fall-out from Fantasia, Disney returned to the story telling qualities that had made Pinocchio so successful. The simple story finds a baby elephant born with over sized ears who is separated from his mother when she's locked away for trying to protect him. Ostracised by his own kind and a figure of fun to the human public, Dumbo skulks away with his only friend, Timothy Q. Mouse. At the pinnacle of their adventure together, Dumbo discovers he has a talent, a talent that will change his life forever. And that's all there is to it. Only it's a picture that pulls on a myriad of emotions, it's funny, sad, exciting, and a great message movie as well. Delightful for the kids and ever watchable for adults of all ages, it's totally reliant on the animals for characterisations, where amazingly Dumbo is the one animal on show who doesn't speak! But it matters not, such is Disney when on top form, the animation is so great that just from Dumbo's expressions we know how he is feeling. Some wonderful tunes in here as well, including the quite beautiful "Baby Mine", while a surreal hallucination sequence (Pink Elephants On Parade) that plays out as Dumbo and Timothy accidentally drink liquor, is remarkable. There has been some balking at the black characterisations via some jaunty and funky crows, but they are immensely funny and for 1941 they be crafted with love and there's not a hint of being aware to racial stereotypes. Disney "A" League is Dumbo. 10/10

    Mere months before the U.S. entered World War II, Disney released its fourth major animated film, "Dumbo." At an unusually short 63 minutes, "Dumbo" tells a simple story of an elephant separated from his mother and picked on for his over-sized ears, who with the help of a circus mouse, must learn to love and believe in himself. "Dumbo" is really a short film padded by artistic sequences set to moving, Oscar-winning music. It opens with storks delivering babies to all the animals involved in a traveling circus. The kangaroo gets her baby, the tiger gets her babies and even the hippo gets her baby, but poor Mrs. Jumbo the elephant is left empty-handed. This sets the tone for the alienation both she and her soon-to-arrive child, Jumbo Jr., will experience throughout the film. When Mr. Stork (Sterling Holloway) eventually delivers Jumbo Jr., he and his mother become a laughing stock when the other lady elephants see his gigantic ears, nicknaming him "Dumbo." At one point at a circus stop, several spectators tease Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo goes mad with rage. The Ringmaster (Herman Bing) has her chained up in a train car and Dumbo is left to fend for himself Â— until he's befriended by Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy). Timothy thinks Dumbo's ears suit him well and believes he could be a star. He becomes Dumbo's life coach and only companion. The tender relationship between Dumbo and his mother (which would become a major dynamic in Disney's next film, "Bambi") is the emotional core of the film. Neither character speaks, and so the animators must focus on telling that story through the animation. At one point, a deflated Dumbo reunites with his confined mother and she cradles him in her trunk through the barred windows of the train car as the song "Baby Mine" plays, a timeless lullaby. Even Timothy sheds a tear. It's the most powerful scene in the film and testament to Disney's legacy. "Dumbo" has lots of unforgettable sequences peppered throughout that accompany the extremely basic narrative arc of how wide-eyed Dumbo gets separated from mom, feels shame and embarrassment for who he is and then accepts and believes in himself. Not all of them make sense and many are of questionable appropriateness, but they give "Dumbo" it's unique stamp among the Disney classics. "Song of the Roustabouts," for example, is a terrifying sequence in which the elephants, along with several African-American laborers, pitch the Big Top tent in the middle of a booming thunderstorm. The way light flashes and the wind whips water all about creates a fascinating mood, but the juxtaposition of circus animal labor and the presumed labor of free but unequal blacks makes it a strange scene to wedge into the beginning of the movie. "Pink Elephants on Parade" later in the movie is a visually daring and impressive sequence, but it's wildly inappropriate and arguably unnecessary. After Dumbo is made the butt of a joke in the clown act at the circus that proves successful, the clowns celebrate in their tent. Their liquor spikes the water bucket Dumbo and Timothy drink from and suddenly our main characters are having drunken hallucinations of color-changing elephants in a sequence clearly borrowing from the spirit of "Fantasia," which came out the year before. They wake up the next morning hanging from a tree, which leads Timothy to suppose Dumbo flew them up there in their drunken stupor. So, essentially, an accidental drunken episode leads to Dumbo's discovery of his amazing talent. At that point we meet the black crows, several jive-talking caricatures of African-Americans led by a character named Jim Crow (Cliff Edwards). Even if you assume the best of intentions on Disney's end, there's still a lot of insensitivity to be accounted for. At the same time, while they mock Dumbo at first, they apologize and are among few characters to be nice to him. Over time, these regrettable choices have given "Dumbo" its own unique flavor and helped it become a classic that stands on its own merits in Disney's canon, not a film that has simply been bolstered by the films made before and after it. Coming off "Fantasia" and "Pinocchio," "Dumbo" delivered the same emotional punch with less at its disposal in terms of story and visual detail. It's over in a flash, but "Dumbo" stands out with more than big ears. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com

    Dumbo (1941) **** (out of 4) One of Disney's greatest and cutest films centers on the elephant Dumbo, a small elephant with incredibly large ears. The large ears cause him to be picked on by many but with the help of his only friend, a mouse, he starts to be praised for what he can do. DUMBO is without question one of the studios greatest films and I think I'd say that it's also their very cutest. I think the characters here are among some of the best ever done for the studio and the screenplay is quite simple but it milks ever bit of emotion it can from the viewer. The most noticeable thing about watching this film today is how mean everyone in it is towards Dumbo. I'm sure most parents will be turned off by the behavior and I'm sure kids will be able to connect with Dumbo. There's no question that there's a message to be learned here and it's hard to believe that anyone could see this movie and not feel bad if they're the person picking on someone or get courage if they're the person being picked on. The story itself is quite simple and predictable but the characters from the leads to the supporting elephants to the crows are just so memorable and perfectly written. The songs here aren't quite as impressive as some of the other Disney films of this era but they're still pretty good. The animation is also quite simple but I thought this approach added for some beautiful scenes. DUMBO is clearly a film that works on so many levels and it remains one of the best of its kind.

    The classic Dumbo is a short movie about a cute little elephant who has self-image issues because of his big ears. It's a good lesson for kids everywhere - take what other people see as something bad about you and turn it into something positive. There's lots of animals in the animated movie, and we are introduced to most of them at the beginning of the movie. Storks are seen delivering babies everywhere - keeping with the old time explanation of "where do babies come from?" Other animals seen are bears, kangaroos, fish, tigers, giraffes, elephants, birds, monkeys, foxes, ostriches, snakes, horses, camels, zebras, hippos, gorillas, and even a mouse. Objects are person-fied in this movie. such as the train that talks. Animals are more like people then animals. The cut mouse who gives Dumbo his confidence, Mrs. Jumbo and her annoyingly rude companions, Mr. Stork. Comedy is written in a way that is funny for the adults as well as the children. I love when the stork is sitting on the cloud (every child imagines sitting on a cloud) and looking down on the earth at a map of the United States. The stork is constantly having to retrieve Dumbo as he sinks through the cloud. My favorite song is "When I See an Elephant Fly." Some negative elements: there is alcohol in this movie. We can see men drinking it, then later water is tainted with alcohol and the mouse and Dumbo are drunk. They have a wild vision...

    The 70th anniversary Blu-Ray of Dumbo is a must have for Disney fans and classic animation fans alike. The movie has been restored beautifully, showcasing the charming water-colored backgrounds, and the animation just pops off the screen in High-Def, like a living painting. Years ago when I seen a documentary about how Disney was using computers to clean up their classic animated films frame by frame I wasn't sure how the result would be, but the movie looks like it was just made, and not in a bad way. The sound is equally well restored, not over-blown but above and beyond most movies over 70 years old. A huge improvement over the DVD release from 2001. The movie if you are one of the few people on earth not familiar with the tale, is about a baby elephant with extremely large ears, named Jumbo Jr, but after being mocked the name "Dumbo" sticks. Despite this, with the help of his friend, a mouse, Timothy Q. Mouse, he soars above his bullies in more ways than one. Dumbo is presented in it's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and you can chose to watch it with black bars on the sides, or changing art panels that reflect each scene. There is also a Cine-Explore experience, with historians and animators taking you through the movie, a deleted scene and song, a documentary on the making of the film, a feturette called Celebrating Dumbo, and one on the ride at Disney Land, an audio commentary, a pair of classic Disney Shorts "The Flying Mouse" and "Elmer Elephant" (both in HD as are most the special features), and some games for the kids. A nice package for a classic film. RATING: MOVIE: 10 out of 10 AUDIO/VIDEO: 9 out of 10, 10 out of 10 EXTRAS: 9 out of 10

    I think it's pretty safe to say that we all have been in the same shoes as the main character of Walt Disney's 4th animated feature Dumbo (1941) at least once in our lives before. Anyone who had either seen this picture or had been picked on and/or bullied in school knows what it feels like to go through whatever the main character goes through in this film. The biggest reason why Dumbo has always been one of Disney's most timeless animated treasures is because so many of us can identify with the sadness and pain that the title character feels from all the unfortunate circumstances he's put under. Obviously, that isn't the only reason why Dumbo still holds up well after all these years, but more on that later. Our main character of this film is a baby elephant named Dumbo who is ridiculed by fellow circus animals and humans for his enormous ears. His mother Jumbo is the only elephant who is kind to Dumbo and willing to defend him. But when she gets into trouble for trying to protect Dumbo from harm, she gets locked up in a cage and Dumbo is now alone. That's when a circus mouse named Timothy Mouse comes in and becomes his only friend outside his mother. Timothy promises to do whatever he can to help Dumbo overcome his obstacle by making it into his strength. Right off the bat, I should say that I thought it was ingenious to make Dumbo's best friend a mouse, given that elephants are supposed to be afraid of mice for whatever reasons. I liked how even though sad things keep happening to Dumbo, he's the only elephant in the circus that has a mouse for a friend. That was a very clever idea on the writer's part. I also found Dumbo's relationship with his mom to be deeply touching and emotional. The filmmakers were wise to keep the dialogue out of the scenes between Dumbo and his mom and let the heartwarming images drawn by the Disney animators do the talking so to speak. Remember a brief scene early on when Jumbo wraps Dumbo's ears into a blanket and gently rocks him back and forth with her trunk? That was a cute little scene. You couldn't make this part of the movie better with dialogue since it manages to work perfectly well as it is. Speaking of great scenes, how about that infamous pink elephants sequence? Make all the arguments you like about how it contributes little to the plot and how a certain scene before it could send the wrong message to kids with Dumbo and Timothy Mouse accidentally consuming alcohol. That pink elephants scene is still a cool scene to watch. Considering the time in which it came out and all of the bright, colorful and surreal imagery being shown on screen, that scene was really ahead of its time in terms of its content. In regards to the controversy involving the crows that help Dumbo discover his true destiny and whether or not they are racist, I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about. In my opinion, they were just cool, free-spirited creatures who are just enjoying life. On top of that, the main leader of the group was voiced by a white person (Cliff Edwards to be precise, who's also famous for his voice-over work for Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio (1940)), so it makes the argument a tad less credible. Personally, nothing about these crows would've offended me if I was an African-American. If there was a scene that would have offended me if I were an African-American, it would be the Roustabouts song earlier in the film. I'm shocked that for all the controversy with the crows, how come no one seems to be offended by the Roustabouts scene? It clearly involves African-American slaves setting up the circus tents along with the circus animals. If that wasn't enough for this scene to repel any African-Americans, then some of the lyrics are. I swear I heard these very words somewhere in the songÂ… "We don't know when we get our pay, and when we do we throw our pay away". They're basically saying that they're enjoying being hard-working slaves and that they only enjoy living for that reason. I guess it just goes to show you how complicated race issues can really become, but I just think America was calling racism on the wrong part of the movie. In the tradition of the best Disney pictures, another one of the film's strengths is in its music and songs arranged by Frank Churchill, Oliver Wallace, and Ned Washington. Along with its wide range of music whether it's softer music or circus music, the film's songs are still memorable to this day especially "Casey Junior", "Baby Mine" and "When I See An Elephant Fly". The music and songs have noteworthy variety to them and they are all handled very well. The animation was intended to be a little less advanced than the three previous Disney films before it (Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia), but it's still well done in its own right. The animation compliments the simple story that is being told well enough. There's no need to remake it and advance the animation further, it somehow works just fine as it is. Dumbo was intended to be a simpler film than the previous Disney animated features before it both with its animation and its story. And yet, it manages to equal and even top the three Disney films that came before it because it has the best balance of everything that made Disney films terrific to begin with. Even with a brief running time of just over an hour, Dumbo is more evidence that a great film which lasts just over an hour is preferable to a lousy film that lasts around two hours.

    Like 'Snow White,' this is one old Disney film that made me both cry and smile. I watched this film on a flight home from Dubai a few months ago after not having seen it since I was a child. Also as a child, I had a small cuddly toy of Dumbo that I was probably given when I was a baby. This film is rather sophisticated for its time due to its fluid animation and detailed backgrounds throughout. Pretty much all the songs are memorable. While the majority of them are uplifting (in particular 'Casey Jr' and 'Pink Elephants on Parade - their accompanying scenes also stand out very well,') the saddest one for me is 'Baby of Mine.' It made me cry when I was little and it still makes me cry now. Other than that, most of the characters are well-designed, especially Dumbo, Timothy Mouse, Dumbo's mother and the other female elephants; however I found the designs of the boys who taunted Dumbo and were beaten by his mother before she was deemed a mad elephant somewhat old-fashioned as well as the opening cards. Nevertheless, these aspects are forgivable for the film's era. The film's pace was relatively swift as well due to its length of just over an hour. Overall this is a timeless film that was worth re-visiting, albeit the tear-jerking 'Baby of Mine' sequence and a couple of old-fashioned aspects. 8/10.

    Dumbo is among the original Disney masterpieces, and masterpiece it is! My review is probably not necessary because most people have seen it by now, but I feel the need to include it because it is one of my favorite Disney Originals. Dumbo has the lovable circus characters, a funny little mouse and who can ever forget the Pink Elephants On Parade scene? I think Disney nailed this one by not making Dumbo a talking character because it makes his emotions on his face and in his actions all the more powerful. There is classic, circus-based soundtracks that add to the excitement, and of course the famous Baby Mine scene that was good enough to have been covered by many celebrities including Bette Midler. Classic family fun!

    Hands down, Dumbo will always be a Disney animation classic. The plot is rather simple, it's your basic Rudolph the Reindeer type of a story of a child who is a different to the point that makes them outcast amongst society. They get laugh at, discrimination, or mistreated. In this case, it's Dumbo's ears. It's a simple story of overcoming a difference that life threw at you and finding out how you can adapt to it. This may be a simple story but for me, it works for me and really, it's the characters that help to sell the story. Based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson, the story is about Jumbo JR who is cruelly mock to the point, that he was 'nickname' Dumbo. I love all his expressions are expressed through body language seeing as he doesn't talk but that comes from the fact that he's just a baby but even still, it works in the film and even without the dialogue, it is easy to pick up on Dumbo's emotions. His only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy (Edward Brophy). While the elephants don't like the mouse, Dumbo finds a paternal figure in him while his mother is locked up trying to protect him. While the movie loves to point out that this is a flying Elephant movie, in truth, Dumbo only flies in the last 10 minutes of the film. This is where the plot device comes into play. On his journey of self-discovery, Dumbo meets a group of Crows that teach Dumbo how to fly using a Magic Feather. It wasn't magic, as it was meant to give him a boost in courage. Now there has been a bunch of controversial about the black crows. In my opinion, I don't find it racist. The racism accusations around the crows usually centers somewhat around the fact that the leader crow is named, "Jim." It's making a joke out of the Jim Crow laws. The crow leader is the only white actor playing a crow. It's Cliff Edwards (the voice of Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio). I do like James Baskett as one of the crows. He will play Uncle Remus in Song of the South later on his career adding more to the controversial. Now as far as the crow debate goes, I never had any problems with them at all since in turn, they were integral to Dumbo's growth in the end. They were cool then and still are cool now. I guess I can see how they could be considered a bit racially insensitive, but even then it was portraying non-negative stereotypes, not negative ones. It wasn't like they were picking at watermelon slices, eating fried chicken or anything. Yes, the crows were portrayed akin to a very popular racial stereotype, "the Sambo." The Sambo is portrayed as a lazy, ignorant and enthusiastic bum. Like other racial stereotypes, such as The Mammy, the Tom and so on, they were popularized portrayals used in racist minstrel shows. The decision to name the lead crow Jim, in tandem with portraying the crows as Sambo stereotypes, makes the Crows more of an insult aimed at the civil rights movement and their efforts than innocent, plucky birds. The fact that Disney managed to disguise this racism in the form of innocent, plucky birds and marketed it makes it kind of insidious. Still, this band of crows that are cool, funny, clever and snarky. True, they start out a little cold hearted, but ultimately show to be very upright people underneath once they learn of Dumbo's plight and help him accomplish the impossible. In fact, taken in context, they're the only morally decent characters besides Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy. All the other "white" characters are portrayed as haughty, selfish, big headed, mean, ignorant, and hurtful. The gossipy elephants, the cruel circus children, the pompous ring leader, and the horrible clowns all in some way hurt or endanger Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo for self-gain. Plus, "When I See a Elephant Fly" is one of the cleverest, funniest, and catchiest songs in a Disney movie. The other good song was "Baby Mine", I have no regrets in admitting that every time the song comes on, I always cry. Despite what I may feel or whatever goes on with the family, it brings back to joy and comfort that I cry in a good way for loving my family. The only reason Dumbo's mother is in there in the first place is because she was trying to protect him, he can't really see her and they can't touch much. Add that to the song itself, then the fact that they show all the other baby animals in the circus asleep with their mother's. So yeah, Disney really know how to make a tearjerker when they want to. The other songs are pointless. The Pink Elephants on Parade scene scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid, and wasn't needed. Look Out for Mr. Stork is a catchy barber song. Still, dated and was a bit odd. If you're on birth control he won't find you. It's time for lemonade and cracker jacks Casey junior's back was bad. The animation was simplicity due to an animators strike. It was a deliberate pursuit due to that, as Pinoccohio and Fantasia were both flops at the time due to the work detail need for those films. If Dumbo wasn't a success, Disney would have closed down its studios since they lost a lot of money on those films. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. The animators wouldn't have return until the following year with Bambi. A number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns. Overall: Dumbo is emotional, atmosphere works fast paced, energetic and fun.

    Dumbo was released a year after Fantasia in 1941. This film is about a male elephant who was born with huge ears gets constantly made fun of by the other elephants in the circus, and the humans. After a boy goes too far into picking on Dumbo, his mother goes crazy, and gets locked up in a speedster place for crazy animals. Dumbo then gets put into an act where he falls a ridiculously high distance. Will he be able to shine in the circus? This film may not be as good as the previous three, it is still a good quality film. A bit on the short side, you way to know what happens next in the plot. The characters are all endearing; Dumbo has a clear personality (even though he does not talk) and you do feel sorry for him, the mouse that helps Dumbo is a cute and entertaining character. The crows are hilarious, and are definitely one of the best aspects of the movie, and the mother elephant is a typical mother who watches out for their kid. The songs are pretty good as well. "Baby Mine" is a slow, emotional, melodic tune, "When I See An Elephant Fly" is an upbeat track that makes you want to dance, and the score is very good as well. The animation is not as good as the previous 3 (because of its small budget), but it is still very interesting, and you could tell that they animated it, so it could stand out from the other films. The Pink Elephant scene is so cool. The way that they go about and move is so brilliant and is beyond words. This is ranked lower than the others because although it is a great film, it is a bit too short (a bit over an hour), and the fact that it does not leave much of an impact on you like the others do. I think that if the film was a bit longer, you would get a bit more invested into it. If you want to watch a short, entertaining family movie, Dumbo is the movie to go to.

    One of the shortest, the cheapest and simplest of Disney's animated films, Dumbo also happens to be one of the best. Stung by the fall-out from Fantasia, Disney returned to the story telling qualities that had made Pinocchio so successful. The simple story finds a baby elephant born with over sized ears who is separated from his mother when she's locked away for trying to protect him. Ostracised by his own kind and a figure of fun to the human public, Dumbo skulks away with his only friend, Timothy Q. Mouse. At the pinnacle of their adventure together, Dumbo discovers he has a talent, a talent that will change his life forever. And that's all there is to it. Only it's a picture that pulls on a myriad of emotions, it's funny, sad, exciting, and a great message movie as well. Delightful for the kids and ever watchable for adults of all ages, it's totally reliant on the animals for characterisations, where amazingly Dumbo is the one animal on show who doesn't speak! But it matters not, such is Disney when on top form, the animation is so great that just from Dumbo's expressions we know how he is feeling. Some wonderful tunes in here as well, including the quite beautiful "Baby Mine", while a surreal hallucination sequence (Pink Elephants On Parade) that plays out as Dumbo and Timothy accidentally drink liquor, is remarkable. There has been some balking at the black characterisations via some jaunty and funky crows, but they are immensely funny and for 1941 they be crafted with love and there's not a hint of being aware to racial stereotypes. Disney "A" League is Dumbo. 10/10

    Mere months before the U.S. entered World War II, Disney released its fourth major animated film, "Dumbo." At an unusually short 63 minutes, "Dumbo" tells a simple story of an elephant separated from his mother and picked on for his over-sized ears, who with the help of a circus mouse, must learn to love and believe in himself. "Dumbo" is really a short film padded by artistic sequences set to moving, Oscar-winning music. It opens with storks delivering babies to all the animals involved in a traveling circus. The kangaroo gets her baby, the tiger gets her babies and even the hippo gets her baby, but poor Mrs. Jumbo the elephant is left empty-handed. This sets the tone for the alienation both she and her soon-to-arrive child, Jumbo Jr., will experience throughout the film. When Mr. Stork (Sterling Holloway) eventually delivers Jumbo Jr., he and his mother become a laughing stock when the other lady elephants see his gigantic ears, nicknaming him "Dumbo." At one point at a circus stop, several spectators tease Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo goes mad with rage. The Ringmaster (Herman Bing) has her chained up in a train car and Dumbo is left to fend for himself Â— until he's befriended by Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy). Timothy thinks Dumbo's ears suit him well and believes he could be a star. He becomes Dumbo's life coach and only companion. The tender relationship between Dumbo and his mother (which would become a major dynamic in Disney's next film, "Bambi") is the emotional core of the film. Neither character speaks, and so the animators must focus on telling that story through the animation. At one point, a deflated Dumbo reunites with his confined mother and she cradles him in her trunk through the barred windows of the train car as the song "Baby Mine" plays, a timeless lullaby. Even Timothy sheds a tear. It's the most powerful scene in the film and testament to Disney's legacy. "Dumbo" has lots of unforgettable sequences peppered throughout that accompany the extremely basic narrative arc of how wide-eyed Dumbo gets separated from mom, feels shame and embarrassment for who he is and then accepts and believes in himself. Not all of them make sense and many are of questionable appropriateness, but they give "Dumbo" it's unique stamp among the Disney classics. "Song of the Roustabouts," for example, is a terrifying sequence in which the elephants, along with several African-American laborers, pitch the Big Top tent in the middle of a booming thunderstorm. The way light flashes and the wind whips water all about creates a fascinating mood, but the juxtaposition of circus animal labor and the presumed labor of free but unequal blacks makes it a strange scene to wedge into the beginning of the movie. "Pink Elephants on Parade" later in the movie is a visually daring and impressive sequence, but it's wildly inappropriate and arguably unnecessary. After Dumbo is made the butt of a joke in the clown act at the circus that proves successful, the clowns celebrate in their tent. Their liquor spikes the water bucket Dumbo and Timothy drink from and suddenly our main characters are having drunken hallucinations of color-changing elephants in a sequence clearly borrowing from the spirit of "Fantasia," which came out the year before. They wake up the next morning hanging from a tree, which leads Timothy to suppose Dumbo flew them up there in their drunken stupor. So, essentially, an accidental drunken episode leads to Dumbo's discovery of his amazing talent. At that point we meet the black crows, several jive-talking caricatures of African-Americans led by a character named Jim Crow (Cliff Edwards). Even if you assume the best of intentions on Disney's end, there's still a lot of insensitivity to be accounted for. At the same time, while they mock Dumbo at first, they apologize and are among few characters to be nice to him. Over time, these regrettable choices have given "Dumbo" its own unique flavor and helped it become a classic that stands on its own merits in Disney's canon, not a film that has simply been bolstered by the films made before and after it. Coming off "Fantasia" and "Pinocchio," "Dumbo" delivered the same emotional punch with less at its disposal in terms of story and visual detail. It's over in a flash, but "Dumbo" stands out with more than big ears. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com

    Dumbo (1941) **** (out of 4) One of Disney's greatest and cutest films centers on the elephant Dumbo, a small elephant with incredibly large ears. The large ears cause him to be picked on by many but with the help of his only friend, a mouse, he starts to be praised for what he can do. DUMBO is without question one of the studios greatest films and I think I'd say that it's also their very cutest. I think the characters here are among some of the best ever done for the studio and the screenplay is quite simple but it milks ever bit of emotion it can from the viewer. The most noticeable thing about watching this film today is how mean everyone in it is towards Dumbo. I'm sure most parents will be turned off by the behavior and I'm sure kids will be able to connect with Dumbo. There's no question that there's a message to be learned here and it's hard to believe that anyone could see this movie and not feel bad if they're the person picking on someone or get courage if they're the person being picked on. The story itself is quite simple and predictable but the characters from the leads to the supporting elephants to the crows are just so memorable and perfectly written. The songs here aren't quite as impressive as some of the other Disney films of this era but they're still pretty good. The animation is also quite simple but I thought this approach added for some beautiful scenes. DUMBO is clearly a film that works on so many levels and it remains one of the best of its kind.

    The classic Dumbo is a short movie about a cute little elephant who has self-image issues because of his big ears. It's a good lesson for kids everywhere - take what other people see as something bad about you and turn it into something positive. There's lots of animals in the animated movie, and we are introduced to most of them at the beginning of the movie. Storks are seen delivering babies everywhere - keeping with the old time explanation of "where do babies come from?" Other animals seen are bears, kangaroos, fish, tigers, giraffes, elephants, birds, monkeys, foxes, ostriches, snakes, horses, camels, zebras, hippos, gorillas, and even a mouse. Objects are person-fied in this movie. such as the train that talks. Animals are more like people then animals. The cut mouse who gives Dumbo his confidence, Mrs. Jumbo and her annoyingly rude companions, Mr. Stork. Comedy is written in a way that is funny for the adults as well as the children. I love when the stork is sitting on the cloud (every child imagines sitting on a cloud) and looking down on the earth at a map of the United States. The stork is constantly having to retrieve Dumbo as he sinks through the cloud. My favorite song is "When I See an Elephant Fly." Some negative elements: there is alcohol in this movie. We can see men drinking it, then later water is tainted with alcohol and the mouse and Dumbo are drunk. They have a wild vision...

    The 70th anniversary Blu-Ray of Dumbo is a must have for Disney fans and classic animation fans alike. The movie has been restored beautifully, showcasing the charming water-colored backgrounds, and the animation just pops off the screen in High-Def, like a living painting. Years ago when I seen a documentary about how Disney was using computers to clean up their classic animated films frame by frame I wasn't sure how the result would be, but the movie looks like it was just made, and not in a bad way. The sound is equally well restored, not over-blown but above and beyond most movies over 70 years old. A huge improvement over the DVD release from 2001. The movie if you are one of the few people on earth not familiar with the tale, is about a baby elephant with extremely large ears, named Jumbo Jr, but after being mocked the name "Dumbo" sticks. Despite this, with the help of his friend, a mouse, Timothy Q. Mouse, he soars above his bullies in more ways than one. Dumbo is presented in it's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and you can chose to watch it with black bars on the sides, or changing art panels that reflect each scene. There is also a Cine-Explore experience, with historians and animators taking you through the movie, a deleted scene and song, a documentary on the making of the film, a feturette called Celebrating Dumbo, and one on the ride at Disney Land, an audio commentary, a pair of classic Disney Shorts "The Flying Mouse" and "Elmer Elephant" (both in HD as are most the special features), and some games for the kids. A nice package for a classic film. RATING: MOVIE: 10 out of 10 AUDIO/VIDEO: 9 out of 10, 10 out of 10 EXTRAS: 9 out of 10

    I think it's pretty safe to say that we all have been in the same shoes as the main character of Walt Disney's 4th animated feature Dumbo (1941) at least once in our lives before. Anyone who had either seen this picture or had been picked on and/or bullied in school knows what it feels like to go through whatever the main character goes through in this film. The biggest reason why Dumbo has always been one of Disney's most timeless animated treasures is because so many of us can identify with the sadness and pain that the title character feels from all the unfortunate circumstances he's put under. Obviously, that isn't the only reason why Dumbo still holds up well after all these years, but more on that later. Our main character of this film is a baby elephant named Dumbo who is ridiculed by fellow circus animals and humans for his enormous ears. His mother Jumbo is the only elephant who is kind to Dumbo and willing to defend him. But when she gets into trouble for trying to protect Dumbo from harm, she gets locked up in a cage and Dumbo is now alone. That's when a circus mouse named Timothy Mouse comes in and becomes his only friend outside his mother. Timothy promises to do whatever he can to help Dumbo overcome his obstacle by making it into his strength. Right off the bat, I should say that I thought it was ingenious to make Dumbo's best friend a mouse, given that elephants are supposed to be afraid of mice for whatever reasons. I liked how even though sad things keep happening to Dumbo, he's the only elephant in the circus that has a mouse for a friend. That was a very clever idea on the writer's part. I also found Dumbo's relationship with his mom to be deeply touching and emotional. The filmmakers were wise to keep the dialogue out of the scenes between Dumbo and his mom and let the heartwarming images drawn by the Disney animators do the talking so to speak. Remember a brief scene early on when Jumbo wraps Dumbo's ears into a blanket and gently rocks him back and forth with her trunk? That was a cute little scene. You couldn't make this part of the movie better with dialogue since it manages to work perfectly well as it is. Speaking of great scenes, how about that infamous pink elephants sequence? Make all the arguments you like about how it contributes little to the plot and how a certain scene before it could send the wrong message to kids with Dumbo and Timothy Mouse accidentally consuming alcohol. That pink elephants scene is still a cool scene to watch. Considering the time in which it came out and all of the bright, colorful and surreal imagery being shown on screen, that scene was really ahead of its time in terms of its content. In regards to the controversy involving the crows that help Dumbo discover his true destiny and whether or not they are racist, I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about. In my opinion, they were just cool, free-spirited creatures who are just enjoying life. On top of that, the main leader of the group was voiced by a white person (Cliff Edwards to be precise, who's also famous for his voice-over work for Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio (1940)), so it makes the argument a tad less credible. Personally, nothing about these crows would've offended me if I was an African-American. If there was a scene that would have offended me if I were an African-American, it would be the Roustabouts song earlier in the film. I'm shocked that for all the controversy with the crows, how come no one seems to be offended by the Roustabouts scene? It clearly involves African-American slaves setting up the circus tents along with the circus animals. If that wasn't enough for this scene to repel any African-Americans, then some of the lyrics are. I swear I heard these very words somewhere in the songÂ… "We don't know when we get our pay, and when we do we throw our pay away". They're basically saying that they're enjoying being hard-working slaves and that they only enjoy living for that reason. I guess it just goes to show you how complicated race issues can really become, but I just think America was calling racism on the wrong part of the movie. In the tradition of the best Disney pictures, another one of the film's strengths is in its music and songs arranged by Frank Churchill, Oliver Wallace, and Ned Washington. Along with its wide range of music whether it's softer music or circus music, the film's songs are still memorable to this day especially "Casey Junior", "Baby Mine" and "When I See An Elephant Fly". The music and songs have noteworthy variety to them and they are all handled very well. The animation was intended to be a little less advanced than the three previous Disney films before it (Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia), but it's still well done in its own right. The animation compliments the simple story that is being told well enough. There's no need to remake it and advance the animation further, it somehow works just fine as it is. Dumbo was intended to be a simpler film than the previous Disney animated features before it both with its animation and its story. And yet, it manages to equal and even top the three Disney films that came before it because it has the best balance of everything that made Disney films terrific to begin with. Even with a brief running time of just over an hour, Dumbo is more evidence that a great film which lasts just over an hour is preferable to a lousy film that lasts around two hours.

    Like 'Snow White,' this is one old Disney film that made me both cry and smile. I watched this film on a flight home from Dubai a few months ago after not having seen it since I was a child. Also as a child, I had a small cuddly toy of Dumbo that I was probably given when I was a baby. This film is rather sophisticated for its time due to its fluid animation and detailed backgrounds throughout. Pretty much all the songs are memorable. While the majority of them are uplifting (in particular 'Casey Jr' and 'Pink Elephants on Parade - their accompanying scenes also stand out very well,') the saddest one for me is 'Baby of Mine.' It made me cry when I was little and it still makes me cry now. Other than that, most of the characters are well-designed, especially Dumbo, Timothy Mouse, Dumbo's mother and the other female elephants; however I found the designs of the boys who taunted Dumbo and were beaten by his mother before she was deemed a mad elephant somewhat old-fashioned as well as the opening cards. Nevertheless, these aspects are forgivable for the film's era. The film's pace was relatively swift as well due to its length of just over an hour. Overall this is a timeless film that was worth re-visiting, albeit the tear-jerking 'Baby of Mine' sequence and a couple of old-fashioned aspects. 8/10.

    Dumbo is among the original Disney masterpieces, and masterpiece it is! My review is probably not necessary because most people have seen it by now, but I feel the need to include it because it is one of my favorite Disney Originals. Dumbo has the lovable circus characters, a funny little mouse and who can ever forget the Pink Elephants On Parade scene? I think Disney nailed this one by not making Dumbo a talking character because it makes his emotions on his face and in his actions all the more powerful. There is classic, circus-based soundtracks that add to the excitement, and of course the famous Baby Mine scene that was good enough to have been covered by many celebrities including Bette Midler. Classic family fun!

    Hands down, Dumbo will always be a Disney animation classic. The plot is rather simple, it's your basic Rudolph the Reindeer type of a story of a child who is a different to the point that makes them outcast amongst society. They get laugh at, discrimination, or mistreated. In this case, it's Dumbo's ears. It's a simple story of overcoming a difference that life threw at you and finding out how you can adapt to it. This may be a simple story but for me, it works for me and really, it's the characters that help to sell the story. Based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson, the story is about Jumbo JR who is cruelly mock to the point, that he was 'nickname' Dumbo. I love all his expressions are expressed through body language seeing as he doesn't talk but that comes from the fact that he's just a baby but even still, it works in the film and even without the dialogue, it is easy to pick up on Dumbo's emotions. His only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy (Edward Brophy). While the elephants don't like the mouse, Dumbo finds a paternal figure in him while his mother is locked up trying to protect him. While the movie loves to point out that this is a flying Elephant movie, in truth, Dumbo only flies in the last 10 minutes of the film. This is where the plot device comes into play. On his journey of self-discovery, Dumbo meets a group of Crows that teach Dumbo how to fly using a Magic Feather. It wasn't magic, as it was meant to give him a boost in courage. Now there has been a bunch of controversial about the black crows. In my opinion, I don't find it racist. The racism accusations around the crows usually centers somewhat around the fact that the leader crow is named, "Jim." It's making a joke out of the Jim Crow laws. The crow leader is the only white actor playing a crow. It's Cliff Edwards (the voice of Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio). I do like James Baskett as one of the crows. He will play Uncle Remus in Song of the South later on his career adding more to the controversial. Now as far as the crow debate goes, I never had any problems with them at all since in turn, they were integral to Dumbo's growth in the end. They were cool then and still are cool now. I guess I can see how they could be considered a bit racially insensitive, but even then it was portraying non-negative stereotypes, not negative ones. It wasn't like they were picking at watermelon slices, eating fried chicken or anything. Yes, the crows were portrayed akin to a very popular racial stereotype, "the Sambo." The Sambo is portrayed as a lazy, ignorant and enthusiastic bum. Like other racial stereotypes, such as The Mammy, the Tom and so on, they were popularized portrayals used in racist minstrel shows. The decision to name the lead crow Jim, in tandem with portraying the crows as Sambo stereotypes, makes the Crows more of an insult aimed at the civil rights movement and their efforts than innocent, plucky birds. The fact that Disney managed to disguise this racism in the form of innocent, plucky birds and marketed it makes it kind of insidious. Still, this band of crows that are cool, funny, clever and snarky. True, they start out a little cold hearted, but ultimately show to be very upright people underneath once they learn of Dumbo's plight and help him accomplish the impossible. In fact, taken in context, they're the only morally decent characters besides Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy. All the other "white" characters are portrayed as haughty, selfish, big headed, mean, ignorant, and hurtful. The gossipy elephants, the cruel circus children, the pompous ring leader, and the horrible clowns all in some way hurt or endanger Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo for self-gain. Plus, "When I See a Elephant Fly" is one of the cleverest, funniest, and catchiest songs in a Disney movie. The other good song was "Baby Mine", I have no regrets in admitting that every time the song comes on, I always cry. Despite what I may feel or whatever goes on with the family, it brings back to joy and comfort that I cry in a good way for loving my family. The only reason Dumbo's mother is in there in the first place is because she was trying to protect him, he can't really see her and they can't touch much. Add that to the song itself, then the fact that they show all the other baby animals in the circus asleep with their mother's. So yeah, Disney really know how to make a tearjerker when they want to. The other songs are pointless. The Pink Elephants on Parade scene scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid, and wasn't needed. Look Out for Mr. Stork is a catchy barber song. Still, dated and was a bit odd. If you're on birth control he won't find you. It's time for lemonade and cracker jacks Casey junior's back was bad. The animation was simplicity due to an animators strike. It was a deliberate pursuit due to that, as Pinoccohio and Fantasia were both flops at the time due to the work detail need for those films. If Dumbo wasn't a success, Disney would have closed down its studios since they lost a lot of money on those films. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. The animators wouldn't have return until the following year with Bambi. A number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns. Overall: Dumbo is emotional, atmosphere works fast paced, energetic and fun.

    Dumbo was released a year after Fantasia in 1941. This film is about a male elephant who was born with huge ears gets constantly made fun of by the other elephants in the circus, and the humans. After a boy goes too far into picking on Dumbo, his mother goes crazy, and gets locked up in a speedster place for crazy animals. Dumbo then gets put into an act where he falls a ridiculously high distance. Will he be able to shine in the circus? This film may not be as good as the previous three, it is still a good quality film. A bit on the short side, you way to know what happens next in the plot. The characters are all endearing; Dumbo has a clear personality (even though he does not talk) and you do feel sorry for him, the mouse that helps Dumbo is a cute and entertaining character. The crows are hilarious, and are definitely one of the best aspects of the movie, and the mother elephant is a typical mother who watches out for their kid. The songs are pretty good as well. "Baby Mine" is a slow, emotional, melodic tune, "When I See An Elephant Fly" is an upbeat track that makes you want to dance, and the score is very good as well. The animation is not as good as the previous 3 (because of its small budget), but it is still very interesting, and you could tell that they animated it, so it could stand out from the other films. The Pink Elephant scene is so cool. The way that they go about and move is so brilliant and is beyond words. This is ranked lower than the others because although it is a great film, it is a bit too short (a bit over an hour), and the fact that it does not leave much of an impact on you like the others do. I think that if the film was a bit longer, you would get a bit more invested into it. If you want to watch a short, entertaining family movie, Dumbo is the movie to go to.

    One of the shortest, the cheapest and simplest of Disney's animated films, Dumbo also happens to be one of the best. Stung by the fall-out from Fantasia, Disney returned to the story telling qualities that had made Pinocchio so successful. The simple story finds a baby elephant born with over sized ears who is separated from his mother when she's locked away for trying to protect him. Ostracised by his own kind and a figure of fun to the human public, Dumbo skulks away with his only friend, Timothy Q. Mouse. At the pinnacle of their adventure together, Dumbo discovers he has a talent, a talent that will change his life forever. And that's all there is to it. Only it's a picture that pulls on a myriad of emotions, it's funny, sad, exciting, and a great message movie as well. Delightful for the kids and ever watchable for adults of all ages, it's totally reliant on the animals for characterisations, where amazingly Dumbo is the one animal on show who doesn't speak! But it matters not, such is Disney when on top form, the animation is so great that just from Dumbo's expressions we know how he is feeling. Some wonderful tunes in here as well, including the quite beautiful "Baby Mine", while a surreal hallucination sequence (Pink Elephants On Parade) that plays out as Dumbo and Timothy accidentally drink liquor, is remarkable. There has been some balking at the black characterisations via some jaunty and funky crows, but they are immensely funny and for 1941 they be crafted with love and there's not a hint of being aware to racial stereotypes. Disney "A" League is Dumbo. 10/10

    Mere months before the U.S. entered World War II, Disney released its fourth major animated film, "Dumbo." At an unusually short 63 minutes, "Dumbo" tells a simple story of an elephant separated from his mother and picked on for his over-sized ears, who with the help of a circus mouse, must learn to love and believe in himself. "Dumbo" is really a short film padded by artistic sequences set to moving, Oscar-winning music. It opens with storks delivering babies to all the animals involved in a traveling circus. The kangaroo gets her baby, the tiger gets her babies and even the hippo gets her baby, but poor Mrs. Jumbo the elephant is left empty-handed. This sets the tone for the alienation both she and her soon-to-arrive child, Jumbo Jr., will experience throughout the film. When Mr. Stork (Sterling Holloway) eventually delivers Jumbo Jr., he and his mother become a laughing stock when the other lady elephants see his gigantic ears, nicknaming him "Dumbo." At one point at a circus stop, several spectators tease Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo goes mad with rage. The Ringmaster (Herman Bing) has her chained up in a train car and Dumbo is left to fend for himself Â— until he's befriended by Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy). Timothy thinks Dumbo's ears suit him well and believes he could be a star. He becomes Dumbo's life coach and only companion. The tender relationship between Dumbo and his mother (which would become a major dynamic in Disney's next film, "Bambi") is the emotional core of the film. Neither character speaks, and so the animators must focus on telling that story through the animation. At one point, a deflated Dumbo reunites with his confined mother and she cradles him in her trunk through the barred windows of the train car as the song "Baby Mine" plays, a timeless lullaby. Even Timothy sheds a tear. It's the most powerful scene in the film and testament to Disney's legacy. "Dumbo" has lots of unforgettable sequences peppered throughout that accompany the extremely basic narrative arc of how wide-eyed Dumbo gets separated from mom, feels shame and embarrassment for who he is and then accepts and believes in himself. Not all of them make sense and many are of questionable appropriateness, but they give "Dumbo" it's unique stamp among the Disney classics. "Song of the Roustabouts," for example, is a terrifying sequence in which the elephants, along with several African-American laborers, pitch the Big Top tent in the middle of a booming thunderstorm. The way light flashes and the wind whips water all about creates a fascinating mood, but the juxtaposition of circus animal labor and the presumed labor of free but unequal blacks makes it a strange scene to wedge into the beginning of the movie. "Pink Elephants on Parade" later in the movie is a visually daring and impressive sequence, but it's wildly inappropriate and arguably unnecessary. After Dumbo is made the butt of a joke in the clown act at the circus that proves successful, the clowns celebrate in their tent. Their liquor spikes the water bucket Dumbo and Timothy drink from and suddenly our main characters are having drunken hallucinations of color-changing elephants in a sequence clearly borrowing from the spirit of "Fantasia," which came out the year before. They wake up the next morning hanging from a tree, which leads Timothy to suppose Dumbo flew them up there in their drunken stupor. So, essentially, an accidental drunken episode leads to Dumbo's discovery of his amazing talent. At that point we meet the black crows, several jive-talking caricatures of African-Americans led by a character named Jim Crow (Cliff Edwards). Even if you assume the best of intentions on Disney's end, there's still a lot of insensitivity to be accounted for. At the same time, while they mock Dumbo at first, they apologize and are among few characters to be nice to him. Over time, these regrettable choices have given "Dumbo" its own unique flavor and helped it become a classic that stands on its own merits in Disney's canon, not a film that has simply been bolstered by the films made before and after it. Coming off "Fantasia" and "Pinocchio," "Dumbo" delivered the same emotional punch with less at its disposal in terms of story and visual detail. It's over in a flash, but "Dumbo" stands out with more than big ears. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com

    Dumbo (1941) **** (out of 4) One of Disney's greatest and cutest films centers on the elephant Dumbo, a small elephant with incredibly large ears. The large ears cause him to be picked on by many but with the help of his only friend, a mouse, he starts to be praised for what he can do. DUMBO is without question one of the studios greatest films and I think I'd say that it's also their very cutest. I think the characters here are among some of the best ever done for the studio and the screenplay is quite simple but it milks ever bit of emotion it can from the viewer. The most noticeable thing about watching this film today is how mean everyone in it is towards Dumbo. I'm sure most parents will be turned off by the behavior and I'm sure kids will be able to connect with Dumbo. There's no question that there's a message to be learned here and it's hard to believe that anyone could see this movie and not feel bad if they're the person picking on someone or get courage if they're the person being picked on. The story itself is quite simple and predictable but the characters from the leads to the supporting elephants to the crows are just so memorable and perfectly written. The songs here aren't quite as impressive as some of the other Disney films of this era but they're still pretty good. The animation is also quite simple but I thought this approach added for some beautiful scenes. DUMBO is clearly a film that works on so many levels and it remains one of the best of its kind.

    The classic Dumbo is a short movie about a cute little elephant who has self-image issues because of his big ears. It's a good lesson for kids everywhere - take what other people see as something bad about you and turn it into something positive. There's lots of animals in the animated movie, and we are introduced to most of them at the beginning of the movie. Storks are seen delivering babies everywhere - keeping with the old time explanation of "where do babies come from?" Other animals seen are bears, kangaroos, fish, tigers, giraffes, elephants, birds, monkeys, foxes, ostriches, snakes, horses, camels, zebras, hippos, gorillas, and even a mouse. Objects are person-fied in this movie. such as the train that talks. Animals are more like people then animals. The cut mouse who gives Dumbo his confidence, Mrs. Jumbo and her annoyingly rude companions, Mr. Stork. Comedy is written in a way that is funny for the adults as well as the children. I love when the stork is sitting on the cloud (every child imagines sitting on a cloud) and looking down on the earth at a map of the United States. The stork is constantly having to retrieve Dumbo as he sinks through the cloud. My favorite song is "When I See an Elephant Fly." Some negative elements: there is alcohol in this movie. We can see men drinking it, then later water is tainted with alcohol and the mouse and Dumbo are drunk. They have a wild vision...

    The 70th anniversary Blu-Ray of Dumbo is a must have for Disney fans and classic animation fans alike. The movie has been restored beautifully, showcasing the charming water-colored backgrounds, and the animation just pops off the screen in High-Def, like a living painting. Years ago when I seen a documentary about how Disney was using computers to clean up their classic animated films frame by frame I wasn't sure how the result would be, but the movie looks like it was just made, and not in a bad way. The sound is equally well restored, not over-blown but above and beyond most movies over 70 years old. A huge improvement over the DVD release from 2001. The movie if you are one of the few people on earth not familiar with the tale, is about a baby elephant with extremely large ears, named Jumbo Jr, but after being mocked the name "Dumbo" sticks. Despite this, with the help of his friend, a mouse, Timothy Q. Mouse, he soars above his bullies in more ways than one. Dumbo is presented in it's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and you can chose to watch it with black bars on the sides, or changing art panels that reflect each scene. There is also a Cine-Explore experience, with historians and animators taking you through the movie, a deleted scene and song, a documentary on the making of the film, a feturette called Celebrating Dumbo, and one on the ride at Disney Land, an audio commentary, a pair of classic Disney Shorts "The Flying Mouse" and "Elmer Elephant" (both in HD as are most the special features), and some games for the kids. A nice package for a classic film. RATING: MOVIE: 10 out of 10 AUDIO/VIDEO: 9 out of 10, 10 out of 10 EXTRAS: 9 out of 10

    I think it's pretty safe to say that we all have been in the same shoes as the main character of Walt Disney's 4th animated feature Dumbo (1941) at least once in our lives before. Anyone who had either seen this picture or had been picked on and/or bullied in school knows what it feels like to go through whatever the main character goes through in this film. The biggest reason why Dumbo has always been one of Disney's most timeless animated treasures is because so many of us can identify with the sadness and pain that the title character feels from all the unfortunate circumstances he's put under. Obviously, that isn't the only reason why Dumbo still holds up well after all these years, but more on that later. Our main character of this film is a baby elephant named Dumbo who is ridiculed by fellow circus animals and humans for his enormous ears. His mother Jumbo is the only elephant who is kind to Dumbo and willing to defend him. But when she gets into trouble for trying to protect Dumbo from harm, she gets locked up in a cage and Dumbo is now alone. That's when a circus mouse named Timothy Mouse comes in and becomes his only friend outside his mother. Timothy promises to do whatever he can to help Dumbo overcome his obstacle by making it into his strength. Right off the bat, I should say that I thought it was ingenious to make Dumbo's best friend a mouse, given that elephants are supposed to be afraid of mice for whatever reasons. I liked how even though sad things keep happening to Dumbo, he's the only elephant in the circus that has a mouse for a friend. That was a very clever idea on the writer's part. I also found Dumbo's relationship with his mom to be deeply touching and emotional. The filmmakers were wise to keep the dialogue out of the scenes between Dumbo and his mom and let the heartwarming images drawn by the Disney animators do the talking so to speak. Remember a brief scene early on when Jumbo wraps Dumbo's ears into a blanket and gently rocks him back and forth with her trunk? That was a cute little scene. You couldn't make this part of the movie better with dialogue since it manages to work perfectly well as it is. Speaking of great scenes, how about that infamous pink elephants sequence? Make all the arguments you like about how it contributes little to the plot and how a certain scene before it could send the wrong message to kids with Dumbo and Timothy Mouse accidentally consuming alcohol. That pink elephants scene is still a cool scene to watch. Considering the time in which it came out and all of the bright, colorful and surreal imagery being shown on screen, that scene was really ahead of its time in terms of its content. In regards to the controversy involving the crows that help Dumbo discover his true destiny and whether or not they are racist, I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about. In my opinion, they were just cool, free-spirited creatures who are just enjoying life. On top of that, the main leader of the group was voiced by a white person (Cliff Edwards to be precise, who's also famous for his voice-over work for Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio (1940)), so it makes the argument a tad less credible. Personally, nothing about these crows would've offended me if I was an African-American. If there was a scene that would have offended me if I were an African-American, it would be the Roustabouts song earlier in the film. I'm shocked that for all the controversy with the crows, how come no one seems to be offended by the Roustabouts scene? It clearly involves African-American slaves setting up the circus tents along with the circus animals. If that wasn't enough for this scene to repel any African-Americans, then some of the lyrics are. I swear I heard these very words somewhere in the songÂ… "We don't know when we get our pay, and when we do we throw our pay away". They're basically saying that they're enjoying being hard-working slaves and that they only enjoy living for that reason. I guess it just goes to show you how complicated race issues can really become, but I just think America was calling racism on the wrong part of the movie. In the tradition of the best Disney pictures, another one of the film's strengths is in its music and songs arranged by Frank Churchill, Oliver Wallace, and Ned Washington. Along with its wide range of music whether it's softer music or circus music, the film's songs are still memorable to this day especially "Casey Junior", "Baby Mine" and "When I See An Elephant Fly". The music and songs have noteworthy variety to them and they are all handled very well. The animation was intended to be a little less advanced than the three previous Disney films before it (Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia), but it's still well done in its own right. The animation compliments the simple story that is being told well enough. There's no need to remake it and advance the animation further, it somehow works just fine as it is. Dumbo was intended to be a simpler film than the previous Disney animated features before it both with its animation and its story. And yet, it manages to equal and even top the three Disney films that came before it because it has the best balance of everything that made Disney films terrific to begin with. Even with a brief running time of just over an hour, Dumbo is more evidence that a great film which lasts just over an hour is preferable to a lousy film that lasts around two hours.

    Like 'Snow White,' this is one old Disney film that made me both cry and smile. I watched this film on a flight home from Dubai a few months ago after not having seen it since I was a child. Also as a child, I had a small cuddly toy of Dumbo that I was probably given when I was a baby. This film is rather sophisticated for its time due to its fluid animation and detailed backgrounds throughout. Pretty much all the songs are memorable. While the majority of them are uplifting (in particular 'Casey Jr' and 'Pink Elephants on Parade - their accompanying scenes also stand out very well,') the saddest one for me is 'Baby of Mine.' It made me cry when I was little and it still makes me cry now. Other than that, most of the characters are well-designed, especially Dumbo, Timothy Mouse, Dumbo's mother and the other female elephants; however I found the designs of the boys who taunted Dumbo and were beaten by his mother before she was deemed a mad elephant somewhat old-fashioned as well as the opening cards. Nevertheless, these aspects are forgivable for the film's era. The film's pace was relatively swift as well due to its length of just over an hour. Overall this is a timeless film that was worth re-visiting, albeit the tear-jerking 'Baby of Mine' sequence and a couple of old-fashioned aspects. 8/10.

    Dumbo is among the original Disney masterpieces, and masterpiece it is! My review is probably not necessary because most people have seen it by now, but I feel the need to include it because it is one of my favorite Disney Originals. Dumbo has the lovable circus characters, a funny little mouse and who can ever forget the Pink Elephants On Parade scene? I think Disney nailed this one by not making Dumbo a talking character because it makes his emotions on his face and in his actions all the more powerful. There is classic, circus-based soundtracks that add to the excitement, and of course the famous Baby Mine scene that was good enough to have been covered by many celebrities including Bette Midler. Classic family fun!

    Hands down, Dumbo will always be a Disney animation classic. The plot is rather simple, it's your basic Rudolph the Reindeer type of a story of a child who is a different to the point that makes them outcast amongst society. They get laugh at, discrimination, or mistreated. In this case, it's Dumbo's ears. It's a simple story of overcoming a difference that life threw at you and finding out how you can adapt to it. This may be a simple story but for me, it works for me and really, it's the characters that help to sell the story. Based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson, the story is about Jumbo JR who is cruelly mock to the point, that he was 'nickname' Dumbo. I love all his expressions are expressed through body language seeing as he doesn't talk but that comes from the fact that he's just a baby but even still, it works in the film and even without the dialogue, it is easy to pick up on Dumbo's emotions. His only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy (Edward Brophy). While the elephants don't like the mouse, Dumbo finds a paternal figure in him while his mother is locked up trying to protect him. While the movie loves to point out that this is a flying Elephant movie, in truth, Dumbo only flies in the last 10 minutes of the film. This is where the plot device comes into play. On his journey of self-discovery, Dumbo meets a group of Crows that teach Dumbo how to fly using a Magic Feather. It wasn't magic, as it was meant to give him a boost in courage. Now there has been a bunch of controversial about the black crows. In my opinion, I don't find it racist. The racism accusations around the crows usually centers somewhat around the fact that the leader crow is named, "Jim." It's making a joke out of the Jim Crow laws. The crow leader is the only white actor playing a crow. It's Cliff Edwards (the voice of Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio). I do like James Baskett as one of the crows. He will play Uncle Remus in Song of the South later on his career adding more to the controversial. Now as far as the crow debate goes, I never had any problems with them at all since in turn, they were integral to Dumbo's growth in the end. They were cool then and still are cool now. I guess I can see how they could be considered a bit racially insensitive, but even then it was portraying non-negative stereotypes, not negative ones. It wasn't like they were picking at watermelon slices, eating fried chicken or anything. Yes, the crows were portrayed akin to a very popular racial stereotype, "the Sambo." The Sambo is portrayed as a lazy, ignorant and enthusiastic bum. Like other racial stereotypes, such as The Mammy, the Tom and so on, they were popularized portrayals used in racist minstrel shows. The decision to name the lead crow Jim, in tandem with portraying the crows as Sambo stereotypes, makes the Crows more of an insult aimed at the civil rights movement and their efforts than innocent, plucky birds. The fact that Disney managed to disguise this racism in the form of innocent, plucky birds and marketed it makes it kind of insidious. Still, this band of crows that are cool, funny, clever and snarky. True, they start out a little cold hearted, but ultimately show to be very upright people underneath once they learn of Dumbo's plight and help him accomplish the impossible. In fact, taken in context, they're the only morally decent characters besides Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy. All the other "white" characters are portrayed as haughty, selfish, big headed, mean, ignorant, and hurtful. The gossipy elephants, the cruel circus children, the pompous ring leader, and the horrible clowns all in some way hurt or endanger Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo for self-gain. Plus, "When I See a Elephant Fly" is one of the cleverest, funniest, and catchiest songs in a Disney movie. The other good song was "Baby Mine", I have no regrets in admitting that every time the song comes on, I always cry. Despite what I may feel or whatever goes on with the family, it brings back to joy and comfort that I cry in a good way for loving my family. The only reason Dumbo's mother is in there in the first place is because she was trying to protect him, he can't really see her and they can't touch much. Add that to the song itself, then the fact that they show all the other baby animals in the circus asleep with their mother's. So yeah, Disney really know how to make a tearjerker when they want to. The other songs are pointless. The Pink Elephants on Parade scene scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid, and wasn't needed. Look Out for Mr. Stork is a catchy barber song. Still, dated and was a bit odd. If you're on birth control he won't find you. It's time for lemonade and cracker jacks Casey junior's back was bad. The animation was simplicity due to an animators strike. It was a deliberate pursuit due to that, as Pinoccohio and Fantasia were both flops at the time due to the work detail need for those films. If Dumbo wasn't a success, Disney would have closed down its studios since they lost a lot of money on those films. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. The animators wouldn't have return until the following year with Bambi. A number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns. Overall: Dumbo is emotional, atmosphere works fast paced, energetic and fun.

    Dumbo was released a year after Fantasia in 1941. This film is about a male elephant who was born with huge ears gets constantly made fun of by the other elephants in the circus, and the humans. After a boy goes too far into picking on Dumbo, his mother goes crazy, and gets locked up in a speedster place for crazy animals. Dumbo then gets put into an act where he falls a ridiculously high distance. Will he be able to shine in the circus? This film may not be as good as the previous three, it is still a good quality film. A bit on the short side, you way to know what happens next in the plot. The characters are all endearing; Dumbo has a clear personality (even though he does not talk) and you do feel sorry for him, the mouse that helps Dumbo is a cute and entertaining character. The crows are hilarious, and are definitely one of the best aspects of the movie, and the mother elephant is a typical mother who watches out for their kid. The songs are pretty good as well. "Baby Mine" is a slow, emotional, melodic tune, "When I See An Elephant Fly" is an upbeat track that makes you want to dance, and the score is very good as well. The animation is not as good as the previous 3 (because of its small budget), but it is still very interesting, and you could tell that they animated it, so it could stand out from the other films. The Pink Elephant scene is so cool. The way that they go about and move is so brilliant and is beyond words. This is ranked lower than the others because although it is a great film, it is a bit too short (a bit over an hour), and the fact that it does not leave much of an impact on you like the others do. I think that if the film was a bit longer, you would get a bit more invested into it. If you want to watch a short, entertaining family movie, Dumbo is the movie to go to.

    One of the shortest, the cheapest and simplest of Disney's animated films, Dumbo also happens to be one of the best. Stung by the fall-out from Fantasia, Disney returned to the story telling qualities that had made Pinocchio so successful. The simple story finds a baby elephant born with over sized ears who is separated from his mother when she's locked away for trying to protect him. Ostracised by his own kind and a figure of fun to the human public, Dumbo skulks away with his only friend, Timothy Q. Mouse. At the pinnacle of their adventure together, Dumbo discovers he has a talent, a talent that will change his life forever. And that's all there is to it. Only it's a picture that pulls on a myriad of emotions, it's funny, sad, exciting, and a great message movie as well. Delightful for the kids and ever watchable for adults of all ages, it's totally reliant on the animals for characterisations, where amazingly Dumbo is the one animal on show who doesn't speak! But it matters not, such is Disney when on top form, the animation is so great that just from Dumbo's expressions we know how he is feeling. Some wonderful tunes in here as well, including the quite beautiful "Baby Mine", while a surreal hallucination sequence (Pink Elephants On Parade) that plays out as Dumbo and Timothy accidentally drink liquor, is remarkable. There has been some balking at the black characterisations via some jaunty and funky crows, but they are immensely funny and for 1941 they be crafted with love and there's not a hint of being aware to racial stereotypes. Disney "A" League is Dumbo. 10/10

    Mere months before the U.S. entered World War II, Disney released its fourth major animated film, "Dumbo." At an unusually short 63 minutes, "Dumbo" tells a simple story of an elephant separated from his mother and picked on for his over-sized ears, who with the help of a circus mouse, must learn to love and believe in himself. "Dumbo" is really a short film padded by artistic sequences set to moving, Oscar-winning music. It opens with storks delivering babies to all the animals involved in a traveling circus. The kangaroo gets her baby, the tiger gets her babies and even the hippo gets her baby, but poor Mrs. Jumbo the elephant is left empty-handed. This sets the tone for the alienation both she and her soon-to-arrive child, Jumbo Jr., will experience throughout the film. When Mr. Stork (Sterling Holloway) eventually delivers Jumbo Jr., he and his mother become a laughing stock when the other lady elephants see his gigantic ears, nicknaming him "Dumbo." At one point at a circus stop, several spectators tease Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo goes mad with rage. The Ringmaster (Herman Bing) has her chained up in a train car and Dumbo is left to fend for himself Â— until he's befriended by Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy). Timothy thinks Dumbo's ears suit him well and believes he could be a star. He becomes Dumbo's life coach and only companion. The tender relationship between Dumbo and his mother (which would become a major dynamic in Disney's next film, "Bambi") is the emotional core of the film. Neither character speaks, and so the animators must focus on telling that story through the animation. At one point, a deflated Dumbo reunites with his confined mother and she cradles him in her trunk through the barred windows of the train car as the song "Baby Mine" plays, a timeless lullaby. Even Timothy sheds a tear. It's the most powerful scene in the film and testament to Disney's legacy. "Dumbo" has lots of unforgettable sequences peppered throughout that accompany the extremely basic narrative arc of how wide-eyed Dumbo gets separated from mom, feels shame and embarrassment for who he is and then accepts and believes in himself. Not all of them make sense and many are of questionable appropriateness, but they give "Dumbo" it's unique stamp among the Disney classics. "Song of the Roustabouts," for example, is a terrifying sequence in which the elephants, along with several African-American laborers, pitch the Big Top tent in the middle of a booming thunderstorm. The way light flashes and the wind whips water all about creates a fascinating mood, but the juxtaposition of circus animal labor and the presumed labor of free but unequal blacks makes it a strange scene to wedge into the beginning of the movie. "Pink Elephants on Parade" later in the movie is a visually daring and impressive sequence, but it's wildly inappropriate and arguably unnecessary. After Dumbo is made the butt of a joke in the clown act at the circus that proves successful, the clowns celebrate in their tent. Their liquor spikes the water bucket Dumbo and Timothy drink from and suddenly our main characters are having drunken hallucinations of color-changing elephants in a sequence clearly borrowing from the spirit of "Fantasia," which came out the year before. They wake up the next morning hanging from a tree, which leads Timothy to suppose Dumbo flew them up there in their drunken stupor. So, essentially, an accidental drunken episode leads to Dumbo's discovery of his amazing talent. At that point we meet the black crows, several jive-talking caricatures of African-Americans led by a character named Jim Crow (Cliff Edwards). Even if you assume the best of intentions on Disney's end, there's still a lot of insensitivity to be accounted for. At the same time, while they mock Dumbo at first, they apologize and are among few characters to be nice to him. Over time, these regrettable choices have given "Dumbo" its own unique flavor and helped it become a classic that stands on its own merits in Disney's canon, not a film that has simply been bolstered by the films made before and after it. Coming off "Fantasia" and "Pinocchio," "Dumbo" delivered the same emotional punch with less at its disposal in terms of story and visual detail. It's over in a flash, but "Dumbo" stands out with more than big ears. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com

    Dumbo (1941) **** (out of 4) One of Disney's greatest and cutest films centers on the elephant Dumbo, a small elephant with incredibly large ears. The large ears cause him to be picked on by many but with the help of his only friend, a mouse, he starts to be praised for what he can do. DUMBO is without question one of the studios greatest films and I think I'd say that it's also their very cutest. I think the characters here are among some of the best ever done for the studio and the screenplay is quite simple but it milks ever bit of emotion it can from the viewer. The most noticeable thing about watching this film today is how mean everyone in it is towards Dumbo. I'm sure most parents will be turned off by the behavior and I'm sure kids will be able to connect with Dumbo. There's no question that there's a message to be learned here and it's hard to believe that anyone could see this movie and not feel bad if they're the person picking on someone or get courage if they're the person being picked on. The story itself is quite simple and predictable but the characters from the leads to the supporting elephants to the crows are just so memorable and perfectly written. The songs here aren't quite as impressive as some of the other Disney films of this era but they're still pretty good. The animation is also quite simple but I thought this approach added for some beautiful scenes. DUMBO is clearly a film that works on so many levels and it remains one of the best of its kind.

    The classic Dumbo is a short movie about a cute little elephant who has self-image issues because of his big ears. It's a good lesson for kids everywhere - take what other people see as something bad about you and turn it into something positive. There's lots of animals in the animated movie, and we are introduced to most of them at the beginning of the movie. Storks are seen delivering babies everywhere - keeping with the old time explanation of "where do babies come from?" Other animals seen are bears, kangaroos, fish, tigers, giraffes, elephants, birds, monkeys, foxes, ostriches, snakes, horses, camels, zebras, hippos, gorillas, and even a mouse. Objects are person-fied in this movie. such as the train that talks. Animals are more like people then animals. The cut mouse who gives Dumbo his confidence, Mrs. Jumbo and her annoyingly rude companions, Mr. Stork. Comedy is written in a way that is funny for the adults as well as the children. I love when the stork is sitting on the cloud (every child imagines sitting on a cloud) and looking down on the earth at a map of the United States. The stork is constantly having to retrieve Dumbo as he sinks through the cloud. My favorite song is "When I See an Elephant Fly." Some negative elements: there is alcohol in this movie. We can see men drinking it, then later water is tainted with alcohol and the mouse and Dumbo are drunk. They have a wild vision...

    The 70th anniversary Blu-Ray of Dumbo is a must have for Disney fans and classic animation fans alike. The movie has been restored beautifully, showcasing the charming water-colored backgrounds, and the animation just pops off the screen in High-Def, like a living painting. Years ago when I seen a documentary about how Disney was using computers to clean up their classic animated films frame by frame I wasn't sure how the result would be, but the movie looks like it was just made, and not in a bad way. The sound is equally well restored, not over-blown but above and beyond most movies over 70 years old. A huge improvement over the DVD release from 2001. The movie if you are one of the few people on earth not familiar with the tale, is about a baby elephant with extremely large ears, named Jumbo Jr, but after being mocked the name "Dumbo" sticks. Despite this, with the help of his friend, a mouse, Timothy Q. Mouse, he soars above his bullies in more ways than one. Dumbo is presented in it's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and you can chose to watch it with black bars on the sides, or changing art panels that reflect each scene. There is also a Cine-Explore experience, with historians and animators taking you through the movie, a deleted scene and song, a documentary on the making of the film, a feturette called Celebrating Dumbo, and one on the ride at Disney Land, an audio commentary, a pair of classic Disney Shorts "The Flying Mouse" and "Elmer Elephant" (both in HD as are most the special features), and some games for the kids. A nice package for a classic film. RATING: MOVIE: 10 out of 10 AUDIO/VIDEO: 9 out of 10, 10 out of 10 EXTRAS: 9 out of 10

    I think it's pretty safe to say that we all have been in the same shoes as the main character of Walt Disney's 4th animated feature Dumbo (1941) at least once in our lives before. Anyone who had either seen this picture or had been picked on and/or bullied in school knows what it feels like to go through whatever the main character goes through in this film. The biggest reason why Dumbo has always been one of Disney's most timeless animated treasures is because so many of us can identify with the sadness and pain that the title character feels from all the unfortunate circumstances he's put under. Obviously, that isn't the only reason why Dumbo still holds up well after all these years, but more on that later. Our main character of this film is a baby elephant named Dumbo who is ridiculed by fellow circus animals and humans for his enormous ears. His mother Jumbo is the only elephant who is kind to Dumbo and willing to defend him. But when she gets into trouble for trying to protect Dumbo from harm, she gets locked up in a cage and Dumbo is now alone. That's when a circus mouse named Timothy Mouse comes in and becomes his only friend outside his mother. Timothy promises to do whatever he can to help Dumbo overcome his obstacle by making it into his strength. Right off the bat, I should say that I thought it was ingenious to make Dumbo's best friend a mouse, given that elephants are supposed to be afraid of mice for whatever reasons. I liked how even though sad things keep happening to Dumbo, he's the only elephant in the circus that has a mouse for a friend. That was a very clever idea on the writer's part. I also found Dumbo's relationship with his mom to be deeply touching and emotional. The filmmakers were wise to keep the dialogue out of the scenes between Dumbo and his mom and let the heartwarming images drawn by the Disney animators do the talking so to speak. Remember a brief scene early on when Jumbo wraps Dumbo's ears into a blanket and gently rocks him back and forth with her trunk? That was a cute little scene. You couldn't make this part of the movie better with dialogue since it manages to work perfectly well as it is. Speaking of great scenes, how about that infamous pink elephants sequence? Make all the arguments you like about how it contributes little to the plot and how a certain scene before it could send the wrong message to kids with Dumbo and Timothy Mouse accidentally consuming alcohol. That pink elephants scene is still a cool scene to watch. Considering the time in which it came out and all of the bright, colorful and surreal imagery being shown on screen, that scene was really ahead of its time in terms of its content. In regards to the controversy involving the crows that help Dumbo discover his true destiny and whether or not they are racist, I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about. In my opinion, they were just cool, free-spirited creatures who are just enjoying life. On top of that, the main leader of the group was voiced by a white person (Cliff Edwards to be precise, who's also famous for his voice-over work for Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio (1940)), so it makes the argument a tad less credible. Personally, nothing about these crows would've offended me if I was an African-American. If there was a scene that would have offended me if I were an African-American, it would be the Roustabouts song earlier in the film. I'm shocked that for all the controversy with the crows, how come no one seems to be offended by the Roustabouts scene? It clearly involves African-American slaves setting up the circus tents along with the circus animals. If that wasn't enough for this scene to repel any African-Americans, then some of the lyrics are. I swear I heard these very words somewhere in the songÂ… "We don't know when we get our pay, and when we do we throw our pay away". They're basically saying that they're enjoying being hard-working slaves and that they only enjoy living for that reason. I guess it just goes to show you how complicated race issues can really become, but I just think America was calling racism on the wrong part of the movie. In the tradition of the best Disney pictures, another one of the film's strengths is in its music and songs arranged by Frank Churchill, Oliver Wallace, and Ned Washington. Along with its wide range of music whether it's softer music or circus music, the film's songs are still memorable to this day especially "Casey Junior", "Baby Mine" and "When I See An Elephant Fly". The music and songs have noteworthy variety to them and they are all handled very well. The animation was intended to be a little less advanced than the three previous Disney films before it (Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia), but it's still well done in its own right. The animation compliments the simple story that is being told well enough. There's no need to remake it and advance the animation further, it somehow works just fine as it is. Dumbo was intended to be a simpler film than the previous Disney animated features before it both with its animation and its story. And yet, it manages to equal and even top the three Disney films that came before it because it has the best balance of everything that made Disney films terrific to begin with. Even with a brief running time of just over an hour, Dumbo is more evidence that a great film which lasts just over an hour is preferable to a lousy film that lasts around two hours.

    Like 'Snow White,' this is one old Disney film that made me both cry and smile. I watched this film on a flight home from Dubai a few months ago after not having seen it since I was a child. Also as a child, I had a small cuddly toy of Dumbo that I was probably given when I was a baby. This film is rather sophisticated for its time due to its fluid animation and detailed backgrounds throughout. Pretty much all the songs are memorable. While the majority of them are uplifting (in particular 'Casey Jr' and 'Pink Elephants on Parade - their accompanying scenes also stand out very well,') the saddest one for me is 'Baby of Mine.' It made me cry when I was little and it still makes me cry now. Other than that, most of the characters are well-designed, especially Dumbo, Timothy Mouse, Dumbo's mother and the other female elephants; however I found the designs of the boys who taunted Dumbo and were beaten by his mother before she was deemed a mad elephant somewhat old-fashioned as well as the opening cards. Nevertheless, these aspects are forgivable for the film's era. The film's pace was relatively swift as well due to its length of just over an hour. Overall this is a timeless film that was worth re-visiting, albeit the tear-jerking 'Baby of Mine' sequence and a couple of old-fashioned aspects. 8/10.

    Dumbo is among the original Disney masterpieces, and masterpiece it is! My review is probably not necessary because most people have seen it by now, but I feel the need to include it because it is one of my favorite Disney Originals. Dumbo has the lovable circus characters, a funny little mouse and who can ever forget the Pink Elephants On Parade scene? I think Disney nailed this one by not making Dumbo a talking character because it makes his emotions on his face and in his actions all the more powerful. There is classic, circus-based soundtracks that add to the excitement, and of course the famous Baby Mine scene that was good enough to have been covered by many celebrities including Bette Midler. Classic family fun!

    Hands down, Dumbo will always be a Disney animation classic. The plot is rather simple, it's your basic Rudolph the Reindeer type of a story of a child who is a different to the point that makes them outcast amongst society. They get laugh at, discrimination, or mistreated. In this case, it's Dumbo's ears. It's a simple story of overcoming a difference that life threw at you and finding out how you can adapt to it. This may be a simple story but for me, it works for me and really, it's the characters that help to sell the story. Based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson, the story is about Jumbo JR who is cruelly mock to the point, that he was 'nickname' Dumbo. I love all his expressions are expressed through body language seeing as he doesn't talk but that comes from the fact that he's just a baby but even still, it works in the film and even without the dialogue, it is easy to pick up on Dumbo's emotions. His only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy (Edward Brophy). While the elephants don't like the mouse, Dumbo finds a paternal figure in him while his mother is locked up trying to protect him. While the movie loves to point out that this is a flying Elephant movie, in truth, Dumbo only flies in the last 10 minutes of the film. This is where the plot device comes into play. On his journey of self-discovery, Dumbo meets a group of Crows that teach Dumbo how to fly using a Magic Feather. It wasn't magic, as it was meant to give him a boost in courage. Now there has been a bunch of controversial about the black crows. In my opinion, I don't find it racist. The racism accusations around the crows usually centers somewhat around the fact that the leader crow is named, "Jim." It's making a joke out of the Jim Crow laws. The crow leader is the only white actor playing a crow. It's Cliff Edwards (the voice of Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio). I do like James Baskett as one of the crows. He will play Uncle Remus in Song of the South later on his career adding more to the controversial. Now as far as the crow debate goes, I never had any problems with them at all since in turn, they were integral to Dumbo's growth in the end. They were cool then and still are cool now. I guess I can see how they could be considered a bit racially insensitive, but even then it was portraying non-negative stereotypes, not negative ones. It wasn't like they were picking at watermelon slices, eating fried chicken or anything. Yes, the crows were portrayed akin to a very popular racial stereotype, "the Sambo." The Sambo is portrayed as a lazy, ignorant and enthusiastic bum. Like other racial stereotypes, such as The Mammy, the Tom and so on, they were popularized portrayals used in racist minstrel shows. The decision to name the lead crow Jim, in tandem with portraying the crows as Sambo stereotypes, makes the Crows more of an insult aimed at the civil rights movement and their efforts than innocent, plucky birds. The fact that Disney managed to disguise this racism in the form of innocent, plucky birds and marketed it makes it kind of insidious. Still, this band of crows that are cool, funny, clever and snarky. True, they start out a little cold hearted, but ultimately show to be very upright people underneath once they learn of Dumbo's plight and help him accomplish the impossible. In fact, taken in context, they're the only morally decent characters besides Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy. All the other "white" characters are portrayed as haughty, selfish, big headed, mean, ignorant, and hurtful. The gossipy elephants, the cruel circus children, the pompous ring leader, and the horrible clowns all in some way hurt or endanger Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo for self-gain. Plus, "When I See a Elephant Fly" is one of the cleverest, funniest, and catchiest songs in a Disney movie. The other good song was "Baby Mine", I have no regrets in admitting that every time the song comes on, I always cry. Despite what I may feel or whatever goes on with the family, it brings back to joy and comfort that I cry in a good way for loving my family. The only reason Dumbo's mother is in there in the first place is because she was trying to protect him, he can't really see her and they can't touch much. Add that to the song itself, then the fact that they show all the other baby animals in the circus asleep with their mother's. So yeah, Disney really know how to make a tearjerker when they want to. The other songs are pointless. The Pink Elephants on Parade scene scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid, and wasn't needed. Look Out for Mr. Stork is a catchy barber song. Still, dated and was a bit odd. If you're on birth control he won't find you. It's time for lemonade and cracker jacks Casey junior's back was bad. The animation was simplicity due to an animators strike. It was a deliberate pursuit due to that, as Pinoccohio and Fantasia were both flops at the time due to the work detail need for those films. If Dumbo wasn't a success, Disney would have closed down its studios since they lost a lot of money on those films. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. The animators wouldn't have return until the following year with Bambi. A number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns. Overall: Dumbo is emotional, atmosphere works fast paced, energetic and fun.

    Dumbo was released a year after Fantasia in 1941. This film is about a male elephant who was born with huge ears gets constantly made fun of by the other elephants in the circus, and the humans. After a boy goes too far into picking on Dumbo, his mother goes crazy, and gets locked up in a speedster place for crazy animals. Dumbo then gets put into an act where he falls a ridiculously high distance. Will he be able to shine in the circus? This film may not be as good as the previous three, it is still a good quality film. A bit on the short side, you way to know what happens next in the plot. The characters are all endearing; Dumbo has a clear personality (even though he does not talk) and you do feel sorry for him, the mouse that helps Dumbo is a cute and entertaining character. The crows are hilarious, and are definitely one of the best aspects of the movie, and the mother elephant is a typical mother who watches out for their kid. The songs are pretty good as well. "Baby Mine" is a slow, emotional, melodic tune, "When I See An Elephant Fly" is an upbeat track that makes you want to dance, and the score is very good as well. The animation is not as good as the previous 3 (because of its small budget), but it is still very interesting, and you could tell that they animated it, so it could stand out from the other films. The Pink Elephant scene is so cool. The way that they go about and move is so brilliant and is beyond words. This is ranked lower than the others because although it is a great film, it is a bit too short (a bit over an hour), and the fact that it does not leave much of an impact on you like the others do. I think that if the film was a bit longer, you would get a bit more invested into it. If you want to watch a short, entertaining family movie, Dumbo is the movie to go to.

    One of the shortest, the cheapest and simplest of Disney's animated films, Dumbo also happens to be one of the best. Stung by the fall-out from Fantasia, Disney returned to the story telling qualities that had made Pinocchio so successful. The simple story finds a baby elephant born with over sized ears who is separated from his mother when she's locked away for trying to protect him. Ostracised by his own kind and a figure of fun to the human public, Dumbo skulks away with his only friend, Timothy Q. Mouse. At the pinnacle of their adventure together, Dumbo discovers he has a talent, a talent that will change his life forever. And that's all there is to it. Only it's a picture that pulls on a myriad of emotions, it's funny, sad, exciting, and a great message movie as well. Delightful for the kids and ever watchable for adults of all ages, it's totally reliant on the animals for characterisations, where amazingly Dumbo is the one animal on show who doesn't speak! But it matters not, such is Disney when on top form, the animation is so great that just from Dumbo's expressions we know how he is feeling. Some wonderful tunes in here as well, including the quite beautiful "Baby Mine", while a surreal hallucination sequence (Pink Elephants On Parade) that plays out as Dumbo and Timothy accidentally drink liquor, is remarkable. There has been some balking at the black characterisations via some jaunty and funky crows, but they are immensely funny and for 1941 they be crafted with love and there's not a hint of being aware to racial stereotypes. Disney "A" League is Dumbo. 10/10

    Mere months before the U.S. entered World War II, Disney released its fourth major animated film, "Dumbo." At an unusually short 63 minutes, "Dumbo" tells a simple story of an elephant separated from his mother and picked on for his over-sized ears, who with the help of a circus mouse, must learn to love and believe in himself. "Dumbo" is really a short film padded by artistic sequences set to moving, Oscar-winning music. It opens with storks delivering babies to all the animals involved in a traveling circus. The kangaroo gets her baby, the tiger gets her babies and even the hippo gets her baby, but poor Mrs. Jumbo the elephant is left empty-handed. This sets the tone for the alienation both she and her soon-to-arrive child, Jumbo Jr., will experience throughout the film. When Mr. Stork (Sterling Holloway) eventually delivers Jumbo Jr., he and his mother become a laughing stock when the other lady elephants see his gigantic ears, nicknaming him "Dumbo." At one point at a circus stop, several spectators tease Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo goes mad with rage. The Ringmaster (Herman Bing) has her chained up in a train car and Dumbo is left to fend for himself Â— until he's befriended by Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy). Timothy thinks Dumbo's ears suit him well and believes he could be a star. He becomes Dumbo's life coach and only companion. The tender relationship between Dumbo and his mother (which would become a major dynamic in Disney's next film, "Bambi") is the emotional core of the film. Neither character speaks, and so the animators must focus on telling that story through the animation. At one point, a deflated Dumbo reunites with his confined mother and she cradles him in her trunk through the barred windows of the train car as the song "Baby Mine" plays, a timeless lullaby. Even Timothy sheds a tear. It's the most powerful scene in the film and testament to Disney's legacy. "Dumbo" has lots of unforgettable sequences peppered throughout that accompany the extremely basic narrative arc of how wide-eyed Dumbo gets separated from mom, feels shame and embarrassment for who he is and then accepts and believes in himself. Not all of them make sense and many are of questionable appropriateness, but they give "Dumbo" it's unique stamp among the Disney classics. "Song of the Roustabouts," for example, is a terrifying sequence in which the elephants, along with several African-American laborers, pitch the Big Top tent in the middle of a booming thunderstorm. The way light flashes and the wind whips water all about creates a fascinating mood, but the juxtaposition of circus animal labor and the presumed labor of free but unequal blacks makes it a strange scene to wedge into the beginning of the movie. "Pink Elephants on Parade" later in the movie is a visually daring and impressive sequence, but it's wildly inappropriate and arguably unnecessary. After Dumbo is made the butt of a joke in the clown act at the circus that proves successful, the clowns celebrate in their tent. Their liquor spikes the water bucket Dumbo and Timothy drink from and suddenly our main characters are having drunken hallucinations of color-changing elephants in a sequence clearly borrowing from the spirit of "Fantasia," which came out the year before. They wake up the next morning hanging from a tree, which leads Timothy to suppose Dumbo flew them up there in their drunken stupor. So, essentially, an accidental drunken episode leads to Dumbo's discovery of his amazing talent. At that point we meet the black crows, several jive-talking caricatures of African-Americans led by a character named Jim Crow (Cliff Edwards). Even if you assume the best of intentions on Disney's end, there's still a lot of insensitivity to be accounted for. At the same time, while they mock Dumbo at first, they apologize and are among few characters to be nice to him. Over time, these regrettable choices have given "Dumbo" its own unique flavor and helped it become a classic that stands on its own merits in Disney's canon, not a film that has simply been bolstered by the films made before and after it. Coming off "Fantasia" and "Pinocchio," "Dumbo" delivered the same emotional punch with less at its disposal in terms of story and visual detail. It's over in a flash, but "Dumbo" stands out with more than big ears. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com

    Dumbo (1941) **** (out of 4) One of Disney's greatest and cutest films centers on the elephant Dumbo, a small elephant with incredibly large ears. The large ears cause him to be picked on by many but with the help of his only friend, a mouse, he starts to be praised for what he can do. DUMBO is without question one of the studios greatest films and I think I'd say that it's also their very cutest. I think the characters here are among some of the best ever done for the studio and the screenplay is quite simple but it milks ever bit of emotion it can from the viewer. The most noticeable thing about watching this film today is how mean everyone in it is towards Dumbo. I'm sure most parents will be turned off by the behavior and I'm sure kids will be able to connect with Dumbo. There's no question that there's a message to be learned here and it's hard to believe that anyone could see this movie and not feel bad if they're the person picking on someone or get courage if they're the person being picked on. The story itself is quite simple and predictable but the characters from the leads to the supporting elephants to the crows are just so memorable and perfectly written. The songs here aren't quite as impressive as some of the other Disney films of this era but they're still pretty good. The animation is also quite simple but I thought this approach added for some beautiful scenes. DUMBO is clearly a film that works on so many levels and it remains one of the best of its kind.

    The classic Dumbo is a short movie about a cute little elephant who has self-image issues because of his big ears. It's a good lesson for kids everywhere - take what other people see as something bad about you and turn it into something positive. There's lots of animals in the animated movie, and we are introduced to most of them at the beginning of the movie. Storks are seen delivering babies everywhere - keeping with the old time explanation of "where do babies come from?" Other animals seen are bears, kangaroos, fish, tigers, giraffes, elephants, birds, monkeys, foxes, ostriches, snakes, horses, camels, zebras, hippos, gorillas, and even a mouse. Objects are person-fied in this movie. such as the train that talks. Animals are more like people then animals. The cut mouse who gives Dumbo his confidence, Mrs. Jumbo and her annoyingly rude companions, Mr. Stork. Comedy is written in a way that is funny for the adults as well as the children. I love when the stork is sitting on the cloud (every child imagines sitting on a cloud) and looking down on the earth at a map of the United States. The stork is constantly having to retrieve Dumbo as he sinks through the cloud. My favorite song is "When I See an Elephant Fly." Some negative elements: there is alcohol in this movie. We can see men drinking it, then later water is tainted with alcohol and the mouse and Dumbo are drunk. They have a wild vision...

    The 70th anniversary Blu-Ray of Dumbo is a must have for Disney fans and classic animation fans alike. The movie has been restored beautifully, showcasing the charming water-colored backgrounds, and the animation just pops off the screen in High-Def, like a living painting. Years ago when I seen a documentary about how Disney was using computers to clean up their classic animated films frame by frame I wasn't sure how the result would be, but the movie looks like it was just made, and not in a bad way. The sound is equally well restored, not over-blown but above and beyond most movies over 70 years old. A huge improvement over the DVD release from 2001. The movie if you are one of the few people on earth not familiar with the tale, is about a baby elephant with extremely large ears, named Jumbo Jr, but after being mocked the name "Dumbo" sticks. Despite this, with the help of his friend, a mouse, Timothy Q. Mouse, he soars above his bullies in more ways than one. Dumbo is presented in it's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and you can chose to watch it with black bars on the sides, or changing art panels that reflect each scene. There is also a Cine-Explore experience, with historians and animators taking you through the movie, a deleted scene and song, a documentary on the making of the film, a feturette called Celebrating Dumbo, and one on the ride at Disney Land, an audio commentary, a pair of classic Disney Shorts "The Flying Mouse" and "Elmer Elephant" (both in HD as are most the special features), and some games for the kids.

    I think it's pretty safe to say that we all have been in the same shoes as the main character of Walt Disney's 4th animated feature Dumbo (1941) at least once in our lives before. Anyone who had either seen this picture or had been picked on and/or bullied in school knows what it feels like to go through whatever the main character goes through in this film. The biggest reason why Dumbo has always been one of Disney's most timeless animated treasures is because so many of us can identify with the sadness and pain that the title character feels from all the unfortunate circumstances he's put under. Obviously, that isn't the only reason why Dumbo still holds up well after all these years, but more on that later. Our main character of this film is a baby elephant named Dumbo who is ridiculed by fellow circus animals and humans for his enormous ears. His mother Jumbo is the only elephant who is kind to Dumbo and willing to defend him. But when she gets into trouble for trying to protect Dumbo from harm, she gets locked up in a cage and Dumbo is now alone. That's when a circus mouse named Timothy Mouse comes in and becomes his only friend outside his mother. Timothy promises to do whatever he can to help Dumbo overcome his obstacle by making it into his strength. Right off the bat, I should say that I thought it was ingenious to make Dumbo's best friend a mouse, given that elephants are supposed to be afraid of mice for whatever reasons. I liked how even though sad things keep happening to Dumbo, he's the only elephant in the circus that has a mouse for a friend. That was a very clever idea on the writer's part. I also found Dumbo's relationship with his mom to be deeply touching and emotional. The filmmakers were wise to keep the dialogue out of the scenes between Dumbo and his mom and let the heartwarming images drawn by the Disney animators do the talking so to speak. Remember a brief scene early on when Jumbo wraps Dumbo's ears into a blanket and gently rocks him back and forth with her trunk? That was a cute little scene. You couldn't make this part of the movie better with dialogue since it manages to work perfectly well as it is. Speaking of great scenes, how about that infamous pink elephants sequence? Make all the arguments you like about how it contributes little to the plot and how a certain scene before it could send the wrong message to kids with Dumbo and Timothy Mouse accidentally consuming alcohol. That pink elephants scene is still a cool scene to watch. Considering the time in which it came out and all of the bright, colorful and surreal imagery being shown on screen, that scene was really ahead of its time in terms of its content. In regards to the controversy involving the crows that help Dumbo discover his true destiny and whether or not they are racist, I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about. In my opinion, they were just cool, free-spirited creatures who are just enjoying life. On top of that, the main leader of the group was voiced by a white person (Cliff Edwards to be precise, who's also famous for his voice-over work for Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio (1940)), so it makes the argument a tad less credible. Personally, nothing about these crows would've offended me if I was an African-American. If there was a scene that would have offended me if I were an African-American, it would be the Roustabouts song earlier in the film. I'm shocked that for all the controversy with the crows, how come no one seems to be offended by the Roustabouts scene? It clearly involves African-American slaves setting up the circus tents along with the circus animals. If that wasn't enough for this scene to repel any African-Americans, then some of the lyrics are. I swear I heard these very words somewhere in the songÂ… "We don't know when we get our pay, and when we do we throw our pay away". They're basically saying that they're enjoying being hard-working slaves and that they only enjoy living for that reason. I guess it just goes to show you how complicated race issues can really become, but I just think America was calling racism on the wrong part of the movie. In the tradition of the best Disney pictures, another one of the film's strengths is in its music and songs arranged by Frank Churchill, Oliver Wallace, and Ned Washington. Along with its wide range of music whether it's softer music or circus music, the film's songs are still memorable to this day especially "Casey Junior", "Baby Mine" and "When I See An Elephant Fly". The music and songs have noteworthy variety to them and they are all handled very well. The animation was intended to be a little less advanced than the three previous Disney films before it (Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia), but it's still well done in its own right. The animation compliments the simple story that is being told well enough. There's no need to remake it and advance the animation further, it somehow works just fine as it is. Dumbo was intended to be a simpler film than the previous Disney animated features before it both with its animation and its story. And yet, it manages to equal and even top the three Disney films that came before it because it has the best balance of everything that made Disney films terrific to begin with. Even with a brief running time of just over an hour, Dumbo is more evidence that a great film which lasts just over an hour is preferable to a lousy film that lasts around two hours.

    Like 'Snow White,' this is one old Disney film that made me both cry and smile. I watched this film on a flight home from Dubai a few months ago after not having seen it since I was a child. Also as a child, I had a small cuddly toy of Dumbo that I was probably given when I was a baby. This film is rather sophisticated for its time due to its fluid animation and detailed backgrounds throughout. Pretty much all the songs are memorable. While the majority of them are uplifting (in particular 'Casey Jr' and 'Pink Elephants on Parade - their accompanying scenes also stand out very well,') the saddest one for me is 'Baby of Mine.' It made me cry when I was little and it still makes me cry now. Other than that, most of the characters are well-designed, especially Dumbo, Timothy Mouse, Dumbo's mother and the other female elephants; however I found the designs of the boys who taunted Dumbo and were beaten by his mother before she was deemed a mad elephant somewhat old-fashioned as well as the opening cards. Nevertheless, these aspects are forgivable for the film's era. The film's pace was relatively swift as well due to its length of just over an hour. Overall this is a timeless film that was worth re-visiting, albeit the tear-jerking 'Baby of Mine' sequence and a couple of old-fashioned aspects. 8/10.

    Dumbo is among the original Disney masterpieces, and masterpiece it is! My review is probably not necessary because most people have seen it by now, but I feel the need to include it because it is one of my favorite Disney Originals. Dumbo has the lovable circus characters, a funny little mouse and who can ever forget the Pink Elephants On Parade scene? I think Disney nailed this one by not making Dumbo a talking character because it makes his emotions on his face and in his actions all the more powerful. There is classic, circus-based soundtracks that add to the excitement, and of course the famous Baby Mine scene that was good enough to have been covered by many celebrities including Bette Midler. Classic family fun!

    Hands down, Dumbo will always be a Disney animation classic. The plot is rather simple, it's your basic Rudolph the Reindeer type of a story of a child who is a different to the point that makes them outcast amongst society. They get laugh at, discrimination, or mistreated. In this case, it's Dumbo's ears. It's a simple story of overcoming a difference that life threw at you and finding out how you can adapt to it. This may be a simple story but for me, it works for me and really, it's the characters that help to sell the story. Based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson, the story is about Jumbo JR who is cruelly mock to the point, that he was 'nickname' Dumbo. I love all his expressions are expressed through body language seeing as he doesn't talk but that comes from the fact that he's just a baby but even still, it works in the film and even without the dialogue, it is easy to pick up on Dumbo's emotions. His only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy (Edward Brophy). While the elephants don't like the mouse, Dumbo finds a paternal figure in him while his mother is locked up trying to protect him. While the movie loves to point out that this is a flying Elephant movie, in truth, Dumbo only flies in the last 10 minutes of the film. This is where the plot device comes into play. On his journey of self-discovery, Dumbo meets a group of Crows that teach Dumbo how to fly using a Magic Feather. It wasn't magic, as it was meant to give him a boost in courage. Now there has been a bunch of controversial about the black crows. In my opinion, I don't find it racist. The racism accusations around the crows usually centers somewhat around the fact that the leader crow is named, "Jim." It's making a joke out of the Jim Crow laws. The crow leader is the only white actor playing a crow. It's Cliff Edwards (the voice of Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio). I do like James Baskett as one of the crows. He will play Uncle Remus in Song of the South later on his career adding more to the controversial. Now as far as the crow debate goes, I never had any problems with them at all since in turn, they were integral to Dumbo's growth in the end. They were cool then and still are cool now. I guess I can see how they could be considered a bit racially insensitive, but even then it was portraying non-negative stereotypes, not negative ones. It wasn't like they were picking at watermelon slices, eating fried chicken or anything. Yes, the crows were portrayed akin to a very popular racial stereotype, "the Sambo." The Sambo is portrayed as a lazy, ignorant and enthusiastic bum. Like other racial stereotypes, such as The Mammy, the Tom and so on, they were popularized portrayals used in racist minstrel shows. The decision to name the lead crow Jim, in tandem with portraying the crows as Sambo stereotypes, makes the Crows more of an insult aimed at the civil rights movement and their efforts than innocent, plucky birds. The fact that Disney managed to disguise this racism in the form of innocent, plucky birds and marketed it makes it kind of insidious. Still, this band of crows that are cool, funny, clever and snarky. True, they start out a little cold hearted, but ultimately show to be very upright people underneath once they learn of Dumbo's plight and help him accomplish the impossible. In fact, taken in context, they're the only morally decent characters besides Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy. All the other "white" characters are portrayed as haughty, selfish, big headed, mean, ignorant, and hurtful. The gossipy elephants, the cruel circus children, the pompous ring leader, and the horrible clowns all in some way hurt or endanger Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo for self-gain. Plus, "When I See a Elephant Fly" is one of the cleverest, funniest, and catchiest songs in a Disney movie. The other good song was "Baby Mine", I have no regrets in admitting that every time the song comes on, I always cry. Despite what I may feel or whatever goes on with the family, it brings back to joy and comfort that I cry in a good way for loving my family. The only reason Dumbo's mother is in there in the first place is because she was trying to protect him, he can't really see her and they can't touch much. Add that to the song itself, then the fact that they show all the other baby animals in the circus asleep with their mother's. So yeah, Disney really know how to make a tearjerker when they want to. The other songs are pointless. The Pink Elephants on Parade scene scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid, and wasn't needed. Look Out for Mr. Stork is a catchy barber song. Still, dated and was a bit odd. If you're on birth control he won't find you. It's time for lemonade and cracker jacks Casey junior's back was bad. The animation was simplicity due to an animators strike. It was a deliberate pursuit due to that, as Pinoccohio and Fantasia were both flops at the time due to the work detail need for those films. If Dumbo wasn't a success, Disney would have closed down its studios since they lost a lot of money on those films. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. The animators wouldn't have return until the following year with Bambi. A number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns. Overall: Dumbo is emotional, atmosphere works fast paced, energetic and fun.

    Dumbo was released a year after Fantasia in 1941. This film is about a male elephant who was born with huge ears gets constantly made fun of by the other elephants in the circus, and the humans. After a boy goes too far into picking on Dumbo, his mother goes crazy, and gets locked up in a speedster place for crazy animals. Dumbo then gets put into an act where he falls a ridiculously high distance. Will he be able to shine in the circus? This film may not be as good as the previous three, it is still a good quality film. A bit on the short side, you way to know what happens next in the plot. The characters are all endearing; Dumbo has a clear personality (even though he does not talk) and you do feel sorry for him, the mouse that helps Dumbo is a cute and entertaining character. The crows are hilarious, and are definitely one of the best aspects of the movie, and the mother elephant is a typical mother who watches out for their kid. The songs are pretty good as well. "Baby Mine" is a slow, emotional, melodic tune, "When I See An Elephant Fly" is an upbeat track that makes you want to dance, and the score is very good as well. The animation is not as good as the previous 3 (because of its small budget), but it is still very interesting, and you could tell that they animated it, so it could stand out from the other films. The Pink Elephant scene is so cool. The way that they go about and move is so brilliant and is beyond words. This is ranked lower than the others because although it is a great film, it is a bit too short (a bit over an hour), and the fact that it does not leave much of an impact on you like the others do. I think that if the film was a bit longer, you would get a bit more invested into it. If you want to watch a short, entertaining family movie, Dumbo is the movie to go to.

    One of the shortest, the cheapest and simplest of Disney's animated films, Dumbo also happens to be one of the best. Stung by the fall-out from Fantasia, Disney returned to the story telling qualities that had made Pinocchio so successful. The simple story finds a baby elephant born with over sized ears who is separated from his mother when she's locked away for trying to protect him. Ostracised by his own kind and a figure of fun to the human public, Dumbo skulks away with his only friend, Timothy Q. Mouse. At the pinnacle of their adventure together, Dumbo discovers he has a talent, a talent that will change his life forever. And that's all there is to it. Only it's a picture that pulls on a myriad of emotions, it's funny, sad, exciting, and a great message movie as well. Delightful for the kids and ever watchable for adults of all ages, it's totally reliant on the animals for characterisations, where amazingly Dumbo is the one animal on show who doesn't speak! But it matters not, such is Disney when on top form, the animation is so great that just from Dumbo's expressions we know how he is feeling. Some wonderful tunes in here as well, including the quite beautiful "Baby Mine", while a surreal hallucination sequence (Pink Elephants On Parade) that plays out as Dumbo and Timothy accidentally drink liquor, is remarkable. There has been some balking at the black characterisations via some jaunty and funky crows, but they are immensely funny and for 1941 they be crafted with love and there's not a hint of being aware to racial stereotypes. Disney "A" League is Dumbo. 10/10

    Mere months before the U.S. entered World War II, Disney released its fourth major animated film, "Dumbo." At an unusually short 63 minutes, "Dumbo" tells a simple story of an elephant separated from his mother and picked on for his over-sized ears, who with the help of a circus mouse, must learn to love and believe in himself. "Dumbo" is really a short film padded by artistic sequences set to moving, Oscar-winning music. It opens with storks delivering babies to all the animals involved in a traveling circus. The kangaroo gets her baby, the tiger gets her babies and even the hippo gets her baby, but poor Mrs. Jumbo the elephant is left empty-handed. This sets the tone for the alienation both she and her soon-to-arrive child, Jumbo Jr., will experience throughout the film. When Mr. Stork (Sterling Holloway) eventually delivers Jumbo Jr., he and his mother become a laughing stock when the other lady elephants see his gigantic ears, nicknaming him "Dumbo." At one point at a circus stop, several spectators tease Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo goes mad with rage. The Ringmaster (Herman Bing) has her chained up in a train car and Dumbo is left to fend for himself Â— until he's befriended by Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy). Timothy thinks Dumbo's ears suit him well and believes he could be a star. He becomes Dumbo's life coach and only companion. The tender relationship between Dumbo and his mother (which would become a major dynamic in Disney's next film, "Bambi") is the emotional core of the film. Neither character speaks, and so the animators must focus on telling that story through the animation. At one point, a deflated Dumbo reunites with his confined mother and she cradles him in her trunk through the barred windows of the train car as the song "Baby Mine" plays, a timeless lullaby. Even Timothy sheds a tear. It's the most powerful scene in the film and testament to Disney's legacy. "Dumbo" has lots of unforgettable sequences peppered throughout that accompany the extremely basic narrative arc of how wide-eyed Dumbo gets separated from mom, feels shame and embarrassment for who he is and then accepts and believes in himself. Not all of them make sense and many are of questionable appropriateness, but they give "Dumbo" it's unique stamp among the Disney classics. "Song of the Roustabouts," for example, is a terrifying sequence in which the elephants, along with several African-American laborers, pitch the Big Top tent in the middle of a booming thunderstorm. The way light flashes and the wind whips water all about creates a fascinating mood, but the juxtaposition of circus animal labor and the presumed labor of free but unequal blacks makes it a strange scene to wedge into the beginning of the movie. "Pink Elephants on Parade" later in the movie is a visually daring and impressive sequence, but it's wildly inappropriate and arguably unnecessary. After Dumbo is made the butt of a joke in the clown act at the circus that proves successful, the clowns celebrate in their tent. Their liquor spikes the water bucket Dumbo and Timothy drink from and suddenly our main characters are having drunken hallucinations of color-changing elephants in a sequence clearly borrowing from the spirit of "Fantasia," which came out the year before. They wake up the next morning hanging from a tree, which leads Timothy to suppose Dumbo flew them up there in their drunken stupor. So, essentially, an accidental drunken episode leads to Dumbo's discovery of his amazing talent. At that point we meet the black crows, several jive-talking caricatures of African-Americans led by a character named Jim Crow (Cliff Edwards). Even if you assume the best of intentions on Disney's end, there's still a lot of insensitivity to be accounted for. At the same time, while they mock Dumbo at first, they apologize and are among few characters to be nice to him. Over time, these regrettable choices have given "Dumbo" its own unique flavor and helped it become a classic that stands on its own merits in Disney's canon, not a film that has simply been bolstered by the films made before and after it. Coming off "Fantasia" and "Pinocchio," "Dumbo" delivered the same emotional punch with less at its disposal in terms of story and visual detail. It's over in a flash, but "Dumbo" stands out with more than big ears. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com

    Dumbo (1941) **** (out of 4) One of Disney's greatest and cutest films centers on the elephant Dumbo, a small elephant with incredibly large ears. The large ears cause him to be picked on by many but with the help of his only friend, a mouse, he starts to be praised for what he can do. DUMBO is without question one of the studios greatest films and I think I'd say that it's also their very cutest. I think the characters here are among some of the best ever done for the studio and the screenplay is quite simple but it milks ever bit of emotion it can from the viewer. The most noticeable thing about watching this film today is how mean everyone in it is towards Dumbo. I'm sure most parents will be turned off by the behavior and I'm sure kids will be able to connect with Dumbo. There's no question that there's a message to be learned here and it's hard to believe that anyone could see this movie and not feel bad if they're the person picking on someone or get courage if they're the person being picked on. The story itself is quite simple and predictable but the characters from the leads to the supporting elephants to the crows are just so memorable and perfectly written. The songs here aren't quite as impressive as some of the other Disney films of this era but they're still pretty good. The animation is also quite simple but I thought this approach added for some beautiful scenes. DUMBO is clearly a film that works on so many levels and it remains one of the best of its kind.

    The classic Dumbo is a short movie about a cute little elephant who has self-image issues because of his big ears. It's a good lesson for kids everywhere - take what other people see as something bad about you and turn it into something positive. There's lots of animals in the animated movie, and we are introduced to most of them at the beginning of the movie. Storks are seen delivering babies everywhere - keeping with the old time explanation of "where do babies come from?" Other animals seen are bears, kangaroos, fish, tigers, giraffes, elephants, birds, monkeys, foxes, ostriches, snakes, horses, camels, zebras, hippos, gorillas, and even a mouse. Objects are person-fied in this movie. such as the train that talks. Animals are more like people then animals. The cut mouse who gives Dumbo his confidence, Mrs. Jumbo and her annoyingly rude companions, Mr. Stork. Comedy is written in a way that is funny for the adults as well as the children. I love when the stork is sitting on the cloud (every child imagines sitting on a cloud) and looking down on the earth at a map of the United States. The stork is constantly having to retrieve Dumbo as he sinks through the cloud. My favorite song is "When I See an Elephant Fly." Some negative elements: there is alcohol in this movie. We can see men drinking it, then later water is tainted with alcohol and the mouse and Dumbo are drunk. They have a wild vision...
