    After reading most of the reviews, I felt there weren't any more superlatives I could add. But then I ran across two decidedly negative reviews and feel the need to make a few comments -- and also add a key item you might need when watching the film. Mr Wallis tells us the ending is violent. My question is, "What film were you watching"? I don't think this is too much of a spoiler to say the end of the film has Henri Fortin dancing a waltz. I can't speak accurately for Mr Wallis, but I don't think most (any) of the rest of us think dancing a waltz is violent. I think Ms Huntress had unrealistic expectations for this film, It is NOT -- I repeat, NOT -- Victor Hugo's Les Miserables! Henri Fortin has been told by people on many occasions that his life is like that of Jean Valjean. He gets a copy of the book and asks people to read it to him so he can try to understand what those people were telling him. He is, indeed, like M. Valjean and this epic tale shows his generous nature in helping many people. Did he do some bad things? Yes, but his good works very much outweigh them. I recommend Ms. Huntress watch this film again, this time leaving all expectations behind. My warning to those who would watch this film: Have some tissues handy. This is a well done film, and very touching/heartwarming. The French, unlike American film makers, seem to be able to do this kind of film without sappiness and emotional manipulation. Did I mention the tissues?

    If you search IMDb for "Les Miserables," you'll get 19 films under the IMDb "Titles (Exact Matches)." The dates of these cover 101 years, from 1909 to 2010! But the original title of this remarkable 1995 version is "Les Mis&eacute;rables du vingti&egrave;me si&egrave;cle"(the miserable ones of the twentieth century.) The film title credits read "Les Miserables of Victor Hugo" but then adds "freely adapted" by Claude Lelouch." Lelouch was also the director and producer. I saw the film on television in the 4:3 format. I would have preferred letterbox so I could have enlarged it to fit in my wide screen plasma TV, but the film is in French and the subtitles in letterbox format would have been hard for people viewing it on older sets to read. (I found the subtitles to be very easy to read.) But I don't think much was lost by trimming the edges of the original film. The main characters in the film are Henri Fortin (Jean-Paul Belmondo), the father and his son by the same name, who earns the nickname of Jean Valjean (Victor Hugo's protagonist) because of events in his life that correspond to those of Hugo's Valjean. When the novel is read to Henri Fortin to help him understand why the nickname, the story telling dissolves into an enactment of the novel. In those sequences we see Fortin playing the part of Valjean. I had a little difficulty following the start of the movie, which opens with a wretchedly sad Henri Fortin as Jean Valjean regretting something he did and calling after "the little chimney sweep." (I am not familiar with that part of Hugo's novel. We learn later on what Valjean regretted.) It then switches to a major ball being held in France to celebrate New Year's Day at the onset of the 20th century. This leads up to Henri Fortin the father being falsely accused of murder. This section of the film deals with Henri senior's life as a convict, his wife's and young son's lives during that time, and his escape attempt. Things advance from there to his son, now grown and a prize fighter, at the end of World War I. The film then moves forward about 20 years and an older Henri junior is now a retired French champion driving a moving van as German rule begins to sweep Europe near the start of World War II (a couple of years before Pearl Harbor caused the US to enter that war.) I think that the more you know of the Victor Hugo book the more you will like this film, but I think that even without any knowledge of the original you will still get a lot out of watching it. From then on there is no dull moment as the protagonists move through lives of anguish and deceptions. Although the film is full of tragedy, it leaves you filling good at the end.

    Meet Henri Fortin, the product of a tough life. He's middle-aged with youthful glories in the boxing ring behind him. The Germans are occupying France and have installed the Quisling Vichy Regime. Fortin is uninterested in the political events unfolding around him. He's a moving man (d&eacute;m&eacute;nageur). Among his clients is a Jewish Family the Zinmans who have decided to relocate to Normandy to escape the attention of the Germans and their Vichy allies. As part of the deal the illiterate M. Fortin asks the Zinmans to read him Victor Hugo's Les Mis&eacute;rables to pass time. Seizing upon the parallels between his life and Victor Hugo's hero Valjean, Fortin rises to the occasion when the Zinmans discover that Normandy is no more amenable to them than Paris. The decision leads to a twisted course so close to the edge of criminality and of legitimacy that one must question the very concept of heroism. There is pathos when Mrs Zinman, not a Jew ends up shipped out because she will not prostitute herself to the Germans. There is bathos when the farmers who rescue Lawyer Zinman imprison him with spurious tales that Hitler conquered America. Fate bring a curious end to the farm couple. Salome Zinman ensconced in a nunnery is forced to recite The Lord's Prayer for a German officer who does not notice she confuses "Lead us not into temptation" (Et ne nous laissez pas succomber &agrave; la tentation.), with "Deliver us from evil." (Mais d&eacute;livrez-nous du mal.) Yet who will deliver Fortin when all his worlds collide?

    I had seen the Broadway version of this story and was very thrilled since I really had never heard of this story before going to see it on the stage. When I heard that this film was being played at a local Art Theatre, I eagerly gathered my family to go see it. I was horrified at first, because the entire movie was in French with English subtitles. No where was to be heard the incredible lush musicals I had seen in the play. You see, I knew nothing of the story, other than getting the chance to see it in a live performance. So I had "tricked" my family into going to see what we all thought was going to be a musical. Foreign films with subtitles are the worst kind of torture to my family and the few friends I dragged with us. However, as the story unfolded, I could see not one of my family (scattered around the theatre) got up to leave. At the conclusion, we were all extremely moved, and I realized the incredible nature of this story by Victor Hugo. I have since seen other versions of this timeless story, but I have to say, this one is the most moving and my favorite. It was so incredible to see the cross stories, of the WWII present and the Victor Hugo past. The present day characters could see themselves in the plot in the book. All the characters made me long for their safety and survival and I was moved beyond words to be part of their lives (both the present day characters and the past characters). Sometimes it was frustrating to get caught up in one story line and then switch to the other story line. But soon, you were caught up again in that change in time and place and you didn't want to switch to the other story line. Every one of my teenage children came up to me at the conclusion and thanked me for making them see something they would never have chosen for themselves.

    Based upon Victor Hugo's classic nineteenth century novel is this lavish epic about humanity's many levels of compassion, selfishness, brutality and love. In short, the good and evil of mankind. One can immediately appreciate writer/director Claude Lelouch's passion and sincere admiration for Hugo's story, as he lovingly relates to us the story of Henri Fontin, a man whose miserable beginnings yet big heart parallel those of the famed Jean Valjean. Lead actor Jean-Paul Belmondo is thoroughly enjoyable as the generous spirited Fontin, also playing on occasion the heroic Jean Valjean in flashback. Strong support comes from Michel Boujenah and Alessandra Martines as a fugitive Jewish couple who turn to Fontin for help. Lelouch's daughter Salome plays the couples' tragic child who is left in a Catholic orphanage to hide her true identity. Clementine Celarie is moving in her brief role as Fontin's mother, and playing "Javert" is a convincing Philippe Khorsand. All this intense acting and Lelouch's passionate direction ensure a most involving, highly rewarding film. Cinematography is often inspired (again Claude Lelouch), capturing rural France. Art direction from Jacques Bufnoir is solid, and music comes from Francis Lai, Erik Berchot, Didier Barbelivien, Michel Legrand and Phillipe Servain. Helene de Luze provides the editing. Monday, March 24, 1997 - Hoyts Croydon Claude Lelouch lovingly tells this war time variation on Victor Hugo's novel. Purists and fans of the musical may not get a great deal from this translation, but lovers of quality, epic cinema will. All credit must go to Lelouch for the way he nurtures this film, delivering excellence in all areas throughout the entire running time. Acting performances range from solid to riveting, and the entire technical crew astound also. The music came from several sources. By far the best French film I have ever seen.

    The received wisdom is that the rate at which film masterpieces are made has slowed to a virtual standstill. But this film, a relatively recent work (1995) by the great French director Claude Lelouch, contradicts that. It is a brilliant reworking of Hugo's classic tale, set against the turmoil of occupied France and manages to be both epic and intimate. It is one of the most moving and powerful films of the past 50 years and yet at the same time it manages to be charming, uplifting and even funny at times. Arguably, it is also a film that only a Frenchman could have made because it is so brutally honest about the conduct of so many 'ordinary' French people under the Vichy government. The performances are heartbreakingly good, Belmondo has never been better and he is surrounded by a remarkable cast. Not least of these is the young Salome Lelouch (Claude's daughter) - effortless in her role as the 11-y-old separated from her parents as Hitler's stormtroopers sweep across France. I commend this film to everyone, it occupies vaguely similar territory to that of Schindler's List but is incomparably better - more real, curiously more human, more engaging, less artful. Breathtaking.

    Jean Paul Belmondo plays a dual role that should have garnered him awards for his performance as both Valjean and as Henri Fortin who takes in a Jewish girl during World War II. Her parents have been taken by the German Nazis. The girl reads to Henri from Victor Hugo's classic novel, Les Miserables, since I believe Henri himself can't read. Well, he imagines himself in the role as Valjean. The film is dually impressive relating the past to the present day life of France during the French Revolution and World War II during the German occupation of France. The girl is safe in a French convent. Her parents including her French non-Jewish mother who married a French Jew succumbs to becoming prisoner. Her husband survives a shooting and is taken in by French farmers who have their own agenda. Regardless, the ending is not to be missed. It's both about the joy of living during the worst of times and how fortunate we are.

    I saw this movie several years ago and remember it being extremely well done and very moving. Brilliant characterizations and acting. Opening the movie is one of the most moving ballet solos I have ever seen. It was absolutely spell-binding. What a fabulous way for two leading characters to meet. Worth seeing the movie just for that. Recalls the brilliant dancing of Gregory Hines and Mikhail Baryshnikov in White Nights. Different of course but another fabulous movie dance moment (W.N. was not such a fabulous movie but still very watchable). And if you love dance and haven't seen H & B dancing together, well then...

    I watched this a few years ago as a prelude to the book. I had to watch it twice as it seemed confusing. The main reason for this is that I hadn't read the book and had no idea of the storyline of Les Miserables. The second time I watched the movie, I understood it very well. It is a complex but fantastic movie made in such a way that it is easy to understand. This version compares the life of Henri Forten with the life of Jean Valjean. This is done in a parallel as the movie plays. It is well done and one of my favorite movies of all time. Alessandra Martines is stunningly beautiful and Salom&eacute; Lelouch is fantastic also. Anyone who knows a little of the Les Miserables story should enjoy this movie. It is a great movie with a fantastic soundtrack, cast and acting. I'd give it 12 stars if I could.

    My audience stood and applauded this film too! Those who have herein praised this film have brought nostalgic tears to my sad but smiling face... Those who wasted space and complained about this film seemed beneath my ability to even pity (at the risk of losing the message of the work: compassion!!). The great essence of Hugo's master work is perfectly represented and by moving it forward in time it somehow enters directly into our lives... in ways the novel and all the other films based on it really could not. The closest thing to this film, in my opinion, was the Broadway play (musical), because of the brilliant music, staging, acting, etc. Even so, this film touched me more than the live theater presentation did. When I tell someone how good it is and they then see it (the video mind you) they always come back with eyes bugging out and express heart pounding gratitude! A MUST SEE... sits right along with King of Hearts (Le Roi de Couer - 1968), The Great Dictator, Brazil, Kafka, Julia, Dr. Strangelove, and JFK, on my list.

Her parents have been taken by the German Nazis. The girl reads to Henri from Victor Hugo's classic novel, Les Miserables, since I believe Henri himself can't read. Well, he imagines himself in the role as Valjean. The film is dually impressive relating the past to the present day life of France during the French Revolution and World War II during the German occupation of France. The girl is safe in a French convent. Her parents including her French non-Jewish mother who married a French Jew succumbs to becoming prisoner. Her husband survives a shooting and is taken in by French farmers who have their own agenda. Regardless, the ending is not to be missed. It's both about the joy of living during the worst of times and how fortunate we are.

    I saw this movie several years ago and remember it being extremely well done and very moving. Brilliant characterizations and acting. Opening the movie is one of the most moving ballet solos I have ever seen. It was absolutely spell-binding. What a fabulous way for two leading characters to meet. Worth seeing the movie just for that. Recalls the brilliant dancing of Gregory Hines and Mikhail Baryshnikov in White Nights. Different of course but another fabulous movie dance moment (W.N. was not such a fabulous movie but still very watchable). And if you love dance and haven't seen H & B dancing together, well then...

    I watched this a few years ago as a prelude to the book. I had to watch it twice as it seemed confusing. The main reason for this is that I hadn't read the book and had no idea of the storyline of Les Miserables. The second time I watched the movie, I understood it very well. It is a complex but fantastic movie made in such a way that it is easy to understand. This version compares the life of Henri Forten with the life of Jean Valjean. This is done in a parallel as the movie plays. It is well done and one of my favorite movies of all time. Alessandra Martines is stunningly beautiful and Salom&eacute; Lelouch is fantastic also. Anyone who knows a little of the Les Miserables story should enjoy this movie. It is a great movie with a fantastic soundtrack, cast and acting. I'd give it 12 stars if I could.

    My audience stood and applauded this film too! Those who have herein praised this film have brought nostalgic tears to my sad but smiling face... Those who wasted space and complained about this film seemed beneath my ability to even pity (at the risk of losing the message of the work: compassion!!). The great essence of Hugo's master work is perfectly represented and by moving it forward in time it somehow enters directly into our lives... in ways the novel and all the other films based on it really could not. The closest thing to this film, in my opinion, was the Broadway play (musical), because of the brilliant music, staging, acting, etc. Even so, this film touched me more than the live theater presentation did. When I tell someone how good it is and they then see it (the video mind you) they always come back with eyes bugging out and express heart pounding gratitude! A MUST SEE... sits right along with King of Hearts (Le Roi de Couer - 1968), The Great Dictator, Brazil, Kafka, Julia, Dr. Strangelove, and JFK, on my list.

    After reading most of the reviews, I felt there weren't any more superlatives I could add. But then I ran across two decidedly negative reviews and feel the need to make a few comments -- and also add a key item you might need when watching the film. Mr Wallis tells us the ending is violent. My question is, "What film were you watching"? I don't think this is too much of a spoiler to say the end of the film has Henri Fortin dancing a waltz. I can't speak accurately for Mr Wallis, but I don't think most (any) of the rest of us think dancing a waltz is violent. I think Ms Huntress had unrealistic expectations for this film, It is NOT -- I repeat, NOT -- Victor Hugo's Les Miserables! Henri Fortin has been told by people on many occasions that his life is like that of Jean Valjean. He gets a copy of the book and asks people to read it to him so he can try to understand what those people were telling him. He is, indeed, like M. Valjean and this epic tale shows his generous nature in helping many people. Did he do some bad things? Yes, but his good works very much outweigh them. I recommend Ms. Huntress watch this film again, this time leaving all expectations behind. My warning to those who would watch this film: Have some tissues handy. This is a well done film, and very touching/heartwarming. The French, unlike American film makers, seem to be able to do this kind of film without sappiness and emotional manipulation. Did I mention the tissues?

    If you search IMDb for "Les Miserables," you'll get 19 films under the IMDb "Titles (Exact Matches)." The dates of these cover 101 years, from 1909 to 2010! But the original title of this remarkable 1995 version is "Les Mis&eacute;rables du vingti&egrave;me si&egrave;cle"(the miserable ones of the twentieth century.) The film title credits read "Les Miserables of Victor Hugo" but then adds "freely adapted" by Claude Lelouch." Lelouch was also the director and producer. I saw the film on television in the 4:3 format. I would have preferred letterbox so I could have enlarged it to fit in my wide screen plasma TV, but the film is in French and the subtitles in letterbox format would have been hard for people viewing it on older sets to read. (I found the subtitles to be very easy to read.) But I don't think much was lost by trimming the edges of the original film. The main characters in the film are Henri Fortin (Jean-Paul Belmondo), the father and his son by the same name, who earns the nickname of Jean Valjean (Victor Hugo's protagonist) because of events in his life that correspond to those of Hugo's Valjean. When the novel is read to Henri Fortin to help him understand why the nickname, the story telling dissolves into an enactment of the novel. In those sequences we see Fortin playing the part of Valjean. I had a little difficulty following the start of the movie, which opens with a wretchedly sad Henri Fortin as Jean Valjean regretting something he did and calling after "the little chimney sweep." (I am not familiar with that part of Hugo's novel. We learn later on what Valjean regretted.) It then switches to a major ball being held in France to celebrate New Year's Day at the onset of the 20th century. This leads up to Henri Fortin the father being falsely accused of murder. This section of the film deals with Henri senior's life as a convict, his wife's and young son's lives during that time, and his escape attempt. Things advance from there to his son, now grown and a prize fighter, at the end of World War I. The film then moves forward about 20 years and an older Henri junior is now a retired French champion driving a moving van as German rule begins to sweep Europe near the start of World War II (a couple of years before Pearl Harbor caused the US to enter that war.) I think that the more you know of the Victor Hugo book the more you will like this film, but I think that even without any knowledge of the original you will still get a lot out of watching it. From then on there is no dull moment as the protagonists move through lives of anguish and deceptions. Although the film is full of tragedy, it leaves you filling good at the end.

    Meet Henri Fortin, the product of a tough life. He's middle-aged with youthful glories in the boxing ring behind him. The Germans are occupying France and have installed the Quisling Vichy Regime. Fortin is uninterested in the political events unfolding around him. He's a moving man (d&eacute;m&eacute;nageur). Among his clients is a Jewish Family the Zinmans who have decided to relocate to Normandy to escape the attention of the Germans and their Vichy allies. As part of the deal the illiterate M. Fortin asks the Zinmans to read him Victor Hugo's Les Mis&eacute;rables to pass time. Seizing upon the parallels between his life and Victor Hugo's hero Valjean, Fortin rises to the occasion when the Zinmans discover that Normandy is no more amenable to them than Paris. The decision leads to a twisted course so close to the edge of criminality and of legitimacy that one must question the very concept of heroism. There is pathos when Mrs Zinman, not a Jew ends up shipped out because she will not prostitute herself to the Germans. There is bathos when the farmers who rescue Lawyer Zinman imprison him with spurious tales that Hitler conquered America. Fate bring a curious end to the farm couple. Salome Zinman ensconced in a nunnery is forced to recite The Lord's Prayer for a German officer who does not notice she confuses "Lead us not into temptation" (Et ne nous laissez pas succomber &agrave; la tentation.), with "Deliver us from evil." (Mais d&eacute;livrez-nous du mal.) Yet who will deliver Fortin when all his worlds collide?

    I had seen the Broadway version of this story and was very thrilled since I really had never heard of this story before going to see it on the stage. When I heard that this film was being played at a local Art Theatre, I eagerly gathered my family to go see it. I was horrified at first, because the entire movie was in French with English subtitles. No where was to be heard the incredible lush musicals I had seen in the play. You see, I knew nothing of the story, other than getting the chance to see it in a live performance. So I had "tricked" my family into going to see what we all thought was going to be a musical. Foreign films with subtitles are the worst kind of torture to my family and the few friends I dragged with us. However, as the story unfolded, I could see not one of my family (scattered around the theatre) got up to leave. At the conclusion, we were all extremely moved, and I realized the incredible nature of this story by Victor Hugo. I have since seen other versions of this timeless story, but I have to say, this one is the most moving and my favorite. It was so incredible to see the cross stories, of the WWII present and the Victor Hugo past. The present day characters could see themselves in the plot in the book. All the characters made me long for their safety and survival and I was moved beyond words to be part of their lives (both the present day characters and the past characters). Sometimes it was frustrating to get caught up in one story line and then switch to the other story line. But soon, you were caught up again in that change in time and place and you didn't want to switch to the other story line. Every one of my teenage children came up to me at the conclusion and thanked me for making them see something they would never have chosen for themselves.

    Based upon Victor Hugo's classic nineteenth century novel is this lavish epic about humanity's many levels of compassion, selfishness, brutality and love. In short, the good and evil of mankind. One can immediately appreciate writer/director Claude Lelouch's passion and sincere admiration for Hugo's story, as he lovingly relates to us the story of Henri Fontin, a man whose miserable beginnings yet big heart parallel those of the famed Jean Valjean. Lead actor Jean-Paul Belmondo is thoroughly enjoyable as the generous spirited Fontin, also playing on occasion the heroic Jean Valjean in flashback. Strong support comes from Michel Boujenah and Alessandra Martines as a fugitive Jewish couple who turn to Fontin for help. Lelouch's daughter Salome plays the couples' tragic child who is left in a Catholic orphanage to hide her true identity. Clementine Celarie is moving in her brief role as Fontin's mother, and playing "Javert" is a convincing Philippe Khorsand. All this intense acting and Lelouch's passionate direction ensure a most involving, highly rewarding film. Cinematography is often inspired (again Claude Lelouch), capturing rural France. Art direction from Jacques Bufnoir is solid, and music comes from Francis Lai, Erik Berchot, Didier Barbelivien, Michel Legrand and Phillipe Servain. Helene de Luze provides the editing. Monday, March 24, 1997 - Hoyts Croydon Claude Lelouch lovingly tells this war time variation on Victor Hugo's novel. Purists and fans of the musical may not get a great deal from this translation, but lovers of quality, epic cinema will. All credit must go to Lelouch for the way he nurtures this film, delivering excellence in all areas throughout the entire running time. Acting performances range from solid to riveting, and the entire technical crew astound also. The music came from several sources. By far the best French film I have ever seen.

    The received wisdom is that the rate at which film masterpieces are made has slowed to a virtual standstill. But this film, a relatively recent work (1995) by the great French director Claude Lelouch, contradicts that. It is a brilliant reworking of Hugo's classic tale, set against the turmoil of occupied France and manages to be both epic and intimate. It is one of the most moving and powerful films of the past 50 years and yet at the same time it manages to be charming, uplifting and even funny at times. Arguably, it is also a film that only a Frenchman could have made because it is so brutally honest about the conduct of so many 'ordinary' French people under the Vichy government. The performances are heartbreakingly good, Belmondo has never been better and he is surrounded by a remarkable cast. Not least of these is the young Salome Lelouch (Claude's daughter) - effortless in her role as the 11-y-old separated from her parents as Hitler's stormtroopers sweep across France. I commend this film to everyone, it occupies vaguely similar territory to that of Schindler's List but is incomparably better - more real, curiously more human, more engaging, less artful. Breathtaking.

Acting performances range from solid to riveting, and the entire technical crew astound also. The music came from several sources. By far the best French film I have ever seen.

    The received wisdom is that the rate at which film masterpieces are made has slowed to a virtual standstill. But this film, a relatively recent work (1995) by the great French director Claude Lelouch, contradicts that. It is a brilliant reworking of Hugo's classic tale, set against the turmoil of occupied France and manages to be both epic and intimate. It is one of the most moving and powerful films of the past 50 years and yet at the same time it manages to be charming, uplifting and even funny at times. Arguably, it is also a film that only a Frenchman could have made because it is so brutally honest about the conduct of so many 'ordinary' French people under the Vichy government. The performances are heartbreakingly good, Belmondo has never been better and he is surrounded by a remarkable cast. Not least of these is the young Salome Lelouch (Claude's daughter) - effortless in her role as the 11-y-old separated from her parents as Hitler's stormtroopers sweep across France. I commend this film to everyone, it occupies vaguely similar territory to that of Schindler's List but is incomparably better - more real, curiously more human, more engaging, less artful. Breathtaking.

    Jean Paul Belmondo plays a dual role that should have garnered him awards for his performance as both Valjean and as Henri Fortin who takes in a Jewish girl during World War II. Her parents have been taken by the German Nazis. The girl reads to Henri from Victor Hugo's classic novel, Les Miserables, since I believe Henri himself can't read. Well, he imagines himself in the role as Valjean. The film is dually impressive relating the past to the present day life of France during the French Revolution and World War II during the German occupation of France. The girl is safe in a French convent. Her parents including her French non-Jewish mother who married a French Jew succumbs to becoming prisoner. Her husband survives a shooting and is taken in by French farmers who have their own agenda. Regardless, the ending is not to be missed. It's both about the joy of living during the worst of times and how fortunate we are.

    I saw this movie several years ago and remember it being extremely well done and very moving. Brilliant characterizations and acting. Opening the movie is one of the most moving ballet solos I have ever seen. It was absolutely spell-binding. What a fabulous way for two leading characters to meet. Worth seeing the movie just for that. Recalls the brilliant dancing of Gregory Hines and Mikhail Baryshnikov in White Nights. Different of course but another fabulous movie dance moment (W.N. was not such a fabulous movie but still very watchable). And if you love dance and haven't seen H & B dancing together, well then...

    I watched this a few years ago as a prelude to the book. I had to watch it twice as it seemed confusing. The main reason for this is that I hadn't read the book and had no idea of the storyline of Les Miserables. The second time I watched the movie, I understood it very well. It is a complex but fantastic movie made in such a way that it is easy to understand. This version compares the life of Henri Forten with the life of Jean Valjean. This is done in a parallel as the movie plays. It is well done and one of my favorite movies of all time. Alessandra Martines is stunningly beautiful and Salom&eacute; Lelouch is fantastic also. Anyone who knows a little of the Les Miserables story should enjoy this movie. It is a great movie with a fantastic soundtrack, cast and acting. I'd give it 12 stars if I could.

    My audience stood and applauded this film too! Those who have herein praised this film have brought nostalgic tears to my sad but smiling face... Those who wasted space and complained about this film seemed beneath my ability to even pity (at the risk of losing the message of the work: compassion!!). The great essence of Hugo's master work is perfectly represented and by moving it forward in time it somehow enters directly into our lives... in ways the novel and all the other films based on it really could not. The closest thing to this film, in my opinion, was the Broadway play (musical), because of the brilliant music, staging, acting, etc. Even so, this film touched me more than the live theater presentation did. When I tell someone how good it is and they then see it (the video mind you) they always come back with eyes bugging out and express heart pounding gratitude! A MUST SEE... sits right along with King of Hearts (Le Roi de Couer - 1968), The Great Dictator, Brazil, Kafka, Julia, Dr. Strangelove, and JFK, on my list.
