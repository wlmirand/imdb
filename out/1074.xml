 <sinopse>
  Generation X Graduates face life after college with a filmmaker looking for work and love in Houston.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In this study of Generation X manners, Lelaina, the valedictorian of her college class, camcords her friends in a mock documentary of posteducation life. Troy is her best friend, a perpetually unemployed musical slacker. Vickie is a manager at the Gap who worries about the results of an AIDS test, while Sammy has problems grappling with his sexuality. When Lelaina meets Michael, an earnest video executive who takes her homemade video to his MTV-like station, she must decide what she values--the materialism of yuppie Michael or the philosophical musings of Troy.

    It's like a vortex, the Reality Bites pitch video Ben Stiller's character shows Winona's is actually THIS MOVIE! The writer must've made a checklist of all of the 90's "edgy topics" like AIDS, homosexuality, and then threw in some 80's "parents just don't understand", making for a very after school special like tsunami of cheese. It looks promising from the cover but it's really a Hollywood movie trying to act like an indie flick, a product of grunge being highly marketable that year. It didn't do it for me when I saw its debut at 16, and after giving it another try just now it's even worse than what I remember. I really hope future generations don't refer to this film to see what life was like back then. It doesn't come close to having the same depth John Hughes movies had the previous decade. I guess this is Ben Stiller's directorial debut and I'm so glad he went on to do comedy instead. You can see some of his self deprecating humor when he freaks out at Ethan Hawke's character near the end. I don't know if there is a really definitive Generation X 90's movie, I'd vote Chasing Amy if I had to pick one though.

    Watching cable today, I caught the last 30 mins of Reality Bites starring Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke and Janene Garolfo. Is it me?? Does the entire scene were Michael returns to offer Lelaina some work & Troy makes it OBVIOUS he & Lel is INVOLVED remind U of Prince's film PURPLE RAIN ??? Especially when Troy jumps on stage & begin to expose their sexual exploits causing Lelaina to FLEE from the venue! Remember Prince singing "Darling Nikki" & Appolonia running out of the club?!! This whole scene was literally SNATCHED from Purple Rain. Stiller & Childress ... DO U HAVE NO SHAME ? In their defense, this film certainly lives up to its title! Incidentally . . . the outside camera shot of the venue looks a lot like the music club from Purple Rain too. SMH.

    I love this film; Ethan Hawke is brilliant and really does sum up the 'searcher' generation, the new Beat. Grunge in this film is typified by over-intelligent, under-achieving, dope induced philosophical musings and desire to make a difference but not knowing how to go about it in world where young people feel anonymous and disenfranchised and dealing with modern day issues; coming out, HIV tests, unemployment, friendship, love and life aspirations. I think this is perfectly cast, loads of familiar faces, and I think this is my favourite role of Winona Ryder. Steve Zahn and Janeane Garofalo were great and Ben Stiller (who also directed) is very good in this, again one of his best roles but Ethan Hawke is the deserved lead in this snapshot of reality. Everyone is good in this, and there are truisms left right and centre - it speaks to the heart & soul and is relevant to my generation and I'm sure has relevance to later decades and has - IMHO - aged well. It is super-funny, touching and enlightening; something for everyone who's young and old enough. Even after 20 years it's one of my favourite films.

    "None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free." - Goethe "Work Makes Freedom" - sign above Auschwitz entrance The directorial debut of Ben Stiller, "Reality Bites" is a well meaning but slight film which hopes to capture the tempo and anxieties of Generation X. The film revolves around a small cast of young adults (Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, Ben Stiller, Steve Zahn), all of whom are raging caricatures. There's the artist, the sex junkie, the drop out, the corporate sell out and of course the always-precious Winona Ryder, who serves as our window into their world. She faces well worn conflicts: does she pursue a career in the arts, or trade her dreams and aspirations for a "reliable" corporate job? Does she settle down with a "loser" musician, or a likable but stiff businessman in a suit? At the heart of the film is therefore a tug-of-war between the logic and rationales of techno capitalism and the sensitive soul's vague yearnings for something else. Whilst the film is absent of analysis or serious insight, it does capture a certain relevant vacuity. Stiller's whiny young adults hang in limbo, aimless, lethargic, high-strung and always placating themselves with material or biochemical pleasures. Deeming the adult world abhorrent, they flutter in the wind, unable to function in it, but unable to conceive of, latch onto or find something else. Other anxieties abound: fears of rejection, poverty, success and judgement turn all these characters into emotion wrecks. They're stuck in post graduate delirium and quarter life crises, some pushed into self promotion, solipsism and competition, others opting to instead drop out of the game altogether. Like all these films, "Reality Bites" turns its back on a deeper reality. It ignores the fact that its anxieties are essentially social symptoms spawned by social systems. Indeed, our very neurological structure is closely tied to, and is necessarily continuous with, environmental relations, which are themselves directly responsible for certain neurological or synaptic connections flourishing or atrophying and dying off. In a very real sense, you are continually being built by the "outside". By individualising what is systemic, these films thus override the possibility of their subjects becoming agents, rather than patients, of their symptoms. Whilst there are hundreds of films like "Reality Bites" about Generation's Xers, Generation Y's anxieties don't seem to make it to cinema screens. Maybe they've been completely inculcated, have self medicated themselves into zombiedom, or simply have no use for cinema, the stuffy medium of their forefathers. Perhaps with interactive media supplanting old media, the quaint idea of stories, and even the audience/object dichotomy itself, is displaced by a situation in which the anxiety tale is writ on the subject itself; their virtual and real bodies are the new anxiety performance. Cynicism and irony were a huge part of Generation X's identity. They saw the ideals, dreams and possibilities of the Baby Boomers get thoroughly squashed. The result was a generation which recognised the "reality" that rebellion and honest dissent would either fail or make one a laughing stock. Authentic emotional expression was to be buried or cocooned in irony/cynicism, lest one risk ridicule or hurt. But Generation X at least knew how to smell BS. Generation Y's thoroughly of the post-everything, multicultural, accept-everything entertainment world. They're both stronger and more fragile, supremely confident and well adjusted, but perhaps with a nihilism buried so deep they're not even aware of it, shuffling off to the abattoir with smiling faces, heads bobbing to personalised play-lists. No surprise that The Journal of Social Psychology reports that Millennials think about social problems less, have less interest in government, family and community, and have a very inflated sense of self which in turn leads to unrealistic expectations and chronic disappointment. They're also pushing back each of the five milestones of adulthood: completing school, leaving home, becoming financially independent, marrying and having kids. But maybe this is all overly pessimistic. Maybe it's stereotyping. Maybe every generation's a mass of differences, simultaneously ahead of its time, of its time, and of the past. Or maybe it's prophetic that our next generation will be dubbed Generation Z; a nation of snoozers. 7.5/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Broad and shallow film directed by Ben Stiller spins an unoriginal and unsurprising tale with characters and situations seen a dozen times before. The only things that have changed are the clothes, the soundtrack, the slang and the cultural references which begin to feel like the film's only purpose for being. This film covers ground so familiar that it's flat and barren. The central characters feel like stand-ins for real people, the romance doesn't spark, and the one-dimensional feel of it all makes this more about Generation ZZZZZZ than X. Not one of the actors has an original or memorable moment or anything of interest to say.

    Look, I get that being a young adult ain't easy, they're a lot of issues in life no matter what age...except for the characters in this movie. Winona Ryder's character (lelaina) is a horrible person who steals 900 dollars from her father...because she's "Rebellious" and Ethan Hawke's character (Troy) is one of the most despicable people ever put to film. Apathetic, pretentious, egotistical, despicable, he's just an awful character. AND YET, these two are our leads who we root for! THESE TWO! Lelaina is a stealing, whiny, pathetic child while Ethan is a lazy, jerk who thinks his music will be his career (ignoring the fact his music makes Creed sound like The Band)hey Ethan, most people who have a music passion tend to have a job so they can support themselves while chasing their dreams...just a thought...oh wait you have parents willing to support you and give you money but they're just "The Man" to you. ugh.... This movie is framed like were supposed to root for these two when characters like this should be framed as if they were the horrible people they are and consequences happen to them (a la Trainspotting) instead they are just two cool rebels...The only three likable characters either get barely any screen time (Janeane Garofolo's character and Steve Zahn who deserved much better) Apparently to this movie, being privileged sucks too...was this movie made by those whiny teenagers in class who make those poems that mean absolutely nothing? But my biggest question is...what is the point of this movie? Was this was meant to be a satire of the 90s? Well it came out too early in 1994 for this to satirize it...but even if it wasn't it was not framed like a satire. It was filmed as a serious movie... Was it to relate to teenagers or young adults? Maybe so but I'd hate to meet the people who are like this, because in real life there are consequences and for stuff like the characters in this movie, it's not a good consequence. Was it too be a nice romantic comedy? Well it fails there amazingly since the characters are so horrible. NO I'll tell you what it's purpose was, CASH! This movie is perfect pandering towards this kind of demographic, let's face it, teenagers are idiots and they will dig this kind of stuff, how ironic that a movie against the man was made by the man (BTW, that's irony Ethan Hawke. Not the actual meaning is the complete opposite of the literal meaning) Now there are people who apparently relate to this movie and say "That's what I was like" IF that's the case 1. NO WAY did you get out of something similar to that without ANY consequences like in this cinematic abomination. 2. Is that really a good thing? Most of the time when you look back on stuff like this you say "Wow...I was a complete idiot." Bottom line...I hate this movie...I hate everything about...The only good acting comes from Jeane, Steve and Ben Stiller (who I forgot to mention gets ridiculed for GASP having a steady, desirable job and being nice!) everyone else is awful, it's shot poorly. If this movie summed up Gen X than thank god we moved on from those days, things were better in those days? If it's like this movie than that is completely wrong!

    This is a film that does not deserve even one star, and although I listed it as such, it really gets zero from me. Simply put, it is the worst film of the 90s. The acting, particularly Hawke and Garafalo, stands out as being lame (Not that I cared about even one character in this film (Which even makes it worse than "Hot Tub Time Machine", who had at least one redeemable character)), and sad to say, the actors operated with a script that no one could possibly salvage. However, what is the worst is how the word "Comedy" pops up in the description of this film. There is not one scene in this film that can be classified as giggle worthy (Let alone funny). It certainly is one of the worst films I have ever saw in my life. The film is brutal, and should be avoided at all costs.

    http:// storiestoriesdk.wordpress.com/2011/08/20/ reality-will-bite-eventually/ Hi everyone , since this movie marked my teenage years in a way and today I got a little nostalgic a text for that in my blog feel free to read it and tell my what you think. It is not really a review it is more how some films affect us even if they aren't the greatest piece of film history, however generation X and this was surely a glamorized version of it feels like the hippies of the 60's compared to what we are experiencing now. And although the cynic in me says that this film is a bunch of clich&eacute;s at times and characters that are more stereotypical filled with songs that are there to manipulate your emotions I have a soft spot for it since it made me feel something that people would usually experience with theirs favorite band and so on

    this movie made me want to have grown up in the 90s! actually, i was 2yrs old when it came out so i didn't watch it until a few days ago. so obviously i don't know it its depiction of that generation is too accurate. But the thing is that even if on the surface it seems different today, the core of their angst remains the same. as a university student and an "adult" i'm supposed to have everything figured out and be in complete touch with who i really am inside. but the truth is that i'm so far from it, it's a miracle i can make any decisions about my future. i know what i want but i don't exactly who i am. weird, right?! so i really don't think its outdated or too old to relate to. also, i read some of the other reviews that criticized the characters; like how much Ryder's character nags, or how cynical or simply lazy hawk's character is, or how slutty and stereotypical Vicky is. i simply disagree; everyone is annoying and has depression periods in their lives when cant find a job after college, when they had all these hopes and dreams when graduating. troy is not lazy and is not too philosophical, he is simply a smart individual who refuses to get submerged by all those corporate society elements around him. and Vicky is just a normal young woman that works hard (becoming manager of the gap) and plays hard (sexual life and AIDS scare). so instead of looking at it in a really superficial manner, the deeper point of view is fascinating. and the implied meanings (fear, dreams, love, existence,...) with many more reasons, are what makes this one of my favorite movies.

    When I have seen career over views being written about Ben Stiller in various magazines and TV programs,they all mention how he first started out in indie films,before he got discovered by a more "mainstream" audience.After having a look at the back cover,and seeing the very impressive cast listings,I was looking forward to an amazing laugh- riot.Instead,I found the film to be shockingly light on laughs of any kind. The plot: A group of Generation X students graduate from college,and realise the it is time that they all enter the real world,and look for a real job.One of them (Celaina Pierce)has been making a documentary film about her friends,whilst she has been stuck at being an assistant to a TV chat-show host,that cant stand her.Suddenly,a sign of hope appears,when a very trendy music TV producer (Michael Grates) crashes into her car!.Due to how genuinely apologetic Michael seems to be (and also due to him being a producer)Ceclaina shows him the documentary that she has been making.Whilst this should be the first step to a clear path to stardom for Celaina,she sadly,has to decide if she wants to enter the "sell-out mainstream" world,or if she should stick to her Gen X friends.Which include her friend Troy,who is trying to figure out what his true feelings are for her... View on the film: For a film that has such a craving to be seen as part of the early to mid nineties alternative scene,it just feels completely artificial and hollow.One of the things that surprised me was,that apart from a handful of some very good tracks,the film completely skips over making any references to the excellent films,music and novels of the era.Whilst all of the strong cast give acceptable performances,they are sadly let down by the terrible screenplay by Helen Childres.Which includes very badly-written sub-story lines for Celainas friends (a storyline involving Janeane "Larry Sanders" Garofalo,waiting for results on being diagnosed with AIDS,is written as such a minor thing,that it should have been cut out at the earliest stages of the screenplay.)The main romance in the film between Celaina and Troy completely crumbles,due to there hardly being any chemistry between them,and also because Troy is a very nasty egotistical bully threw out the whole film. Final view on the film: A strong cast,let down by a very badly written,completely unfunny screenplay.

Apathetic, pretentious, egotistical, despicable, he's just an awful character. AND YET, these two are our leads who we root for! THESE TWO! Lelaina is a stealing, whiny, pathetic child while Ethan is a lazy, jerk who thinks his music will be his career (ignoring the fact his music makes Creed sound like The Band)hey Ethan, most people who have a music passion tend to have a job so they can support themselves while chasing their dreams...just a thought...oh wait you have parents willing to support you and give you money but they're just "The Man" to you. ugh.... This movie is framed like were supposed to root for these two when characters like this should be framed as if they were the horrible people they are and consequences happen to them (a la Trainspotting) instead they are just two cool rebels...The only three likable characters either get barely any screen time (Janeane Garofolo's character and Steve Zahn who deserved much better) Apparently to this movie, being privileged sucks too...was this movie made by those whiny teenagers in class who make those poems that mean absolutely nothing? But my biggest question is...what is the point of this movie? Was this was meant to be a satire of the 90s? Well it came out too early in 1994 for this to satirize it...but even if it wasn't it was not framed like a satire. It was filmed as a serious movie... Was it to relate to teenagers or young adults? Maybe so but I'd hate to meet the people who are like this, because in real life there are consequences and for stuff like the characters in this movie, it's not a good consequence. Was it too be a nice romantic comedy? Well it fails there amazingly since the characters are so horrible. NO I'll tell you what it's purpose was, CASH! This movie is perfect pandering towards this kind of demographic, let's face it, teenagers are idiots and they will dig this kind of stuff, how ironic that a movie against the man was made by the man (BTW, that's irony Ethan Hawke. Not the actual meaning is the complete opposite of the literal meaning) Now there are people who apparently relate to this movie and say "That's what I was like" IF that's the case 1. NO WAY did you get out of something similar to that without ANY consequences like in this cinematic abomination. 2. Is that really a good thing? Most of the time when you look back on stuff like this you say "Wow...I was a complete idiot." Bottom line...I hate this movie...I hate everything about...The only good acting comes from Jeane, Steve and Ben Stiller (who I forgot to mention gets ridiculed for GASP having a steady, desirable job and being nice!) everyone else is awful, it's shot poorly. If this movie summed up Gen X than thank god we moved on from those days, things were better in those days? If it's like this movie than that is completely wrong!

    This is a film that does not deserve even one star, and although I listed it as such, it really gets zero from me. Simply put, it is the worst film of the 90s. The acting, particularly Hawke and Garafalo, stands out as being lame (Not that I cared about even one character in this film (Which even makes it worse than "Hot Tub Time Machine", who had at least one redeemable character)), and sad to say, the actors operated with a script that no one could possibly salvage. However, what is the worst is how the word "Comedy" pops up in the description of this film. There is not one scene in this film that can be classified as giggle worthy (Let alone funny). It certainly is one of the worst films I have ever saw in my life. The film is brutal, and should be avoided at all costs.

It is not really a review it is more how some films affect us even if they aren't the greatest piece of film history, however generation X and this was surely a glamorized version of it feels like the hippies of the 60's compared to what we are experiencing now. And although the cynic in me says that this film is a bunch of clich&eacute;s at times and characters that are more stereotypical filled with songs that are there to manipulate your emotions I have a soft spot for it since it made me feel something that people would usually experience with theirs favorite band and so on

    this movie made me want to have grown up in the 90s! actually, i was 2yrs old when it came out so i didn't watch it until a few days ago. so obviously i don't know it its depiction of that generation is too accurate. But the thing is that even if on the surface it seems different today, the core of their angst remains the same. as a university student and an "adult" i'm supposed to have everything figured out and be in complete touch with who i really am inside. but the truth is that i'm so far from it, it's a miracle i can make any decisions about my future. i know what i want but i don't exactly who i am. weird, right?! so i really don't think its outdated or too old to relate to. also, i read some of the other reviews that criticized the characters; like how much Ryder's character nags, or how cynical or simply lazy hawk's character is, or how slutty and stereotypical Vicky is. i simply disagree; everyone is annoying and has depression periods in their lives when cant find a job after college, when they had all these hopes and dreams when graduating. troy is not lazy and is not too philosophical, he is simply a smart individual who refuses to get submerged by all those corporate society elements around him. and Vicky is just a normal young woman that works hard (becoming manager of the gap) and plays hard (sexual life and AIDS scare). so instead of looking at it in a really superficial manner, the deeper point of view is fascinating. and the implied meanings (fear, dreams, love, existence,...) with many more reasons, are what makes this one of my favorite movies.

    When I have seen career over views being written about Ben Stiller in various magazines and TV programs,they all mention how he first started out in indie films,before he got discovered by a more "mainstream" audience.After having a look at the back cover,and seeing the very impressive cast listings,I was looking forward to an amazing laugh- riot.Instead,I found the film to be shockingly light on laughs of any kind. The plot: A group of Generation X students graduate from college,and realise the it is time that they all enter the real world,and look for a real job.One of them (Celaina Pierce)has been making a documentary film about her friends,whilst she has been stuck at being an assistant to a TV chat-show host,that cant stand her.Suddenly,a sign of hope appears,when a very trendy music TV producer (Michael Grates) crashes into her car!.Due to how genuinely apologetic Michael seems to be (and also due to him being a producer)Ceclaina shows him the documentary that she has been making.Whilst this should be the first step to a clear path to stardom for Celaina,she sadly,has to decide if she wants to enter the "sell-out mainstream" world,or if she should stick to her Gen X friends.Which include her friend Troy,who is trying to figure out what his true feelings are for her... View on the film: For a film that has such a craving to be seen as part of the early to mid nineties alternative scene,it just feels completely artificial and hollow.One of the things that surprised me was,that apart from a handful of some very good tracks,the film completely skips over making any references to the excellent films,music and novels of the era.Whilst all of the strong cast give acceptable performances,they are sadly let down by the terrible screenplay by Helen Childres.Which includes very badly-written sub-story lines for Celainas friends (a storyline involving Janeane "Larry Sanders" Garofalo,waiting for results on being diagnosed with AIDS,is written as such a minor thing,that it should have been cut out at the earliest stages of the screenplay.)The main romance in the film between Celaina and Troy completely crumbles,due to there hardly being any chemistry between them,and also because Troy is a very nasty egotistical bully threw out the whole film. Final view on the film: A strong cast,let down by a very badly written,completely unfunny screenplay.

    It's like a vortex, the Reality Bites pitch video Ben Stiller's character shows Winona's is actually THIS MOVIE! The writer must've made a checklist of all of the 90's "edgy topics" like AIDS, homosexuality, and then threw in some 80's "parents just don't understand", making for a very after school special like tsunami of cheese. It looks promising from the cover but it's really a Hollywood movie trying to act like an indie flick, a product of grunge being highly marketable that year. It didn't do it for me when I saw its debut at 16, and after giving it another try just now it's even worse than what I remember. I really hope future generations don't refer to this film to see what life was like back then. It doesn't come close to having the same depth John Hughes movies had the previous decade. I guess this is Ben Stiller's directorial debut and I'm so glad he went on to do comedy instead. You can see some of his self deprecating humor when he freaks out at Ethan Hawke's character near the end. I don't know if there is a really definitive Generation X 90's movie, I'd vote Chasing Amy if I had to pick one though.

    Watching cable today, I caught the last 30 mins of Reality Bites starring Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke and Janene Garolfo. Is it me?? Does the entire scene were Michael returns to offer Lelaina some work & Troy makes it OBVIOUS he & Lel is INVOLVED remind U of Prince's film PURPLE RAIN ??? Especially when Troy jumps on stage & begin to expose their sexual exploits causing Lelaina to FLEE from the venue! Remember Prince singing "Darling Nikki" & Appolonia running out of the club?!! This whole scene was literally SNATCHED from Purple Rain. Stiller & Childress ... DO U HAVE NO SHAME ? In their defense, this film certainly lives up to its title! Incidentally . . . the outside camera shot of the venue looks a lot like the music club from Purple Rain too. SMH.

    I love this film; Ethan Hawke is brilliant and really does sum up the 'searcher' generation, the new Beat. Grunge in this film is typified by over-intelligent, under-achieving, dope induced philosophical musings and desire to make a difference but not knowing how to go about it in world where young people feel anonymous and disenfranchised and dealing with modern day issues; coming out, HIV tests, unemployment, friendship, love and life aspirations. I think this is perfectly cast, loads of familiar faces, and I think this is my favourite role of Winona Ryder. Steve Zahn and Janeane Garofalo were great and Ben Stiller (who also directed) is very good in this, again one of his best roles but Ethan Hawke is the deserved lead in this snapshot of reality. Everyone is good in this, and there are truisms left right and centre - it speaks to the heart & soul and is relevant to my generation and I'm sure has relevance to later decades and has - IMHO - aged well. It is super-funny, touching and enlightening; something for everyone who's young and old enough. Even after 20 years it's one of my favourite films.

    "None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free." - Goethe "Work Makes Freedom" - sign above Auschwitz entrance The directorial debut of Ben Stiller, "Reality Bites" is a well meaning but slight film which hopes to capture the tempo and anxieties of Generation X. The film revolves around a small cast of young adults (Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, Ben Stiller, Steve Zahn), all of whom are raging caricatures. There's the artist, the sex junkie, the drop out, the corporate sell out and of course the always-precious Winona Ryder, who serves as our window into their world. She faces well worn conflicts: does she pursue a career in the arts, or trade her dreams and aspirations for a "reliable" corporate job? Does she settle down with a "loser" musician, or a likable but stiff businessman in a suit? At the heart of the film is therefore a tug-of-war between the logic and rationales of techno capitalism and the sensitive soul's vague yearnings for something else. Whilst the film is absent of analysis or serious insight, it does capture a certain relevant vacuity. Stiller's whiny young adults hang in limbo, aimless, lethargic, high-strung and always placating themselves with material or biochemical pleasures. Deeming the adult world abhorrent, they flutter in the wind, unable to function in it, but unable to conceive of, latch onto or find something else. Other anxieties abound: fears of rejection, poverty, success and judgement turn all these characters into emotion wrecks. They're stuck in post graduate delirium and quarter life crises, some pushed into self promotion, solipsism and competition, others opting to instead drop out of the game altogether. Like all these films, "Reality Bites" turns its back on a deeper reality. It ignores the fact that its anxieties are essentially social symptoms spawned by social systems. Indeed, our very neurological structure is closely tied to, and is necessarily continuous with, environmental relations, which are themselves directly responsible for certain neurological or synaptic connections flourishing or atrophying and dying off. In a very real sense, you are continually being built by the "outside". By individualising what is systemic, these films thus override the possibility of their subjects becoming agents, rather than patients, of their symptoms. Whilst there are hundreds of films like "Reality Bites" about Generation's Xers, Generation Y's anxieties don't seem to make it to cinema screens. Maybe they've been completely inculcated, have self medicated themselves into zombiedom, or simply have no use for cinema, the stuffy medium of their forefathers. Perhaps with interactive media supplanting old media, the quaint idea of stories, and even the audience/object dichotomy itself, is displaced by a situation in which the anxiety tale is writ on the subject itself; their virtual and real bodies are the new anxiety performance. Cynicism and irony were a huge part of Generation X's identity. They saw the ideals, dreams and possibilities of the Baby Boomers get thoroughly squashed. The result was a generation which recognised the "reality" that rebellion and honest dissent would either fail or make one a laughing stock. Authentic emotional expression was to be buried or cocooned in irony/cynicism, lest one risk ridicule or hurt. But Generation X at least knew how to smell BS. Generation Y's thoroughly of the post-everything, multicultural, accept-everything entertainment world. They're both stronger and more fragile, supremely confident and well adjusted, but perhaps with a nihilism buried so deep they're not even aware of it, shuffling off to the abattoir with smiling faces, heads bobbing to personalised play-lists. No surprise that The Journal of Social Psychology reports that Millennials think about social problems less, have less interest in government, family and community, and have a very inflated sense of self which in turn leads to unrealistic expectations and chronic disappointment. They're also pushing back each of the five milestones of adulthood: completing school, leaving home, becoming financially independent, marrying and having kids. But maybe this is all overly pessimistic. Maybe it's stereotyping. Maybe every generation's a mass of differences, simultaneously ahead of its time, of its time, and of the past. Or maybe it's prophetic that our next generation will be dubbed Generation Z; a nation of snoozers. 7.5/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Broad and shallow film directed by Ben Stiller spins an unoriginal and unsurprising tale with characters and situations seen a dozen times before. The only things that have changed are the clothes, the soundtrack, the slang and the cultural references which begin to feel like the film's only purpose for being. This film covers ground so familiar that it's flat and barren. The central characters feel like stand-ins for real people, the romance doesn't spark, and the one-dimensional feel of it all makes this more about Generation ZZZZZZ than X. Not one of the actors has an original or memorable moment or anything of interest to say.

    I love this film; Ethan Hawke is brilliant and really does sum up the 'searcher' generation, the new Beat. Grunge in this film is typified by over-intelligent, under-achieving, dope induced philosophical musings and desire to make a difference but not knowing how to go about it in world where young people feel anonymous and disenfranchised and dealing with modern day issues; coming out, HIV tests, unemployment, friendship, love and life aspirations. I think this is perfectly cast, loads of familiar faces, and I think this is my favourite role of Winona Ryder. Steve Zahn and Janeane Garofalo were great and Ben Stiller (who also directed) is very good in this, again one of his best roles but Ethan Hawke is the deserved lead in this snapshot of reality. Everyone is good in this, and there are truisms left right and centre - it speaks to the heart & soul and is relevant to my generation and I'm sure has relevance to later decades and has - IMHO - aged well. It is super-funny, touching and enlightening; something for everyone who's young and old enough. Even after 20 years it's one of my favourite films.

    "None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free." - Goethe "Work Makes Freedom" - sign above Auschwitz entrance The directorial debut of Ben Stiller, "Reality Bites" is a well meaning but slight film which hopes to capture the tempo and anxieties of Generation X. The film revolves around a small cast of young adults (Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, Ben Stiller, Steve Zahn), all of whom are raging caricatures. There's the artist, the sex junkie, the drop out, the corporate sell out and of course the always-precious Winona Ryder, who serves as our window into their world. She faces well worn conflicts: does she pursue a career in the arts, or trade her dreams and aspirations for a "reliable" corporate job? Does she settle down with a "loser" musician, or a likable but stiff businessman in a suit? At the heart of the film is therefore a tug-of-war between the logic and rationales of techno capitalism and the sensitive soul's vague yearnings for something else. Whilst the film is absent of analysis or serious insight, it does capture a certain relevant vacuity. Stiller's whiny young adults hang in limbo, aimless, lethargic, high-strung and always placating themselves with material or biochemical pleasures. Deeming the adult world abhorrent, they flutter in the wind, unable to function in it, but unable to conceive of, latch onto or find something else. Other anxieties abound: fears of rejection, poverty, success and judgement turn all these characters into emotion wrecks. They're stuck in post graduate delirium and quarter life crises, some pushed into self promotion, solipsism and competition, others opting to instead drop out of the game altogether. Like all these films, "Reality Bites" turns its back on a deeper reality. It ignores the fact that its anxieties are essentially social symptoms spawned by social systems. Indeed, our very neurological structure is closely tied to, and is necessarily continuous with, environmental relations, which are themselves directly responsible for certain neurological or synaptic connections flourishing or atrophying and dying off. In a very real sense, you are continually being built by the "outside". By individualising what is systemic, these films thus override the possibility of their subjects becoming agents, rather than patients, of their symptoms. Whilst there are hundreds of films like "Reality Bites" about Generation's Xers, Generation Y's anxieties don't seem to make it to cinema screens. Maybe they've been completely inculcated, have self medicated themselves into zombiedom, or simply have no use for cinema, the stuffy medium of their forefathers. Perhaps with interactive media supplanting old media, the quaint idea of stories, and even the audience/object dichotomy itself, is displaced by a situation in which the anxiety tale is writ on the subject itself; their virtual and real bodies are the new anxiety performance. Cynicism and irony were a huge part of Generation X's identity. They saw the ideals, dreams and possibilities of the Baby Boomers get thoroughly squashed. The result was a generation which recognised the "reality" that rebellion and honest dissent would either fail or make one a laughing stock. Authentic emotional expression was to be buried or cocooned in irony/cynicism, lest one risk ridicule or hurt. But Generation X at least knew how to smell BS. Generation Y's thoroughly of the post-everything, multicultural, accept-everything entertainment world. They're both stronger and more fragile, supremely confident and well adjusted, but perhaps with a nihilism buried so deep they're not even aware of it, shuffling off to the abattoir with smiling faces, heads bobbing to personalised play-lists. No surprise that The Journal of Social Psychology reports that Millennials think about social problems less, have less interest in government, family and community, and have a very inflated sense of self which in turn leads to unrealistic expectations and chronic disappointment. They're also pushing back each of the five milestones of adulthood: completing school, leaving home, becoming financially independent, marrying and having kids. But maybe this is all overly pessimistic. Maybe it's stereotyping. Maybe every generation's a mass of differences, simultaneously ahead of its time, of its time, and of the past. Or maybe it's prophetic that our next generation will be dubbed Generation Z; a nation of snoozers. 7.5/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Broad and shallow film directed by Ben Stiller spins an unoriginal and unsurprising tale with characters and situations seen a dozen times before. The only things that have changed are the clothes, the soundtrack, the slang and the cultural references which begin to feel like the film's only purpose for being. This film covers ground so familiar that it's flat and barren. The central characters feel like stand-ins for real people, the romance doesn't spark, and the one-dimensional feel of it all makes this more about Generation ZZZZZZ than X. Not one of the actors has an original or memorable moment or anything of interest to say.

    Look, I get that being a young adult ain't easy, they're a lot of issues in life no matter what age...except for the characters in this movie. Winona Ryder's character (lelaina) is a horrible person who steals 900 dollars from her father...because she's "Rebellious" and Ethan Hawke's character (Troy) is one of the most despicable people ever put to film. Apathetic, pretentious, egotistical, despicable, he's just an awful character. AND YET, these two are our leads who we root for! THESE TWO! Lelaina is a stealing, whiny, pathetic child while Ethan is a lazy, jerk who thinks his music will be his career (ignoring the fact his music makes Creed sound like The Band)hey Ethan, most people who have a music passion tend to have a job so they can support themselves while chasing their dreams...just a thought...oh wait you have parents willing to support you and give you money but they're just "The Man" to you. ugh.... This movie is framed like were supposed to root for these two when characters like this should be framed as if they were the horrible people they are and consequences happen to them (a la Trainspotting) instead they are just two cool rebels...The only three likable characters either get barely any screen time (Janeane Garofolo's character and Steve Zahn who deserved much better) Apparently to this movie, being privileged sucks too...was this movie made by those whiny teenagers in class who make those poems that mean absolutely nothing? But my biggest question is...what is the point of this movie? Was this was meant to be a satire of the 90s? Well it came out too early in 1994 for this to satirize it...but even if it wasn't it was not framed like a satire. It was filmed as a serious movie... Was it to relate to teenagers or young adults? Maybe so but I'd hate to meet the people who are like this, because in real life there are consequences and for stuff like the characters in this movie, it's not a good consequence. Was it too be a nice romantic comedy? Well it fails there amazingly since the characters are so horrible. NO I'll tell you what it's purpose was, CASH! This movie is perfect pandering towards this kind of demographic, let's face it, teenagers are idiots and they will dig this kind of stuff, how ironic that a movie against the man was made by the man (BTW, that's irony Ethan Hawke. Not the actual meaning is the complete opposite of the literal meaning) Now there are people who apparently relate to this movie and say "That's what I was like" IF that's the case 1. NO WAY did you get out of something similar to that without ANY consequences like in this cinematic abomination. 2. Is that really a good thing? Most of the time when you look back on stuff like this you say "Wow...I was a complete idiot." Bottom line...I hate this movie...I hate everything about...The only good acting comes from Jeane, Steve and Ben Stiller (who I forgot to mention gets ridiculed for GASP having a steady, desirable job and being nice!) everyone else is awful, it's shot poorly. If this movie summed up Gen X than thank god we moved on from those days, things were better in those days? If it's like this movie than that is completely wrong!

    This is a film that does not deserve even one star, and although I listed it as such, it really gets zero from me. Simply put, it is the worst film of the 90s. The acting, particularly Hawke and Garafalo, stands out as being lame (Not that I cared about even one character in this film (Which even makes it worse than "Hot Tub Time Machine", who had at least one redeemable character)), and sad to say, the actors operated with a script that no one could possibly salvage. However, what is the worst is how the word "Comedy" pops up in the description of this film. There is not one scene in this film that can be classified as giggle worthy (Let alone funny). It certainly is one of the worst films I have ever saw in my life. The film is brutal, and should be avoided at all costs.

It is not really a review it is more how some films affect us even if they aren't the greatest piece of film history, however generation X and this was surely a glamorized version of it feels like the hippies of the 60's compared to what we are experiencing now. And although the cynic in me says that this film is a bunch of clich&eacute;s at times and characters that are more stereotypical filled with songs that are there to manipulate your emotions I have a soft spot for it since it made me feel something that people would usually experience with theirs favorite band and so on

    this movie made me want to have grown up in the 90s! actually, i was 2yrs old when it came out so i didn't watch it until a few days ago. so obviously i don't know it its depiction of that generation is too accurate. But the thing is that even if on the surface it seems different today, the core of their angst remains the same. as a university student and an "adult" i'm supposed to have everything figured out and be in complete touch with who i really am inside. but the truth is that i'm so far from it, it's a miracle i can make any decisions about my future. i know what i want but i don't exactly who i am. weird, right?! so i really don't think its outdated or too old to relate to. also, i read some of the other reviews that criticized the characters; like how much Ryder's character nags, or how cynical or simply lazy hawk's character is, or how slutty and stereotypical Vicky is. i simply disagree; everyone is annoying and has depression periods in their lives when cant find a job after college, when they had all these hopes and dreams when graduating. troy is not lazy and is not too philosophical, he is simply a smart individual who refuses to get submerged by all those corporate society elements around him. and Vicky is just a normal young woman that works hard (becoming manager of the gap) and plays hard (sexual life and AIDS scare). so instead of looking at it in a really superficial manner, the deeper point of view is fascinating. and the implied meanings (fear, dreams, love, existence,...) with many more reasons, are what makes this one of my favorite movies.

    When I have seen career over views being written about Ben Stiller in various magazines and TV programs,they all mention how he first started out in indie films,before he got discovered by a more "mainstream" audience.After having a look at the back cover,and seeing the very impressive cast listings,I was looking forward to an amazing laugh- riot.Instead,I found the film to be shockingly light on laughs of any kind. The plot: A group of Generation X students graduate from college,and realise the it is time that they all enter the real world,and look for a real job.One of them (Celaina Pierce)has been making a documentary film about her friends,whilst she has been stuck at being an assistant to a TV chat-show host,that cant stand her.Suddenly,a sign of hope appears,when a very trendy music TV producer (Michael Grates) crashes into her car!.Due to how genuinely apologetic Michael seems to be (and also due to him being a producer)Ceclaina shows him the documentary that she has been making.Whilst this should be the first step to a clear path to stardom for Celaina,she sadly,has to decide if she wants to enter the "sell-out mainstream" world,or if she should stick to her Gen X friends.Which include her friend Troy,who is trying to figure out what his true feelings are for her... View on the film: For a film that has such a craving to be seen as part of the early to mid nineties alternative scene,it just feels completely artificial and hollow.One of the things that surprised me was,that apart from a handful of some very good tracks,the film completely skips over making any references to the excellent films,music and novels of the era.Whilst all of the strong cast give acceptable performances,they are sadly let down by the terrible screenplay by Helen Childres.Which includes very badly-written sub-story lines for Celainas friends (a storyline involving Janeane "Larry Sanders" Garofalo,waiting for results on being diagnosed with AIDS,is written as such a minor thing,that it should have been cut out at the earliest stages of the screenplay.)The main romance in the film between Celaina and Troy completely crumbles,due to there hardly being any chemistry between them,and also because Troy is a very nasty egotistical bully threw out the whole film. Final view on the film: A strong cast,let down by a very badly written,completely unfunny screenplay.

    It's like a vortex, the Reality Bites pitch video Ben Stiller's character shows Winona's is actually THIS MOVIE! The writer must've made a checklist of all of the 90's "edgy topics" like AIDS, homosexuality, and then threw in some 80's "parents just don't understand", making for a very after school special like tsunami of cheese. It looks promising from the cover but it's really a Hollywood movie trying to act like an indie flick, a product of grunge being highly marketable that year. It didn't do it for me when I saw its debut at 16, and after giving it another try just now it's even worse than what I remember. I really hope future generations don't refer to this film to see what life was like back then. It doesn't come close to having the same depth John Hughes movies had the previous decade. I guess this is Ben Stiller's directorial debut and I'm so glad he went on to do comedy instead. You can see some of his self deprecating humor when he freaks out at Ethan Hawke's character near the end. I don't know if there is a really definitive Generation X 90's movie, I'd vote Chasing Amy if I had to pick one though.

    Watching cable today, I caught the last 30 mins of Reality Bites starring Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke and Janene Garolfo. Is it me?? Does the entire scene were Michael returns to offer Lelaina some work & Troy makes it OBVIOUS he & Lel is INVOLVED remind U of Prince's film PURPLE RAIN ??? Especially when Troy jumps on stage & begin to expose their sexual exploits causing Lelaina to FLEE from the venue! Remember Prince singing "Darling Nikki" & Appolonia running out of the club?!! This whole scene was literally SNATCHED from Purple Rain. Stiller & Childress ... DO U HAVE NO SHAME ? In their defense, this film certainly lives up to its title! Incidentally . . . the outside camera shot of the venue looks a lot like the music club from Purple Rain too. SMH.

    this movie made me want to have grown up in the 90s! actually, i was 2yrs old when it came out so i didn't watch it until a few days ago. so obviously i don't know it its depiction of that generation is too accurate. But the thing is that even if on the surface it seems different today, the core of their angst remains the same. as a university student and an "adult" i'm supposed to have everything figured out and be in complete touch with who i really am inside. but the truth is that i'm so far from it, it's a miracle i can make any decisions about my future. i know what i want but i don't exactly who i am. weird, right?! so i really don't think its outdated or too old to relate to. also, i read some of the other reviews that criticized the characters; like how much Ryder's character nags, or how cynical or simply lazy hawk's character is, or how slutty and stereotypical Vicky is. i simply disagree; everyone is annoying and has depression periods in their lives when cant find a job after college, when they had all these hopes and dreams when graduating. troy is not lazy and is not too philosophical, he is simply a smart individual who refuses to get submerged by all those corporate society elements around him. and Vicky is just a normal young woman that works hard (becoming manager of the gap) and plays hard (sexual life and AIDS scare). so instead of looking at it in a really superficial manner, the deeper point of view is fascinating. and the implied meanings (fear, dreams, love, existence,...) with many more reasons, are what makes this one of my favorite movies.

    When I have seen career over views being written about Ben Stiller in various magazines and TV programs,they all mention how he first started out in indie films,before he got discovered by a more "mainstream" audience.After having a look at the back cover,and seeing the very impressive cast listings,I was looking forward to an amazing laugh- riot.Instead,I found the film to be shockingly light on laughs of any kind. The plot: A group of Generation X students graduate from college,and realise the it is time that they all enter the real world,and look for a real job.One of them (Celaina Pierce)has been making a documentary film about her friends,whilst she has been stuck at being an assistant to a TV chat-show host,that cant stand her.Suddenly,a sign of hope appears,when a very trendy music TV producer (Michael Grates) crashes into her car!.Due to how genuinely apologetic Michael seems to be (and also due to him being a producer)Ceclaina shows him the documentary that she has been making.Whilst this should be the first step to a clear path to stardom for Celaina,she sadly,has to decide if she wants to enter the "sell-out mainstream" world,or if she should stick to her Gen X friends.Which include her friend Troy,who is trying to figure out what his true feelings are for her... View on the film: For a film that has such a craving to be seen as part of the early to mid nineties alternative scene,it just feels completely artificial and hollow.One of the things that surprised me was,that apart from a handful of some very good tracks,the film completely skips over making any references to the excellent films,music and novels of the era.Whilst all of the strong cast give acceptable performances,they are sadly let down by the terrible screenplay by Helen Childres.Which includes very badly-written sub-story lines for Celainas friends (a storyline involving Janeane "Larry Sanders" Garofalo,waiting for results on being diagnosed with AIDS,is written as such a minor thing,that it should have been cut out at the earliest stages of the screenplay.)The main romance in the film between Celaina and Troy completely crumbles,due to there hardly being any chemistry between them,and also because Troy is a very nasty egotistical bully threw out the whole film. Final view on the film: A strong cast,let down by a very badly written,completely unfunny screenplay.

    It's like a vortex, the Reality Bites pitch video Ben Stiller's character shows Winona's is actually THIS MOVIE! The writer must've made a checklist of all of the 90's "edgy topics" like AIDS, homosexuality, and then threw in some 80's "parents just don't understand", making for a very after school special like tsunami of cheese. It looks promising from the cover but it's really a Hollywood movie trying to act like an indie flick, a product of grunge being highly marketable that year. It didn't do it for me when I saw its debut at 16, and after giving it another try just now it's even worse than what I remember. I really hope future generations don't refer to this film to see what life was like back then. It doesn't come close to having the same depth John Hughes movies had the previous decade. I guess this is Ben Stiller's directorial debut and I'm so glad he went on to do comedy instead. You can see some of his self deprecating humor when he freaks out at Ethan Hawke's character near the end. I don't know if there is a really definitive Generation X 90's movie, I'd vote Chasing Amy if I had to pick one though.

    Watching cable today, I caught the last 30 mins of Reality Bites starring Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke and Janene Garolfo. Is it me?? Does the entire scene were Michael returns to offer Lelaina some work & Troy makes it OBVIOUS he & Lel is INVOLVED remind U of Prince's film PURPLE RAIN ??? Especially when Troy jumps on stage & begin to expose their sexual exploits causing Lelaina to FLEE from the venue! Remember Prince singing "Darling Nikki" & Appolonia running out of the club?!! This whole scene was literally SNATCHED from Purple Rain. Stiller & Childress ... DO U HAVE NO SHAME ? In their defense, this film certainly lives up to its title! Incidentally . . . the outside camera shot of the venue looks a lot like the music club from Purple Rain too. SMH.

    I love this film; Ethan Hawke is brilliant and really does sum up the 'searcher' generation, the new Beat. Grunge in this film is typified by over-intelligent, under-achieving, dope induced philosophical musings and desire to make a difference but not knowing how to go about it in world where young people feel anonymous and disenfranchised and dealing with modern day issues; coming out, HIV tests, unemployment, friendship, love and life aspirations. I think this is perfectly cast, loads of familiar faces, and I think this is my favourite role of Winona Ryder. Steve Zahn and Janeane Garofalo were great and Ben Stiller (who also directed) is very good in this, again one of his best roles but Ethan Hawke is the deserved lead in this snapshot of reality. Everyone is good in this, and there are truisms left right and centre - it speaks to the heart & soul and is relevant to my generation and I'm sure has relevance to later decades and has - IMHO - aged well. It is super-funny, touching and enlightening; something for everyone who's young and old enough. Even after 20 years it's one of my favourite films.

    "None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free." - Goethe "Work Makes Freedom" - sign above Auschwitz entrance The directorial debut of Ben Stiller, "Reality Bites" is a well meaning but slight film which hopes to capture the tempo and anxieties of Generation X. The film revolves around a small cast of young adults (Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, Ben Stiller, Steve Zahn), all of whom are raging caricatures. There's the artist, the sex junkie, the drop out, the corporate sell out and of course the always-precious Winona Ryder, who serves as our window into their world. She faces well worn conflicts: does she pursue a career in the arts, or trade her dreams and aspirations for a "reliable" corporate job? Does she settle down with a "loser" musician, or a likable but stiff businessman in a suit? At the heart of the film is therefore a tug-of-war between the logic and rationales of techno capitalism and the sensitive soul's vague yearnings for something else. Whilst the film is absent of analysis or serious insight, it does capture a certain relevant vacuity. Stiller's whiny young adults hang in limbo, aimless, lethargic, high-strung and always placating themselves with material or biochemical pleasures. Deeming the adult world abhorrent, they flutter in the wind, unable to function in it, but unable to conceive of, latch onto or find something else. Other anxieties abound: fears of rejection, poverty, success and judgement turn all these characters into emotion wrecks. They're stuck in post graduate delirium and quarter life crises, some pushed into self promotion, solipsism and competition, others opting to instead drop out of the game altogether. Like all these films, "Reality Bites" turns its back on a deeper reality. It ignores the fact that its anxieties are essentially social symptoms spawned by social systems. Indeed, our very neurological structure is closely tied to, and is necessarily continuous with, environmental relations, which are themselves directly responsible for certain neurological or synaptic connections flourishing or atrophying and dying off. In a very real sense, you are continually being built by the "outside". By individualising what is systemic, these films thus override the possibility of their subjects becoming agents, rather than patients, of their symptoms. Whilst there are hundreds of films like "Reality Bites" about Generation's Xers, Generation Y's anxieties don't seem to make it to cinema screens. Maybe they've been completely inculcated, have self medicated themselves into zombiedom, or simply have no use for cinema, the stuffy medium of their forefathers. Perhaps with interactive media supplanting old media, the quaint idea of stories, and even the audience/object dichotomy itself, is displaced by a situation in which the anxiety tale is writ on the subject itself; their virtual and real bodies are the new anxiety performance. Cynicism and irony were a huge part of Generation X's identity. They saw the ideals, dreams and possibilities of the Baby Boomers get thoroughly squashed. The result was a generation which recognised the "reality" that rebellion and honest dissent would either fail or make one a laughing stock. Authentic emotional expression was to be buried or cocooned in irony/cynicism, lest one risk ridicule or hurt. But Generation X at least knew how to smell BS. Generation Y's thoroughly of the post-everything, multicultural, accept-everything entertainment world. They're both stronger and more fragile, supremely confident and well adjusted, but perhaps with a nihilism buried so deep they're not even aware of it, shuffling off to the abattoir with smiling faces, heads bobbing to personalised play-lists. No surprise that The Journal of Social Psychology reports that Millennials think about social problems less, have less interest in government, family and community, and have a very inflated sense of self which in turn leads to unrealistic expectations and chronic disappointment. They're also pushing back each of the five milestones of adulthood: completing school, leaving home, becoming financially independent, marrying and having kids. But maybe this is all overly pessimistic. Maybe it's stereotyping. Maybe every generation's a mass of differences, simultaneously ahead of its time, of its time, and of the past. Or maybe it's prophetic that our next generation will be dubbed Generation Z; a nation of snoozers. 7.5/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Broad and shallow film directed by Ben Stiller spins an unoriginal and unsurprising tale with characters and situations seen a dozen times before. The only things that have changed are the clothes, the soundtrack, the slang and the cultural references which begin to feel like the film's only purpose for being. This film covers ground so familiar that it's flat and barren. The central characters feel like stand-ins for real people, the romance doesn't spark, and the one-dimensional feel of it all makes this more about Generation ZZZZZZ than X. Not one of the actors has an original or memorable moment or anything of interest to say.

    Look, I get that being a young adult ain't easy, they're a lot of issues in life no matter what age...except for the characters in this movie. Winona Ryder's character (lelaina) is a horrible person who steals 900 dollars from her father...because she's "Rebellious" and Ethan Hawke's character (Troy) is one of the most despicable people ever put to film. Apathetic, pretentious, egotistical, despicable, he's just an awful character. AND YET, these two are our leads who we root for! THESE TWO! Lelaina is a stealing, whiny, pathetic child while Ethan is a lazy, jerk who thinks his music will be his career (ignoring the fact his music makes Creed sound like The Band)hey Ethan, most people who have a music passion tend to have a job so they can support themselves while chasing their dreams...just a thought...oh wait you have parents willing to support you and give you money but they're just "The Man" to you. ugh.... This movie is framed like were supposed to root for these two when characters like this should be framed as if they were the horrible people they are and consequences happen to them (a la Trainspotting) instead they are just two cool rebels...The only three likable characters either get barely any screen time (Janeane Garofolo's character and Steve Zahn who deserved much better) Apparently to this movie, being privileged sucks too...was this movie made by those whiny teenagers in class who make those poems that mean absolutely nothing? But my biggest question is...what is the point of this movie? Was this was meant to be a satire of the 90s? Well it came out too early in 1994 for this to satirize it...but even if it wasn't it was not framed like a satire. It was filmed as a serious movie... Was it to relate to teenagers or young adults? Maybe so but I'd hate to meet the people who are like this, because in real life there are consequences and for stuff like the characters in this movie, it's not a good consequence. Was it too be a nice romantic comedy? Well it fails there amazingly since the characters are so horrible. NO I'll tell you what it's purpose was, CASH! This movie is perfect pandering towards this kind of demographic, let's face it, teenagers are idiots and they will dig this kind of stuff, how ironic that a movie against the man was made by the man (BTW, that's irony Ethan Hawke. Not the actual meaning is the complete opposite of the literal meaning) Now there are people who apparently relate to this movie and say "That's what I was like" IF that's the case 1. NO WAY did you get out of something similar to that without ANY consequences like in this cinematic abomination. 2. Is that really a good thing? Most of the time when you look back on stuff like this you say "Wow...I was a complete idiot." Bottom line...I hate this movie...I hate everything about...The only good acting comes from Jeane, Steve and Ben Stiller (who I forgot to mention gets ridiculed for GASP having a steady, desirable job and being nice!) everyone else is awful, it's shot poorly. If this movie summed up Gen X than thank god we moved on from those days, things were better in those days? If it's like this movie than that is completely wrong!

    This is a film that does not deserve even one star, and although I listed it as such, it really gets zero from me. Simply put, it is the worst film of the 90s. The acting, particularly Hawke and Garafalo, stands out as being lame (Not that I cared about even one character in this film (Which even makes it worse than "Hot Tub Time Machine", who had at least one redeemable character)), and sad to say, the actors operated with a script that no one could possibly salvage. However, what is the worst is how the word "Comedy" pops up in the description of this film. There is not one scene in this film that can be classified as giggle worthy (Let alone funny). It certainly is one of the worst films I have ever saw in my life. The film is brutal, and should be avoided at all costs.

    http:// storiestoriesdk.wordpress.com/2011/08/20/ reality-will-bite-eventually/ Hi everyone , since this movie marked my teenage years in a way and today I got a little nostalgic a text for that in my blog feel free to read it and tell my what you think. It is not really a review it is more how some films affect us even if they aren't the greatest piece of film history, however generation X and this was surely a glamorized version of it feels like the hippies of the 60's compared to what we are experiencing now. And although the cynic in me says that this film is a bunch of clich&eacute;s at times and characters that are more stereotypical filled with songs that are there to manipulate your emotions I have a soft spot for it since it made me feel something that people would usually experience with theirs favorite band and so on

She faces well worn conflicts: does she pursue a career in the arts, or trade her dreams and aspirations for a "reliable" corporate job?

But maybe this is all overly pessimistic. Maybe it's stereotyping. Maybe every generation's a mass of differences, simultaneously ahead of its time, of its time, and of the past. Or maybe it's prophetic that our next generation will be dubbed Generation Z; a nation of snoozers. 7.5/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Broad and shallow film directed by Ben Stiller spins an unoriginal and unsurprising tale with characters and situations seen a dozen times before. The only things that have changed are the clothes, the soundtrack, the slang and the cultural references which begin to feel like the film's only purpose for being. This film covers ground so familiar that it's flat and barren. The central characters feel like stand-ins for real people, the romance doesn't spark, and the one-dimensional feel of it all makes this more about Generation ZZZZZZ than X. Not one of the actors has an original or memorable moment or anything of interest to say.

    Look, I get that being a young adult ain't easy, they're a lot of issues in life no matter what age...except for the characters in this movie. Winona Ryder's character (lelaina) is a horrible person who steals 900 dollars from her father...because she's "Rebellious" and Ethan Hawke's character (Troy) is one of the most despicable people ever put to film. Apathetic, pretentious, egotistical, despicable, he's just an awful character. AND YET, these two are our leads who we root for! THESE TWO! Lelaina is a stealing, whiny, pathetic child while Ethan is a lazy, jerk who thinks his music will be his career (ignoring the fact his music makes Creed sound like The Band)hey Ethan, most people who have a music passion tend to have a job so they can support themselves while chasing their dreams...just a thought...oh wait you have parents willing to support you and give you money but they're just "The Man" to you. ugh.... This movie is framed like were supposed to root for these two when characters like this should be framed as if they were the horrible people they are and consequences happen to them (a la Trainspotting) instead they are just two cool rebels...The only three likable characters either get barely any screen time (Janeane Garofolo's character and Steve Zahn who deserved much better) Apparently to this movie, being privileged sucks too...was this movie made by those whiny teenagers in class who make those poems that mean absolutely nothing? But my biggest question is...what is the point of this movie? Was this was meant to be a satire of the 90s? Well it came out too early in 1994 for this to satirize it...but even if it wasn't it was not framed like a satire. It was filmed as a serious movie... Was it to relate to teenagers or young adults? Maybe so but I'd hate to meet the people who are like this, because in real life there are consequences and for stuff like the characters in this movie, it's not a good consequence. Was it too be a nice romantic comedy? Well it fails there amazingly since the characters are so horrible. NO I'll tell you what it's purpose was, CASH! This movie is perfect pandering towards this kind of demographic, let's face it, teenagers are idiots and they will dig this kind of stuff, how ironic that a movie against the man was made by the man (BTW, that's irony Ethan Hawke. Not the actual meaning is the complete opposite of the literal meaning) Now there are people who apparently relate to this movie and say "That's what I was like" IF that's the case 1. NO WAY did you get out of something similar to that without ANY consequences like in this cinematic abomination. 2. Is that really a good thing? Most of the time when you look back on stuff like this you say "Wow...I was a complete idiot." Bottom line...I hate this movie...I hate everything about...The only good acting comes from Jeane, Steve and Ben Stiller (who I forgot to mention gets ridiculed for GASP having a steady, desirable job and being nice!) everyone else is awful, it's shot poorly. If this movie summed up Gen X than thank god we moved on from those days, things were better in those days? If it's like this movie than that is completely wrong!

    This is a film that does not deserve even one star, and although I listed it as such, it really gets zero from me. Simply put, it is the worst film of the 90s. The acting, particularly Hawke and Garafalo, stands out as being lame (Not that I cared about even one character in this film (Which even makes it worse than "Hot Tub Time Machine", who had at least one redeemable character)), and sad to say, the actors operated with a script that no one could possibly salvage. However, what is the worst is how the word "Comedy" pops up in the description of this film. There is not one scene in this film that can be classified as giggle worthy (Let alone funny). It certainly is one of the worst films I have ever saw in my life. The film is brutal, and should be avoided at all costs.

It is not really a review it is more how some films affect us even if they aren't the greatest piece of film history, however generation X and this was surely a glamorized version of it feels like the hippies of the 60's compared to what we are experiencing now. And although the cynic in me says that this film is a bunch of clich&eacute;s at times and characters that are more stereotypical filled with songs that are there to manipulate your emotions I have a soft spot for it since it made me feel something that people would usually experience with theirs favorite band and so on

    this movie made me want to have grown up in the 90s! actually, i was 2yrs old when it came out so i didn't watch it until a few days ago. so obviously i don't know it its depiction of that generation is too accurate. But the thing is that even if on the surface it seems different today, the core of their angst remains the same. as a university student and an "adult" i'm supposed to have everything figured out and be in complete touch with who i really am inside. but the truth is that i'm so far from it, it's a miracle i can make any decisions about my future. i know what i want but i don't exactly who i am. weird, right?! so i really don't think its outdated or too old to relate to. also, i read some of the other reviews that criticized the characters; like how much Ryder's character nags, or how cynical or simply lazy hawk's character is, or how slutty and stereotypical Vicky is. i simply disagree; everyone is annoying and has depression periods in their lives when cant find a job after college, when they had all these hopes and dreams when graduating. troy is not lazy and is not too philosophical, he is simply a smart individual who refuses to get submerged by all those corporate society elements around him. and Vicky is just a normal young woman that works hard (becoming manager of the gap) and plays hard (sexual life and AIDS scare). so instead of looking at it in a really superficial manner, the deeper point of view is fascinating. and the implied meanings (fear, dreams, love, existence,...) with many more reasons, are what makes this one of my favorite movies.

    When I have seen career over views being written about Ben Stiller in various magazines and TV programs,they all mention how he first started out in indie films,before he got discovered by a more "mainstream" audience.After having a look at the back cover,and seeing the very impressive cast listings,I was looking forward to an amazing laugh- riot.Instead,I found the film to be shockingly light on laughs of any kind. The plot: A group of Generation X students graduate from college,and realise the it is time that they all enter the real world,and look for a real job.One of them (Celaina Pierce)has been making a documentary film about her friends,whilst she has been stuck at being an assistant to a TV chat-show host,that cant stand her.Suddenly,a sign of hope appears,when a very trendy music TV producer (Michael Grates) crashes into her car!.Due to how genuinely apologetic Michael seems to be (and also due to him being a producer)Ceclaina shows him the documentary that she has been making.Whilst this should be the first step to a clear path to stardom for Celaina,she sadly,has to decide if she wants to enter the "sell-out mainstream" world,or if she should stick to her Gen X friends.Which include her friend Troy,who is trying to figure out what his true feelings are for her... View on the film: For a film that has such a craving to be seen as part of the early to mid nineties alternative scene,it just feels completely artificial and hollow.One of the things that surprised me was,that apart from a handful of some very good tracks,the film completely skips over making any references to the excellent films,music and novels of the era.Whilst all of the strong cast give acceptable performances,they are sadly let down by the terrible screenplay by Helen Childres.Which includes very badly-written sub-story lines for Celainas friends (a storyline involving Janeane "Larry Sanders" Garofalo,waiting for results on being diagnosed with AIDS,is written as such a minor thing,that it should have been cut out at the earliest stages of the screenplay.)The main romance in the film between Celaina and Troy completely crumbles,due to there hardly being any chemistry between them,and also because Troy is a very nasty egotistical bully threw out the whole film. Final view on the film: A strong cast,let down by a very badly written,completely unfunny screenplay.

    It's like a vortex, the Reality Bites pitch video Ben Stiller's character shows Winona's is actually THIS MOVIE! The writer must've made a checklist of all of the 90's "edgy topics" like AIDS, homosexuality, and then threw in some 80's "parents just don't understand", making for a very after school special like tsunami of cheese. It looks promising from the cover but it's really a Hollywood movie trying to act like an indie flick, a product of grunge being highly marketable that year. It didn't do it for me when I saw its debut at 16, and after giving it another try just now it's even worse than what I remember. I really hope future generations don't refer to this film to see what life was like back then. It doesn't come close to having the same depth John Hughes movies had the previous decade. I guess this is Ben Stiller's directorial debut and I'm so glad he went on to do comedy instead. You can see some of his self deprecating humor when he freaks out at Ethan Hawke's character near the end. I don't know if there is a really definitive Generation X 90's movie, I'd vote Chasing Amy if I had to pick one though.

    Watching cable today, I caught the last 30 mins of Reality Bites starring Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke and Janene Garolfo. Is it me?? Does the entire scene were Michael returns to offer Lelaina some work & Troy makes it OBVIOUS he & Lel is INVOLVED remind U of Prince's film PURPLE RAIN ??? Especially when Troy jumps on stage & begin to expose their sexual exploits causing Lelaina to FLEE from the venue! Remember Prince singing "Darling Nikki" & Appolonia running out of the club?!! This whole scene was literally SNATCHED from Purple Rain. Stiller & Childress ... DO U HAVE NO SHAME ? In their defense, this film certainly lives up to its title! Incidentally . . . the outside camera shot of the venue looks a lot like the music club from Purple Rain too. SMH.

    I love this film; Ethan Hawke is brilliant and really does sum up the 'searcher' generation, the new Beat. Grunge in this film is typified by over-intelligent, under-achieving, dope induced philosophical musings and desire to make a difference but not knowing how to go about it in world where young people feel anonymous and disenfranchised and dealing with modern day issues; coming out, HIV tests, unemployment, friendship, love and life aspirations. I think this is perfectly cast, loads of familiar faces, and I think this is my favourite role of Winona Ryder. Steve Zahn and Janeane Garofalo were great and Ben Stiller (who also directed) is very good in this, again one of his best roles but Ethan Hawke is the deserved lead in this snapshot of reality. Everyone is good in this, and there are truisms left right and centre - it speaks to the heart & soul and is relevant to my generation and I'm sure has relevance to later decades and has - IMHO - aged well. It is super-funny, touching and enlightening; something for everyone who's young and old enough. Even after 20 years it's one of my favourite films.

    "None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free." - Goethe "Work Makes Freedom" - sign above Auschwitz entrance The directorial debut of Ben Stiller, "Reality Bites" is a well meaning but slight film which hopes to capture the tempo and anxieties of Generation X. The film revolves around a small cast of young adults (Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, Ben Stiller, Steve Zahn), all of whom are raging caricatures. There's the artist, the sex junkie, the drop out, the corporate sell out and of course the always-precious Winona Ryder, who serves as our window into their world. She faces well worn conflicts: does she pursue a career in the arts, or trade her dreams and aspirations for a "reliable" corporate job? Does she settle down with a "loser" musician, or a likable but stiff businessman in a suit? At the heart of the film is therefore a tug-of-war between the logic and rationales of techno capitalism and the sensitive soul's vague yearnings for something else. Whilst the film is absent of analysis or serious insight, it does capture a certain relevant vacuity. Stiller's whiny young adults hang in limbo, aimless, lethargic, high-strung and always placating themselves with material or biochemical pleasures. Deeming the adult world abhorrent, they flutter in the wind, unable to function in it, but unable to conceive of, latch onto or find something else. Other anxieties abound: fears of rejection, poverty, success and judgement turn all these characters into emotion wrecks. They're stuck in post graduate delirium and quarter life crises, some pushed into self promotion, solipsism and competition, others opting to instead drop out of the game altogether. Like all these films, "Reality Bites" turns its back on a deeper reality. It ignores the fact that its anxieties are essentially social symptoms spawned by social systems. Indeed, our very neurological structure is closely tied to, and is necessarily continuous with, environmental relations, which are themselves directly responsible for certain neurological or synaptic connections flourishing or atrophying and dying off. In a very real sense, you are continually being built by the "outside". By individualising what is systemic, these films thus override the possibility of their subjects becoming agents, rather than patients, of their symptoms. Whilst there are hundreds of films like "Reality Bites" about Generation's Xers, Generation Y's anxieties don't seem to make it to cinema screens. Maybe they've been completely inculcated, have self medicated themselves into zombiedom, or simply have no use for cinema, the stuffy medium of their forefathers. Perhaps with interactive media supplanting old media, the quaint idea of stories, and even the audience/object dichotomy itself, is displaced by a situation in which the anxiety tale is writ on the subject itself; their virtual and real bodies are the new anxiety performance. Cynicism and irony were a huge part of Generation X's identity. They saw the ideals, dreams and possibilities of the Baby Boomers get thoroughly squashed. The result was a generation which recognised the "reality" that rebellion and honest dissent would either fail or make one a laughing stock. Authentic emotional expression was to be buried or cocooned in irony/cynicism, lest one risk ridicule or hurt. But Generation X at least knew how to smell BS. Generation Y's thoroughly of the post-everything, multicultural, accept-everything entertainment world. They're both stronger and more fragile, supremely confident and well adjusted, but perhaps with a nihilism buried so deep they're not even aware of it, shuffling off to the abattoir with smiling faces, heads bobbing to personalised play-lists. No surprise that The Journal of Social Psychology reports that Millennials think about social problems less, have less interest in government, family and community, and have a very inflated sense of self which in turn leads to unrealistic expectations and chronic disappointment. They're also pushing back each of the five milestones of adulthood: completing school, leaving home, becoming financially independent, marrying and having kids. But maybe this is all overly pessimistic. Maybe it's stereotyping. Maybe every generation's a mass of differences, simultaneously ahead of its time, of its time, and of the past. Or maybe it's prophetic that our next generation will be dubbed Generation Z; a nation of snoozers. 7.5/10 - Worth one viewing.

The writer must've made a checklist of all of the 90's "edgy topics" like AIDS, homosexuality, and then threw in some 80's "parents just don't understand", making for a very after school special like tsunami of cheese. It looks promising from the cover but it's really a Hollywood movie trying to act like an indie flick, a product of grunge being highly marketable that year. It didn't do it for me when I saw its debut at 16, and after giving it another try just now it's even worse than what I remember. I really hope future generations don't refer to this film to see what life was like back then. It doesn't come close to having the same depth John Hughes movies had the previous decade. I guess this is Ben Stiller's directorial debut and I'm so glad he went on to do comedy instead. You can see some of his self deprecating humor when he freaks out at Ethan Hawke's character near the end. I don't know if there is a really definitive Generation X 90's movie, I'd vote Chasing Amy if I had to pick one though.

    Watching cable today, I caught the last 30 mins of Reality Bites starring Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke and Janene Garolfo. Is it me?? Does the entire scene were Michael returns to offer Lelaina some work & Troy makes it OBVIOUS he & Lel is INVOLVED remind U of Prince's film PURPLE RAIN ??? Especially when Troy jumps on stage & begin to expose their sexual exploits causing Lelaina to FLEE from the venue! Remember Prince singing "Darling Nikki" & Appolonia running out of the club?!! This whole scene was literally SNATCHED from Purple Rain. Stiller & Childress ... DO U HAVE NO SHAME ? In their defense, this film certainly lives up to its title! Incidentally . . . the outside camera shot of the venue looks a lot like the music club from Purple Rain too. SMH.

    I love this film; Ethan Hawke is brilliant and really does sum up the 'searcher' generation, the new Beat. Grunge in this film is typified by over-intelligent, under-achieving, dope induced philosophical musings and desire to make a difference but not knowing how to go about it in world where young people feel anonymous and disenfranchised and dealing with modern day issues; coming out, HIV tests, unemployment, friendship, love and life aspirations. I think this is perfectly cast, loads of familiar faces, and I think this is my favourite role of Winona Ryder. Steve Zahn and Janeane Garofalo were great and Ben Stiller (who also directed) is very good in this, again one of his best roles but Ethan Hawke is the deserved lead in this snapshot of reality. Everyone is good in this, and there are truisms left right and centre - it speaks to the heart & soul and is relevant to my generation and I'm sure has relevance to later decades and has - IMHO - aged well. It is super-funny, touching and enlightening; something for everyone who's young and old enough. Even after 20 years it's one of my favourite films.

    "None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free." - Goethe "Work Makes Freedom" - sign above Auschwitz entrance The directorial debut of Ben Stiller, "Reality Bites" is a well meaning but slight film which hopes to capture the tempo and anxieties of Generation X. The film revolves around a small cast of young adults (Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, Ben Stiller, Steve Zahn), all of whom are raging caricatures. There's the artist, the sex junkie, the drop out, the corporate sell out and of course the always-precious Winona Ryder, who serves as our window into their world. She faces well worn conflicts: does she pursue a career in the arts, or trade her dreams and aspirations for a "reliable" corporate job? Does she settle down with a "loser" musician, or a likable but stiff businessman in a suit? At the heart of the film is therefore a tug-of-war between the logic and rationales of techno capitalism and the sensitive soul's vague yearnings for something else. Whilst the film is absent of analysis or serious insight, it does capture a certain relevant vacuity. Stiller's whiny young adults hang in limbo, aimless, lethargic, high-strung and always placating themselves with material or biochemical pleasures. Deeming the adult world abhorrent, they flutter in the wind, unable to function in it, but unable to conceive of, latch onto or find something else. Other anxieties abound: fears of rejection, poverty, success and judgement turn all these characters into emotion wrecks. They're stuck in post graduate delirium and quarter life crises, some pushed into self promotion, solipsism and competition, others opting to instead drop out of the game altogether. Like all these films, "Reality Bites" turns its back on a deeper reality. It ignores the fact that its anxieties are essentially social symptoms spawned by social systems. Indeed, our very neurological structure is closely tied to, and is necessarily continuous with, environmental relations, which are themselves directly responsible for certain neurological or synaptic connections flourishing or atrophying and dying off. In a very real sense, you are continually being built by the "outside". By individualising what is systemic, these films thus override the possibility of their subjects becoming agents, rather than patients, of their symptoms. Whilst there are hundreds of films like "Reality Bites" about Generation's Xers, Generation Y's anxieties don't seem to make it to cinema screens. Maybe they've been completely inculcated, have self medicated themselves into zombiedom, or simply have no use for cinema, the stuffy medium of their forefathers. Perhaps with interactive media supplanting old media, the quaint idea of stories, and even the audience/object dichotomy itself, is displaced by a situation in which the anxiety tale is writ on the subject itself; their virtual and real bodies are the new anxiety performance. Cynicism and irony were a huge part of Generation X's identity. They saw the ideals, dreams and possibilities of the Baby Boomers get thoroughly squashed. The result was a generation which recognised the "reality" that rebellion and honest dissent would either fail or make one a laughing stock. Authentic emotional expression was to be buried or cocooned in irony/cynicism, lest one risk ridicule or hurt. But Generation X at least knew how to smell BS. Generation Y's thoroughly of the post-everything, multicultural, accept-everything entertainment world. They're both stronger and more fragile, supremely confident and well adjusted, but perhaps with a nihilism buried so deep they're not even aware of it, shuffling off to the abattoir with smiling faces, heads bobbing to personalised play-lists. No surprise that The Journal of Social Psychology reports that Millennials think about social problems less, have less interest in government, family and community, and have a very inflated sense of self which in turn leads to unrealistic expectations and chronic disappointment. They're also pushing back each of the five milestones of adulthood: completing school, leaving home, becoming financially independent, marrying and having kids. But maybe this is all overly pessimistic. Maybe it's stereotyping. Maybe every generation's a mass of differences, simultaneously ahead of its time, of its time, and of the past. Or maybe it's prophetic that our next generation will be dubbed Generation Z; a nation of snoozers. 7.5/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Broad and shallow film directed by Ben Stiller spins an unoriginal and unsurprising tale with characters and situations seen a dozen times before. The only things that have changed are the clothes, the soundtrack, the slang and the cultural references which begin to feel like the film's only purpose for being. This film covers ground so familiar that it's flat and barren. The central characters feel like stand-ins for real people, the romance doesn't spark, and the one-dimensional feel of it all makes this more about Generation ZZZZZZ than X. Not one of the actors has an original or memorable moment or anything of interest to say.

    Look, I get that being a young adult ain't easy, they're a lot of issues in life no matter what age...except for the characters in this movie. Winona Ryder's character (lelaina) is a horrible person who steals 900 dollars from her father...because she's "Rebellious" and Ethan Hawke's character (Troy) is one of the most despicable people ever put to film. Apathetic, pretentious, egotistical, despicable, he's just an awful character. AND YET, these two are our leads who we root for! THESE TWO! Lelaina is a stealing, whiny, pathetic child while Ethan is a lazy, jerk who thinks his music will be his career (ignoring the fact his music makes Creed sound like The Band)hey Ethan, most people who have a music passion tend to have a job so they can support themselves while chasing their dreams...just a thought...oh wait you have parents willing to support you and give you money but they're just "The Man" to you. ugh.... This movie is framed like were supposed to root for these two when characters like this should be framed as if they were the horrible people they are and consequences happen to them (a la Trainspotting) instead they are just two cool rebels...The only three likable characters either get barely any screen time (Janeane Garofolo's character and Steve Zahn who deserved much better) Apparently to this movie, being privileged sucks too...was this movie made by those whiny teenagers in class who make those poems that mean absolutely nothing? But my biggest question is...what is the point of this movie? Was this was meant to be a satire of the 90s? Well it came out too early in 1994 for this to satirize it...but even if it wasn't it was not framed like a satire. It was filmed as a serious movie... Was it to relate to teenagers or young adults? Maybe so but I'd hate to meet the people who are like this, because in real life there are consequences and for stuff like the characters in this movie, it's not a good consequence. Was it too be a nice romantic comedy? Well it fails there amazingly since the characters are so horrible. NO I'll tell you what it's purpose was, CASH! This movie is perfect pandering towards this kind of demographic, let's face it, teenagers are idiots and they will dig this kind of stuff, how ironic that a movie against the man was made by the man (BTW, that's irony Ethan Hawke. Not the actual meaning is the complete opposite of the literal meaning) Now there are people who apparently relate to this movie and say "That's what I was like" IF that's the case 1. NO WAY did you get out of something similar to that without ANY consequences like in this cinematic abomination. 2. Is that really a good thing? Most of the time when you look back on stuff like this you say "Wow...I was a complete idiot." Bottom line...I hate this movie...I hate everything about...The only good acting comes from Jeane, Steve and Ben Stiller (who I forgot to mention gets ridiculed for GASP having a steady, desirable job and being nice!) everyone else is awful, it's shot poorly. If this movie summed up Gen X than thank god we moved on from those days, things were better in those days? If it's like this movie than that is completely wrong!

    This is a film that does not deserve even one star, and although I listed it as such, it really gets zero from me. Simply put, it is the worst film of the 90s. The acting, particularly Hawke and Garafalo, stands out as being lame (Not that I cared about even one character in this film (Which even makes it worse than "Hot Tub Time Machine", who had at least one redeemable character)), and sad to say, the actors operated with a script that no one could possibly salvage. However, what is the worst is how the word "Comedy" pops up in the description of this film. There is not one scene in this film that can be classified as giggle worthy (Let alone funny). It certainly is one of the worst films I have ever saw in my life. The film is brutal, and should be avoided at all costs.

    http:// storiestoriesdk.wordpress.com/2011/08/20/ reality-will-bite-eventually/ Hi everyone , since this movie marked my teenage years in a way and today I got a little nostalgic a text for that in my blog feel free to read it and tell my what you think. It is not really a review it is more how some films affect us even if they aren't the greatest piece of film history, however generation X and this was surely a glamorized version of it feels like the hippies of the 60's compared to what we are experiencing now. And although the cynic in me says that this film is a bunch of clich&eacute;s at times and characters that are more stereotypical filled with songs that are there to manipulate your emotions I have a soft spot for it since it made me feel something that people would usually experience with theirs favorite band and so on

    this movie made me want to have grown up in the 90s! actually, i was 2yrs old when it came out so i didn't watch it until a few days ago. so obviously i don't know it its depiction of that generation is too accurate. But the thing is that even if on the surface it seems different today, the core of their angst remains the same. as a university student and an "adult" i'm supposed to have everything figured out and be in complete touch with who i really am inside. but the truth is that i'm so far from it, it's a miracle i can make any decisions about my future. i know what i want but i don't exactly who i am. weird, right?! so i really don't think its outdated or too old to relate to. also, i read some of the other reviews that criticized the characters; like how much Ryder's character nags, or how cynical or simply lazy hawk's character is, or how slutty and stereotypical Vicky is. i simply disagree; everyone is annoying and has depression periods in their lives when cant find a job after college, when they had all these hopes and dreams when graduating. troy is not lazy and is not too philosophical, he is simply a smart individual who refuses to get submerged by all those corporate society elements around him. and Vicky is just a normal young woman that works hard (becoming manager of the gap) and plays hard (sexual life and AIDS scare). so instead of looking at it in a really superficial manner, the deeper point of view is fascinating. and the implied meanings (fear, dreams, love, existence,...) with many more reasons, are what makes this one of my favorite movies.

    When I have seen career over views being written about Ben Stiller in various magazines and TV programs,they all mention how he first started out in indie films,before he got discovered by a more "mainstream" audience.After having a look at the back cover,and seeing the very impressive cast listings,I was looking forward to an amazing laugh- riot.Instead,I found the film to be shockingly light on laughs of any kind. The plot: A group of Generation X students graduate from college,and realise the it is time that they all enter the real world,and look for a real job.One of them (Celaina Pierce)has been making a documentary film about her friends,whilst she has been stuck at being an assistant to a TV chat-show host,that cant stand her.Suddenly,a sign of hope appears,when a very trendy music TV producer (Michael Grates) crashes into her car!.Due to how genuinely apologetic Michael seems to be (and also due to him being a producer)Ceclaina shows him the documentary that she has been making.Whilst this should be the first step to a clear path to stardom for Celaina,she sadly,has to decide if she wants to enter the "sell-out mainstream" world,or if she should stick to her Gen X friends.Which include her friend Troy,who is trying to figure out what his true feelings are for her... View on the film: For a film that has such a craving to be seen as part of the early to mid nineties alternative scene,it just feels completely artificial and hollow.One of the things that surprised me was,that apart from a handful of some very good tracks,the film completely skips over making any references to the excellent films,music and novels of the era.Whilst all of the strong cast give acceptable performances,they are sadly let down by the terrible screenplay by Helen Childres.Which includes very badly-written sub-story lines for Celainas friends (a storyline involving Janeane "Larry Sanders" Garofalo,waiting for results on being diagnosed with AIDS,is written as such a minor thing,that it should have been cut out at the earliest stages of the screenplay.)The main romance in the film between Celaina and Troy completely crumbles,due to there hardly being any chemistry between them,and also because Troy is a very nasty egotistical bully threw out the whole film. Final view on the film: A strong cast,let down by a very badly written,completely unfunny screenplay.

    This is a film that does not deserve even one star, and although I listed it as such, it really gets zero from me. Simply put, it is the worst film of the 90s. The acting, particularly Hawke and Garafalo, stands out as being lame (Not that I cared about even one character in this film (Which even makes it worse than "Hot Tub Time Machine", who had at least one redeemable character)), and sad to say, the actors operated with a script that no one could possibly salvage. However, what is the worst is how the word "Comedy" pops up in the description of this film. There is not one scene in this film that can be classified as giggle worthy (Let alone funny). It certainly is one of the worst films I have ever saw in my life. The film is brutal, and should be avoided at all costs.

    http:// storiestoriesdk.wordpress.com/2011/08/20/ reality-will-bite-eventually/ Hi everyone , since this movie marked my teenage years in a way and today I got a little nostalgic a text for that in my blog feel free to read it and tell my what you think. It is not really a review it is more how some films affect us even if they aren't the greatest piece of film history, however generation X and this was surely a glamorized version of it feels like the hippies of the 60's compared to what we are experiencing now. And although the cynic in me says that this film is a bunch of clich&eacute;s at times and characters that are more stereotypical filled with songs that are there to manipulate your emotions I have a soft spot for it since it made me feel something that people would usually experience with theirs favorite band and so on

    this movie made me want to have grown up in the 90s! actually, i was 2yrs old when it came out so i didn't watch it until a few days ago. so obviously i don't know it its depiction of that generation is too accurate. But the thing is that even if on the surface it seems different today, the core of their angst remains the same. as a university student and an "adult" i'm supposed to have everything figured out and be in complete touch with who i really am inside. but the truth is that i'm so far from it, it's a miracle i can make any decisions about my future. i know what i want but i don't exactly who i am. weird, right?! so i really don't think its outdated or too old to relate to. also, i read some of the other reviews that criticized the characters; like how much Ryder's character nags, or how cynical or simply lazy hawk's character is, or how slutty and stereotypical Vicky is. i simply disagree; everyone is annoying and has depression periods in their lives when cant find a job after college, when they had all these hopes and dreams when graduating. troy is not lazy and is not too philosophical, he is simply a smart individual who refuses to get submerged by all those corporate society elements around him. and Vicky is just a normal young woman that works hard (becoming manager of the gap) and plays hard (sexual life and AIDS scare). so instead of looking at it in a really superficial manner, the deeper point of view is fascinating. and the implied meanings (fear, dreams, love, existence,...) with many more reasons, are what makes this one of my favorite movies.

    When I have seen career over views being written about Ben Stiller in various magazines and TV programs,they all mention how he first started out in indie films,before he got discovered by a more "mainstream" audience.After having a look at the back cover,and seeing the very impressive cast listings,I was looking forward to an amazing laugh- riot.Instead,I found the film to be shockingly light on laughs of any kind. The plot: A group of Generation X students graduate from college,and realise the it is time that they all enter the real world,and look for a real job.One of them (Celaina Pierce)has been making a documentary film about her friends,whilst she has been stuck at being an assistant to a TV chat-show host,that cant stand her.Suddenly,a sign of hope appears,when a very trendy music TV producer (Michael Grates) crashes into her car!.Due to how genuinely apologetic Michael seems to be (and also due to him being a producer)Ceclaina shows him the documentary that she has been making.Whilst this should be the first step to a clear path to stardom for Celaina,she sadly,has to decide if she wants to enter the "sell-out mainstream" world,or if she should stick to her Gen X friends.Which include her friend Troy,who is trying to figure out what his true feelings are for her... View on the film: For a film that has such a craving to be seen as part of the early to mid nineties alternative scene,it just feels completely artificial and hollow.One of the things that surprised me was,that apart from a handful of some very good tracks,the film completely skips over making any references to the excellent films,music and novels of the era.Whilst all of the strong cast give acceptable performances,they are sadly let down by the terrible screenplay by Helen Childres.Which includes very badly-written sub-story lines for Celainas friends (a storyline involving Janeane "Larry Sanders" Garofalo,waiting for results on being diagnosed with AIDS,is written as such a minor thing,that it should have been cut out at the earliest stages of the screenplay.)The main romance in the film between Celaina and Troy completely crumbles,due to there hardly being any chemistry between them,and also because Troy is a very nasty egotistical bully threw out the whole film. Final view on the film: A strong cast,let down by a very badly written,completely unfunny screenplay.
