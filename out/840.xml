 <sinopse>
  A drifting gunslinger-for-hire finds himself in the middle of an ongoing war between the Irish and Italian mafia in a Prohibition era ghost town.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  John Smith is an amoral gunslinger in the days of Prohibition. On the lam from his latest (unspecified) exploits, he happens upon the town of Jericho, Texas. Actually, calling Jericho a town would be too generous--it has become more like a ghost town, since two warring gangs have 'driven off all the decent folk.' Smith sees this as an opportunity to play both sides off against each other, earning himself a nice piece of change as a hired gun. Despite his strictly avowed mercenary intentions, he finds himself risking his life for his, albeit skewed, sense of honor....

    International filmmakers have exerted great influence on American movies. When Hollywood runs out of fresh ideas, the major studios often turn to foreign films for inspiration. Sometimes, a filmmaker appears who can adapt a foreign film in such a revolutionary way that audiences sits up and pays attention. "Extreme Prejudice" writer & director Walter Hill manages this ambitious feat in his cinematic version of the 1961 Japanese samurai epic "Yojimbo" by the brilliant director Akira Kurosawa. Incidentally, "Yojimbo" translated means "bodyguard." In the 1950s and 1960s, Kurosawa emerged as one of the few Asian filmmakers who commanded the respect of American audiences. His films grew popular in the West. Moreover, Kurosawa translated profitably in westerns. His films have served as the basis for John Sturges' 1960 classic "The Magnificent Seven," Sergio Leone's landmark Spaghetti western "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964), and now Walter Hill's "Last Man Standing." Hill recycles the venerable Kurosawa tale as a Prohibition Era gangster saga, casting Bruce Willis as a tight-lipped soldier of fortune with two automatics and an attitude. The story contains all the subtlety of a hail of lead delivered at point blank range, and "Last Man Standing" erupts with the fury of an artillery barrage. The setting of Jericho, Texas, exists in a moral vacuum. The gangsters have sent all the good people packing and paid for the law as they have bought most of the women. Women decorate the periphery of "Last Man Standing' in minor roles as hostages, whores, and mistresses. These unhappy females are trapped in Jericho as male playthings and the consequences of defiance carry a high price as one girl learns. When John Smith (Bruce Willis of "Die Hard") wheels his Ford into the dusty, remote town of Jericho, he is searching for a quiet place to lay low before he vanishes into Mexico. What he encounters are two greedy Chicago bootlegging clans competing for supremacy over the illegal whiskey trade. Like Clint Eastwood in "A Fistful of Dollars," Smith smells money galore in "Last Man Standing" so he hires out his pistols to the highest bidders. Smith plays the Italians and the Irish skillfully against each other in a suspenseful game of cat and mouse. When he helps a young woman held hostage by the Irish, Smith finally pays for his interference. The Irish gang, headed by Doyle (Daniel Patrick Kelly), captures and stomps our protagonist until he resembles a bruised tomato. Somehow, Smith endures this horrible beating and gets away. Furiously, Doyle massacres the Italian leader, Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg), and his gang at a roadhouse where the Irish believe Smith has filed for protection. Instead, Smith holes up out of town in a church to recover his strength. Jericho's corrupt sheriff (Bruce Dern of "The Cowboys"), decides to help Smith out by loaning him two guns. Smith takes the hardware and challenges the Irish to a Wild West showdown. As his own scenarist, director Walter Hill has kept most of the original story intact. If you're looking for comparisons, you might find it easier to correlate "Last Man Standing" with "A Fistful of Dollars" rather than "Yojimbo." As the writer, Hill fumbles in making the evil, Tommy-gun toting Hickey (Christopher Walken of "The Anderson Tapes") a henchman rather than the boss, as the corresponding character was in "A Fistful of Dollars." He is the only match bullet-for-bullet with Smith. As Hickey, Christopher Walken adds another despicable villain to his cinematic gallery of rogues, playing second fiddle to Doyle. Hill generates minor suspense when lesser characters refer to Hickey's character and the hellishness that always follows in his wake. "Last Man Standing" is a raw, hard-bitten, little, B-move shoot'em-up with A-class pretensions that pays homage to not only Kurosawa but also stylishly imitates the excessive violence from recent Hong Kong crime thrillers. If you want to compare it to one of Bruce's American thrillers, the Tony Scott directed bullet ballet "The Last Boy Scout" (1991) is the best example. Hill the writer doesn't waste time contriving an elaborate plot that hinges on small but crucial details. When characters are not performing tasks on-screen, they are deployed off-screen in plot related activities. This is one who where what the characters do off-screen is of integral importance to what others do on-screen. Compared with Clint Eastwood who played the Man with No Name in "A Fistful of Dollars," Bruce Willis here is the Man With Anybody's Name. As he reveals to the Italians, he is simply John Smith from back East. John Smith is a taciturn fellow. He doesn't make a big deal out of most things unless he finds his expertise challenged. If you're a Willis fan, "Last Man Standing" isn't Bruce as usual. He is neither "Die Hard" Detective John McClane nor is he David Addison from "Moonlighting." He is a man of few words and fewer wisecracks. Smith is an unrepentant hard-case who admits as much without remorse during his opening narration. Here Willis delineates the character of Smith more out of what is left unsaid rather than said. The film amounts to a genre mash-up: a period crime drama crossed with a western. In it, the Old West is a dying dream. The New West, suggests Hill, is being taken over by business suits from back East with hardware. Nevertheless, that Wild West justice might be out of sight but it's not entirely out of mind. Altogether, "Last Man Standing" qualifies as a loud, bloody shoot'em-up that shouldn't disappoint action fans.

    This film doesn't do much wrong except not really doing much right. The mood and feel of a small American western town in Prohibition is nicely put across, borrowing something from films like Eastwood's 'Unforgiven'. The acting is fine, particularly from the always-reliable Christopher Walken who once again lights up more of his role than is asked of him. But the story adaption is a little tired and Willis's "It was a dirty town but all towns were" voice-over feels dated rather than nostalgic. The bad guys are all a bit too thick to seem like adversaries so it feels like any successes of Willis's are inevitable. That makes it hard for the film to keep you wondering as the story appears to just play itself out.

    Last Man Standing is directed by Walter Hill who also adapts the screenplay from a story written by Ry&ucirc;z&ocirc; Kikushima and Akira Kurosawa. It stars Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern, William Sanderson, Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, Karina Lombard and Ned Eisenberg. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern. Walter Hill's variant on Yojimbo, plot basically sees Willis as drifter John Smith, who after arriving in the dusty town of Jericho, promptly sets about making some serious cash by playing the town's two gangs off against each other. Smith is one tough hombre, a deadly pistoleer who has a fear of nothing, which is why the two respective gang leaders want him to work for them. Noses get put out of joint, blood flows, scores settled and a anti-hero is born, complete with permanent scowl and dry narration. The look and sound is terrific, Cooder's pessimistic twangs are all over the plot, while the visuals dovetail between sun-baked landscapes and the misty lensed ghost town of Jericho. Hill brings his trademark stylish violence into play, with slow-mos and rapid fire shoot-outs impressive, while his skill at creating an antique atmosphere is very much in evidence. Unfortunately the narrative isn't up to much, it lacks scope and characters merely exist, making this very much a style over substance exercise. It also means that much of the cast are given only morsels to feed on. A shame when you got Walken and Kelly on overdrive when on screen. It's an odd blend of a Western with Prohibition Noir characters, but it's unmistakably a Walter Hill film. For his fans there's enough to like about it whilst accepting it's a bit of a throwaway on the page. For the casual crime/action film fan, however, it's likely to be much ado about nothing. 7/10

    Walter Hill's dusty non-starter sees sphincter-mouthed shooter Bruce Willis and his bottomless gun clips decimate two rival gangs who have taken over a small town, playing them off against each other while downing shots and whispering a lot. The movie only really throws sparks when Ken 'Kelso' Jenkins pops up with the film's best performance, although there are a few signs of life whenever Christopher Walken appears. But only a few; this is a boring film, slackly paced and slathered in world weary dialogue that's less hard boiled, more over-baked. It comes off as a film that's trying too hard.

    Again another movie that just does not make any sense to me. I personally love action movies. But there has to be at least a minimum amount of story and realism behind the whole thing. There were so many strange inconsistencies in this movie. How can the protagonist enter a room with at least 15 men in it, start shooting around with only 2 pistols, standing in just one place without moving, and not get hit once? Why did they beat up the protagonist, went away and came back minutes later? why not kill him directly? Why was the showdown between hickey and John Smith such a let down? Why did hickey just stand around and let smith shoot without any resistance? Why built up such a super villain just to let him die in such an easy way? Strange movie, strange ending, not a lot of entertainment. I would say a waste of time.

    This movie is a remake of Clint Eastwood's Fistfull of Dollars, which in turn is a remake of Yojimbo. The movie itself is set in the 1920's yet it still has the trademark Western aspects, namely the taming of a savage land. Bruce Willis plays John Smith (which is really a man with no name) who stumbles on a border town in which two gangs fight for control. Upon learning this, Willis decides that it is in his best interest to stay in the town, play each gang up against the other, and then walk out with a lot of money. This is really an action/western style movie. It has its fair share of gunfights, but beyond that it really seems to have little to keep one interested in it. I liked the film though. The gunfights were well executed and there was a few witty remarks scattered across it. The lack of a real cohesive plot comes through the direction of the movie. It is focused on one man who decides to stick his meddling fingers into a dangerous situation. Inevitably everybody catches on to him and puts him through hell, though he manages to deal with them all in the end. The thing about Willis' character is that it has a self-admitted flaw and that is his lust for woman. He seems to be a cold hearted man but he is willing to always kick back with a lovely lady. A number of times he almost meets his end, but inevitably he manages to survive. The dusty, empty town gives it a nice feel to it, and though the movie is overtly long, it is one that Western fans and even those who like action movies should give it a go. It is not the best of movies, but it is good enough to stand on its own.

    One of our most underrated Directors Walter Hill is all over this Movie. His macho style and swagger is forefront and the stylist is on his game with violence and hard edged beauty. It is Neo-Noir for sure as our Anti-Hero enters a one (dead) horse town on the border, his voice-over narration ("then I saw her and the fun started") tells us we are back with Hammett and Chandler. This one starts off with action and only lets up occasionally to fill in the dusty plot of females in distress and prohibition Gang rivalry. This one, as are most of Hill's Films, is overlooked and under-appreciated. It is a slam bang salutation to Akira Kurosawa and Sergio Leone. A great cast are all in on the fun and this delivers everything in the tradition.

    an amoral gunslinger in the days of Prohibition, on the run from his latest exploits, happens upon the town of Jericho, Texas. It has become more like a ghost town, since two warring gangs have driven off all the decent folk. Smith sees an opportunity to play both sides off against each other, earning himself a nice piece of change as a hired gun. Despite his strictly avowed mercenary intentions, he finds himself risking his life for his, albeit skewed, sense of honour.... Made at a time when Willis was struggling to make it big at the box office, it comes as no surprise that this disappeared pretty rapidly at the cinema. But it's still a solid action movie, which is slightly tarnished as a remake of a remake and so on. Willis is great as always as John, the gunslinger who is playing off each gang. Hill directs the action pieces with expertise, and it's a lovely move having Walken appear int he second act, all the time before with his gang mentioning him in passing. Why this cost so much to make, I have no idea, because the production values are not the best, but it has an eclectic cast, who really know how the liven up an average script. There are plot holes aplenty, but it's a swift movie, with hardly any pauses, and it's one of Willis' hidden gems. See it as a throwaway action movie, and you'll enjoy it

    The movie tells the story of a loner going to Jericho, Texas which is a border town near Mexico and gets mixed up with two rival booze gangs during prohibition. Bruce plays the main character named John Smith which is basically a way of calling him a Name with No Name like Clint Eastwood's character was in the Dollars Trilogy. Smith plays the two gangs against each other leveraging them from more money until things get out of hand and eventually he has to choose between the two. The movie has a really good cast with Bruce Dern, Leslie Mann, Christopher Walken, Michael Imperioli amongst others. The movie is basically a remake of the Kurosawa film Yojimbo and while it doesn't quite equal the heights of that it's a solid film but not great.

    Last Man Standing is directed by Walter Hill who also adapts the screenplay from a story written by Ry&ucirc;z&ocirc; Kikushima and Akira Kurosawa. It stars Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern, William Sanderson, Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, Karina Lombard and Ned Eisenberg. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern. Walter Hill's variant on Yojimbo, plot basically sees Willis as drifter John Smith, who after arriving in the dusty town of Jericho, promptly sets about making some serious cash by playing the town's two gangs off against each other. Smith is one tough hombre, a deadly pistoleer who has a fear of nothing, which is why the two respective gang leaders want him to work for them. Noses get put out of joint, blood flows, scores settled and a anti-hero is born, complete with permanent scowl and dry narration. The look and sound is terrific, Cooder's pessimistic twangs are all over the plot, while the visuals dovetail between sun-baked landscapes and the misty lensed ghost town of Jericho. Hill brings his trademark stylish violence into play, with slow-mos and rapid fire shoot-outs impressive, while his skill at creating an antique atmosphere is very much in evidence. Unfortunately the narrative isn't up to much, it lacks scope and characters merely exist, making this very much a style over substance exercise.

The movie itself is set in the 1920's yet it still has the trademark Western aspects, namely the taming of a savage land. Bruce Willis plays John Smith (which is really a man with no name) who stumbles on a border town in which two gangs fight for control. Upon learning this, Willis decides that it is in his best interest to stay in the town, play each gang up against the other, and then walk out with a lot of money. This is really an action/western style movie. It has its fair share of gunfights, but beyond that it really seems to have little to keep one interested in it. I liked the film though. The gunfights were well executed and there was a few witty remarks scattered across it. The lack of a real cohesive plot comes through the direction of the movie. It is focused on one man who decides to stick his meddling fingers into a dangerous situation. Inevitably everybody catches on to him and puts him through hell, though he manages to deal with them all in the end. The thing about Willis' character is that it has a self-admitted flaw and that is his lust for woman. He seems to be a cold hearted man but he is willing to always kick back with a lovely lady. A number of times he almost meets his end, but inevitably he manages to survive. The dusty, empty town gives it a nice feel to it, and though the movie is overtly long, it is one that Western fans and even those who like action movies should give it a go. It is not the best of movies, but it is good enough to stand on its own.

    One of our most underrated Directors Walter Hill is all over this Movie. His macho style and swagger is forefront and the stylist is on his game with violence and hard edged beauty. It is Neo-Noir for sure as our Anti-Hero enters a one (dead) horse town on the border, his voice-over narration ("then I saw her and the fun started") tells us we are back with Hammett and Chandler. This one starts off with action and only lets up occasionally to fill in the dusty plot of females in distress and prohibition Gang rivalry. This one, as are most of Hill's Films, is overlooked and under-appreciated. It is a slam bang salutation to Akira Kurosawa and Sergio Leone. A great cast are all in on the fun and this delivers everything in the tradition.

    an amoral gunslinger in the days of Prohibition, on the run from his latest exploits, happens upon the town of Jericho, Texas. It has become more like a ghost town, since two warring gangs have driven off all the decent folk. Smith sees an opportunity to play both sides off against each other, earning himself a nice piece of change as a hired gun. Despite his strictly avowed mercenary intentions, he finds himself risking his life for his, albeit skewed, sense of honour.... Made at a time when Willis was struggling to make it big at the box office, it comes as no surprise that this disappeared pretty rapidly at the cinema. But it's still a solid action movie, which is slightly tarnished as a remake of a remake and so on. Willis is great as always as John, the gunslinger who is playing off each gang. Hill directs the action pieces with expertise, and it's a lovely move having Walken appear int he second act, all the time before with his gang mentioning him in passing. Why this cost so much to make, I have no idea, because the production values are not the best, but it has an eclectic cast, who really know how the liven up an average script. There are plot holes aplenty, but it's a swift movie, with hardly any pauses, and it's one of Willis' hidden gems. See it as a throwaway action movie, and you'll enjoy it

    The movie tells the story of a loner going to Jericho, Texas which is a border town near Mexico and gets mixed up with two rival booze gangs during prohibition. Bruce plays the main character named John Smith which is basically a way of calling him a Name with No Name like Clint Eastwood's character was in the Dollars Trilogy. Smith plays the two gangs against each other leveraging them from more money until things get out of hand and eventually he has to choose between the two. The movie has a really good cast with Bruce Dern, Leslie Mann, Christopher Walken, Michael Imperioli amongst others. The movie is basically a remake of the Kurosawa film Yojimbo and while it doesn't quite equal the heights of that it's a solid film but not great.

    International filmmakers have exerted great influence on American movies. When Hollywood runs out of fresh ideas, the major studios often turn to foreign films for inspiration. Sometimes, a filmmaker appears who can adapt a foreign film in such a revolutionary way that audiences sits up and pays attention. "Extreme Prejudice" writer & director Walter Hill manages this ambitious feat in his cinematic version of the 1961 Japanese samurai epic "Yojimbo" by the brilliant director Akira Kurosawa. Incidentally, "Yojimbo" translated means "bodyguard." In the 1950s and 1960s, Kurosawa emerged as one of the few Asian filmmakers who commanded the respect of American audiences. His films grew popular in the West. Moreover, Kurosawa translated profitably in westerns. His films have served as the basis for John Sturges' 1960 classic "The Magnificent Seven," Sergio Leone's landmark Spaghetti western "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964), and now Walter Hill's "Last Man Standing." Hill recycles the venerable Kurosawa tale as a Prohibition Era gangster saga, casting Bruce Willis as a tight-lipped soldier of fortune with two automatics and an attitude. The story contains all the subtlety of a hail of lead delivered at point blank range, and "Last Man Standing" erupts with the fury of an artillery barrage. The setting of Jericho, Texas, exists in a moral vacuum. The gangsters have sent all the good people packing and paid for the law as they have bought most of the women. Women decorate the periphery of "Last Man Standing' in minor roles as hostages, whores, and mistresses. These unhappy females are trapped in Jericho as male playthings and the consequences of defiance carry a high price as one girl learns. When John Smith (Bruce Willis of "Die Hard") wheels his Ford into the dusty, remote town of Jericho, he is searching for a quiet place to lay low before he vanishes into Mexico. What he encounters are two greedy Chicago bootlegging clans competing for supremacy over the illegal whiskey trade. Like Clint Eastwood in "A Fistful of Dollars," Smith smells money galore in "Last Man Standing" so he hires out his pistols to the highest bidders. Smith plays the Italians and the Irish skillfully against each other in a suspenseful game of cat and mouse. When he helps a young woman held hostage by the Irish, Smith finally pays for his interference. The Irish gang, headed by Doyle (Daniel Patrick Kelly), captures and stomps our protagonist until he resembles a bruised tomato. Somehow, Smith endures this horrible beating and gets away. Furiously, Doyle massacres the Italian leader, Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg), and his gang at a roadhouse where the Irish believe Smith has filed for protection. Instead, Smith holes up out of town in a church to recover his strength. Jericho's corrupt sheriff (Bruce Dern of "The Cowboys"), decides to help Smith out by loaning him two guns. Smith takes the hardware and challenges the Irish to a Wild West showdown. As his own scenarist, director Walter Hill has kept most of the original story intact. If you're looking for comparisons, you might find it easier to correlate "Last Man Standing" with "A Fistful of Dollars" rather than "Yojimbo." As the writer, Hill fumbles in making the evil, Tommy-gun toting Hickey (Christopher Walken of "The Anderson Tapes") a henchman rather than the boss, as the corresponding character was in "A Fistful of Dollars." He is the only match bullet-for-bullet with Smith. As Hickey, Christopher Walken adds another despicable villain to his cinematic gallery of rogues, playing second fiddle to Doyle. Hill generates minor suspense when lesser characters refer to Hickey's character and the hellishness that always follows in his wake. "Last Man Standing" is a raw, hard-bitten, little, B-move shoot'em-up with A-class pretensions that pays homage to not only Kurosawa but also stylishly imitates the excessive violence from recent Hong Kong crime thrillers. If you want to compare it to one of Bruce's American thrillers, the Tony Scott directed bullet ballet "The Last Boy Scout" (1991) is the best example. Hill the writer doesn't waste time contriving an elaborate plot that hinges on small but crucial details. When characters are not performing tasks on-screen, they are deployed off-screen in plot related activities. This is one who where what the characters do off-screen is of integral importance to what others do on-screen. Compared with Clint Eastwood who played the Man with No Name in "A Fistful of Dollars," Bruce Willis here is the Man With Anybody's Name. As he reveals to the Italians, he is simply John Smith from back East. John Smith is a taciturn fellow. He doesn't make a big deal out of most things unless he finds his expertise challenged. If you're a Willis fan, "Last Man Standing" isn't Bruce as usual. He is neither "Die Hard" Detective John McClane nor is he David Addison from "Moonlighting." He is a man of few words and fewer wisecracks. Smith is an unrepentant hard-case who admits as much without remorse during his opening narration. Here Willis delineates the character of Smith more out of what is left unsaid rather than said. The film amounts to a genre mash-up: a period crime drama crossed with a western. In it, the Old West is a dying dream. The New West, suggests Hill, is being taken over by business suits from back East with hardware. Nevertheless, that Wild West justice might be out of sight but it's not entirely out of mind. Altogether, "Last Man Standing" qualifies as a loud, bloody shoot'em-up that shouldn't disappoint action fans.

    This film doesn't do much wrong except not really doing much right. The mood and feel of a small American western town in Prohibition is nicely put across, borrowing something from films like Eastwood's 'Unforgiven'. The acting is fine, particularly from the always-reliable Christopher Walken who once again lights up more of his role than is asked of him. But the story adaption is a little tired and Willis's "It was a dirty town but all towns were" voice-over feels dated rather than nostalgic. The bad guys are all a bit too thick to seem like adversaries so it feels like any successes of Willis's are inevitable. That makes it hard for the film to keep you wondering as the story appears to just play itself out.

    Last Man Standing is directed by Walter Hill who also adapts the screenplay from a story written by Ry&ucirc;z&ocirc; Kikushima and Akira Kurosawa. It stars Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern, William Sanderson, Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, Karina Lombard and Ned Eisenberg. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern. Walter Hill's variant on Yojimbo, plot basically sees Willis as drifter John Smith, who after arriving in the dusty town of Jericho, promptly sets about making some serious cash by playing the town's two gangs off against each other. Smith is one tough hombre, a deadly pistoleer who has a fear of nothing, which is why the two respective gang leaders want him to work for them. Noses get put out of joint, blood flows, scores settled and a anti-hero is born, complete with permanent scowl and dry narration. The look and sound is terrific, Cooder's pessimistic twangs are all over the plot, while the visuals dovetail between sun-baked landscapes and the misty lensed ghost town of Jericho. Hill brings his trademark stylish violence into play, with slow-mos and rapid fire shoot-outs impressive, while his skill at creating an antique atmosphere is very much in evidence. Unfortunately the narrative isn't up to much, it lacks scope and characters merely exist, making this very much a style over substance exercise. It also means that much of the cast are given only morsels to feed on. A shame when you got Walken and Kelly on overdrive when on screen. It's an odd blend of a Western with Prohibition Noir characters, but it's unmistakably a Walter Hill film. For his fans there's enough to like about it whilst accepting it's a bit of a throwaway on the page. For the casual crime/action film fan, however, it's likely to be much ado about nothing. 7/10

    Walter Hill's dusty non-starter sees sphincter-mouthed shooter Bruce Willis and his bottomless gun clips decimate two rival gangs who have taken over a small town, playing them off against each other while downing shots and whispering a lot. The movie only really throws sparks when Ken 'Kelso' Jenkins pops up with the film's best performance, although there are a few signs of life whenever Christopher Walken appears. But only a few; this is a boring film, slackly paced and slathered in world weary dialogue that's less hard boiled, more over-baked. It comes off as a film that's trying too hard.

    This is strikingly visual. Even if you mute the audio (which I don't recommend), it is amazing to view. Notice the lighting especially. Close ups and wide outdoor scenes have a special quality that are sure to satisfy your visual experience. Thank you for this visual spectacular. Normally I hate films with a a narrator (show me, don't tell me!), but this film's lighting and framing captured me. I hope other directors, artistic directors, and editors learn from this film and know that the audience can be immersed in the visual spectacle. Even if you hate the script (I didn't, I liked it), _watch_ it and be amazed.

    Again another movie that just does not make any sense to me. I personally love action movies. But there has to be at least a minimum amount of story and realism behind the whole thing. There were so many strange inconsistencies in this movie. How can the protagonist enter a room with at least 15 men in it, start shooting around with only 2 pistols, standing in just one place without moving, and not get hit once? Why did they beat up the protagonist, went away and came back minutes later? why not kill him directly? Why was the showdown between hickey and John Smith such a let down? Why did hickey just stand around and let smith shoot without any resistance? Why built up such a super villain just to let him die in such an easy way? Strange movie, strange ending, not a lot of entertainment. I would say a waste of time.

    This movie is a remake of Clint Eastwood's Fistfull of Dollars, which in turn is a remake of Yojimbo. The movie itself is set in the 1920's yet it still has the trademark Western aspects, namely the taming of a savage land. Bruce Willis plays John Smith (which is really a man with no name) who stumbles on a border town in which two gangs fight for control. Upon learning this, Willis decides that it is in his best interest to stay in the town, play each gang up against the other, and then walk out with a lot of money. This is really an action/western style movie. It has its fair share of gunfights, but beyond that it really seems to have little to keep one interested in it. I liked the film though. The gunfights were well executed and there was a few witty remarks scattered across it. The lack of a real cohesive plot comes through the direction of the movie. It is focused on one man who decides to stick his meddling fingers into a dangerous situation. Inevitably everybody catches on to him and puts him through hell, though he manages to deal with them all in the end. The thing about Willis' character is that it has a self-admitted flaw and that is his lust for woman. He seems to be a cold hearted man but he is willing to always kick back with a lovely lady. A number of times he almost meets his end, but inevitably he manages to survive. The dusty, empty town gives it a nice feel to it, and though the movie is overtly long, it is one that Western fans and even those who like action movies should give it a go.

It is Neo-Noir for sure as our Anti-Hero enters a one (dead) horse town on the border, his voice-over narration ("then I saw her and the fun started") tells us we are back with Hammett and Chandler. This one starts off with action and only lets up occasionally to fill in the dusty plot of females in distress and prohibition Gang rivalry. This one, as are most of Hill's Films, is overlooked and under-appreciated. It is a slam bang salutation to Akira Kurosawa and Sergio Leone. A great cast are all in on the fun and this delivers everything in the tradition.

    Walter Hill's dusty non-starter sees sphincter-mouthed shooter Bruce Willis and his bottomless gun clips decimate two rival gangs who have taken over a small town, playing them off against each other while downing shots and whispering a lot. The movie only really throws sparks when Ken 'Kelso' Jenkins pops up with the film's best performance, although there are a few signs of life whenever Christopher Walken appears. But only a few; this is a boring film, slackly paced and slathered in world weary dialogue that's less hard boiled, more over-baked. It comes off as a film that's trying too hard.

    This is strikingly visual. Even if you mute the audio (which I don't recommend), it is amazing to view. Notice the lighting especially. Close ups and wide outdoor scenes have a special quality that are sure to satisfy your visual experience. Thank you for this visual spectacular. Normally I hate films with a a narrator (show me, don't tell me!), but this film's lighting and framing captured me. I hope other directors, artistic directors, and editors learn from this film and know that the audience can be immersed in the visual spectacle. Even if you hate the script (I didn't, I liked it), _watch_ it and be amazed.

    Again another movie that just does not make any sense to me. I personally love action movies. But there has to be at least a minimum amount of story and realism behind the whole thing. There were so many strange inconsistencies in this movie. How can the protagonist enter a room with at least 15 men in it, start shooting around with only 2 pistols, standing in just one place without moving, and not get hit once? Why did they beat up the protagonist, went away and came back minutes later? why not kill him directly? Why was the showdown between hickey and John Smith such a let down? Why did hickey just stand around and let smith shoot without any resistance? Why built up such a super villain just to let him die in such an easy way? Strange movie, strange ending, not a lot of entertainment. I would say a waste of time.

    This movie is a remake of Clint Eastwood's Fistfull of Dollars, which in turn is a remake of Yojimbo. The movie itself is set in the 1920's yet it still has the trademark Western aspects, namely the taming of a savage land. Bruce Willis plays John Smith (which is really a man with no name) who stumbles on a border town in which two gangs fight for control. Upon learning this, Willis decides that it is in his best interest to stay in the town, play each gang up against the other, and then walk out with a lot of money. This is really an action/western style movie. It has its fair share of gunfights, but beyond that it really seems to have little to keep one interested in it. I liked the film though. The gunfights were well executed and there was a few witty remarks scattered across it. The lack of a real cohesive plot comes through the direction of the movie. It is focused on one man who decides to stick his meddling fingers into a dangerous situation. Inevitably everybody catches on to him and puts him through hell, though he manages to deal with them all in the end. The thing about Willis' character is that it has a self-admitted flaw and that is his lust for woman. He seems to be a cold hearted man but he is willing to always kick back with a lovely lady. A number of times he almost meets his end, but inevitably he manages to survive. The dusty, empty town gives it a nice feel to it, and though the movie is overtly long, it is one that Western fans and even those who like action movies should give it a go. It is not the best of movies, but it is good enough to stand on its own.

    One of our most underrated Directors Walter Hill is all over this Movie. His macho style and swagger is forefront and the stylist is on his game with violence and hard edged beauty. It is Neo-Noir for sure as our Anti-Hero enters a one (dead) horse town on the border, his voice-over narration ("then I saw her and the fun started") tells us we are back with Hammett and Chandler. This one starts off with action and only lets up occasionally to fill in the dusty plot of females in distress and prohibition Gang rivalry. This one, as are most of Hill's Films, is overlooked and under-appreciated. It is a slam bang salutation to Akira Kurosawa and Sergio Leone. A great cast are all in on the fun and this delivers everything in the tradition.

    an amoral gunslinger in the days of Prohibition, on the run from his latest exploits, happens upon the town of Jericho, Texas. It has become more like a ghost town, since two warring gangs have driven off all the decent folk. Smith sees an opportunity to play both sides off against each other, earning himself a nice piece of change as a hired gun. Despite his strictly avowed mercenary intentions, he finds himself risking his life for his, albeit skewed, sense of honour.... Made at a time when Willis was struggling to make it big at the box office, it comes as no surprise that this disappeared pretty rapidly at the cinema. But it's still a solid action movie, which is slightly tarnished as a remake of a remake and so on. Willis is great as always as John, the gunslinger who is playing off each gang. Hill directs the action pieces with expertise, and it's a lovely move having Walken appear int he second act, all the time before with his gang mentioning him in passing. Why this cost so much to make, I have no idea, because the production values are not the best, but it has an eclectic cast, who really know how the liven up an average script. There are plot holes aplenty, but it's a swift movie, with hardly any pauses, and it's one of Willis' hidden gems. See it as a throwaway action movie, and you'll enjoy it

    The movie tells the story of a loner going to Jericho, Texas which is a border town near Mexico and gets mixed up with two rival booze gangs during prohibition. Bruce plays the main character named John Smith which is basically a way of calling him a Name with No Name like Clint Eastwood's character was in the Dollars Trilogy. Smith plays the two gangs against each other leveraging them from more money until things get out of hand and eventually he has to choose between the two. The movie has a really good cast with Bruce Dern, Leslie Mann, Christopher Walken, Michael Imperioli amongst others. The movie is basically a remake of the Kurosawa film Yojimbo and while it doesn't quite equal the heights of that it's a solid film but not great.

    International filmmakers have exerted great influence on American movies. When Hollywood runs out of fresh ideas, the major studios often turn to foreign films for inspiration. Sometimes, a filmmaker appears who can adapt a foreign film in such a revolutionary way that audiences sits up and pays attention. "Extreme Prejudice" writer & director Walter Hill manages this ambitious feat in his cinematic version of the 1961 Japanese samurai epic "Yojimbo" by the brilliant director Akira Kurosawa. Incidentally, "Yojimbo" translated means "bodyguard." In the 1950s and 1960s, Kurosawa emerged as one of the few Asian filmmakers who commanded the respect of American audiences. His films grew popular in the West. Moreover, Kurosawa translated profitably in westerns. His films have served as the basis for John Sturges' 1960 classic "The Magnificent Seven," Sergio Leone's landmark Spaghetti western "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964), and now Walter Hill's "Last Man Standing." Hill recycles the venerable Kurosawa tale as a Prohibition Era gangster saga, casting Bruce Willis as a tight-lipped soldier of fortune with two automatics and an attitude. The story contains all the subtlety of a hail of lead delivered at point blank range, and "Last Man Standing" erupts with the fury of an artillery barrage. The setting of Jericho, Texas, exists in a moral vacuum. The gangsters have sent all the good people packing and paid for the law as they have bought most of the women. Women decorate the periphery of "Last Man Standing' in minor roles as hostages, whores, and mistresses. These unhappy females are trapped in Jericho as male playthings and the consequences of defiance carry a high price as one girl learns. When John Smith (Bruce Willis of "Die Hard") wheels his Ford into the dusty, remote town of Jericho, he is searching for a quiet place to lay low before he vanishes into Mexico. What he encounters are two greedy Chicago bootlegging clans competing for supremacy over the illegal whiskey trade. Like Clint Eastwood in "A Fistful of Dollars," Smith smells money galore in "Last Man Standing" so he hires out his pistols to the highest bidders. Smith plays the Italians and the Irish skillfully against each other in a suspenseful game of cat and mouse. When he helps a young woman held hostage by the Irish, Smith finally pays for his interference. The Irish gang, headed by Doyle (Daniel Patrick Kelly), captures and stomps our protagonist until he resembles a bruised tomato. Somehow, Smith endures this horrible beating and gets away. Furiously, Doyle massacres the Italian leader, Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg), and his gang at a roadhouse where the Irish believe Smith has filed for protection. Instead, Smith holes up out of town in a church to recover his strength. Jericho's corrupt sheriff (Bruce Dern of "The Cowboys"), decides to help Smith out by loaning him two guns. Smith takes the hardware and challenges the Irish to a Wild West showdown. As his own scenarist, director Walter Hill has kept most of the original story intact. If you're looking for comparisons, you might find it easier to correlate "Last Man Standing" with "A Fistful of Dollars" rather than "Yojimbo." As the writer, Hill fumbles in making the evil, Tommy-gun toting Hickey (Christopher Walken of "The Anderson Tapes") a henchman rather than the boss, as the corresponding character was in "A Fistful of Dollars." He is the only match bullet-for-bullet with Smith. As Hickey, Christopher Walken adds another despicable villain to his cinematic gallery of rogues, playing second fiddle to Doyle. Hill generates minor suspense when lesser characters refer to Hickey's character and the hellishness that always follows in his wake. "Last Man Standing" is a raw, hard-bitten, little, B-move shoot'em-up with A-class pretensions that pays homage to not only Kurosawa but also stylishly imitates the excessive violence from recent Hong Kong crime thrillers. If you want to compare it to one of Bruce's American thrillers, the Tony Scott directed bullet ballet "The Last Boy Scout" (1991) is the best example. Hill the writer doesn't waste time contriving an elaborate plot that hinges on small but crucial details. When characters are not performing tasks on-screen, they are deployed off-screen in plot related activities. This is one who where what the characters do off-screen is of integral importance to what others do on-screen. Compared with Clint Eastwood who played the Man with No Name in "A Fistful of Dollars," Bruce Willis here is the Man With Anybody's Name. As he reveals to the Italians, he is simply John Smith from back East. John Smith is a taciturn fellow. He doesn't make a big deal out of most things unless he finds his expertise challenged. If you're a Willis fan, "Last Man Standing" isn't Bruce as usual. He is neither "Die Hard" Detective John McClane nor is he David Addison from "Moonlighting." He is a man of few words and fewer wisecracks. Smith is an unrepentant hard-case who admits as much without remorse during his opening narration. Here Willis delineates the character of Smith more out of what is left unsaid rather than said. The film amounts to a genre mash-up: a period crime drama crossed with a western. In it, the Old West is a dying dream. The New West, suggests Hill, is being taken over by business suits from back East with hardware. Nevertheless, that Wild West justice might be out of sight but it's not entirely out of mind. Altogether, "Last Man Standing" qualifies as a loud, bloody shoot'em-up that shouldn't disappoint action fans.

    This film doesn't do much wrong except not really doing much right. The mood and feel of a small American western town in Prohibition is nicely put across, borrowing something from films like Eastwood's 'Unforgiven'. The acting is fine, particularly from the always-reliable Christopher Walken who once again lights up more of his role than is asked of him. But the story adaption is a little tired and Willis's "It was a dirty town but all towns were" voice-over feels dated rather than nostalgic. The bad guys are all a bit too thick to seem like adversaries so it feels like any successes of Willis's are inevitable. That makes it hard for the film to keep you wondering as the story appears to just play itself out.

    Last Man Standing is directed by Walter Hill who also adapts the screenplay from a story written by Ry&ucirc;z&ocirc; Kikushima and Akira Kurosawa. It stars Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern, William Sanderson, Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, Karina Lombard and Ned Eisenberg. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern. Walter Hill's variant on Yojimbo, plot basically sees Willis as drifter John Smith, who after arriving in the dusty town of Jericho, promptly sets about making some serious cash by playing the town's two gangs off against each other. Smith is one tough hombre, a deadly pistoleer who has a fear of nothing, which is why the two respective gang leaders want him to work for them. Noses get put out of joint, blood flows, scores settled and a anti-hero is born, complete with permanent scowl and dry narration. The look and sound is terrific, Cooder's pessimistic twangs are all over the plot, while the visuals dovetail between sun-baked landscapes and the misty lensed ghost town of Jericho. Hill brings his trademark stylish violence into play, with slow-mos and rapid fire shoot-outs impressive, while his skill at creating an antique atmosphere is very much in evidence. Unfortunately the narrative isn't up to much, it lacks scope and characters merely exist, making this very much a style over substance exercise. It also means that much of the cast are given only morsels to feed on. A shame when you got Walken and Kelly on overdrive when on screen. It's an odd blend of a Western with Prohibition Noir characters, but it's unmistakably a Walter Hill film. For his fans there's enough to like about it whilst accepting it's a bit of a throwaway on the page. For the casual crime/action film fan, however, it's likely to be much ado about nothing. 7/10

    Walter Hill's dusty non-starter sees sphincter-mouthed shooter Bruce Willis and his bottomless gun clips decimate two rival gangs who have taken over a small town, playing them off against each other while downing shots and whispering a lot. The movie only really throws sparks when Ken 'Kelso' Jenkins pops up with the film's best performance, although there are a few signs of life whenever Christopher Walken appears. But only a few; this is a boring film, slackly paced and slathered in world weary dialogue that's less hard boiled, more over-baked. It comes off as a film that's trying too hard.

Nevertheless, that Wild West justice might be out of sight but it's not entirely out of mind. Altogether, "Last Man Standing" qualifies as a loud, bloody shoot'em-up that shouldn't disappoint action fans.

But the story adaption is a little tired and Willis's "It was a dirty town but all towns were" voice-over feels dated rather than nostalgic. The bad guys are all a bit too thick to seem like adversaries so it feels like any successes of Willis's are inevitable. That makes it hard for the film to keep you wondering as the story appears to just play itself out.

    Last Man Standing is directed by Walter Hill who also adapts the screenplay from a story written by Ry&ucirc;z&ocirc; Kikushima and Akira Kurosawa. It stars Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern, William Sanderson, Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, Karina Lombard and Ned Eisenberg. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern. Walter Hill's variant on Yojimbo, plot basically sees Willis as drifter John Smith, who after arriving in the dusty town of Jericho, promptly sets about making some serious cash by playing the town's two gangs off against each other. Smith is one tough hombre, a deadly pistoleer who has a fear of nothing, which is why the two respective gang leaders want him to work for them. Noses get put out of joint, blood flows, scores settled and a anti-hero is born, complete with permanent scowl and dry narration. The look and sound is terrific, Cooder's pessimistic twangs are all over the plot, while the visuals dovetail between sun-baked landscapes and the misty lensed ghost town of Jericho. Hill brings his trademark stylish violence into play, with slow-mos and rapid fire shoot-outs impressive, while his skill at creating an antique atmosphere is very much in evidence. Unfortunately the narrative isn't up to much, it lacks scope and characters merely exist, making this very much a style over substance exercise. It also means that much of the cast are given only morsels to feed on. A shame when you got Walken and Kelly on overdrive when on screen. It's an odd blend of a Western with Prohibition Noir characters, but it's unmistakably a Walter Hill film. For his fans there's enough to like about it whilst accepting it's a bit of a throwaway on the page. For the casual crime/action film fan, however, it's likely to be much ado about nothing. 7/10

    Walter Hill's dusty non-starter sees sphincter-mouthed shooter Bruce Willis and his bottomless gun clips decimate two rival gangs who have taken over a small town, playing them off against each other while downing shots and whispering a lot. The movie only really throws sparks when Ken 'Kelso' Jenkins pops up with the film's best performance, although there are a few signs of life whenever Christopher Walken appears. But only a few; this is a boring film, slackly paced and slathered in world weary dialogue that's less hard boiled, more over-baked. It comes off as a film that's trying too hard.

    This is strikingly visual. Even if you mute the audio (which I don't recommend), it is amazing to view. Notice the lighting especially. Close ups and wide outdoor scenes have a special quality that are sure to satisfy your visual experience. Thank you for this visual spectacular. Normally I hate films with a a narrator (show me, don't tell me!), but this film's lighting and framing captured me. I hope other directors, artistic directors, and editors learn from this film and know that the audience can be immersed in the visual spectacle. Even if you hate the script (I didn't, I liked it), _watch_ it and be amazed.

    Again another movie that just does not make any sense to me. I personally love action movies. But there has to be at least a minimum amount of story and realism behind the whole thing. There were so many strange inconsistencies in this movie. How can the protagonist enter a room with at least 15 men in it, start shooting around with only 2 pistols, standing in just one place without moving, and not get hit once? Why did they beat up the protagonist, went away and came back minutes later? why not kill him directly? Why was the showdown between hickey and John Smith such a let down? Why did hickey just stand around and let smith shoot without any resistance? Why built up such a super villain just to let him die in such an easy way? Strange movie, strange ending, not a lot of entertainment. I would say a waste of time.

    This movie is a remake of Clint Eastwood's Fistfull of Dollars, which in turn is a remake of Yojimbo. The movie itself is set in the 1920's yet it still has the trademark Western aspects, namely the taming of a savage land. Bruce Willis plays John Smith (which is really a man with no name) who stumbles on a border town in which two gangs fight for control. Upon learning this, Willis decides that it is in his best interest to stay in the town, play each gang up against the other, and then walk out with a lot of money. This is really an action/western style movie. It has its fair share of gunfights, but beyond that it really seems to have little to keep one interested in it. I liked the film though. The gunfights were well executed and there was a few witty remarks scattered across it. The lack of a real cohesive plot comes through the direction of the movie. It is focused on one man who decides to stick his meddling fingers into a dangerous situation. Inevitably everybody catches on to him and puts him through hell, though he manages to deal with them all in the end. The thing about Willis' character is that it has a self-admitted flaw and that is his lust for woman. He seems to be a cold hearted man but he is willing to always kick back with a lovely lady. A number of times he almost meets his end, but inevitably he manages to survive. The dusty, empty town gives it a nice feel to it, and though the movie is overtly long, it is one that Western fans and even those who like action movies should give it a go. It is not the best of movies, but it is good enough to stand on its own.

    One of our most underrated Directors Walter Hill is all over this Movie. His macho style and swagger is forefront and the stylist is on his game with violence and hard edged beauty. It is Neo-Noir for sure as our Anti-Hero enters a one (dead) horse town on the border, his voice-over narration ("then I saw her and the fun started") tells us we are back with Hammett and Chandler. This one starts off with action and only lets up occasionally to fill in the dusty plot of females in distress and prohibition Gang rivalry. This one, as are most of Hill's Films, is overlooked and under-appreciated. It is a slam bang salutation to Akira Kurosawa and Sergio Leone. A great cast are all in on the fun and this delivers everything in the tradition.

    an amoral gunslinger in the days of Prohibition, on the run from his latest exploits, happens upon the town of Jericho, Texas. It has become more like a ghost town, since two warring gangs have driven off all the decent folk. Smith sees an opportunity to play both sides off against each other, earning himself a nice piece of change as a hired gun. Despite his strictly avowed mercenary intentions, he finds himself risking his life for his, albeit skewed, sense of honour.... Made at a time when Willis was struggling to make it big at the box office, it comes as no surprise that this disappeared pretty rapidly at the cinema. But it's still a solid action movie, which is slightly tarnished as a remake of a remake and so on. Willis is great as always as John, the gunslinger who is playing off each gang. Hill directs the action pieces with expertise, and it's a lovely move having Walken appear int he second act, all the time before with his gang mentioning him in passing. Why this cost so much to make, I have no idea, because the production values are not the best, but it has an eclectic cast, who really know how the liven up an average script. There are plot holes aplenty, but it's a swift movie, with hardly any pauses, and it's one of Willis' hidden gems. See it as a throwaway action movie, and you'll enjoy it

    The movie tells the story of a loner going to Jericho, Texas which is a border town near Mexico and gets mixed up with two rival booze gangs during prohibition. Bruce plays the main character named John Smith which is basically a way of calling him a Name with No Name like Clint Eastwood's character was in the Dollars Trilogy. Smith plays the two gangs against each other leveraging them from more money until things get out of hand and eventually he has to choose between the two. The movie has a really good cast with Bruce Dern, Leslie Mann, Christopher Walken, Michael Imperioli amongst others. The movie is basically a remake of the Kurosawa film Yojimbo and while it doesn't quite equal the heights of that it's a solid film but not great.

    International filmmakers have exerted great influence on American movies. When Hollywood runs out of fresh ideas, the major studios often turn to foreign films for inspiration. Sometimes, a filmmaker appears who can adapt a foreign film in such a revolutionary way that audiences sits up and pays attention. "Extreme Prejudice" writer & director Walter Hill manages this ambitious feat in his cinematic version of the 1961 Japanese samurai epic "Yojimbo" by the brilliant director Akira Kurosawa. Incidentally, "Yojimbo" translated means "bodyguard." In the 1950s and 1960s, Kurosawa emerged as one of the few Asian filmmakers who commanded the respect of American audiences. His films grew popular in the West. Moreover, Kurosawa translated profitably in westerns. His films have served as the basis for John Sturges' 1960 classic "The Magnificent Seven," Sergio Leone's landmark Spaghetti western "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964), and now Walter Hill's "Last Man Standing." Hill recycles the venerable Kurosawa tale as a Prohibition Era gangster saga, casting Bruce Willis as a tight-lipped soldier of fortune with two automatics and an attitude. The story contains all the subtlety of a hail of lead delivered at point blank range, and "Last Man Standing" erupts with the fury of an artillery barrage. The setting of Jericho, Texas, exists in a moral vacuum. The gangsters have sent all the good people packing and paid for the law as they have bought most of the women. Women decorate the periphery of "Last Man Standing' in minor roles as hostages, whores, and mistresses. These unhappy females are trapped in Jericho as male playthings and the consequences of defiance carry a high price as one girl learns. When John Smith (Bruce Willis of "Die Hard") wheels his Ford into the dusty, remote town of Jericho, he is searching for a quiet place to lay low before he vanishes into Mexico. What he encounters are two greedy Chicago bootlegging clans competing for supremacy over the illegal whiskey trade. Like Clint Eastwood in "A Fistful of Dollars," Smith smells money galore in "Last Man Standing" so he hires out his pistols to the highest bidders. Smith plays the Italians and the Irish skillfully against each other in a suspenseful game of cat and mouse. When he helps a young woman held hostage by the Irish, Smith finally pays for his interference. The Irish gang, headed by Doyle (Daniel Patrick Kelly), captures and stomps our protagonist until he resembles a bruised tomato. Somehow, Smith endures this horrible beating and gets away. Furiously, Doyle massacres the Italian leader, Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg), and his gang at a roadhouse where the Irish believe Smith has filed for protection. Instead, Smith holes up out of town in a church to recover his strength. Jericho's corrupt sheriff (Bruce Dern of "The Cowboys"), decides to help Smith out by loaning him two guns. Smith takes the hardware and challenges the Irish to a Wild West showdown. As his own scenarist, director Walter Hill has kept most of the original story intact. If you're looking for comparisons, you might find it easier to correlate "Last Man Standing" with "A Fistful of Dollars" rather than "Yojimbo." As the writer, Hill fumbles in making the evil, Tommy-gun toting Hickey (Christopher Walken of "The Anderson Tapes") a henchman rather than the boss, as the corresponding character was in "A Fistful of Dollars." He is the only match bullet-for-bullet with Smith. As Hickey, Christopher Walken adds another despicable villain to his cinematic gallery of rogues, playing second fiddle to Doyle. Hill generates minor suspense when lesser characters refer to Hickey's character and the hellishness that always follows in his wake. "Last Man Standing" is a raw, hard-bitten, little, B-move shoot'em-up with A-class pretensions that pays homage to not only Kurosawa but also stylishly imitates the excessive violence from recent Hong Kong crime thrillers. If you want to compare it to one of Bruce's American thrillers, the Tony Scott directed bullet ballet "The Last Boy Scout" (1991) is the best example. Hill the writer doesn't waste time contriving an elaborate plot that hinges on small but crucial details. When characters are not performing tasks on-screen, they are deployed off-screen in plot related activities. This is one who where what the characters do off-screen is of integral importance to what others do on-screen. Compared with Clint Eastwood who played the Man with No Name in "A Fistful of Dollars," Bruce Willis here is the Man With Anybody's Name. As he reveals to the Italians, he is simply John Smith from back East. John Smith is a taciturn fellow. He doesn't make a big deal out of most things unless he finds his expertise challenged. If you're a Willis fan, "Last Man Standing" isn't Bruce as usual. He is neither "Die Hard" Detective John McClane nor is he David Addison from "Moonlighting." He is a man of few words and fewer wisecracks. Smith is an unrepentant hard-case who admits as much without remorse during his opening narration. Here Willis delineates the character of Smith more out of what is left unsaid rather than said. The film amounts to a genre mash-up: a period crime drama crossed with a western. In it, the Old West is a dying dream. The New West, suggests Hill, is being taken over by business suits from back East with hardware. Nevertheless, that Wild West justice might be out of sight but it's not entirely out of mind. Altogether, "Last Man Standing" qualifies as a loud, bloody shoot'em-up that shouldn't disappoint action fans.

    This film doesn't do much wrong except not really doing much right. The mood and feel of a small American western town in Prohibition is nicely put across, borrowing something from films like Eastwood's 'Unforgiven'. The acting is fine, particularly from the always-reliable Christopher Walken who once again lights up more of his role than is asked of him. But the story adaption is a little tired and Willis's "It was a dirty town but all towns were" voice-over feels dated rather than nostalgic. The bad guys are all a bit too thick to seem like adversaries so it feels like any successes of Willis's are inevitable. That makes it hard for the film to keep you wondering as the story appears to just play itself out.

    Last Man Standing is directed by Walter Hill who also adapts the screenplay from a story written by Ry&ucirc;z&ocirc; Kikushima and Akira Kurosawa. It stars Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern, William Sanderson, Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, Karina Lombard and Ned Eisenberg. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern. Walter Hill's variant on Yojimbo, plot basically sees Willis as drifter John Smith, who after arriving in the dusty town of Jericho, promptly sets about making some serious cash by playing the town's two gangs off against each other. Smith is one tough hombre, a deadly pistoleer who has a fear of nothing, which is why the two respective gang leaders want him to work for them. Noses get put out of joint, blood flows, scores settled and a anti-hero is born, complete with permanent scowl and dry narration. The look and sound is terrific, Cooder's pessimistic twangs are all over the plot, while the visuals dovetail between sun-baked landscapes and the misty lensed ghost town of Jericho. Hill brings his trademark stylish violence into play, with slow-mos and rapid fire shoot-outs impressive, while his skill at creating an antique atmosphere is very much in evidence. Unfortunately the narrative isn't up to much, it lacks scope and characters merely exist, making this very much a style over substance exercise. It also means that much of the cast are given only morsels to feed on. A shame when you got Walken and Kelly on overdrive when on screen. It's an odd blend of a Western with Prohibition Noir characters, but it's unmistakably a Walter Hill film. For his fans there's enough to like about it whilst accepting it's a bit of a throwaway on the page. For the casual crime/action film fan, however, it's likely to be much ado about nothing. 7/10

    Walter Hill's dusty non-starter sees sphincter-mouthed shooter Bruce Willis and his bottomless gun clips decimate two rival gangs who have taken over a small town, playing them off against each other while downing shots and whispering a lot. The movie only really throws sparks when Ken 'Kelso' Jenkins pops up with the film's best performance, although there are a few signs of life whenever Christopher Walken appears. But only a few; this is a boring film, slackly paced and slathered in world weary dialogue that's less hard boiled, more over-baked. It comes off as a film that's trying too hard.

If you're looking for comparisons, you might find it easier to correlate "Last Man Standing" with "A Fistful of Dollars" rather than "Yojimbo." As the writer, Hill fumbles in making the evil, Tommy-gun toting Hickey (Christopher Walken of "The Anderson Tapes") a henchman rather than the boss, as the corresponding character was in "A Fistful of Dollars." He is the only match bullet-for-bullet with Smith. As Hickey, Christopher Walken adds another despicable villain to his cinematic gallery of rogues, playing second fiddle to Doyle. Hill generates minor suspense when lesser characters refer to Hickey's character and the hellishness that always follows in his wake. "Last Man Standing" is a raw, hard-bitten, little, B-move shoot'em-up with A-class pretensions that pays homage to not only Kurosawa but also stylishly imitates the excessive violence from recent Hong Kong crime thrillers. If you want to compare it to one of Bruce's American thrillers, the Tony Scott directed bullet ballet "The Last Boy Scout" (1991) is the best example. Hill the writer doesn't waste time contriving an elaborate plot that hinges on small but crucial details. When characters are not performing tasks on-screen, they are deployed off-screen in plot related activities. This is one who where what the characters do off-screen is of integral importance to what others do on-screen. Compared with Clint Eastwood who played the Man with No Name in "A Fistful of Dollars," Bruce Willis here is the Man With Anybody's Name. As he reveals to the Italians, he is simply John Smith from back East. John Smith is a taciturn fellow. He doesn't make a big deal out of most things unless he finds his expertise challenged. If you're a Willis fan, "Last Man Standing" isn't Bruce as usual. He is neither "Die Hard" Detective John McClane nor is he David Addison from "Moonlighting." He is a man of few words and fewer wisecracks. Smith is an unrepentant hard-case who admits as much without remorse during his opening narration. Here Willis delineates the character of Smith more out of what is left unsaid rather than said. The film amounts to a genre mash-up: a period crime drama crossed with a western. In it, the Old West is a dying dream. The New West, suggests Hill, is being taken over by business suits from back East with hardware. Nevertheless, that Wild West justice might be out of sight but it's not entirely out of mind. Altogether, "Last Man Standing" qualifies as a loud, bloody shoot'em-up that shouldn't disappoint action fans.

    This film doesn't do much wrong except not really doing much right. The mood and feel of a small American western town in Prohibition is nicely put across, borrowing something from films like Eastwood's 'Unforgiven'. The acting is fine, particularly from the always-reliable Christopher Walken who once again lights up more of his role than is asked of him. But the story adaption is a little tired and Willis's "It was a dirty town but all towns were" voice-over feels dated rather than nostalgic. The bad guys are all a bit too thick to seem like adversaries so it feels like any successes of Willis's are inevitable. That makes it hard for the film to keep you wondering as the story appears to just play itself out.

    Last Man Standing is directed by Walter Hill who also adapts the screenplay from a story written by Ry&ucirc;z&ocirc; Kikushima and Akira Kurosawa. It stars Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern, William Sanderson, Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, Karina Lombard and Ned Eisenberg. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern. Walter Hill's variant on Yojimbo, plot basically sees Willis as drifter John Smith, who after arriving in the dusty town of Jericho, promptly sets about making some serious cash by playing the town's two gangs off against each other. Smith is one tough hombre, a deadly pistoleer who has a fear of nothing, which is why the two respective gang leaders want him to work for them. Noses get put out of joint, blood flows, scores settled and a anti-hero is born, complete with permanent scowl and dry narration. The look and sound is terrific, Cooder's pessimistic twangs are all over the plot, while the visuals dovetail between sun-baked landscapes and the misty lensed ghost town of Jericho. Hill brings his trademark stylish violence into play, with slow-mos and rapid fire shoot-outs impressive, while his skill at creating an antique atmosphere is very much in evidence. Unfortunately the narrative isn't up to much, it lacks scope and characters merely exist, making this very much a style over substance exercise. It also means that much of the cast are given only morsels to feed on. A shame when you got Walken and Kelly on overdrive when on screen. It's an odd blend of a Western with Prohibition Noir characters, but it's unmistakably a Walter Hill film. For his fans there's enough to like about it whilst accepting it's a bit of a throwaway on the page. For the casual crime/action film fan, however, it's likely to be much ado about nothing. 7/10

    Walter Hill's dusty non-starter sees sphincter-mouthed shooter Bruce Willis and his bottomless gun clips decimate two rival gangs who have taken over a small town, playing them off against each other while downing shots and whispering a lot. The movie only really throws sparks when Ken 'Kelso' Jenkins pops up with the film's best performance, although there are a few signs of life whenever Christopher Walken appears. But only a few; this is a boring film, slackly paced and slathered in world weary dialogue that's less hard boiled, more over-baked. It comes off as a film that's trying too hard.

Close ups and wide outdoor scenes have a special quality that are sure to satisfy your visual experience. Thank you for this visual spectacular. Normally I hate films with a a narrator (show me, don't tell me!), but this film's lighting and framing captured me. I hope other directors, artistic directors, and editors learn from this film and know that the audience can be immersed in the visual spectacle.

    Again another movie that just does not make any sense to me. I personally love action movies. But there has to be at least a minimum amount of story and realism behind the whole thing. There were so many strange inconsistencies in this movie. How can the protagonist enter a room with at least 15 men in it, start shooting around with only 2 pistols, standing in just one place without moving, and not get hit once? Why did they beat up the protagonist, went away and came back minutes later? why not kill him directly? Why was the showdown between hickey and John Smith such a let down? Why did hickey just stand around and let smith shoot without any resistance? Why built up such a super villain just to let him die in such an easy way? Strange movie, strange ending, not a lot of entertainment. I would say a waste of time.

    This movie is a remake of Clint Eastwood's Fistfull of Dollars, which in turn is a remake of Yojimbo. The movie itself is set in the 1920's yet it still has the trademark Western aspects, namely the taming of a savage land. Bruce Willis plays John Smith (which is really a man with no name) who stumbles on a border town in which two gangs fight for control. Upon learning this, Willis decides that it is in his best interest to stay in the town, play each gang up against the other, and then walk out with a lot of money. This is really an action/western style movie. It has its fair share of gunfights, but beyond that it really seems to have little to keep one interested in it. I liked the film though. The gunfights were well executed and there was a few witty remarks scattered across it. The lack of a real cohesive plot comes through the direction of the movie. It is focused on one man who decides to stick his meddling fingers into a dangerous situation. Inevitably everybody catches on to him and puts him through hell, though he manages to deal with them all in the end. The thing about Willis' character is that it has a self-admitted flaw and that is his lust for woman. He seems to be a cold hearted man but he is willing to always kick back with a lovely lady. A number of times he almost meets his end, but inevitably he manages to survive. The dusty, empty town gives it a nice feel to it, and though the movie is overtly long, it is one that Western fans and even those who like action movies should give it a go. It is not the best of movies, but it is good enough to stand on its own.

    One of our most underrated Directors Walter Hill is all over this Movie. His macho style and swagger is forefront and the stylist is on his game with violence and hard edged beauty. It is Neo-Noir for sure as our Anti-Hero enters a one (dead) horse town on the border, his voice-over narration ("then I saw her and the fun started") tells us we are back with Hammett and Chandler. This one starts off with action and only lets up occasionally to fill in the dusty plot of females in distress and prohibition Gang rivalry. This one, as are most of Hill's Films, is overlooked and under-appreciated. It is a slam bang salutation to Akira Kurosawa and Sergio Leone. A great cast are all in on the fun and this delivers everything in the tradition.

    an amoral gunslinger in the days of Prohibition, on the run from his latest exploits, happens upon the town of Jericho, Texas. It has become more like a ghost town, since two warring gangs have driven off all the decent folk. Smith sees an opportunity to play both sides off against each other, earning himself a nice piece of change as a hired gun. Despite his strictly avowed mercenary intentions, he finds himself risking his life for his, albeit skewed, sense of honour.... Made at a time when Willis was struggling to make it big at the box office, it comes as no surprise that this disappeared pretty rapidly at the cinema. But it's still a solid action movie, which is slightly tarnished as a remake of a remake and so on. Willis is great as always as John, the gunslinger who is playing off each gang. Hill directs the action pieces with expertise, and it's a lovely move having Walken appear int he second act, all the time before with his gang mentioning him in passing. Why this cost so much to make, I have no idea, because the production values are not the best, but it has an eclectic cast, who really know how the liven up an average script. There are plot holes aplenty, but it's a swift movie, with hardly any pauses, and it's one of Willis' hidden gems. See it as a throwaway action movie, and you'll enjoy it

    The movie tells the story of a loner going to Jericho, Texas which is a border town near Mexico and gets mixed up with two rival booze gangs during prohibition. Bruce plays the main character named John Smith which is basically a way of calling him a Name with No Name like Clint Eastwood's character was in the Dollars Trilogy. Smith plays the two gangs against each other leveraging them from more money until things get out of hand and eventually he has to choose between the two. The movie has a really good cast with Bruce Dern, Leslie Mann, Christopher Walken, Michael Imperioli amongst others. The movie is basically a remake of the Kurosawa film Yojimbo and while it doesn't quite equal the heights of that it's a solid film but not great.

    International filmmakers have exerted great influence on American movies. When Hollywood runs out of fresh ideas, the major studios often turn to foreign films for inspiration. Sometimes, a filmmaker appears who can adapt a foreign film in such a revolutionary way that audiences sits up and pays attention. "Extreme Prejudice" writer & director Walter Hill manages this ambitious feat in his cinematic version of the 1961 Japanese samurai epic "Yojimbo" by the brilliant director Akira Kurosawa. Incidentally, "Yojimbo" translated means "bodyguard." In the 1950s and 1960s, Kurosawa emerged as one of the few Asian filmmakers who commanded the respect of American audiences. His films grew popular in the West. Moreover, Kurosawa translated profitably in westerns. His films have served as the basis for John Sturges' 1960 classic "The Magnificent Seven," Sergio Leone's landmark Spaghetti western "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964), and now Walter Hill's "Last Man Standing." Hill recycles the venerable Kurosawa tale as a Prohibition Era gangster saga, casting Bruce Willis as a tight-lipped soldier of fortune with two automatics and an attitude. The story contains all the subtlety of a hail of lead delivered at point blank range, and "Last Man Standing" erupts with the fury of an artillery barrage. The setting of Jericho, Texas, exists in a moral vacuum. The gangsters have sent all the good people packing and paid for the law as they have bought most of the women. Women decorate the periphery of "Last Man Standing' in minor roles as hostages, whores, and mistresses. These unhappy females are trapped in Jericho as male playthings and the consequences of defiance carry a high price as one girl learns. When John Smith (Bruce Willis of "Die Hard") wheels his Ford into the dusty, remote town of Jericho, he is searching for a quiet place to lay low before he vanishes into Mexico. What he encounters are two greedy Chicago bootlegging clans competing for supremacy over the illegal whiskey trade. Like Clint Eastwood in "A Fistful of Dollars," Smith smells money galore in "Last Man Standing" so he hires out his pistols to the highest bidders. Smith plays the Italians and the Irish skillfully against each other in a suspenseful game of cat and mouse. When he helps a young woman held hostage by the Irish, Smith finally pays for his interference. The Irish gang, headed by Doyle (Daniel Patrick Kelly), captures and stomps our protagonist until he resembles a bruised tomato. Somehow, Smith endures this horrible beating and gets away. Furiously, Doyle massacres the Italian leader, Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg), and his gang at a roadhouse where the Irish believe Smith has filed for protection. Instead, Smith holes up out of town in a church to recover his strength. Jericho's corrupt sheriff (Bruce Dern of "The Cowboys"), decides to help Smith out by loaning him two guns. Smith takes the hardware and challenges the Irish to a Wild West showdown. As his own scenarist, director Walter Hill has kept most of the original story intact. If you're looking for comparisons, you might find it easier to correlate "Last Man Standing" with "A Fistful of Dollars" rather than "Yojimbo." As the writer, Hill fumbles in making the evil, Tommy-gun toting Hickey (Christopher Walken of "The Anderson Tapes") a henchman rather than the boss, as the corresponding character was in "A Fistful of Dollars." He is the only match bullet-for-bullet with Smith. As Hickey, Christopher Walken adds another despicable villain to his cinematic gallery of rogues, playing second fiddle to Doyle. Hill generates minor suspense when lesser characters refer to Hickey's character and the hellishness that always follows in his wake. "Last Man Standing" is a raw, hard-bitten, little, B-move shoot'em-up with A-class pretensions that pays homage to not only Kurosawa but also stylishly imitates the excessive violence from recent Hong Kong crime thrillers. If you want to compare it to one of Bruce's American thrillers, the Tony Scott directed bullet ballet "The Last Boy Scout" (1991) is the best example. Hill the writer doesn't waste time contriving an elaborate plot that hinges on small but crucial details. When characters are not performing tasks on-screen, they are deployed off-screen in plot related activities. This is one who where what the characters do off-screen is of integral importance to what others do on-screen. Compared with Clint Eastwood who played the Man with No Name in "A Fistful of Dollars," Bruce Willis here is the Man With Anybody's Name. As he reveals to the Italians, he is simply John Smith from back East. John Smith is a taciturn fellow. He doesn't make a big deal out of most things unless he finds his expertise challenged. If you're a Willis fan, "Last Man Standing" isn't Bruce as usual. He is neither "Die Hard" Detective John McClane nor is he David Addison from "Moonlighting." He is a man of few words and fewer wisecracks. Smith is an unrepentant hard-case who admits as much without remorse during his opening narration. Here Willis delineates the character of Smith more out of what is left unsaid rather than said. The film amounts to a genre mash-up: a period crime drama crossed with a western. In it, the Old West is a dying dream. The New West, suggests Hill, is being taken over by business suits from back East with hardware. Nevertheless, that Wild West justice might be out of sight but it's not entirely out of mind. Altogether, "Last Man Standing" qualifies as a loud, bloody shoot'em-up that shouldn't disappoint action fans.

    Last Man Standing is directed by Walter Hill who also adapts the screenplay from a story written by Ry&ucirc;z&ocirc; Kikushima and Akira Kurosawa. It stars Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern, William Sanderson, Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, Karina Lombard and Ned Eisenberg. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern. Walter Hill's variant on Yojimbo, plot basically sees Willis as drifter John Smith, who after arriving in the dusty town of Jericho, promptly sets about making some serious cash by playing the town's two gangs off against each other. Smith is one tough hombre, a deadly pistoleer who has a fear of nothing, which is why the two respective gang leaders want him to work for them. Noses get put out of joint, blood flows, scores settled and a anti-hero is born, complete with permanent scowl and dry narration. The look and sound is terrific, Cooder's pessimistic twangs are all over the plot, while the visuals dovetail between sun-baked landscapes and the misty lensed ghost town of Jericho. Hill brings his trademark stylish violence into play, with slow-mos and rapid fire shoot-outs impressive, while his skill at creating an antique atmosphere is very much in evidence. Unfortunately the narrative isn't up to much, it lacks scope and characters merely exist, making this very much a style over substance exercise. It also means that much of the cast are given only morsels to feed on. A shame when you got Walken and Kelly on overdrive when on screen.

    International filmmakers have exerted great influence on American movies. When Hollywood runs out of fresh ideas, the major studios often turn to foreign films for inspiration. Sometimes, a filmmaker appears who can adapt a foreign film in such a revolutionary way that audiences sits up and pays attention. "Extreme Prejudice" writer & director Walter Hill manages this ambitious feat in his cinematic version of the 1961 Japanese samurai epic "Yojimbo" by the brilliant director Akira Kurosawa. Incidentally, "Yojimbo" translated means "bodyguard." In the 1950s and 1960s, Kurosawa emerged as one of the few Asian filmmakers who commanded the respect of American audiences. His films grew popular in the West. Moreover, Kurosawa translated profitably in westerns. His films have served as the basis for John Sturges' 1960 classic "The Magnificent Seven," Sergio Leone's landmark Spaghetti western "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964), and now Walter Hill's "Last Man Standing." Hill recycles the venerable Kurosawa tale as a Prohibition Era gangster saga, casting Bruce Willis as a tight-lipped soldier of fortune with two automatics and an attitude. The story contains all the subtlety of a hail of lead delivered at point blank range, and "Last Man Standing" erupts with the fury of an artillery barrage. The setting of Jericho, Texas, exists in a moral vacuum. The gangsters have sent all the good people packing and paid for the law as they have bought most of the women. Women decorate the periphery of "Last Man Standing' in minor roles as hostages, whores, and mistresses. These unhappy females are trapped in Jericho as male playthings and the consequences of defiance carry a high price as one girl learns. When John Smith (Bruce Willis of "Die Hard") wheels his Ford into the dusty, remote town of Jericho, he is searching for a quiet place to lay low before he vanishes into Mexico. What he encounters are two greedy Chicago bootlegging clans competing for supremacy over the illegal whiskey trade. Like Clint Eastwood in "A Fistful of Dollars," Smith smells money galore in "Last Man Standing" so he hires out his pistols to the highest bidders. Smith plays the Italians and the Irish skillfully against each other in a suspenseful game of cat and mouse. When he helps a young woman held hostage by the Irish, Smith finally pays for his interference. The Irish gang, headed by Doyle (Daniel Patrick Kelly), captures and stomps our protagonist until he resembles a bruised tomato. Somehow, Smith endures this horrible beating and gets away. Furiously, Doyle massacres the Italian leader, Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg), and his gang at a roadhouse where the Irish believe Smith has filed for protection. Instead, Smith holes up out of town in a church to recover his strength. Jericho's corrupt sheriff (Bruce Dern of "The Cowboys"), decides to help Smith out by loaning him two guns. Smith takes the hardware and challenges the Irish to a Wild West showdown. As his own scenarist, director Walter Hill has kept most of the original story intact. If you're looking for comparisons, you might find it easier to correlate "Last Man Standing" with "A Fistful of Dollars" rather than "Yojimbo." As the writer, Hill fumbles in making the evil, Tommy-gun toting Hickey (Christopher Walken of "The Anderson Tapes") a henchman rather than the boss, as the corresponding character was in "A Fistful of Dollars." He is the only match bullet-for-bullet with Smith. As Hickey, Christopher Walken adds another despicable villain to his cinematic gallery of rogues, playing second fiddle to Doyle. Hill generates minor suspense when lesser characters refer to Hickey's character and the hellishness that always follows in his wake. "Last Man Standing" is a raw, hard-bitten, little, B-move shoot'em-up with A-class pretensions that pays homage to not only Kurosawa but also stylishly imitates the excessive violence from recent Hong Kong crime thrillers. If you want to compare it to one of Bruce's American thrillers, the Tony Scott directed bullet ballet "The Last Boy Scout" (1991) is the best example. Hill the writer doesn't waste time contriving an elaborate plot that hinges on small but crucial details. When characters are not performing tasks on-screen, they are deployed off-screen in plot related activities. This is one who where what the characters do off-screen is of integral importance to what others do on-screen. Compared with Clint Eastwood who played the Man with No Name in "A Fistful of Dollars," Bruce Willis here is the Man With Anybody's Name. As he reveals to the Italians, he is simply John Smith from back East. John Smith is a taciturn fellow. He doesn't make a big deal out of most things unless he finds his expertise challenged. If you're a Willis fan, "Last Man Standing" isn't Bruce as usual. He is neither "Die Hard" Detective John McClane nor is he David Addison from "Moonlighting." He is a man of few words and fewer wisecracks. Smith is an unrepentant hard-case who admits as much without remorse during his opening narration. Here Willis delineates the character of Smith more out of what is left unsaid rather than said. The film amounts to a genre mash-up: a period crime drama crossed with a western. In it, the Old West is a dying dream. The New West, suggests Hill, is being taken over by business suits from back East with hardware. Nevertheless, that Wild West justice might be out of sight but it's not entirely out of mind. Altogether, "Last Man Standing" qualifies as a loud, bloody shoot'em-up that shouldn't disappoint action fans.

    This film doesn't do much wrong except not really doing much right. The mood and feel of a small American western town in Prohibition is nicely put across, borrowing something from films like Eastwood's 'Unforgiven'. The acting is fine, particularly from the always-reliable Christopher Walken who once again lights up more of his role than is asked of him. But the story adaption is a little tired and Willis's "It was a dirty town but all towns were" voice-over feels dated rather than nostalgic. The bad guys are all a bit too thick to seem like adversaries so it feels like any successes of Willis's are inevitable. That makes it hard for the film to keep you wondering as the story appears to just play itself out.

    Last Man Standing is directed by Walter Hill who also adapts the screenplay from a story written by Ry&ucirc;z&ocirc; Kikushima and Akira Kurosawa. It stars Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern, William Sanderson, Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, Karina Lombard and Ned Eisenberg. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern. Walter Hill's variant on Yojimbo, plot basically sees Willis as drifter John Smith, who after arriving in the dusty town of Jericho, promptly sets about making some serious cash by playing the town's two gangs off against each other. Smith is one tough hombre, a deadly pistoleer who has a fear of nothing, which is why the two respective gang leaders want him to work for them. Noses get put out of joint, blood flows, scores settled and a anti-hero is born, complete with permanent scowl and dry narration. The look and sound is terrific, Cooder's pessimistic twangs are all over the plot, while the visuals dovetail between sun-baked landscapes and the misty lensed ghost town of Jericho. Hill brings his trademark stylish violence into play, with slow-mos and rapid fire shoot-outs impressive, while his skill at creating an antique atmosphere is very much in evidence. Unfortunately the narrative isn't up to much, it lacks scope and characters merely exist, making this very much a style over substance exercise. It also means that much of the cast are given only morsels to feed on. A shame when you got Walken and Kelly on overdrive when on screen. It's an odd blend of a Western with Prohibition Noir characters, but it's unmistakably a Walter Hill film. For his fans there's enough to like about it whilst accepting it's a bit of a throwaway on the page. For the casual crime/action film fan, however, it's likely to be much ado about nothing. 7/10

    Walter Hill's dusty non-starter sees sphincter-mouthed shooter Bruce Willis and his bottomless gun clips decimate two rival gangs who have taken over a small town, playing them off against each other while downing shots and whispering a lot. The movie only really throws sparks when Ken 'Kelso' Jenkins pops up with the film's best performance, although there are a few signs of life whenever Christopher Walken appears. But only a few; this is a boring film, slackly paced and slathered in world weary dialogue that's less hard boiled, more over-baked. It comes off as a film that's trying too hard.

    This is strikingly visual. Even if you mute the audio (which I don't recommend), it is amazing to view. Notice the lighting especially. Close ups and wide outdoor scenes have a special quality that are sure to satisfy your visual experience. Thank you for this visual spectacular. Normally I hate films with a a narrator (show me, don't tell me!), but this film's lighting and framing captured me. I hope other directors, artistic directors, and editors learn from this film and know that the audience can be immersed in the visual spectacle. Even if you hate the script (I didn't, I liked it), _watch_ it and be amazed.

    Again another movie that just does not make any sense to me. I personally love action movies. But there has to be at least a minimum amount of story and realism behind the whole thing. There were so many strange inconsistencies in this movie. How can the protagonist enter a room with at least 15 men in it, start shooting around with only 2 pistols, standing in just one place without moving, and not get hit once? Why did they beat up the protagonist, went away and came back minutes later? why not kill him directly? Why was the showdown between hickey and John Smith such a let down? Why did hickey just stand around and let smith shoot without any resistance? Why built up such a super villain just to let him die in such an easy way? Strange movie, strange ending, not a lot of entertainment. I would say a waste of time.

    This movie is a remake of Clint Eastwood's Fistfull of Dollars, which in turn is a remake of Yojimbo. The movie itself is set in the 1920's yet it still has the trademark Western aspects, namely the taming of a savage land. Bruce Willis plays John Smith (which is really a man with no name) who stumbles on a border town in which two gangs fight for control. Upon learning this, Willis decides that it is in his best interest to stay in the town, play each gang up against the other, and then walk out with a lot of money. This is really an action/western style movie. It has its fair share of gunfights, but beyond that it really seems to have little to keep one interested in it. I liked the film though. The gunfights were well executed and there was a few witty remarks scattered across it. The lack of a real cohesive plot comes through the direction of the movie. It is focused on one man who decides to stick his meddling fingers into a dangerous situation. Inevitably everybody catches on to him and puts him through hell, though he manages to deal with them all in the end. The thing about Willis' character is that it has a self-admitted flaw and that is his lust for woman. He seems to be a cold hearted man but he is willing to always kick back with a lovely lady. A number of times he almost meets his end, but inevitably he manages to survive. The dusty, empty town gives it a nice feel to it, and though the movie is overtly long, it is one that Western fans and even those who like action movies should give it a go. It is not the best of movies, but it is good enough to stand on its own.

    One of our most underrated Directors Walter Hill is all over this Movie. His macho style and swagger is forefront and the stylist is on his game with violence and hard edged beauty. It is Neo-Noir for sure as our Anti-Hero enters a one (dead) horse town on the border, his voice-over narration ("then I saw her and the fun started") tells us we are back with Hammett and Chandler. This one starts off with action and only lets up occasionally to fill in the dusty plot of females in distress and prohibition Gang rivalry. This one, as are most of Hill's Films, is overlooked and under-appreciated. It is a slam bang salutation to Akira Kurosawa and Sergio Leone. A great cast are all in on the fun and this delivers everything in the tradition.

    an amoral gunslinger in the days of Prohibition, on the run from his latest exploits, happens upon the town of Jericho, Texas. It has become more like a ghost town, since two warring gangs have driven off all the decent folk. Smith sees an opportunity to play both sides off against each other, earning himself a nice piece of change as a hired gun. Despite his strictly avowed mercenary intentions, he finds himself risking his life for his, albeit skewed, sense of honour.... Made at a time when Willis was struggling to make it big at the box office, it comes as no surprise that this disappeared pretty rapidly at the cinema. But it's still a solid action movie, which is slightly tarnished as a remake of a remake and so on. Willis is great as always as John, the gunslinger who is playing off each gang. Hill directs the action pieces with expertise, and it's a lovely move having Walken appear int he second act, all the time before with his gang mentioning him in passing. Why this cost so much to make, I have no idea, because the production values are not the best, but it has an eclectic cast, who really know how the liven up an average script. There are plot holes aplenty, but it's a swift movie, with hardly any pauses, and it's one of Willis' hidden gems. See it as a throwaway action movie, and you'll enjoy it

    The movie tells the story of a loner going to Jericho, Texas which is a border town near Mexico and gets mixed up with two rival booze gangs during prohibition. Bruce plays the main character named John Smith which is basically a way of calling him a Name with No Name like Clint Eastwood's character was in the Dollars Trilogy. Smith plays the two gangs against each other leveraging them from more money until things get out of hand and eventually he has to choose between the two. The movie has a really good cast with Bruce Dern, Leslie Mann, Christopher Walken, Michael Imperioli amongst others. The movie is basically a remake of the Kurosawa film Yojimbo and while it doesn't quite equal the heights of that it's a solid film but not great.
