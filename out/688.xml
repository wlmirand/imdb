    This film would have been complete if cameos were made by Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow who reluctantly declined to appear in this television show to film adaptation. It's not a bad film. The actor who plays Beaver is quite cute and funny at times. His parents are played well by Janine Turner and Christopher McDonald. Wally is played okay by Erik Von Detten. The story is about a small kid nicknamed the Beaver who manages to get into trouble with all sorts. It's funny to see him on the football team where he's so much smaller than his teammates. Also, the gags are quite silly and physical but nothing too much. Beaver always manages to get into some sort of trouble when he's not trying too. Barbara Billingsley who played June Cleaver in the series makes a cameo as Aunt Martha. It's not a bad film for kids and even adults to lighten the mood.

    Before watching the film, I realized it must have been quite a challenge, not to the actors, but to the writers, to update it. With knowledge of writing, I figured one writer could probably do it, but that a team would probably dilute it terribly. Four writers are listed, two as major writers, so it isn't as badly diluted as if a large team did it. And the writers did well. We have an up to date Beaver, with an up to date world, but still keeping in the story line of basic day to day life struggles, and drawing some comedy from them. If I was to nit pick, it would be at the parents. Ward and June are nothing like the old series. While the other characters seemed perfectly cast, it looked like there was an attempt to deviate from Beaumont and Billingsley in the portrayal of the parents. Hugh's Ward was not nearly the pretty boy we see in this movie. Nor was he as ill tempered. Hugh was the personification of moderation. That said, the actors were all very good. I've worked in little "real life" depiction films before, and each scene is extremely time consuming to film, and the more "ordinary" a scene appears, the more time it takes to film it. This, of course, is because Fantasy can have multiple depictions, but watching a grade school Football game is "watching a grade school Football game", and less can be left to chance. In these scenes, it really looks like all the participants were very patient. Not many people realize how much tougher an innocuous movie like this is to film. I always laugh when small movie producers will be reluctant to do a Fantasy based movie because of budget, when the budget for this sort of film is set at a large scale, while one can be lax with the other. This new LEAVE IT TO BEAVER did a lot of very good things. The way the characters interwove throughout the piece was especially good. A little storybook? Not nearly so much as one would think, and no more story book than mere coincidence of all that can happen in a day will allow. It looks like the writers spent a ton of energy into interweaving the characters in the story, and came up with a very elaborate, well designed scheme. Some very well done scenes, like the skating rink, but it's not fair to single these out, because all of the scenes were well done. I won't credit the director for keeping an entire cast and crew in line, because it is the cast and crew who deserve credit for their patience. Anyone could direct a team as disciplined as this. That's not to put down the director. You have only to look at my high rating of the film to know how I feel about that. Everything was well done. I was pleasantly surprised.

    Theodore "Beaver" Cleaver (Cameron Finley) is a prone-to-be- trouble third grader in Mayfield, the typical All-American community. His parents Ward (Christopher McDonald) and June (Janine Turner) love their younger son but are often exasperated at his failings. Older sibling, Wally (Erik Von Detten) tries to help his brother out of most scrapes. But, even delivering papers can result in disaster for the pie truck driver. When Beaver announces he is going out for football, his dad is so pleased that he gives Beaver what he wants most for his birthday, a new bike. However, a tricky older boy steals Beave's bicycle from under his nose. Ward and June are not happy. Meanwhile, Eddie Haskell continues to drop gushing compliments to all, especially Mrs. Cleaver, and convinces Wally to help him get close to a pretty girl, Karen (Erika Christensen). But, Karen has eyes for Wally. As Beaver continues to try to reclaim his bike, Wally falls for Karen, and Ward goes love-crazy when June does the house cleaning in pearls, what is ahead for the Cleaver clan? All right, I understand Beaver purists will not be happy with this screen version, for the squeaky-clean theme is not present. This is a tongue-in-cheek version, yes, so those with an open mind can give themselves a license to laugh. The opening montage, with Wally and the Beave delivering papers with disastrous results, is a keeper. So is Theodore's first day of third grade, where the teacher becomes sorry she ever asked what each student did over the summer. And, so it continues. All of the cast members are great and the script-direction is full of mirth and energy. The costumes are a hoot for they are "knock-offs" of fifties styles without being the genuine article and the production values are extremely high. All in all, don't be peeved at this film version of a television classic. Everyone loves the original, certainly, but most will be able to appreciate the funny send-up this flick offers the viewing audience.

    My mom tells me about how, when she watched the original "Leave It to Beaver" TV series, she said: "Real people don't live like this." Growing up as she did nearly dirt poor in a refinery town near Houston, a portrayal of a mom wearing a pearl necklace all day and a dad wearing a suit and tie to work simply does not look realistic. So, the "Leave It to Beaver" movie portrays the hapless kid causing all sorts of trouble, while his practically perfect parents always try to give him good advice. My advice to you is to skip this movie. It's movies like this that make the rest of the world consider American movies to be the worst (at least that's an accurate view of most Hollywood movies). There are far better movies out there. Nineteen ninety-seven alone gave us "Fierce Creatures", "Donnie Brasco", "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery", "The Fifth Element", "Men in Black", "In & Out", "The Ice Storm", "LA Confidential", "Jackie Brown", "Wag the Dog", Good Will Hunting" and "As Good as It Gets" - and those are just the good American movies; travel outside our borders and you find "The Full Monty" - so there's no reason to let this one represent that year. All in all, pitiful.

    As someone who grew up watching "Leave It To Beaver" on television, and now on DVD, this "upgraded" movie version is disgusting. Out-of-touch movie critics like Porter & Martin, who have a best-selling paperback book each year of short movie reviews of anything on tape or disc, called this "wholesome" fun. In fact, they said it was so wholesome kids of today might not want to see it, meaning it was too goody-goody for them. This shows you how out-of-touch film critics can be because compared to that 1950s show, this is HARDLY a wholesome movie. In this LITB, the young guys are all after girls and sex, use the word "suck" all the time and the story is filled with 1990s-type Hollywood portrayals and comments (Beaver was excited because he saw an R-rated movie, etc.) Overall, it's still a kid's movie and Cameron Finley is "cute" as Theodore "Beaver" Cleaver and his parents are nice, but there are too may moral problems with this version. Stick to the TV shows, especially now that the first two seasons on DVD. Those are fantastic.

    LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, in my opinion, is an excellent film adaptation of a classic TV show with appealing performances. Despite the fact that the punk (Glenn Harris Jr.) was a despicable thief, I fell madly in love with him. If you ask me, the way that Wally (Erik von Detten) fell for Karen (Erika Christensen) was absolutely romantic. When they were together in a scene, I felt really warm and tingly inside. Also, even though everyone gave an appealing performance, I liked the Beaver's (Cameron Finley) the best. In addition, I thought that Eddie (Adam Zolotin) was an unctuous guy. However, I thought that Judy (Brighton Hertford) and her mother (Shirley Prestia) were absolute b******. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent film adaptation of a classic TV show with appealing performances to any fan of the series who hasn't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.

    After hearing that Erik Von Detten was in this movie when he was younger... I was very curious to see it. Once the movie started, I could tell it was sort of a satire... which is totally cool and fun to watch. Beaver is a very charming character and Wally would be the perfect child if he acted the same in today's society. This movie had my attention the whole way through. It was totally cute, and had a lot of references that little kids may not "get" ... Erika Christiansen is in this movie too and she looked way different back then. I think they did a good job in this movie trying to portray the way children think and act and perceive the world. Although the mother is portrayed a bit like a Stepford Wife, it isn't that big of a distraction. You really begin to feel for the characters in this movie even though there hasn't been a whole lot of character development.

    Big screen treatment of the classic '50's comedy series. It's got size and color and a score and stunts, but little of the charm or innocence or sincerity of the original which is what made it great. The script is distractingly episodic. Over all it is slick enough to hold the attention of a child, but fans of the tv show should stay far away.

    [CONTAINS SPOILERS] It was a beautiful day in Mayfield Place then suddenly young Theodore "Beaver" Cleaver went on his paper route and accidentally caused many disasters, such as paint being spilled onto a businessman and a pie truck driver having to slam on the brakes just in time to see all his pies come raining down on him. Afterwards, Beaver and his brother Wally ride into town and stop by the bike shop where Beaver gazes at the shiny red bike in the window. He wanted it so much. Just then, Wally's conniving and sweet-talking friend Eddie Haskell came by and told Beaver the way to get something was to suck up to your parents like maybe joining the football team and then quitting once you got what you desired so when Ward got home that evening, Beaver announced that he would join the football team, only he soon learned that it isn't as easy as it looked but soon Beaver's birthday came. He got all sorts of cool gifts including a computer from Aunt Martha, but from Ward and June, Beaver got the bike he wanted! He was so thrilled! One afternoon, he, Wally and Eddie rode to the malt shop after school where Eddie planned to charm a girl, Karen, that he had a crush on. Wally went in with him and Beaver stayed with his bike. Just then a big kid came by and showed Beaver come cool tricks on his bike, then to Beaver's surprise, he rode off on Beaver's bike! He tried to chase him but it did no good. Wally and Beaver were sure Ward would blow his top so when they finally told him, he was quite disappointed in Beaver then he chastised Wally for not looking out for his brother which he later took out on Beaver and the two get into a fight, causing the computer to fall out the window. Karen was having a boy-girl party and invited Wally. She invited Eddie too, reluctantly. The party was a blast. No girl wanted to kiss poor Eddie, but Wally got some action from Karen! Beaver wasn't enjoying the football team and wanted to quit but Ward wouldn't have it. When Beaver's teacher, Miss Landers, offered to stay after school and help Beaver when he began falling behind, Beaver jumped at the opportunity to help him avoid football. Wally and Karen go ice skating that night and Eddie and Beaver follow and spy on them. Karen meets with an old friend, Kyle and the two leave together. Wally left distraught and ran into Beaver and Eddie. Kyle was friends with the bully who stole Beaver's bike and when Wally, Eddie and Beaver saw him, they gave chase but he gave them the slip. Literally. He dumped a bunch of fish in their paths. To make matters worse, the next day Beaver and his friend Larry saw Kyle and the bike thief and he wanted Beaver to settle a bet. Kyle thought that the giant coffee cup atop a coffee shop had real coffee in it and his friend thought it was a machine so they asked Beaver to climb up there and see which it was. If he did it, he would get his bike back so Beaver climbed to the top of the coffee shop and peered in. Suddenly he fell into the cup and couldn't get out. The two creeps left while Larry went to get the cops. Ward soon found out and climbed into the coffee cup with Beaver and the two had a heart-to-heart talk. Beaver decided to go back to the football team and helped his team win the big game! He saw the bike thief with the bike at the fair and gave chase. Kyle tripped Beaver but Wally shoved him into a vat of fudge. As for the bike thief, a quick thinking Beaver slammed him into a pie judging table. So in the end, Beaver got his bike back and Wally got his girl back and everyone was happy. A pretty good film. Great family entertainment! Christopher McDonald is Ward, Janine Turner is June, Erik Von Detten is Wally and Cameron Finley as the Beaver and he was exceptionally good in his part if I do say so myself! Watch for cameos by the original June, Barbara Billingsley as Aunt Martha, and the original Eddie, Ken Osmond as Eddie's dad! So if you're a fan of the '50s TV series or you're not, I recommend Leave it to Beaver! -

Even though it's pretty dumb, there's just a charm the film has that I can't help but notice every time it's on the Disney channel. It's fun for the whole family, and worth seeing.

    Big screen treatment of the classic '50's comedy series. It's got size and color and a score and stunts, but little of the charm or innocence or sincerity of the original which is what made it great. The script is distractingly episodic. Over all it is slick enough to hold the attention of a child, but fans of the tv show should stay far away.

    [CONTAINS SPOILERS] It was a beautiful day in Mayfield Place then suddenly young Theodore "Beaver" Cleaver went on his paper route and accidentally caused many disasters, such as paint being spilled onto a businessman and a pie truck driver having to slam on the brakes just in time to see all his pies come raining down on him. Afterwards, Beaver and his brother Wally ride into town and stop by the bike shop where Beaver gazes at the shiny red bike in the window. He wanted it so much. Just then, Wally's conniving and sweet-talking friend Eddie Haskell came by and told Beaver the way to get something was to suck up to your parents like maybe joining the football team and then quitting once you got what you desired so when Ward got home that evening, Beaver announced that he would join the football team, only he soon learned that it isn't as easy as it looked but soon Beaver's birthday came. He got all sorts of cool gifts including a computer from Aunt Martha, but from Ward and June, Beaver got the bike he wanted! He was so thrilled! One afternoon, he, Wally and Eddie rode to the malt shop after school where Eddie planned to charm a girl, Karen, that he had a crush on. Wally went in with him and Beaver stayed with his bike. Just then a big kid came by and showed Beaver come cool tricks on his bike, then to Beaver's surprise, he rode off on Beaver's bike! He tried to chase him but it did no good. Wally and Beaver were sure Ward would blow his top so when they finally told him, he was quite disappointed in Beaver then he chastised Wally for not looking out for his brother which he later took out on Beaver and the two get into a fight, causing the computer to fall out the window. Karen was having a boy-girl party and invited Wally. She invited Eddie too, reluctantly. The party was a blast. No girl wanted to kiss poor Eddie, but Wally got some action from Karen! Beaver wasn't enjoying the football team and wanted to quit but Ward wouldn't have it. When Beaver's teacher, Miss Landers, offered to stay after school and help Beaver when he began falling behind, Beaver jumped at the opportunity to help him avoid football. Wally and Karen go ice skating that night and Eddie and Beaver follow and spy on them. Karen meets with an old friend, Kyle and the two leave together. Wally left distraught and ran into Beaver and Eddie. Kyle was friends with the bully who stole Beaver's bike and when Wally, Eddie and Beaver saw him, they gave chase but he gave them the slip. Literally. He dumped a bunch of fish in their paths. To make matters worse, the next day Beaver and his friend Larry saw Kyle and the bike thief and he wanted Beaver to settle a bet. Kyle thought that the giant coffee cup atop a coffee shop had real coffee in it and his friend thought it was a machine so they asked Beaver to climb up there and see which it was. If he did it, he would get his bike back so Beaver climbed to the top of the coffee shop and peered in. Suddenly he fell into the cup and couldn't get out. The two creeps left while Larry went to get the cops. Ward soon found out and climbed into the coffee cup with Beaver and the two had a heart-to-heart talk. Beaver decided to go back to the football team and helped his team win the big game! He saw the bike thief with the bike at the fair and gave chase. Kyle tripped Beaver but Wally shoved him into a vat of fudge. As for the bike thief, a quick thinking Beaver slammed him into a pie judging table. So in the end, Beaver got his bike back and Wally got his girl back and everyone was happy. A pretty good film. Great family entertainment! Christopher McDonald is Ward, Janine Turner is June, Erik Von Detten is Wally and Cameron Finley as the Beaver and he was exceptionally good in his part if I do say so myself! Watch for cameos by the original June, Barbara Billingsley as Aunt Martha, and the original Eddie, Ken Osmond as Eddie's dad! So if you're a fan of the '50s TV series or you're not, I recommend Leave it to Beaver! -

    As weird as this may sound it's true. I just end up watching LEAVE IT TO BEAVER every time it's on. Even though it's pretty dumb, there's just a charm the film has that I can't help but notice every time it's on the Disney channel. It's fun for the whole family, and worth seeing. I'm not sure why though. 3/5 stars
