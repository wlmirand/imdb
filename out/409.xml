    A movie with a important underlying outlook on life. This really comes out with a touching performance that is sad and enlightening at the same time. The way he is able to change from a fate of hopelessness that subjects him to a early death. It really takes a extraordinary actor to accomplish what he was able to portray in this movie. When you have a fate that we are destined to agonize over, there is always hope that burns in all our hearts. We need to choose what we do with the precious time we are given. With Jack (Robin Williams) his time is more cherished. Although with the sadness and despair that will be caused, we can always have a chance to make the best of our time. When we are faced with this tragedy we need to make sure we value the small things, like friendships and love so we can escape any dark futures. This funny and sincere more shows important dialogues and a message that makes this a special movie. Jack has a disorder that makes him grow for times faster then a normal person, his brain behaves the same as a child. Having a role as this is very challenging and Robin does well playing it. Jacks parents are afraid of how his classmates will treat him so they home school him. When there is a scene with a great and positive moment from Bill Cosby's character, they decide to put him in school where he makes great friends along with some difficulties. After he makes friends life is going well for him when he has a heartbreak he clutches his heart almost like a heart attack, as we find out his time is running out. He gets to go back to school and seven years later he is 17 which in his time is 68. This was a great Robin Williams movie entertaining and moving. If you enjoy comedy even Robin Williams this should be a must see on your list.

    When you've won as many Oscars as Francis Ford Coppola has, Jack is not the type of movie that you make. Coppola, whose resume includes The Godfather trilogy, Apocalypse Now, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Peggy Sue Got Married, has won five Oscars, and if you look back to all of those films mentioned,it just proves what a gift he has. But God only knows what went through his mind as he directed Jack. Robin Williams plays the title character, a 10 year old who ages 4 times faster than usual, so he looks like Robin Williams. After being home schooled for 10 years, he finally persuades his parents (Diane Lane and Brain Kerwin) to let him go to public school. Of course, he is judged, but with the help of his teacher (Jennifer Lopez), he tries to win them over. It seems as if after Coppola directed Apocalypse Now, he had become possessed by some sort of film demon. Sure, he directed good movies after that, but for every Peggy Sue Got Married there was The Outsiders. Watching this movie feels like you're waiting for a flight that is never going to arrive. Clocking in at nearly 2 hours, Jack is a monstrosity of many proportions. All of the actors here feel trapped. The premise alone is sort of creepy, and you can't tell whether or not this movie is trying to be My Left Foot or a Robin Williams comedy. Williams has way too much talent for this. It's a movie that never really lets him spread his wings. He's bored, and we are too. Also, the movie is just plain gross, and in ways that I would rather not release to others. The dialogue is head-achingly corny, and it doesn't stop. There's also no real purpose here. all this movie wants from us is to feel pity for this guy. I feel pity for him all right... but his name is not Jack. His name is Robin, and I also pity someone named Diane, someone named Jennifer, and someone named Francis at the root of all evil. This is one of the strangest, nastiest, and flat out worst movies of all time. F

    If you have ever experienced the paranoia that comes with the dread of fitting in with others, you may identify with the adolescent character that actor Robin Williams plays in "Godfather" director Francis Ford Coppola's imaginative comedy drama "Jack," a sensitive, sweet-spirited, feel-good film that costars Bill Cosby. Don't let the inevitable comparisons with the brilliant Tom Hanks comedy "Big" diminish your opinion about "Jack." Both movies manage to complement each other without competing in their chronicles about growing up. Neither should you let the memories of Robin Williams as a rollicking Brunhilda in "Mrs. Doubtfire" mislead you into thinking that "Jack" is all clown-beat without being downbeat. "Jack" opens during a Halloween costume party. Karen Powell (Diana Lane of "Streets of Fire") has not been pregnant long enough to attend child-birth classes when she feels her future son kicking to get out. Brian Powell (Brian Kerwin) and a couple of their friends, all variously garbed as the Tin Man, a cigarette pack and a champagne class, rush Karen (dressed as a witch) off to the hospital. In the delivery room, everybody tries to convince Karen that it's a false alert until the doctor realizes that she is indeed about to give birth to a premature baby. Later, during a check-up, the Powells learn that Jack's inner clock ticks considerably faster than most clocks. The doctors guardedly explain to them that a condition that accelerates his growth afflicts poor Jack. When Jack reaches age 10, the doctors predict that he will resemble a 40-year old man. Otherwise, Jack is healthy and normal. Not! The Powells grow so protective of their cute baby with his beanstalk growth that they imprison him in his turret-like room. They hire tutor Lawrence Woodruff (Bill Cosby in a minor but masterly performance) to tech him. Brian and Karen keep Jack out of public school because they fear he would suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous ridicule. Woodruff disagrees with them. He thinks that Jack should not be deprived of the experience of going to school with kids his own age. Jack feels the same way. He chomps at the bit to attend public school. Reluctantly, Brian and Karen cave and escort Jack to school. So off goes Jackall twinkle-eyedto school. And not just any school, but an elementary school named after novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne. Initially, Jack's towering hirsute presence makes him an outcast. Although the physical act of growing up may come easily to Jack, mastering the mental feats of maturation pose more difficulties to him than he could ever imagine. Jack experiences many of the problems that the Great Dane who hung out with the dachshunds encountered in the 1966 Dean Jones farce "The Ugly Dachshund." Just when you think that Robin Williams has worn out his welcome, the inventive actor manages to plumb new depths. His funny yet restrained performance of a 10-year old trapped in a the body of a 40-year old negotiating the obstacle course of adolescence probably would garner him an Oscar, but his Jack emerges as more of a character than a clown. Although "Jack" qualifies as a comedy, the film contains enough sharp dramatic turns to hoist it above similar slickly produced but synthetic kid ventures such as Dudley Moore's "Like Father, Like Son" and the 1988 Judge Reinhold movie "Vice Versa." In "Jack," Williams radiates best during those scenes when he discovers that life's silver the silver lining can just as easily turn to lead. A particularly poignant moment occurs when Jack struggles to persuade his fifth-grade teacher, Ms. Marquez (winningly enacted by Jennifer Lopez), to escort him to the school dance. Not only does Jack have a crush on her, but she is also the only person with whom he could dance who was his own height. When she reluctantly rejects him, prepare to be plunged headlong into your handkerchief. Although Robin Williams deserves praise for his charismatic performance, the real genius looking over the shoulders of "Jack" is Coppola. Several critics have savaged Coppola for helming what in their hallowed estimation is a far cry from "Apocalypse Now." Obviously, they forgot that Coppola cranked out his first comedy in 1966 with "You're A Big Boy Now," so the famous director is no stranger to high jinks. Coppola gives "Jack" an artsy-fartsy sophistication. Whenever possible, he presents the adult world from Jack's perspective, so we get a number of interesting shots, such as the instant of birth, the view from a turret window onto the outside world, or a glimpse through a slot in a box at Jack's mother trying to get him to come out and play. Coppola has cleverly crafted every minute of "Jack" for maximum dramatic impact. Coppola fleshes out Williams' superb performance with product references that enhance the juvenile facets of Jack's character. The blinking lights on the heels of Jack's sneakers, for example, are a splendid touch to Williams' shenanigans. Another amusing episode has Williams begging his parents to let him bed down with them, then asking if his "Stimpy" doll can crowd in with them. As Jack's overprotective mom, Diana Lane excels in showing the struggles to deal with a person as fragile as Jack. Of course, Bill Cosby strikes high notes every time he appears without having to steal scenes from Williams. Fran Drescher exudes sexuality but provides more than window dressing as party girl Dolores Durante, the mother of Jack's closest school yard chum, Louis (Adam Zolotin). The bickering duo of girls who harass Jack on the playground are fun to watch, too. "Jack" boasts many wonderful touches. Some touches you may overlook because Coppola so skillfully and invisibly integrates them without appreciating their underlying significance. If the concluding scenes of "Jack" do not move you to tears, you're obviously watching the wrong kind of movie. Ultimately, "Jack" proves that there are more important things in life than size.

    I used to love this movie as a child, i can remember renting it weekly at my local video shop. the fart scene in the cubby house always had me in stitches. now as a 22 year old, having sadly forgotten about this underrated gem, until i remembered it a few weeks ago and hunted for it on DVD. when hunting for some old videos i found a copy that must have somehow snuck into my video collection and i dusted off the old vcr player sat back and watched it. i laughed, i cried, i remembered my childhood. i think what Francis Ford Copella has done is an amazing achievement, it is truly hard for a movie to achieve what Jack does, it's fun for children, and adults who are young at heart. but it also reached me on another level, it reached me on a level of meaning and emotion, it taught me life is short, in a way no other movie has reached me.

    Watching this movie is absolutely stunning. Not because it is a good movie, but because this immature, idiotic, brainless mess was directed by the same person who directed The Godfather! How does that happen? How can a man have such an incredible run in the 70's, making literally some of the greatest movies ever made, and then go on to make Jack? But I digress. Jack is the story about a boy who ages four times faster than a normal human being. He lives in his house with his two loving parents and his tutor, played by Bill Cosby. Why Cosby subjected himself to this schlock I don't know, but that's beside the point. After ten years of seclusion Jack realizes he wants to go to school, so his parents reluctantly enter him in public school. It seems the smarter thing to do would have been to put him in private school, but let's face it, there's nothing smart about this film. But anyways, Jack begins to make friends and meet all kinds of new people, his age and older. What is supposed to be a heartwarming tale of friendship and acceptance really just turns into a silly and jumbled mess with a boring story fueled by a poor script. You know your film is set for disaster when it starts with a dumb premise. There's only so many places a premise like this can go, but the film doesn't even make the most out of what little it has to work with. Every situation is predictable, and nothing elicits a laugh, at least not from me. I could blame this on Jack being a kids film, but the problem is, Jack is not a kids film. It's rated PG-13 and has all sorts of innuendo and adult situations. Jack gets his friends adult magazines and they sit in their treehouse talking about erections and women. So I feel like the humor here is supposed to be adult, but I didn't enjoy it at all, but I hardly think a child would either. It's just too stupid and ridiculous to the point where instead of anything being funny, it is all just sort of awkward and forced. By the end of this film it takes a turn towards the serious, but fails just as much here as it did when it was a comedy. This is probably due to the fact that I just had no interest in the characters or their story by this point in the film. Everything that had happened up to this point was just so pathetic and forgettable that it built a wall between me and the films emotion. Maybe under different circumstances in which the first half of the film had been engaging, the last half would have really pulled at me heart strings. But in this case it didn't at all and I could have cared less what happened to Jack and all his friends. Nothing about this film seems real. It all feels like actors delivering a mediocre script, all the while wondering what the hell they are doing on this set for such a bad movie. Then they remember, oh right! I'm getting to work with the genius behind The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. Only now he's lost his mind and is directing horrible dramadies. Watching a film like this just makes you want to go back and watch the Coppola classics, just to remind yourself that this man is a genius. And that's the thing. With so many incredible films under his belt, Jack can be easily forgotten and we can all pretend like it never happened. Hell, Coppola could direct Smokey and the Bandit sequels for the rest of his life, but he would still go down in history as one of the greatest directors who ever lived. But even if you take Coppola out of the equation, Jack is still an awful movie with no motivation and no heart behind it. Spare yourself the two hours and avoid this film at all costs.

    I do not think Jack is as bad as it is made out to be, but it is one of my least favourite Francis Ford Coppola films. The film is overlong, has some weak spots in the script and drags a bit at times. However, it does look decent, with the cinematography and sceneries nicely done, the soundtrack is credible enough, Coppola directs admirably and I loved the concept(reminded me a bit of Big). Robin Williams also gives an exuberant turn in the lead, while Diane Lane and Brian Kerwin are subtle and Jennifer Lopez is surprisingly sweet and believable. Overall, Jack is a decent enough film. It is lacking a bit and one of the weaker films of a truly great director, but it is worth seeing for Williams and the concept. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    I watched ten minutes of this and felt pretty sick. There have been documentaries on this subject on television of real children that are actually interesting, sad and happy by turns in the real world. What got into people to make such a thing is beyond me. This is the worst kind of sentimental mawkishness and a thoroughly sick and bad idea irrespective of the intentions. I think if we can have a film about marching penguins, or more seriously the columbine massacres shown at the cinema its about time we were able to face an actual documentary about a child with this condition instead of this horrible, horrible proxy for one. By the way... The central conceit that children with this syndrome look like Robin Williams is so very far off beam. In actuality they are the same height as normal children with an adult facial appearance and other attributes. (I know from a made for TV documentary that did this whole thing PROPERLY) This film is a total travesty. Only in America! If you are a buyer for a TV company: I am sure you can find the documentary I watched instead if you really try. Show that instead.

    This movie is better than The Shawshank Redemption and The Godfather combined. It really does belong in the Top 250, because I think this is the best movie I have ever watched. It combines heartfelt drama with childish comedy. It's about a guy named Jack with a disorder that makes him look 4 times his actual age. The acting is phenomenal, and the movie is just great overall and makes you think about life. It is an imaginative, wonderful movie that I recommend to anyone and everyone, if your 6 years old or 60 years old. Don't listen to the low rating. Watch this incredible movie no matter what any critic says. 10/10 or: A+

    A curiosity coming from Francis Ford Coppola (who also co-produced for Zoetrope) has pregnant Diane Lane going into labor after only two months, delivering a healthy-seeming baby boy (when she pleads to her husband in the delivery room, "It's too soon!", it's rather an understatement). Doctors have never seen another child like this, yet quickly determine the boy has an internal clock which is ahead of itself by four times the average rate, meaning that when Jack is ten-years old he'll look like a man of forty. This peculiar movie gimmick aside, what we really have here is Robin Williams back in grade school. Although this may sound perfectly inexcusable, not to mention somewhat derivative, it isn't a silly movie (at least, not at its core) and has good acting. Williams manages to hold back a bit from his usual barrage of vocal effects and facial expressions, and a few of his scenes are peddled quite softly (as they were in "Awakenings"). Also quite fine are Bill Cosby as Jack's initial tutor and Jennifer Lopez as his schoolteacher. The little boys are way over-the-top, and some of their gross-out talk is just stupid (they hole up in a tree house, equipped with TV, looking at nudie magazines--probably an attempt to mirror grown-ups but it plays sour). Oddly, Coppola can't stop himself from ultimately tugging at the old heartstrings, and not just once but for an entire sequence and an epilogue! I could have done without the "seven years later" bit, but for the most part this is a warm family comedy with a bigger heart than it knows what to do with. ** from ****

    The director of epics such as The Godfather, Apocalypse Now and The Conversation has made another wonderful film, just like the aforementioned. Robin Williams is fabulous as the eponymous character, and his Jack has echoes of Martin Sheen in Apocalypse, Brando in Godfather and Hackman in Conversation. All these characters are in a deep, intellectual soul-searching mission, and Williams delivers a wonderfully nuanced performance, as the lonely boy who has to deal with manhood all too soon. Funny that Coppola keeps talking about how Hollywood is just about money, but then he makes lovely films like Jack, The Rainmaker or Youth without Youth. Way to go, Francis. See you next time.

Whenever possible, he presents the adult world from Jack's perspective, so we get a number of interesting shots, such as the instant of birth, the view from a turret window onto the outside world, or a glimpse through a slot in a box at Jack's mother trying to get him to come out and play. Coppola has cleverly crafted every minute of "Jack" for maximum dramatic impact. Coppola fleshes out Williams' superb performance with product references that enhance the juvenile facets of Jack's character. The blinking lights on the heels of Jack's sneakers, for example, are a splendid touch to Williams' shenanigans. Another amusing episode has Williams begging his parents to let him bed down with them, then asking if his "Stimpy" doll can crowd in with them. As Jack's overprotective mom, Diana Lane excels in showing the struggles to deal with a person as fragile as Jack. Of course, Bill Cosby strikes high notes every time he appears without having to steal scenes from Williams. Fran Drescher exudes sexuality but provides more than window dressing as party girl Dolores Durante, the mother of Jack's closest school yard chum, Louis (Adam Zolotin). The bickering duo of girls who harass Jack on the playground are fun to watch, too. "Jack" boasts many wonderful touches. Some touches you may overlook because Coppola so skillfully and invisibly integrates them without appreciating their underlying significance. If the concluding scenes of "Jack" do not move you to tears, you're obviously watching the wrong kind of movie. Ultimately, "Jack" proves that there are more important things in life than size.

    I used to love this movie as a child, i can remember renting it weekly at my local video shop. the fart scene in the cubby house always had me in stitches. now as a 22 year old, having sadly forgotten about this underrated gem, until i remembered it a few weeks ago and hunted for it on DVD. when hunting for some old videos i found a copy that must have somehow snuck into my video collection and i dusted off the old vcr player sat back and watched it. i laughed, i cried, i remembered my childhood. i think what Francis Ford Copella has done is an amazing achievement, it is truly hard for a movie to achieve what Jack does, it's fun for children, and adults who are young at heart. but it also reached me on another level, it reached me on a level of meaning and emotion, it taught me life is short, in a way no other movie has reached me.

    Watching this movie is absolutely stunning. Not because it is a good movie, but because this immature, idiotic, brainless mess was directed by the same person who directed The Godfather! How does that happen? How can a man have such an incredible run in the 70's, making literally some of the greatest movies ever made, and then go on to make Jack? But I digress. Jack is the story about a boy who ages four times faster than a normal human being. He lives in his house with his two loving parents and his tutor, played by Bill Cosby. Why Cosby subjected himself to this schlock I don't know, but that's beside the point. After ten years of seclusion Jack realizes he wants to go to school, so his parents reluctantly enter him in public school. It seems the smarter thing to do would have been to put him in private school, but let's face it, there's nothing smart about this film. But anyways, Jack begins to make friends and meet all kinds of new people, his age and older. What is supposed to be a heartwarming tale of friendship and acceptance really just turns into a silly and jumbled mess with a boring story fueled by a poor script. You know your film is set for disaster when it starts with a dumb premise. There's only so many places a premise like this can go, but the film doesn't even make the most out of what little it has to work with. Every situation is predictable, and nothing elicits a laugh, at least not from me. I could blame this on Jack being a kids film, but the problem is, Jack is not a kids film. It's rated PG-13 and has all sorts of innuendo and adult situations. Jack gets his friends adult magazines and they sit in their treehouse talking about erections and women. So I feel like the humor here is supposed to be adult, but I didn't enjoy it at all, but I hardly think a child would either. It's just too stupid and ridiculous to the point where instead of anything being funny, it is all just sort of awkward and forced. By the end of this film it takes a turn towards the serious, but fails just as much here as it did when it was a comedy. This is probably due to the fact that I just had no interest in the characters or their story by this point in the film. Everything that had happened up to this point was just so pathetic and forgettable that it built a wall between me and the films emotion. Maybe under different circumstances in which the first half of the film had been engaging, the last half would have really pulled at me heart strings. But in this case it didn't at all and I could have cared less what happened to Jack and all his friends. Nothing about this film seems real. It all feels like actors delivering a mediocre script, all the while wondering what the hell they are doing on this set for such a bad movie. Then they remember, oh right! I'm getting to work with the genius behind The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. Only now he's lost his mind and is directing horrible dramadies. Watching a film like this just makes you want to go back and watch the Coppola classics, just to remind yourself that this man is a genius. And that's the thing. With so many incredible films under his belt, Jack can be easily forgotten and we can all pretend like it never happened. Hell, Coppola could direct Smokey and the Bandit sequels for the rest of his life, but he would still go down in history as one of the greatest directors who ever lived. But even if you take Coppola out of the equation, Jack is still an awful movie with no motivation and no heart behind it. Spare yourself the two hours and avoid this film at all costs.

    I do not think Jack is as bad as it is made out to be, but it is one of my least favourite Francis Ford Coppola films. The film is overlong, has some weak spots in the script and drags a bit at times. However, it does look decent, with the cinematography and sceneries nicely done, the soundtrack is credible enough, Coppola directs admirably and I loved the concept(reminded me a bit of Big). Robin Williams also gives an exuberant turn in the lead, while Diane Lane and Brian Kerwin are subtle and Jennifer Lopez is surprisingly sweet and believable. Overall, Jack is a decent enough film. It is lacking a bit and one of the weaker films of a truly great director, but it is worth seeing for Williams and the concept. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    I watched ten minutes of this and felt pretty sick. There have been documentaries on this subject on television of real children that are actually interesting, sad and happy by turns in the real world. What got into people to make such a thing is beyond me. This is the worst kind of sentimental mawkishness and a thoroughly sick and bad idea irrespective of the intentions. I think if we can have a film about marching penguins, or more seriously the columbine massacres shown at the cinema its about time we were able to face an actual documentary about a child with this condition instead of this horrible, horrible proxy for one. By the way... The central conceit that children with this syndrome look like Robin Williams is so very far off beam. In actuality they are the same height as normal children with an adult facial appearance and other attributes. (I know from a made for TV documentary that did this whole thing PROPERLY) This film is a total travesty. Only in America! If you are a buyer for a TV company: I am sure you can find the documentary I watched instead if you really try. Show that instead.

    This movie is better than The Shawshank Redemption and The Godfather combined. It really does belong in the Top 250, because I think this is the best movie I have ever watched. It combines heartfelt drama with childish comedy. It's about a guy named Jack with a disorder that makes him look 4 times his actual age. The acting is phenomenal, and the movie is just great overall and makes you think about life. It is an imaginative, wonderful movie that I recommend to anyone and everyone, if your 6 years old or 60 years old. Don't listen to the low rating. Watch this incredible movie no matter what any critic says. 10/10 or: A+

    A curiosity coming from Francis Ford Coppola (who also co-produced for Zoetrope) has pregnant Diane Lane going into labor after only two months, delivering a healthy-seeming baby boy (when she pleads to her husband in the delivery room, "It's too soon!", it's rather an understatement). Doctors have never seen another child like this, yet quickly determine the boy has an internal clock which is ahead of itself by four times the average rate, meaning that when Jack is ten-years old he'll look like a man of forty. This peculiar movie gimmick aside, what we really have here is Robin Williams back in grade school. Although this may sound perfectly inexcusable, not to mention somewhat derivative, it isn't a silly movie (at least, not at its core) and has good acting. Williams manages to hold back a bit from his usual barrage of vocal effects and facial expressions, and a few of his scenes are peddled quite softly (as they were in "Awakenings"). Also quite fine are Bill Cosby as Jack's initial tutor and Jennifer Lopez as his schoolteacher. The little boys are way over-the-top, and some of their gross-out talk is just stupid (they hole up in a tree house, equipped with TV, looking at nudie magazines--probably an attempt to mirror grown-ups but it plays sour). Oddly, Coppola can't stop himself from ultimately tugging at the old heartstrings, and not just once but for an entire sequence and an epilogue! I could have done without the "seven years later" bit, but for the most part this is a warm family comedy with a bigger heart than it knows what to do with. ** from ****

    The director of epics such as The Godfather, Apocalypse Now and The Conversation has made another wonderful film, just like the aforementioned. Robin Williams is fabulous as the eponymous character, and his Jack has echoes of Martin Sheen in Apocalypse, Brando in Godfather and Hackman in Conversation. All these characters are in a deep, intellectual soul-searching mission, and Williams delivers a wonderfully nuanced performance, as the lonely boy who has to deal with manhood all too soon. Funny that Coppola keeps talking about how Hollywood is just about money, but then he makes lovely films like Jack, The Rainmaker or Youth without Youth. Way to go, Francis. See you next time.

    A movie with a important underlying outlook on life. This really comes out with a touching performance that is sad and enlightening at the same time. The way he is able to change from a fate of hopelessness that subjects him to a early death. It really takes a extraordinary actor to accomplish what he was able to portray in this movie. When you have a fate that we are destined to agonize over, there is always hope that burns in all our hearts. We need to choose what we do with the precious time we are given. With Jack (Robin Williams) his time is more cherished. Although with the sadness and despair that will be caused, we can always have a chance to make the best of our time. When we are faced with this tragedy we need to make sure we value the small things, like friendships and love so we can escape any dark futures. This funny and sincere more shows important dialogues and a message that makes this a special movie. Jack has a disorder that makes him grow for times faster then a normal person, his brain behaves the same as a child. Having a role as this is very challenging and Robin does well playing it. Jacks parents are afraid of how his classmates will treat him so they home school him. When there is a scene with a great and positive moment from Bill Cosby's character, they decide to put him in school where he makes great friends along with some difficulties. After he makes friends life is going well for him when he has a heartbreak he clutches his heart almost like a heart attack, as we find out his time is running out. He gets to go back to school and seven years later he is 17 which in his time is 68. This was a great Robin Williams movie entertaining and moving. If you enjoy comedy even Robin Williams this should be a must see on your list.

    When you've won as many Oscars as Francis Ford Coppola has, Jack is not the type of movie that you make. Coppola, whose resume includes The Godfather trilogy, Apocalypse Now, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Peggy Sue Got Married, has won five Oscars, and if you look back to all of those films mentioned,it just proves what a gift he has. But God only knows what went through his mind as he directed Jack. Robin Williams plays the title character, a 10 year old who ages 4 times faster than usual, so he looks like Robin Williams. After being home schooled for 10 years, he finally persuades his parents (Diane Lane and Brain Kerwin) to let him go to public school. Of course, he is judged, but with the help of his teacher (Jennifer Lopez), he tries to win them over. It seems as if after Coppola directed Apocalypse Now, he had become possessed by some sort of film demon. Sure, he directed good movies after that, but for every Peggy Sue Got Married there was The Outsiders. Watching this movie feels like you're waiting for a flight that is never going to arrive. Clocking in at nearly 2 hours, Jack is a monstrosity of many proportions. All of the actors here feel trapped. The premise alone is sort of creepy, and you can't tell whether or not this movie is trying to be My Left Foot or a Robin Williams comedy. Williams has way too much talent for this. It's a movie that never really lets him spread his wings. He's bored, and we are too. Also, the movie is just plain gross, and in ways that I would rather not release to others. The dialogue is head-achingly corny, and it doesn't stop. There's also no real purpose here. all this movie wants from us is to feel pity for this guy. I feel pity for him all right... but his name is not Jack. His name is Robin, and I also pity someone named Diane, someone named Jennifer, and someone named Francis at the root of all evil. This is one of the strangest, nastiest, and flat out worst movies of all time. F

    If you have ever experienced the paranoia that comes with the dread of fitting in with others, you may identify with the adolescent character that actor Robin Williams plays in "Godfather" director Francis Ford Coppola's imaginative comedy drama "Jack," a sensitive, sweet-spirited, feel-good film that costars Bill Cosby. Don't let the inevitable comparisons with the brilliant Tom Hanks comedy "Big" diminish your opinion about "Jack." Both movies manage to complement each other without competing in their chronicles about growing up. Neither should you let the memories of Robin Williams as a rollicking Brunhilda in "Mrs. Doubtfire" mislead you into thinking that "Jack" is all clown-beat without being downbeat. "Jack" opens during a Halloween costume party. Karen Powell (Diana Lane of "Streets of Fire") has not been pregnant long enough to attend child-birth classes when she feels her future son kicking to get out. Brian Powell (Brian Kerwin) and a couple of their friends, all variously garbed as the Tin Man, a cigarette pack and a champagne class, rush Karen (dressed as a witch) off to the hospital. In the delivery room, everybody tries to convince Karen that it's a false alert until the doctor realizes that she is indeed about to give birth to a premature baby. Later, during a check-up, the Powells learn that Jack's inner clock ticks considerably faster than most clocks. The doctors guardedly explain to them that a condition that accelerates his growth afflicts poor Jack. When Jack reaches age 10, the doctors predict that he will resemble a 40-year old man. Otherwise, Jack is healthy and normal. Not! The Powells grow so protective of their cute baby with his beanstalk growth that they imprison him in his turret-like room. They hire tutor Lawrence Woodruff (Bill Cosby in a minor but masterly performance) to tech him. Brian and Karen keep Jack out of public school because they fear he would suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous ridicule. Woodruff disagrees with them. He thinks that Jack should not be deprived of the experience of going to school with kids his own age. Jack feels the same way. He chomps at the bit to attend public school. Reluctantly, Brian and Karen cave and escort Jack to school. So off goes Jackall twinkle-eyedto school. And not just any school, but an elementary school named after novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne. Initially, Jack's towering hirsute presence makes him an outcast. Although the physical act of growing up may come easily to Jack, mastering the mental feats of maturation pose more difficulties to him than he could ever imagine. Jack experiences many of the problems that the Great Dane who hung out with the dachshunds encountered in the 1966 Dean Jones farce "The Ugly Dachshund." Just when you think that Robin Williams has worn out his welcome, the inventive actor manages to plumb new depths. His funny yet restrained performance of a 10-year old trapped in a the body of a 40-year old negotiating the obstacle course of adolescence probably would garner him an Oscar, but his Jack emerges as more of a character than a clown. Although "Jack" qualifies as a comedy, the film contains enough sharp dramatic turns to hoist it above similar slickly produced but synthetic kid ventures such as Dudley Moore's "Like Father, Like Son" and the 1988 Judge Reinhold movie "Vice Versa." In "Jack," Williams radiates best during those scenes when he discovers that life's silver the silver lining can just as easily turn to lead. A particularly poignant moment occurs when Jack struggles to persuade his fifth-grade teacher, Ms. Marquez (winningly enacted by Jennifer Lopez), to escort him to the school dance. Not only does Jack have a crush on her, but she is also the only person with whom he could dance who was his own height. When she reluctantly rejects him, prepare to be plunged headlong into your handkerchief. Although Robin Williams deserves praise for his charismatic performance, the real genius looking over the shoulders of "Jack" is Coppola. Several critics have savaged Coppola for helming what in their hallowed estimation is a far cry from "Apocalypse Now." Obviously, they forgot that Coppola cranked out his first comedy in 1966 with "You're A Big Boy Now," so the famous director is no stranger to high jinks. Coppola gives "Jack" an artsy-fartsy sophistication. Whenever possible, he presents the adult world from Jack's perspective, so we get a number of interesting shots, such as the instant of birth, the view from a turret window onto the outside world, or a glimpse through a slot in a box at Jack's mother trying to get him to come out and play.

Coppola fleshes out Williams' superb performance with product references that enhance the juvenile facets of Jack's character. The blinking lights on the heels of Jack's sneakers, for example, are a splendid touch to Williams' shenanigans. Another amusing episode has Williams begging his parents to let him bed down with them, then asking if his "Stimpy" doll can crowd in with them. As Jack's overprotective mom, Diana Lane excels in showing the struggles to deal with a person as fragile as Jack. Of course, Bill Cosby strikes high notes every time he appears without having to steal scenes from Williams. Fran Drescher exudes sexuality but provides more than window dressing as party girl Dolores Durante, the mother of Jack's closest school yard chum, Louis (Adam Zolotin). The bickering duo of girls who harass Jack on the playground are fun to watch, too. "Jack" boasts many wonderful touches. Some touches you may overlook because Coppola so skillfully and invisibly integrates them without appreciating their underlying significance. If the concluding scenes of "Jack" do not move you to tears, you're obviously watching the wrong kind of movie. Ultimately, "Jack" proves that there are more important things in life than size.

Doctors have never seen another child like this, yet quickly determine the boy has an internal clock which is ahead of itself by four times the average rate, meaning that when Jack is ten-years old he'll look like a man of forty. This peculiar movie gimmick aside, what we really have here is Robin Williams back in grade school. Although this may sound perfectly inexcusable, not to mention somewhat derivative, it isn't a silly movie (at least, not at its core) and has good acting. Williams manages to hold back a bit from his usual barrage of vocal effects and facial expressions, and a few of his scenes are peddled quite softly (as they were in "Awakenings"). Also quite fine are Bill Cosby as Jack's initial tutor and Jennifer Lopez as his schoolteacher. The little boys are way over-the-top, and some of their gross-out talk is just stupid (they hole up in a tree house, equipped with TV, looking at nudie magazines--probably an attempt to mirror grown-ups but it plays sour). Oddly, Coppola can't stop himself from ultimately tugging at the old heartstrings, and not just once but for an entire sequence and an epilogue! I could have done without the "seven years later" bit, but for the most part this is a warm family comedy with a bigger heart than it knows what to do with. ** from ****

    The director of epics such as The Godfather, Apocalypse Now and The Conversation has made another wonderful film, just like the aforementioned. Robin Williams is fabulous as the eponymous character, and his Jack has echoes of Martin Sheen in Apocalypse, Brando in Godfather and Hackman in Conversation. All these characters are in a deep, intellectual soul-searching mission, and Williams delivers a wonderfully nuanced performance, as the lonely boy who has to deal with manhood all too soon. Funny that Coppola keeps talking about how Hollywood is just about money, but then he makes lovely films like Jack, The Rainmaker or Youth without Youth. Way to go, Francis. See you next time.

    A movie with a important underlying outlook on life. This really comes out with a touching performance that is sad and enlightening at the same time. The way he is able to change from a fate of hopelessness that subjects him to a early death. It really takes a extraordinary actor to accomplish what he was able to portray in this movie. When you have a fate that we are destined to agonize over, there is always hope that burns in all our hearts. We need to choose what we do with the precious time we are given. With Jack (Robin Williams) his time is more cherished. Although with the sadness and despair that will be caused, we can always have a chance to make the best of our time. When we are faced with this tragedy we need to make sure we value the small things, like friendships and love so we can escape any dark futures. This funny and sincere more shows important dialogues and a message that makes this a special movie. Jack has a disorder that makes him grow for times faster then a normal person, his brain behaves the same as a child. Having a role as this is very challenging and Robin does well playing it. Jacks parents are afraid of how his classmates will treat him so they home school him. When there is a scene with a great and positive moment from Bill Cosby's character, they decide to put him in school where he makes great friends along with some difficulties. After he makes friends life is going well for him when he has a heartbreak he clutches his heart almost like a heart attack, as we find out his time is running out. He gets to go back to school and seven years later he is 17 which in his time is 68. This was a great Robin Williams movie entertaining and moving. If you enjoy comedy even Robin Williams this should be a must see on your list.

    When you've won as many Oscars as Francis Ford Coppola has, Jack is not the type of movie that you make. Coppola, whose resume includes The Godfather trilogy, Apocalypse Now, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Peggy Sue Got Married, has won five Oscars, and if you look back to all of those films mentioned,it just proves what a gift he has. But God only knows what went through his mind as he directed Jack. Robin Williams plays the title character, a 10 year old who ages 4 times faster than usual, so he looks like Robin Williams. After being home schooled for 10 years, he finally persuades his parents (Diane Lane and Brain Kerwin) to let him go to public school. Of course, he is judged, but with the help of his teacher (Jennifer Lopez), he tries to win them over. It seems as if after Coppola directed Apocalypse Now, he had become possessed by some sort of film demon. Sure, he directed good movies after that, but for every Peggy Sue Got Married there was The Outsiders. Watching this movie feels like you're waiting for a flight that is never going to arrive. Clocking in at nearly 2 hours, Jack is a monstrosity of many proportions. All of the actors here feel trapped. The premise alone is sort of creepy, and you can't tell whether or not this movie is trying to be My Left Foot or a Robin Williams comedy. Williams has way too much talent for this. It's a movie that never really lets him spread his wings. He's bored, and we are too. Also, the movie is just plain gross, and in ways that I would rather not release to others. The dialogue is head-achingly corny, and it doesn't stop. There's also no real purpose here. all this movie wants from us is to feel pity for this guy. I feel pity for him all right... but his name is not Jack. His name is Robin, and I also pity someone named Diane, someone named Jennifer, and someone named Francis at the root of all evil. This is one of the strangest, nastiest, and flat out worst movies of all time. F

    If you have ever experienced the paranoia that comes with the dread of fitting in with others, you may identify with the adolescent character that actor Robin Williams plays in "Godfather" director Francis Ford Coppola's imaginative comedy drama "Jack," a sensitive, sweet-spirited, feel-good film that costars Bill Cosby. Don't let the inevitable comparisons with the brilliant Tom Hanks comedy "Big" diminish your opinion about "Jack." Both movies manage to complement each other without competing in their chronicles about growing up. Neither should you let the memories of Robin Williams as a rollicking Brunhilda in "Mrs. Doubtfire" mislead you into thinking that "Jack" is all clown-beat without being downbeat. "Jack" opens during a Halloween costume party. Karen Powell (Diana Lane of "Streets of Fire") has not been pregnant long enough to attend child-birth classes when she feels her future son kicking to get out. Brian Powell (Brian Kerwin) and a couple of their friends, all variously garbed as the Tin Man, a cigarette pack and a champagne class, rush Karen (dressed as a witch) off to the hospital. In the delivery room, everybody tries to convince Karen that it's a false alert until the doctor realizes that she is indeed about to give birth to a premature baby. Later, during a check-up, the Powells learn that Jack's inner clock ticks considerably faster than most clocks. The doctors guardedly explain to them that a condition that accelerates his growth afflicts poor Jack. When Jack reaches age 10, the doctors predict that he will resemble a 40-year old man. Otherwise, Jack is healthy and normal. Not! The Powells grow so protective of their cute baby with his beanstalk growth that they imprison him in his turret-like room. They hire tutor Lawrence Woodruff (Bill Cosby in a minor but masterly performance) to tech him. Brian and Karen keep Jack out of public school because they fear he would suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous ridicule. Woodruff disagrees with them. He thinks that Jack should not be deprived of the experience of going to school with kids his own age. Jack feels the same way. He chomps at the bit to attend public school. Reluctantly, Brian and Karen cave and escort Jack to school. So off goes Jackall twinkle-eyedto school. And not just any school, but an elementary school named after novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne. Initially, Jack's towering hirsute presence makes him an outcast. Although the physical act of growing up may come easily to Jack, mastering the mental feats of maturation pose more difficulties to him than he could ever imagine. Jack experiences many of the problems that the Great Dane who hung out with the dachshunds encountered in the 1966 Dean Jones farce "The Ugly Dachshund." Just when you think that Robin Williams has worn out his welcome, the inventive actor manages to plumb new depths. His funny yet restrained performance of a 10-year old trapped in a the body of a 40-year old negotiating the obstacle course of adolescence probably would garner him an Oscar, but his Jack emerges as more of a character than a clown. Although "Jack" qualifies as a comedy, the film contains enough sharp dramatic turns to hoist it above similar slickly produced but synthetic kid ventures such as Dudley Moore's "Like Father, Like Son" and the 1988 Judge Reinhold movie "Vice Versa." In "Jack," Williams radiates best during those scenes when he discovers that life's silver the silver lining can just as easily turn to lead. A particularly poignant moment occurs when Jack struggles to persuade his fifth-grade teacher, Ms. Marquez (winningly enacted by Jennifer Lopez), to escort him to the school dance. Not only does Jack have a crush on her, but she is also the only person with whom he could dance who was his own height. When she reluctantly rejects him, prepare to be plunged headlong into your handkerchief. Although Robin Williams deserves praise for his charismatic performance, the real genius looking over the shoulders of "Jack" is Coppola. Several critics have savaged Coppola for helming what in their hallowed estimation is a far cry from "Apocalypse Now." Obviously, they forgot that Coppola cranked out his first comedy in 1966 with "You're A Big Boy Now," so the famous director is no stranger to high jinks. Coppola gives "Jack" an artsy-fartsy sophistication. Whenever possible, he presents the adult world from Jack's perspective, so we get a number of interesting shots, such as the instant of birth, the view from a turret window onto the outside world, or a glimpse through a slot in a box at Jack's mother trying to get him to come out and play. Coppola has cleverly crafted every minute of "Jack" for maximum dramatic impact. Coppola fleshes out Williams' superb performance with product references that enhance the juvenile facets of Jack's character. The blinking lights on the heels of Jack's sneakers, for example, are a splendid touch to Williams' shenanigans. Another amusing episode has Williams begging his parents to let him bed down with them, then asking if his "Stimpy" doll can crowd in with them. As Jack's overprotective mom, Diana Lane excels in showing the struggles to deal with a person as fragile as Jack. Of course, Bill Cosby strikes high notes every time he appears without having to steal scenes from Williams. Fran Drescher exudes sexuality but provides more than window dressing as party girl Dolores Durante, the mother of Jack's closest school yard chum, Louis (Adam Zolotin). The bickering duo of girls who harass Jack on the playground are fun to watch, too. "Jack" boasts many wonderful touches. Some touches you may overlook because Coppola so skillfully and invisibly integrates them without appreciating their underlying significance. If the concluding scenes of "Jack" do not move you to tears, you're obviously watching the wrong kind of movie. Ultimately, "Jack" proves that there are more important things in life than size.

    I used to love this movie as a child, i can remember renting it weekly at my local video shop. the fart scene in the cubby house always had me in stitches. now as a 22 year old, having sadly forgotten about this underrated gem, until i remembered it a few weeks ago and hunted for it on DVD. when hunting for some old videos i found a copy that must have somehow snuck into my video collection and i dusted off the old vcr player sat back and watched it. i laughed, i cried, i remembered my childhood. i think what Francis Ford Copella has done is an amazing achievement, it is truly hard for a movie to achieve what Jack does, it's fun for children, and adults who are young at heart. but it also reached me on another level, it reached me on a level of meaning and emotion, it taught me life is short, in a way no other movie has reached me.

    Watching this movie is absolutely stunning. Not because it is a good movie, but because this immature, idiotic, brainless mess was directed by the same person who directed The Godfather! How does that happen? How can a man have such an incredible run in the 70's, making literally some of the greatest movies ever made, and then go on to make Jack? But I digress. Jack is the story about a boy who ages four times faster than a normal human being. He lives in his house with his two loving parents and his tutor, played by Bill Cosby. Why Cosby subjected himself to this schlock I don't know, but that's beside the point. After ten years of seclusion Jack realizes he wants to go to school, so his parents reluctantly enter him in public school. It seems the smarter thing to do would have been to put him in private school, but let's face it, there's nothing smart about this film. But anyways, Jack begins to make friends and meet all kinds of new people, his age and older. What is supposed to be a heartwarming tale of friendship and acceptance really just turns into a silly and jumbled mess with a boring story fueled by a poor script. You know your film is set for disaster when it starts with a dumb premise. There's only so many places a premise like this can go, but the film doesn't even make the most out of what little it has to work with. Every situation is predictable, and nothing elicits a laugh, at least not from me. I could blame this on Jack being a kids film, but the problem is, Jack is not a kids film. It's rated PG-13 and has all sorts of innuendo and adult situations. Jack gets his friends adult magazines and they sit in their treehouse talking about erections and women. So I feel like the humor here is supposed to be adult, but I didn't enjoy it at all, but I hardly think a child would either. It's just too stupid and ridiculous to the point where instead of anything being funny, it is all just sort of awkward and forced. By the end of this film it takes a turn towards the serious, but fails just as much here as it did when it was a comedy. This is probably due to the fact that I just had no interest in the characters or their story by this point in the film. Everything that had happened up to this point was just so pathetic and forgettable that it built a wall between me and the films emotion. Maybe under different circumstances in which the first half of the film had been engaging, the last half would have really pulled at me heart strings. But in this case it didn't at all and I could have cared less what happened to Jack and all his friends. Nothing about this film seems real. It all feels like actors delivering a mediocre script, all the while wondering what the hell they are doing on this set for such a bad movie. Then they remember, oh right! I'm getting to work with the genius behind The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. Only now he's lost his mind and is directing horrible dramadies. Watching a film like this just makes you want to go back and watch the Coppola classics, just to remind yourself that this man is a genius. And that's the thing. With so many incredible films under his belt, Jack can be easily forgotten and we can all pretend like it never happened. Hell, Coppola could direct Smokey and the Bandit sequels for the rest of his life, but he would still go down in history as one of the greatest directors who ever lived. But even if you take Coppola out of the equation, Jack is still an awful movie with no motivation and no heart behind it. Spare yourself the two hours and avoid this film at all costs.

    I do not think Jack is as bad as it is made out to be, but it is one of my least favourite Francis Ford Coppola films. The film is overlong, has some weak spots in the script and drags a bit at times. However, it does look decent, with the cinematography and sceneries nicely done, the soundtrack is credible enough, Coppola directs admirably and I loved the concept(reminded me a bit of Big). Robin Williams also gives an exuberant turn in the lead, while Diane Lane and Brian Kerwin are subtle and Jennifer Lopez is surprisingly sweet and believable. Overall, Jack is a decent enough film. It is lacking a bit and one of the weaker films of a truly great director, but it is worth seeing for Williams and the concept. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    I watched ten minutes of this and felt pretty sick. There have been documentaries on this subject on television of real children that are actually interesting, sad and happy by turns in the real world. What got into people to make such a thing is beyond me. This is the worst kind of sentimental mawkishness and a thoroughly sick and bad idea irrespective of the intentions. I think if we can have a film about marching penguins, or more seriously the columbine massacres shown at the cinema its about time we were able to face an actual documentary about a child with this condition instead of this horrible, horrible proxy for one. By the way... The central conceit that children with this syndrome look like Robin Williams is so very far off beam. In actuality they are the same height as normal children with an adult facial appearance and other attributes. (I know from a made for TV documentary that did this whole thing PROPERLY) This film is a total travesty. Only in America! If you are a buyer for a TV company: I am sure you can find the documentary I watched instead if you really try. Show that instead.

    This movie is better than The Shawshank Redemption and The Godfather combined. It really does belong in the Top 250, because I think this is the best movie I have ever watched. It combines heartfelt drama with childish comedy. It's about a guy named Jack with a disorder that makes him look 4 times his actual age. The acting is phenomenal, and the movie is just great overall and makes you think about life. It is an imaginative, wonderful movie that I recommend to anyone and everyone, if your 6 years old or 60 years old. Don't listen to the low rating. Watch this incredible movie no matter what any critic says. 10/10 or: A+

Obviously, they forgot that Coppola cranked out his first comedy in 1966 with "You're A Big Boy Now," so the famous director is no stranger to high jinks. Coppola gives "Jack" an artsy-fartsy sophistication. Whenever possible, he presents the adult world from Jack's perspective, so we get a number of interesting shots, such as the instant of birth, the view from a turret window onto the outside world, or a glimpse through a slot in a box at Jack's mother trying to get him to come out and play. Coppola has cleverly crafted every minute of "Jack" for maximum dramatic impact. Coppola fleshes out Williams' superb performance with product references that enhance the juvenile facets of Jack's character. The blinking lights on the heels of Jack's sneakers, for example, are a splendid touch to Williams' shenanigans. Another amusing episode has Williams begging his parents to let him bed down with them, then asking if his "Stimpy" doll can crowd in with them. As Jack's overprotective mom, Diana Lane excels in showing the struggles to deal with a person as fragile as Jack. Of course, Bill Cosby strikes high notes every time he appears without having to steal scenes from Williams. Fran Drescher exudes sexuality but provides more than window dressing as party girl Dolores Durante, the mother of Jack's closest school yard chum, Louis (Adam Zolotin). The bickering duo of girls who harass Jack on the playground are fun to watch, too. "Jack" boasts many wonderful touches. Some touches you may overlook because Coppola so skillfully and invisibly integrates them without appreciating their underlying significance. If the concluding scenes of "Jack" do not move you to tears, you're obviously watching the wrong kind of movie. Ultimately, "Jack" proves that there are more important things in life than size.

    I used to love this movie as a child, i can remember renting it weekly at my local video shop. the fart scene in the cubby house always had me in stitches. now as a 22 year old, having sadly forgotten about this underrated gem, until i remembered it a few weeks ago and hunted for it on DVD. when hunting for some old videos i found a copy that must have somehow snuck into my video collection and i dusted off the old vcr player sat back and watched it. i laughed, i cried, i remembered my childhood. i think what Francis Ford Copella has done is an amazing achievement, it is truly hard for a movie to achieve what Jack does, it's fun for children, and adults who are young at heart. but it also reached me on another level, it reached me on a level of meaning and emotion, it taught me life is short, in a way no other movie has reached me.

    Watching this movie is absolutely stunning. Not because it is a good movie, but because this immature, idiotic, brainless mess was directed by the same person who directed The Godfather! How does that happen? How can a man have such an incredible run in the 70's, making literally some of the greatest movies ever made, and then go on to make Jack? But I digress. Jack is the story about a boy who ages four times faster than a normal human being. He lives in his house with his two loving parents and his tutor, played by Bill Cosby. Why Cosby subjected himself to this schlock I don't know, but that's beside the point. After ten years of seclusion Jack realizes he wants to go to school, so his parents reluctantly enter him in public school. It seems the smarter thing to do would have been to put him in private school, but let's face it, there's nothing smart about this film. But anyways, Jack begins to make friends and meet all kinds of new people, his age and older. What is supposed to be a heartwarming tale of friendship and acceptance really just turns into a silly and jumbled mess with a boring story fueled by a poor script. You know your film is set for disaster when it starts with a dumb premise. There's only so many places a premise like this can go, but the film doesn't even make the most out of what little it has to work with. Every situation is predictable, and nothing elicits a laugh, at least not from me. I could blame this on Jack being a kids film, but the problem is, Jack is not a kids film. It's rated PG-13 and has all sorts of innuendo and adult situations. Jack gets his friends adult magazines and they sit in their treehouse talking about erections and women. So I feel like the humor here is supposed to be adult, but I didn't enjoy it at all, but I hardly think a child would either. It's just too stupid and ridiculous to the point where instead of anything being funny, it is all just sort of awkward and forced. By the end of this film it takes a turn towards the serious, but fails just as much here as it did when it was a comedy. This is probably due to the fact that I just had no interest in the characters or their story by this point in the film. Everything that had happened up to this point was just so pathetic and forgettable that it built a wall between me and the films emotion. Maybe under different circumstances in which the first half of the film had been engaging, the last half would have really pulled at me heart strings. But in this case it didn't at all and I could have cared less what happened to Jack and all his friends. Nothing about this film seems real. It all feels like actors delivering a mediocre script, all the while wondering what the hell they are doing on this set for such a bad movie. Then they remember, oh right! I'm getting to work with the genius behind The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. Only now he's lost his mind and is directing horrible dramadies. Watching a film like this just makes you want to go back and watch the Coppola classics, just to remind yourself that this man is a genius. And that's the thing. With so many incredible films under his belt, Jack can be easily forgotten and we can all pretend like it never happened. Hell, Coppola could direct Smokey and the Bandit sequels for the rest of his life, but he would still go down in history as one of the greatest directors who ever lived. But even if you take Coppola out of the equation, Jack is still an awful movie with no motivation and no heart behind it. Spare yourself the two hours and avoid this film at all costs.

    I do not think Jack is as bad as it is made out to be, but it is one of my least favourite Francis Ford Coppola films. The film is overlong, has some weak spots in the script and drags a bit at times. However, it does look decent, with the cinematography and sceneries nicely done, the soundtrack is credible enough, Coppola directs admirably and I loved the concept(reminded me a bit of Big). Robin Williams also gives an exuberant turn in the lead, while Diane Lane and Brian Kerwin are subtle and Jennifer Lopez is surprisingly sweet and believable. Overall, Jack is a decent enough film. It is lacking a bit and one of the weaker films of a truly great director, but it is worth seeing for Williams and the concept. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    I watched ten minutes of this and felt pretty sick. There have been documentaries on this subject on television of real children that are actually interesting, sad and happy by turns in the real world. What got into people to make such a thing is beyond me. This is the worst kind of sentimental mawkishness and a thoroughly sick and bad idea irrespective of the intentions. I think if we can have a film about marching penguins, or more seriously the columbine massacres shown at the cinema its about time we were able to face an actual documentary about a child with this condition instead of this horrible, horrible proxy for one. By the way... The central conceit that children with this syndrome look like Robin Williams is so very far off beam. In actuality they are the same height as normal children with an adult facial appearance and other attributes. (I know from a made for TV documentary that did this whole thing PROPERLY) This film is a total travesty. Only in America! If you are a buyer for a TV company: I am sure you can find the documentary I watched instead if you really try. Show that instead.

    This movie is better than The Shawshank Redemption and The Godfather combined. It really does belong in the Top 250, because I think this is the best movie I have ever watched. It combines heartfelt drama with childish comedy. It's about a guy named Jack with a disorder that makes him look 4 times his actual age. The acting is phenomenal, and the movie is just great overall and makes you think about life. It is an imaginative, wonderful movie that I recommend to anyone and everyone, if your 6 years old or 60 years old. Don't listen to the low rating. Watch this incredible movie no matter what any critic says. 10/10 or: A+

    A curiosity coming from Francis Ford Coppola (who also co-produced for Zoetrope) has pregnant Diane Lane going into labor after only two months, delivering a healthy-seeming baby boy (when she pleads to her husband in the delivery room, "It's too soon!", it's rather an understatement). Doctors have never seen another child like this, yet quickly determine the boy has an internal clock which is ahead of itself by four times the average rate, meaning that when Jack is ten-years old he'll look like a man of forty. This peculiar movie gimmick aside, what we really have here is Robin Williams back in grade school. Although this may sound perfectly inexcusable, not to mention somewhat derivative, it isn't a silly movie (at least, not at its core) and has good acting. Williams manages to hold back a bit from his usual barrage of vocal effects and facial expressions, and a few of his scenes are peddled quite softly (as they were in "Awakenings"). Also quite fine are Bill Cosby as Jack's initial tutor and Jennifer Lopez as his schoolteacher. The little boys are way over-the-top, and some of their gross-out talk is just stupid (they hole up in a tree house, equipped with TV, looking at nudie magazines--probably an attempt to mirror grown-ups but it plays sour). Oddly, Coppola can't stop himself from ultimately tugging at the old heartstrings, and not just once but for an entire sequence and an epilogue! I could have done without the "seven years later" bit, but for the most part this is a warm family comedy with a bigger heart than it knows what to do with. ** from ****

    The director of epics such as The Godfather, Apocalypse Now and The Conversation has made another wonderful film, just like the aforementioned. Robin Williams is fabulous as the eponymous character, and his Jack has echoes of Martin Sheen in Apocalypse, Brando in Godfather and Hackman in Conversation. All these characters are in a deep, intellectual soul-searching mission, and Williams delivers a wonderfully nuanced performance, as the lonely boy who has to deal with manhood all too soon. Funny that Coppola keeps talking about how Hollywood is just about money, but then he makes lovely films like Jack, The Rainmaker or Youth without Youth. Way to go, Francis. See you next time.

    A movie with a important underlying outlook on life. This really comes out with a touching performance that is sad and enlightening at the same time. The way he is able to change from a fate of hopelessness that subjects him to a early death. It really takes a extraordinary actor to accomplish what he was able to portray in this movie. When you have a fate that we are destined to agonize over, there is always hope that burns in all our hearts. We need to choose what we do with the precious time we are given. With Jack (Robin Williams) his time is more cherished. Although with the sadness and despair that will be caused, we can always have a chance to make the best of our time. When we are faced with this tragedy we need to make sure we value the small things, like friendships and love so we can escape any dark futures. This funny and sincere more shows important dialogues and a message that makes this a special movie. Jack has a disorder that makes him grow for times faster then a normal person, his brain behaves the same as a child. Having a role as this is very challenging and Robin does well playing it. Jacks parents are afraid of how his classmates will treat him so they home school him. When there is a scene with a great and positive moment from Bill Cosby's character, they decide to put him in school where he makes great friends along with some difficulties. After he makes friends life is going well for him when he has a heartbreak he clutches his heart almost like a heart attack, as we find out his time is running out. He gets to go back to school and seven years later he is 17 which in his time is 68. This was a great Robin Williams movie entertaining and moving. If you enjoy comedy even Robin Williams this should be a must see on your list.

    When you've won as many Oscars as Francis Ford Coppola has, Jack is not the type of movie that you make. Coppola, whose resume includes The Godfather trilogy, Apocalypse Now, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Peggy Sue Got Married, has won five Oscars, and if you look back to all of those films mentioned,it just proves what a gift he has. But God only knows what went through his mind as he directed Jack. Robin Williams plays the title character, a 10 year old who ages 4 times faster than usual, so he looks like Robin Williams. After being home schooled for 10 years, he finally persuades his parents (Diane Lane and Brain Kerwin) to let him go to public school. Of course, he is judged, but with the help of his teacher (Jennifer Lopez), he tries to win them over. It seems as if after Coppola directed Apocalypse Now, he had become possessed by some sort of film demon. Sure, he directed good movies after that, but for every Peggy Sue Got Married there was The Outsiders. Watching this movie feels like you're waiting for a flight that is never going to arrive. Clocking in at nearly 2 hours, Jack is a monstrosity of many proportions. All of the actors here feel trapped. The premise alone is sort of creepy, and you can't tell whether or not this movie is trying to be My Left Foot or a Robin Williams comedy. Williams has way too much talent for this. It's a movie that never really lets him spread his wings. He's bored, and we are too. Also, the movie is just plain gross, and in ways that I would rather not release to others. The dialogue is head-achingly corny, and it doesn't stop. There's also no real purpose here. all this movie wants from us is to feel pity for this guy. I feel pity for him all right... but his name is not Jack. His name is Robin, and I also pity someone named Diane, someone named Jennifer, and someone named Francis at the root of all evil. This is one of the strangest, nastiest, and flat out worst movies of all time. F

    If you have ever experienced the paranoia that comes with the dread of fitting in with others, you may identify with the adolescent character that actor Robin Williams plays in "Godfather" director Francis Ford Coppola's imaginative comedy drama "Jack," a sensitive, sweet-spirited, feel-good film that costars Bill Cosby. Don't let the inevitable comparisons with the brilliant Tom Hanks comedy "Big" diminish your opinion about "Jack." Both movies manage to complement each other without competing in their chronicles about growing up. Neither should you let the memories of Robin Williams as a rollicking Brunhilda in "Mrs. Doubtfire" mislead you into thinking that "Jack" is all clown-beat without being downbeat. "Jack" opens during a Halloween costume party. Karen Powell (Diana Lane of "Streets of Fire") has not been pregnant long enough to attend child-birth classes when she feels her future son kicking to get out. Brian Powell (Brian Kerwin) and a couple of their friends, all variously garbed as the Tin Man, a cigarette pack and a champagne class, rush Karen (dressed as a witch) off to the hospital. In the delivery room, everybody tries to convince Karen that it's a false alert until the doctor realizes that she is indeed about to give birth to a premature baby. Later, during a check-up, the Powells learn that Jack's inner clock ticks considerably faster than most clocks. The doctors guardedly explain to them that a condition that accelerates his growth afflicts poor Jack. When Jack reaches age 10, the doctors predict that he will resemble a 40-year old man. Otherwise, Jack is healthy and normal. Not! The Powells grow so protective of their cute baby with his beanstalk growth that they imprison him in his turret-like room. They hire tutor Lawrence Woodruff (Bill Cosby in a minor but masterly performance) to tech him. Brian and Karen keep Jack out of public school because they fear he would suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous ridicule. Woodruff disagrees with them. He thinks that Jack should not be deprived of the experience of going to school with kids his own age. Jack feels the same way. He chomps at the bit to attend public school. Reluctantly, Brian and Karen cave and escort Jack to school. So off goes Jackall twinkle-eyedto school. And not just any school, but an elementary school named after novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne. Initially, Jack's towering hirsute presence makes him an outcast. Although the physical act of growing up may come easily to Jack, mastering the mental feats of maturation pose more difficulties to him than he could ever imagine. Jack experiences many of the problems that the Great Dane who hung out with the dachshunds encountered in the 1966 Dean Jones farce "The Ugly Dachshund." Just when you think that Robin Williams has worn out his welcome, the inventive actor manages to plumb new depths. His funny yet restrained performance of a 10-year old trapped in a the body of a 40-year old negotiating the obstacle course of adolescence probably would garner him an Oscar, but his Jack emerges as more of a character than a clown. Although "Jack" qualifies as a comedy, the film contains enough sharp dramatic turns to hoist it above similar slickly produced but synthetic kid ventures such as Dudley Moore's "Like Father, Like Son" and the 1988 Judge Reinhold movie "Vice Versa." In "Jack," Williams radiates best during those scenes when he discovers that life's silver the silver lining can just as easily turn to lead. A particularly poignant moment occurs when Jack struggles to persuade his fifth-grade teacher, Ms. Marquez (winningly enacted by Jennifer Lopez), to escort him to the school dance. Not only does Jack have a crush on her, but she is also the only person with whom he could dance who was his own height. When she reluctantly rejects him, prepare to be plunged headlong into your handkerchief. Although Robin Williams deserves praise for his charismatic performance, the real genius looking over the shoulders of "Jack" is Coppola. Several critics have savaged Coppola for helming what in their hallowed estimation is a far cry from "Apocalypse Now." Obviously, they forgot that Coppola cranked out his first comedy in 1966 with "You're A Big Boy Now," so the famous director is no stranger to high jinks. Coppola gives "Jack" an artsy-fartsy sophistication. Whenever possible, he presents the adult world from Jack's perspective, so we get a number of interesting shots, such as the instant of birth, the view from a turret window onto the outside world, or a glimpse through a slot in a box at Jack's mother trying to get him to come out and play.

Of course, Bill Cosby strikes high notes every time he appears without having to steal scenes from Williams. Fran Drescher exudes sexuality but provides more than window dressing as party girl Dolores Durante, the mother of Jack's closest school yard chum, Louis (Adam Zolotin). The bickering duo of girls who harass Jack on the playground are fun to watch, too. "Jack" boasts many wonderful touches.

If the concluding scenes of "Jack" do not move you to tears, you're obviously watching the wrong kind of movie. Ultimately, "Jack" proves that there are more important things in life than size.

    A curiosity coming from Francis Ford Coppola (who also co-produced for Zoetrope) has pregnant Diane Lane going into labor after only two months, delivering a healthy-seeming baby boy (when she pleads to her husband in the delivery room, "It's too soon!", it's rather an understatement). Doctors have never seen another child like this, yet quickly determine the boy has an internal clock which is ahead of itself by four times the average rate, meaning that when Jack is ten-years old he'll look like a man of forty. This peculiar movie gimmick aside, what we really have here is Robin Williams back in grade school. Although this may sound perfectly inexcusable, not to mention somewhat derivative, it isn't a silly movie (at least, not at its core) and has good acting. Williams manages to hold back a bit from his usual barrage of vocal effects and facial expressions, and a few of his scenes are peddled quite softly (as they were in "Awakenings"). Also quite fine are Bill Cosby as Jack's initial tutor and Jennifer Lopez as his schoolteacher. The little boys are way over-the-top, and some of their gross-out talk is just stupid (they hole up in a tree house, equipped with TV, looking at nudie magazines--probably an attempt to mirror grown-ups but it plays sour). Oddly, Coppola can't stop himself from ultimately tugging at the old heartstrings, and not just once but for an entire sequence and an epilogue! I could have done without the "seven years later" bit, but for the most part this is a warm family comedy with a bigger heart than it knows what to do with. ** from ****

    The director of epics such as The Godfather, Apocalypse Now and The Conversation has made another wonderful film, just like the aforementioned. Robin Williams is fabulous as the eponymous character, and his Jack has echoes of Martin Sheen in Apocalypse, Brando in Godfather and Hackman in Conversation. All these characters are in a deep, intellectual soul-searching mission, and Williams delivers a wonderfully nuanced performance, as the lonely boy who has to deal with manhood all too soon. Funny that Coppola keeps talking about how Hollywood is just about money, but then he makes lovely films like Jack, The Rainmaker or Youth without Youth. Way to go, Francis. See you next time.

    A movie with a important underlying outlook on life. This really comes out with a touching performance that is sad and enlightening at the same time. The way he is able to change from a fate of hopelessness that subjects him to a early death. It really takes a extraordinary actor to accomplish what he was able to portray in this movie. When you have a fate that we are destined to agonize over, there is always hope that burns in all our hearts. We need to choose what we do with the precious time we are given. With Jack (Robin Williams) his time is more cherished. Although with the sadness and despair that will be caused, we can always have a chance to make the best of our time. When we are faced with this tragedy we need to make sure we value the small things, like friendships and love so we can escape any dark futures. This funny and sincere more shows important dialogues and a message that makes this a special movie. Jack has a disorder that makes him grow for times faster then a normal person, his brain behaves the same as a child. Having a role as this is very challenging and Robin does well playing it. Jacks parents are afraid of how his classmates will treat him so they home school him. When there is a scene with a great and positive moment from Bill Cosby's character, they decide to put him in school where he makes great friends along with some difficulties. After he makes friends life is going well for him when he has a heartbreak he clutches his heart almost like a heart attack, as we find out his time is running out. He gets to go back to school and seven years later he is 17 which in his time is 68. This was a great Robin Williams movie entertaining and moving. If you enjoy comedy even Robin Williams this should be a must see on your list.

    When you've won as many Oscars as Francis Ford Coppola has, Jack is not the type of movie that you make. Coppola, whose resume includes The Godfather trilogy, Apocalypse Now, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Peggy Sue Got Married, has won five Oscars, and if you look back to all of those films mentioned,it just proves what a gift he has. But God only knows what went through his mind as he directed Jack. Robin Williams plays the title character, a 10 year old who ages 4 times faster than usual, so he looks like Robin Williams. After being home schooled for 10 years, he finally persuades his parents (Diane Lane and Brain Kerwin) to let him go to public school. Of course, he is judged, but with the help of his teacher (Jennifer Lopez), he tries to win them over. It seems as if after Coppola directed Apocalypse Now, he had become possessed by some sort of film demon. Sure, he directed good movies after that, but for every Peggy Sue Got Married there was The Outsiders. Watching this movie feels like you're waiting for a flight that is never going to arrive. Clocking in at nearly 2 hours, Jack is a monstrosity of many proportions. All of the actors here feel trapped. The premise alone is sort of creepy, and you can't tell whether or not this movie is trying to be My Left Foot or a Robin Williams comedy. Williams has way too much talent for this. It's a movie that never really lets him spread his wings. He's bored, and we are too. Also, the movie is just plain gross, and in ways that I would rather not release to others. The dialogue is head-achingly corny, and it doesn't stop. There's also no real purpose here. all this movie wants from us is to feel pity for this guy. I feel pity for him all right... but his name is not Jack. His name is Robin, and I also pity someone named Diane, someone named Jennifer, and someone named Francis at the root of all evil. This is one of the strangest, nastiest, and flat out worst movies of all time. F

    If you have ever experienced the paranoia that comes with the dread of fitting in with others, you may identify with the adolescent character that actor Robin Williams plays in "Godfather" director Francis Ford Coppola's imaginative comedy drama "Jack," a sensitive, sweet-spirited, feel-good film that costars Bill Cosby. Don't let the inevitable comparisons with the brilliant Tom Hanks comedy "Big" diminish your opinion about "Jack." Both movies manage to complement each other without competing in their chronicles about growing up. Neither should you let the memories of Robin Williams as a rollicking Brunhilda in "Mrs. Doubtfire" mislead you into thinking that "Jack" is all clown-beat without being downbeat. "Jack" opens during a Halloween costume party. Karen Powell (Diana Lane of "Streets of Fire") has not been pregnant long enough to attend child-birth classes when she feels her future son kicking to get out. Brian Powell (Brian Kerwin) and a couple of their friends, all variously garbed as the Tin Man, a cigarette pack and a champagne class, rush Karen (dressed as a witch) off to the hospital. In the delivery room, everybody tries to convince Karen that it's a false alert until the doctor realizes that she is indeed about to give birth to a premature baby. Later, during a check-up, the Powells learn that Jack's inner clock ticks considerably faster than most clocks. The doctors guardedly explain to them that a condition that accelerates his growth afflicts poor Jack. When Jack reaches age 10, the doctors predict that he will resemble a 40-year old man. Otherwise, Jack is healthy and normal. Not! The Powells grow so protective of their cute baby with his beanstalk growth that they imprison him in his turret-like room. They hire tutor Lawrence Woodruff (Bill Cosby in a minor but masterly performance) to tech him. Brian and Karen keep Jack out of public school because they fear he would suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous ridicule. Woodruff disagrees with them. He thinks that Jack should not be deprived of the experience of going to school with kids his own age. Jack feels the same way. He chomps at the bit to attend public school. Reluctantly, Brian and Karen cave and escort Jack to school. So off goes Jackall twinkle-eyedto school. And not just any school, but an elementary school named after novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne. Initially, Jack's towering hirsute presence makes him an outcast. Although the physical act of growing up may come easily to Jack, mastering the mental feats of maturation pose more difficulties to him than he could ever imagine. Jack experiences many of the problems that the Great Dane who hung out with the dachshunds encountered in the 1966 Dean Jones farce "The Ugly Dachshund." Just when you think that Robin Williams has worn out his welcome, the inventive actor manages to plumb new depths. His funny yet restrained performance of a 10-year old trapped in a the body of a 40-year old negotiating the obstacle course of adolescence probably would garner him an Oscar, but his Jack emerges as more of a character than a clown. Although "Jack" qualifies as a comedy, the film contains enough sharp dramatic turns to hoist it above similar slickly produced but synthetic kid ventures such as Dudley Moore's "Like Father, Like Son" and the 1988 Judge Reinhold movie "Vice Versa." In "Jack," Williams radiates best during those scenes when he discovers that life's silver the silver lining can just as easily turn to lead. A particularly poignant moment occurs when Jack struggles to persuade his fifth-grade teacher, Ms. Marquez (winningly enacted by Jennifer Lopez), to escort him to the school dance. Not only does Jack have a crush on her, but she is also the only person with whom he could dance who was his own height. When she reluctantly rejects him, prepare to be plunged headlong into your handkerchief. Although Robin Williams deserves praise for his charismatic performance, the real genius looking over the shoulders of "Jack" is Coppola. Several critics have savaged Coppola for helming what in their hallowed estimation is a far cry from "Apocalypse Now." Obviously, they forgot that Coppola cranked out his first comedy in 1966 with "You're A Big Boy Now," so the famous director is no stranger to high jinks. Coppola gives "Jack" an artsy-fartsy sophistication. Whenever possible, he presents the adult world from Jack's perspective, so we get a number of interesting shots, such as the instant of birth, the view from a turret window onto the outside world, or a glimpse through a slot in a box at Jack's mother trying to get him to come out and play. Coppola has cleverly crafted every minute of "Jack" for maximum dramatic impact. Coppola fleshes out Williams' superb performance with product references that enhance the juvenile facets of Jack's character. The blinking lights on the heels of Jack's sneakers, for example, are a splendid touch to Williams' shenanigans. Another amusing episode has Williams begging his parents to let him bed down with them, then asking if his "Stimpy" doll can crowd in with them. As Jack's overprotective mom, Diana Lane excels in showing the struggles to deal with a person as fragile as Jack. Of course, Bill Cosby strikes high notes every time he appears without having to steal scenes from Williams. Fran Drescher exudes sexuality but provides more than window dressing as party girl Dolores Durante, the mother of Jack's closest school yard chum, Louis (Adam Zolotin). The bickering duo of girls who harass Jack on the playground are fun to watch, too. "Jack" boasts many wonderful touches. Some touches you may overlook because Coppola so skillfully and invisibly integrates them without appreciating their underlying significance. If the concluding scenes of "Jack" do not move you to tears, you're obviously watching the wrong kind of movie. Ultimately, "Jack" proves that there are more important things in life than size.

    I used to love this movie as a child, i can remember renting it weekly at my local video shop. the fart scene in the cubby house always had me in stitches. now as a 22 year old, having sadly forgotten about this underrated gem, until i remembered it a few weeks ago and hunted for it on DVD. when hunting for some old videos i found a copy that must have somehow snuck into my video collection and i dusted off the old vcr player sat back and watched it. i laughed, i cried, i remembered my childhood. i think what Francis Ford Copella has done is an amazing achievement, it is truly hard for a movie to achieve what Jack does, it's fun for children, and adults who are young at heart. but it also reached me on another level, it reached me on a level of meaning and emotion, it taught me life is short, in a way no other movie has reached me.

    Watching this movie is absolutely stunning. Not because it is a good movie, but because this immature, idiotic, brainless mess was directed by the same person who directed The Godfather! How does that happen? How can a man have such an incredible run in the 70's, making literally some of the greatest movies ever made, and then go on to make Jack? But I digress. Jack is the story about a boy who ages four times faster than a normal human being. He lives in his house with his two loving parents and his tutor, played by Bill Cosby. Why Cosby subjected himself to this schlock I don't know, but that's beside the point. After ten years of seclusion Jack realizes he wants to go to school, so his parents reluctantly enter him in public school. It seems the smarter thing to do would have been to put him in private school, but let's face it, there's nothing smart about this film. But anyways, Jack begins to make friends and meet all kinds of new people, his age and older. What is supposed to be a heartwarming tale of friendship and acceptance really just turns into a silly and jumbled mess with a boring story fueled by a poor script. You know your film is set for disaster when it starts with a dumb premise. There's only so many places a premise like this can go, but the film doesn't even make the most out of what little it has to work with. Every situation is predictable, and nothing elicits a laugh, at least not from me. I could blame this on Jack being a kids film, but the problem is, Jack is not a kids film. It's rated PG-13 and has all sorts of innuendo and adult situations. Jack gets his friends adult magazines and they sit in their treehouse talking about erections and women. So I feel like the humor here is supposed to be adult, but I didn't enjoy it at all, but I hardly think a child would either. It's just too stupid and ridiculous to the point where instead of anything being funny, it is all just sort of awkward and forced. By the end of this film it takes a turn towards the serious, but fails just as much here as it did when it was a comedy. This is probably due to the fact that I just had no interest in the characters or their story by this point in the film. Everything that had happened up to this point was just so pathetic and forgettable that it built a wall between me and the films emotion. Maybe under different circumstances in which the first half of the film had been engaging, the last half would have really pulled at me heart strings. But in this case it didn't at all and I could have cared less what happened to Jack and all his friends. Nothing about this film seems real. It all feels like actors delivering a mediocre script, all the while wondering what the hell they are doing on this set for such a bad movie. Then they remember, oh right! I'm getting to work with the genius behind The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. Only now he's lost his mind and is directing horrible dramadies. Watching a film like this just makes you want to go back and watch the Coppola classics, just to remind yourself that this man is a genius. And that's the thing. With so many incredible films under his belt, Jack can be easily forgotten and we can all pretend like it never happened. Hell, Coppola could direct Smokey and the Bandit sequels for the rest of his life, but he would still go down in history as one of the greatest directors who ever lived. But even if you take Coppola out of the equation, Jack is still an awful movie with no motivation and no heart behind it. Spare yourself the two hours and avoid this film at all costs.

    I do not think Jack is as bad as it is made out to be, but it is one of my least favourite Francis Ford Coppola films. The film is overlong, has some weak spots in the script and drags a bit at times. However, it does look decent, with the cinematography and sceneries nicely done, the soundtrack is credible enough, Coppola directs admirably and I loved the concept(reminded me a bit of Big). Robin Williams also gives an exuberant turn in the lead, while Diane Lane and Brian Kerwin are subtle and Jennifer Lopez is surprisingly sweet and believable. Overall, Jack is a decent enough film. It is lacking a bit and one of the weaker films of a truly great director, but it is worth seeing for Williams and the concept. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    I watched ten minutes of this and felt pretty sick. There have been documentaries on this subject on television of real children that are actually interesting, sad and happy by turns in the real world. What got into people to make such a thing is beyond me. This is the worst kind of sentimental mawkishness and a thoroughly sick and bad idea irrespective of the intentions. I think if we can have a film about marching penguins, or more seriously the columbine massacres shown at the cinema its about time we were able to face an actual documentary about a child with this condition instead of this horrible, horrible proxy for one. By the way... The central conceit that children with this syndrome look like Robin Williams is so very far off beam. In actuality they are the same height as normal children with an adult facial appearance and other attributes. (I know from a made for TV documentary that did this whole thing PROPERLY) This film is a total travesty. Only in America! If you are a buyer for a TV company: I am sure you can find the documentary I watched instead if you really try. Show that instead.

    This movie is better than The Shawshank Redemption and The Godfather combined. It really does belong in the Top 250, because I think this is the best movie I have ever watched. It combines heartfelt drama with childish comedy. It's about a guy named Jack with a disorder that makes him look 4 times his actual age. The acting is phenomenal, and the movie is just great overall and makes you think about life. It is an imaginative, wonderful movie that I recommend to anyone and everyone, if your 6 years old or 60 years old. Don't listen to the low rating. Watch this incredible movie no matter what any critic says. 10/10 or: A+
