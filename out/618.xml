    This picture could be an artifact of the naive and childish romantic notions of the fifties and the plight of women at that time. The audience is asked to suspend reality on too many levels, the first being William Holden as a drop-dead gorgeous young stud. At 37, Holden was prematurely old from alcohol. Even with his shaved chest (which was supposed to make him look younger), he seems closer to 50. All of the gusto and even the lust are forced. Hal would have been an ideal role for Paul Newman or Marlon Brando at that time; maybe Joshua Logan just hated method actors. It would be understandable as to why Kim Novak, the Village Beauty, would dump the richest boy in town (Cliff Robertson) for a loser with no prospects. He would need to have overpowering sex appeal while Holden just appears used-up. In this situation, you can't help but feel for Betty Field's character who knows Madge's life will be a disaster once she marries Hal. The best outcome is that Madge will divorce him before she loses her looks. How audiences, at that time, could consider her union with Hal a happy ending is symptomatic of how delusional and pathetic the nineteen fifties were.

    Many fine scenes in this film make it one to see. Many fine performances as well. However, there are some scenes that are weak and performances in such scenes that aren't as strong as others. Some dialog that doesn't ring true, meaning that it doesn't seem as if it would actually be said that way in reality, but instead is merely a way to get to a point being made. So there are a few stodgy scenes that bring the film in whole down from greatness, to being very good. That doesn't mean it isn't a good film, as it is, just a few missteps along the way. This isn't due to the emotional yet illogical behavior of the leads. Of course, logically we know that the relationship for Hal and Maddie is pretty well doomed to fail just as her mother's did, but such is the nature of people in love, even with a love based upon first impression physical attraction. So the ending of the two lovers going to meet in Tulsa on separate transports is quite telling and foreboding. That in itself nearly wipes away all of the weak scenes.

    Picnic: Never saw it when it came out. Saw Kim Novak on special TCM interview show this week, she of 80 years and still looking wonderful. I DVR'd Picnic, and of course marveled at how young she was at the time this movie was made. No white hair for Kim. Her hair is still a beautiful blonde, and her 2012 clothing in the interview was very stylish. Holden looking wonderful. So what if he was so much older. Alan was his age, and nobody asked how many years after his college graduation. Holden a bum, a loser, with juvenile delinquent record must have been somewhat attractive qualities for Novak, since all she had to compare was goofy rich guy Alan or stupid paperboy Nick Adams. Susan Strasberg couldn't fool her mother with that smoking. Betty Field made a nice mother, and I remember her as Cassandra Tower from Kings Row. Mrs. Potts was very nice, and accepted Holden as he was, not comparing him to some local hometown Romeo. Kings Row was a small town where bad things happened. So was Peyton Place. So was Harmony on TV's Passions. Remember River City, Iowa, in the Music Man? River City's 'crimes' included things such as 'reading a dime novel in the corn crib.' Indeed, small town America has lots of shouldn'ts and secrets, and absolutely everyone knows everyone else's business. We have a particular small town in our state where people left their doors unlocked only ten years ago, but now their minimal crime leads to locked doors. Picnic was where a hot hunk, invited, arrives courtesy of a freight car, into a town in the middle of nowhere and proceeds to take the most beautiful young woman away from the high-rolling scion of the town's wealthy leader. During the actual picnic itself, food and desserts are only the precursors of the steamy evening to come. The Rosalind Russell part was way overdone. She was so desperate. Arthur O'Connell was probably married to his mother, and Roz must have ended up being a very shrewish daughter-in-law, if the mother was still alive. Roz begging Arthur to marry her was so corny, uncomfortable, stupid and dumb. She should have stayed on at the school, where at least the children may have returned her affections. Sticking out her tongue as she departed the school was the most terrible thing I saw her do. It's bye-bye lowly school paycheck, and hello O'Connell's self-employed monthly stipend with probably poverty for Roz and scrubbing those floors on her hands and knees to keep in favor with him -- since apparently he had no passion for her.

    A former college football star drifts into a small town on Labor Day, disrupting the lives of the locals. Director Logan came from a stage background and he never adapted to the film medium. He did not understand that film acting requires more subtlety than stage acting. Holden is certainly not known for overplaying, but Logan pushes him in that direction. He's not helped by some of his lines, particularly his repeatedly calling Novak "Baby." Yes, Inge's play won the Pulitzer Prize, but it is overly dramatic and contains some really corny lines. Russell is quite energetic. Novak, on the other hand, seems to be on a sedative. O'Connell and Strasberg come off best.

    Top rating of the film with one major flaw. This film was originally released in anamorphic (widescreen) and 4 track stereo. All of the DVD releases use pan-scan, which in today's world is ludicrous. You can view the widescreen on Netflix watch instantly when it is available, but if you buy or rent it in it's currently available versions, you get only half of the incredible cinematography. Why would they destroy such a wonderful film? I believe that in order to experience a film of this stature, one should at least be able to see all of what Joshua Logan intended. Aspect ratios aside, this film is a remarkable experience, especially the soundtrack by George Duning. Novak is perfect for the role, and to be realistic William Holden is a bit old for the role of Hal. The subplot romance between Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell just about steals the show. James Wong Howe's spectacular cinematography is the final touch to a really great Hollywood version of the Broadway play. Dated, yes, but still beautiful.

    Corny, old-fashioned, silly, heavy-handed moral messages, obviousÂ…yet it's still masterful. It is one of those pieces that is somehow separate from the sum of its parts. Does it even make sense that something this dated is still this great? Actually, it does. Despite a few very glaring flaws, the film is able to triumph over these setbacks and be great. Let us start with the cinematography, it is only second to perfection. Each scene has just the right amount of touch, just the right amount of editing, and just immaculate framing of shots. It is not some pretend to be great cinematography with amazing exotic landscapes or special effects or anything like that. It is technical diligence where whichever shot is required, be it wide shot, medium shot, two-shot or whatever, it is delivered. Each and every time. This is a film somehow directed to perfection (san the river bank scene, haha). I could continue on about the movie, how things are not preach, but thorough and purposeful, or how it doesn't have to try hard to be stylish, but succeeds in drawing you to its own world,or through all its unlikeliness offers very effective storytellingÂ… but I'd like to keep this review in the same light as the movieÂ…Trite, but true. So, if you are looking for an underrated and overlooked classic, skip "Night of the Hunter" and watch this. 9/10

    Absolutely masterful storytelling. Four story lines united by two beautiful melodies, which themselves are united. Four romance-related stories are intertwined: deepening love between Bill & Kim; painfully destroyed crush of teenager Strasberg; lost love of mother; lost romance ofï»¿ Roz Russel. All roles masterfully acted, with the exception of Bill's stiff dancing. That being said, there, on screen, are your mother and father, andï»¿ all their ancestors, and all your descendants. That's what life is about Â— simply that. By the way, this scene is definitive proof that free will does not exist. Bill didn'tï»¿ have a chance. Guys take note: When women say they want more romance in theirï»¿ lives, this is what they mean. It's worth a shot.

    Corny and hokey. This movie is an example of what can happen when a the storyline of a play is changed to conform to a movie format. What is a tight wrapped theatrical production morphs into something almost unrecognizable from the original on the screen. This movie can be best summed up in one word: hokey. True, the movie was made in 1955, but still, by that time Hollywood was already treating the subject of sex in a more candid manner. This movie takes a great play with a lot of intense interactions and transforms it into an overblown mess with a lot of stagy overacting. Despite the title of the play, the story is not about a picnic, yet the movie makes a picnic a central feature of the story, which diverts the audience's attention from what is going on between the principal characters, who get lost in the crowd. If any movie did not need extras, this is the one. Yet for some reason, this movie has an army of extras playing picnickers. William Holden's performance is good but not especially strong or overpowering and there is little chemistry between him and Kim Novak. Much more intense and better acted are the performances by Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell, both in supportive roles. The movie should have been about them.

    The drifter Hal Carter (William Holden) hitchhikes by train to a small town to visit the college friend Alan Benson (Cliff Robertson), who is the son of the industrialist Mr. Benson (Raymond Bailey) that is the wealthiest person in town. Hal asks for a small job to Ms. Helen Potts (Verna Felton) and the old lady feels affection for him and tells that nobody works in the Labor Day. She gives a breakfast to Hal and he meets her next door neighbor, the gorgeous Marjorie "Madge" Owens (Kim Novak) that is Alan's girlfriend. Then Hal is welcomed by Alan that invites him to go to the local picnic with Madge's younger sister Millie Owens (Susan Strasberg). Hal is a braggart, but attractive and gentle, and he becomes successful with the local girls. However, he falls in love with Madge and Alan feels betrayed by his best friend. "Picnic" is a dated and not believable romance, but also delightful to see. I saw this film for the first day on VHS on 29 January 2003 and in that occasion I liked it more than now. I have just seen this film again on DVD and I found the thirty-seven year old William Holden absolutely miscast in the role of a youngster of twenty and something years old. When the spinster Rosemary (Rosalind Russell) has an argument with Hal and asks him to look himself in the mirror, William Holden is already an older man and the scene loses the impact. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "F&eacute;rias de Amor" ("Vacation of Love")

    This is a pedestrian melodrama that's saved by the great acting from William Holden, Arthur O'Connell, Rosalind Russell and newcomer (for that time) Susan Strasberg. The other major members of the cast perform well, but the core of the story revolves around those four plus the almost ineffable Kim Novak, an actress who'd been around for two/three years before appearing here. It was obvious that she was still learning how to act; however, she was perfect in the role as the girl who is too pretty. And, while Holden performed very well, when he starred in this at 37 he was hardly a young man (a much too lined face) who'd shared a college fraternity with Cliff Robertson (who was 31 or 32) who still managed to look in his mid-twenties for this movie. Holden, however, kept up the pretense and pulled it all off; more kudos to him Â– he had the body for it, anyway. The short synopsis on the main page says all you want to know about the story (boy meets girl); and I won't go into a long analysis of the plot or any of the social analysis. There are other reviews here with excellent accounts for you to read. Instead, I'd like to simply highlight some scenes in this story that are, I think, classicÂ… There are probably three, the first being the sizzling, sexy dance between Holden and Novak at the picnic. Holden, being the energetic show-off, starts to show the young Strasberg a new dance from LA. He tries to explain it, but she is inept at rhythm and moves away, allowing Holden to see Novak, across the floor, her eyes fixed on him as she begins a sensuous sashay down the stairs towards him, performing the dance moves perfectly. He is emotionally skewered; he can't take his eyes off her. They meet softly, slowly, eyes fixed on each other as they meld into an embrace, and glide about, together in their own universe. And, all with that 'Moonglow' theme pulsating in the sound track: hot stuff, pilgrim, for those days when the Hays Code still lurked in the wings. The second occurs soon after: Russell, fed up with her beau (Arthur O'Connell) and his lack of spunk and spark, grabs Holden from Novak and demands a dance: she is so emotionally and sexually frustrated Â– and a little tipsy Â– she loses self-control when Holden pulls away from her roughly, and tears his shirt nearly right off as she still clings to him. Shirt in tatters, exposed chest, Holden feels naked and staggers back; but, she now taunts him about his bragging, toughness and confidence. Verbally, she tears into him, stripping away his composure, and exposes him as the insecure, ignorant and inept wannabe that he is. Perhaps that was not only a cheap shot at lousy shirt manufacturing, but also another cheap slap in the face to Mr Hays. Hey, it worked for me. The final classic scene is between O'Connell and Russell, on the morning after the picnic. Russell is expecting him to come to take her away to get married. He, however, had spent most of the night ruminating about how he was going to get out of it, while also protecting (in his apartment) Holden from the law who were looking for him. So, when O'Connell arrives at Russell's place, she rushes out and immediately assumes O'Connell is there to sweep her off her feet. The scene goes wild as all the women rush about to get Russell ready while poor O'Connell stands there, mute, simply unable or unwilling to cut through the noise to stop the stampede to his personal Armageddon in marriage. O'Connell's face goes through a wonderful variety of expressions that must be seen to be appreciated, but nevertheless, he goes off to his fate. Now, I wonder if O'Connell had studied Buster Keaton's silent exploits... Those three are worth seeing, for sure. As I said, however, the rest of the story is standard fare, albeit a quality production that shows off small town America, with all its contradictions (as in any culture); and despite what I think is a clunky, clich&eacute;d script, at times. But, Logan and his crew do it well, especially the photography from James Wong Howe, leaving this viewer with a movie that I'd watch again Â– well, those three scenes again, at least. Great stuff. I saw this movie back in 1956 or 1957 when it reached Australia. As I recall, I sort of liked it then, especially Novak. This was my second viewing; and I'm glad I did see it again. Give it a six out of ten. Recommended for all. February 28, 2012

What is a tight wrapped theatrical production morphs into something almost unrecognizable from the original on the screen. This movie can be best summed up in one word: hokey. True, the movie was made in 1955, but still, by that time Hollywood was already treating the subject of sex in a more candid manner. This movie takes a great play with a lot of intense interactions and transforms it into an overblown mess with a lot of stagy overacting. Despite the title of the play, the story is not about a picnic, yet the movie makes a picnic a central feature of the story, which diverts the audience's attention from what is going on between the principal characters, who get lost in the crowd. If any movie did not need extras, this is the one. Yet for some reason, this movie has an army of extras playing picnickers. William Holden's performance is good but not especially strong or overpowering and there is little chemistry between him and Kim Novak. Much more intense and better acted are the performances by Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell, both in supportive roles. The movie should have been about them.

    The drifter Hal Carter (William Holden) hitchhikes by train to a small town to visit the college friend Alan Benson (Cliff Robertson), who is the son of the industrialist Mr. Benson (Raymond Bailey) that is the wealthiest person in town. Hal asks for a small job to Ms. Helen Potts (Verna Felton) and the old lady feels affection for him and tells that nobody works in the Labor Day. She gives a breakfast to Hal and he meets her next door neighbor, the gorgeous Marjorie "Madge" Owens (Kim Novak) that is Alan's girlfriend. Then Hal is welcomed by Alan that invites him to go to the local picnic with Madge's younger sister Millie Owens (Susan Strasberg). Hal is a braggart, but attractive and gentle, and he becomes successful with the local girls. However, he falls in love with Madge and Alan feels betrayed by his best friend. "Picnic" is a dated and not believable romance, but also delightful to see. I saw this film for the first day on VHS on 29 January 2003 and in that occasion I liked it more than now. I have just seen this film again on DVD and I found the thirty-seven year old William Holden absolutely miscast in the role of a youngster of twenty and something years old. When the spinster Rosemary (Rosalind Russell) has an argument with Hal and asks him to look himself in the mirror, William Holden is already an older man and the scene loses the impact. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "F&eacute;rias de Amor" ("Vacation of Love")

    This is a pedestrian melodrama that's saved by the great acting from William Holden, Arthur O'Connell, Rosalind Russell and newcomer (for that time) Susan Strasberg. The other major members of the cast perform well, but the core of the story revolves around those four plus the almost ineffable Kim Novak, an actress who'd been around for two/three years before appearing here. It was obvious that she was still learning how to act; however, she was perfect in the role as the girl who is too pretty. And, while Holden performed very well, when he starred in this at 37 he was hardly a young man (a much too lined face) who'd shared a college fraternity with Cliff Robertson (who was 31 or 32) who still managed to look in his mid-twenties for this movie. Holden, however, kept up the pretense and pulled it all off; more kudos to him Â– he had the body for it, anyway. The short synopsis on the main page says all you want to know about the story (boy meets girl); and I won't go into a long analysis of the plot or any of the social analysis. There are other reviews here with excellent accounts for you to read. Instead, I'd like to simply highlight some scenes in this story that are, I think, classicÂ… There are probably three, the first being the sizzling, sexy dance between Holden and Novak at the picnic. Holden, being the energetic show-off, starts to show the young Strasberg a new dance from LA. He tries to explain it, but she is inept at rhythm and moves away, allowing Holden to see Novak, across the floor, her eyes fixed on him as she begins a sensuous sashay down the stairs towards him, performing the dance moves perfectly. He is emotionally skewered; he can't take his eyes off her. They meet softly, slowly, eyes fixed on each other as they meld into an embrace, and glide about, together in their own universe. And, all with that 'Moonglow' theme pulsating in the sound track: hot stuff, pilgrim, for those days when the Hays Code still lurked in the wings. The second occurs soon after: Russell, fed up with her beau (Arthur O'Connell) and his lack of spunk and spark, grabs Holden from Novak and demands a dance: she is so emotionally and sexually frustrated Â– and a little tipsy Â– she loses self-control when Holden pulls away from her roughly, and tears his shirt nearly right off as she still clings to him. Shirt in tatters, exposed chest, Holden feels naked and staggers back; but, she now taunts him about his bragging, toughness and confidence. Verbally, she tears into him, stripping away his composure, and exposes him as the insecure, ignorant and inept wannabe that he is. Perhaps that was not only a cheap shot at lousy shirt manufacturing, but also another cheap slap in the face to Mr Hays. Hey, it worked for me. The final classic scene is between O'Connell and Russell, on the morning after the picnic. Russell is expecting him to come to take her away to get married. He, however, had spent most of the night ruminating about how he was going to get out of it, while also protecting (in his apartment) Holden from the law who were looking for him. So, when O'Connell arrives at Russell's place, she rushes out and immediately assumes O'Connell is there to sweep her off her feet. The scene goes wild as all the women rush about to get Russell ready while poor O'Connell stands there, mute, simply unable or unwilling to cut through the noise to stop the stampede to his personal Armageddon in marriage. O'Connell's face goes through a wonderful variety of expressions that must be seen to be appreciated, but nevertheless, he goes off to his fate. Now, I wonder if O'Connell had studied Buster Keaton's silent exploits... Those three are worth seeing, for sure. As I said, however, the rest of the story is standard fare, albeit a quality production that shows off small town America, with all its contradictions (as in any culture); and despite what I think is a clunky, clich&eacute;d script, at times. But, Logan and his crew do it well, especially the photography from James Wong Howe, leaving this viewer with a movie that I'd watch again Â– well, those three scenes again, at least. Great stuff. I saw this movie back in 1956 or 1957 when it reached Australia. As I recall, I sort of liked it then, especially Novak. This was my second viewing; and I'm glad I did see it again. Give it a six out of ten. Recommended for all. February 28, 2012

    This picture could be an artifact of the naive and childish romantic notions of the fifties and the plight of women at that time. The audience is asked to suspend reality on too many levels, the first being William Holden as a drop-dead gorgeous young stud. At 37, Holden was prematurely old from alcohol. Even with his shaved chest (which was supposed to make him look younger), he seems closer to 50. All of the gusto and even the lust are forced. Hal would have been an ideal role for Paul Newman or Marlon Brando at that time; maybe Joshua Logan just hated method actors. It would be understandable as to why Kim Novak, the Village Beauty, would dump the richest boy in town (Cliff Robertson) for a loser with no prospects. He would need to have overpowering sex appeal while Holden just appears used-up. In this situation, you can't help but feel for Betty Field's character who knows Madge's life will be a disaster once she marries Hal. The best outcome is that Madge will divorce him before she loses her looks. How audiences, at that time, could consider her union with Hal a happy ending is symptomatic of how delusional and pathetic the nineteen fifties were.

    Many fine scenes in this film make it one to see. Many fine performances as well. However, there are some scenes that are weak and performances in such scenes that aren't as strong as others. Some dialog that doesn't ring true, meaning that it doesn't seem as if it would actually be said that way in reality, but instead is merely a way to get to a point being made. So there are a few stodgy scenes that bring the film in whole down from greatness, to being very good. That doesn't mean it isn't a good film, as it is, just a few missteps along the way. This isn't due to the emotional yet illogical behavior of the leads. Of course, logically we know that the relationship for Hal and Maddie is pretty well doomed to fail just as her mother's did, but such is the nature of people in love, even with a love based upon first impression physical attraction. So the ending of the two lovers going to meet in Tulsa on separate transports is quite telling and foreboding. That in itself nearly wipes away all of the weak scenes.

    Picnic: Never saw it when it came out. Saw Kim Novak on special TCM interview show this week, she of 80 years and still looking wonderful. I DVR'd Picnic, and of course marveled at how young she was at the time this movie was made. No white hair for Kim. Her hair is still a beautiful blonde, and her 2012 clothing in the interview was very stylish. Holden looking wonderful. So what if he was so much older. Alan was his age, and nobody asked how many years after his college graduation. Holden a bum, a loser, with juvenile delinquent record must have been somewhat attractive qualities for Novak, since all she had to compare was goofy rich guy Alan or stupid paperboy Nick Adams. Susan Strasberg couldn't fool her mother with that smoking. Betty Field made a nice mother, and I remember her as Cassandra Tower from Kings Row. Mrs. Potts was very nice, and accepted Holden as he was, not comparing him to some local hometown Romeo. Kings Row was a small town where bad things happened. So was Peyton Place. So was Harmony on TV's Passions. Remember River City, Iowa, in the Music Man? River City's 'crimes' included things such as 'reading a dime novel in the corn crib.' Indeed, small town America has lots of shouldn'ts and secrets, and absolutely everyone knows everyone else's business. We have a particular small town in our state where people left their doors unlocked only ten years ago, but now their minimal crime leads to locked doors. Picnic was where a hot hunk, invited, arrives courtesy of a freight car, into a town in the middle of nowhere and proceeds to take the most beautiful young woman away from the high-rolling scion of the town's wealthy leader. During the actual picnic itself, food and desserts are only the precursors of the steamy evening to come. The Rosalind Russell part was way overdone. She was so desperate. Arthur O'Connell was probably married to his mother, and Roz must have ended up being a very shrewish daughter-in-law, if the mother was still alive. Roz begging Arthur to marry her was so corny, uncomfortable, stupid and dumb. She should have stayed on at the school, where at least the children may have returned her affections. Sticking out her tongue as she departed the school was the most terrible thing I saw her do. It's bye-bye lowly school paycheck, and hello O'Connell's self-employed monthly stipend with probably poverty for Roz and scrubbing those floors on her hands and knees to keep in favor with him -- since apparently he had no passion for her.

    A former college football star drifts into a small town on Labor Day, disrupting the lives of the locals. Director Logan came from a stage background and he never adapted to the film medium. He did not understand that film acting requires more subtlety than stage acting. Holden is certainly not known for overplaying, but Logan pushes him in that direction. He's not helped by some of his lines, particularly his repeatedly calling Novak "Baby." Yes, Inge's play won the Pulitzer Prize, but it is overly dramatic and contains some really corny lines. Russell is quite energetic. Novak, on the other hand, seems to be on a sedative. O'Connell and Strasberg come off best.

    Top rating of the film with one major flaw. This film was originally released in anamorphic (widescreen) and 4 track stereo. All of the DVD releases use pan-scan, which in today's world is ludicrous. You can view the widescreen on Netflix watch instantly when it is available, but if you buy or rent it in it's currently available versions, you get only half of the incredible cinematography. Why would they destroy such a wonderful film? I believe that in order to experience a film of this stature, one should at least be able to see all of what Joshua Logan intended. Aspect ratios aside, this film is a remarkable experience, especially the soundtrack by George Duning. Novak is perfect for the role, and to be realistic William Holden is a bit old for the role of Hal. The subplot romance between Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell just about steals the show. James Wong Howe's spectacular cinematography is the final touch to a really great Hollywood version of the Broadway play. Dated, yes, but still beautiful.

    Corny, old-fashioned, silly, heavy-handed moral messages, obviousÂ…yet it's still masterful. It is one of those pieces that is somehow separate from the sum of its parts. Does it even make sense that something this dated is still this great? Actually, it does. Despite a few very glaring flaws, the film is able to triumph over these setbacks and be great. Let us start with the cinematography, it is only second to perfection. Each scene has just the right amount of touch, just the right amount of editing, and just immaculate framing of shots. It is not some pretend to be great cinematography with amazing exotic landscapes or special effects or anything like that. It is technical diligence where whichever shot is required, be it wide shot, medium shot, two-shot or whatever, it is delivered. Each and every time. This is a film somehow directed to perfection (san the river bank scene, haha). I could continue on about the movie, how things are not preach, but thorough and purposeful, or how it doesn't have to try hard to be stylish, but succeeds in drawing you to its own world,or through all its unlikeliness offers very effective storytellingÂ… but I'd like to keep this review in the same light as the movieÂ…Trite, but true. So, if you are looking for an underrated and overlooked classic, skip "Night of the Hunter" and watch this. 9/10

    Absolutely masterful storytelling. Four story lines united by two beautiful melodies, which themselves are united. Four romance-related stories are intertwined: deepening love between Bill & Kim; painfully destroyed crush of teenager Strasberg; lost love of mother; lost romance ofï»¿ Roz Russel. All roles masterfully acted, with the exception of Bill's stiff dancing. That being said, there, on screen, are your mother and father, andï»¿ all their ancestors, and all your descendants. That's what life is about Â— simply that. By the way, this scene is definitive proof that free will does not exist. Bill didn'tï»¿ have a chance. Guys take note: When women say they want more romance in theirï»¿ lives, this is what they mean. It's worth a shot.

    A former college football star drifts into a small town on Labor Day, disrupting the lives of the locals. Director Logan came from a stage background and he never adapted to the film medium. He did not understand that film acting requires more subtlety than stage acting. Holden is certainly not known for overplaying, but Logan pushes him in that direction. He's not helped by some of his lines, particularly his repeatedly calling Novak "Baby." Yes, Inge's play won the Pulitzer Prize, but it is overly dramatic and contains some really corny lines. Russell is quite energetic. Novak, on the other hand, seems to be on a sedative. O'Connell and Strasberg come off best.

    Top rating of the film with one major flaw. This film was originally released in anamorphic (widescreen) and 4 track stereo. All of the DVD releases use pan-scan, which in today's world is ludicrous. You can view the widescreen on Netflix watch instantly when it is available, but if you buy or rent it in it's currently available versions, you get only half of the incredible cinematography. Why would they destroy such a wonderful film? I believe that in order to experience a film of this stature, one should at least be able to see all of what Joshua Logan intended. Aspect ratios aside, this film is a remarkable experience, especially the soundtrack by George Duning. Novak is perfect for the role, and to be realistic William Holden is a bit old for the role of Hal. The subplot romance between Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell just about steals the show. James Wong Howe's spectacular cinematography is the final touch to a really great Hollywood version of the Broadway play. Dated, yes, but still beautiful.

    Corny, old-fashioned, silly, heavy-handed moral messages, obviousÂ…yet it's still masterful. It is one of those pieces that is somehow separate from the sum of its parts. Does it even make sense that something this dated is still this great? Actually, it does. Despite a few very glaring flaws, the film is able to triumph over these setbacks and be great. Let us start with the cinematography, it is only second to perfection. Each scene has just the right amount of touch, just the right amount of editing, and just immaculate framing of shots. It is not some pretend to be great cinematography with amazing exotic landscapes or special effects or anything like that. It is technical diligence where whichever shot is required, be it wide shot, medium shot, two-shot or whatever, it is delivered. Each and every time. This is a film somehow directed to perfection (san the river bank scene, haha). I could continue on about the movie, how things are not preach, but thorough and purposeful, or how it doesn't have to try hard to be stylish, but succeeds in drawing you to its own world,or through all its unlikeliness offers very effective storytellingÂ… but I'd like to keep this review in the same light as the movieÂ…Trite, but true. So, if you are looking for an underrated and overlooked classic, skip "Night of the Hunter" and watch this. 9/10

    Absolutely masterful storytelling. Four story lines united by two beautiful melodies, which themselves are united. Four romance-related stories are intertwined: deepening love between Bill & Kim; painfully destroyed crush of teenager Strasberg; lost love of mother; lost romance ofï»¿ Roz Russel. All roles masterfully acted, with the exception of Bill's stiff dancing. That being said, there, on screen, are your mother and father, andï»¿ all their ancestors, and all your descendants. That's what life is about Â— simply that. By the way, this scene is definitive proof that free will does not exist. Bill didn'tï»¿ have a chance. Guys take note: When women say they want more romance in theirï»¿ lives, this is what they mean. It's worth a shot.

    Corny and hokey. This movie is an example of what can happen when a the storyline of a play is changed to conform to a movie format. What is a tight wrapped theatrical production morphs into something almost unrecognizable from the original on the screen. This movie can be best summed up in one word: hokey. True, the movie was made in 1955, but still, by that time Hollywood was already treating the subject of sex in a more candid manner. This movie takes a great play with a lot of intense interactions and transforms it into an overblown mess with a lot of stagy overacting. Despite the title of the play, the story is not about a picnic, yet the movie makes a picnic a central feature of the story, which diverts the audience's attention from what is going on between the principal characters, who get lost in the crowd. If any movie did not need extras, this is the one. Yet for some reason, this movie has an army of extras playing picnickers. William Holden's performance is good but not especially strong or overpowering and there is little chemistry between him and Kim Novak. Much more intense and better acted are the performances by Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell, both in supportive roles. The movie should have been about them.

    The drifter Hal Carter (William Holden) hitchhikes by train to a small town to visit the college friend Alan Benson (Cliff Robertson), who is the son of the industrialist Mr. Benson (Raymond Bailey) that is the wealthiest person in town. Hal asks for a small job to Ms. Helen Potts (Verna Felton) and the old lady feels affection for him and tells that nobody works in the Labor Day. She gives a breakfast to Hal and he meets her next door neighbor, the gorgeous Marjorie "Madge" Owens (Kim Novak) that is Alan's girlfriend. Then Hal is welcomed by Alan that invites him to go to the local picnic with Madge's younger sister Millie Owens (Susan Strasberg). Hal is a braggart, but attractive and gentle, and he becomes successful with the local girls. However, he falls in love with Madge and Alan feels betrayed by his best friend. "Picnic" is a dated and not believable romance, but also delightful to see. I saw this film for the first day on VHS on 29 January 2003 and in that occasion I liked it more than now. I have just seen this film again on DVD and I found the thirty-seven year old William Holden absolutely miscast in the role of a youngster of twenty and something years old. When the spinster Rosemary (Rosalind Russell) has an argument with Hal and asks him to look himself in the mirror, William Holden is already an older man and the scene loses the impact. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "F&eacute;rias de Amor" ("Vacation of Love")

    This is a pedestrian melodrama that's saved by the great acting from William Holden, Arthur O'Connell, Rosalind Russell and newcomer (for that time) Susan Strasberg. The other major members of the cast perform well, but the core of the story revolves around those four plus the almost ineffable Kim Novak, an actress who'd been around for two/three years before appearing here. It was obvious that she was still learning how to act; however, she was perfect in the role as the girl who is too pretty. And, while Holden performed very well, when he starred in this at 37 he was hardly a young man (a much too lined face) who'd shared a college fraternity with Cliff Robertson (who was 31 or 32) who still managed to look in his mid-twenties for this movie. Holden, however, kept up the pretense and pulled it all off; more kudos to him Â– he had the body for it, anyway. The short synopsis on the main page says all you want to know about the story (boy meets girl); and I won't go into a long analysis of the plot or any of the social analysis. There are other reviews here with excellent accounts for you to read. Instead, I'd like to simply highlight some scenes in this story that are, I think, classicÂ… There are probably three, the first being the sizzling, sexy dance between Holden and Novak at the picnic. Holden, being the energetic show-off, starts to show the young Strasberg a new dance from LA. He tries to explain it, but she is inept at rhythm and moves away, allowing Holden to see Novak, across the floor, her eyes fixed on him as she begins a sensuous sashay down the stairs towards him, performing the dance moves perfectly. He is emotionally skewered; he can't take his eyes off her. They meet softly, slowly, eyes fixed on each other as they meld into an embrace, and glide about, together in their own universe. And, all with that 'Moonglow' theme pulsating in the sound track: hot stuff, pilgrim, for those days when the Hays Code still lurked in the wings. The second occurs soon after: Russell, fed up with her beau (Arthur O'Connell) and his lack of spunk and spark, grabs Holden from Novak and demands a dance: she is so emotionally and sexually frustrated Â– and a little tipsy Â– she loses self-control when Holden pulls away from her roughly, and tears his shirt nearly right off as she still clings to him. Shirt in tatters, exposed chest, Holden feels naked and staggers back; but, she now taunts him about his bragging, toughness and confidence. Verbally, she tears into him, stripping away his composure, and exposes him as the insecure, ignorant and inept wannabe that he is. Perhaps that was not only a cheap shot at lousy shirt manufacturing, but also another cheap slap in the face to Mr Hays. Hey, it worked for me. The final classic scene is between O'Connell and Russell, on the morning after the picnic. Russell is expecting him to come to take her away to get married. He, however, had spent most of the night ruminating about how he was going to get out of it, while also protecting (in his apartment) Holden from the law who were looking for him. So, when O'Connell arrives at Russell's place, she rushes out and immediately assumes O'Connell is there to sweep her off her feet. The scene goes wild as all the women rush about to get Russell ready while poor O'Connell stands there, mute, simply unable or unwilling to cut through the noise to stop the stampede to his personal Armageddon in marriage. O'Connell's face goes through a wonderful variety of expressions that must be seen to be appreciated, but nevertheless, he goes off to his fate. Now, I wonder if O'Connell had studied Buster Keaton's silent exploits... Those three are worth seeing, for sure. As I said, however, the rest of the story is standard fare, albeit a quality production that shows off small town America, with all its contradictions (as in any culture); and despite what I think is a clunky, clich&eacute;d script, at times. But, Logan and his crew do it well, especially the photography from James Wong Howe, leaving this viewer with a movie that I'd watch again Â– well, those three scenes again, at least. Great stuff. I saw this movie back in 1956 or 1957 when it reached Australia. As I recall, I sort of liked it then, especially Novak. This was my second viewing; and I'm glad I did see it again. Give it a six out of ten. Recommended for all. February 28, 2012

    This picture could be an artifact of the naive and childish romantic notions of the fifties and the plight of women at that time. The audience is asked to suspend reality on too many levels, the first being William Holden as a drop-dead gorgeous young stud. At 37, Holden was prematurely old from alcohol. Even with his shaved chest (which was supposed to make him look younger), he seems closer to 50. All of the gusto and even the lust are forced. Hal would have been an ideal role for Paul Newman or Marlon Brando at that time; maybe Joshua Logan just hated method actors. It would be understandable as to why Kim Novak, the Village Beauty, would dump the richest boy in town (Cliff Robertson) for a loser with no prospects. He would need to have overpowering sex appeal while Holden just appears used-up. In this situation, you can't help but feel for Betty Field's character who knows Madge's life will be a disaster once she marries Hal. The best outcome is that Madge will divorce him before she loses her looks. How audiences, at that time, could consider her union with Hal a happy ending is symptomatic of how delusional and pathetic the nineteen fifties were.

    Many fine scenes in this film make it one to see. Many fine performances as well. However, there are some scenes that are weak and performances in such scenes that aren't as strong as others. Some dialog that doesn't ring true, meaning that it doesn't seem as if it would actually be said that way in reality, but instead is merely a way to get to a point being made. So there are a few stodgy scenes that bring the film in whole down from greatness, to being very good. That doesn't mean it isn't a good film, as it is, just a few missteps along the way. This isn't due to the emotional yet illogical behavior of the leads. Of course, logically we know that the relationship for Hal and Maddie is pretty well doomed to fail just as her mother's did, but such is the nature of people in love, even with a love based upon first impression physical attraction. So the ending of the two lovers going to meet in Tulsa on separate transports is quite telling and foreboding. That in itself nearly wipes away all of the weak scenes.

    Picnic: Never saw it when it came out. Saw Kim Novak on special TCM interview show this week, she of 80 years and still looking wonderful. I DVR'd Picnic, and of course marveled at how young she was at the time this movie was made. No white hair for Kim. Her hair is still a beautiful blonde, and her 2012 clothing in the interview was very stylish. Holden looking wonderful. So what if he was so much older. Alan was his age, and nobody asked how many years after his college graduation. Holden a bum, a loser, with juvenile delinquent record must have been somewhat attractive qualities for Novak, since all she had to compare was goofy rich guy Alan or stupid paperboy Nick Adams. Susan Strasberg couldn't fool her mother with that smoking. Betty Field made a nice mother, and I remember her as Cassandra Tower from Kings Row. Mrs. Potts was very nice, and accepted Holden as he was, not comparing him to some local hometown Romeo. Kings Row was a small town where bad things happened. So was Peyton Place. So was Harmony on TV's Passions. Remember River City, Iowa, in the Music Man? River City's 'crimes' included things such as 'reading a dime novel in the corn crib.' Indeed, small town America has lots of shouldn'ts and secrets, and absolutely everyone knows everyone else's business. We have a particular small town in our state where people left their doors unlocked only ten years ago, but now their minimal crime leads to locked doors. Picnic was where a hot hunk, invited, arrives courtesy of a freight car, into a town in the middle of nowhere and proceeds to take the most beautiful young woman away from the high-rolling scion of the town's wealthy leader. During the actual picnic itself, food and desserts are only the precursors of the steamy evening to come. The Rosalind Russell part was way overdone. She was so desperate. Arthur O'Connell was probably married to his mother, and Roz must have ended up being a very shrewish daughter-in-law, if the mother was still alive. Roz begging Arthur to marry her was so corny, uncomfortable, stupid and dumb. She should have stayed on at the school, where at least the children may have returned her affections. Sticking out her tongue as she departed the school was the most terrible thing I saw her do. It's bye-bye lowly school paycheck, and hello O'Connell's self-employed monthly stipend with probably poverty for Roz and scrubbing those floors on her hands and knees to keep in favor with him -- since apparently he had no passion for her.

The audience is asked to suspend reality on too many levels, the first being William Holden as a drop-dead gorgeous young stud. At 37, Holden was prematurely old from alcohol. Even with his shaved chest (which was supposed to make him look younger), he seems closer to 50. All of the gusto and even the lust are forced. Hal would have been an ideal role for Paul Newman or Marlon Brando at that time; maybe Joshua Logan just hated method actors. It would be understandable as to why Kim Novak, the Village Beauty, would dump the richest boy in town (Cliff Robertson) for a loser with no prospects. He would need to have overpowering sex appeal while Holden just appears used-up. In this situation, you can't help but feel for Betty Field's character who knows Madge's life will be a disaster once she marries Hal. The best outcome is that Madge will divorce him before she loses her looks. How audiences, at that time, could consider her union with Hal a happy ending is symptomatic of how delusional and pathetic the nineteen fifties were.

    Many fine scenes in this film make it one to see. Many fine performances as well. However, there are some scenes that are weak and performances in such scenes that aren't as strong as others. Some dialog that doesn't ring true, meaning that it doesn't seem as if it would actually be said that way in reality, but instead is merely a way to get to a point being made. So there are a few stodgy scenes that bring the film in whole down from greatness, to being very good. That doesn't mean it isn't a good film, as it is, just a few missteps along the way. This isn't due to the emotional yet illogical behavior of the leads. Of course, logically we know that the relationship for Hal and Maddie is pretty well doomed to fail just as her mother's did, but such is the nature of people in love, even with a love based upon first impression physical attraction. So the ending of the two lovers going to meet in Tulsa on separate transports is quite telling and foreboding. That in itself nearly wipes away all of the weak scenes.

    Picnic: Never saw it when it came out. Saw Kim Novak on special TCM interview show this week, she of 80 years and still looking wonderful. I DVR'd Picnic, and of course marveled at how young she was at the time this movie was made. No white hair for Kim. Her hair is still a beautiful blonde, and her 2012 clothing in the interview was very stylish. Holden looking wonderful. So what if he was so much older. Alan was his age, and nobody asked how many years after his college graduation. Holden a bum, a loser, with juvenile delinquent record must have been somewhat attractive qualities for Novak, since all she had to compare was goofy rich guy Alan or stupid paperboy Nick Adams. Susan Strasberg couldn't fool her mother with that smoking. Betty Field made a nice mother, and I remember her as Cassandra Tower from Kings Row. Mrs. Potts was very nice, and accepted Holden as he was, not comparing him to some local hometown Romeo. Kings Row was a small town where bad things happened. So was Peyton Place. So was Harmony on TV's Passions. Remember River City, Iowa, in the Music Man? River City's 'crimes' included things such as 'reading a dime novel in the corn crib.' Indeed, small town America has lots of shouldn'ts and secrets, and absolutely everyone knows everyone else's business. We have a particular small town in our state where people left their doors unlocked only ten years ago, but now their minimal crime leads to locked doors. Picnic was where a hot hunk, invited, arrives courtesy of a freight car, into a town in the middle of nowhere and proceeds to take the most beautiful young woman away from the high-rolling scion of the town's wealthy leader. During the actual picnic itself, food and desserts are only the precursors of the steamy evening to come. The Rosalind Russell part was way overdone. She was so desperate. Arthur O'Connell was probably married to his mother, and Roz must have ended up being a very shrewish daughter-in-law, if the mother was still alive. Roz begging Arthur to marry her was so corny, uncomfortable, stupid and dumb. She should have stayed on at the school, where at least the children may have returned her affections. Sticking out her tongue as she departed the school was the most terrible thing I saw her do. It's bye-bye lowly school paycheck, and hello O'Connell's self-employed monthly stipend with probably poverty for Roz and scrubbing those floors on her hands and knees to keep in favor with him -- since apparently he had no passion for her.

    A former college football star drifts into a small town on Labor Day, disrupting the lives of the locals. Director Logan came from a stage background and he never adapted to the film medium. He did not understand that film acting requires more subtlety than stage acting. Holden is certainly not known for overplaying, but Logan pushes him in that direction. He's not helped by some of his lines, particularly his repeatedly calling Novak "Baby." Yes, Inge's play won the Pulitzer Prize, but it is overly dramatic and contains some really corny lines. Russell is quite energetic. Novak, on the other hand, seems to be on a sedative. O'Connell and Strasberg come off best.

    Top rating of the film with one major flaw. This film was originally released in anamorphic (widescreen) and 4 track stereo. All of the DVD releases use pan-scan, which in today's world is ludicrous. You can view the widescreen on Netflix watch instantly when it is available, but if you buy or rent it in it's currently available versions, you get only half of the incredible cinematography. Why would they destroy such a wonderful film? I believe that in order to experience a film of this stature, one should at least be able to see all of what Joshua Logan intended. Aspect ratios aside, this film is a remarkable experience, especially the soundtrack by George Duning. Novak is perfect for the role, and to be realistic William Holden is a bit old for the role of Hal. The subplot romance between Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell just about steals the show. James Wong Howe's spectacular cinematography is the final touch to a really great Hollywood version of the Broadway play. Dated, yes, but still beautiful.

    Corny, old-fashioned, silly, heavy-handed moral messages, obviousÂ…yet it's still masterful. It is one of those pieces that is somehow separate from the sum of its parts. Does it even make sense that something this dated is still this great? Actually, it does. Despite a few very glaring flaws, the film is able to triumph over these setbacks and be great. Let us start with the cinematography, it is only second to perfection. Each scene has just the right amount of touch, just the right amount of editing, and just immaculate framing of shots. It is not some pretend to be great cinematography with amazing exotic landscapes or special effects or anything like that. It is technical diligence where whichever shot is required, be it wide shot, medium shot, two-shot or whatever, it is delivered. Each and every time. This is a film somehow directed to perfection (san the river bank scene, haha). I could continue on about the movie, how things are not preach, but thorough and purposeful, or how it doesn't have to try hard to be stylish, but succeeds in drawing you to its own world,or through all its unlikeliness offers very effective storytellingÂ… but I'd like to keep this review in the same light as the movieÂ…Trite, but true. So, if you are looking for an underrated and overlooked classic, skip "Night of the Hunter" and watch this. 9/10

    Absolutely masterful storytelling. Four story lines united by two beautiful melodies, which themselves are united. Four romance-related stories are intertwined: deepening love between Bill & Kim; painfully destroyed crush of teenager Strasberg; lost love of mother; lost romance ofï»¿ Roz Russel. All roles masterfully acted, with the exception of Bill's stiff dancing. That being said, there, on screen, are your mother and father, andï»¿ all their ancestors, and all your descendants. That's what life is about Â— simply that. By the way, this scene is definitive proof that free will does not exist. Bill didn'tï»¿ have a chance. Guys take note: When women say they want more romance in theirï»¿ lives, this is what they mean. It's worth a shot.

    Corny and hokey. This movie is an example of what can happen when a the storyline of a play is changed to conform to a movie format. What is a tight wrapped theatrical production morphs into something almost unrecognizable from the original on the screen. This movie can be best summed up in one word: hokey. True, the movie was made in 1955, but still, by that time Hollywood was already treating the subject of sex in a more candid manner. This movie takes a great play with a lot of intense interactions and transforms it into an overblown mess with a lot of stagy overacting. Despite the title of the play, the story is not about a picnic, yet the movie makes a picnic a central feature of the story, which diverts the audience's attention from what is going on between the principal characters, who get lost in the crowd. If any movie did not need extras, this is the one. Yet for some reason, this movie has an army of extras playing picnickers. William Holden's performance is good but not especially strong or overpowering and there is little chemistry between him and Kim Novak. Much more intense and better acted are the performances by Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell, both in supportive roles. The movie should have been about them.

    The drifter Hal Carter (William Holden) hitchhikes by train to a small town to visit the college friend Alan Benson (Cliff Robertson), who is the son of the industrialist Mr. Benson (Raymond Bailey) that is the wealthiest person in town. Hal asks for a small job to Ms. Helen Potts (Verna Felton) and the old lady feels affection for him and tells that nobody works in the Labor Day. She gives a breakfast to Hal and he meets her next door neighbor, the gorgeous Marjorie "Madge" Owens (Kim Novak) that is Alan's girlfriend. Then Hal is welcomed by Alan that invites him to go to the local picnic with Madge's younger sister Millie Owens (Susan Strasberg). Hal is a braggart, but attractive and gentle, and he becomes successful with the local girls. However, he falls in love with Madge and Alan feels betrayed by his best friend. "Picnic" is a dated and not believable romance, but also delightful to see. I saw this film for the first day on VHS on 29 January 2003 and in that occasion I liked it more than now. I have just seen this film again on DVD and I found the thirty-seven year old William Holden absolutely miscast in the role of a youngster of twenty and something years old. When the spinster Rosemary (Rosalind Russell) has an argument with Hal and asks him to look himself in the mirror, William Holden is already an older man and the scene loses the impact. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "F&eacute;rias de Amor" ("Vacation of Love")

    This is a pedestrian melodrama that's saved by the great acting from William Holden, Arthur O'Connell, Rosalind Russell and newcomer (for that time) Susan Strasberg. The other major members of the cast perform well, but the core of the story revolves around those four plus the almost ineffable Kim Novak, an actress who'd been around for two/three years before appearing here. It was obvious that she was still learning how to act; however, she was perfect in the role as the girl who is too pretty. And, while Holden performed very well, when he starred in this at 37 he was hardly a young man (a much too lined face) who'd shared a college fraternity with Cliff Robertson (who was 31 or 32) who still managed to look in his mid-twenties for this movie. Holden, however, kept up the pretense and pulled it all off; more kudos to him Â– he had the body for it, anyway. The short synopsis on the main page says all you want to know about the story (boy meets girl); and I won't go into a long analysis of the plot or any of the social analysis. There are other reviews here with excellent accounts for you to read. Instead, I'd like to simply highlight some scenes in this story that are, I think, classicÂ… There are probably three, the first being the sizzling, sexy dance between Holden and Novak at the picnic. Holden, being the energetic show-off, starts to show the young Strasberg a new dance from LA. He tries to explain it, but she is inept at rhythm and moves away, allowing Holden to see Novak, across the floor, her eyes fixed on him as she begins a sensuous sashay down the stairs towards him, performing the dance moves perfectly. He is emotionally skewered; he can't take his eyes off her. They meet softly, slowly, eyes fixed on each other as they meld into an embrace, and glide about, together in their own universe. And, all with that 'Moonglow' theme pulsating in the sound track: hot stuff, pilgrim, for those days when the Hays Code still lurked in the wings. The second occurs soon after: Russell, fed up with her beau (Arthur O'Connell) and his lack of spunk and spark, grabs Holden from Novak and demands a dance: she is so emotionally and sexually frustrated Â– and a little tipsy Â– she loses self-control when Holden pulls away from her roughly, and tears his shirt nearly right off as she still clings to him. Shirt in tatters, exposed chest, Holden feels naked and staggers back; but, she now taunts him about his bragging, toughness and confidence. Verbally, she tears into him, stripping away his composure, and exposes him as the insecure, ignorant and inept wannabe that he is. Perhaps that was not only a cheap shot at lousy shirt manufacturing, but also another cheap slap in the face to Mr Hays. Hey, it worked for me. The final classic scene is between O'Connell and Russell, on the morning after the picnic. Russell is expecting him to come to take her away to get married. He, however, had spent most of the night ruminating about how he was going to get out of it, while also protecting (in his apartment) Holden from the law who were looking for him. So, when O'Connell arrives at Russell's place, she rushes out and immediately assumes O'Connell is there to sweep her off her feet. The scene goes wild as all the women rush about to get Russell ready while poor O'Connell stands there, mute, simply unable or unwilling to cut through the noise to stop the stampede to his personal Armageddon in marriage. O'Connell's face goes through a wonderful variety of expressions that must be seen to be appreciated, but nevertheless, he goes off to his fate. Now, I wonder if O'Connell had studied Buster Keaton's silent exploits... Those three are worth seeing, for sure. As I said, however, the rest of the story is standard fare, albeit a quality production that shows off small town America, with all its contradictions (as in any culture); and despite what I think is a clunky, clich&eacute;d script, at times. But, Logan and his crew do it well, especially the photography from James Wong Howe, leaving this viewer with a movie that I'd watch again Â– well, those three scenes again, at least. Great stuff. I saw this movie back in 1956 or 1957 when it reached Australia. As I recall, I sort of liked it then, especially Novak. This was my second viewing; and I'm glad I did see it again. Give it a six out of ten. Recommended for all. February 28, 2012

    The drifter Hal Carter (William Holden) hitchhikes by train to a small town to visit the college friend Alan Benson (Cliff Robertson), who is the son of the industrialist Mr. Benson (Raymond Bailey) that is the wealthiest person in town. Hal asks for a small job to Ms. Helen Potts (Verna Felton) and the old lady feels affection for him and tells that nobody works in the Labor Day. She gives a breakfast to Hal and he meets her next door neighbor, the gorgeous Marjorie "Madge" Owens (Kim Novak) that is Alan's girlfriend. Then Hal is welcomed by Alan that invites him to go to the local picnic with Madge's younger sister Millie Owens (Susan Strasberg). Hal is a braggart, but attractive and gentle, and he becomes successful with the local girls. However, he falls in love with Madge and Alan feels betrayed by his best friend. "Picnic" is a dated and not believable romance, but also delightful to see. I saw this film for the first day on VHS on 29 January 2003 and in that occasion I liked it more than now.

When the spinster Rosemary (Rosalind Russell) has an argument with Hal and asks him to look himself in the mirror, William Holden is already an older man and the scene loses the impact. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "F&eacute;rias de Amor" ("Vacation of Love")

    This is a pedestrian melodrama that's saved by the great acting from William Holden, Arthur O'Connell, Rosalind Russell and newcomer (for that time) Susan Strasberg. The other major members of the cast perform well, but the core of the story revolves around those four plus the almost ineffable Kim Novak, an actress who'd been around for two/three years before appearing here. It was obvious that she was still learning how to act; however, she was perfect in the role as the girl who is too pretty. And, while Holden performed very well, when he starred in this at 37 he was hardly a young man (a much too lined face) who'd shared a college fraternity with Cliff Robertson (who was 31 or 32) who still managed to look in his mid-twenties for this movie. Holden, however, kept up the pretense and pulled it all off; more kudos to him Â– he had the body for it, anyway. The short synopsis on the main page says all you want to know about the story (boy meets girl); and I won't go into a long analysis of the plot or any of the social analysis. There are other reviews here with excellent accounts for you to read. Instead, I'd like to simply highlight some scenes in this story that are, I think, classicÂ… There are probably three, the first being the sizzling, sexy dance between Holden and Novak at the picnic. Holden, being the energetic show-off, starts to show the young Strasberg a new dance from LA. He tries to explain it, but she is inept at rhythm and moves away, allowing Holden to see Novak, across the floor, her eyes fixed on him as she begins a sensuous sashay down the stairs towards him, performing the dance moves perfectly. He is emotionally skewered; he can't take his eyes off her. They meet softly, slowly, eyes fixed on each other as they meld into an embrace, and glide about, together in their own universe. And, all with that 'Moonglow' theme pulsating in the sound track: hot stuff, pilgrim, for those days when the Hays Code still lurked in the wings. The second occurs soon after: Russell, fed up with her beau (Arthur O'Connell) and his lack of spunk and spark, grabs Holden from Novak and demands a dance: she is so emotionally and sexually frustrated Â– and a little tipsy Â– she loses self-control when Holden pulls away from her roughly, and tears his shirt nearly right off as she still clings to him. Shirt in tatters, exposed chest, Holden feels naked and staggers back; but, she now taunts him about his bragging, toughness and confidence. Verbally, she tears into him, stripping away his composure, and exposes him as the insecure, ignorant and inept wannabe that he is. Perhaps that was not only a cheap shot at lousy shirt manufacturing, but also another cheap slap in the face to Mr Hays. Hey, it worked for me. The final classic scene is between O'Connell and Russell, on the morning after the picnic. Russell is expecting him to come to take her away to get married. He, however, had spent most of the night ruminating about how he was going to get out of it, while also protecting (in his apartment) Holden from the law who were looking for him. So, when O'Connell arrives at Russell's place, she rushes out and immediately assumes O'Connell is there to sweep her off her feet. The scene goes wild as all the women rush about to get Russell ready while poor O'Connell stands there, mute, simply unable or unwilling to cut through the noise to stop the stampede to his personal Armageddon in marriage. O'Connell's face goes through a wonderful variety of expressions that must be seen to be appreciated, but nevertheless, he goes off to his fate. Now, I wonder if O'Connell had studied Buster Keaton's silent exploits... Those three are worth seeing, for sure. As I said, however, the rest of the story is standard fare, albeit a quality production that shows off small town America, with all its contradictions (as in any culture); and despite what I think is a clunky, clich&eacute;d script, at times. But, Logan and his crew do it well, especially the photography from James Wong Howe, leaving this viewer with a movie that I'd watch again Â– well, those three scenes again, at least. Great stuff. I saw this movie back in 1956 or 1957 when it reached Australia. As I recall, I sort of liked it then, especially Novak. This was my second viewing; and I'm glad I did see it again. Give it a six out of ten. Recommended for all. February 28, 2012

    This picture could be an artifact of the naive and childish romantic notions of the fifties and the plight of women at that time. The audience is asked to suspend reality on too many levels, the first being William Holden as a drop-dead gorgeous young stud. At 37, Holden was prematurely old from alcohol. Even with his shaved chest (which was supposed to make him look younger), he seems closer to 50. All of the gusto and even the lust are forced. Hal would have been an ideal role for Paul Newman or Marlon Brando at that time; maybe Joshua Logan just hated method actors. It would be understandable as to why Kim Novak, the Village Beauty, would dump the richest boy in town (Cliff Robertson) for a loser with no prospects. He would need to have overpowering sex appeal while Holden just appears used-up. In this situation, you can't help but feel for Betty Field's character who knows Madge's life will be a disaster once she marries Hal. The best outcome is that Madge will divorce him before she loses her looks. How audiences, at that time, could consider her union with Hal a happy ending is symptomatic of how delusional and pathetic the nineteen fifties were.

    Many fine scenes in this film make it one to see. Many fine performances as well. However, there are some scenes that are weak and performances in such scenes that aren't as strong as others. Some dialog that doesn't ring true, meaning that it doesn't seem as if it would actually be said that way in reality, but instead is merely a way to get to a point being made. So there are a few stodgy scenes that bring the film in whole down from greatness, to being very good. That doesn't mean it isn't a good film, as it is, just a few missteps along the way. This isn't due to the emotional yet illogical behavior of the leads. Of course, logically we know that the relationship for Hal and Maddie is pretty well doomed to fail just as her mother's did, but such is the nature of people in love, even with a love based upon first impression physical attraction. So the ending of the two lovers going to meet in Tulsa on separate transports is quite telling and foreboding. That in itself nearly wipes away all of the weak scenes.

    Picnic: Never saw it when it came out. Saw Kim Novak on special TCM interview show this week, she of 80 years and still looking wonderful. I DVR'd Picnic, and of course marveled at how young she was at the time this movie was made. No white hair for Kim. Her hair is still a beautiful blonde, and her 2012 clothing in the interview was very stylish. Holden looking wonderful. So what if he was so much older. Alan was his age, and nobody asked how many years after his college graduation. Holden a bum, a loser, with juvenile delinquent record must have been somewhat attractive qualities for Novak, since all she had to compare was goofy rich guy Alan or stupid paperboy Nick Adams. Susan Strasberg couldn't fool her mother with that smoking. Betty Field made a nice mother, and I remember her as Cassandra Tower from Kings Row. Mrs. Potts was very nice, and accepted Holden as he was, not comparing him to some local hometown Romeo. Kings Row was a small town where bad things happened. So was Peyton Place. So was Harmony on TV's Passions. Remember River City, Iowa, in the Music Man? River City's 'crimes' included things such as 'reading a dime novel in the corn crib.' Indeed, small town America has lots of shouldn'ts and secrets, and absolutely everyone knows everyone else's business. We have a particular small town in our state where people left their doors unlocked only ten years ago, but now their minimal crime leads to locked doors. Picnic was where a hot hunk, invited, arrives courtesy of a freight car, into a town in the middle of nowhere and proceeds to take the most beautiful young woman away from the high-rolling scion of the town's wealthy leader. During the actual picnic itself, food and desserts are only the precursors of the steamy evening to come. The Rosalind Russell part was way overdone. She was so desperate. Arthur O'Connell was probably married to his mother, and Roz must have ended up being a very shrewish daughter-in-law, if the mother was still alive. Roz begging Arthur to marry her was so corny, uncomfortable, stupid and dumb. She should have stayed on at the school, where at least the children may have returned her affections. Sticking out her tongue as she departed the school was the most terrible thing I saw her do. It's bye-bye lowly school paycheck, and hello O'Connell's self-employed monthly stipend with probably poverty for Roz and scrubbing those floors on her hands and knees to keep in favor with him -- since apparently he had no passion for her.

    A former college football star drifts into a small town on Labor Day, disrupting the lives of the locals. Director Logan came from a stage background and he never adapted to the film medium. He did not understand that film acting requires more subtlety than stage acting. Holden is certainly not known for overplaying, but Logan pushes him in that direction. He's not helped by some of his lines, particularly his repeatedly calling Novak "Baby." Yes, Inge's play won the Pulitzer Prize, but it is overly dramatic and contains some really corny lines. Russell is quite energetic. Novak, on the other hand, seems to be on a sedative. O'Connell and Strasberg come off best.

    Top rating of the film with one major flaw. This film was originally released in anamorphic (widescreen) and 4 track stereo. All of the DVD releases use pan-scan, which in today's world is ludicrous. You can view the widescreen on Netflix watch instantly when it is available, but if you buy or rent it in it's currently available versions, you get only half of the incredible cinematography. Why would they destroy such a wonderful film? I believe that in order to experience a film of this stature, one should at least be able to see all of what Joshua Logan intended. Aspect ratios aside, this film is a remarkable experience, especially the soundtrack by George Duning. Novak is perfect for the role, and to be realistic William Holden is a bit old for the role of Hal. The subplot romance between Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell just about steals the show. James Wong Howe's spectacular cinematography is the final touch to a really great Hollywood version of the Broadway play. Dated, yes, but still beautiful.

    Corny, old-fashioned, silly, heavy-handed moral messages, obviousÂ…yet it's still masterful. It is one of those pieces that is somehow separate from the sum of its parts. Does it even make sense that something this dated is still this great? Actually, it does. Despite a few very glaring flaws, the film is able to triumph over these setbacks and be great. Let us start with the cinematography, it is only second to perfection. Each scene has just the right amount of touch, just the right amount of editing, and just immaculate framing of shots. It is not some pretend to be great cinematography with amazing exotic landscapes or special effects or anything like that. It is technical diligence where whichever shot is required, be it wide shot, medium shot, two-shot or whatever, it is delivered. Each and every time. This is a film somehow directed to perfection (san the river bank scene, haha). I could continue on about the movie, how things are not preach, but thorough and purposeful, or how it doesn't have to try hard to be stylish, but succeeds in drawing you to its own world,or through all its unlikeliness offers very effective storytellingÂ… but I'd like to keep this review in the same light as the movieÂ…Trite, but true. So, if you are looking for an underrated and overlooked classic, skip "Night of the Hunter" and watch this. 9/10

    Absolutely masterful storytelling. Four story lines united by two beautiful melodies, which themselves are united. Four romance-related stories are intertwined: deepening love between Bill & Kim; painfully destroyed crush of teenager Strasberg; lost love of mother; lost romance ofï»¿ Roz Russel. All roles masterfully acted, with the exception of Bill's stiff dancing. That being said, there, on screen, are your mother and father, andï»¿ all their ancestors, and all your descendants. That's what life is about Â— simply that. By the way, this scene is definitive proof that free will does not exist. Bill didn'tï»¿ have a chance. Guys take note: When women say they want more romance in theirï»¿ lives, this is what they mean. It's worth a shot.

    Corny and hokey. This movie is an example of what can happen when a the storyline of a play is changed to conform to a movie format. What is a tight wrapped theatrical production morphs into something almost unrecognizable from the original on the screen. This movie can be best summed up in one word: hokey. True, the movie was made in 1955, but still, by that time Hollywood was already treating the subject of sex in a more candid manner. This movie takes a great play with a lot of intense interactions and transforms it into an overblown mess with a lot of stagy overacting. Despite the title of the play, the story is not about a picnic, yet the movie makes a picnic a central feature of the story, which diverts the audience's attention from what is going on between the principal characters, who get lost in the crowd. If any movie did not need extras, this is the one. Yet for some reason, this movie has an army of extras playing picnickers. William Holden's performance is good but not especially strong or overpowering and there is little chemistry between him and Kim Novak. Much more intense and better acted are the performances by Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell, both in supportive roles. The movie should have been about them.

    The drifter Hal Carter (William Holden) hitchhikes by train to a small town to visit the college friend Alan Benson (Cliff Robertson), who is the son of the industrialist Mr. Benson (Raymond Bailey) that is the wealthiest person in town. Hal asks for a small job to Ms. Helen Potts (Verna Felton) and the old lady feels affection for him and tells that nobody works in the Labor Day. She gives a breakfast to Hal and he meets her next door neighbor, the gorgeous Marjorie "Madge" Owens (Kim Novak) that is Alan's girlfriend. Then Hal is welcomed by Alan that invites him to go to the local picnic with Madge's younger sister Millie Owens (Susan Strasberg). Hal is a braggart, but attractive and gentle, and he becomes successful with the local girls. However, he falls in love with Madge and Alan feels betrayed by his best friend. "Picnic" is a dated and not believable romance, but also delightful to see. I saw this film for the first day on VHS on 29 January 2003 and in that occasion I liked it more than now. I have just seen this film again on DVD and I found the thirty-seven year old William Holden absolutely miscast in the role of a youngster of twenty and something years old. When the spinster Rosemary (Rosalind Russell) has an argument with Hal and asks him to look himself in the mirror, William Holden is already an older man and the scene loses the impact. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "F&eacute;rias de Amor" ("Vacation of Love")

    Corny, old-fashioned, silly, heavy-handed moral messages, obviousÂ…yet it's still masterful. It is one of those pieces that is somehow separate from the sum of its parts. Does it even make sense that something this dated is still this great? Actually, it does. Despite a few very glaring flaws, the film is able to triumph over these setbacks and be great. Let us start with the cinematography, it is only second to perfection. Each scene has just the right amount of touch, just the right amount of editing, and just immaculate framing of shots. It is not some pretend to be great cinematography with amazing exotic landscapes or special effects or anything like that. It is technical diligence where whichever shot is required, be it wide shot, medium shot, two-shot or whatever, it is delivered. Each and every time. This is a film somehow directed to perfection (san the river bank scene, haha). I could continue on about the movie, how things are not preach, but thorough and purposeful, or how it doesn't have to try hard to be stylish, but succeeds in drawing you to its own world,or through all its unlikeliness offers very effective storytellingÂ… but I'd like to keep this review in the same light as the movieÂ…Trite, but true. So, if you are looking for an underrated and overlooked classic, skip "Night of the Hunter" and watch this. 9/10

    Absolutely masterful storytelling. Four story lines united by two beautiful melodies, which themselves are united. Four romance-related stories are intertwined: deepening love between Bill & Kim; painfully destroyed crush of teenager Strasberg; lost love of mother; lost romance ofï»¿ Roz Russel. All roles masterfully acted, with the exception of Bill's stiff dancing. That being said, there, on screen, are your mother and father, andï»¿ all their ancestors, and all your descendants. That's what life is about Â— simply that. By the way, this scene is definitive proof that free will does not exist. Bill didn'tï»¿ have a chance. Guys take note: When women say they want more romance in theirï»¿ lives, this is what they mean. It's worth a shot.

    Corny and hokey. This movie is an example of what can happen when a the storyline of a play is changed to conform to a movie format. What is a tight wrapped theatrical production morphs into something almost unrecognizable from the original on the screen. This movie can be best summed up in one word: hokey. True, the movie was made in 1955, but still, by that time Hollywood was already treating the subject of sex in a more candid manner. This movie takes a great play with a lot of intense interactions and transforms it into an overblown mess with a lot of stagy overacting. Despite the title of the play, the story is not about a picnic, yet the movie makes a picnic a central feature of the story, which diverts the audience's attention from what is going on between the principal characters, who get lost in the crowd. If any movie did not need extras, this is the one. Yet for some reason, this movie has an army of extras playing picnickers. William Holden's performance is good but not especially strong or overpowering and there is little chemistry between him and Kim Novak. Much more intense and better acted are the performances by Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell, both in supportive roles. The movie should have been about them.

    The drifter Hal Carter (William Holden) hitchhikes by train to a small town to visit the college friend Alan Benson (Cliff Robertson), who is the son of the industrialist Mr. Benson (Raymond Bailey) that is the wealthiest person in town. Hal asks for a small job to Ms. Helen Potts (Verna Felton) and the old lady feels affection for him and tells that nobody works in the Labor Day. She gives a breakfast to Hal and he meets her next door neighbor, the gorgeous Marjorie "Madge" Owens (Kim Novak) that is Alan's girlfriend. Then Hal is welcomed by Alan that invites him to go to the local picnic with Madge's younger sister Millie Owens (Susan Strasberg). Hal is a braggart, but attractive and gentle, and he becomes successful with the local girls. However, he falls in love with Madge and Alan feels betrayed by his best friend. "Picnic" is a dated and not believable romance, but also delightful to see. I saw this film for the first day on VHS on 29 January 2003 and in that occasion I liked it more than now. I have just seen this film again on DVD and I found the thirty-seven year old William Holden absolutely miscast in the role of a youngster of twenty and something years old. When the spinster Rosemary (Rosalind Russell) has an argument with Hal and asks him to look himself in the mirror, William Holden is already an older man and the scene loses the impact. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "F&eacute;rias de Amor" ("Vacation of Love")

    This is a pedestrian melodrama that's saved by the great acting from William Holden, Arthur O'Connell, Rosalind Russell and newcomer (for that time) Susan Strasberg. The other major members of the cast perform well, but the core of the story revolves around those four plus the almost ineffable Kim Novak, an actress who'd been around for two/three years before appearing here. It was obvious that she was still learning how to act; however, she was perfect in the role as the girl who is too pretty. And, while Holden performed very well, when he starred in this at 37 he was hardly a young man (a much too lined face) who'd shared a college fraternity with Cliff Robertson (who was 31 or 32) who still managed to look in his mid-twenties for this movie. Holden, however, kept up the pretense and pulled it all off; more kudos to him Â– he had the body for it, anyway. The short synopsis on the main page says all you want to know about the story (boy meets girl); and I won't go into a long analysis of the plot or any of the social analysis. There are other reviews here with excellent accounts for you to read. Instead, I'd like to simply highlight some scenes in this story that are, I think, classicÂ… There are probably three, the first being the sizzling, sexy dance between Holden and Novak at the picnic. Holden, being the energetic show-off, starts to show the young Strasberg a new dance from LA. He tries to explain it, but she is inept at rhythm and moves away, allowing Holden to see Novak, across the floor, her eyes fixed on him as she begins a sensuous sashay down the stairs towards him, performing the dance moves perfectly. He is emotionally skewered; he can't take his eyes off her. They meet softly, slowly, eyes fixed on each other as they meld into an embrace, and glide about, together in their own universe. And, all with that 'Moonglow' theme pulsating in the sound track: hot stuff, pilgrim, for those days when the Hays Code still lurked in the wings. The second occurs soon after: Russell, fed up with her beau (Arthur O'Connell) and his lack of spunk and spark, grabs Holden from Novak and demands a dance: she is so emotionally and sexually frustrated Â– and a little tipsy Â– she loses self-control when Holden pulls away from her roughly, and tears his shirt nearly right off as she still clings to him. Shirt in tatters, exposed chest, Holden feels naked and staggers back; but, she now taunts him about his bragging, toughness and confidence. Verbally, she tears into him, stripping away his composure, and exposes him as the insecure, ignorant and inept wannabe that he is. Perhaps that was not only a cheap shot at lousy shirt manufacturing, but also another cheap slap in the face to Mr Hays. Hey, it worked for me. The final classic scene is between O'Connell and Russell, on the morning after the picnic. Russell is expecting him to come to take her away to get married. He, however, had spent most of the night ruminating about how he was going to get out of it, while also protecting (in his apartment) Holden from the law who were looking for him. So, when O'Connell arrives at Russell's place, she rushes out and immediately assumes O'Connell is there to sweep her off her feet. The scene goes wild as all the women rush about to get Russell ready while poor O'Connell stands there, mute, simply unable or unwilling to cut through the noise to stop the stampede to his personal Armageddon in marriage. O'Connell's face goes through a wonderful variety of expressions that must be seen to be appreciated, but nevertheless, he goes off to his fate. Now, I wonder if O'Connell had studied Buster Keaton's silent exploits... Those three are worth seeing, for sure. As I said, however, the rest of the story is standard fare, albeit a quality production that shows off small town America, with all its contradictions (as in any culture); and despite what I think is a clunky, clich&eacute;d script, at times. But, Logan and his crew do it well, especially the photography from James Wong Howe, leaving this viewer with a movie that I'd watch again Â– well, those three scenes again, at least. Great stuff. I saw this movie back in 1956 or 1957 when it reached Australia. As I recall, I sort of liked it then, especially Novak. This was my second viewing; and I'm glad I did see it again. Give it a six out of ten. Recommended for all. February 28, 2012

    This picture could be an artifact of the naive and childish romantic notions of the fifties and the plight of women at that time. The audience is asked to suspend reality on too many levels, the first being William Holden as a drop-dead gorgeous young stud. At 37, Holden was prematurely old from alcohol. Even with his shaved chest (which was supposed to make him look younger), he seems closer to 50. All of the gusto and even the lust are forced. Hal would have been an ideal role for Paul Newman or Marlon Brando at that time; maybe Joshua Logan just hated method actors. It would be understandable as to why Kim Novak, the Village Beauty, would dump the richest boy in town (Cliff Robertson) for a loser with no prospects. He would need to have overpowering sex appeal while Holden just appears used-up. In this situation, you can't help but feel for Betty Field's character who knows Madge's life will be a disaster once she marries Hal. The best outcome is that Madge will divorce him before she loses her looks. How audiences, at that time, could consider her union with Hal a happy ending is symptomatic of how delusional and pathetic the nineteen fifties were.

    Many fine scenes in this film make it one to see. Many fine performances as well. However, there are some scenes that are weak and performances in such scenes that aren't as strong as others. Some dialog that doesn't ring true, meaning that it doesn't seem as if it would actually be said that way in reality, but instead is merely a way to get to a point being made. So there are a few stodgy scenes that bring the film in whole down from greatness, to being very good. That doesn't mean it isn't a good film, as it is, just a few missteps along the way. This isn't due to the emotional yet illogical behavior of the leads. Of course, logically we know that the relationship for Hal and Maddie is pretty well doomed to fail just as her mother's did, but such is the nature of people in love, even with a love based upon first impression physical attraction. So the ending of the two lovers going to meet in Tulsa on separate transports is quite telling and foreboding. That in itself nearly wipes away all of the weak scenes.

    Picnic: Never saw it when it came out. Saw Kim Novak on special TCM interview show this week, she of 80 years and still looking wonderful. I DVR'd Picnic, and of course marveled at how young she was at the time this movie was made. No white hair for Kim. Her hair is still a beautiful blonde, and her 2012 clothing in the interview was very stylish. Holden looking wonderful. So what if he was so much older. Alan was his age, and nobody asked how many years after his college graduation. Holden a bum, a loser, with juvenile delinquent record must have been somewhat attractive qualities for Novak, since all she had to compare was goofy rich guy Alan or stupid paperboy Nick Adams. Susan Strasberg couldn't fool her mother with that smoking. Betty Field made a nice mother, and I remember her as Cassandra Tower from Kings Row. Mrs. Potts was very nice, and accepted Holden as he was, not comparing him to some local hometown Romeo. Kings Row was a small town where bad things happened. So was Peyton Place. So was Harmony on TV's Passions. Remember River City, Iowa, in the Music Man? River City's 'crimes' included things such as 'reading a dime novel in the corn crib.' Indeed, small town America has lots of shouldn'ts and secrets, and absolutely everyone knows everyone else's business. We have a particular small town in our state where people left their doors unlocked only ten years ago, but now their minimal crime leads to locked doors. Picnic was where a hot hunk, invited, arrives courtesy of a freight car, into a town in the middle of nowhere and proceeds to take the most beautiful young woman away from the high-rolling scion of the town's wealthy leader. During the actual picnic itself, food and desserts are only the precursors of the steamy evening to come. The Rosalind Russell part was way overdone. She was so desperate. Arthur O'Connell was probably married to his mother, and Roz must have ended up being a very shrewish daughter-in-law, if the mother was still alive. Roz begging Arthur to marry her was so corny, uncomfortable, stupid and dumb. She should have stayed on at the school, where at least the children may have returned her affections. Sticking out her tongue as she departed the school was the most terrible thing I saw her do. It's bye-bye lowly school paycheck, and hello O'Connell's self-employed monthly stipend with probably poverty for Roz and scrubbing those floors on her hands and knees to keep in favor with him -- since apparently he had no passion for her.

    A former college football star drifts into a small town on Labor Day, disrupting the lives of the locals. Director Logan came from a stage background and he never adapted to the film medium. He did not understand that film acting requires more subtlety than stage acting. Holden is certainly not known for overplaying, but Logan pushes him in that direction. He's not helped by some of his lines, particularly his repeatedly calling Novak "Baby." Yes, Inge's play won the Pulitzer Prize, but it is overly dramatic and contains some really corny lines. Russell is quite energetic. Novak, on the other hand, seems to be on a sedative. O'Connell and Strasberg come off best.

    Top rating of the film with one major flaw. This film was originally released in anamorphic (widescreen) and 4 track stereo. All of the DVD releases use pan-scan, which in today's world is ludicrous. You can view the widescreen on Netflix watch instantly when it is available, but if you buy or rent it in it's currently available versions, you get only half of the incredible cinematography. Why would they destroy such a wonderful film? I believe that in order to experience a film of this stature, one should at least be able to see all of what Joshua Logan intended. Aspect ratios aside, this film is a remarkable experience, especially the soundtrack by George Duning. Novak is perfect for the role, and to be realistic William Holden is a bit old for the role of Hal. The subplot romance between Rosalind Russell and Arthur O'Connell just about steals the show. James Wong Howe's spectacular cinematography is the final touch to a really great Hollywood version of the Broadway play. Dated, yes, but still beautiful.
