    In spite of too much blood and violent scenes, this film would be a great entertainment on a Friday night. I found it hard to relate this movie to "Horror" as it is tagged on IMDb: vampires are merely jokes, not even close to an actual threat. One of the funniest scene for this film is to watch how ineligible can a vampire be; it reminds me of some old time antiques like "monster squad". Come on, a vampire/werewolf that walks like an old man all the time? Sure the shooting techniques are very much limited by their time, but always I cannot help compare them to "underworld" and then conclude I probably should never watch a pure vampire film before 2000 again. Well this movie is not a pure vampire film, it's much more than that. You will see Quentin plays a psycho (I didn't know he could act), how a Vietnam veteran, a sex machine, a retired priest, a escaped thief and two kids slaughter a bunch of vampires in a bar called titty-twister, how Salma Hayek perform a half-naked dance with a snake on her, and how the thief become Dr. Phil for a priest. Lots of peoples and things died or vanished in the end, and most importantly, you will laugh our loud a lot.

    After a bank heist, brothers Richie and Seth Gecko plan to head to Mexico to evade arrest. At a motel, Richie kills their hostage and their journey hits a slump, but just when things could have gotten worse, the Fuller family shows up. Seth takes them hostage and the five successfully cross the border. They arrive at a bar called "The Titty Twister", where Seth will meet his handler in the morning. When the moon strikes, the workers in the bar turn into vampires and the survivors must soon fight for their lives..... Sometimes, its a shame that the Internet exists, and also, people who like to spoil film. If this was released in the eighties, this would have a Psycho essence to it. If you haven't seen the trailers for this, or know anything about the film, stop reading and just watch the film, it will be a surprise. Other than that, its a fine movie, Tarantino proves he cannot act, but Clooney proves he is a star in the making. He carries the film and steals every single scene from everyone else, thank heavens for this or Batman And Robin would have killed his career, he really is that good in this. The script is hilarious, Rodriguez proves he was a force to be reckoned with, and whole movie is what made Grindhouse. The opening sequence grips you, and never let's you go. But it all depends on the twist. If you swallow it, its probably one of the greats from 1996, if not, you'll probably hate it. But when it was released, the director, writer, and most of the cast were the hottest, most cult things on earth,so it may be a case of you really had to be there to appreciate it. Luckily I was, and I love returning to this film every now and again, because its fun and exciting, which is the fundamental element of cinema.

    When this film came out all I remember is that it was 'the' go to film for all things cool. The plot wasn't a surprise as the trailers pretty much gave everything away but the decade was still buzzing from Tarantino fever and after the superb 'Desperado' the teaming of Robert Rodriguez and his screen writing chum doing a film about vampires was too much pull for a 17 year old me. I can say without a doubt that it is a classic. Maybe not in the sense of Casablanca or Raiders Of The Lost Ark but as a style film it really can't be touched. Tarantino's screenplay drips with wit and humour as well as the usual taboo subjects thrown into everyday conversation and Rodriguez direction compliments this. Both men have made 'looking tacky' an art form when it comes to film and this heavily works in it's favour because we want it to feel sleazy and a bit dirty. Rodriguez has made some right stinkers in his time but in this era he was what I consider to be a proper fimmaker with no CGI and not much of a budget which pushes directors to be as creative as possible. The cast is about as good as it gets. George Cloony, who audiences were used to seeing as a respectable Doctor on the hit Series ER does a complete character 180 into the superb Seth Gecko a character with all the moral fibre of a rock and the patience of a 5 year old. He tears into the script like a hungry dog which showcases whole new side to Cloony's acting and who could forget 'that' tattoo, a tiny detail which really brought the visual impact of the character to life and has since been copied many times but back then it was a striking feature. It's probably safe to say that this film was a game changer for Cloony who gained new respect for such a radical change but sadly hasn't really done much else that comes close. As a few people have mentioned this is really two films in one, the first being a superb crime drama which sees the Gecko boys escape over the border with a kidnapped family, and the second is pure schlock nonsense and I am totally fine with that. Maybe it was the teenager in me when I saw this but nothing could make me or my pals smile more than a bit of blood, guts and vampires interlaced with ridiculous humour. Some say the vampire section brings the crime thriller down but I think the thriller part raises the profile of what is already a really cool film. So many people go by formulas, right ways to do things and rules. Where art is concerned and this includes film, music etc. there can only be guidelines and it's great to see a bunch of people making a film the way they want to make it and that means throwing whatever off beat, off topic nonsense they feel like into the mix just because they simply think it would be cool. A superb and sleazy trashcan of a movie that's not afraid to play with childish notions because it knows it's a cut above most film snobs polished favourites.

    Somehow I had not heard about this movie by Rodriguez and Tarantino, and I did not read anything about it before I started watching it. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Now, I am a big fan of Tarantino and a slightly lesser fan of Rodriguez but I love Sin City and Planet Terror among others. The First hour of the movie felt to me like a typical Tarantino movie, with witty and clever dialogue, a lot of violence, and in this case a hostage situation. I thought to myself... YESSS! I am totally going to enjoy this movie, and I sure did........ Then our characters arrive at a bar called the Titty Twister,(about and hour into the movie) and I did not expect the rest of the movie to take place there. But then out of no where.... VAMPIRES! And nothing but a couple of laughs and vampire slaying till the end credits roll. We never know why the vampires are there, I guess its suppose to be just... One of those things, it can happen to anyone hah! I think I might have enjoyed this movie for what it is, had I known beforehand this was i vampire movie. I just feel like they abandoned the story line of the first half when the vampires came. And I was in no way prepared. Overall, a great first half, brought down in my opinion by the shallow vampire packed second half. Well, I should have known I guess, this being a Rodriguez film. Im still giving the movie a 7/10 just because of the first half, could have gotten a higher grade had it gone in a different direction.

    I sat down to this movie with no preconceptions whatsoever, as had been recommended to me. This turned out to be very good advice, because it makes the twist in the middle a complete surprise, and therefore all the more enjoyable. (It is for this reason that I'm giving a spoiler warning, as even knowing there is a twist might rob people of that experience.) Essentially you're thrown from one movie into a completely different one, with the main characters as the only thread holding the two together. Almost the entire plot from the first 30 minutes is rendered irrelevant, which I thought was a great idea. Usually, you sort of know where a story is going. If the point is for the protagonist to travel to a volcano and throw a ring into it, you know they are going to be successful. You have some suspense of disbelief that allows you to still experience some fear when a perilous situation presents itself, but at a more "meta" level you know what Frodo isn't going to die in the first book/film. This movie takes that expectation and punches it in the face. Unfortunately, though, the concept is not carried to a satisfying end. After the monsters are let loose, there are about 10 minutes where the movie is able to ride the absurdity of this gear shift, but then finds itself stuck with a bunch of vampires to get rid of, and a plot to tie a knot in. And through the insistence to pay homage to cheap gore movies, the tension arcs that were built up in the first half of the movie are deflated without pay-off, and the relationships between the characters are essentially reset. This robs the movie of a connection between the two stories, as well as a proper resolution. Still, it's an entertaining 90 minutes and a must-see cult classic.

    It's interesting to see these young Film maverick's at work. Shot, Cut, and Directed by Robert Rodriguez and written by Quentin Tarantino. In this early effort you can see many a thing that will become trademarks. But one must say this is far from either one's best. It is like a workout, flexing the muscles and developing the chops. There are some glorious bits here and there is enough to satisfy Film Geeks and the lovers of Drive-In/Grindhouse Flicks because that is where this colorful, violent, trashy, thing comes from. Like most Rodriquez stuff you have to bring a strong stomach and be ready for some outrageous goings-on. There is a perverted gory atmosphere and some darkly funny Tarantino dialog and the make-up and SFX are quite good. This was Clooney's big screen debut and he doesn't disappoint. The rest of the Cult Movie cast, are also along for the ride and seem to be having a grand old time. It's a loud and wild event and if you go with it there may be some eclectic enjoyment but may have some scurrying for the exits.

    A gangster/vampire hybrid masterpiece!!! I saw the film when it first came out, about 16 years ago now, back at the time people didn't know it was a vampire flick until they saw it! Nowadays, most people are aware of this even if they haven't seen it, which certainly takes the surprise element away when you watch it which for me was a big part of it. I remember when Salma Hayek first turned into a vampire during the film, I thought up until that point it was your good yet typical gangster film, how wrong was I!! The film is full of funny one liners, mostly delivered by George Clooney. Other main stars are Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Danny Trejo, Salma Hayek & Cheech (who actually plays 3 different parts in the film). My only problem with the film was Ernest Liu, who plays Scott - his acting skills were......lets say "not great".... I like the end when Juliette Lewis drives the RV away - the camera pans back to reveal that the "Titty Twister" bar is the top of an Aztec temple, obviously the source and true home of the vampires! DO NOT bother watching From Dusk Till Dawn 2 or 3, they are both really, really terrible films!!! To conclude, From Dusk Till Dawn is gory, funny - a fantastic film!! One of my all time favourites.

    you read my title summary of my review of this epic trash can classic. the cast was bad as i know it story was going good but out of nowhere i wasn't expecting the horror & Dracula stuff in the film.this is so embarrassing to watch as the film includes a guy talking about pussy & pussy all the time.we all know he was not talking about a cat Tarantino is a big fool who makes cheap films his pulp fiction was funny but his most films are about sex,abusive language & mindless action. this film is a great example of how sick minded people live in this world plus on top of that Hollywood makes crap like this & people praise them. i mean wow this is a shameless film.forget George colony as he sucks at acting but what was salma hayek doing there man on man she was naked dancing & eating people,the most disgusting thing she was doing. my rating for from dust till dawn is 1/10/pure awful film if you don't have any shame & morals left then this is for you.

    From the very first scene in this movie, I was hooked, and I could tell this was going to be a good and enjoyable film. And of course I was right. The story is pretty simple, but how it unfolds is the best part. It starts off as a crime drama. The dialogue is done in the usual Tarantino way. A lot of funny lines. The transition in the middle of the film was well done. One minute the Gecko brothers are having a good time, the next it's a complete splatter house. The Gecko brothers were fun to watch, and equally as amusing to listen to. Harvey Keitel's part was well played, same with the kids. Rodriguez regulars(Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin) are here as well. Even if they had a small part. Tom Savini is also present and he has some pretty funny moments as well. The fist half was a interesting crime drama, if it was like that the whole time I wouldn't have complained. The second have is all out mayhem and violence, loads of special effects. I highly recommend this, genre's were blended just right, and it leaves you satisfied after the credits roll. Rodriguez and Tarantino work well together.

In this early effort you can see many a thing that will become trademarks. But one must say this is far from either one's best. It is like a workout, flexing the muscles and developing the chops. There are some glorious bits here and there is enough to satisfy Film Geeks and the lovers of Drive-In/Grindhouse Flicks because that is where this colorful, violent, trashy, thing comes from. Like most Rodriquez stuff you have to bring a strong stomach and be ready for some outrageous goings-on. There is a perverted gory atmosphere and some darkly funny Tarantino dialog and the make-up and SFX are quite good. This was Clooney's big screen debut and he doesn't disappoint. The rest of the Cult Movie cast, are also along for the ride and seem to be having a grand old time. It's a loud and wild event and if you go with it there may be some eclectic enjoyment but may have some scurrying for the exits.

    A gangster/vampire hybrid masterpiece!!! I saw the film when it first came out, about 16 years ago now, back at the time people didn't know it was a vampire flick until they saw it! Nowadays, most people are aware of this even if they haven't seen it, which certainly takes the surprise element away when you watch it which for me was a big part of it. I remember when Salma Hayek first turned into a vampire during the film, I thought up until that point it was your good yet typical gangster film, how wrong was I!! The film is full of funny one liners, mostly delivered by George Clooney. Other main stars are Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Danny Trejo, Salma Hayek & Cheech (who actually plays 3 different parts in the film). My only problem with the film was Ernest Liu, who plays Scott - his acting skills were......lets say "not great".... I like the end when Juliette Lewis drives the RV away - the camera pans back to reveal that the "Titty Twister" bar is the top of an Aztec temple, obviously the source and true home of the vampires! DO NOT bother watching From Dusk Till Dawn 2 or 3, they are both really, really terrible films!!! To conclude, From Dusk Till Dawn is gory, funny - a fantastic film!! One of my all time favourites.

    you read my title summary of my review of this epic trash can classic. the cast was bad as i know it story was going good but out of nowhere i wasn't expecting the horror & Dracula stuff in the film.this is so embarrassing to watch as the film includes a guy talking about pussy & pussy all the time.we all know he was not talking about a cat Tarantino is a big fool who makes cheap films his pulp fiction was funny but his most films are about sex,abusive language & mindless action. this film is a great example of how sick minded people live in this world plus on top of that Hollywood makes crap like this & people praise them. i mean wow this is a shameless film.forget George colony as he sucks at acting but what was salma hayek doing there man on man she was naked dancing & eating people,the most disgusting thing she was doing. my rating for from dust till dawn is 1/10/pure awful film if you don't have any shame & morals left then this is for you.

    From the very first scene in this movie, I was hooked, and I could tell this was going to be a good and enjoyable film. And of course I was right. The story is pretty simple, but how it unfolds is the best part. It starts off as a crime drama. The dialogue is done in the usual Tarantino way. A lot of funny lines. The transition in the middle of the film was well done. One minute the Gecko brothers are having a good time, the next it's a complete splatter house. The Gecko brothers were fun to watch, and equally as amusing to listen to. Harvey Keitel's part was well played, same with the kids. Rodriguez regulars(Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin) are here as well. Even if they had a small part. Tom Savini is also present and he has some pretty funny moments as well. The fist half was a interesting crime drama, if it was like that the whole time I wouldn't have complained. The second have is all out mayhem and violence, loads of special effects. I highly recommend this, genre's were blended just right, and it leaves you satisfied after the credits roll. Rodriguez and Tarantino work well together.

    In spite of too much blood and violent scenes, this film would be a great entertainment on a Friday night. I found it hard to relate this movie to "Horror" as it is tagged on IMDb: vampires are merely jokes, not even close to an actual threat. One of the funniest scene for this film is to watch how ineligible can a vampire be; it reminds me of some old time antiques like "monster squad". Come on, a vampire/werewolf that walks like an old man all the time? Sure the shooting techniques are very much limited by their time, but always I cannot help compare them to "underworld" and then conclude I probably should never watch a pure vampire film before 2000 again. Well this movie is not a pure vampire film, it's much more than that. You will see Quentin plays a psycho (I didn't know he could act), how a Vietnam veteran, a sex machine, a retired priest, a escaped thief and two kids slaughter a bunch of vampires in a bar called titty-twister, how Salma Hayek perform a half-naked dance with a snake on her, and how the thief become Dr. Phil for a priest. Lots of peoples and things died or vanished in the end, and most importantly, you will laugh our loud a lot.

    After a bank heist, brothers Richie and Seth Gecko plan to head to Mexico to evade arrest. At a motel, Richie kills their hostage and their journey hits a slump, but just when things could have gotten worse, the Fuller family shows up. Seth takes them hostage and the five successfully cross the border. They arrive at a bar called "The Titty Twister", where Seth will meet his handler in the morning. When the moon strikes, the workers in the bar turn into vampires and the survivors must soon fight for their lives..... Sometimes, its a shame that the Internet exists, and also, people who like to spoil film. If this was released in the eighties, this would have a Psycho essence to it. If you haven't seen the trailers for this, or know anything about the film, stop reading and just watch the film, it will be a surprise. Other than that, its a fine movie, Tarantino proves he cannot act, but Clooney proves he is a star in the making. He carries the film and steals every single scene from everyone else, thank heavens for this or Batman And Robin would have killed his career, he really is that good in this. The script is hilarious, Rodriguez proves he was a force to be reckoned with, and whole movie is what made Grindhouse. The opening sequence grips you, and never let's you go. But it all depends on the twist. If you swallow it, its probably one of the greats from 1996, if not, you'll probably hate it. But when it was released, the director, writer, and most of the cast were the hottest, most cult things on earth,so it may be a case of you really had to be there to appreciate it. Luckily I was, and I love returning to this film every now and again, because its fun and exciting, which is the fundamental element of cinema.

    When this film came out all I remember is that it was 'the' go to film for all things cool. The plot wasn't a surprise as the trailers pretty much gave everything away but the decade was still buzzing from Tarantino fever and after the superb 'Desperado' the teaming of Robert Rodriguez and his screen writing chum doing a film about vampires was too much pull for a 17 year old me. I can say without a doubt that it is a classic. Maybe not in the sense of Casablanca or Raiders Of The Lost Ark but as a style film it really can't be touched. Tarantino's screenplay drips with wit and humour as well as the usual taboo subjects thrown into everyday conversation and Rodriguez direction compliments this. Both men have made 'looking tacky' an art form when it comes to film and this heavily works in it's favour because we want it to feel sleazy and a bit dirty. Rodriguez has made some right stinkers in his time but in this era he was what I consider to be a proper fimmaker with no CGI and not much of a budget which pushes directors to be as creative as possible. The cast is about as good as it gets. George Cloony, who audiences were used to seeing as a respectable Doctor on the hit Series ER does a complete character 180 into the superb Seth Gecko a character with all the moral fibre of a rock and the patience of a 5 year old. He tears into the script like a hungry dog which showcases whole new side to Cloony's acting and who could forget 'that' tattoo, a tiny detail which really brought the visual impact of the character to life and has since been copied many times but back then it was a striking feature. It's probably safe to say that this film was a game changer for Cloony who gained new respect for such a radical change but sadly hasn't really done much else that comes close. As a few people have mentioned this is really two films in one, the first being a superb crime drama which sees the Gecko boys escape over the border with a kidnapped family, and the second is pure schlock nonsense and I am totally fine with that. Maybe it was the teenager in me when I saw this but nothing could make me or my pals smile more than a bit of blood, guts and vampires interlaced with ridiculous humour. Some say the vampire section brings the crime thriller down but I think the thriller part raises the profile of what is already a really cool film. So many people go by formulas, right ways to do things and rules. Where art is concerned and this includes film, music etc. there can only be guidelines and it's great to see a bunch of people making a film the way they want to make it and that means throwing whatever off beat, off topic nonsense they feel like into the mix just because they simply think it would be cool. A superb and sleazy trashcan of a movie that's not afraid to play with childish notions because it knows it's a cut above most film snobs polished favourites.

    Somehow I had not heard about this movie by Rodriguez and Tarantino, and I did not read anything about it before I started watching it. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Now, I am a big fan of Tarantino and a slightly lesser fan of Rodriguez but I love Sin City and Planet Terror among others. The First hour of the movie felt to me like a typical Tarantino movie, with witty and clever dialogue, a lot of violence, and in this case a hostage situation. I thought to myself... YESSS! I am totally going to enjoy this movie, and I sure did........ Then our characters arrive at a bar called the Titty Twister,(about and hour into the movie) and I did not expect the rest of the movie to take place there. But then out of no where.... VAMPIRES! And nothing but a couple of laughs and vampire slaying till the end credits roll. We never know why the vampires are there, I guess its suppose to be just... One of those things, it can happen to anyone hah! I think I might have enjoyed this movie for what it is, had I known beforehand this was i vampire movie. I just feel like they abandoned the story line of the first half when the vampires came. And I was in no way prepared. Overall, a great first half, brought down in my opinion by the shallow vampire packed second half. Well, I should have known I guess, this being a Rodriguez film. Im still giving the movie a 7/10 just because of the first half, could have gotten a higher grade had it gone in a different direction.

    I sat down to this movie with no preconceptions whatsoever, as had been recommended to me. This turned out to be very good advice, because it makes the twist in the middle a complete surprise, and therefore all the more enjoyable. (It is for this reason that I'm giving a spoiler warning, as even knowing there is a twist might rob people of that experience.) Essentially you're thrown from one movie into a completely different one, with the main characters as the only thread holding the two together. Almost the entire plot from the first 30 minutes is rendered irrelevant, which I thought was a great idea. Usually, you sort of know where a story is going. If the point is for the protagonist to travel to a volcano and throw a ring into it, you know they are going to be successful. You have some suspense of disbelief that allows you to still experience some fear when a perilous situation presents itself, but at a more "meta" level you know what Frodo isn't going to die in the first book/film. This movie takes that expectation and punches it in the face. Unfortunately, though, the concept is not carried to a satisfying end. After the monsters are let loose, there are about 10 minutes where the movie is able to ride the absurdity of this gear shift, but then finds itself stuck with a bunch of vampires to get rid of, and a plot to tie a knot in. And through the insistence to pay homage to cheap gore movies, the tension arcs that were built up in the first half of the movie are deflated without pay-off, and the relationships between the characters are essentially reset. This robs the movie of a connection between the two stories, as well as a proper resolution. Still, it's an entertaining 90 minutes and a must-see cult classic.

    It's interesting to see these young Film maverick's at work. Shot, Cut, and Directed by Robert Rodriguez and written by Quentin Tarantino. In this early effort you can see many a thing that will become trademarks. But one must say this is far from either one's best. It is like a workout, flexing the muscles and developing the chops. There are some glorious bits here and there is enough to satisfy Film Geeks and the lovers of Drive-In/Grindhouse Flicks because that is where this colorful, violent, trashy, thing comes from. Like most Rodriquez stuff you have to bring a strong stomach and be ready for some outrageous goings-on. There is a perverted gory atmosphere and some darkly funny Tarantino dialog and the make-up and SFX are quite good. This was Clooney's big screen debut and he doesn't disappoint. The rest of the Cult Movie cast, are also along for the ride and seem to be having a grand old time. It's a loud and wild event and if you go with it there may be some eclectic enjoyment but may have some scurrying for the exits.

Overall, a great first half, brought down in my opinion by the shallow vampire packed second half. Well, I should have known I guess, this being a Rodriguez film. Im still giving the movie a 7/10 just because of the first half, could have gotten a higher grade had it gone in a different direction.

    I sat down to this movie with no preconceptions whatsoever, as had been recommended to me. This turned out to be very good advice, because it makes the twist in the middle a complete surprise, and therefore all the more enjoyable. (It is for this reason that I'm giving a spoiler warning, as even knowing there is a twist might rob people of that experience.) Essentially you're thrown from one movie into a completely different one, with the main characters as the only thread holding the two together. Almost the entire plot from the first 30 minutes is rendered irrelevant, which I thought was a great idea. Usually, you sort of know where a story is going. If the point is for the protagonist to travel to a volcano and throw a ring into it, you know they are going to be successful. You have some suspense of disbelief that allows you to still experience some fear when a perilous situation presents itself, but at a more "meta" level you know what Frodo isn't going to die in the first book/film. This movie takes that expectation and punches it in the face. Unfortunately, though, the concept is not carried to a satisfying end. After the monsters are let loose, there are about 10 minutes where the movie is able to ride the absurdity of this gear shift, but then finds itself stuck with a bunch of vampires to get rid of, and a plot to tie a knot in. And through the insistence to pay homage to cheap gore movies, the tension arcs that were built up in the first half of the movie are deflated without pay-off, and the relationships between the characters are essentially reset. This robs the movie of a connection between the two stories, as well as a proper resolution. Still, it's an entertaining 90 minutes and a must-see cult classic.

    It's interesting to see these young Film maverick's at work. Shot, Cut, and Directed by Robert Rodriguez and written by Quentin Tarantino. In this early effort you can see many a thing that will become trademarks. But one must say this is far from either one's best. It is like a workout, flexing the muscles and developing the chops. There are some glorious bits here and there is enough to satisfy Film Geeks and the lovers of Drive-In/Grindhouse Flicks because that is where this colorful, violent, trashy, thing comes from. Like most Rodriquez stuff you have to bring a strong stomach and be ready for some outrageous goings-on. There is a perverted gory atmosphere and some darkly funny Tarantino dialog and the make-up and SFX are quite good. This was Clooney's big screen debut and he doesn't disappoint. The rest of the Cult Movie cast, are also along for the ride and seem to be having a grand old time. It's a loud and wild event and if you go with it there may be some eclectic enjoyment but may have some scurrying for the exits.

    A gangster/vampire hybrid masterpiece!!! I saw the film when it first came out, about 16 years ago now, back at the time people didn't know it was a vampire flick until they saw it! Nowadays, most people are aware of this even if they haven't seen it, which certainly takes the surprise element away when you watch it which for me was a big part of it. I remember when Salma Hayek first turned into a vampire during the film, I thought up until that point it was your good yet typical gangster film, how wrong was I!! The film is full of funny one liners, mostly delivered by George Clooney. Other main stars are Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Danny Trejo, Salma Hayek & Cheech (who actually plays 3 different parts in the film). My only problem with the film was Ernest Liu, who plays Scott - his acting skills were......lets say "not great".... I like the end when Juliette Lewis drives the RV away - the camera pans back to reveal that the "Titty Twister" bar is the top of an Aztec temple, obviously the source and true home of the vampires! DO NOT bother watching From Dusk Till Dawn 2 or 3, they are both really, really terrible films!!! To conclude, From Dusk Till Dawn is gory, funny - a fantastic film!! One of my all time favourites.

    you read my title summary of my review of this epic trash can classic. the cast was bad as i know it story was going good but out of nowhere i wasn't expecting the horror & Dracula stuff in the film.this is so embarrassing to watch as the film includes a guy talking about pussy & pussy all the time.we all know he was not talking about a cat Tarantino is a big fool who makes cheap films his pulp fiction was funny but his most films are about sex,abusive language & mindless action. this film is a great example of how sick minded people live in this world plus on top of that Hollywood makes crap like this & people praise them. i mean wow this is a shameless film.forget George colony as he sucks at acting but what was salma hayek doing there man on man she was naked dancing & eating people,the most disgusting thing she was doing. my rating for from dust till dawn is 1/10/pure awful film if you don't have any shame & morals left then this is for you.

    From the very first scene in this movie, I was hooked, and I could tell this was going to be a good and enjoyable film. And of course I was right. The story is pretty simple, but how it unfolds is the best part. It starts off as a crime drama. The dialogue is done in the usual Tarantino way. A lot of funny lines. The transition in the middle of the film was well done. One minute the Gecko brothers are having a good time, the next it's a complete splatter house. The Gecko brothers were fun to watch, and equally as amusing to listen to. Harvey Keitel's part was well played, same with the kids. Rodriguez regulars(Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin) are here as well. Even if they had a small part. Tom Savini is also present and he has some pretty funny moments as well. The fist half was a interesting crime drama, if it was like that the whole time I wouldn't have complained. The second have is all out mayhem and violence, loads of special effects. I highly recommend this, genre's were blended just right, and it leaves you satisfied after the credits roll. Rodriguez and Tarantino work well together.

    In spite of too much blood and violent scenes, this film would be a great entertainment on a Friday night. I found it hard to relate this movie to "Horror" as it is tagged on IMDb: vampires are merely jokes, not even close to an actual threat. One of the funniest scene for this film is to watch how ineligible can a vampire be; it reminds me of some old time antiques like "monster squad". Come on, a vampire/werewolf that walks like an old man all the time? Sure the shooting techniques are very much limited by their time, but always I cannot help compare them to "underworld" and then conclude I probably should never watch a pure vampire film before 2000 again. Well this movie is not a pure vampire film, it's much more than that. You will see Quentin plays a psycho (I didn't know he could act), how a Vietnam veteran, a sex machine, a retired priest, a escaped thief and two kids slaughter a bunch of vampires in a bar called titty-twister, how Salma Hayek perform a half-naked dance with a snake on her, and how the thief become Dr. Phil for a priest. Lots of peoples and things died or vanished in the end, and most importantly, you will laugh our loud a lot.

    After a bank heist, brothers Richie and Seth Gecko plan to head to Mexico to evade arrest. At a motel, Richie kills their hostage and their journey hits a slump, but just when things could have gotten worse, the Fuller family shows up. Seth takes them hostage and the five successfully cross the border. They arrive at a bar called "The Titty Twister", where Seth will meet his handler in the morning. When the moon strikes, the workers in the bar turn into vampires and the survivors must soon fight for their lives..... Sometimes, its a shame that the Internet exists, and also, people who like to spoil film. If this was released in the eighties, this would have a Psycho essence to it. If you haven't seen the trailers for this, or know anything about the film, stop reading and just watch the film, it will be a surprise. Other than that, its a fine movie, Tarantino proves he cannot act, but Clooney proves he is a star in the making. He carries the film and steals every single scene from everyone else, thank heavens for this or Batman And Robin would have killed his career, he really is that good in this. The script is hilarious, Rodriguez proves he was a force to be reckoned with, and whole movie is what made Grindhouse. The opening sequence grips you, and never let's you go. But it all depends on the twist. If you swallow it, its probably one of the greats from 1996, if not, you'll probably hate it. But when it was released, the director, writer, and most of the cast were the hottest, most cult things on earth,so it may be a case of you really had to be there to appreciate it. Luckily I was, and I love returning to this film every now and again, because its fun and exciting, which is the fundamental element of cinema.

    When this film came out all I remember is that it was 'the' go to film for all things cool. The plot wasn't a surprise as the trailers pretty much gave everything away but the decade was still buzzing from Tarantino fever and after the superb 'Desperado' the teaming of Robert Rodriguez and his screen writing chum doing a film about vampires was too much pull for a 17 year old me. I can say without a doubt that it is a classic. Maybe not in the sense of Casablanca or Raiders Of The Lost Ark but as a style film it really can't be touched. Tarantino's screenplay drips with wit and humour as well as the usual taboo subjects thrown into everyday conversation and Rodriguez direction compliments this. Both men have made 'looking tacky' an art form when it comes to film and this heavily works in it's favour because we want it to feel sleazy and a bit dirty. Rodriguez has made some right stinkers in his time but in this era he was what I consider to be a proper fimmaker with no CGI and not much of a budget which pushes directors to be as creative as possible. The cast is about as good as it gets. George Cloony, who audiences were used to seeing as a respectable Doctor on the hit Series ER does a complete character 180 into the superb Seth Gecko a character with all the moral fibre of a rock and the patience of a 5 year old. He tears into the script like a hungry dog which showcases whole new side to Cloony's acting and who could forget 'that' tattoo, a tiny detail which really brought the visual impact of the character to life and has since been copied many times but back then it was a striking feature. It's probably safe to say that this film was a game changer for Cloony who gained new respect for such a radical change but sadly hasn't really done much else that comes close. As a few people have mentioned this is really two films in one, the first being a superb crime drama which sees the Gecko boys escape over the border with a kidnapped family, and the second is pure schlock nonsense and I am totally fine with that. Maybe it was the teenager in me when I saw this but nothing could make me or my pals smile more than a bit of blood, guts and vampires interlaced with ridiculous humour. Some say the vampire section brings the crime thriller down but I think the thriller part raises the profile of what is already a really cool film. So many people go by formulas, right ways to do things and rules. Where art is concerned and this includes film, music etc. there can only be guidelines and it's great to see a bunch of people making a film the way they want to make it and that means throwing whatever off beat, off topic nonsense they feel like into the mix just because they simply think it would be cool. A superb and sleazy trashcan of a movie that's not afraid to play with childish notions because it knows it's a cut above most film snobs polished favourites.

    Somehow I had not heard about this movie by Rodriguez and Tarantino, and I did not read anything about it before I started watching it. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Now, I am a big fan of Tarantino and a slightly lesser fan of Rodriguez but I love Sin City and Planet Terror among others. The First hour of the movie felt to me like a typical Tarantino movie, with witty and clever dialogue, a lot of violence, and in this case a hostage situation. I thought to myself... YESSS! I am totally going to enjoy this movie, and I sure did........ Then our characters arrive at a bar called the Titty Twister,(about and hour into the movie) and I did not expect the rest of the movie to take place there. But then out of no where.... VAMPIRES! And nothing but a couple of laughs and vampire slaying till the end credits roll. We never know why the vampires are there, I guess its suppose to be just... One of those things, it can happen to anyone hah! I think I might have enjoyed this movie for what it is, had I known beforehand this was i vampire movie. I just feel like they abandoned the story line of the first half when the vampires came. And I was in no way prepared. Overall, a great first half, brought down in my opinion by the shallow vampire packed second half. Well, I should have known I guess, this being a Rodriguez film. Im still giving the movie a 7/10 just because of the first half, could have gotten a higher grade had it gone in a different direction.

In this early effort you can see many a thing that will become trademarks. But one must say this is far from either one's best. It is like a workout, flexing the muscles and developing the chops. There are some glorious bits here and there is enough to satisfy Film Geeks and the lovers of Drive-In/Grindhouse Flicks because that is where this colorful, violent, trashy, thing comes from. Like most Rodriquez stuff you have to bring a strong stomach and be ready for some outrageous goings-on.

He tears into the script like a hungry dog which showcases whole new side to Cloony's acting and who could forget 'that' tattoo, a tiny detail which really brought the visual impact of the character to life and has since been copied many times but back then it was a striking feature. It's probably safe to say that this film was a game changer for Cloony who gained new respect for such a radical change but sadly hasn't really done much else that comes close. As a few people have mentioned this is really two films in one, the first being a superb crime drama which sees the Gecko boys escape over the border with a kidnapped family, and the second is pure schlock nonsense and I am totally fine with that. Maybe it was the teenager in me when I saw this but nothing could make me or my pals smile more than a bit of blood, guts and vampires interlaced with ridiculous humour. Some say the vampire section brings the crime thriller down but I think the thriller part raises the profile of what is already a really cool film. So many people go by formulas, right ways to do things and rules. Where art is concerned and this includes film, music etc. there can only be guidelines and it's great to see a bunch of people making a film the way they want to make it and that means throwing whatever off beat, off topic nonsense they feel like into the mix just because they simply think it would be cool. A superb and sleazy trashcan of a movie that's not afraid to play with childish notions because it knows it's a cut above most film snobs polished favourites.

    Somehow I had not heard about this movie by Rodriguez and Tarantino, and I did not read anything about it before I started watching it. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Now, I am a big fan of Tarantino and a slightly lesser fan of Rodriguez but I love Sin City and Planet Terror among others. The First hour of the movie felt to me like a typical Tarantino movie, with witty and clever dialogue, a lot of violence, and in this case a hostage situation. I thought to myself... YESSS! I am totally going to enjoy this movie, and I sure did........ Then our characters arrive at a bar called the Titty Twister,(about and hour into the movie) and I did not expect the rest of the movie to take place there. But then out of no where.... VAMPIRES! And nothing but a couple of laughs and vampire slaying till the end credits roll. We never know why the vampires are there, I guess its suppose to be just... One of those things, it can happen to anyone hah! I think I might have enjoyed this movie for what it is, had I known beforehand this was i vampire movie. I just feel like they abandoned the story line of the first half when the vampires came. And I was in no way prepared. Overall, a great first half, brought down in my opinion by the shallow vampire packed second half. Well, I should have known I guess, this being a Rodriguez film. Im still giving the movie a 7/10 just because of the first half, could have gotten a higher grade had it gone in a different direction.

    I sat down to this movie with no preconceptions whatsoever, as had been recommended to me. This turned out to be very good advice, because it makes the twist in the middle a complete surprise, and therefore all the more enjoyable. (It is for this reason that I'm giving a spoiler warning, as even knowing there is a twist might rob people of that experience.) Essentially you're thrown from one movie into a completely different one, with the main characters as the only thread holding the two together. Almost the entire plot from the first 30 minutes is rendered irrelevant, which I thought was a great idea. Usually, you sort of know where a story is going. If the point is for the protagonist to travel to a volcano and throw a ring into it, you know they are going to be successful. You have some suspense of disbelief that allows you to still experience some fear when a perilous situation presents itself, but at a more "meta" level you know what Frodo isn't going to die in the first book/film. This movie takes that expectation and punches it in the face. Unfortunately, though, the concept is not carried to a satisfying end. After the monsters are let loose, there are about 10 minutes where the movie is able to ride the absurdity of this gear shift, but then finds itself stuck with a bunch of vampires to get rid of, and a plot to tie a knot in. And through the insistence to pay homage to cheap gore movies, the tension arcs that were built up in the first half of the movie are deflated without pay-off, and the relationships between the characters are essentially reset. This robs the movie of a connection between the two stories, as well as a proper resolution. Still, it's an entertaining 90 minutes and a must-see cult classic.

    It's interesting to see these young Film maverick's at work. Shot, Cut, and Directed by Robert Rodriguez and written by Quentin Tarantino. In this early effort you can see many a thing that will become trademarks. But one must say this is far from either one's best. It is like a workout, flexing the muscles and developing the chops. There are some glorious bits here and there is enough to satisfy Film Geeks and the lovers of Drive-In/Grindhouse Flicks because that is where this colorful, violent, trashy, thing comes from. Like most Rodriquez stuff you have to bring a strong stomach and be ready for some outrageous goings-on. There is a perverted gory atmosphere and some darkly funny Tarantino dialog and the make-up and SFX are quite good. This was Clooney's big screen debut and he doesn't disappoint. The rest of the Cult Movie cast, are also along for the ride and seem to be having a grand old time. It's a loud and wild event and if you go with it there may be some eclectic enjoyment but may have some scurrying for the exits.

    A gangster/vampire hybrid masterpiece!!! I saw the film when it first came out, about 16 years ago now, back at the time people didn't know it was a vampire flick until they saw it! Nowadays, most people are aware of this even if they haven't seen it, which certainly takes the surprise element away when you watch it which for me was a big part of it. I remember when Salma Hayek first turned into a vampire during the film, I thought up until that point it was your good yet typical gangster film, how wrong was I!! The film is full of funny one liners, mostly delivered by George Clooney. Other main stars are Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Danny Trejo, Salma Hayek & Cheech (who actually plays 3 different parts in the film). My only problem with the film was Ernest Liu, who plays Scott - his acting skills were......lets say "not great".... I like the end when Juliette Lewis drives the RV away - the camera pans back to reveal that the "Titty Twister" bar is the top of an Aztec temple, obviously the source and true home of the vampires! DO NOT bother watching From Dusk Till Dawn 2 or 3, they are both really, really terrible films!!! To conclude, From Dusk Till Dawn is gory, funny - a fantastic film!! One of my all time favourites.

    From the very first scene in this movie, I was hooked, and I could tell this was going to be a good and enjoyable film. And of course I was right. The story is pretty simple, but how it unfolds is the best part. It starts off as a crime drama. The dialogue is done in the usual Tarantino way. A lot of funny lines. The transition in the middle of the film was well done. One minute the Gecko brothers are having a good time, the next it's a complete splatter house. The Gecko brothers were fun to watch, and equally as amusing to listen to. Harvey Keitel's part was well played, same with the kids. Rodriguez regulars(Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin) are here as well. Even if they had a small part. Tom Savini is also present and he has some pretty funny moments as well. The fist half was a interesting crime drama, if it was like that the whole time I wouldn't have complained. The second have is all out mayhem and violence, loads of special effects. I highly recommend this, genre's were blended just right, and it leaves you satisfied after the credits roll. Rodriguez and Tarantino work well together.

    In spite of too much blood and violent scenes, this film would be a great entertainment on a Friday night. I found it hard to relate this movie to "Horror" as it is tagged on IMDb: vampires are merely jokes, not even close to an actual threat. One of the funniest scene for this film is to watch how ineligible can a vampire be; it reminds me of some old time antiques like "monster squad". Come on, a vampire/werewolf that walks like an old man all the time? Sure the shooting techniques are very much limited by their time, but always I cannot help compare them to "underworld" and then conclude I probably should never watch a pure vampire film before 2000 again. Well this movie is not a pure vampire film, it's much more than that. You will see Quentin plays a psycho (I didn't know he could act), how a Vietnam veteran, a sex machine, a retired priest, a escaped thief and two kids slaughter a bunch of vampires in a bar called titty-twister, how Salma Hayek perform a half-naked dance with a snake on her, and how the thief become Dr. Phil for a priest. Lots of peoples and things died or vanished in the end, and most importantly, you will laugh our loud a lot.

    After a bank heist, brothers Richie and Seth Gecko plan to head to Mexico to evade arrest. At a motel, Richie kills their hostage and their journey hits a slump, but just when things could have gotten worse, the Fuller family shows up. Seth takes them hostage and the five successfully cross the border. They arrive at a bar called "The Titty Twister", where Seth will meet his handler in the morning. When the moon strikes, the workers in the bar turn into vampires and the survivors must soon fight for their lives..... Sometimes, its a shame that the Internet exists, and also, people who like to spoil film. If this was released in the eighties, this would have a Psycho essence to it. If you haven't seen the trailers for this, or know anything about the film, stop reading and just watch the film, it will be a surprise. Other than that, its a fine movie, Tarantino proves he cannot act, but Clooney proves he is a star in the making. He carries the film and steals every single scene from everyone else, thank heavens for this or Batman And Robin would have killed his career, he really is that good in this. The script is hilarious, Rodriguez proves he was a force to be reckoned with, and whole movie is what made Grindhouse. The opening sequence grips you, and never let's you go. But it all depends on the twist. If you swallow it, its probably one of the greats from 1996, if not, you'll probably hate it. But when it was released, the director, writer, and most of the cast were the hottest, most cult things on earth,so it may be a case of you really had to be there to appreciate it. Luckily I was, and I love returning to this film every now and again, because its fun and exciting, which is the fundamental element of cinema.

    When this film came out all I remember is that it was 'the' go to film for all things cool. The plot wasn't a surprise as the trailers pretty much gave everything away but the decade was still buzzing from Tarantino fever and after the superb 'Desperado' the teaming of Robert Rodriguez and his screen writing chum doing a film about vampires was too much pull for a 17 year old me. I can say without a doubt that it is a classic. Maybe not in the sense of Casablanca or Raiders Of The Lost Ark but as a style film it really can't be touched. Tarantino's screenplay drips with wit and humour as well as the usual taboo subjects thrown into everyday conversation and Rodriguez direction compliments this. Both men have made 'looking tacky' an art form when it comes to film and this heavily works in it's favour because we want it to feel sleazy and a bit dirty. Rodriguez has made some right stinkers in his time but in this era he was what I consider to be a proper fimmaker with no CGI and not much of a budget which pushes directors to be as creative as possible. The cast is about as good as it gets. George Cloony, who audiences were used to seeing as a respectable Doctor on the hit Series ER does a complete character 180 into the superb Seth Gecko a character with all the moral fibre of a rock and the patience of a 5 year old. He tears into the script like a hungry dog which showcases whole new side to Cloony's acting and who could forget 'that' tattoo, a tiny detail which really brought the visual impact of the character to life and has since been copied many times but back then it was a striking feature. It's probably safe to say that this film was a game changer for Cloony who gained new respect for such a radical change but sadly hasn't really done much else that comes close. As a few people have mentioned this is really two films in one, the first being a superb crime drama which sees the Gecko boys escape over the border with a kidnapped family, and the second is pure schlock nonsense and I am totally fine with that. Maybe it was the teenager in me when I saw this but nothing could make me or my pals smile more than a bit of blood, guts and vampires interlaced with ridiculous humour. Some say the vampire section brings the crime thriller down but I think the thriller part raises the profile of what is already a really cool film. So many people go by formulas, right ways to do things and rules. Where art is concerned and this includes film, music etc. there can only be guidelines and it's great to see a bunch of people making a film the way they want to make it and that means throwing whatever off beat, off topic nonsense they feel like into the mix just because they simply think it would be cool. A superb and sleazy trashcan of a movie that's not afraid to play with childish notions because it knows it's a cut above most film snobs polished favourites.

Sometimes, its a shame that the Internet exists, and also, people who like to spoil film. If this was released in the eighties, this would have a Psycho essence to it. If you haven't seen the trailers for this, or know anything about the film, stop reading and just watch the film, it will be a surprise. Other than that, its a fine movie, Tarantino proves he cannot act, but Clooney proves he is a star in the making. He carries the film and steals every single scene from everyone else, thank heavens for this or Batman And Robin would have killed his career, he really is that good in this. The script is hilarious, Rodriguez proves he was a force to be reckoned with, and whole movie is what made Grindhouse. The opening sequence grips you, and never let's you go. But it all depends on the twist. If you swallow it, its probably one of the greats from 1996, if not, you'll probably hate it. But when it was released, the director, writer, and most of the cast were the hottest, most cult things on earth,so it may be a case of you really had to be there to appreciate it. Luckily I was, and I love returning to this film every now and again, because its fun and exciting, which is the fundamental element of cinema.

    When this film came out all I remember is that it was 'the' go to film for all things cool. The plot wasn't a surprise as the trailers pretty much gave everything away but the decade was still buzzing from Tarantino fever and after the superb 'Desperado' the teaming of Robert Rodriguez and his screen writing chum doing a film about vampires was too much pull for a 17 year old me. I can say without a doubt that it is a classic. Maybe not in the sense of Casablanca or Raiders Of The Lost Ark but as a style film it really can't be touched. Tarantino's screenplay drips with wit and humour as well as the usual taboo subjects thrown into everyday conversation and Rodriguez direction compliments this. Both men have made 'looking tacky' an art form when it comes to film and this heavily works in it's favour because we want it to feel sleazy and a bit dirty. Rodriguez has made some right stinkers in his time but in this era he was what I consider to be a proper fimmaker with no CGI and not much of a budget which pushes directors to be as creative as possible. The cast is about as good as it gets. George Cloony, who audiences were used to seeing as a respectable Doctor on the hit Series ER does a complete character 180 into the superb Seth Gecko a character with all the moral fibre of a rock and the patience of a 5 year old. He tears into the script like a hungry dog which showcases whole new side to Cloony's acting and who could forget 'that' tattoo, a tiny detail which really brought the visual impact of the character to life and has since been copied many times but back then it was a striking feature. It's probably safe to say that this film was a game changer for Cloony who gained new respect for such a radical change but sadly hasn't really done much else that comes close. As a few people have mentioned this is really two films in one, the first being a superb crime drama which sees the Gecko boys escape over the border with a kidnapped family, and the second is pure schlock nonsense and I am totally fine with that. Maybe it was the teenager in me when I saw this but nothing could make me or my pals smile more than a bit of blood, guts and vampires interlaced with ridiculous humour. Some say the vampire section brings the crime thriller down but I think the thriller part raises the profile of what is already a really cool film. So many people go by formulas, right ways to do things and rules. Where art is concerned and this includes film, music etc. there can only be guidelines and it's great to see a bunch of people making a film the way they want to make it and that means throwing whatever off beat, off topic nonsense they feel like into the mix just because they simply think it would be cool. A superb and sleazy trashcan of a movie that's not afraid to play with childish notions because it knows it's a cut above most film snobs polished favourites.

    Somehow I had not heard about this movie by Rodriguez and Tarantino, and I did not read anything about it before I started watching it. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Now, I am a big fan of Tarantino and a slightly lesser fan of Rodriguez but I love Sin City and Planet Terror among others. The First hour of the movie felt to me like a typical Tarantino movie, with witty and clever dialogue, a lot of violence, and in this case a hostage situation. I thought to myself... YESSS! I am totally going to enjoy this movie, and I sure did........ Then our characters arrive at a bar called the Titty Twister,(about and hour into the movie) and I did not expect the rest of the movie to take place there. But then out of no where.... VAMPIRES! And nothing but a couple of laughs and vampire slaying till the end credits roll. We never know why the vampires are there, I guess its suppose to be just... One of those things, it can happen to anyone hah! I think I might have enjoyed this movie for what it is, had I known beforehand this was i vampire movie. I just feel like they abandoned the story line of the first half when the vampires came. And I was in no way prepared. Overall, a great first half, brought down in my opinion by the shallow vampire packed second half. Well, I should have known I guess, this being a Rodriguez film. Im still giving the movie a 7/10 just because of the first half, could have gotten a higher grade had it gone in a different direction.

    I sat down to this movie with no preconceptions whatsoever, as had been recommended to me. This turned out to be very good advice, because it makes the twist in the middle a complete surprise, and therefore all the more enjoyable. (It is for this reason that I'm giving a spoiler warning, as even knowing there is a twist might rob people of that experience.) Essentially you're thrown from one movie into a completely different one, with the main characters as the only thread holding the two together. Almost the entire plot from the first 30 minutes is rendered irrelevant, which I thought was a great idea. Usually, you sort of know where a story is going. If the point is for the protagonist to travel to a volcano and throw a ring into it, you know they are going to be successful. You have some suspense of disbelief that allows you to still experience some fear when a perilous situation presents itself, but at a more "meta" level you know what Frodo isn't going to die in the first book/film. This movie takes that expectation and punches it in the face. Unfortunately, though, the concept is not carried to a satisfying end. After the monsters are let loose, there are about 10 minutes where the movie is able to ride the absurdity of this gear shift, but then finds itself stuck with a bunch of vampires to get rid of, and a plot to tie a knot in. And through the insistence to pay homage to cheap gore movies, the tension arcs that were built up in the first half of the movie are deflated without pay-off, and the relationships between the characters are essentially reset. This robs the movie of a connection between the two stories, as well as a proper resolution. Still, it's an entertaining 90 minutes and a must-see cult classic.

    It's interesting to see these young Film maverick's at work. Shot, Cut, and Directed by Robert Rodriguez and written by Quentin Tarantino. In this early effort you can see many a thing that will become trademarks. But one must say this is far from either one's best. It is like a workout, flexing the muscles and developing the chops. There are some glorious bits here and there is enough to satisfy Film Geeks and the lovers of Drive-In/Grindhouse Flicks because that is where this colorful, violent, trashy, thing comes from. Like most Rodriquez stuff you have to bring a strong stomach and be ready for some outrageous goings-on. There is a perverted gory atmosphere and some darkly funny Tarantino dialog and the make-up and SFX are quite good. This was Clooney's big screen debut and he doesn't disappoint. The rest of the Cult Movie cast, are also along for the ride and seem to be having a grand old time. It's a loud and wild event and if you go with it there may be some eclectic enjoyment but may have some scurrying for the exits.

    A gangster/vampire hybrid masterpiece!!! I saw the film when it first came out, about 16 years ago now, back at the time people didn't know it was a vampire flick until they saw it! Nowadays, most people are aware of this even if they haven't seen it, which certainly takes the surprise element away when you watch it which for me was a big part of it. I remember when Salma Hayek first turned into a vampire during the film, I thought up until that point it was your good yet typical gangster film, how wrong was I!! The film is full of funny one liners, mostly delivered by George Clooney. Other main stars are Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Danny Trejo, Salma Hayek & Cheech (who actually plays 3 different parts in the film). My only problem with the film was Ernest Liu, who plays Scott - his acting skills were......lets say "not great".... I like the end when Juliette Lewis drives the RV away - the camera pans back to reveal that the "Titty Twister" bar is the top of an Aztec temple, obviously the source and true home of the vampires! DO NOT bother watching From Dusk Till Dawn 2 or 3, they are both really, really terrible films!!! To conclude, From Dusk Till Dawn is gory, funny - a fantastic film!! One of my all time favourites.

    From the very first scene in this movie, I was hooked, and I could tell this was going to be a good and enjoyable film. And of course I was right. The story is pretty simple, but how it unfolds is the best part. It starts off as a crime drama. The dialogue is done in the usual Tarantino way. A lot of funny lines. The transition in the middle of the film was well done. One minute the Gecko brothers are having a good time, the next it's a complete splatter house. The Gecko brothers were fun to watch, and equally as amusing to listen to. Harvey Keitel's part was well played, same with the kids. Rodriguez regulars(Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin) are here as well. Even if they had a small part. Tom Savini is also present and he has some pretty funny moments as well. The fist half was a interesting crime drama, if it was like that the whole time I wouldn't have complained. The second have is all out mayhem and violence, loads of special effects. I highly recommend this, genre's were blended just right, and it leaves you satisfied after the credits roll. Rodriguez and Tarantino work well together.

    In spite of too much blood and violent scenes, this film would be a great entertainment on a Friday night. I found it hard to relate this movie to "Horror" as it is tagged on IMDb: vampires are merely jokes, not even close to an actual threat. One of the funniest scene for this film is to watch how ineligible can a vampire be; it reminds me of some old time antiques like "monster squad". Come on, a vampire/werewolf that walks like an old man all the time? Sure the shooting techniques are very much limited by their time, but always I cannot help compare them to "underworld" and then conclude I probably should never watch a pure vampire film before 2000 again. Well this movie is not a pure vampire film, it's much more than that. You will see Quentin plays a psycho (I didn't know he could act), how a Vietnam veteran, a sex machine, a retired priest, a escaped thief and two kids slaughter a bunch of vampires in a bar called titty-twister, how Salma Hayek perform a half-naked dance with a snake on her, and how the thief become Dr. Phil for a priest. Lots of peoples and things died or vanished in the end, and most importantly, you will laugh our loud a lot.

    After a bank heist, brothers Richie and Seth Gecko plan to head to Mexico to evade arrest. At a motel, Richie kills their hostage and their journey hits a slump, but just when things could have gotten worse, the Fuller family shows up. Seth takes them hostage and the five successfully cross the border. They arrive at a bar called "The Titty Twister", where Seth will meet his handler in the morning. When the moon strikes, the workers in the bar turn into vampires and the survivors must soon fight for their lives..... Sometimes, its a shame that the Internet exists, and also, people who like to spoil film. If this was released in the eighties, this would have a Psycho essence to it. If you haven't seen the trailers for this, or know anything about the film, stop reading and just watch the film, it will be a surprise. Other than that, its a fine movie, Tarantino proves he cannot act, but Clooney proves he is a star in the making. He carries the film and steals every single scene from everyone else, thank heavens for this or Batman And Robin would have killed his career, he really is that good in this. The script is hilarious, Rodriguez proves he was a force to be reckoned with, and whole movie is what made Grindhouse. The opening sequence grips you, and never let's you go. But it all depends on the twist. If you swallow it, its probably one of the greats from 1996, if not, you'll probably hate it. But when it was released, the director, writer, and most of the cast were the hottest, most cult things on earth,so it may be a case of you really had to be there to appreciate it. Luckily I was, and I love returning to this film every now and again, because its fun and exciting, which is the fundamental element of cinema.

I can say without a doubt that it is a classic. Maybe not in the sense of Casablanca or Raiders Of The Lost Ark but as a style film it really can't be touched.

Sure the shooting techniques are very much limited by their time, but always I cannot help compare them to "underworld" and then conclude I probably should never watch a pure vampire film before 2000 again. Well this movie is not a pure vampire film, it's much more than that. You will see Quentin plays a psycho (I didn't know he could act), how a Vietnam veteran, a sex machine, a retired priest, a escaped thief and two kids slaughter a bunch of vampires in a bar called titty-twister, how Salma Hayek perform a half-naked dance with a snake on her, and how the thief become Dr. Phil for a priest. Lots of peoples and things died or vanished in the end, and most importantly, you will laugh our loud a lot.

    After a bank heist, brothers Richie and Seth Gecko plan to head to Mexico to evade arrest. At a motel, Richie kills their hostage and their journey hits a slump, but just when things could have gotten worse, the Fuller family shows up. Seth takes them hostage and the five successfully cross the border. They arrive at a bar called "The Titty Twister", where Seth will meet his handler in the morning. When the moon strikes, the workers in the bar turn into vampires and the survivors must soon fight for their lives..... Sometimes, its a shame that the Internet exists, and also, people who like to spoil film. If this was released in the eighties, this would have a Psycho essence to it. If you haven't seen the trailers for this, or know anything about the film, stop reading and just watch the film, it will be a surprise. Other than that, its a fine movie, Tarantino proves he cannot act, but Clooney proves he is a star in the making. He carries the film and steals every single scene from everyone else, thank heavens for this or Batman And Robin would have killed his career, he really is that good in this. The script is hilarious, Rodriguez proves he was a force to be reckoned with, and whole movie is what made Grindhouse. The opening sequence grips you, and never let's you go. But it all depends on the twist. If you swallow it, its probably one of the greats from 1996, if not, you'll probably hate it. But when it was released, the director, writer, and most of the cast were the hottest, most cult things on earth,so it may be a case of you really had to be there to appreciate it. Luckily I was, and I love returning to this film every now and again, because its fun and exciting, which is the fundamental element of cinema.

    When this film came out all I remember is that it was 'the' go to film for all things cool. The plot wasn't a surprise as the trailers pretty much gave everything away but the decade was still buzzing from Tarantino fever and after the superb 'Desperado' the teaming of Robert Rodriguez and his screen writing chum doing a film about vampires was too much pull for a 17 year old me. I can say without a doubt that it is a classic. Maybe not in the sense of Casablanca or Raiders Of The Lost Ark but as a style film it really can't be touched. Tarantino's screenplay drips with wit and humour as well as the usual taboo subjects thrown into everyday conversation and Rodriguez direction compliments this. Both men have made 'looking tacky' an art form when it comes to film and this heavily works in it's favour because we want it to feel sleazy and a bit dirty. Rodriguez has made some right stinkers in his time but in this era he was what I consider to be a proper fimmaker with no CGI and not much of a budget which pushes directors to be as creative as possible. The cast is about as good as it gets. George Cloony, who audiences were used to seeing as a respectable Doctor on the hit Series ER does a complete character 180 into the superb Seth Gecko a character with all the moral fibre of a rock and the patience of a 5 year old. He tears into the script like a hungry dog which showcases whole new side to Cloony's acting and who could forget 'that' tattoo, a tiny detail which really brought the visual impact of the character to life and has since been copied many times but back then it was a striking feature. It's probably safe to say that this film was a game changer for Cloony who gained new respect for such a radical change but sadly hasn't really done much else that comes close. As a few people have mentioned this is really two films in one, the first being a superb crime drama which sees the Gecko boys escape over the border with a kidnapped family, and the second is pure schlock nonsense and I am totally fine with that. Maybe it was the teenager in me when I saw this but nothing could make me or my pals smile more than a bit of blood, guts and vampires interlaced with ridiculous humour. Some say the vampire section brings the crime thriller down but I think the thriller part raises the profile of what is already a really cool film. So many people go by formulas, right ways to do things and rules. Where art is concerned and this includes film, music etc. there can only be guidelines and it's great to see a bunch of people making a film the way they want to make it and that means throwing whatever off beat, off topic nonsense they feel like into the mix just because they simply think it would be cool. A superb and sleazy trashcan of a movie that's not afraid to play with childish notions because it knows it's a cut above most film snobs polished favourites.

    Somehow I had not heard about this movie by Rodriguez and Tarantino, and I did not read anything about it before I started watching it. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Now, I am a big fan of Tarantino and a slightly lesser fan of Rodriguez but I love Sin City and Planet Terror among others. The First hour of the movie felt to me like a typical Tarantino movie, with witty and clever dialogue, a lot of violence, and in this case a hostage situation. I thought to myself... YESSS! I am totally going to enjoy this movie, and I sure did........ Then our characters arrive at a bar called the Titty Twister,(about and hour into the movie) and I did not expect the rest of the movie to take place there. But then out of no where.... VAMPIRES! And nothing but a couple of laughs and vampire slaying till the end credits roll. We never know why the vampires are there, I guess its suppose to be just... One of those things, it can happen to anyone hah! I think I might have enjoyed this movie for what it is, had I known beforehand this was i vampire movie. I just feel like they abandoned the story line of the first half when the vampires came. And I was in no way prepared. Overall, a great first half, brought down in my opinion by the shallow vampire packed second half. Well, I should have known I guess, this being a Rodriguez film. Im still giving the movie a 7/10 just because of the first half, could have gotten a higher grade had it gone in a different direction.

    I sat down to this movie with no preconceptions whatsoever, as had been recommended to me. This turned out to be very good advice, because it makes the twist in the middle a complete surprise, and therefore all the more enjoyable. (It is for this reason that I'm giving a spoiler warning, as even knowing there is a twist might rob people of that experience.) Essentially you're thrown from one movie into a completely different one, with the main characters as the only thread holding the two together. Almost the entire plot from the first 30 minutes is rendered irrelevant, which I thought was a great idea. Usually, you sort of know where a story is going. If the point is for the protagonist to travel to a volcano and throw a ring into it, you know they are going to be successful. You have some suspense of disbelief that allows you to still experience some fear when a perilous situation presents itself, but at a more "meta" level you know what Frodo isn't going to die in the first book/film. This movie takes that expectation and punches it in the face. Unfortunately, though, the concept is not carried to a satisfying end. After the monsters are let loose, there are about 10 minutes where the movie is able to ride the absurdity of this gear shift, but then finds itself stuck with a bunch of vampires to get rid of, and a plot to tie a knot in. And through the insistence to pay homage to cheap gore movies, the tension arcs that were built up in the first half of the movie are deflated without pay-off, and the relationships between the characters are essentially reset. This robs the movie of a connection between the two stories, as well as a proper resolution. Still, it's an entertaining 90 minutes and a must-see cult classic.

    It's interesting to see these young Film maverick's at work. Shot, Cut, and Directed by Robert Rodriguez and written by Quentin Tarantino. In this early effort you can see many a thing that will become trademarks. But one must say this is far from either one's best. It is like a workout, flexing the muscles and developing the chops. There are some glorious bits here and there is enough to satisfy Film Geeks and the lovers of Drive-In/Grindhouse Flicks because that is where this colorful, violent, trashy, thing comes from. Like most Rodriquez stuff you have to bring a strong stomach and be ready for some outrageous goings-on. There is a perverted gory atmosphere and some darkly funny Tarantino dialog and the make-up and SFX are quite good. This was Clooney's big screen debut and he doesn't disappoint. The rest of the Cult Movie cast, are also along for the ride and seem to be having a grand old time. It's a loud and wild event and if you go with it there may be some eclectic enjoyment but may have some scurrying for the exits.

    A gangster/vampire hybrid masterpiece!!! I saw the film when it first came out, about 16 years ago now, back at the time people didn't know it was a vampire flick until they saw it! Nowadays, most people are aware of this even if they haven't seen it, which certainly takes the surprise element away when you watch it which for me was a big part of it. I remember when Salma Hayek first turned into a vampire during the film, I thought up until that point it was your good yet typical gangster film, how wrong was I!! The film is full of funny one liners, mostly delivered by George Clooney. Other main stars are Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Danny Trejo, Salma Hayek & Cheech (who actually plays 3 different parts in the film). My only problem with the film was Ernest Liu, who plays Scott - his acting skills were......lets say "not great".... I like the end when Juliette Lewis drives the RV away - the camera pans back to reveal that the "Titty Twister" bar is the top of an Aztec temple, obviously the source and true home of the vampires! DO NOT bother watching From Dusk Till Dawn 2 or 3, they are both really, really terrible films!!! To conclude, From Dusk Till Dawn is gory, funny - a fantastic film!! One of my all time favourites.

    you read my title summary of my review of this epic trash can classic. the cast was bad as i know it story was going good but out of nowhere i wasn't expecting the horror & Dracula stuff in the film.this is so embarrassing to watch as the film includes a guy talking about pussy & pussy all the time.we all know he was not talking about a cat Tarantino is a big fool who makes cheap films his pulp fiction was funny but his most films are about sex,abusive language & mindless action. this film is a great example of how sick minded people live in this world plus on top of that Hollywood makes crap like this & people praise them. i mean wow this is a shameless film.forget George colony as he sucks at acting but what was salma hayek doing there man on man she was naked dancing & eating people,the most disgusting thing she was doing. my rating for from dust till dawn is 1/10/pure awful film if you don't have any shame & morals left then this is for you.

    From the very first scene in this movie, I was hooked, and I could tell this was going to be a good and enjoyable film. And of course I was right. The story is pretty simple, but how it unfolds is the best part. It starts off as a crime drama. The dialogue is done in the usual Tarantino way. A lot of funny lines. The transition in the middle of the film was well done. One minute the Gecko brothers are having a good time, the next it's a complete splatter house. The Gecko brothers were fun to watch, and equally as amusing to listen to. Harvey Keitel's part was well played, same with the kids. Rodriguez regulars(Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin) are here as well. Even if they had a small part. Tom Savini is also present and he has some pretty funny moments as well. The fist half was a interesting crime drama, if it was like that the whole time I wouldn't have complained. The second have is all out mayhem and violence, loads of special effects. I highly recommend this, genre's were blended just right, and it leaves you satisfied after the credits roll. Rodriguez and Tarantino work well together.
