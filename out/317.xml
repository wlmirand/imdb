    I am not British nor am I Irish. And, as far as 'the troubles' go, I don't have a very strong opinion one way or another. A lot of crazy stuff went on for so long and there's so much guilt, it's hard to take a side--though I sure hate the idea of terrorism. So, I am not a person with a dog in the fight, so to speak. I just thought I'd mention this so you don't think I had a particular stake in the film. The film is the story of Gerry Conlon, though it also affected his father, the rest of his family and some friends. Back during the heyday of IRA terrorism in the 1970s, the British were obviously very frustrated and were willing to go to some extreme methods to stop it--even if it meant suspending traditional constitutional rights. This is understandable but troubling. But what goes WAY beyond troubling were the methods used by the prosecutors and police to convict a group of people for a bombing--even when it turned out that they knew that the people were probably innocent! The film is essentially a showcase for Daniel Day-Lewis to show off his acting skills. However, the film also had lovely direction and was a first-class project all around. Well worth seeing--and there's a good chance this film might make you feel a little mad.

    (English is my second language, so please excuse my language problems:) Yes, I cried when other prisoners threw lighted papers from the window; yes, Daniel-Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite were great actors; but other than that, what impressed me most was the complete change of attitudes of the public between the two trials. At first, audience in the court were yelling "hang these Irish bastards", they were throwing all their hatred to the Guildford Four, even the judge said "I wonder why you are not charged as treason". They were biased, cheated by the prosecutes who fabricated lies to cater to the public, because the loss of 5 lives needed someone to be responsible for. But after 15 years, when the truth was presented, the public went to parade, they plead the court to free the four, they wanted to right the wrong. They were becoming rational, they felt for the innocent, so they acted. But this is not what happens here in China. The government is never transparent to the public, the media is censored so that cases like the Guildford 4 (especially if it is injustice) will never be known to the general public unless you are "in the business". Because the public is banning from first-hand information, people are unaware of government's wrongdoings; even if they are aware, there is almost nothing they can do (party monopoly, corruption all lead to this). So they kept silent, pretending nothing ever happened. I once read on a book, saying "silence is the most terrifying weapon". Today I have to admit this fact; but I want to say and plea to all my fellow citizens: pretending to be deaf doesn't mean that there is no voice in the society to be heard. They are merely sunk in the indifferent public. So please pay attention to politics, to events taking place in courts. Maybe someday we also will make cardboards with slogans on then and march in streets. Efforts from individuals could gather to really make change.

    Sometimes i say to myself "this can't happen to me" for the simple reason that it sounds really unfair to be happening..But watching a movie like this changes all perception of right and wrong, fair and unfair.. Only thing that can be fair in this world is your HEART !! Though Daniel Day Lewis' character is not your typical role model from the start, you know that the Heart within isn't black (more so from a scene just before he says 'In all my godforsaken life, I've never known what it was to kill somebody until now')..The transformation of Day Lewis' character from a man who wasn't responsible enough to take care of himself to a man who vows to fight for his father's name is brilliantly heartwarming! It just pains me to see how cruel 'WE' as a species can be to not accept our mistakes, even when we know that it can make someone's life miserable than HELL!! In all the movie is good till the time you don't think of it as someone's life being played out in front of you.As soon as you realize that,it transforms into something you cant just think of as just another brilliant movie.Instead your heart goes out to the people who actually had to go through all this.. Well directed, superbly acted, brilliant,heart breaking and heart warming at the same time !! Those who found it beautiful can go for 'Conviction' as their next choice of another heartwarming 'eye treat' !

    If you ever wanted a tutorial on perfect acting, In the Name of the Father is the perfect film to turn to. This is a very powerful film that features perhaps some of the best acting of the 1990's. This is a film, although somewhat historically inaccurate, will make viewers weep at times and cheer for the characters at other times. I have rarely seen a movie so powerful and uplifting but heart-wrenching as well. Jim Sheridan's film is about the Guilford Four and how they were wrongfully implicated by the British for an IRA bombing. The supposed leader, Gerry Conlon is sent to life in prison and is joined by his father. Together, for the next fifteen years, they do what they can to prove they're innocent and gain their freedom. Daniel-Day Lewis. Just reading that name aloud gives me goosebumps. He is the greatest actor of our generation if not the best of all time. He gives another masterful performance as Gerry Conlon. He is truly the best method actor I have ever seen. Pete Postlethwaite gives the strongest performance of his career as Gerry's caring but stern father. Emma Thompson doesn't have much screen time until the end but her screen time is well worth the wait. Overall, this is one of the best films of a decade that features some of the best film-making in cinema history. I'm glad to say this film would have joined their ranks. Even the most stern grouch would be in tears at the end of the film. I feel bad that Daniel did not take home the Oscar for the film even though Tom Hanks deserves it for his performance in Philadelphia. I rate this film 10/10.

    A man's coerced confession to an IRA bombing he didn't do imprisons his father as well; a British lawyer helps fight for their freedom. From director Jim Sheridan, comes an outstanding movie based on the true story of the Guildford Four, who were falsely accused of a pub bombing and were given lengthy prison sentences. In The Name Of The Father is an excellent movie, it's greatly acted, powerfully written, masterfully directed, and a whole lot more. And I'm not saying this as somebody who loves movies, I'm saying this as somebody who is determined to see movies that are hailed as some of the greatest of all time, and In The Name Of The Father is definitely one of those. I'm not kidding at all, this movie is absolutely stupendous, it is one of the best movies of 1993, and overall, one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie is outstanding, but in some parts it's sad, and in other parts, it's got the mood of a great feel good movie. In directing this movie, Jim Sheridan has made a masterpiece. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a performance that is like no other Daniel Day-Lewis performance that I have ever seen. Rather than playing the hero (like he did in The Last Of The Mohicans) or the villain (like he did in Gangs Of New York and There Will Be Blood), he plays Gerry Conlon, a man who gets caught up in a torrent of trouble and is wrongfully sent to prison for a crime he did not commit, Day-Lewis plays him so perfectly, that we can actually feel his sorrow and despair. The late Pete Postlethwaite was just about the same in his performance as Giuseppe Conlon, and so is Emma Thompson as Gareth Peirce, Gerry Conlon's lawyer who's trying to prove his innocence. Basically, the entire cast gave great performances, with Postlethwaite, Thompson and especially, Day-Lewis all being the best. Daniel Day-Lewis is a man who can do no wrong, I have yet to see him in a bad movie. In other words, that man is a living sensation. In The Name Of The Father is required viewing, as you will see Daniel Day-Lewis in a role that is totally unlike many of his other roles, you will say that he is absolutely stunning, you will say that he has given another one of his best performances. And you will most likely say the same thing about the movie as a whole, you will say that this movie is a masterpiece, that it's one of the best movies of all time, and many other things too. I'm very glad that I have such a wide variety in movies, because I've have been able to see movies that are hailed as some of the best of all time, and when I watched them, I agree with the common consensus. And that goes with In The Name Of The Father too, I agree that this movie is a masterpiece and that it's one of the best of the 1990's. So if you've not yet seen this fabulous film, then you've got to see it, because it IS fabulous, and when you watch it, you will perfectly see what I mean. 10/10

    IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER Andy Dufresne of Shawshank Redemption escaped with perseverance. Prison Break. John Abraham of New York came out. In silence. Then went on to become a terrorist. While Gerard Conlon; well he got his case dismissed and got the Majesty by her womanly balls. In the Name of the Father is the real life story of Gerard Conlon who along with many others was taken in under the dastardly Prevention of Terrorism Act enforced by the House of Commons in 1975 British during the war against I.R.A. for the Guildford bombings. It brings to the silverscreen a shocking and terrific portrayal of the infamous case spread over a span of 15 years affecting the lives of both the supposed guilty and their near and dear ones. Daniel Day Lewis is exceptional in this film as Gerard Conlon as also Pete Postlethwaite as his father Guiseppe. Jim Sheridan has wonderfully directed the movie with the perfect music to bring his vision of the truth to life. Watch out for the scene where Like A Rolling Stone starts in the film. This legendary song marked off the beginning of the film. As if Bob Dylan's wife set this film (read stone) rolling which only became faster and more gripping by the minute. The editing is crisp. The pace is breathtaking. While the cinematography works wonders with the company of music. The scene where The Godfather's music is in the background is a masterstroke to this clever film. That music brought an immense sense of power to that scene. As if making it reek with a ready to pounce horror. So what's wrong with the movie? Emma Thompson as Gareth. Her portrayal of the lawyer was slowing the pace whenever she came on screen. Except for the final courtroom scene where she was just unreal. Masterly in her performance only then. Another major flaw was the total disappearance of Gerard's sisters in the climax. All in all, this is one of the best courtroom-cum-prison-cum-terror-cum- biographical movies out there. The same year Schindler's List had released as also Philadelphia. Tom Hanks had edged Daniel for the best actor. It must have been so difficult for the Academy to hand out the Best Actor. Besides, it didn't get a single Oscar inspite of 7 nominations. This film is one among the unknown many. Terrific. Must-watch. Rating: 9/10, ****1/2 /5, 90/100

    After "My Left Foot", 1989' inspirational biopic of one of the most famous Irish artists, that received universal acclaim and earned his first Oscar to Daniel Day-Lewis, Jim Sheridan relates four years later another page of Irish history through "In the Name of the Father", a powerful and solid drama comforting Day-Lewis' reputation as one of the most talented actors of his generation. "In the Name of the Father", chronicles the events that lead to the arrest of the infamous 'Guildford Four': four Irish people falsely accused and convicted for the bombing of the London pub of the same name. It's a nice directorial touch that the film opens with the explosion that killed five innocent persons, the very action that would imply a vengeance- ridden reaction from the British law. Innocent people would then pay for the crime, and this is the tragedy of Gerard Patrick Conlon, a feckless Irish lead stealer, who was in London at the wrong place, at the wrong moment. Yet even as a true story, the injustice and level of sadism displayed by the British Police, with the relative complicity of the Court, seem unbelievable, flirting with the most one- dimensional kind of cinematic Manichaeism. This is where the context plays a crucial role: after a series of bombing terrorizing the British population, the Parliament voted a Terrorism Act allowing the Police to arrest suspects for seven days. Although the use of torture was prohibited, any other kind of pressure became legitimate and could be used to force the suspects to sign a confession, or their own convictions' papers. We're in a sort of post September-11 like paranoia, where the British system, lacking all the necessary perspective to properly investigate the case would spot the perfect scapegoats to compensate their own ineffectiveness. Any rational mind wouldn't believe an IRA bomber or criminal mastermind would rob a prostitute and goes back to his home like Gerry did. But those were irrational, fear-induced times. The torture scenes benefits from the spectacular performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, as the tough hoodlum reveals a vulnerable side, demonstrating innocence in every single meaning of the word. The nervous breakdown is inevitable, marking the triumph of the sadist Police officer played by Corin Redgrave, followed by a tragic domino effect. Gerry's friends and family are all arrested, including his father Giuseppe, a honest, hard- working and sensible man. It was Giuseppe who encouraged Gerry to leave Belfast for London, fearing an arrest because of his illegal activities. And Giuseppe, the character who revealed the immense actor who was the late Pete Potlewhaite, is the soul of the film. He incarnates both the educational background of Gerry: an apparent failure, and a constant guiding force meant to elevate his son, to a level of dignity despite the adversity. The titular father is Giuseppe, and the gap between him and Gerry would trace the line of Gerry's evolution and understanding process, the ultimate key of his moral triumph. The roots of Day-Lewis' torments are to have given up the conflict against the system for the more convenient one: his father, the one who holds for being responsible of all his faults. By constantly patronizing him, Giuseppe forged Gerry's rebellious instinct. Gerry lost self- respect by blaming everything on his father. He never shared room with him, but this one fictionalization is perhaps the strike of genius because the best moments of the film all focus on the father-and-son relationship. Giuseppe accepts fate as it comes while Gerry fights back without thinking. Gradually, Gerry's experience will reveal the limits of his own perceptions, even when it comes to the Irish responsibilities. The jail scenes plays a powerful counterpart to the black-and-white depiction of the British justice and are also the setting of the greatest and most emotional performances from the trio Day-Lewis, Postlewhaite and Emma Thompson as the British lawyer who'd reopen the case and allow the 'Guildford Four' to be rejudged, for an immediate release, fifteen years after the first sentence. Giuseppe would never be a free man and his death from pulmonary condition would forge the spirit of his son and give a meaning to his fight for Justice. Jim Sheridan's film is a powerful human drama featuring a magnificent and emotionally gripping metamorphosis of the central character. However, the film suffers from a few flaws on the scenes' arrangements, a criticism I also had with "My Left Foot" whose clumsy editing left a few interrogation marks, notably on the relationship between Day-Lewis and his father. "In the Name of the Father" seems so eager to be a poignant father-and-son story, a character study that the trial part was treated with more rush, only leveraged by the powerful acting of Daniel Day-Lewis. A few less scenes would have allowed to focus on Thompson's investigation, and prevent the final trial from its rather abrupt or anticlimactic feeling, maybe less the trial than the way the pivotal evidence were found. However, this is rather a regret than a criticism, the film still relies on Day-Lewis tour de force and his believable transition from a young self-centered thug to a man who'd do his best to Honor the memory of his father It's fitting that one of the scenes feature "The Godfather", especially the garden moment between Vito and Michael as the very scene represented the succession between the two persons, the transmission of heritage, between Giuseppe and his son, the transmission of common values. Conlon's personal fight would be to find out the part of him he had in common with his father, and make the most of it. In the Name of His Father.

    In the Name of the Father tells a pretty horrifying tale of several people who were wrongly accused of the Guildford bombings. It's admirably written and directed, and there's enough here to allow you to really feel for the characters involved. As it is, it strongly reminds me A Cry in the Dark, another similar biographical film about an unfortunate turn of events starring Meryl Streep. Both films work as much as they do because of their central performances, in this case Daniel Day Lewis, who is truly fantastic. Ultimately, this is an effective film that is worthy of a viewing, although I don't think it's overall as effective as A Cry in the Dark, if maybe for obvious reasons of the tragedy in the latter being worse.

    Despite good acting, I didn't really care much about the main character. Lots of pain and struggle, but it wasn't touching or whatever that magical quality is that makes a person WANT to watch the pain of a drama. I gave up halfway through. wasn't worth the time and frustration. The picture quality sucked. Hook it up to your stereo, blast the volume, and then listen to the voices as a whisper. This gritty, gut-wrenching film was difficult to watch then and has remained so even with the passage of almost 20years. Sure the politics of the period featured heavily but for me the movie was about the turbulent love that existed between father and son.

    A movie not without its flaws with a biased unidimensional perspective based on the biography by Gerry Conlon one of the accused from Guildford Four. While the overall story is commercialized and worked around for dramatic effect, Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the protagonist's father was too good in some scenes. Though it is competently performed, well written and executed, the battle is already half won with just the knowledge on the premise and the ordeal the Guildford four and Maguire seven have been through in real life. Based on real life events following Gerald Conlon ( Daniel Day-Lewis) a carefree wild youth who is accused of the Guildford bombing and imprisoned after coerced confession. This leads to arrests of his aunt's family infamously known as the Maguire Seven along with his father Guiseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), a just man trying to protect his son. After his father's death due to harsh prison environment and depression, he vows to fight back on the system with the help of a convinced lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson). The initial riot sequence was exhilarating pepped by a solid background score and hysterical atmosphere. The arrests, torture, trial and sentences leaves an emotional impact on the unjust treatment and fate of all the accused and some performances here are to be commended. But Pete Postlethwaite's portrayal of Conlon's father breaks the shackles, elevates the emotional depth in the movies and justifies the title. The initial scene where Guiseppe pleads the IRA men to forgive his son, the expression on his face when Gerald returns from England, the conversations inside the prison cell and the scene just before he dies are a few examples of his masterful performance. I can understand at a biographical point of view for a very biased approach, but as a movie which deals with other characters as well should have shown some elements of thoughts leading up to the characters in the system do what they do. Daniel Day-Lewis is reliable as ever playing a real-life character that goes through a transformation from an energetic wild youth to an introspective determined son.

    A man's coerced confession to an IRA bombing he didn't do imprisons his father as well; a British lawyer helps fight for their freedom. From director Jim Sheridan, comes an outstanding movie based on the true story of the Guildford Four, who were falsely accused of a pub bombing and were given lengthy prison sentences. In The Name Of The Father is an excellent movie, it's greatly acted, powerfully written, masterfully directed, and a whole lot more. And I'm not saying this as somebody who loves movies, I'm saying this as somebody who is determined to see movies that are hailed as some of the greatest of all time, and In The Name Of The Father is definitely one of those. I'm not kidding at all, this movie is absolutely stupendous, it is one of the best movies of 1993, and overall, one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie is outstanding, but in some parts it's sad, and in other parts, it's got the mood of a great feel good movie. In directing this movie, Jim Sheridan has made a masterpiece. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a performance that is like no other Daniel Day-Lewis performance that I have ever seen. Rather than playing the hero (like he did in The Last Of The Mohicans) or the villain (like he did in Gangs Of New York and There Will Be Blood), he plays Gerry Conlon, a man who gets caught up in a torrent of trouble and is wrongfully sent to prison for a crime he did not commit, Day-Lewis plays him so perfectly, that we can actually feel his sorrow and despair. The late Pete Postlethwaite was just about the same in his performance as Giuseppe Conlon, and so is Emma Thompson as Gareth Peirce, Gerry Conlon's lawyer who's trying to prove his innocence. Basically, the entire cast gave great performances, with Postlethwaite, Thompson and especially, Day-Lewis all being the best. Daniel Day-Lewis is a man who can do no wrong, I have yet to see him in a bad movie. In other words, that man is a living sensation. In The Name Of The Father is required viewing, as you will see Daniel Day-Lewis in a role that is totally unlike many of his other roles, you will say that he is absolutely stunning, you will say that he has given another one of his best performances. And you will most likely say the same thing about the movie as a whole, you will say that this movie is a masterpiece, that it's one of the best movies of all time, and many other things too. I'm very glad that I have such a wide variety in movies, because I've have been able to see movies that are hailed as some of the best of all time, and when I watched them, I agree with the common consensus. And that goes with In The Name Of The Father too, I agree that this movie is a masterpiece and that it's one of the best of the 1990's. So if you've not yet seen this fabulous film, then you've got to see it, because it IS fabulous, and when you watch it, you will perfectly see what I mean. 10/10

    IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER Andy Dufresne of Shawshank Redemption escaped with perseverance. Prison Break. John Abraham of New York came out. In silence. Then went on to become a terrorist. While Gerard Conlon; well he got his case dismissed and got the Majesty by her womanly balls. In the Name of the Father is the real life story of Gerard Conlon who along with many others was taken in under the dastardly Prevention of Terrorism Act enforced by the House of Commons in 1975 British during the war against I.R.A. for the Guildford bombings. It brings to the silverscreen a shocking and terrific portrayal of the infamous case spread over a span of 15 years affecting the lives of both the supposed guilty and their near and dear ones. Daniel Day Lewis is exceptional in this film as Gerard Conlon as also Pete Postlethwaite as his father Guiseppe. Jim Sheridan has wonderfully directed the movie with the perfect music to bring his vision of the truth to life. Watch out for the scene where Like A Rolling Stone starts in the film. This legendary song marked off the beginning of the film. As if Bob Dylan's wife set this film (read stone) rolling which only became faster and more gripping by the minute. The editing is crisp. The pace is breathtaking. While the cinematography works wonders with the company of music. The scene where The Godfather's music is in the background is a masterstroke to this clever film. That music brought an immense sense of power to that scene. As if making it reek with a ready to pounce horror. So what's wrong with the movie? Emma Thompson as Gareth. Her portrayal of the lawyer was slowing the pace whenever she came on screen. Except for the final courtroom scene where she was just unreal. Masterly in her performance only then. Another major flaw was the total disappearance of Gerard's sisters in the climax. All in all, this is one of the best courtroom-cum-prison-cum-terror-cum- biographical movies out there. The same year Schindler's List had released as also Philadelphia. Tom Hanks had edged Daniel for the best actor. It must have been so difficult for the Academy to hand out the Best Actor. Besides, it didn't get a single Oscar inspite of 7 nominations. This film is one among the unknown many. Terrific. Must-watch. Rating: 9/10, ****1/2 /5, 90/100

    After "My Left Foot", 1989' inspirational biopic of one of the most famous Irish artists, that received universal acclaim and earned his first Oscar to Daniel Day-Lewis, Jim Sheridan relates four years later another page of Irish history through "In the Name of the Father", a powerful and solid drama comforting Day-Lewis' reputation as one of the most talented actors of his generation. "In the Name of the Father", chronicles the events that lead to the arrest of the infamous 'Guildford Four': four Irish people falsely accused and convicted for the bombing of the London pub of the same name. It's a nice directorial touch that the film opens with the explosion that killed five innocent persons, the very action that would imply a vengeance- ridden reaction from the British law. Innocent people would then pay for the crime, and this is the tragedy of Gerard Patrick Conlon, a feckless Irish lead stealer, who was in London at the wrong place, at the wrong moment. Yet even as a true story, the injustice and level of sadism displayed by the British Police, with the relative complicity of the Court, seem unbelievable, flirting with the most one- dimensional kind of cinematic Manichaeism. This is where the context plays a crucial role: after a series of bombing terrorizing the British population, the Parliament voted a Terrorism Act allowing the Police to arrest suspects for seven days. Although the use of torture was prohibited, any other kind of pressure became legitimate and could be used to force the suspects to sign a confession, or their own convictions' papers. We're in a sort of post September-11 like paranoia, where the British system, lacking all the necessary perspective to properly investigate the case would spot the perfect scapegoats to compensate their own ineffectiveness. Any rational mind wouldn't believe an IRA bomber or criminal mastermind would rob a prostitute and goes back to his home like Gerry did. But those were irrational, fear-induced times. The torture scenes benefits from the spectacular performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, as the tough hoodlum reveals a vulnerable side, demonstrating innocence in every single meaning of the word. The nervous breakdown is inevitable, marking the triumph of the sadist Police officer played by Corin Redgrave, followed by a tragic domino effect. Gerry's friends and family are all arrested, including his father Giuseppe, a honest, hard- working and sensible man. It was Giuseppe who encouraged Gerry to leave Belfast for London, fearing an arrest because of his illegal activities. And Giuseppe, the character who revealed the immense actor who was the late Pete Potlewhaite, is the soul of the film. He incarnates both the educational background of Gerry: an apparent failure, and a constant guiding force meant to elevate his son, to a level of dignity despite the adversity. The titular father is Giuseppe, and the gap between him and Gerry would trace the line of Gerry's evolution and understanding process, the ultimate key of his moral triumph. The roots of Day-Lewis' torments are to have given up the conflict against the system for the more convenient one: his father, the one who holds for being responsible of all his faults. By constantly patronizing him, Giuseppe forged Gerry's rebellious instinct. Gerry lost self- respect by blaming everything on his father. He never shared room with him, but this one fictionalization is perhaps the strike of genius because the best moments of the film all focus on the father-and-son relationship. Giuseppe accepts fate as it comes while Gerry fights back without thinking. Gradually, Gerry's experience will reveal the limits of his own perceptions, even when it comes to the Irish responsibilities. The jail scenes plays a powerful counterpart to the black-and-white depiction of the British justice and are also the setting of the greatest and most emotional performances from the trio Day-Lewis, Postlewhaite and Emma Thompson as the British lawyer who'd reopen the case and allow the 'Guildford Four' to be rejudged, for an immediate release, fifteen years after the first sentence. Giuseppe would never be a free man and his death from pulmonary condition would forge the spirit of his son and give a meaning to his fight for Justice. Jim Sheridan's film is a powerful human drama featuring a magnificent and emotionally gripping metamorphosis of the central character. However, the film suffers from a few flaws on the scenes' arrangements, a criticism I also had with "My Left Foot" whose clumsy editing left a few interrogation marks, notably on the relationship between Day-Lewis and his father. "In the Name of the Father" seems so eager to be a poignant father-and-son story, a character study that the trial part was treated with more rush, only leveraged by the powerful acting of Daniel Day-Lewis. A few less scenes would have allowed to focus on Thompson's investigation, and prevent the final trial from its rather abrupt or anticlimactic feeling, maybe less the trial than the way the pivotal evidence were found. However, this is rather a regret than a criticism, the film still relies on Day-Lewis tour de force and his believable transition from a young self-centered thug to a man who'd do his best to Honor the memory of his father It's fitting that one of the scenes feature "The Godfather", especially the garden moment between Vito and Michael as the very scene represented the succession between the two persons, the transmission of heritage, between Giuseppe and his son, the transmission of common values. Conlon's personal fight would be to find out the part of him he had in common with his father, and make the most of it. In the Name of His Father.

    In the Name of the Father tells a pretty horrifying tale of several people who were wrongly accused of the Guildford bombings. It's admirably written and directed, and there's enough here to allow you to really feel for the characters involved. As it is, it strongly reminds me A Cry in the Dark, another similar biographical film about an unfortunate turn of events starring Meryl Streep. Both films work as much as they do because of their central performances, in this case Daniel Day Lewis, who is truly fantastic. Ultimately, this is an effective film that is worthy of a viewing, although I don't think it's overall as effective as A Cry in the Dark, if maybe for obvious reasons of the tragedy in the latter being worse.

    Despite good acting, I didn't really care much about the main character. Lots of pain and struggle, but it wasn't touching or whatever that magical quality is that makes a person WANT to watch the pain of a drama. I gave up halfway through. wasn't worth the time and frustration. The picture quality sucked. Hook it up to your stereo, blast the volume, and then listen to the voices as a whisper. This gritty, gut-wrenching film was difficult to watch then and has remained so even with the passage of almost 20years. Sure the politics of the period featured heavily but for me the movie was about the turbulent love that existed between father and son.

    A movie not without its flaws with a biased unidimensional perspective based on the biography by Gerry Conlon one of the accused from Guildford Four. While the overall story is commercialized and worked around for dramatic effect, Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the protagonist's father was too good in some scenes. Though it is competently performed, well written and executed, the battle is already half won with just the knowledge on the premise and the ordeal the Guildford four and Maguire seven have been through in real life. Based on real life events following Gerald Conlon ( Daniel Day-Lewis) a carefree wild youth who is accused of the Guildford bombing and imprisoned after coerced confession. This leads to arrests of his aunt's family infamously known as the Maguire Seven along with his father Guiseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), a just man trying to protect his son. After his father's death due to harsh prison environment and depression, he vows to fight back on the system with the help of a convinced lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson). The initial riot sequence was exhilarating pepped by a solid background score and hysterical atmosphere. The arrests, torture, trial and sentences leaves an emotional impact on the unjust treatment and fate of all the accused and some performances here are to be commended. But Pete Postlethwaite's portrayal of Conlon's father breaks the shackles, elevates the emotional depth in the movies and justifies the title. The initial scene where Guiseppe pleads the IRA men to forgive his son, the expression on his face when Gerald returns from England, the conversations inside the prison cell and the scene just before he dies are a few examples of his masterful performance. I can understand at a biographical point of view for a very biased approach, but as a movie which deals with other characters as well should have shown some elements of thoughts leading up to the characters in the system do what they do. Daniel Day-Lewis is reliable as ever playing a real-life character that goes through a transformation from an energetic wild youth to an introspective determined son. Terrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite

    I am not British nor am I Irish. And, as far as 'the troubles' go, I don't have a very strong opinion one way or another. A lot of crazy stuff went on for so long and there's so much guilt, it's hard to take a side--though I sure hate the idea of terrorism. So, I am not a person with a dog in the fight, so to speak. I just thought I'd mention this so you don't think I had a particular stake in the film. The film is the story of Gerry Conlon, though it also affected his father, the rest of his family and some friends. Back during the heyday of IRA terrorism in the 1970s, the British were obviously very frustrated and were willing to go to some extreme methods to stop it--even if it meant suspending traditional constitutional rights. This is understandable but troubling. But what goes WAY beyond troubling were the methods used by the prosecutors and police to convict a group of people for a bombing--even when it turned out that they knew that the people were probably innocent! The film is essentially a showcase for Daniel Day-Lewis to show off his acting skills. However, the film also had lovely direction and was a first-class project all around. Well worth seeing--and there's a good chance this film might make you feel a little mad.

    (English is my second language, so please excuse my language problems:) Yes, I cried when other prisoners threw lighted papers from the window; yes, Daniel-Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite were great actors; but other than that, what impressed me most was the complete change of attitudes of the public between the two trials. At first, audience in the court were yelling "hang these Irish bastards", they were throwing all their hatred to the Guildford Four, even the judge said "I wonder why you are not charged as treason". They were biased, cheated by the prosecutes who fabricated lies to cater to the public, because the loss of 5 lives needed someone to be responsible for. But after 15 years, when the truth was presented, the public went to parade, they plead the court to free the four, they wanted to right the wrong. They were becoming rational, they felt for the innocent, so they acted. But this is not what happens here in China. The government is never transparent to the public, the media is censored so that cases like the Guildford 4 (especially if it is injustice) will never be known to the general public unless you are "in the business". Because the public is banning from first-hand information, people are unaware of government's wrongdoings; even if they are aware, there is almost nothing they can do (party monopoly, corruption all lead to this). So they kept silent, pretending nothing ever happened. I once read on a book, saying "silence is the most terrifying weapon". Today I have to admit this fact; but I want to say and plea to all my fellow citizens: pretending to be deaf doesn't mean that there is no voice in the society to be heard. They are merely sunk in the indifferent public. So please pay attention to politics, to events taking place in courts. Maybe someday we also will make cardboards with slogans on then and march in streets. Efforts from individuals could gather to really make change.

    Sometimes i say to myself "this can't happen to me" for the simple reason that it sounds really unfair to be happening..But watching a movie like this changes all perception of right and wrong, fair and unfair.. Only thing that can be fair in this world is your HEART !! Though Daniel Day Lewis' character is not your typical role model from the start, you know that the Heart within isn't black (more so from a scene just before he says 'In all my godforsaken life, I've never known what it was to kill somebody until now')..The transformation of Day Lewis' character from a man who wasn't responsible enough to take care of himself to a man who vows to fight for his father's name is brilliantly heartwarming! It just pains me to see how cruel 'WE' as a species can be to not accept our mistakes, even when we know that it can make someone's life miserable than HELL!! In all the movie is good till the time you don't think of it as someone's life being played out in front of you.As soon as you realize that,it transforms into something you cant just think of as just another brilliant movie.Instead your heart goes out to the people who actually had to go through all this.. Well directed, superbly acted, brilliant,heart breaking and heart warming at the same time !! Those who found it beautiful can go for 'Conviction' as their next choice of another heartwarming 'eye treat' !

    If you ever wanted a tutorial on perfect acting, In the Name of the Father is the perfect film to turn to. This is a very powerful film that features perhaps some of the best acting of the 1990's. This is a film, although somewhat historically inaccurate, will make viewers weep at times and cheer for the characters at other times. I have rarely seen a movie so powerful and uplifting but heart-wrenching as well. Jim Sheridan's film is about the Guilford Four and how they were wrongfully implicated by the British for an IRA bombing. The supposed leader, Gerry Conlon is sent to life in prison and is joined by his father. Together, for the next fifteen years, they do what they can to prove they're innocent and gain their freedom. Daniel-Day Lewis. Just reading that name aloud gives me goosebumps. He is the greatest actor of our generation if not the best of all time. He gives another masterful performance as Gerry Conlon. He is truly the best method actor I have ever seen. Pete Postlethwaite gives the strongest performance of his career as Gerry's caring but stern father. Emma Thompson doesn't have much screen time until the end but her screen time is well worth the wait. Overall, this is one of the best films of a decade that features some of the best film-making in cinema history. I'm glad to say this film would have joined their ranks. Even the most stern grouch would be in tears at the end of the film. I feel bad that Daniel did not take home the Oscar for the film even though Tom Hanks deserves it for his performance in Philadelphia. I rate this film 10/10.

The jail scenes plays a powerful counterpart to the black-and-white depiction of the British justice and are also the setting of the greatest and most emotional performances from the trio Day-Lewis, Postlewhaite and Emma Thompson as the British lawyer who'd reopen the case and allow the 'Guildford Four' to be rejudged, for an immediate release, fifteen years after the first sentence. Giuseppe would never be a free man and his death from pulmonary condition would forge the spirit of his son and give a meaning to his fight for Justice. Jim Sheridan's film is a powerful human drama featuring a magnificent and emotionally gripping metamorphosis of the central character. However, the film suffers from a few flaws on the scenes' arrangements, a criticism I also had with "My Left Foot" whose clumsy editing left a few interrogation marks, notably on the relationship between Day-Lewis and his father. "In the Name of the Father" seems so eager to be a poignant father-and-son story, a character study that the trial part was treated with more rush, only leveraged by the powerful acting of Daniel Day-Lewis. A few less scenes would have allowed to focus on Thompson's investigation, and prevent the final trial from its rather abrupt or anticlimactic feeling, maybe less the trial than the way the pivotal evidence were found. However, this is rather a regret than a criticism, the film still relies on Day-Lewis tour de force and his believable transition from a young self-centered thug to a man who'd do his best to Honor the memory of his father It's fitting that one of the scenes feature "The Godfather", especially the garden moment between Vito and Michael as the very scene represented the succession between the two persons, the transmission of heritage, between Giuseppe and his son, the transmission of common values. Conlon's personal fight would be to find out the part of him he had in common with his father, and make the most of it. In the Name of His Father.

    In the Name of the Father tells a pretty horrifying tale of several people who were wrongly accused of the Guildford bombings. It's admirably written and directed, and there's enough here to allow you to really feel for the characters involved. As it is, it strongly reminds me A Cry in the Dark, another similar biographical film about an unfortunate turn of events starring Meryl Streep. Both films work as much as they do because of their central performances, in this case Daniel Day Lewis, who is truly fantastic. Ultimately, this is an effective film that is worthy of a viewing, although I don't think it's overall as effective as A Cry in the Dark, if maybe for obvious reasons of the tragedy in the latter being worse.

    Despite good acting, I didn't really care much about the main character. Lots of pain and struggle, but it wasn't touching or whatever that magical quality is that makes a person WANT to watch the pain of a drama. I gave up halfway through. wasn't worth the time and frustration. The picture quality sucked. Hook it up to your stereo, blast the volume, and then listen to the voices as a whisper. This gritty, gut-wrenching film was difficult to watch then and has remained so even with the passage of almost 20years. Sure the politics of the period featured heavily but for me the movie was about the turbulent love that existed between father and son.

    A movie not without its flaws with a biased unidimensional perspective based on the biography by Gerry Conlon one of the accused from Guildford Four. While the overall story is commercialized and worked around for dramatic effect, Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the protagonist's father was too good in some scenes. Though it is competently performed, well written and executed, the battle is already half won with just the knowledge on the premise and the ordeal the Guildford four and Maguire seven have been through in real life. Based on real life events following Gerald Conlon ( Daniel Day-Lewis) a carefree wild youth who is accused of the Guildford bombing and imprisoned after coerced confession. This leads to arrests of his aunt's family infamously known as the Maguire Seven along with his father Guiseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), a just man trying to protect his son. After his father's death due to harsh prison environment and depression, he vows to fight back on the system with the help of a convinced lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson). The initial riot sequence was exhilarating pepped by a solid background score and hysterical atmosphere. The arrests, torture, trial and sentences leaves an emotional impact on the unjust treatment and fate of all the accused and some performances here are to be commended. But Pete Postlethwaite's portrayal of Conlon's father breaks the shackles, elevates the emotional depth in the movies and justifies the title. The initial scene where Guiseppe pleads the IRA men to forgive his son, the expression on his face when Gerald returns from England, the conversations inside the prison cell and the scene just before he dies are a few examples of his masterful performance. I can understand at a biographical point of view for a very biased approach, but as a movie which deals with other characters as well should have shown some elements of thoughts leading up to the characters in the system do what they do. Daniel Day-Lewis is reliable as ever playing a real-life character that goes through a transformation from an energetic wild youth to an introspective determined son.

    I am not British nor am I Irish. And, as far as 'the troubles' go, I don't have a very strong opinion one way or another. A lot of crazy stuff went on for so long and there's so much guilt, it's hard to take a side--though I sure hate the idea of terrorism. So, I am not a person with a dog in the fight, so to speak. I just thought I'd mention this so you don't think I had a particular stake in the film. The film is the story of Gerry Conlon, though it also affected his father, the rest of his family and some friends. Back during the heyday of IRA terrorism in the 1970s, the British were obviously very frustrated and were willing to go to some extreme methods to stop it--even if it meant suspending traditional constitutional rights. This is understandable but troubling. But what goes WAY beyond troubling were the methods used by the prosecutors and police to convict a group of people for a bombing--even when it turned out that they knew that the people were probably innocent! The film is essentially a showcase for Daniel Day-Lewis to show off his acting skills. However, the film also had lovely direction and was a first-class project all around. Well worth seeing--and there's a good chance this film might make you feel a little mad.

    (English is my second language, so please excuse my language problems:) Yes, I cried when other prisoners threw lighted papers from the window; yes, Daniel-Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite were great actors; but other than that, what impressed me most was the complete change of attitudes of the public between the two trials. At first, audience in the court were yelling "hang these Irish bastards", they were throwing all their hatred to the Guildford Four, even the judge said "I wonder why you are not charged as treason". They were biased, cheated by the prosecutes who fabricated lies to cater to the public, because the loss of 5 lives needed someone to be responsible for. But after 15 years, when the truth was presented, the public went to parade, they plead the court to free the four, they wanted to right the wrong. They were becoming rational, they felt for the innocent, so they acted. But this is not what happens here in China. The government is never transparent to the public, the media is censored so that cases like the Guildford 4 (especially if it is injustice) will never be known to the general public unless you are "in the business". Because the public is banning from first-hand information, people are unaware of government's wrongdoings; even if they are aware, there is almost nothing they can do (party monopoly, corruption all lead to this). So they kept silent, pretending nothing ever happened. I once read on a book, saying "silence is the most terrifying weapon". Today I have to admit this fact; but I want to say and plea to all my fellow citizens: pretending to be deaf doesn't mean that there is no voice in the society to be heard. They are merely sunk in the indifferent public. So please pay attention to politics, to events taking place in courts. Maybe someday we also will make cardboards with slogans on then and march in streets. Efforts from individuals could gather to really make change.

    Sometimes i say to myself "this can't happen to me" for the simple reason that it sounds really unfair to be happening..But watching a movie like this changes all perception of right and wrong, fair and unfair.. Only thing that can be fair in this world is your HEART !! Though Daniel Day Lewis' character is not your typical role model from the start, you know that the Heart within isn't black (more so from a scene just before he says 'In all my godforsaken life, I've never known what it was to kill somebody until now')..The transformation of Day Lewis' character from a man who wasn't responsible enough to take care of himself to a man who vows to fight for his father's name is brilliantly heartwarming! It just pains me to see how cruel 'WE' as a species can be to not accept our mistakes, even when we know that it can make someone's life miserable than HELL!! In all the movie is good till the time you don't think of it as someone's life being played out in front of you.As soon as you realize that,it transforms into something you cant just think of as just another brilliant movie.Instead your heart goes out to the people who actually had to go through all this.. Well directed, superbly acted, brilliant,heart breaking and heart warming at the same time !! Those who found it beautiful can go for 'Conviction' as their next choice of another heartwarming 'eye treat' !

    If you ever wanted a tutorial on perfect acting, In the Name of the Father is the perfect film to turn to. This is a very powerful film that features perhaps some of the best acting of the 1990's. This is a film, although somewhat historically inaccurate, will make viewers weep at times and cheer for the characters at other times. I have rarely seen a movie so powerful and uplifting but heart-wrenching as well. Jim Sheridan's film is about the Guilford Four and how they were wrongfully implicated by the British for an IRA bombing. The supposed leader, Gerry Conlon is sent to life in prison and is joined by his father. Together, for the next fifteen years, they do what they can to prove they're innocent and gain their freedom. Daniel-Day Lewis. Just reading that name aloud gives me goosebumps. He is the greatest actor of our generation if not the best of all time. He gives another masterful performance as Gerry Conlon. He is truly the best method actor I have ever seen. Pete Postlethwaite gives the strongest performance of his career as Gerry's caring but stern father. Emma Thompson doesn't have much screen time until the end but her screen time is well worth the wait. Overall, this is one of the best films of a decade that features some of the best film-making in cinema history. I'm glad to say this film would have joined their ranks. Even the most stern grouch would be in tears at the end of the film. I feel bad that Daniel did not take home the Oscar for the film even though Tom Hanks deserves it for his performance in Philadelphia. I rate this film 10/10.

    A man's coerced confession to an IRA bombing he didn't do imprisons his father as well; a British lawyer helps fight for their freedom. From director Jim Sheridan, comes an outstanding movie based on the true story of the Guildford Four, who were falsely accused of a pub bombing and were given lengthy prison sentences. In The Name Of The Father is an excellent movie, it's greatly acted, powerfully written, masterfully directed, and a whole lot more. And I'm not saying this as somebody who loves movies, I'm saying this as somebody who is determined to see movies that are hailed as some of the greatest of all time, and In The Name Of The Father is definitely one of those. I'm not kidding at all, this movie is absolutely stupendous, it is one of the best movies of 1993, and overall, one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie is outstanding, but in some parts it's sad, and in other parts, it's got the mood of a great feel good movie. In directing this movie, Jim Sheridan has made a masterpiece. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a performance that is like no other Daniel Day-Lewis performance that I have ever seen. Rather than playing the hero (like he did in The Last Of The Mohicans) or the villain (like he did in Gangs Of New York and There Will Be Blood), he plays Gerry Conlon, a man who gets caught up in a torrent of trouble and is wrongfully sent to prison for a crime he did not commit, Day-Lewis plays him so perfectly, that we can actually feel his sorrow and despair. The late Pete Postlethwaite was just about the same in his performance as Giuseppe Conlon, and so is Emma Thompson as Gareth Peirce, Gerry Conlon's lawyer who's trying to prove his innocence. Basically, the entire cast gave great performances, with Postlethwaite, Thompson and especially, Day-Lewis all being the best. Daniel Day-Lewis is a man who can do no wrong, I have yet to see him in a bad movie. In other words, that man is a living sensation. In The Name Of The Father is required viewing, as you will see Daniel Day-Lewis in a role that is totally unlike many of his other roles, you will say that he is absolutely stunning, you will say that he has given another one of his best performances. And you will most likely say the same thing about the movie as a whole, you will say that this movie is a masterpiece, that it's one of the best movies of all time, and many other things too. I'm very glad that I have such a wide variety in movies, because I've have been able to see movies that are hailed as some of the best of all time, and when I watched them, I agree with the common consensus. And that goes with In The Name Of The Father too, I agree that this movie is a masterpiece and that it's one of the best of the 1990's. So if you've not yet seen this fabulous film, then you've got to see it, because it IS fabulous, and when you watch it, you will perfectly see what I mean. 10/10

    IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER Andy Dufresne of Shawshank Redemption escaped with perseverance. Prison Break. John Abraham of New York came out. In silence. Then went on to become a terrorist. While Gerard Conlon; well he got his case dismissed and got the Majesty by her womanly balls. In the Name of the Father is the real life story of Gerard Conlon who along with many others was taken in under the dastardly Prevention of Terrorism Act enforced by the House of Commons in 1975 British during the war against I.R.A. for the Guildford bombings. It brings to the silverscreen a shocking and terrific portrayal of the infamous case spread over a span of 15 years affecting the lives of both the supposed guilty and their near and dear ones. Daniel Day Lewis is exceptional in this film as Gerard Conlon as also Pete Postlethwaite as his father Guiseppe. Jim Sheridan has wonderfully directed the movie with the perfect music to bring his vision of the truth to life. Watch out for the scene where Like A Rolling Stone starts in the film. This legendary song marked off the beginning of the film. As if Bob Dylan's wife set this film (read stone) rolling which only became faster and more gripping by the minute. The editing is crisp. The pace is breathtaking. While the cinematography works wonders with the company of music. The scene where The Godfather's music is in the background is a masterstroke to this clever film. That music brought an immense sense of power to that scene. As if making it reek with a ready to pounce horror. So what's wrong with the movie? Emma Thompson as Gareth. Her portrayal of the lawyer was slowing the pace whenever she came on screen. Except for the final courtroom scene where she was just unreal. Masterly in her performance only then. Another major flaw was the total disappearance of Gerard's sisters in the climax. All in all, this is one of the best courtroom-cum-prison-cum-terror-cum- biographical movies out there. The same year Schindler's List had released as also Philadelphia. Tom Hanks had edged Daniel for the best actor. It must have been so difficult for the Academy to hand out the Best Actor. Besides, it didn't get a single Oscar inspite of 7 nominations. This film is one among the unknown many. Terrific. Must-watch. Rating: 9/10, ****1/2 /5, 90/100

    After "My Left Foot", 1989' inspirational biopic of one of the most famous Irish artists, that received universal acclaim and earned his first Oscar to Daniel Day-Lewis, Jim Sheridan relates four years later another page of Irish history through "In the Name of the Father", a powerful and solid drama comforting Day-Lewis' reputation as one of the most talented actors of his generation. "In the Name of the Father", chronicles the events that lead to the arrest of the infamous 'Guildford Four': four Irish people falsely accused and convicted for the bombing of the London pub of the same name. It's a nice directorial touch that the film opens with the explosion that killed five innocent persons, the very action that would imply a vengeance- ridden reaction from the British law. Innocent people would then pay for the crime, and this is the tragedy of Gerard Patrick Conlon, a feckless Irish lead stealer, who was in London at the wrong place, at the wrong moment. Yet even as a true story, the injustice and level of sadism displayed by the British Police, with the relative complicity of the Court, seem unbelievable, flirting with the most one- dimensional kind of cinematic Manichaeism. This is where the context plays a crucial role: after a series of bombing terrorizing the British population, the Parliament voted a Terrorism Act allowing the Police to arrest suspects for seven days. Although the use of torture was prohibited, any other kind of pressure became legitimate and could be used to force the suspects to sign a confession, or their own convictions' papers. We're in a sort of post September-11 like paranoia, where the British system, lacking all the necessary perspective to properly investigate the case would spot the perfect scapegoats to compensate their own ineffectiveness. Any rational mind wouldn't believe an IRA bomber or criminal mastermind would rob a prostitute and goes back to his home like Gerry did. But those were irrational, fear-induced times. The torture scenes benefits from the spectacular performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, as the tough hoodlum reveals a vulnerable side, demonstrating innocence in every single meaning of the word. The nervous breakdown is inevitable, marking the triumph of the sadist Police officer played by Corin Redgrave, followed by a tragic domino effect. Gerry's friends and family are all arrested, including his father Giuseppe, a honest, hard- working and sensible man. It was Giuseppe who encouraged Gerry to leave Belfast for London, fearing an arrest because of his illegal activities. And Giuseppe, the character who revealed the immense actor who was the late Pete Potlewhaite, is the soul of the film. He incarnates both the educational background of Gerry: an apparent failure, and a constant guiding force meant to elevate his son, to a level of dignity despite the adversity. The titular father is Giuseppe, and the gap between him and Gerry would trace the line of Gerry's evolution and understanding process, the ultimate key of his moral triumph. The roots of Day-Lewis' torments are to have given up the conflict against the system for the more convenient one: his father, the one who holds for being responsible of all his faults. By constantly patronizing him, Giuseppe forged Gerry's rebellious instinct. Gerry lost self- respect by blaming everything on his father. He never shared room with him, but this one fictionalization is perhaps the strike of genius because the best moments of the film all focus on the father-and-son relationship. Giuseppe accepts fate as it comes while Gerry fights back without thinking. Gradually, Gerry's experience will reveal the limits of his own perceptions, even when it comes to the Irish responsibilities. The jail scenes plays a powerful counterpart to the black-and-white depiction of the British justice and are also the setting of the greatest and most emotional performances from the trio Day-Lewis, Postlewhaite and Emma Thompson as the British lawyer who'd reopen the case and allow the 'Guildford Four' to be rejudged, for an immediate release, fifteen years after the first sentence. Giuseppe would never be a free man and his death from pulmonary condition would forge the spirit of his son and give a meaning to his fight for Justice. Jim Sheridan's film is a powerful human drama featuring a magnificent and emotionally gripping metamorphosis of the central character. However, the film suffers from a few flaws on the scenes' arrangements, a criticism I also had with "My Left Foot" whose clumsy editing left a few interrogation marks, notably on the relationship between Day-Lewis and his father.

Today I have to admit this fact; but I want to say and plea to all my fellow citizens: pretending to be deaf doesn't mean that there is no voice in the society to be heard. They are merely sunk in the indifferent public. So please pay attention to politics, to events taking place in courts. Maybe someday we also will make cardboards with slogans on then and march in streets. Efforts from individuals could gather to really make change.

    Sometimes i say to myself "this can't happen to me" for the simple reason that it sounds really unfair to be happening..But watching a movie like this changes all perception of right and wrong, fair and unfair.. Only thing that can be fair in this world is your HEART !! Though Daniel Day Lewis' character is not your typical role model from the start, you know that the Heart within isn't black (more so from a scene just before he says 'In all my godforsaken life, I've never known what it was to kill somebody until now')..The transformation of Day Lewis' character from a man who wasn't responsible enough to take care of himself to a man who vows to fight for his father's name is brilliantly heartwarming! It just pains me to see how cruel 'WE' as a species can be to not accept our mistakes, even when we know that it can make someone's life miserable than HELL!! In all the movie is good till the time you don't think of it as someone's life being played out in front of you.As soon as you realize that,it transforms into something you cant just think of as just another brilliant movie.Instead your heart goes out to the people who actually had to go through all this.. Well directed, superbly acted, brilliant,heart breaking and heart warming at the same time !! Those who found it beautiful can go for 'Conviction' as their next choice of another heartwarming 'eye treat' !

    If you ever wanted a tutorial on perfect acting, In the Name of the Father is the perfect film to turn to. This is a very powerful film that features perhaps some of the best acting of the 1990's. This is a film, although somewhat historically inaccurate, will make viewers weep at times and cheer for the characters at other times. I have rarely seen a movie so powerful and uplifting but heart-wrenching as well. Jim Sheridan's film is about the Guilford Four and how they were wrongfully implicated by the British for an IRA bombing. The supposed leader, Gerry Conlon is sent to life in prison and is joined by his father. Together, for the next fifteen years, they do what they can to prove they're innocent and gain their freedom. Daniel-Day Lewis. Just reading that name aloud gives me goosebumps. He is the greatest actor of our generation if not the best of all time. He gives another masterful performance as Gerry Conlon. He is truly the best method actor I have ever seen. Pete Postlethwaite gives the strongest performance of his career as Gerry's caring but stern father. Emma Thompson doesn't have much screen time until the end but her screen time is well worth the wait. Overall, this is one of the best films of a decade that features some of the best film-making in cinema history. I'm glad to say this film would have joined their ranks. Even the most stern grouch would be in tears at the end of the film. I feel bad that Daniel did not take home the Oscar for the film even though Tom Hanks deserves it for his performance in Philadelphia. I rate this film 10/10.

    A man's coerced confession to an IRA bombing he didn't do imprisons his father as well; a British lawyer helps fight for their freedom. From director Jim Sheridan, comes an outstanding movie based on the true story of the Guildford Four, who were falsely accused of a pub bombing and were given lengthy prison sentences. In The Name Of The Father is an excellent movie, it's greatly acted, powerfully written, masterfully directed, and a whole lot more. And I'm not saying this as somebody who loves movies, I'm saying this as somebody who is determined to see movies that are hailed as some of the greatest of all time, and In The Name Of The Father is definitely one of those. I'm not kidding at all, this movie is absolutely stupendous, it is one of the best movies of 1993, and overall, one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie is outstanding, but in some parts it's sad, and in other parts, it's got the mood of a great feel good movie. In directing this movie, Jim Sheridan has made a masterpiece. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a performance that is like no other Daniel Day-Lewis performance that I have ever seen. Rather than playing the hero (like he did in The Last Of The Mohicans) or the villain (like he did in Gangs Of New York and There Will Be Blood), he plays Gerry Conlon, a man who gets caught up in a torrent of trouble and is wrongfully sent to prison for a crime he did not commit, Day-Lewis plays him so perfectly, that we can actually feel his sorrow and despair. The late Pete Postlethwaite was just about the same in his performance as Giuseppe Conlon, and so is Emma Thompson as Gareth Peirce, Gerry Conlon's lawyer who's trying to prove his innocence. Basically, the entire cast gave great performances, with Postlethwaite, Thompson and especially, Day-Lewis all being the best. Daniel Day-Lewis is a man who can do no wrong, I have yet to see him in a bad movie. In other words, that man is a living sensation. In The Name Of The Father is required viewing, as you will see Daniel Day-Lewis in a role that is totally unlike many of his other roles, you will say that he is absolutely stunning, you will say that he has given another one of his best performances. And you will most likely say the same thing about the movie as a whole, you will say that this movie is a masterpiece, that it's one of the best movies of all time, and many other things too. I'm very glad that I have such a wide variety in movies, because I've have been able to see movies that are hailed as some of the best of all time, and when I watched them, I agree with the common consensus. And that goes with In The Name Of The Father too, I agree that this movie is a masterpiece and that it's one of the best of the 1990's. So if you've not yet seen this fabulous film, then you've got to see it, because it IS fabulous, and when you watch it, you will perfectly see what I mean. 10/10

    IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER Andy Dufresne of Shawshank Redemption escaped with perseverance. Prison Break. John Abraham of New York came out. In silence. Then went on to become a terrorist. While Gerard Conlon; well he got his case dismissed and got the Majesty by her womanly balls. In the Name of the Father is the real life story of Gerard Conlon who along with many others was taken in under the dastardly Prevention of Terrorism Act enforced by the House of Commons in 1975 British during the war against I.R.A. for the Guildford bombings. It brings to the silverscreen a shocking and terrific portrayal of the infamous case spread over a span of 15 years affecting the lives of both the supposed guilty and their near and dear ones. Daniel Day Lewis is exceptional in this film as Gerard Conlon as also Pete Postlethwaite as his father Guiseppe. Jim Sheridan has wonderfully directed the movie with the perfect music to bring his vision of the truth to life. Watch out for the scene where Like A Rolling Stone starts in the film. This legendary song marked off the beginning of the film. As if Bob Dylan's wife set this film (read stone) rolling which only became faster and more gripping by the minute. The editing is crisp. The pace is breathtaking. While the cinematography works wonders with the company of music. The scene where The Godfather's music is in the background is a masterstroke to this clever film. That music brought an immense sense of power to that scene. As if making it reek with a ready to pounce horror. So what's wrong with the movie? Emma Thompson as Gareth. Her portrayal of the lawyer was slowing the pace whenever she came on screen. Except for the final courtroom scene where she was just unreal. Masterly in her performance only then. Another major flaw was the total disappearance of Gerard's sisters in the climax. All in all, this is one of the best courtroom-cum-prison-cum-terror-cum- biographical movies out there. The same year Schindler's List had released as also Philadelphia. Tom Hanks had edged Daniel for the best actor. It must have been so difficult for the Academy to hand out the Best Actor. Besides, it didn't get a single Oscar inspite of 7 nominations. This film is one among the unknown many. Terrific. Must-watch. Rating: 9/10, ****1/2 /5, 90/100

    After "My Left Foot", 1989' inspirational biopic of one of the most famous Irish artists, that received universal acclaim and earned his first Oscar to Daniel Day-Lewis, Jim Sheridan relates four years later another page of Irish history through "In the Name of the Father", a powerful and solid drama comforting Day-Lewis' reputation as one of the most talented actors of his generation. "In the Name of the Father", chronicles the events that lead to the arrest of the infamous 'Guildford Four': four Irish people falsely accused and convicted for the bombing of the London pub of the same name. It's a nice directorial touch that the film opens with the explosion that killed five innocent persons, the very action that would imply a vengeance- ridden reaction from the British law. Innocent people would then pay for the crime, and this is the tragedy of Gerard Patrick Conlon, a feckless Irish lead stealer, who was in London at the wrong place, at the wrong moment. Yet even as a true story, the injustice and level of sadism displayed by the British Police, with the relative complicity of the Court, seem unbelievable, flirting with the most one- dimensional kind of cinematic Manichaeism. This is where the context plays a crucial role: after a series of bombing terrorizing the British population, the Parliament voted a Terrorism Act allowing the Police to arrest suspects for seven days. Although the use of torture was prohibited, any other kind of pressure became legitimate and could be used to force the suspects to sign a confession, or their own convictions' papers. We're in a sort of post September-11 like paranoia, where the British system, lacking all the necessary perspective to properly investigate the case would spot the perfect scapegoats to compensate their own ineffectiveness. Any rational mind wouldn't believe an IRA bomber or criminal mastermind would rob a prostitute and goes back to his home like Gerry did. But those were irrational, fear-induced times. The torture scenes benefits from the spectacular performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, as the tough hoodlum reveals a vulnerable side, demonstrating innocence in every single meaning of the word. The nervous breakdown is inevitable, marking the triumph of the sadist Police officer played by Corin Redgrave, followed by a tragic domino effect. Gerry's friends and family are all arrested, including his father Giuseppe, a honest, hard- working and sensible man. It was Giuseppe who encouraged Gerry to leave Belfast for London, fearing an arrest because of his illegal activities. And Giuseppe, the character who revealed the immense actor who was the late Pete Potlewhaite, is the soul of the film. He incarnates both the educational background of Gerry: an apparent failure, and a constant guiding force meant to elevate his son, to a level of dignity despite the adversity. The titular father is Giuseppe, and the gap between him and Gerry would trace the line of Gerry's evolution and understanding process, the ultimate key of his moral triumph. The roots of Day-Lewis' torments are to have given up the conflict against the system for the more convenient one: his father, the one who holds for being responsible of all his faults. By constantly patronizing him, Giuseppe forged Gerry's rebellious instinct. Gerry lost self- respect by blaming everything on his father. He never shared room with him, but this one fictionalization is perhaps the strike of genius because the best moments of the film all focus on the father-and-son relationship. Giuseppe accepts fate as it comes while Gerry fights back without thinking. Gradually, Gerry's experience will reveal the limits of his own perceptions, even when it comes to the Irish responsibilities. The jail scenes plays a powerful counterpart to the black-and-white depiction of the British justice and are also the setting of the greatest and most emotional performances from the trio Day-Lewis, Postlewhaite and Emma Thompson as the British lawyer who'd reopen the case and allow the 'Guildford Four' to be rejudged, for an immediate release, fifteen years after the first sentence. Giuseppe would never be a free man and his death from pulmonary condition would forge the spirit of his son and give a meaning to his fight for Justice. Jim Sheridan's film is a powerful human drama featuring a magnificent and emotionally gripping metamorphosis of the central character. However, the film suffers from a few flaws on the scenes' arrangements, a criticism I also had with "My Left Foot" whose clumsy editing left a few interrogation marks, notably on the relationship between Day-Lewis and his father. "In the Name of the Father" seems so eager to be a poignant father-and-son story, a character study that the trial part was treated with more rush, only leveraged by the powerful acting of Daniel Day-Lewis. A few less scenes would have allowed to focus on Thompson's investigation, and prevent the final trial from its rather abrupt or anticlimactic feeling, maybe less the trial than the way the pivotal evidence were found. However, this is rather a regret than a criticism, the film still relies on Day-Lewis tour de force and his believable transition from a young self-centered thug to a man who'd do his best to Honor the memory of his father It's fitting that one of the scenes feature "The Godfather", especially the garden moment between Vito and Michael as the very scene represented the succession between the two persons, the transmission of heritage, between Giuseppe and his son, the transmission of common values. Conlon's personal fight would be to find out the part of him he had in common with his father, and make the most of it. In the Name of His Father.

    In the Name of the Father tells a pretty horrifying tale of several people who were wrongly accused of the Guildford bombings. It's admirably written and directed, and there's enough here to allow you to really feel for the characters involved. As it is, it strongly reminds me A Cry in the Dark, another similar biographical film about an unfortunate turn of events starring Meryl Streep. Both films work as much as they do because of their central performances, in this case Daniel Day Lewis, who is truly fantastic. Ultimately, this is an effective film that is worthy of a viewing, although I don't think it's overall as effective as A Cry in the Dark, if maybe for obvious reasons of the tragedy in the latter being worse.

    Despite good acting, I didn't really care much about the main character. Lots of pain and struggle, but it wasn't touching or whatever that magical quality is that makes a person WANT to watch the pain of a drama. I gave up halfway through. wasn't worth the time and frustration. The picture quality sucked. Hook it up to your stereo, blast the volume, and then listen to the voices as a whisper. This gritty, gut-wrenching film was difficult to watch then and has remained so even with the passage of almost 20years. Sure the politics of the period featured heavily but for me the movie was about the turbulent love that existed between father and son.

    A movie not without its flaws with a biased unidimensional perspective based on the biography by Gerry Conlon one of the accused from Guildford Four. While the overall story is commercialized and worked around for dramatic effect, Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the protagonist's father was too good in some scenes. Though it is competently performed, well written and executed, the battle is already half won with just the knowledge on the premise and the ordeal the Guildford four and Maguire seven have been through in real life. Based on real life events following Gerald Conlon ( Daniel Day-Lewis) a carefree wild youth who is accused of the Guildford bombing and imprisoned after coerced confession. This leads to arrests of his aunt's family infamously known as the Maguire Seven along with his father Guiseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), a just man trying to protect his son. After his father's death due to harsh prison environment and depression, he vows to fight back on the system with the help of a convinced lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson). The initial riot sequence was exhilarating pepped by a solid background score and hysterical atmosphere. The arrests, torture, trial and sentences leaves an emotional impact on the unjust treatment and fate of all the accused and some performances here are to be commended. But Pete Postlethwaite's portrayal of Conlon's father breaks the shackles, elevates the emotional depth in the movies and justifies the title. The initial scene where Guiseppe pleads the IRA men to forgive his son, the expression on his face when Gerald returns from England, the conversations inside the prison cell and the scene just before he dies are a few examples of his masterful performance. I can understand at a biographical point of view for a very biased approach, but as a movie which deals with other characters as well should have shown some elements of thoughts leading up to the characters in the system do what they do. Daniel Day-Lewis is reliable as ever playing a real-life character that goes through a transformation from an energetic wild youth to an introspective determined son. Terrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite

    I am not British nor am I Irish. And, as far as 'the troubles' go, I don't have a very strong opinion one way or another. A lot of crazy stuff went on for so long and there's so much guilt, it's hard to take a side--though I sure hate the idea of terrorism. So, I am not a person with a dog in the fight, so to speak. I just thought I'd mention this so you don't think I had a particular stake in the film. The film is the story of Gerry Conlon, though it also affected his father, the rest of his family and some friends. Back during the heyday of IRA terrorism in the 1970s, the British were obviously very frustrated and were willing to go to some extreme methods to stop it--even if it meant suspending traditional constitutional rights. This is understandable but troubling. But what goes WAY beyond troubling were the methods used by the prosecutors and police to convict a group of people for a bombing--even when it turned out that they knew that the people were probably innocent! The film is essentially a showcase for Daniel Day-Lewis to show off his acting skills. However, the film also had lovely direction and was a first-class project all around. Well worth seeing--and there's a good chance this film might make you feel a little mad.

    (English is my second language, so please excuse my language problems:) Yes, I cried when other prisoners threw lighted papers from the window; yes, Daniel-Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite were great actors; but other than that, what impressed me most was the complete change of attitudes of the public between the two trials. At first, audience in the court were yelling "hang these Irish bastards", they were throwing all their hatred to the Guildford Four, even the judge said "I wonder why you are not charged as treason". They were biased, cheated by the prosecutes who fabricated lies to cater to the public, because the loss of 5 lives needed someone to be responsible for. But after 15 years, when the truth was presented, the public went to parade, they plead the court to free the four, they wanted to right the wrong. They were becoming rational, they felt for the innocent, so they acted. But this is not what happens here in China. The government is never transparent to the public, the media is censored so that cases like the Guildford 4 (especially if it is injustice) will never be known to the general public unless you are "in the business". Because the public is banning from first-hand information, people are unaware of government's wrongdoings; even if they are aware, there is almost nothing they can do (party monopoly, corruption all lead to this). So they kept silent, pretending nothing ever happened. I once read on a book, saying "silence is the most terrifying weapon". Today I have to admit this fact; but I want to say and plea to all my fellow citizens: pretending to be deaf doesn't mean that there is no voice in the society to be heard. They are merely sunk in the indifferent public. So please pay attention to politics, to events taking place in courts. Maybe someday we also will make cardboards with slogans on then and march in streets. Efforts from individuals could gather to really make change.

Another major flaw was the total disappearance of Gerard's sisters in the climax. All in all, this is one of the best courtroom-cum-prison-cum-terror-cum- biographical movies out there. The same year Schindler's List had released as also Philadelphia. Tom Hanks had edged Daniel for the best actor. It must have been so difficult for the Academy to hand out the Best Actor. Besides, it didn't get a single Oscar inspite of 7 nominations. This film is one among the unknown many. Terrific. Must-watch. Rating: 9/10, ****1/2 /5, 90/100

    After "My Left Foot", 1989' inspirational biopic of one of the most famous Irish artists, that received universal acclaim and earned his first Oscar to Daniel Day-Lewis, Jim Sheridan relates four years later another page of Irish history through "In the Name of the Father", a powerful and solid drama comforting Day-Lewis' reputation as one of the most talented actors of his generation. "In the Name of the Father", chronicles the events that lead to the arrest of the infamous 'Guildford Four': four Irish people falsely accused and convicted for the bombing of the London pub of the same name. It's a nice directorial touch that the film opens with the explosion that killed five innocent persons, the very action that would imply a vengeance- ridden reaction from the British law. Innocent people would then pay for the crime, and this is the tragedy of Gerard Patrick Conlon, a feckless Irish lead stealer, who was in London at the wrong place, at the wrong moment. Yet even as a true story, the injustice and level of sadism displayed by the British Police, with the relative complicity of the Court, seem unbelievable, flirting with the most one- dimensional kind of cinematic Manichaeism. This is where the context plays a crucial role: after a series of bombing terrorizing the British population, the Parliament voted a Terrorism Act allowing the Police to arrest suspects for seven days. Although the use of torture was prohibited, any other kind of pressure became legitimate and could be used to force the suspects to sign a confession, or their own convictions' papers. We're in a sort of post September-11 like paranoia, where the British system, lacking all the necessary perspective to properly investigate the case would spot the perfect scapegoats to compensate their own ineffectiveness. Any rational mind wouldn't believe an IRA bomber or criminal mastermind would rob a prostitute and goes back to his home like Gerry did. But those were irrational, fear-induced times. The torture scenes benefits from the spectacular performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, as the tough hoodlum reveals a vulnerable side, demonstrating innocence in every single meaning of the word. The nervous breakdown is inevitable, marking the triumph of the sadist Police officer played by Corin Redgrave, followed by a tragic domino effect. Gerry's friends and family are all arrested, including his father Giuseppe, a honest, hard- working and sensible man. It was Giuseppe who encouraged Gerry to leave Belfast for London, fearing an arrest because of his illegal activities. And Giuseppe, the character who revealed the immense actor who was the late Pete Potlewhaite, is the soul of the film. He incarnates both the educational background of Gerry: an apparent failure, and a constant guiding force meant to elevate his son, to a level of dignity despite the adversity. The titular father is Giuseppe, and the gap between him and Gerry would trace the line of Gerry's evolution and understanding process, the ultimate key of his moral triumph. The roots of Day-Lewis' torments are to have given up the conflict against the system for the more convenient one: his father, the one who holds for being responsible of all his faults. By constantly patronizing him, Giuseppe forged Gerry's rebellious instinct. Gerry lost self- respect by blaming everything on his father. He never shared room with him, but this one fictionalization is perhaps the strike of genius because the best moments of the film all focus on the father-and-son relationship. Giuseppe accepts fate as it comes while Gerry fights back without thinking. Gradually, Gerry's experience will reveal the limits of his own perceptions, even when it comes to the Irish responsibilities. The jail scenes plays a powerful counterpart to the black-and-white depiction of the British justice and are also the setting of the greatest and most emotional performances from the trio Day-Lewis, Postlewhaite and Emma Thompson as the British lawyer who'd reopen the case and allow the 'Guildford Four' to be rejudged, for an immediate release, fifteen years after the first sentence. Giuseppe would never be a free man and his death from pulmonary condition would forge the spirit of his son and give a meaning to his fight for Justice. Jim Sheridan's film is a powerful human drama featuring a magnificent and emotionally gripping metamorphosis of the central character. However, the film suffers from a few flaws on the scenes' arrangements, a criticism I also had with "My Left Foot" whose clumsy editing left a few interrogation marks, notably on the relationship between Day-Lewis and his father. "In the Name of the Father" seems so eager to be a poignant father-and-son story, a character study that the trial part was treated with more rush, only leveraged by the powerful acting of Daniel Day-Lewis. A few less scenes would have allowed to focus on Thompson's investigation, and prevent the final trial from its rather abrupt or anticlimactic feeling, maybe less the trial than the way the pivotal evidence were found. However, this is rather a regret than a criticism, the film still relies on Day-Lewis tour de force and his believable transition from a young self-centered thug to a man who'd do his best to Honor the memory of his father It's fitting that one of the scenes feature "The Godfather", especially the garden moment between Vito and Michael as the very scene represented the succession between the two persons, the transmission of heritage, between Giuseppe and his son, the transmission of common values. Conlon's personal fight would be to find out the part of him he had in common with his father, and make the most of it. In the Name of His Father.

    In the Name of the Father tells a pretty horrifying tale of several people who were wrongly accused of the Guildford bombings. It's admirably written and directed, and there's enough here to allow you to really feel for the characters involved. As it is, it strongly reminds me A Cry in the Dark, another similar biographical film about an unfortunate turn of events starring Meryl Streep. Both films work as much as they do because of their central performances, in this case Daniel Day Lewis, who is truly fantastic. Ultimately, this is an effective film that is worthy of a viewing, although I don't think it's overall as effective as A Cry in the Dark, if maybe for obvious reasons of the tragedy in the latter being worse.

    Despite good acting, I didn't really care much about the main character. Lots of pain and struggle, but it wasn't touching or whatever that magical quality is that makes a person WANT to watch the pain of a drama. I gave up halfway through. wasn't worth the time and frustration. The picture quality sucked. Hook it up to your stereo, blast the volume, and then listen to the voices as a whisper. This gritty, gut-wrenching film was difficult to watch then and has remained so even with the passage of almost 20years. Sure the politics of the period featured heavily but for me the movie was about the turbulent love that existed between father and son.

    A movie not without its flaws with a biased unidimensional perspective based on the biography by Gerry Conlon one of the accused from Guildford Four. While the overall story is commercialized and worked around for dramatic effect, Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the protagonist's father was too good in some scenes. Though it is competently performed, well written and executed, the battle is already half won with just the knowledge on the premise and the ordeal the Guildford four and Maguire seven have been through in real life. Based on real life events following Gerald Conlon ( Daniel Day-Lewis) a carefree wild youth who is accused of the Guildford bombing and imprisoned after coerced confession. This leads to arrests of his aunt's family infamously known as the Maguire Seven along with his father Guiseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), a just man trying to protect his son. After his father's death due to harsh prison environment and depression, he vows to fight back on the system with the help of a convinced lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson). The initial riot sequence was exhilarating pepped by a solid background score and hysterical atmosphere. The arrests, torture, trial and sentences leaves an emotional impact on the unjust treatment and fate of all the accused and some performances here are to be commended. But Pete Postlethwaite's portrayal of Conlon's father breaks the shackles, elevates the emotional depth in the movies and justifies the title. The initial scene where Guiseppe pleads the IRA men to forgive his son, the expression on his face when Gerald returns from England, the conversations inside the prison cell and the scene just before he dies are a few examples of his masterful performance. I can understand at a biographical point of view for a very biased approach, but as a movie which deals with other characters as well should have shown some elements of thoughts leading up to the characters in the system do what they do. Daniel Day-Lewis is reliable as ever playing a real-life character that goes through a transformation from an energetic wild youth to an introspective determined son. Terrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite

    I am not British nor am I Irish. And, as far as 'the troubles' go, I don't have a very strong opinion one way or another. A lot of crazy stuff went on for so long and there's so much guilt, it's hard to take a side--though I sure hate the idea of terrorism. So, I am not a person with a dog in the fight, so to speak. I just thought I'd mention this so you don't think I had a particular stake in the film. The film is the story of Gerry Conlon, though it also affected his father, the rest of his family and some friends. Back during the heyday of IRA terrorism in the 1970s, the British were obviously very frustrated and were willing to go to some extreme methods to stop it--even if it meant suspending traditional constitutional rights. This is understandable but troubling. But what goes WAY beyond troubling were the methods used by the prosecutors and police to convict a group of people for a bombing--even when it turned out that they knew that the people were probably innocent! The film is essentially a showcase for Daniel Day-Lewis to show off his acting skills. However, the film also had lovely direction and was a first-class project all around. Well worth seeing--and there's a good chance this film might make you feel a little mad.

    (English is my second language, so please excuse my language problems:) Yes, I cried when other prisoners threw lighted papers from the window; yes, Daniel-Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite were great actors; but other than that, what impressed me most was the complete change of attitudes of the public between the two trials. At first, audience in the court were yelling "hang these Irish bastards", they were throwing all their hatred to the Guildford Four, even the judge said "I wonder why you are not charged as treason". They were biased, cheated by the prosecutes who fabricated lies to cater to the public, because the loss of 5 lives needed someone to be responsible for. But after 15 years, when the truth was presented, the public went to parade, they plead the court to free the four, they wanted to right the wrong. They were becoming rational, they felt for the innocent, so they acted. But this is not what happens here in China. The government is never transparent to the public, the media is censored so that cases like the Guildford 4 (especially if it is injustice) will never be known to the general public unless you are "in the business". Because the public is banning from first-hand information, people are unaware of government's wrongdoings; even if they are aware, there is almost nothing they can do (party monopoly, corruption all lead to this). So they kept silent, pretending nothing ever happened. I once read on a book, saying "silence is the most terrifying weapon". Today I have to admit this fact; but I want to say and plea to all my fellow citizens: pretending to be deaf doesn't mean that there is no voice in the society to be heard. They are merely sunk in the indifferent public. So please pay attention to politics, to events taking place in courts. Maybe someday we also will make cardboards with slogans on then and march in streets. Efforts from individuals could gather to really make change.

    Sometimes i say to myself "this can't happen to me" for the simple reason that it sounds really unfair to be happening..But watching a movie like this changes all perception of right and wrong, fair and unfair.. Only thing that can be fair in this world is your HEART !! Though Daniel Day Lewis' character is not your typical role model from the start, you know that the Heart within isn't black (more so from a scene just before he says 'In all my godforsaken life, I've never known what it was to kill somebody until now')..The transformation of Day Lewis' character from a man who wasn't responsible enough to take care of himself to a man who vows to fight for his father's name is brilliantly heartwarming! It just pains me to see how cruel 'WE' as a species can be to not accept our mistakes, even when we know that it can make someone's life miserable than HELL!! In all the movie is good till the time you don't think of it as someone's life being played out in front of you.As soon as you realize that,it transforms into something you cant just think of as just another brilliant movie.Instead your heart goes out to the people who actually had to go through all this.. Well directed, superbly acted, brilliant,heart breaking and heart warming at the same time !! Those who found it beautiful can go for 'Conviction' as their next choice of another heartwarming 'eye treat' !

    If you ever wanted a tutorial on perfect acting, In the Name of the Father is the perfect film to turn to. This is a very powerful film that features perhaps some of the best acting of the 1990's. This is a film, although somewhat historically inaccurate, will make viewers weep at times and cheer for the characters at other times. I have rarely seen a movie so powerful and uplifting but heart-wrenching as well. Jim Sheridan's film is about the Guilford Four and how they were wrongfully implicated by the British for an IRA bombing. The supposed leader, Gerry Conlon is sent to life in prison and is joined by his father. Together, for the next fifteen years, they do what they can to prove they're innocent and gain their freedom. Daniel-Day Lewis. Just reading that name aloud gives me goosebumps. He is the greatest actor of our generation if not the best of all time. He gives another masterful performance as Gerry Conlon. He is truly the best method actor I have ever seen. Pete Postlethwaite gives the strongest performance of his career as Gerry's caring but stern father. Emma Thompson doesn't have much screen time until the end but her screen time is well worth the wait. Overall, this is one of the best films of a decade that features some of the best film-making in cinema history. I'm glad to say this film would have joined their ranks. Even the most stern grouch would be in tears at the end of the film. I feel bad that Daniel did not take home the Oscar for the film even though Tom Hanks deserves it for his performance in Philadelphia. I rate this film 10/10.

    A man's coerced confession to an IRA bombing he didn't do imprisons his father as well; a British lawyer helps fight for their freedom. From director Jim Sheridan, comes an outstanding movie based on the true story of the Guildford Four, who were falsely accused of a pub bombing and were given lengthy prison sentences. In The Name Of The Father is an excellent movie, it's greatly acted, powerfully written, masterfully directed, and a whole lot more. And I'm not saying this as somebody who loves movies, I'm saying this as somebody who is determined to see movies that are hailed as some of the greatest of all time, and In The Name Of The Father is definitely one of those. I'm not kidding at all, this movie is absolutely stupendous, it is one of the best movies of 1993, and overall, one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie is outstanding, but in some parts it's sad, and in other parts, it's got the mood of a great feel good movie. In directing this movie, Jim Sheridan has made a masterpiece. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a performance that is like no other Daniel Day-Lewis performance that I have ever seen. Rather than playing the hero (like he did in The Last Of The Mohicans) or the villain (like he did in Gangs Of New York and There Will Be Blood), he plays Gerry Conlon, a man who gets caught up in a torrent of trouble and is wrongfully sent to prison for a crime he did not commit, Day-Lewis plays him so perfectly, that we can actually feel his sorrow and despair. The late Pete Postlethwaite was just about the same in his performance as Giuseppe Conlon, and so is Emma Thompson as Gareth Peirce, Gerry Conlon's lawyer who's trying to prove his innocence. Basically, the entire cast gave great performances, with Postlethwaite, Thompson and especially, Day-Lewis all being the best. Daniel Day-Lewis is a man who can do no wrong, I have yet to see him in a bad movie. In other words, that man is a living sensation. In The Name Of The Father is required viewing, as you will see Daniel Day-Lewis in a role that is totally unlike many of his other roles, you will say that he is absolutely stunning, you will say that he has given another one of his best performances. And you will most likely say the same thing about the movie as a whole, you will say that this movie is a masterpiece, that it's one of the best movies of all time, and many other things too. I'm very glad that I have such a wide variety in movies, because I've have been able to see movies that are hailed as some of the best of all time, and when I watched them, I agree with the common consensus. And that goes with In The Name Of The Father too, I agree that this movie is a masterpiece and that it's one of the best of the 1990's. So if you've not yet seen this fabulous film, then you've got to see it, because it IS fabulous, and when you watch it, you will perfectly see what I mean. 10/10

    IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER Andy Dufresne of Shawshank Redemption escaped with perseverance. Prison Break. John Abraham of New York came out. In silence. Then went on to become a terrorist. While Gerard Conlon; well he got his case dismissed and got the Majesty by her womanly balls. In the Name of the Father is the real life story of Gerard Conlon who along with many others was taken in under the dastardly Prevention of Terrorism Act enforced by the House of Commons in 1975 British during the war against I.R.A. for the Guildford bombings. It brings to the silverscreen a shocking and terrific portrayal of the infamous case spread over a span of 15 years affecting the lives of both the supposed guilty and their near and dear ones. Daniel Day Lewis is exceptional in this film as Gerard Conlon as also Pete Postlethwaite as his father Guiseppe. Jim Sheridan has wonderfully directed the movie with the perfect music to bring his vision of the truth to life. Watch out for the scene where Like A Rolling Stone starts in the film. This legendary song marked off the beginning of the film. As if Bob Dylan's wife set this film (read stone) rolling which only became faster and more gripping by the minute. The editing is crisp. The pace is breathtaking. While the cinematography works wonders with the company of music. The scene where The Godfather's music is in the background is a masterstroke to this clever film. That music brought an immense sense of power to that scene. As if making it reek with a ready to pounce horror. So what's wrong with the movie? Emma Thompson as Gareth. Her portrayal of the lawyer was slowing the pace whenever she came on screen. Except for the final courtroom scene where she was just unreal. Masterly in her performance only then. Another major flaw was the total disappearance of Gerard's sisters in the climax. All in all, this is one of the best courtroom-cum-prison-cum-terror-cum- biographical movies out there. The same year Schindler's List had released as also Philadelphia. Tom Hanks had edged Daniel for the best actor. It must have been so difficult for the Academy to hand out the Best Actor. Besides, it didn't get a single Oscar inspite of 7 nominations. This film is one among the unknown many. Terrific. Must-watch. Rating: 9/10, ****1/2 /5, 90/100

The arrests, torture, trial and sentences leaves an emotional impact on the unjust treatment and fate of all the accused and some performances here are to be commended. But Pete Postlethwaite's portrayal of Conlon's father breaks the shackles, elevates the emotional depth in the movies and justifies the title. The initial scene where Guiseppe pleads the IRA men to forgive his son, the expression on his face when Gerald returns from England, the conversations inside the prison cell and the scene just before he dies are a few examples of his masterful performance. I can understand at a biographical point of view for a very biased approach, but as a movie which deals with other characters as well should have shown some elements of thoughts leading up to the characters in the system do what they do. Daniel Day-Lewis is reliable as ever playing a real-life character that goes through a transformation from an energetic wild youth to an introspective determined son. Terrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite

    I am not British nor am I Irish. And, as far as 'the troubles' go, I don't have a very strong opinion one way or another. A lot of crazy stuff went on for so long and there's so much guilt, it's hard to take a side--though I sure hate the idea of terrorism. So, I am not a person with a dog in the fight, so to speak. I just thought I'd mention this so you don't think I had a particular stake in the film. The film is the story of Gerry Conlon, though it also affected his father, the rest of his family and some friends. Back during the heyday of IRA terrorism in the 1970s, the British were obviously very frustrated and were willing to go to some extreme methods to stop it--even if it meant suspending traditional constitutional rights. This is understandable but troubling. But what goes WAY beyond troubling were the methods used by the prosecutors and police to convict a group of people for a bombing--even when it turned out that they knew that the people were probably innocent! The film is essentially a showcase for Daniel Day-Lewis to show off his acting skills. However, the film also had lovely direction and was a first-class project all around. Well worth seeing--and there's a good chance this film might make you feel a little mad.

    (English is my second language, so please excuse my language problems:) Yes, I cried when other prisoners threw lighted papers from the window; yes, Daniel-Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite were great actors; but other than that, what impressed me most was the complete change of attitudes of the public between the two trials. At first, audience in the court were yelling "hang these Irish bastards", they were throwing all their hatred to the Guildford Four, even the judge said "I wonder why you are not charged as treason". They were biased, cheated by the prosecutes who fabricated lies to cater to the public, because the loss of 5 lives needed someone to be responsible for. But after 15 years, when the truth was presented, the public went to parade, they plead the court to free the four, they wanted to right the wrong. They were becoming rational, they felt for the innocent, so they acted. But this is not what happens here in China. The government is never transparent to the public, the media is censored so that cases like the Guildford 4 (especially if it is injustice) will never be known to the general public unless you are "in the business". Because the public is banning from first-hand information, people are unaware of government's wrongdoings; even if they are aware, there is almost nothing they can do (party monopoly, corruption all lead to this). So they kept silent, pretending nothing ever happened. I once read on a book, saying "silence is the most terrifying weapon". Today I have to admit this fact; but I want to say and plea to all my fellow citizens: pretending to be deaf doesn't mean that there is no voice in the society to be heard. They are merely sunk in the indifferent public. So please pay attention to politics, to events taking place in courts. Maybe someday we also will make cardboards with slogans on then and march in streets. Efforts from individuals could gather to really make change.

    Sometimes i say to myself "this can't happen to me" for the simple reason that it sounds really unfair to be happening..But watching a movie like this changes all perception of right and wrong, fair and unfair.. Only thing that can be fair in this world is your HEART !! Though Daniel Day Lewis' character is not your typical role model from the start, you know that the Heart within isn't black (more so from a scene just before he says 'In all my godforsaken life, I've never known what it was to kill somebody until now')..The transformation of Day Lewis' character from a man who wasn't responsible enough to take care of himself to a man who vows to fight for his father's name is brilliantly heartwarming! It just pains me to see how cruel 'WE' as a species can be to not accept our mistakes, even when we know that it can make someone's life miserable than HELL!! In all the movie is good till the time you don't think of it as someone's life being played out in front of you.As soon as you realize that,it transforms into something you cant just think of as just another brilliant movie.Instead your heart goes out to the people who actually had to go through all this.. Well directed, superbly acted, brilliant,heart breaking and heart warming at the same time !! Those who found it beautiful can go for 'Conviction' as their next choice of another heartwarming 'eye treat' !

    If you ever wanted a tutorial on perfect acting, In the Name of the Father is the perfect film to turn to. This is a very powerful film that features perhaps some of the best acting of the 1990's. This is a film, although somewhat historically inaccurate, will make viewers weep at times and cheer for the characters at other times. I have rarely seen a movie so powerful and uplifting but heart-wrenching as well. Jim Sheridan's film is about the Guilford Four and how they were wrongfully implicated by the British for an IRA bombing. The supposed leader, Gerry Conlon is sent to life in prison and is joined by his father. Together, for the next fifteen years, they do what they can to prove they're innocent and gain their freedom. Daniel-Day Lewis. Just reading that name aloud gives me goosebumps. He is the greatest actor of our generation if not the best of all time. He gives another masterful performance as Gerry Conlon. He is truly the best method actor I have ever seen. Pete Postlethwaite gives the strongest performance of his career as Gerry's caring but stern father. Emma Thompson doesn't have much screen time until the end but her screen time is well worth the wait. Overall, this is one of the best films of a decade that features some of the best film-making in cinema history. I'm glad to say this film would have joined their ranks. Even the most stern grouch would be in tears at the end of the film. I feel bad that Daniel did not take home the Oscar for the film even though Tom Hanks deserves it for his performance in Philadelphia. I rate this film 10/10.

    A man's coerced confession to an IRA bombing he didn't do imprisons his father as well; a British lawyer helps fight for their freedom. From director Jim Sheridan, comes an outstanding movie based on the true story of the Guildford Four, who were falsely accused of a pub bombing and were given lengthy prison sentences. In The Name Of The Father is an excellent movie, it's greatly acted, powerfully written, masterfully directed, and a whole lot more. And I'm not saying this as somebody who loves movies, I'm saying this as somebody who is determined to see movies that are hailed as some of the greatest of all time, and In The Name Of The Father is definitely one of those. I'm not kidding at all, this movie is absolutely stupendous, it is one of the best movies of 1993, and overall, one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie is outstanding, but in some parts it's sad, and in other parts, it's got the mood of a great feel good movie. In directing this movie, Jim Sheridan has made a masterpiece. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a performance that is like no other Daniel Day-Lewis performance that I have ever seen. Rather than playing the hero (like he did in The Last Of The Mohicans) or the villain (like he did in Gangs Of New York and There Will Be Blood), he plays Gerry Conlon, a man who gets caught up in a torrent of trouble and is wrongfully sent to prison for a crime he did not commit, Day-Lewis plays him so perfectly, that we can actually feel his sorrow and despair. The late Pete Postlethwaite was just about the same in his performance as Giuseppe Conlon, and so is Emma Thompson as Gareth Peirce, Gerry Conlon's lawyer who's trying to prove his innocence. Basically, the entire cast gave great performances, with Postlethwaite, Thompson and especially, Day-Lewis all being the best. Daniel Day-Lewis is a man who can do no wrong, I have yet to see him in a bad movie. In other words, that man is a living sensation. In The Name Of The Father is required viewing, as you will see Daniel Day-Lewis in a role that is totally unlike many of his other roles, you will say that he is absolutely stunning, you will say that he has given another one of his best performances. And you will most likely say the same thing about the movie as a whole, you will say that this movie is a masterpiece, that it's one of the best movies of all time, and many other things too. I'm very glad that I have such a wide variety in movies, because I've have been able to see movies that are hailed as some of the best of all time, and when I watched them, I agree with the common consensus. And that goes with In The Name Of The Father too, I agree that this movie is a masterpiece and that it's one of the best of the 1990's. So if you've not yet seen this fabulous film, then you've got to see it, because it IS fabulous, and when you watch it, you will perfectly see what I mean. 10/10

    IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER Andy Dufresne of Shawshank Redemption escaped with perseverance. Prison Break. John Abraham of New York came out. In silence. Then went on to become a terrorist. While Gerard Conlon; well he got his case dismissed and got the Majesty by her womanly balls. In the Name of the Father is the real life story of Gerard Conlon who along with many others was taken in under the dastardly Prevention of Terrorism Act enforced by the House of Commons in 1975 British during the war against I.R.A. for the Guildford bombings. It brings to the silverscreen a shocking and terrific portrayal of the infamous case spread over a span of 15 years affecting the lives of both the supposed guilty and their near and dear ones. Daniel Day Lewis is exceptional in this film as Gerard Conlon as also Pete Postlethwaite as his father Guiseppe. Jim Sheridan has wonderfully directed the movie with the perfect music to bring his vision of the truth to life. Watch out for the scene where Like A Rolling Stone starts in the film. This legendary song marked off the beginning of the film. As if Bob Dylan's wife set this film (read stone) rolling which only became faster and more gripping by the minute. The editing is crisp. The pace is breathtaking. While the cinematography works wonders with the company of music. The scene where The Godfather's music is in the background is a masterstroke to this clever film. That music brought an immense sense of power to that scene. As if making it reek with a ready to pounce horror. So what's wrong with the movie? Emma Thompson as Gareth. Her portrayal of the lawyer was slowing the pace whenever she came on screen. Except for the final courtroom scene where she was just unreal. Masterly in her performance only then. Another major flaw was the total disappearance of Gerard's sisters in the climax. All in all, this is one of the best courtroom-cum-prison-cum-terror-cum- biographical movies out there. The same year Schindler's List had released as also Philadelphia. Tom Hanks had edged Daniel for the best actor. It must have been so difficult for the Academy to hand out the Best Actor. Besides, it didn't get a single Oscar inspite of 7 nominations. This film is one among the unknown many. Terrific. Must-watch. Rating: 9/10, ****1/2 /5, 90/100

    After "My Left Foot", 1989' inspirational biopic of one of the most famous Irish artists, that received universal acclaim and earned his first Oscar to Daniel Day-Lewis, Jim Sheridan relates four years later another page of Irish history through "In the Name of the Father", a powerful and solid drama comforting Day-Lewis' reputation as one of the most talented actors of his generation. "In the Name of the Father", chronicles the events that lead to the arrest of the infamous 'Guildford Four': four Irish people falsely accused and convicted for the bombing of the London pub of the same name. It's a nice directorial touch that the film opens with the explosion that killed five innocent persons, the very action that would imply a vengeance- ridden reaction from the British law. Innocent people would then pay for the crime, and this is the tragedy of Gerard Patrick Conlon, a feckless Irish lead stealer, who was in London at the wrong place, at the wrong moment. Yet even as a true story, the injustice and level of sadism displayed by the British Police, with the relative complicity of the Court, seem unbelievable, flirting with the most one- dimensional kind of cinematic Manichaeism. This is where the context plays a crucial role: after a series of bombing terrorizing the British population, the Parliament voted a Terrorism Act allowing the Police to arrest suspects for seven days. Although the use of torture was prohibited, any other kind of pressure became legitimate and could be used to force the suspects to sign a confession, or their own convictions' papers. We're in a sort of post September-11 like paranoia, where the British system, lacking all the necessary perspective to properly investigate the case would spot the perfect scapegoats to compensate their own ineffectiveness. Any rational mind wouldn't believe an IRA bomber or criminal mastermind would rob a prostitute and goes back to his home like Gerry did. But those were irrational, fear-induced times. The torture scenes benefits from the spectacular performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, as the tough hoodlum reveals a vulnerable side, demonstrating innocence in every single meaning of the word. The nervous breakdown is inevitable, marking the triumph of the sadist Police officer played by Corin Redgrave, followed by a tragic domino effect. Gerry's friends and family are all arrested, including his father Giuseppe, a honest, hard- working and sensible man. It was Giuseppe who encouraged Gerry to leave Belfast for London, fearing an arrest because of his illegal activities. And Giuseppe, the character who revealed the immense actor who was the late Pete Potlewhaite, is the soul of the film. He incarnates both the educational background of Gerry: an apparent failure, and a constant guiding force meant to elevate his son, to a level of dignity despite the adversity. The titular father is Giuseppe, and the gap between him and Gerry would trace the line of Gerry's evolution and understanding process, the ultimate key of his moral triumph. The roots of Day-Lewis' torments are to have given up the conflict against the system for the more convenient one: his father, the one who holds for being responsible of all his faults. By constantly patronizing him, Giuseppe forged Gerry's rebellious instinct. Gerry lost self- respect by blaming everything on his father. He never shared room with him, but this one fictionalization is perhaps the strike of genius because the best moments of the film all focus on the father-and-son relationship. Giuseppe accepts fate as it comes while Gerry fights back without thinking. Gradually, Gerry's experience will reveal the limits of his own perceptions, even when it comes to the Irish responsibilities. The jail scenes plays a powerful counterpart to the black-and-white depiction of the British justice and are also the setting of the greatest and most emotional performances from the trio Day-Lewis, Postlewhaite and Emma Thompson as the British lawyer who'd reopen the case and allow the 'Guildford Four' to be rejudged, for an immediate release, fifteen years after the first sentence. Giuseppe would never be a free man and his death from pulmonary condition would forge the spirit of his son and give a meaning to his fight for Justice. Jim Sheridan's film is a powerful human drama featuring a magnificent and emotionally gripping metamorphosis of the central character. However, the film suffers from a few flaws on the scenes' arrangements, a criticism I also had with "My Left Foot" whose clumsy editing left a few interrogation marks, notably on the relationship between Day-Lewis and his father. "In the Name of the Father" seems so eager to be a poignant father-and-son story, a character study that the trial part was treated with more rush, only leveraged by the powerful acting of Daniel Day-Lewis. A few less scenes would have allowed to focus on Thompson's investigation, and prevent the final trial from its rather abrupt or anticlimactic feeling, maybe less the trial than the way the pivotal evidence were found. However, this is rather a regret than a criticism, the film still relies on Day-Lewis tour de force and his believable transition from a young self-centered thug to a man who'd do his best to Honor the memory of his father It's fitting that one of the scenes feature "The Godfather", especially the garden moment between Vito and Michael as the very scene represented the succession between the two persons, the transmission of heritage, between Giuseppe and his son, the transmission of common values. Conlon's personal fight would be to find out the part of him he had in common with his father, and make the most of it. In the Name of His Father.

    In the Name of the Father tells a pretty horrifying tale of several people who were wrongly accused of the Guildford bombings. It's admirably written and directed, and there's enough here to allow you to really feel for the characters involved. As it is, it strongly reminds me A Cry in the Dark, another similar biographical film about an unfortunate turn of events starring Meryl Streep. Both films work as much as they do because of their central performances, in this case Daniel Day Lewis, who is truly fantastic. Ultimately, this is an effective film that is worthy of a viewing, although I don't think it's overall as effective as A Cry in the Dark, if maybe for obvious reasons of the tragedy in the latter being worse.

    Despite good acting, I didn't really care much about the main character. Lots of pain and struggle, but it wasn't touching or whatever that magical quality is that makes a person WANT to watch the pain of a drama. I gave up halfway through. wasn't worth the time and frustration. The picture quality sucked. Hook it up to your stereo, blast the volume, and then listen to the voices as a whisper. This gritty, gut-wrenching film was difficult to watch then and has remained so even with the passage of almost 20years. Sure the politics of the period featured heavily but for me the movie was about the turbulent love that existed between father and son.

    A movie not without its flaws with a biased unidimensional perspective based on the biography by Gerry Conlon one of the accused from Guildford Four. While the overall story is commercialized and worked around for dramatic effect, Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the protagonist's father was too good in some scenes. Though it is competently performed, well written and executed, the battle is already half won with just the knowledge on the premise and the ordeal the Guildford four and Maguire seven have been through in real life. Based on real life events following Gerald Conlon ( Daniel Day-Lewis) a carefree wild youth who is accused of the Guildford bombing and imprisoned after coerced confession. This leads to arrests of his aunt's family infamously known as the Maguire Seven along with his father Guiseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), a just man trying to protect his son. After his father's death due to harsh prison environment and depression, he vows to fight back on the system with the help of a convinced lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson). The initial riot sequence was exhilarating pepped by a solid background score and hysterical atmosphere. The arrests, torture, trial and sentences leaves an emotional impact on the unjust treatment and fate of all the accused and some performances here are to be commended. But Pete Postlethwaite's portrayal of Conlon's father breaks the shackles, elevates the emotional depth in the movies and justifies the title. The initial scene where Guiseppe pleads the IRA men to forgive his son, the expression on his face when Gerald returns from England, the conversations inside the prison cell and the scene just before he dies are a few examples of his masterful performance. I can understand at a biographical point of view for a very biased approach, but as a movie which deals with other characters as well should have shown some elements of thoughts leading up to the characters in the system do what they do. Daniel Day-Lewis is reliable as ever playing a real-life character that goes through a transformation from an energetic wild youth to an introspective determined son.

This movie is outstanding, but in some parts it's sad, and in other parts, it's got the mood of a great feel good movie. In directing this movie, Jim Sheridan has made a masterpiece. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a performance that is like no other Daniel Day-Lewis performance that I have ever seen. Rather than playing the hero (like he did in The Last Of The Mohicans) or the villain (like he did in Gangs Of New York and There Will Be Blood), he plays Gerry Conlon, a man who gets caught up in a torrent of trouble and is wrongfully sent to prison for a crime he did not commit, Day-Lewis plays him so perfectly, that we can actually feel his sorrow and despair. The late Pete Postlethwaite was just about the same in his performance as Giuseppe Conlon, and so is Emma Thompson as Gareth Peirce, Gerry Conlon's lawyer who's trying to prove his innocence. Basically, the entire cast gave great performances, with Postlethwaite, Thompson and especially, Day-Lewis all being the best. Daniel Day-Lewis is a man who can do no wrong, I have yet to see him in a bad movie. In other words, that man is a living sensation. In The Name Of The Father is required viewing, as you will see Daniel Day-Lewis in a role that is totally unlike many of his other roles, you will say that he is absolutely stunning, you will say that he has given another one of his best performances. And you will most likely say the same thing about the movie as a whole, you will say that this movie is a masterpiece, that it's one of the best movies of all time, and many other things too. I'm very glad that I have such a wide variety in movies, because I've have been able to see movies that are hailed as some of the best of all time, and when I watched them, I agree with the common consensus. And that goes with In The Name Of The Father too, I agree that this movie is a masterpiece and that it's one of the best of the 1990's. So if you've not yet seen this fabulous film, then you've got to see it, because it IS fabulous, and when you watch it, you will perfectly see what I mean. 10/10

    IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER Andy Dufresne of Shawshank Redemption escaped with perseverance. Prison Break. John Abraham of New York came out. In silence. Then went on to become a terrorist. While Gerard Conlon; well he got his case dismissed and got the Majesty by her womanly balls. In the Name of the Father is the real life story of Gerard Conlon who along with many others was taken in under the dastardly Prevention of Terrorism Act enforced by the House of Commons in 1975 British during the war against I.R.A. for the Guildford bombings. It brings to the silverscreen a shocking and terrific portrayal of the infamous case spread over a span of 15 years affecting the lives of both the supposed guilty and their near and dear ones. Daniel Day Lewis is exceptional in this film as Gerard Conlon as also Pete Postlethwaite as his father Guiseppe. Jim Sheridan has wonderfully directed the movie with the perfect music to bring his vision of the truth to life. Watch out for the scene where Like A Rolling Stone starts in the film. This legendary song marked off the beginning of the film. As if Bob Dylan's wife set this film (read stone) rolling which only became faster and more gripping by the minute. The editing is crisp. The pace is breathtaking. While the cinematography works wonders with the company of music. The scene where The Godfather's music is in the background is a masterstroke to this clever film. That music brought an immense sense of power to that scene. As if making it reek with a ready to pounce horror. So what's wrong with the movie? Emma Thompson as Gareth. Her portrayal of the lawyer was slowing the pace whenever she came on screen. Except for the final courtroom scene where she was just unreal. Masterly in her performance only then. Another major flaw was the total disappearance of Gerard's sisters in the climax. All in all, this is one of the best courtroom-cum-prison-cum-terror-cum- biographical movies out there. The same year Schindler's List had released as also Philadelphia. Tom Hanks had edged Daniel for the best actor. It must have been so difficult for the Academy to hand out the Best Actor. Besides, it didn't get a single Oscar inspite of 7 nominations. This film is one among the unknown many. Terrific. Must-watch. Rating: 9/10, ****1/2 /5, 90/100

    After "My Left Foot", 1989' inspirational biopic of one of the most famous Irish artists, that received universal acclaim and earned his first Oscar to Daniel Day-Lewis, Jim Sheridan relates four years later another page of Irish history through "In the Name of the Father", a powerful and solid drama comforting Day-Lewis' reputation as one of the most talented actors of his generation. "In the Name of the Father", chronicles the events that lead to the arrest of the infamous 'Guildford Four': four Irish people falsely accused and convicted for the bombing of the London pub of the same name. It's a nice directorial touch that the film opens with the explosion that killed five innocent persons, the very action that would imply a vengeance- ridden reaction from the British law. Innocent people would then pay for the crime, and this is the tragedy of Gerard Patrick Conlon, a feckless Irish lead stealer, who was in London at the wrong place, at the wrong moment. Yet even as a true story, the injustice and level of sadism displayed by the British Police, with the relative complicity of the Court, seem unbelievable, flirting with the most one- dimensional kind of cinematic Manichaeism. This is where the context plays a crucial role: after a series of bombing terrorizing the British population, the Parliament voted a Terrorism Act allowing the Police to arrest suspects for seven days. Although the use of torture was prohibited, any other kind of pressure became legitimate and could be used to force the suspects to sign a confession, or their own convictions' papers. We're in a sort of post September-11 like paranoia, where the British system, lacking all the necessary perspective to properly investigate the case would spot the perfect scapegoats to compensate their own ineffectiveness. Any rational mind wouldn't believe an IRA bomber or criminal mastermind would rob a prostitute and goes back to his home like Gerry did. But those were irrational, fear-induced times. The torture scenes benefits from the spectacular performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, as the tough hoodlum reveals a vulnerable side, demonstrating innocence in every single meaning of the word. The nervous breakdown is inevitable, marking the triumph of the sadist Police officer played by Corin Redgrave, followed by a tragic domino effect. Gerry's friends and family are all arrested, including his father Giuseppe, a honest, hard- working and sensible man. It was Giuseppe who encouraged Gerry to leave Belfast for London, fearing an arrest because of his illegal activities. And Giuseppe, the character who revealed the immense actor who was the late Pete Potlewhaite, is the soul of the film. He incarnates both the educational background of Gerry: an apparent failure, and a constant guiding force meant to elevate his son, to a level of dignity despite the adversity. The titular father is Giuseppe, and the gap between him and Gerry would trace the line of Gerry's evolution and understanding process, the ultimate key of his moral triumph. The roots of Day-Lewis' torments are to have given up the conflict against the system for the more convenient one: his father, the one who holds for being responsible of all his faults. By constantly patronizing him, Giuseppe forged Gerry's rebellious instinct. Gerry lost self- respect by blaming everything on his father. He never shared room with him, but this one fictionalization is perhaps the strike of genius because the best moments of the film all focus on the father-and-son relationship. Giuseppe accepts fate as it comes while Gerry fights back without thinking. Gradually, Gerry's experience will reveal the limits of his own perceptions, even when it comes to the Irish responsibilities. The jail scenes plays a powerful counterpart to the black-and-white depiction of the British justice and are also the setting of the greatest and most emotional performances from the trio Day-Lewis, Postlewhaite and Emma Thompson as the British lawyer who'd reopen the case and allow the 'Guildford Four' to be rejudged, for an immediate release, fifteen years after the first sentence. Giuseppe would never be a free man and his death from pulmonary condition would forge the spirit of his son and give a meaning to his fight for Justice. Jim Sheridan's film is a powerful human drama featuring a magnificent and emotionally gripping metamorphosis of the central character. However, the film suffers from a few flaws on the scenes' arrangements, a criticism I also had with "My Left Foot" whose clumsy editing left a few interrogation marks, notably on the relationship between Day-Lewis and his father. "In the Name of the Father" seems so eager to be a poignant father-and-son story, a character study that the trial part was treated with more rush, only leveraged by the powerful acting of Daniel Day-Lewis. A few less scenes would have allowed to focus on Thompson's investigation, and prevent the final trial from its rather abrupt or anticlimactic feeling, maybe less the trial than the way the pivotal evidence were found. However, this is rather a regret than a criticism, the film still relies on Day-Lewis tour de force and his believable transition from a young self-centered thug to a man who'd do his best to Honor the memory of his father It's fitting that one of the scenes feature "The Godfather", especially the garden moment between Vito and Michael as the very scene represented the succession between the two persons, the transmission of heritage, between Giuseppe and his son, the transmission of common values. Conlon's personal fight would be to find out the part of him he had in common with his father, and make the most of it. In the Name of His Father.

    In the Name of the Father tells a pretty horrifying tale of several people who were wrongly accused of the Guildford bombings. It's admirably written and directed, and there's enough here to allow you to really feel for the characters involved. As it is, it strongly reminds me A Cry in the Dark, another similar biographical film about an unfortunate turn of events starring Meryl Streep. Both films work as much as they do because of their central performances, in this case Daniel Day Lewis, who is truly fantastic. Ultimately, this is an effective film that is worthy of a viewing, although I don't think it's overall as effective as A Cry in the Dark, if maybe for obvious reasons of the tragedy in the latter being worse.

    Despite good acting, I didn't really care much about the main character. Lots of pain and struggle, but it wasn't touching or whatever that magical quality is that makes a person WANT to watch the pain of a drama. I gave up halfway through. wasn't worth the time and frustration. The picture quality sucked. Hook it up to your stereo, blast the volume, and then listen to the voices as a whisper. This gritty, gut-wrenching film was difficult to watch then and has remained so even with the passage of almost 20years. Sure the politics of the period featured heavily but for me the movie was about the turbulent love that existed between father and son.

    A movie not without its flaws with a biased unidimensional perspective based on the biography by Gerry Conlon one of the accused from Guildford Four. While the overall story is commercialized and worked around for dramatic effect, Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the protagonist's father was too good in some scenes. Though it is competently performed, well written and executed, the battle is already half won with just the knowledge on the premise and the ordeal the Guildford four and Maguire seven have been through in real life. Based on real life events following Gerald Conlon ( Daniel Day-Lewis) a carefree wild youth who is accused of the Guildford bombing and imprisoned after coerced confession. This leads to arrests of his aunt's family infamously known as the Maguire Seven along with his father Guiseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), a just man trying to protect his son. After his father's death due to harsh prison environment and depression, he vows to fight back on the system with the help of a convinced lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson). The initial riot sequence was exhilarating pepped by a solid background score and hysterical atmosphere. The arrests, torture, trial and sentences leaves an emotional impact on the unjust treatment and fate of all the accused and some performances here are to be commended. But Pete Postlethwaite's portrayal of Conlon's father breaks the shackles, elevates the emotional depth in the movies and justifies the title. The initial scene where Guiseppe pleads the IRA men to forgive his son, the expression on his face when Gerald returns from England, the conversations inside the prison cell and the scene just before he dies are a few examples of his masterful performance. I can understand at a biographical point of view for a very biased approach, but as a movie which deals with other characters as well should have shown some elements of thoughts leading up to the characters in the system do what they do. Daniel Day-Lewis is reliable as ever playing a real-life character that goes through a transformation from an energetic wild youth to an introspective determined son. Terrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite

    I am not British nor am I Irish. And, as far as 'the troubles' go, I don't have a very strong opinion one way or another. A lot of crazy stuff went on for so long and there's so much guilt, it's hard to take a side--though I sure hate the idea of terrorism. So, I am not a person with a dog in the fight, so to speak. I just thought I'd mention this so you don't think I had a particular stake in the film. The film is the story of Gerry Conlon, though it also affected his father, the rest of his family and some friends. Back during the heyday of IRA terrorism in the 1970s, the British were obviously very frustrated and were willing to go to some extreme methods to stop it--even if it meant suspending traditional constitutional rights. This is understandable but troubling. But what goes WAY beyond troubling were the methods used by the prosecutors and police to convict a group of people for a bombing--even when it turned out that they knew that the people were probably innocent! The film is essentially a showcase for Daniel Day-Lewis to show off his acting skills. However, the film also had lovely direction and was a first-class project all around. Well worth seeing--and there's a good chance this film might make you feel a little mad.

    (English is my second language, so please excuse my language problems:) Yes, I cried when other prisoners threw lighted papers from the window; yes, Daniel-Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite were great actors; but other than that, what impressed me most was the complete change of attitudes of the public between the two trials. At first, audience in the court were yelling "hang these Irish bastards", they were throwing all their hatred to the Guildford Four, even the judge said "I wonder why you are not charged as treason". They were biased, cheated by the prosecutes who fabricated lies to cater to the public, because the loss of 5 lives needed someone to be responsible for. But after 15 years, when the truth was presented, the public went to parade, they plead the court to free the four, they wanted to right the wrong. They were becoming rational, they felt for the innocent, so they acted. But this is not what happens here in China. The government is never transparent to the public, the media is censored so that cases like the Guildford 4 (especially if it is injustice) will never be known to the general public unless you are "in the business". Because the public is banning from first-hand information, people are unaware of government's wrongdoings; even if they are aware, there is almost nothing they can do (party monopoly, corruption all lead to this). So they kept silent, pretending nothing ever happened. I once read on a book, saying "silence is the most terrifying weapon". Today I have to admit this fact; but I want to say and plea to all my fellow citizens: pretending to be deaf doesn't mean that there is no voice in the society to be heard. They are merely sunk in the indifferent public. So please pay attention to politics, to events taking place in courts. Maybe someday we also will make cardboards with slogans on then and march in streets. Efforts from individuals could gather to really make change.

    Sometimes i say to myself "this can't happen to me" for the simple reason that it sounds really unfair to be happening..But watching a movie like this changes all perception of right and wrong, fair and unfair.. Only thing that can be fair in this world is your HEART !! Though Daniel Day Lewis' character is not your typical role model from the start, you know that the Heart within isn't black (more so from a scene just before he says 'In all my godforsaken life, I've never known what it was to kill somebody until now')..The transformation of Day Lewis' character from a man who wasn't responsible enough to take care of himself to a man who vows to fight for his father's name is brilliantly heartwarming! It just pains me to see how cruel 'WE' as a species can be to not accept our mistakes, even when we know that it can make someone's life miserable than HELL!! In all the movie is good till the time you don't think of it as someone's life being played out in front of you.As soon as you realize that,it transforms into something you cant just think of as just another brilliant movie.Instead your heart goes out to the people who actually had to go through all this.. Well directed, superbly acted, brilliant,heart breaking and heart warming at the same time !! Those who found it beautiful can go for 'Conviction' as their next choice of another heartwarming 'eye treat' !

    If you ever wanted a tutorial on perfect acting, In the Name of the Father is the perfect film to turn to. This is a very powerful film that features perhaps some of the best acting of the 1990's. This is a film, although somewhat historically inaccurate, will make viewers weep at times and cheer for the characters at other times. I have rarely seen a movie so powerful and uplifting but heart-wrenching as well. Jim Sheridan's film is about the Guilford Four and how they were wrongfully implicated by the British for an IRA bombing. The supposed leader, Gerry Conlon is sent to life in prison and is joined by his father. Together, for the next fifteen years, they do what they can to prove they're innocent and gain their freedom. Daniel-Day Lewis. Just reading that name aloud gives me goosebumps. He is the greatest actor of our generation if not the best of all time. He gives another masterful performance as Gerry Conlon. He is truly the best method actor I have ever seen. Pete Postlethwaite gives the strongest performance of his career as Gerry's caring but stern father. Emma Thompson doesn't have much screen time until the end but her screen time is well worth the wait. Overall, this is one of the best films of a decade that features some of the best film-making in cinema history. I'm glad to say this film would have joined their ranks. Even the most stern grouch would be in tears at the end of the film. I feel bad that Daniel did not take home the Oscar for the film even though Tom Hanks deserves it for his performance in Philadelphia. I rate this film 10/10.

    A man's coerced confession to an IRA bombing he didn't do imprisons his father as well; a British lawyer helps fight for their freedom. From director Jim Sheridan, comes an outstanding movie based on the true story of the Guildford Four, who were falsely accused of a pub bombing and were given lengthy prison sentences. In The Name Of The Father is an excellent movie, it's greatly acted, powerfully written, masterfully directed, and a whole lot more. And I'm not saying this as somebody who loves movies, I'm saying this as somebody who is determined to see movies that are hailed as some of the greatest of all time, and In The Name Of The Father is definitely one of those. I'm not kidding at all, this movie is absolutely stupendous, it is one of the best movies of 1993, and overall, one of the best movies I've ever seen.

Daniel Day-Lewis is a man who can do no wrong, I have yet to see him in a bad movie. In other words, that man is a living sensation. In The Name Of The Father is required viewing, as you will see Daniel Day-Lewis in a role that is totally unlike many of his other roles, you will say that he is absolutely stunning, you will say that he has given another one of his best performances.

However, this is rather a regret than a criticism, the film still relies on Day-Lewis tour de force and his believable transition from a young self-centered thug to a man who'd do his best to Honor the memory of his father It's fitting that one of the scenes feature "The Godfather", especially the garden moment between Vito and Michael as the very scene represented the succession between the two persons, the transmission of heritage, between Giuseppe and his son, the transmission of common values. Conlon's personal fight would be to find out the part of him he had in common with his father, and make the most of it. In the Name of His Father.

    In the Name of the Father tells a pretty horrifying tale of several people who were wrongly accused of the Guildford bombings. It's admirably written and directed, and there's enough here to allow you to really feel for the characters involved. As it is, it strongly reminds me A Cry in the Dark, another similar biographical film about an unfortunate turn of events starring Meryl Streep. Both films work as much as they do because of their central performances, in this case Daniel Day Lewis, who is truly fantastic. Ultimately, this is an effective film that is worthy of a viewing, although I don't think it's overall as effective as A Cry in the Dark, if maybe for obvious reasons of the tragedy in the latter being worse.

    Despite good acting, I didn't really care much about the main character. Lots of pain and struggle, but it wasn't touching or whatever that magical quality is that makes a person WANT to watch the pain of a drama. I gave up halfway through. wasn't worth the time and frustration. The picture quality sucked. Hook it up to your stereo, blast the volume, and then listen to the voices as a whisper. This gritty, gut-wrenching film was difficult to watch then and has remained so even with the passage of almost 20years. Sure the politics of the period featured heavily but for me the movie was about the turbulent love that existed between father and son.

    A movie not without its flaws with a biased unidimensional perspective based on the biography by Gerry Conlon one of the accused from Guildford Four. While the overall story is commercialized and worked around for dramatic effect, Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the protagonist's father was too good in some scenes. Though it is competently performed, well written and executed, the battle is already half won with just the knowledge on the premise and the ordeal the Guildford four and Maguire seven have been through in real life. Based on real life events following Gerald Conlon ( Daniel Day-Lewis) a carefree wild youth who is accused of the Guildford bombing and imprisoned after coerced confession. This leads to arrests of his aunt's family infamously known as the Maguire Seven along with his father Guiseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), a just man trying to protect his son. After his father's death due to harsh prison environment and depression, he vows to fight back on the system with the help of a convinced lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson). The initial riot sequence was exhilarating pepped by a solid background score and hysterical atmosphere. The arrests, torture, trial and sentences leaves an emotional impact on the unjust treatment and fate of all the accused and some performances here are to be commended. But Pete Postlethwaite's portrayal of Conlon's father breaks the shackles, elevates the emotional depth in the movies and justifies the title. The initial scene where Guiseppe pleads the IRA men to forgive his son, the expression on his face when Gerald returns from England, the conversations inside the prison cell and the scene just before he dies are a few examples of his masterful performance. I can understand at a biographical point of view for a very biased approach, but as a movie which deals with other characters as well should have shown some elements of thoughts leading up to the characters in the system do what they do. Daniel Day-Lewis is reliable as ever playing a real-life character that goes through a transformation from an energetic wild youth to an introspective determined son.
