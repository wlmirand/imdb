    Country-girl, Gugino meets rock 'n' roller, surfer-dude (comedian Pauly Shore) while attending college in California; they fall in love (for reasons that remain a mystery to the audience) and she brings him back to the farm to meet his future in-laws. Shore spends most of the film's running-time making animal noises and pronouncing words in a slightly unconventional manner because the writers couldn't be bothered to come up with any jokes. To top it off, the leading lady is also a bitch who heartlessly dumps her boyfriend for the sake of our "charming" genetic- defect, and while this movie does try to justify this by making him a cheater. The problem is, she doesn't find out until the end, so for all she knew, she could have been breaking the heart of an innocent man. Let me tell help you out here movie; merely making one character an ass doesn't exempt the other from being a bitch. Also, merely exaggerating the length of a word (buuuuuuuudy) isn't funny. Lazy humor at it's, err, laziest.

    This comedy will go down as a classic, just like Caddyshack, Meatball's and, UncleBuck to name a few. The first time I saw this movie I rented it. I thought well this looks like a winner and it was. Today it is hard to find a comedy that will make you laugh just like the one's from the 1970' and 1980's. It came out in 1993 and I can relate to this movie because that was the time I was in college too. It begin's with Becka going off to college, in California. Enven though her father Walter, played by Lane Smith, tries his best to change her mind and go to college in South Dakota. She goes to California where it's kinda a culture shock for her; and she hates it at first wanting to come home home. The RA played by Pauly Shore talks her out of it and she has made her 1st friend and saved herself from a mistake. The movie then gets close to Thanksgiving and the coming home to see her family and face the fact that her boyfriend from home might propose to her. She finds out that Crawl, Pauly Shore, will be staying on campus through the holiday. She kinda feels sorry for him; asks him to come home with her. She feels this is a way to get to know her family and also to get out of saying I do when she doesn't. When arriving home her family R shocked by her and Crawl. She's changed her appearance and feels relieved. The family freaks out by what she's done and at first can't stand Crawl, especially Walter. It takes awhile for the family to accept what she's done and it takes them longer to accept Crawl as a friend and supposedly a family member. When they go to dinner at a party of some kind her boyfriend tries to propose and Crawl gets in the way. He claims that he already asked her to marry him. Both he and Becka play along and as the movie goes along the Walter starts to warm up to Crawl, especially after the square dancing party. The next day Crawl goes fishing with Walter Sr. and Walter Jr., Lane Smith. They start to bond by talking about Walter's relationship with his father. The next thing they are talking when granddad appears to be having a heart attack. They, Crawl and Walter run to his aid. While Walter runs to get his father's pills, Crawl begins to attempt CPR on Walts dad thinking he needed it. When he begins to give him mouth-to mouth they both scare the s**t out of each other,"This was one of the funniest parts of the movie" When Walter asked his what happened, Crawl explains, he was trying to give his dad CPR, because he majored in it for a semester, he knew what he was doing. When they got home Crawl knew they both bonded and realized he needed to tell the truth but how. When Crawl goes th his bachelor party it gets worse. He gets drugged by the farm hand Theo and Becka's boyfriend. The next morning he wakes up in the barn with Beck's school chum. Beck'a finds them both and freaks, and tells her parents what happened. We come to fiend out this was a ploy for Becka's boyfriend to win he back and it eventually fails. The truth comes out in the end with an awesome ending. This movie is a great movie for the whole family. Pauly Shore and Lane Smith, winning pair. I believe this was one of Lane Smith's best movies and he is Hilario's too. Today he is missed but he will never be forgotten. The whole cast was great, but Lane Smith was tops, he kept me laughing to the end. This is a great comedy with a great ending you will not be disappointed :). Kris L. CocKayne :)

    When it comes to Son in Law, it's a mixed bag. Its premise is cute, but its delivery is a little strange. It's a comedy with Pauly Shore, so you're not going to get very clever humor. You're going to get below the belt jokes a lot of the time which is perfectly acceptable. As long as you know what you're getting into, you have no right to complain about the jokes. Now do the jokes work? Most of them do, but most don't come from the lead actor/actress. The most jokes come from the girl's brother played by Patrick Renna, famous from The Sandlot. Such a weird little thing to say that the character in the movie who isn't on the cover or mentioned anywhere on the back is the funniest character in the film. And, at the time, he was only known for his role in The Sandlot and I doubt many kids who took the time to see that film did the same for this one. The film is about a farm girl named Rebecca Warner (Guigino) leaving her South Dakota farm to go to College in California. Her parents, mainly her father (Smith), are skeptical about this College and worry that is may tamper with her original roots. She meets Crawl (Shore) who is the residential adviser of her dorm. Crawl is an off the wall kind of friend, and Rebecca thinks it's brilliant to bring him home to her strict family. In California, Crawl fits right in. In South Dakota, Crawl is a fish out of water. The rest of the movie is compiled of Crawl's misadventures to try to impress the family of Rebecca. One scene includes him of stealing one of the families machines and taking it for a joy ride throughout their field with John Denver's Thank God I'm a Country Boy playing in the background. I'm not proud to say it, but that scene was hilarious. There is also a strange, not very well put together love subplot with Rebecca and her boyfriend. There is nothing to even show that Rebecca even loves or cares about her boyfriend. Most of the movie is her blowing him off on various occasions. Also, we are lead to believe that Rebecca is in love with Crawl. Honestly, that isn't too believable because there is nothing about Crawl's appearance or personality that could make him attract a girl like Rebecca. We are constantly told she is a smart and potential-filled girl who wants to be a journalist, but somehow, she falls for someone with no hopes, dreams, other than getting through to the next day. Son in Law doesn't have the humor or chemistry Bio-Dome or Encino Man did, but it's better than Jury Duty and a little better than In the Army Now. The one satisfying aspect of this is you can see Link (Fraser), the caveman from Encino Man (done two years prior to this), in a cameo role. That and the fact this is Shore's "Weasel" personality at full force. That can be a pro or a con. I, for one, had no problem with it. Starring: Pauly Shore, Carla Gugino, Lane Smith, Cindy Pickett, Tiffani Thiessen, Dan Gauthier, Patrick Renna, Dennis Burkley, and Brendan Fraser. Directed by: Steve Rash.

    I can't believe how low of a rating this movie has. I just watched this movie for the first time in years, and if anything... this movie has more great comedy in it than the garbage coming out these days. Pauly Shore is hilarious, Lane Smith does such a hilarious job too, well the entire cast was great. Sure the story line might be a tad bit predictable, but what's funnier than seeing someone like Pauly Shore handle farm life? This is definitely one of the top movies of 1993. Great humour, great cast, great music... it's definitely not like the movies made today where its all about male sluts hooking up with girls constantly or all sexually oriented. This is a true comedy classic. Clearly those who voted so low don't have a sense of humour. 10 out of 10 for sure.

    It amazes me that anyone would not find Pauly Shore entertaining: but then, some people live in a city that supports a pedophile mayor. That person has his little "Oregon" jerk vocabulary and a basic stock of unwashed hippie clothes. Mainly, he is just obnoxious. That said, I watched this movie because I was up and there was literally nothing else on but infomercials, otherwise I would have watched Matlock or Murder She Wrote. Anyway, the film was more than OK because Pauly the Wheez was awesome and didn't just played it as a comic actor instead of, well, Pauly. Anyway, I'm sure Pauly fans will like it anyway - but if you are not a Pauly fan, stay away from this crock of manure. I had to leave this comment after seeing that another user actually gave this film a 3/10! (Maybe it was Pauly!!) Personally, I gave it a 10/10 because this movie is awesome.

    I just saw Sin City for the first time this week and couldn't help but notice how attractive Carla Gugino still is, once I found out she was 39 years old!! After Googling her name, I stumbled upon a video clip picture that for me was instantly recognizable. SHE was the stunning brunette in the Bon Jovi clip for "Always" (1994). For 16 long years, I finally found out it was the gorgeous Miss Gugino (after not knowing all this time) who not only was in that clip, but also featured in a Season 5 episode of "The Wonder Years." More recently, she was also in "Night At The Museum" with Ben Stiller. Going into the video store this afternoon, I decided to get out "Son In Law" which I recall seeing as a teenager and quite enjoyed. After the revelations of the past week I again was surprised to find a young Carla Gugino in the lead role next to Pauly Shore. This is your typical 90s looking movie, just about watchable but nothing spectacular. Pauly Shaw's character "Crawl" is pretty much the same as his character in Encino Man. But like most people who have commented on this movie, they can't help but mention the equally stunning Tiffani-Amber Thiessen from 90s sitcom "Saved By The Bell". Someone mentioned in this thread she should have been in the lead role but the fact remains is Gugino over time has had a more prestigious acting career than Thiessen and her role in "Son In Law" shows this. In saying that, Thiessen is certainly memorable in this movie and easily sits in my Top 20 Hottest Females of All Time list. If anything, its great to see both of these girls in early roles and I don't agree with some people who have regarded this as "one of the worst movies of all time". Sure, Pauly Shore at times is annoying but if you want to see a truly bad movie, go check out Adam Sandler's very first effort "Going Overboard".

    This was such a funny movie, which was soon forgotten about, probably because there are so many teen and young adult comedies, such as this. The movie is not quit as predictable as one would think. Crawl is an unattractive, but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend. Still, an unlikely match for Rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly kind boyfriend back home. When he helps feel more at ease at school, by showing her around the neighborhood and encouraging her to socialize more, they become buddies, but it is completely platonic. When she realizes her boyfriend might propose, she does not feel ready, he seems to like her boyfriend, but she seems to be enjoying her free laid back party life at college is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility. You kind of learn what a good friend Crawl is when he tells her he will help get her out of getting married. When her boyfriend proposes to her, in front of the whole family, she kicks Crawl and puts him on the spot. He tells the whole family that he proposes to her, and gives her his diamond ring, which it tunrs out was his the whole time (he must have come from money or something. Well they never really show a close up of the ring). The message of the movie seemed to be not to judge people by their looks and not to judge people before you get to know him. Rebecca's boyfriend, who her parents love, turned mean when we find out he druged his new girlfriend after Rebecca,(Amber Thesan) and Crawl, so that Rebecca would have broken up with Crawl, thinking they were a couple. Although they were not, Rebecca was mad at him, which when you think about it, was kind of unfair, since they were not a couple, but I think they were starting to like one another. And I think she thought there was more. The movie never showed them actually become a couple, they left it open for the viewers to decide. They never even actually kissed at any point, although there was one part where they almost did. That was one thing most viewers seemed to misunderstand. Many people saw it and said, that he would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or a shock, but they were just friends the whole time, even towards the end. And she did not introduce him as her boyfriend; still they never told her parents they were not engaged. Rebecca almost did. Even if he would never become her boyfriend, they could have still been friends. In the 90s for some reason femanin men were in, and there was this big stereo type that woman liked femanin men (not that there is anything wrong with that), think it came from the fact that women like the kind sensitive type, which Crawl proved to be, through his friendship with Rebecca. but when I saw the movie, I must admit, if I went for looks, I thought I would have gone for the first boyfriend. Still it was a creative movie, that tried to teach a lesson on friendship and judging others.

    "Son in Law" is a fairly entertaining country-boy/city-boy comedy starring the now much-maligned Pauly Shore. It's a basic twist on an old formula: here, young girl from conservative small-town America goes to college, meets druggie super-senior boy, brings him home for Thanksgiving, ends of up deceiving family into thinking they're engaged. Of course, Pauly's character ends up pulling the usual gags as he tries to make himself a farmer. There are plenty of flaws in this film, but it manages to make itself a pleasant and entertaining nonetheless. The fish-out-f-water comedy is driven by stereotypes of country and city life, and the two main characters are never really developed as characters. All we ever learn about Rebecca, the female lead, is that she is a college freshman impressionable enough to transform from conservative to rebel on the strength of a few trips out with her RA. That RA, in Pauly Shore, is never explored in the script very much either, but makes much more of an impression due to Shore's extravagant performance. His dopey, burned-out, uninhibited character is the kind that I might have considered unbelievable if I hadn't actually met people like that in college (likewise, the played-up college scenes at the beginning might have seemed over the top if they hadn't resembled a real college dorm slightly exaggerated). The movie turns on Shore's noisy but mellow Californian character, and most of the comedy comes not from the dime-a-dozen plot but from placing this particular crazy nut in a variety of incongruous situations. Often enough this works and while Shore might not be the greatest actor in history he certainly manages to put on a reasonably effective broad-comic persona. The best characters, actually, are Rebecca's family, which actually show hints of complexity and realism in their violent but understandable reaction to Crawl's intrusion into their lives, and their gruffness turning to friendliness. Don't expect any big surprises of heaps of subtlety from this mainstream comedy, but truth be told I had fun watching it

    Frantic, somewhat mean spirited, infantile humor abounds in this city boy turned wannabe farmer tale. It is not outrageous enough to appeal to the Will Ferrell crowd, and not interesting enough to carry the feature length. The most I can praise "Son In Law" would be to say that for the most part it avoids toilet humor. The main problem is that all of the characters lack warmth, and Pauly Shore is so abrasive that he is a most unlikable hero. There are a few amusing bits involving farm animals, and that's about it. The story, what there is, is so simplistic and predictable, it makes "Jury Duty" seem like "Gone with the Wind". - MERK

    This quote comes to us from Alicia Silverstone's character in "Clueless," a mid-1990's American teeny-bopper update of Jane Austen's "Emma." I saw that film before I saw this one, and I never understood what it meant until I saw this latter. Here, one will find every clich&eacute; under the sun. The idea of a sweet, pretty, innocent small-town farmer girl going to university in Los Angeles (or anywhere else, given the state of modern universities) is indeed ripe for excellent material, but this is definitely not it. Character development is about as deep as a kiddie pool. Oh... and as for the jerk suitor? Frankly, in retrospect, I respect him for having the guts to try to take back his girl from such a twerp, however sinister the means!

This is a true comedy classic. Clearly those who voted so low don't have a sense of humour. 10 out of 10 for sure.

    It amazes me that anyone would not find Pauly Shore entertaining: but then, some people live in a city that supports a pedophile mayor. That person has his little "Oregon" jerk vocabulary and a basic stock of unwashed hippie clothes. Mainly, he is just obnoxious. That said, I watched this movie because I was up and there was literally nothing else on but infomercials, otherwise I would have watched Matlock or Murder She Wrote. Anyway, the film was more than OK because Pauly the Wheez was awesome and didn't just played it as a comic actor instead of, well, Pauly. Anyway, I'm sure Pauly fans will like it anyway - but if you are not a Pauly fan, stay away from this crock of manure. I had to leave this comment after seeing that another user actually gave this film a 3/10! (Maybe it was Pauly!!) Personally, I gave it a 10/10 because this movie is awesome.

    I just saw Sin City for the first time this week and couldn't help but notice how attractive Carla Gugino still is, once I found out she was 39 years old!! After Googling her name, I stumbled upon a video clip picture that for me was instantly recognizable. SHE was the stunning brunette in the Bon Jovi clip for "Always" (1994). For 16 long years, I finally found out it was the gorgeous Miss Gugino (after not knowing all this time) who not only was in that clip, but also featured in a Season 5 episode of "The Wonder Years." More recently, she was also in "Night At The Museum" with Ben Stiller. Going into the video store this afternoon, I decided to get out "Son In Law" which I recall seeing as a teenager and quite enjoyed. After the revelations of the past week I again was surprised to find a young Carla Gugino in the lead role next to Pauly Shore. This is your typical 90s looking movie, just about watchable but nothing spectacular. Pauly Shaw's character "Crawl" is pretty much the same as his character in Encino Man. But like most people who have commented on this movie, they can't help but mention the equally stunning Tiffani-Amber Thiessen from 90s sitcom "Saved By The Bell". Someone mentioned in this thread she should have been in the lead role but the fact remains is Gugino over time has had a more prestigious acting career than Thiessen and her role in "Son In Law" shows this. In saying that, Thiessen is certainly memorable in this movie and easily sits in my Top 20 Hottest Females of All Time list. If anything, its great to see both of these girls in early roles and I don't agree with some people who have regarded this as "one of the worst movies of all time". Sure, Pauly Shore at times is annoying but if you want to see a truly bad movie, go check out Adam Sandler's very first effort "Going Overboard".

    This was such a funny movie, which was soon forgotten about, probably because there are so many teen and young adult comedies, such as this. The movie is not quit as predictable as one would think. Crawl is an unattractive, but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend. Still, an unlikely match for Rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly kind boyfriend back home. When he helps feel more at ease at school, by showing her around the neighborhood and encouraging her to socialize more, they become buddies, but it is completely platonic. When she realizes her boyfriend might propose, she does not feel ready, he seems to like her boyfriend, but she seems to be enjoying her free laid back party life at college is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility. You kind of learn what a good friend Crawl is when he tells her he will help get her out of getting married. When her boyfriend proposes to her, in front of the whole family, she kicks Crawl and puts him on the spot. He tells the whole family that he proposes to her, and gives her his diamond ring, which it tunrs out was his the whole time (he must have come from money or something. Well they never really show a close up of the ring). The message of the movie seemed to be not to judge people by their looks and not to judge people before you get to know him. Rebecca's boyfriend, who her parents love, turned mean when we find out he druged his new girlfriend after Rebecca,(Amber Thesan) and Crawl, so that Rebecca would have broken up with Crawl, thinking they were a couple. Although they were not, Rebecca was mad at him, which when you think about it, was kind of unfair, since they were not a couple, but I think they were starting to like one another. And I think she thought there was more. The movie never showed them actually become a couple, they left it open for the viewers to decide. They never even actually kissed at any point, although there was one part where they almost did. That was one thing most viewers seemed to misunderstand. Many people saw it and said, that he would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or a shock, but they were just friends the whole time, even towards the end. And she did not introduce him as her boyfriend; still they never told her parents they were not engaged. Rebecca almost did. Even if he would never become her boyfriend, they could have still been friends. In the 90s for some reason femanin men were in, and there was this big stereo type that woman liked femanin men (not that there is anything wrong with that), think it came from the fact that women like the kind sensitive type, which Crawl proved to be, through his friendship with Rebecca. but when I saw the movie, I must admit, if I went for looks, I thought I would have gone for the first boyfriend. Still it was a creative movie, that tried to teach a lesson on friendship and judging others.

    "Son in Law" is a fairly entertaining country-boy/city-boy comedy starring the now much-maligned Pauly Shore. It's a basic twist on an old formula: here, young girl from conservative small-town America goes to college, meets druggie super-senior boy, brings him home for Thanksgiving, ends of up deceiving family into thinking they're engaged. Of course, Pauly's character ends up pulling the usual gags as he tries to make himself a farmer. There are plenty of flaws in this film, but it manages to make itself a pleasant and entertaining nonetheless. The fish-out-f-water comedy is driven by stereotypes of country and city life, and the two main characters are never really developed as characters. All we ever learn about Rebecca, the female lead, is that she is a college freshman impressionable enough to transform from conservative to rebel on the strength of a few trips out with her RA. That RA, in Pauly Shore, is never explored in the script very much either, but makes much more of an impression due to Shore's extravagant performance. His dopey, burned-out, uninhibited character is the kind that I might have considered unbelievable if I hadn't actually met people like that in college (likewise, the played-up college scenes at the beginning might have seemed over the top if they hadn't resembled a real college dorm slightly exaggerated). The movie turns on Shore's noisy but mellow Californian character, and most of the comedy comes not from the dime-a-dozen plot but from placing this particular crazy nut in a variety of incongruous situations. Often enough this works and while Shore might not be the greatest actor in history he certainly manages to put on a reasonably effective broad-comic persona. The best characters, actually, are Rebecca's family, which actually show hints of complexity and realism in their violent but understandable reaction to Crawl's intrusion into their lives, and their gruffness turning to friendliness. Don't expect any big surprises of heaps of subtlety from this mainstream comedy, but truth be told I had fun watching it

    Frantic, somewhat mean spirited, infantile humor abounds in this city boy turned wannabe farmer tale. It is not outrageous enough to appeal to the Will Ferrell crowd, and not interesting enough to carry the feature length. The most I can praise "Son In Law" would be to say that for the most part it avoids toilet humor. The main problem is that all of the characters lack warmth, and Pauly Shore is so abrasive that he is a most unlikable hero. There are a few amusing bits involving farm animals, and that's about it. The story, what there is, is so simplistic and predictable, it makes "Jury Duty" seem like "Gone with the Wind". - MERK

    This quote comes to us from Alicia Silverstone's character in "Clueless," a mid-1990's American teeny-bopper update of Jane Austen's "Emma." I saw that film before I saw this one, and I never understood what it meant until I saw this latter. Here, one will find every clich&eacute; under the sun. The idea of a sweet, pretty, innocent small-town farmer girl going to university in Los Angeles (or anywhere else, given the state of modern universities) is indeed ripe for excellent material, but this is definitely not it. Character development is about as deep as a kiddie pool. Oh... and as for the jerk suitor? Frankly, in retrospect, I respect him for having the guts to try to take back his girl from such a twerp, however sinister the means!

    Country-girl, Gugino meets rock 'n' roller, surfer-dude (comedian Pauly Shore) while attending college in California; they fall in love (for reasons that remain a mystery to the audience) and she brings him back to the farm to meet his future in-laws. Shore spends most of the film's running-time making animal noises and pronouncing words in a slightly unconventional manner because the writers couldn't be bothered to come up with any jokes. To top it off, the leading lady is also a bitch who heartlessly dumps her boyfriend for the sake of our "charming" genetic- defect, and while this movie does try to justify this by making him a cheater. The problem is, she doesn't find out until the end, so for all she knew, she could have been breaking the heart of an innocent man. Let me tell help you out here movie; merely making one character an ass doesn't exempt the other from being a bitch. Also, merely exaggerating the length of a word (buuuuuuuudy) isn't funny. Lazy humor at it's, err, laziest.

    This comedy will go down as a classic, just like Caddyshack, Meatball's and, UncleBuck to name a few. The first time I saw this movie I rented it. I thought well this looks like a winner and it was. Today it is hard to find a comedy that will make you laugh just like the one's from the 1970' and 1980's. It came out in 1993 and I can relate to this movie because that was the time I was in college too. It begin's with Becka going off to college, in California. Enven though her father Walter, played by Lane Smith, tries his best to change her mind and go to college in South Dakota. She goes to California where it's kinda a culture shock for her; and she hates it at first wanting to come home home. The RA played by Pauly Shore talks her out of it and she has made her 1st friend and saved herself from a mistake. The movie then gets close to Thanksgiving and the coming home to see her family and face the fact that her boyfriend from home might propose to her. She finds out that Crawl, Pauly Shore, will be staying on campus through the holiday. She kinda feels sorry for him; asks him to come home with her. She feels this is a way to get to know her family and also to get out of saying I do when she doesn't. When arriving home her family R shocked by her and Crawl. She's changed her appearance and feels relieved. The family freaks out by what she's done and at first can't stand Crawl, especially Walter. It takes awhile for the family to accept what she's done and it takes them longer to accept Crawl as a friend and supposedly a family member. When they go to dinner at a party of some kind her boyfriend tries to propose and Crawl gets in the way. He claims that he already asked her to marry him. Both he and Becka play along and as the movie goes along the Walter starts to warm up to Crawl, especially after the square dancing party. The next day Crawl goes fishing with Walter Sr. and Walter Jr., Lane Smith. They start to bond by talking about Walter's relationship with his father. The next thing they are talking when granddad appears to be having a heart attack. They, Crawl and Walter run to his aid. While Walter runs to get his father's pills, Crawl begins to attempt CPR on Walts dad thinking he needed it. When he begins to give him mouth-to mouth they both scare the s**t out of each other,"This was one of the funniest parts of the movie" When Walter asked his what happened, Crawl explains, he was trying to give his dad CPR, because he majored in it for a semester, he knew what he was doing. When they got home Crawl knew they both bonded and realized he needed to tell the truth but how. When Crawl goes th his bachelor party it gets worse. He gets drugged by the farm hand Theo and Becka's boyfriend. The next morning he wakes up in the barn with Beck's school chum. Beck'a finds them both and freaks, and tells her parents what happened. We come to fiend out this was a ploy for Becka's boyfriend to win he back and it eventually fails. The truth comes out in the end with an awesome ending. This movie is a great movie for the whole family. Pauly Shore and Lane Smith, winning pair. I believe this was one of Lane Smith's best movies and he is Hilario's too. Today he is missed but he will never be forgotten. The whole cast was great, but Lane Smith was tops, he kept me laughing to the end. This is a great comedy with a great ending you will not be disappointed :). Kris L. CocKayne :)

    When it comes to Son in Law, it's a mixed bag. Its premise is cute, but its delivery is a little strange. It's a comedy with Pauly Shore, so you're not going to get very clever humor. You're going to get below the belt jokes a lot of the time which is perfectly acceptable. As long as you know what you're getting into, you have no right to complain about the jokes. Now do the jokes work? Most of them do, but most don't come from the lead actor/actress. The most jokes come from the girl's brother played by Patrick Renna, famous from The Sandlot. Such a weird little thing to say that the character in the movie who isn't on the cover or mentioned anywhere on the back is the funniest character in the film. And, at the time, he was only known for his role in The Sandlot and I doubt many kids who took the time to see that film did the same for this one. The film is about a farm girl named Rebecca Warner (Guigino) leaving her South Dakota farm to go to College in California. Her parents, mainly her father (Smith), are skeptical about this College and worry that is may tamper with her original roots. She meets Crawl (Shore) who is the residential adviser of her dorm. Crawl is an off the wall kind of friend, and Rebecca thinks it's brilliant to bring him home to her strict family. In California, Crawl fits right in. In South Dakota, Crawl is a fish out of water. The rest of the movie is compiled of Crawl's misadventures to try to impress the family of Rebecca. One scene includes him of stealing one of the families machines and taking it for a joy ride throughout their field with John Denver's Thank God I'm a Country Boy playing in the background. I'm not proud to say it, but that scene was hilarious. There is also a strange, not very well put together love subplot with Rebecca and her boyfriend. There is nothing to even show that Rebecca even loves or cares about her boyfriend. Most of the movie is her blowing him off on various occasions. Also, we are lead to believe that Rebecca is in love with Crawl. Honestly, that isn't too believable because there is nothing about Crawl's appearance or personality that could make him attract a girl like Rebecca. We are constantly told she is a smart and potential-filled girl who wants to be a journalist, but somehow, she falls for someone with no hopes, dreams, other than getting through to the next day. Son in Law doesn't have the humor or chemistry Bio-Dome or Encino Man did, but it's better than Jury Duty and a little better than In the Army Now. The one satisfying aspect of this is you can see Link (Fraser), the caveman from Encino Man (done two years prior to this), in a cameo role. That and the fact this is Shore's "Weasel" personality at full force. That can be a pro or a con. I, for one, had no problem with it. Starring: Pauly Shore, Carla Gugino, Lane Smith, Cindy Pickett, Tiffani Thiessen, Dan Gauthier, Patrick Renna, Dennis Burkley, and Brendan Fraser. Directed by: Steve Rash.

    I can't believe how low of a rating this movie has. I just watched this movie for the first time in years, and if anything... this movie has more great comedy in it than the garbage coming out these days. Pauly Shore is hilarious, Lane Smith does such a hilarious job too, well the entire cast was great. Sure the story line might be a tad bit predictable, but what's funnier than seeing someone like Pauly Shore handle farm life? This is definitely one of the top movies of 1993. Great humour, great cast, great music... it's definitely not like the movies made today where its all about male sluts hooking up with girls constantly or all sexually oriented.

    Country-girl, Gugino meets rock 'n' roller, surfer-dude (comedian Pauly Shore) while attending college in California; they fall in love (for reasons that remain a mystery to the audience) and she brings him back to the farm to meet his future in-laws. Shore spends most of the film's running-time making animal noises and pronouncing words in a slightly unconventional manner because the writers couldn't be bothered to come up with any jokes. To top it off, the leading lady is also a bitch who heartlessly dumps her boyfriend for the sake of our "charming" genetic- defect, and while this movie does try to justify this by making him a cheater. The problem is, she doesn't find out until the end, so for all she knew, she could have been breaking the heart of an innocent man. Let me tell help you out here movie; merely making one character an ass doesn't exempt the other from being a bitch. Also, merely exaggerating the length of a word (buuuuuuuudy) isn't funny. Lazy humor at it's, err, laziest.

    This comedy will go down as a classic, just like Caddyshack, Meatball's and, UncleBuck to name a few. The first time I saw this movie I rented it. I thought well this looks like a winner and it was. Today it is hard to find a comedy that will make you laugh just like the one's from the 1970' and 1980's. It came out in 1993 and I can relate to this movie because that was the time I was in college too. It begin's with Becka going off to college, in California. Enven though her father Walter, played by Lane Smith, tries his best to change her mind and go to college in South Dakota. She goes to California where it's kinda a culture shock for her; and she hates it at first wanting to come home home. The RA played by Pauly Shore talks her out of it and she has made her 1st friend and saved herself from a mistake. The movie then gets close to Thanksgiving and the coming home to see her family and face the fact that her boyfriend from home might propose to her. She finds out that Crawl, Pauly Shore, will be staying on campus through the holiday. She kinda feels sorry for him; asks him to come home with her. She feels this is a way to get to know her family and also to get out of saying I do when she doesn't. When arriving home her family R shocked by her and Crawl. She's changed her appearance and feels relieved. The family freaks out by what she's done and at first can't stand Crawl, especially Walter. It takes awhile for the family to accept what she's done and it takes them longer to accept Crawl as a friend and supposedly a family member. When they go to dinner at a party of some kind her boyfriend tries to propose and Crawl gets in the way. He claims that he already asked her to marry him. Both he and Becka play along and as the movie goes along the Walter starts to warm up to Crawl, especially after the square dancing party. The next day Crawl goes fishing with Walter Sr. and Walter Jr., Lane Smith. They start to bond by talking about Walter's relationship with his father. The next thing they are talking when granddad appears to be having a heart attack. They, Crawl and Walter run to his aid. While Walter runs to get his father's pills, Crawl begins to attempt CPR on Walts dad thinking he needed it. When he begins to give him mouth-to mouth they both scare the s**t out of each other,"This was one of the funniest parts of the movie" When Walter asked his what happened, Crawl explains, he was trying to give his dad CPR, because he majored in it for a semester, he knew what he was doing. When they got home Crawl knew they both bonded and realized he needed to tell the truth but how. When Crawl goes th his bachelor party it gets worse. He gets drugged by the farm hand Theo and Becka's boyfriend. The next morning he wakes up in the barn with Beck's school chum. Beck'a finds them both and freaks, and tells her parents what happened. We come to fiend out this was a ploy for Becka's boyfriend to win he back and it eventually fails. The truth comes out in the end with an awesome ending. This movie is a great movie for the whole family. Pauly Shore and Lane Smith, winning pair. I believe this was one of Lane Smith's best movies and he is Hilario's too. Today he is missed but he will never be forgotten. The whole cast was great, but Lane Smith was tops, he kept me laughing to the end. This is a great comedy with a great ending you will not be disappointed :). Kris L. CocKayne :)

    When it comes to Son in Law, it's a mixed bag. Its premise is cute, but its delivery is a little strange. It's a comedy with Pauly Shore, so you're not going to get very clever humor. You're going to get below the belt jokes a lot of the time which is perfectly acceptable. As long as you know what you're getting into, you have no right to complain about the jokes. Now do the jokes work? Most of them do, but most don't come from the lead actor/actress. The most jokes come from the girl's brother played by Patrick Renna, famous from The Sandlot. Such a weird little thing to say that the character in the movie who isn't on the cover or mentioned anywhere on the back is the funniest character in the film. And, at the time, he was only known for his role in The Sandlot and I doubt many kids who took the time to see that film did the same for this one. The film is about a farm girl named Rebecca Warner (Guigino) leaving her South Dakota farm to go to College in California. Her parents, mainly her father (Smith), are skeptical about this College and worry that is may tamper with her original roots. She meets Crawl (Shore) who is the residential adviser of her dorm. Crawl is an off the wall kind of friend, and Rebecca thinks it's brilliant to bring him home to her strict family. In California, Crawl fits right in. In South Dakota, Crawl is a fish out of water. The rest of the movie is compiled of Crawl's misadventures to try to impress the family of Rebecca. One scene includes him of stealing one of the families machines and taking it for a joy ride throughout their field with John Denver's Thank God I'm a Country Boy playing in the background. I'm not proud to say it, but that scene was hilarious. There is also a strange, not very well put together love subplot with Rebecca and her boyfriend. There is nothing to even show that Rebecca even loves or cares about her boyfriend. Most of the movie is her blowing him off on various occasions. Also, we are lead to believe that Rebecca is in love with Crawl. Honestly, that isn't too believable because there is nothing about Crawl's appearance or personality that could make him attract a girl like Rebecca. We are constantly told she is a smart and potential-filled girl who wants to be a journalist, but somehow, she falls for someone with no hopes, dreams, other than getting through to the next day. Son in Law doesn't have the humor or chemistry Bio-Dome or Encino Man did, but it's better than Jury Duty and a little better than In the Army Now. The one satisfying aspect of this is you can see Link (Fraser), the caveman from Encino Man (done two years prior to this), in a cameo role. That and the fact this is Shore's "Weasel" personality at full force. That can be a pro or a con. I, for one, had no problem with it. Starring: Pauly Shore, Carla Gugino, Lane Smith, Cindy Pickett, Tiffani Thiessen, Dan Gauthier, Patrick Renna, Dennis Burkley, and Brendan Fraser. Directed by: Steve Rash.

    I can't believe how low of a rating this movie has. I just watched this movie for the first time in years, and if anything... this movie has more great comedy in it than the garbage coming out these days. Pauly Shore is hilarious, Lane Smith does such a hilarious job too, well the entire cast was great. Sure the story line might be a tad bit predictable, but what's funnier than seeing someone like Pauly Shore handle farm life? This is definitely one of the top movies of 1993. Great humour, great cast, great music... it's definitely not like the movies made today where its all about male sluts hooking up with girls constantly or all sexually oriented. This is a true comedy classic. Clearly those who voted so low don't have a sense of humour. 10 out of 10 for sure.

    It amazes me that anyone would not find Pauly Shore entertaining: but then, some people live in a city that supports a pedophile mayor. That person has his little "Oregon" jerk vocabulary and a basic stock of unwashed hippie clothes. Mainly, he is just obnoxious. That said, I watched this movie because I was up and there was literally nothing else on but infomercials, otherwise I would have watched Matlock or Murder She Wrote. Anyway, the film was more than OK because Pauly the Wheez was awesome and didn't just played it as a comic actor instead of, well, Pauly. Anyway, I'm sure Pauly fans will like it anyway - but if you are not a Pauly fan, stay away from this crock of manure. I had to leave this comment after seeing that another user actually gave this film a 3/10! (Maybe it was Pauly!!) Personally, I gave it a 10/10 because this movie is awesome.

    I just saw Sin City for the first time this week and couldn't help but notice how attractive Carla Gugino still is, once I found out she was 39 years old!! After Googling her name, I stumbled upon a video clip picture that for me was instantly recognizable. SHE was the stunning brunette in the Bon Jovi clip for "Always" (1994). For 16 long years, I finally found out it was the gorgeous Miss Gugino (after not knowing all this time) who not only was in that clip, but also featured in a Season 5 episode of "The Wonder Years." More recently, she was also in "Night At The Museum" with Ben Stiller. Going into the video store this afternoon, I decided to get out "Son In Law" which I recall seeing as a teenager and quite enjoyed. After the revelations of the past week I again was surprised to find a young Carla Gugino in the lead role next to Pauly Shore. This is your typical 90s looking movie, just about watchable but nothing spectacular. Pauly Shaw's character "Crawl" is pretty much the same as his character in Encino Man. But like most people who have commented on this movie, they can't help but mention the equally stunning Tiffani-Amber Thiessen from 90s sitcom "Saved By The Bell". Someone mentioned in this thread she should have been in the lead role but the fact remains is Gugino over time has had a more prestigious acting career than Thiessen and her role in "Son In Law" shows this. In saying that, Thiessen is certainly memorable in this movie and easily sits in my Top 20 Hottest Females of All Time list. If anything, its great to see both of these girls in early roles and I don't agree with some people who have regarded this as "one of the worst movies of all time". Sure, Pauly Shore at times is annoying but if you want to see a truly bad movie, go check out Adam Sandler's very first effort "Going Overboard".

    This was such a funny movie, which was soon forgotten about, probably because there are so many teen and young adult comedies, such as this. The movie is not quit as predictable as one would think. Crawl is an unattractive, but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend. Still, an unlikely match for Rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly kind boyfriend back home. When he helps feel more at ease at school, by showing her around the neighborhood and encouraging her to socialize more, they become buddies, but it is completely platonic. When she realizes her boyfriend might propose, she does not feel ready, he seems to like her boyfriend, but she seems to be enjoying her free laid back party life at college is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility. You kind of learn what a good friend Crawl is when he tells her he will help get her out of getting married. When her boyfriend proposes to her, in front of the whole family, she kicks Crawl and puts him on the spot. He tells the whole family that he proposes to her, and gives her his diamond ring, which it tunrs out was his the whole time (he must have come from money or something. Well they never really show a close up of the ring). The message of the movie seemed to be not to judge people by their looks and not to judge people before you get to know him. Rebecca's boyfriend, who her parents love, turned mean when we find out he druged his new girlfriend after Rebecca,(Amber Thesan) and Crawl, so that Rebecca would have broken up with Crawl, thinking they were a couple. Although they were not, Rebecca was mad at him, which when you think about it, was kind of unfair, since they were not a couple, but I think they were starting to like one another. And I think she thought there was more. The movie never showed them actually become a couple, they left it open for the viewers to decide. They never even actually kissed at any point, although there was one part where they almost did. That was one thing most viewers seemed to misunderstand. Many people saw it and said, that he would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or a shock, but they were just friends the whole time, even towards the end. And she did not introduce him as her boyfriend; still they never told her parents they were not engaged. Rebecca almost did. Even if he would never become her boyfriend, they could have still been friends. In the 90s for some reason femanin men were in, and there was this big stereo type that woman liked femanin men (not that there is anything wrong with that), think it came from the fact that women like the kind sensitive type, which Crawl proved to be, through his friendship with Rebecca. but when I saw the movie, I must admit, if I went for looks, I thought I would have gone for the first boyfriend. Still it was a creative movie, that tried to teach a lesson on friendship and judging others.

    "Son in Law" is a fairly entertaining country-boy/city-boy comedy starring the now much-maligned Pauly Shore. It's a basic twist on an old formula: here, young girl from conservative small-town America goes to college, meets druggie super-senior boy, brings him home for Thanksgiving, ends of up deceiving family into thinking they're engaged. Of course, Pauly's character ends up pulling the usual gags as he tries to make himself a farmer. There are plenty of flaws in this film, but it manages to make itself a pleasant and entertaining nonetheless. The fish-out-f-water comedy is driven by stereotypes of country and city life, and the two main characters are never really developed as characters. All we ever learn about Rebecca, the female lead, is that she is a college freshman impressionable enough to transform from conservative to rebel on the strength of a few trips out with her RA. That RA, in Pauly Shore, is never explored in the script very much either, but makes much more of an impression due to Shore's extravagant performance. His dopey, burned-out, uninhibited character is the kind that I might have considered unbelievable if I hadn't actually met people like that in college (likewise, the played-up college scenes at the beginning might have seemed over the top if they hadn't resembled a real college dorm slightly exaggerated). The movie turns on Shore's noisy but mellow Californian character, and most of the comedy comes not from the dime-a-dozen plot but from placing this particular crazy nut in a variety of incongruous situations. Often enough this works and while Shore might not be the greatest actor in history he certainly manages to put on a reasonably effective broad-comic persona. The best characters, actually, are Rebecca's family, which actually show hints of complexity and realism in their violent but understandable reaction to Crawl's intrusion into their lives, and their gruffness turning to friendliness. Don't expect any big surprises of heaps of subtlety from this mainstream comedy, but truth be told I had fun watching it

    Frantic, somewhat mean spirited, infantile humor abounds in this city boy turned wannabe farmer tale. It is not outrageous enough to appeal to the Will Ferrell crowd, and not interesting enough to carry the feature length. The most I can praise "Son In Law" would be to say that for the most part it avoids toilet humor. The main problem is that all of the characters lack warmth, and Pauly Shore is so abrasive that he is a most unlikable hero. There are a few amusing bits involving farm animals, and that's about it. The story, what there is, is so simplistic and predictable, it makes "Jury Duty" seem like "Gone with the Wind". - MERK

    This quote comes to us from Alicia Silverstone's character in "Clueless," a mid-1990's American teeny-bopper update of Jane Austen's "Emma." I saw that film before I saw this one, and I never understood what it meant until I saw this latter. Here, one will find every clich&eacute; under the sun. The idea of a sweet, pretty, innocent small-town farmer girl going to university in Los Angeles (or anywhere else, given the state of modern universities) is indeed ripe for excellent material, but this is definitely not it. Character development is about as deep as a kiddie pool. Oh... and as for the jerk suitor? Frankly, in retrospect, I respect him for having the guts to try to take back his girl from such a twerp, however sinister the means!

After the revelations of the past week I again was surprised to find a young Carla Gugino in the lead role next to Pauly Shore. This is your typical 90s looking movie, just about watchable but nothing spectacular. Pauly Shaw's character "Crawl" is pretty much the same as his character in Encino Man. But like most people who have commented on this movie, they can't help but mention the equally stunning Tiffani-Amber Thiessen from 90s sitcom "Saved By The Bell". Someone mentioned in this thread she should have been in the lead role but the fact remains is Gugino over time has had a more prestigious acting career than Thiessen and her role in "Son In Law" shows this. In saying that, Thiessen is certainly memorable in this movie and easily sits in my Top 20 Hottest Females of All Time list. If anything, its great to see both of these girls in early roles and I don't agree with some people who have regarded this as "one of the worst movies of all time". Sure, Pauly Shore at times is annoying but if you want to see a truly bad movie, go check out Adam Sandler's very first effort "Going Overboard".

    This was such a funny movie, which was soon forgotten about, probably because there are so many teen and young adult comedies, such as this. The movie is not quit as predictable as one would think. Crawl is an unattractive, but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend. Still, an unlikely match for Rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly kind boyfriend back home. When he helps feel more at ease at school, by showing her around the neighborhood and encouraging her to socialize more, they become buddies, but it is completely platonic. When she realizes her boyfriend might propose, she does not feel ready, he seems to like her boyfriend, but she seems to be enjoying her free laid back party life at college is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility. You kind of learn what a good friend Crawl is when he tells her he will help get her out of getting married. When her boyfriend proposes to her, in front of the whole family, she kicks Crawl and puts him on the spot. He tells the whole family that he proposes to her, and gives her his diamond ring, which it tunrs out was his the whole time (he must have come from money or something. Well they never really show a close up of the ring). The message of the movie seemed to be not to judge people by their looks and not to judge people before you get to know him. Rebecca's boyfriend, who her parents love, turned mean when we find out he druged his new girlfriend after Rebecca,(Amber Thesan) and Crawl, so that Rebecca would have broken up with Crawl, thinking they were a couple. Although they were not, Rebecca was mad at him, which when you think about it, was kind of unfair, since they were not a couple, but I think they were starting to like one another. And I think she thought there was more. The movie never showed them actually become a couple, they left it open for the viewers to decide. They never even actually kissed at any point, although there was one part where they almost did. That was one thing most viewers seemed to misunderstand. Many people saw it and said, that he would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or a shock, but they were just friends the whole time, even towards the end. And she did not introduce him as her boyfriend; still they never told her parents they were not engaged. Rebecca almost did. Even if he would never become her boyfriend, they could have still been friends. In the 90s for some reason femanin men were in, and there was this big stereo type that woman liked femanin men (not that there is anything wrong with that), think it came from the fact that women like the kind sensitive type, which Crawl proved to be, through his friendship with Rebecca. but when I saw the movie, I must admit, if I went for looks, I thought I would have gone for the first boyfriend. Still it was a creative movie, that tried to teach a lesson on friendship and judging others.

    "Son in Law" is a fairly entertaining country-boy/city-boy comedy starring the now much-maligned Pauly Shore. It's a basic twist on an old formula: here, young girl from conservative small-town America goes to college, meets druggie super-senior boy, brings him home for Thanksgiving, ends of up deceiving family into thinking they're engaged. Of course, Pauly's character ends up pulling the usual gags as he tries to make himself a farmer. There are plenty of flaws in this film, but it manages to make itself a pleasant and entertaining nonetheless. The fish-out-f-water comedy is driven by stereotypes of country and city life, and the two main characters are never really developed as characters. All we ever learn about Rebecca, the female lead, is that she is a college freshman impressionable enough to transform from conservative to rebel on the strength of a few trips out with her RA. That RA, in Pauly Shore, is never explored in the script very much either, but makes much more of an impression due to Shore's extravagant performance. His dopey, burned-out, uninhibited character is the kind that I might have considered unbelievable if I hadn't actually met people like that in college (likewise, the played-up college scenes at the beginning might have seemed over the top if they hadn't resembled a real college dorm slightly exaggerated). The movie turns on Shore's noisy but mellow Californian character, and most of the comedy comes not from the dime-a-dozen plot but from placing this particular crazy nut in a variety of incongruous situations. Often enough this works and while Shore might not be the greatest actor in history he certainly manages to put on a reasonably effective broad-comic persona. The best characters, actually, are Rebecca's family, which actually show hints of complexity and realism in their violent but understandable reaction to Crawl's intrusion into their lives, and their gruffness turning to friendliness. Don't expect any big surprises of heaps of subtlety from this mainstream comedy, but truth be told I had fun watching it

    Frantic, somewhat mean spirited, infantile humor abounds in this city boy turned wannabe farmer tale. It is not outrageous enough to appeal to the Will Ferrell crowd, and not interesting enough to carry the feature length. The most I can praise "Son In Law" would be to say that for the most part it avoids toilet humor. The main problem is that all of the characters lack warmth, and Pauly Shore is so abrasive that he is a most unlikable hero. There are a few amusing bits involving farm animals, and that's about it. The story, what there is, is so simplistic and predictable, it makes "Jury Duty" seem like "Gone with the Wind". - MERK

    This quote comes to us from Alicia Silverstone's character in "Clueless," a mid-1990's American teeny-bopper update of Jane Austen's "Emma." I saw that film before I saw this one, and I never understood what it meant until I saw this latter. Here, one will find every clich&eacute; under the sun. The idea of a sweet, pretty, innocent small-town farmer girl going to university in Los Angeles (or anywhere else, given the state of modern universities) is indeed ripe for excellent material, but this is definitely not it. Character development is about as deep as a kiddie pool. Oh... and as for the jerk suitor? Frankly, in retrospect, I respect him for having the guts to try to take back his girl from such a twerp, however sinister the means!
