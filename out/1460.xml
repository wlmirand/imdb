    This is a great movie by a great director who (when his heirs release the records) will go down in history as the worlds most prolific philanthropist. How he turned a career in house-painting into a life of the arts is one of the many mysteries of the man. The movie reminds me of living life after the driving age but before the (dangerously late) American drinking age. When this movie comes out on DVD you should get a copy for yourself and one for your post adolescent. One of the main characters dies so it can function as nostalgia for you and scared-straight for your offspring. SPOILER ALERT one sentence back. Any way. This is a fine movie and should definitely be of interest to anyone who was a teenager in the suburbs. If that suburb was Westport, then god help you. But seriously, if it was Westport let me know if there is still a pot plant growing in the front window of the Haagen Dazs. Their Coffee shakes are perfect for a post buzz refresher.

    This film, as "truthful" as it was, delved far too heavily in teenage-movie clich&eacute;s. For example, the token black character, who has no true significance in the plot. Also seen were the first kiss, the blooming little sister, the cocky boyfriend, and the group disapproval of the cocky boyfriend, and the narrow escape. I was the same age as the characters in this film when it came out, and, I'm sorry, but I thought they were just a smidge overdramatic at times, and at other times, boring. Truthfully, I didn't care about the car accident. I had no reason to feel attached to any characters, least of all the one who died.

    A realistic view of teenage life in suburban Connecticut. Hanging out in the middle of nowhere, getting bothered by cops, driving fast, and getting in trouble are all parts of this movie as they are a part of life. The excellent soundtrack helps make this movie seem much more expensive that it was.
