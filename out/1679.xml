    ... this is one of my favourite films. I just can't help loving it. It's certainly not a great film, it doesn't aim for the artistic highground. By most measures, this is a 6.5 at best. The script's loose in places, as is the acting on occasions and the whole thing feels as if it needed just one more take. But the characters make it special. Asia Argento, Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys Myers are perfectly cast and really inhabit their roles. Their characters and the relationships between them give real depth and believability to a hackneyed story. If you approach this expecting a quirky and very charming film, you're in for a treat. If you've been fooled by the artwork on the cover and expect a thriller, replete with car chases and gunplay, you may be disappointed.

    The posters and DVD arts project this to be a sexy crime thriller about a female bank or jewel robber or something. Instead, it's a romantic drama with a touch of crime thriller here and there but nothing like what you'd have expected. I don't mind the film for what it is. Beatrice (Bee-Ah-Trich-E) is a lovely Italian woman who has gone the straight after a career as an armed robber. She still keeps in touch with a few of her old friends from that life, but mainly, she has gone straight. I wasn't sure if this film was going anywhere interesting, then it turned into a romantic drama when Beatrice meets a guy named Alan (Jared Harris) who works at a classical radio station by night and teaches young kids in school by day. If you want to appreciate the European art/sex film elements of this film, such as full frontal nudity and wild sex scenes, then it will entertain you in that way for a while, as Beatrice and her new lover struggle with his impotence, bad oysters and getting to know each other. When a friend of B's, played by the luscious Jonathan Rhys-Meyers comes into the scene, suddenly there's an actual 2 way plot going somewhere, but this is not until at least 1/3 or 2/3 into the movie. A very troubled (downright psychotic) kid at Alan's school stabs another child with a pencil, the whole thing turns ugly and suddenly Alan is faced with losing his teaching job. At the same time, B's friend needs her to come out of retirement to help him get some debts cleared up. Asia Argento is a fun actress to watch, even if she's not the greatest actress ever. Still, this film seems to not be able to make up its mind what it wanted to be. It's entertaining in some ways, but not exciting enough for me to recommend.

    As some others have said, this film is carried in large measure by its central players. While some plot dynamics are typical of the genre, I disagree with the claims some have made that the plot itself is weak. There are, in fact, some plot elements that constitute unique dramatic formulations, at least relative to English-language films. There are numerous social and cultural themes that are woven into the storyline. Substance abuse and other modes of addiction are incorporated. Domestic violence, too, comes into play. The film itself does not offer much in the way of commentary on these sociocultural facets, and the portrayal of broader social themes appears primarily to serve as a vehicle for character development. The soundtrack is excellent and incorporates quality jazz instrumental tracks as well as contributions from the critically acclaimed band Portishead. The presence of jazz on the soundtrack is paralleled by its presence in the story, so much so in fact that jazz itself takes on thematic and symbolic values. The cinematography is of a high quality, and is characterized by rich, vibrant images. The selection of images and their composition serve several purposes, one of which is to orient the viewer to shifts within the direction of the story. Such mechanisms enjoy considerable subtlety and their use strikes me as neither pretentious nor overly ambitious. Asia Argento deserves special mention, and not just because she is easily one of today's most attractive actresses. Although she is not the only exceptional actor in this cast, it is Argento that really makes the film.

    Asia Argento is a cinema goddess that plays a thief active in London's underbelly. She's caught up in strange love triangle between her male crime partner and his straight laced lover. Each wanting the other. When the two gay lovers split Asia slowly corrupts the straight laced character. The acting by every one is robust and intense. Asia Argento once again proves in B. Monkey why she should be considered a great actor. I love her European attitude view of nudity. She has no problem taking her clothes off showing her body. That line in a John Mayer song about a wonderland had to be made in honor of Asia Argento. B. Monkey is a story that touches on what it's like to live on the edge of society. I was engrossed in this cinematic masterpiece from minute one.

    "Nineteen Eighty Four" director Michael Radford's minor romantic crime thriller "B. Monkey" chronicles the stormy relationship between an impulsive female cat burglar and a conventional male school teacher. Dario Argento's super sexy daughter Asia plays the eponymous character with relish in this beautifully photographed, well-acted, but ultimately forgettable epic. Indeed, you'll have trouble keeping your eyes off the lovely Asia who shows no qualms about showing off her delectable body in tastefully lensed full frontal nudity. An assortment of criminals floats into and out of her life as she struggles like an old western gunfighter to cease her life of crime. Beatrice explains in voice over narration how she came to acquire her name: "I can get into anything." One day in a pub, a lonely English teacher at a primary school, Alan (Jared Harris) approaches Beatrice. Initially, she rebuffs him because she neither knows nor trusts him. Finally, Alan convinces Beatrice that he poses no threat to her so she agrees to a date the following evening at eight and stands him up. Beatrice's low-life friendsthey might be more accurately described as accomplices--include homosexual Paul (Rupert Everett of "Cemetery Man") cut from the same cloth as Noel Coward and a lunatic young hoodlum boyfriend, Bruno (Jonathan Rhys Meyers of "Ride With The Devil"), who is prepared to die for her. Meanwhile, ordinary Alan teaches by day and serves as a disc jockey by night at a local London hospital. Eventually, Beatrice and Alan get together, but Beatrice discovers that the young school teacher cannot get it up. Whether Alan cannot gain an erection in the warm company of the comely Asia--who resembles a brunette Venus on a half-shellor because he is too overwhelmed by her abrupt behavior is never established. Eventually, Asia gets him back into shape and the two fall in love. Anyway, Beatrice refuses to work for a local mobster, Frank (Tim Woodward), but complications arise that force her back into crime. Alan has trouble with a student who accuses him of slamming him against a wall after the student stabbed another student in the face with a pencil. The boy's surly mother prefers charges against Alan, but Beatrice and Bruno pay her a visit and change her mind. Naturally, Alan is outraged and manages to get another teaching job far out in the country. Beatrice leaves London and her friends, but she cannot truly leave them and the consequences of her criminal activities come back to haunt her in the wilderness. The performances are tops and director Michael Radford keeps things moving along so the action never stalls out. The chief problem is that none of the characters are interesting. They are either goody-two shoes like Alan or obnoxious criminal types like Bruno. Radford stages a couple of credible jewelry heists, largely smash and grab affairs, and gives his average, unexceptional film more polish than it deserves. Those who must have happy endings will love "B. Monkey." This movie breaks the clich&eacute; about the ready-to-have sex mentality of men. When Beatrice knows that she is about to have sex with a guy, she jumps in bed and peels her clothes off quicker than the man can get his pants down. Typically, the man is the ready-to-have sex partner with the woman showing some reluctance. Again, aside from Asia's gorgeous body and some good acting, "B. Monkey" is like a banana peel. You watch this movie and you will feel like you've make a slip-up.

    It isn't quite a genre, but there sure is a tightly related collection of films that rely on an actress to charm us. The form is simple: find a woman with intrinsic energy, and shape a story to pull that out. We fall in love just like the usually helpless guy in the story. Events surround and threaten, all designed to highlight the specific charms of the focus and show that we (through our representative) will stick with the girl. Its a simple narrative fold, a trick to engage us in the story. The story is the girl, and the tighter we follow her, the more we are drawn into the story. The problem of course is that its all designed to pull us in, with nothing of value happening while we are in. The usual solution is to acknowledge that and make a point of the future being empty, deliberately so. So Deckard goes of with Rachel into a void. Its about the staying, the belonging. There are only three real values in this. Does the girl charm? Is the story and the charming integrated? What's the world they send us into at the end? This girl is the daughter of a filmmaker who specializes in doing violence to such characters, layering heavy noir dynamics on them. So there's that. She's particularly seductive in an aggressive way, not at all say, like Dalle in Betty Blue, where we the viewer are complicit in the seduction. Dalle matters. We carry her away after the film. Our girl here is nude a few times as if that matters a lot. The hapless guy is a radio storyteller, teacher, musician, champion of social justice as if we needed more than one anchor. She's also a wonderful thief, as if we needed some "Ms 45" seduction, that sort of ping when the sex is with someone who has killed. So its all overloaded. The last 20 minutes is close to lovely. Its been done before, this business of painting a derelict room in the wild. (I recently saw it to good effect in Stromboli.) Our girl turns lovely in the country. But its the sideshow with two gay friends that makes this worth watching. These guys are played by Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. If you study narrative, you'll appreciate how this backstory supports the whole. Its quite lovely because she is most sexual, nude and loved when in the company of these men. It gives her an excuse to show us that she is inherently seduction, not deliberately so. It provides a footing for love that is outside of sex, and though based on obsession and addiction transcends them by using them. Everett really seems to understand this. Its his best performance by far. You almost fall in love with him instead of her by misdirection, because that's where the passion is. So it works, sex without sex, love by capture. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.

    A very lousy cast (Meyers, Argento, Harris, Everett) are very miscast in a mostly crappy and very pointless film. But none is more miscast than Asia, though. Argento plays one of those dangerous criminal goyls that only exist in the minds of movie-writers: she's rough and tough -IF you'll believe it. To make her (even) tougher they made her say "f***" about a hundred times, yet every time she said the word it was as funny and fresh as the first time. Fortunately, she takes her clothes off nearly as often as she says "f***", and she does look good in the nude. Harris is his usual ugly, uncharismatic, untalented self, so the fact that he's miscast is a mere irrelevancy; although the fact that he plays an impotent man does have a ring of truth about it. This nepotistic thespian shouldn't B. in movies, period. Everett lacks credibility and overplays his "cool cat" routine too often. The movie is absurd, has some rather "duh" dialog, and the only things going for it are its nice visual quality, the fact that it isn't too boring, and, of course Asia's nudity. With a cast like this, it would have been naive to expect a better movie. If you want a complete listing of Hollywood's nepotist actors and actresses, with pictures and explanations, e-mail me.

    I am not a lover of gangster movies , am very squeamish so I avoided this for a long time. I wanted to watch Rupert Everett's films after reading his extraordinary auto-bio. There are some excellent reviews here already , far better than anything I could write. I have never seen Jared Harris in anything but he is perfect in this roll. He even tries to talk down psychopaths with primary teacher talk. The pencil in cheek scene was particularly amazing for me as it happened to my daughter so she was home-educated as a result. The chaos of an inner-city school is perfectly portrayed. There probably is too much sex but I wasn't bothered it probably brought in a few viewers and frankly having breasts myself they don't bother me. Rupert Everett was excellent as the louche drug addict who seemed to be giving up on life bit by bit. Towards the end he is frightened but is too far gone to really know how to help himself. The channel had a discussion on addiction on before which made it rather more poignant. The cold killer gangsters were good , Bruno was chilling because as a Mum I wonder how easy it is to become a rent boy/gangster desperately seeking love . I am not so sure Monkey/Beatrice will stay a happy housewife but that's another story.

    This is a film that I've seen a while ago and I find it quite memorable. Starring Asia Argento and Jared Harris in lead roles and Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in supporting roles, it is an unusual cross between a thriller and a melodrama, with equal amounts of love scenes, violence and suspense. This was my introduction to both Argento and Harris and they both pleased me with their performances, especially the lovely Asia who looks so sultry and seductive here. Also Everett and Rhys-Meyers make this film more interesting with their love/hate relationship that ultimately ends with blood. Everett is at his most seductive here as well and he even gets a brief "love scene" with Asia. "B. Monkey" is a quite enjoyable film and the storyline is pretty well-crafted, keeping the suspense until the very end. In contrast to many other such "sex thrillers", this film also works well as a drama, especially from the angle of the male protagonist. Harris' character is not a traditional hero, but an impotent teacher who is trying to help a violent child. This part shows how noble and caring men are often getting trampled at by loathsome persons, in this case the child's abusive and utterly despicable mother. This makes "B. Monkey" a mixed bag that aims to please fans of both drama and thrillers.

    Beatrice(Asia Argento) is a thief who comes into the life of teacher/DJ Alan(Jared Harris), bringing a little excitement and a little trouble. It's a plot that has been done better before and B. Monkey doesn't bring anything new to the genre. The cast, which also includes John Rhys Meyers ans Rupert Everett as B. partners in crime, make it worth watching. Jared Harris looks like that teacher with the hot wife that nobody quite knows why she is with him, John Rhys Meyers is perhaps Asia's male partner in pretty, and Rupert Everett is Rupert Everett as always. Most of the attention goes to Asia Argento as she plays another tortured character. The best thing on display in this movie is her body, in the tub, on the bed, and with a gun thrust in front of her bare breasts. That is a good reason to love you.

She's also a wonderful thief, as if we needed some "Ms 45" seduction, that sort of ping when the sex is with someone who has killed. So its all overloaded. The last 20 minutes is close to lovely. Its been done before, this business of painting a derelict room in the wild. (I recently saw it to good effect in Stromboli.) Our girl turns lovely in the country. But its the sideshow with two gay friends that makes this worth watching. These guys are played by Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. If you study narrative, you'll appreciate how this backstory supports the whole. Its quite lovely because she is most sexual, nude and loved when in the company of these men. It gives her an excuse to show us that she is inherently seduction, not deliberately so. It provides a footing for love that is outside of sex, and though based on obsession and addiction transcends them by using them. Everett really seems to understand this. Its his best performance by far. You almost fall in love with him instead of her by misdirection, because that's where the passion is. So it works, sex without sex, love by capture. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.

    A very lousy cast (Meyers, Argento, Harris, Everett) are very miscast in a mostly crappy and very pointless film. But none is more miscast than Asia, though. Argento plays one of those dangerous criminal goyls that only exist in the minds of movie-writers: she's rough and tough -IF you'll believe it. To make her (even) tougher they made her say "f***" about a hundred times, yet every time she said the word it was as funny and fresh as the first time. Fortunately, she takes her clothes off nearly as often as she says "f***", and she does look good in the nude. Harris is his usual ugly, uncharismatic, untalented self, so the fact that he's miscast is a mere irrelevancy; although the fact that he plays an impotent man does have a ring of truth about it. This nepotistic thespian shouldn't B. in movies, period. Everett lacks credibility and overplays his "cool cat" routine too often. The movie is absurd, has some rather "duh" dialog, and the only things going for it are its nice visual quality, the fact that it isn't too boring, and, of course Asia's nudity. With a cast like this, it would have been naive to expect a better movie. If you want a complete listing of Hollywood's nepotist actors and actresses, with pictures and explanations, e-mail me.

    I am not a lover of gangster movies , am very squeamish so I avoided this for a long time. I wanted to watch Rupert Everett's films after reading his extraordinary auto-bio. There are some excellent reviews here already , far better than anything I could write. I have never seen Jared Harris in anything but he is perfect in this roll. He even tries to talk down psychopaths with primary teacher talk. The pencil in cheek scene was particularly amazing for me as it happened to my daughter so she was home-educated as a result. The chaos of an inner-city school is perfectly portrayed. There probably is too much sex but I wasn't bothered it probably brought in a few viewers and frankly having breasts myself they don't bother me. Rupert Everett was excellent as the louche drug addict who seemed to be giving up on life bit by bit. Towards the end he is frightened but is too far gone to really know how to help himself. The channel had a discussion on addiction on before which made it rather more poignant. The cold killer gangsters were good , Bruno was chilling because as a Mum I wonder how easy it is to become a rent boy/gangster desperately seeking love . I am not so sure Monkey/Beatrice will stay a happy housewife but that's another story.

    This is a film that I've seen a while ago and I find it quite memorable. Starring Asia Argento and Jared Harris in lead roles and Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in supporting roles, it is an unusual cross between a thriller and a melodrama, with equal amounts of love scenes, violence and suspense. This was my introduction to both Argento and Harris and they both pleased me with their performances, especially the lovely Asia who looks so sultry and seductive here. Also Everett and Rhys-Meyers make this film more interesting with their love/hate relationship that ultimately ends with blood. Everett is at his most seductive here as well and he even gets a brief "love scene" with Asia. "B. Monkey" is a quite enjoyable film and the storyline is pretty well-crafted, keeping the suspense until the very end. In contrast to many other such "sex thrillers", this film also works well as a drama, especially from the angle of the male protagonist. Harris' character is not a traditional hero, but an impotent teacher who is trying to help a violent child. This part shows how noble and caring men are often getting trampled at by loathsome persons, in this case the child's abusive and utterly despicable mother. This makes "B. Monkey" a mixed bag that aims to please fans of both drama and thrillers.

    Beatrice(Asia Argento) is a thief who comes into the life of teacher/DJ Alan(Jared Harris), bringing a little excitement and a little trouble. It's a plot that has been done better before and B. Monkey doesn't bring anything new to the genre. The cast, which also includes John Rhys Meyers ans Rupert Everett as B. partners in crime, make it worth watching. Jared Harris looks like that teacher with the hot wife that nobody quite knows why she is with him, John Rhys Meyers is perhaps Asia's male partner in pretty, and Rupert Everett is Rupert Everett as always. Most of the attention goes to Asia Argento as she plays another tortured character. The best thing on display in this movie is her body, in the tub, on the bed, and with a gun thrust in front of her bare breasts. That is a good reason to love you.

    ... this is one of my favourite films. I just can't help loving it. It's certainly not a great film, it doesn't aim for the artistic highground. By most measures, this is a 6.5 at best. The script's loose in places, as is the acting on occasions and the whole thing feels as if it needed just one more take. But the characters make it special. Asia Argento, Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys Myers are perfectly cast and really inhabit their roles. Their characters and the relationships between them give real depth and believability to a hackneyed story. If you approach this expecting a quirky and very charming film, you're in for a treat. If you've been fooled by the artwork on the cover and expect a thriller, replete with car chases and gunplay, you may be disappointed.

    The posters and DVD arts project this to be a sexy crime thriller about a female bank or jewel robber or something. Instead, it's a romantic drama with a touch of crime thriller here and there but nothing like what you'd have expected. I don't mind the film for what it is. Beatrice (Bee-Ah-Trich-E) is a lovely Italian woman who has gone the straight after a career as an armed robber. She still keeps in touch with a few of her old friends from that life, but mainly, she has gone straight. I wasn't sure if this film was going anywhere interesting, then it turned into a romantic drama when Beatrice meets a guy named Alan (Jared Harris) who works at a classical radio station by night and teaches young kids in school by day. If you want to appreciate the European art/sex film elements of this film, such as full frontal nudity and wild sex scenes, then it will entertain you in that way for a while, as Beatrice and her new lover struggle with his impotence, bad oysters and getting to know each other. When a friend of B's, played by the luscious Jonathan Rhys-Meyers comes into the scene, suddenly there's an actual 2 way plot going somewhere, but this is not until at least 1/3 or 2/3 into the movie. A very troubled (downright psychotic) kid at Alan's school stabs another child with a pencil, the whole thing turns ugly and suddenly Alan is faced with losing his teaching job. At the same time, B's friend needs her to come out of retirement to help him get some debts cleared up. Asia Argento is a fun actress to watch, even if she's not the greatest actress ever. Still, this film seems to not be able to make up its mind what it wanted to be. It's entertaining in some ways, but not exciting enough for me to recommend.

    As some others have said, this film is carried in large measure by its central players. While some plot dynamics are typical of the genre, I disagree with the claims some have made that the plot itself is weak. There are, in fact, some plot elements that constitute unique dramatic formulations, at least relative to English-language films. There are numerous social and cultural themes that are woven into the storyline. Substance abuse and other modes of addiction are incorporated. Domestic violence, too, comes into play. The film itself does not offer much in the way of commentary on these sociocultural facets, and the portrayal of broader social themes appears primarily to serve as a vehicle for character development. The soundtrack is excellent and incorporates quality jazz instrumental tracks as well as contributions from the critically acclaimed band Portishead. The presence of jazz on the soundtrack is paralleled by its presence in the story, so much so in fact that jazz itself takes on thematic and symbolic values. The cinematography is of a high quality, and is characterized by rich, vibrant images. The selection of images and their composition serve several purposes, one of which is to orient the viewer to shifts within the direction of the story. Such mechanisms enjoy considerable subtlety and their use strikes me as neither pretentious nor overly ambitious. Asia Argento deserves special mention, and not just because she is easily one of today's most attractive actresses. Although she is not the only exceptional actor in this cast, it is Argento that really makes the film.

    Asia Argento is a cinema goddess that plays a thief active in London's underbelly. She's caught up in strange love triangle between her male crime partner and his straight laced lover. Each wanting the other. When the two gay lovers split Asia slowly corrupts the straight laced character. The acting by every one is robust and intense. Asia Argento once again proves in B. Monkey why she should be considered a great actor. I love her European attitude view of nudity. She has no problem taking her clothes off showing her body. That line in a John Mayer song about a wonderland had to be made in honor of Asia Argento. B. Monkey is a story that touches on what it's like to live on the edge of society. I was engrossed in this cinematic masterpiece from minute one.

    "Nineteen Eighty Four" director Michael Radford's minor romantic crime thriller "B. Monkey" chronicles the stormy relationship between an impulsive female cat burglar and a conventional male school teacher. Dario Argento's super sexy daughter Asia plays the eponymous character with relish in this beautifully photographed, well-acted, but ultimately forgettable epic. Indeed, you'll have trouble keeping your eyes off the lovely Asia who shows no qualms about showing off her delectable body in tastefully lensed full frontal nudity. An assortment of criminals floats into and out of her life as she struggles like an old western gunfighter to cease her life of crime. Beatrice explains in voice over narration how she came to acquire her name: "I can get into anything." One day in a pub, a lonely English teacher at a primary school, Alan (Jared Harris) approaches Beatrice. Initially, she rebuffs him because she neither knows nor trusts him. Finally, Alan convinces Beatrice that he poses no threat to her so she agrees to a date the following evening at eight and stands him up. Beatrice's low-life friendsthey might be more accurately described as accomplices--include homosexual Paul (Rupert Everett of "Cemetery Man") cut from the same cloth as Noel Coward and a lunatic young hoodlum boyfriend, Bruno (Jonathan Rhys Meyers of "Ride With The Devil"), who is prepared to die for her. Meanwhile, ordinary Alan teaches by day and serves as a disc jockey by night at a local London hospital. Eventually, Beatrice and Alan get together, but Beatrice discovers that the young school teacher cannot get it up. Whether Alan cannot gain an erection in the warm company of the comely Asia--who resembles a brunette Venus on a half-shellor because he is too overwhelmed by her abrupt behavior is never established. Eventually, Asia gets him back into shape and the two fall in love. Anyway, Beatrice refuses to work for a local mobster, Frank (Tim Woodward), but complications arise that force her back into crime. Alan has trouble with a student who accuses him of slamming him against a wall after the student stabbed another student in the face with a pencil. The boy's surly mother prefers charges against Alan, but Beatrice and Bruno pay her a visit and change her mind. Naturally, Alan is outraged and manages to get another teaching job far out in the country. Beatrice leaves London and her friends, but she cannot truly leave them and the consequences of her criminal activities come back to haunt her in the wilderness. The performances are tops and director Michael Radford keeps things moving along so the action never stalls out. The chief problem is that none of the characters are interesting. They are either goody-two shoes like Alan or obnoxious criminal types like Bruno. Radford stages a couple of credible jewelry heists, largely smash and grab affairs, and gives his average, unexceptional film more polish than it deserves. Those who must have happy endings will love "B. Monkey." This movie breaks the clich&eacute; about the ready-to-have sex mentality of men. When Beatrice knows that she is about to have sex with a guy, she jumps in bed and peels her clothes off quicker than the man can get his pants down. Typically, the man is the ready-to-have sex partner with the woman showing some reluctance. Again, aside from Asia's gorgeous body and some good acting, "B. Monkey" is like a banana peel. You watch this movie and you will feel like you've make a slip-up.

    It isn't quite a genre, but there sure is a tightly related collection of films that rely on an actress to charm us. The form is simple: find a woman with intrinsic energy, and shape a story to pull that out. We fall in love just like the usually helpless guy in the story. Events surround and threaten, all designed to highlight the specific charms of the focus and show that we (through our representative) will stick with the girl. Its a simple narrative fold, a trick to engage us in the story. The story is the girl, and the tighter we follow her, the more we are drawn into the story. The problem of course is that its all designed to pull us in, with nothing of value happening while we are in. The usual solution is to acknowledge that and make a point of the future being empty, deliberately so. So Deckard goes of with Rachel into a void. Its about the staying, the belonging. There are only three real values in this. Does the girl charm? Is the story and the charming integrated? What's the world they send us into at the end? This girl is the daughter of a filmmaker who specializes in doing violence to such characters, layering heavy noir dynamics on them. So there's that. She's particularly seductive in an aggressive way, not at all say, like Dalle in Betty Blue, where we the viewer are complicit in the seduction. Dalle matters. We carry her away after the film. Our girl here is nude a few times as if that matters a lot. The hapless guy is a radio storyteller, teacher, musician, champion of social justice as if we needed more than one anchor. She's also a wonderful thief, as if we needed some "Ms 45" seduction, that sort of ping when the sex is with someone who has killed. So its all overloaded. The last 20 minutes is close to lovely. Its been done before, this business of painting a derelict room in the wild. (I recently saw it to good effect in Stromboli.) Our girl turns lovely in the country.

    "Nineteen Eighty Four" director Michael Radford's minor romantic crime thriller "B. Monkey" chronicles the stormy relationship between an impulsive female cat burglar and a conventional male school teacher. Dario Argento's super sexy daughter Asia plays the eponymous character with relish in this beautifully photographed, well-acted, but ultimately forgettable epic. Indeed, you'll have trouble keeping your eyes off the lovely Asia who shows no qualms about showing off her delectable body in tastefully lensed full frontal nudity. An assortment of criminals floats into and out of her life as she struggles like an old western gunfighter to cease her life of crime. Beatrice explains in voice over narration how she came to acquire her name: "I can get into anything." One day in a pub, a lonely English teacher at a primary school, Alan (Jared Harris) approaches Beatrice. Initially, she rebuffs him because she neither knows nor trusts him. Finally, Alan convinces Beatrice that he poses no threat to her so she agrees to a date the following evening at eight and stands him up. Beatrice's low-life friendsthey might be more accurately described as accomplices--include homosexual Paul (Rupert Everett of "Cemetery Man") cut from the same cloth as Noel Coward and a lunatic young hoodlum boyfriend, Bruno (Jonathan Rhys Meyers of "Ride With The Devil"), who is prepared to die for her. Meanwhile, ordinary Alan teaches by day and serves as a disc jockey by night at a local London hospital. Eventually, Beatrice and Alan get together, but Beatrice discovers that the young school teacher cannot get it up. Whether Alan cannot gain an erection in the warm company of the comely Asia--who resembles a brunette Venus on a half-shellor because he is too overwhelmed by her abrupt behavior is never established. Eventually, Asia gets him back into shape and the two fall in love. Anyway, Beatrice refuses to work for a local mobster, Frank (Tim Woodward), but complications arise that force her back into crime. Alan has trouble with a student who accuses him of slamming him against a wall after the student stabbed another student in the face with a pencil. The boy's surly mother prefers charges against Alan, but Beatrice and Bruno pay her a visit and change her mind. Naturally, Alan is outraged and manages to get another teaching job far out in the country. Beatrice leaves London and her friends, but she cannot truly leave them and the consequences of her criminal activities come back to haunt her in the wilderness. The performances are tops and director Michael Radford keeps things moving along so the action never stalls out. The chief problem is that none of the characters are interesting. They are either goody-two shoes like Alan or obnoxious criminal types like Bruno. Radford stages a couple of credible jewelry heists, largely smash and grab affairs, and gives his average, unexceptional film more polish than it deserves. Those who must have happy endings will love "B. Monkey." This movie breaks the clich&eacute; about the ready-to-have sex mentality of men. When Beatrice knows that she is about to have sex with a guy, she jumps in bed and peels her clothes off quicker than the man can get his pants down. Typically, the man is the ready-to-have sex partner with the woman showing some reluctance. Again, aside from Asia's gorgeous body and some good acting, "B. Monkey" is like a banana peel. You watch this movie and you will feel like you've make a slip-up.

    It isn't quite a genre, but there sure is a tightly related collection of films that rely on an actress to charm us. The form is simple: find a woman with intrinsic energy, and shape a story to pull that out. We fall in love just like the usually helpless guy in the story. Events surround and threaten, all designed to highlight the specific charms of the focus and show that we (through our representative) will stick with the girl. Its a simple narrative fold, a trick to engage us in the story. The story is the girl, and the tighter we follow her, the more we are drawn into the story. The problem of course is that its all designed to pull us in, with nothing of value happening while we are in. The usual solution is to acknowledge that and make a point of the future being empty, deliberately so. So Deckard goes of with Rachel into a void. Its about the staying, the belonging. There are only three real values in this. Does the girl charm? Is the story and the charming integrated? What's the world they send us into at the end? This girl is the daughter of a filmmaker who specializes in doing violence to such characters, layering heavy noir dynamics on them. So there's that. She's particularly seductive in an aggressive way, not at all say, like Dalle in Betty Blue, where we the viewer are complicit in the seduction. Dalle matters. We carry her away after the film. Our girl here is nude a few times as if that matters a lot. The hapless guy is a radio storyteller, teacher, musician, champion of social justice as if we needed more than one anchor. She's also a wonderful thief, as if we needed some "Ms 45" seduction, that sort of ping when the sex is with someone who has killed. So its all overloaded. The last 20 minutes is close to lovely. Its been done before, this business of painting a derelict room in the wild. (I recently saw it to good effect in Stromboli.) Our girl turns lovely in the country. But its the sideshow with two gay friends that makes this worth watching. These guys are played by Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. If you study narrative, you'll appreciate how this backstory supports the whole. Its quite lovely because she is most sexual, nude and loved when in the company of these men. It gives her an excuse to show us that she is inherently seduction, not deliberately so. It provides a footing for love that is outside of sex, and though based on obsession and addiction transcends them by using them. Everett really seems to understand this. Its his best performance by far. You almost fall in love with him instead of her by misdirection, because that's where the passion is. So it works, sex without sex, love by capture. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.

    A very lousy cast (Meyers, Argento, Harris, Everett) are very miscast in a mostly crappy and very pointless film. But none is more miscast than Asia, though. Argento plays one of those dangerous criminal goyls that only exist in the minds of movie-writers: she's rough and tough -IF you'll believe it. To make her (even) tougher they made her say "f***" about a hundred times, yet every time she said the word it was as funny and fresh as the first time. Fortunately, she takes her clothes off nearly as often as she says "f***", and she does look good in the nude. Harris is his usual ugly, uncharismatic, untalented self, so the fact that he's miscast is a mere irrelevancy; although the fact that he plays an impotent man does have a ring of truth about it. This nepotistic thespian shouldn't B. in movies, period. Everett lacks credibility and overplays his "cool cat" routine too often. The movie is absurd, has some rather "duh" dialog, and the only things going for it are its nice visual quality, the fact that it isn't too boring, and, of course Asia's nudity. With a cast like this, it would have been naive to expect a better movie. If you want a complete listing of Hollywood's nepotist actors and actresses, with pictures and explanations, e-mail me.

    I am not a lover of gangster movies , am very squeamish so I avoided this for a long time. I wanted to watch Rupert Everett's films after reading his extraordinary auto-bio. There are some excellent reviews here already , far better than anything I could write. I have never seen Jared Harris in anything but he is perfect in this roll. He even tries to talk down psychopaths with primary teacher talk. The pencil in cheek scene was particularly amazing for me as it happened to my daughter so she was home-educated as a result. The chaos of an inner-city school is perfectly portrayed. There probably is too much sex but I wasn't bothered it probably brought in a few viewers and frankly having breasts myself they don't bother me. Rupert Everett was excellent as the louche drug addict who seemed to be giving up on life bit by bit. Towards the end he is frightened but is too far gone to really know how to help himself. The channel had a discussion on addiction on before which made it rather more poignant. The cold killer gangsters were good , Bruno was chilling because as a Mum I wonder how easy it is to become a rent boy/gangster desperately seeking love . I am not so sure Monkey/Beatrice will stay a happy housewife but that's another story.

    This is a film that I've seen a while ago and I find it quite memorable. Starring Asia Argento and Jared Harris in lead roles and Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in supporting roles, it is an unusual cross between a thriller and a melodrama, with equal amounts of love scenes, violence and suspense. This was my introduction to both Argento and Harris and they both pleased me with their performances, especially the lovely Asia who looks so sultry and seductive here. Also Everett and Rhys-Meyers make this film more interesting with their love/hate relationship that ultimately ends with blood. Everett is at his most seductive here as well and he even gets a brief "love scene" with Asia. "B. Monkey" is a quite enjoyable film and the storyline is pretty well-crafted, keeping the suspense until the very end. In contrast to many other such "sex thrillers", this film also works well as a drama, especially from the angle of the male protagonist. Harris' character is not a traditional hero, but an impotent teacher who is trying to help a violent child. This part shows how noble and caring men are often getting trampled at by loathsome persons, in this case the child's abusive and utterly despicable mother. This makes "B. Monkey" a mixed bag that aims to please fans of both drama and thrillers.

    Beatrice(Asia Argento) is a thief who comes into the life of teacher/DJ Alan(Jared Harris), bringing a little excitement and a little trouble. It's a plot that has been done better before and B. Monkey doesn't bring anything new to the genre. The cast, which also includes John Rhys Meyers ans Rupert Everett as B. partners in crime, make it worth watching. Jared Harris looks like that teacher with the hot wife that nobody quite knows why she is with him, John Rhys Meyers is perhaps Asia's male partner in pretty, and Rupert Everett is Rupert Everett as always. Most of the attention goes to Asia Argento as she plays another tortured character. The best thing on display in this movie is her body, in the tub, on the bed, and with a gun thrust in front of her bare breasts. That is a good reason to love you.

    ... this is one of my favourite films. I just can't help loving it. It's certainly not a great film, it doesn't aim for the artistic highground. By most measures, this is a 6.5 at best. The script's loose in places, as is the acting on occasions and the whole thing feels as if it needed just one more take. But the characters make it special. Asia Argento, Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys Myers are perfectly cast and really inhabit their roles. Their characters and the relationships between them give real depth and believability to a hackneyed story. If you approach this expecting a quirky and very charming film, you're in for a treat. If you've been fooled by the artwork on the cover and expect a thriller, replete with car chases and gunplay, you may be disappointed.

    The posters and DVD arts project this to be a sexy crime thriller about a female bank or jewel robber or something. Instead, it's a romantic drama with a touch of crime thriller here and there but nothing like what you'd have expected. I don't mind the film for what it is. Beatrice (Bee-Ah-Trich-E) is a lovely Italian woman who has gone the straight after a career as an armed robber. She still keeps in touch with a few of her old friends from that life, but mainly, she has gone straight. I wasn't sure if this film was going anywhere interesting, then it turned into a romantic drama when Beatrice meets a guy named Alan (Jared Harris) who works at a classical radio station by night and teaches young kids in school by day. If you want to appreciate the European art/sex film elements of this film, such as full frontal nudity and wild sex scenes, then it will entertain you in that way for a while, as Beatrice and her new lover struggle with his impotence, bad oysters and getting to know each other. When a friend of B's, played by the luscious Jonathan Rhys-Meyers comes into the scene, suddenly there's an actual 2 way plot going somewhere, but this is not until at least 1/3 or 2/3 into the movie. A very troubled (downright psychotic) kid at Alan's school stabs another child with a pencil, the whole thing turns ugly and suddenly Alan is faced with losing his teaching job. At the same time, B's friend needs her to come out of retirement to help him get some debts cleared up. Asia Argento is a fun actress to watch, even if she's not the greatest actress ever. Still, this film seems to not be able to make up its mind what it wanted to be. It's entertaining in some ways, but not exciting enough for me to recommend.

    As some others have said, this film is carried in large measure by its central players. While some plot dynamics are typical of the genre, I disagree with the claims some have made that the plot itself is weak. There are, in fact, some plot elements that constitute unique dramatic formulations, at least relative to English-language films. There are numerous social and cultural themes that are woven into the storyline. Substance abuse and other modes of addiction are incorporated. Domestic violence, too, comes into play. The film itself does not offer much in the way of commentary on these sociocultural facets, and the portrayal of broader social themes appears primarily to serve as a vehicle for character development. The soundtrack is excellent and incorporates quality jazz instrumental tracks as well as contributions from the critically acclaimed band Portishead. The presence of jazz on the soundtrack is paralleled by its presence in the story, so much so in fact that jazz itself takes on thematic and symbolic values. The cinematography is of a high quality, and is characterized by rich, vibrant images. The selection of images and their composition serve several purposes, one of which is to orient the viewer to shifts within the direction of the story. Such mechanisms enjoy considerable subtlety and their use strikes me as neither pretentious nor overly ambitious. Asia Argento deserves special mention, and not just because she is easily one of today's most attractive actresses. Although she is not the only exceptional actor in this cast, it is Argento that really makes the film.

    Asia Argento is a cinema goddess that plays a thief active in London's underbelly. She's caught up in strange love triangle between her male crime partner and his straight laced lover. Each wanting the other. When the two gay lovers split Asia slowly corrupts the straight laced character. The acting by every one is robust and intense. Asia Argento once again proves in B. Monkey why she should be considered a great actor. I love her European attitude view of nudity. She has no problem taking her clothes off showing her body. That line in a John Mayer song about a wonderland had to be made in honor of Asia Argento. B. Monkey is a story that touches on what it's like to live on the edge of society. I was engrossed in this cinematic masterpiece from minute one.
