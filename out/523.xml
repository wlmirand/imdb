  A man refuses to conform to life in a rural prison.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Luke Jackson is a cool, gutsy prisoner in a Southern chain gang, who, while refusing to buckle under to authority, keeps escaping and being recaptured. The prisoners admire Luke because, as Dragline explains it, "You're an original, that's what you are!" Nevertheless, the camp staff actively works to crush Luke until he finally breaks.

    Cool Hand Luke is a film about a man who is sent to a rural prison for taking off the heads of parking meters. At the prison, he becomes part of the chain gang dealing with hot, back-breaking road work. As this man lives in prison, he becomes the short-talking, cool inmate that can either get under your skin or become your best friend. Of course as time goes by, his cool personality gets him into trouble by constantly breaking out of prison and being put back in. At the end of the film once you this his "cool" mind is put to rest, he breaks out of prison again to see what the Almighty has left for him to live for; and that is nothing can get you a pretty cool hand. This is a well-made film although it does have some minor flaws including over-dramaticism and unrealistic situations. Cool Hand Luke is a decent prison film but it surely is no Shawshank. But watch this movie and receive some sentimental, witty laughs.

    From the great mood the music sets for the movie, to classic one-liners "What we have here is a failure to communicate.", to the excellent acting, this movie is a classic. This movie will never get old. Classic scenes like the convicts squirming while watching the car getting watched, to everyone's favorite (and mine)...the egg-eating contest, to the iconic way they ask for permission: "Getting water, Boss!" "Taking my shirt off, Boss." Hopefully, Hollywood never ruins this movie by attempting to remake it, as seems to be the case during this era of movie-making. It was done exactly right the first time, and I hope it stays that way. Dim the lights, grab some popcorn, and enjoy this movie again; for those that have never seen it, a special treat is in store for you. Enjoy!

    I was not aware of this movie until recently, and i watched it by accident on TV. I was astonished, period. Great scenario, great acting,great direction, what more to say! Paul Newman is at his best, and so is George Kennedy! Dennis Hopper holds a small part but is quite good. The movie captures you from the first minute till the last. And you are easily attached with the characters. i really want to describe many scenes that i consider magnificent, but i respect the no spoiler rule, so i would just say that the scene with the eggs is more than hilarious!! Overall, i highly recommend it obviously! For your info, unlike what others might say, this is not so much like the Great Escape. It is far more emotional and less funny!

    For anyone having missed this tour de force by Newman, what a TREAT to recommend. There's enough symbolism, strength & edge to make this movie last a lifetime. It never grows old. The egg swallowing scene is up there with "are you talking to me" in Taxi-drive or other legendary movie. And GOD is Paul easy on the eyes. Of all the amaaazing films he compiled in his tremendous film career, to me, this is his finest accomplishment. And the character actors surrounding him only benefit & heighten its measure along the way. One not to be left out of any film aficiando's portfolio! And for those critics out there claiming it's OUTdated & not relevant, I say, don't be so quick to judge, slow down & drink this one in & THINK about the messages involved here.

    'Cool Hand Luke' is the (long) story of a charismatic misfit in a Southern segregated convict road gang. There is an interesting turning point in the film where Luke (Paul Newman) refuses to shelter from a deadly(?) rainstorm with the rest of the gang, and defies God to do anything to him; his character is defined by this sort of bravado. In the next scene, he learns that his beloved mother has died and the famous 'Plastic Jesus' song scene follows. Luke then simply becomes reckless and hurtles towards his doom. The problem with the film is that this interesting pivotal moment - his mother's death and how Luke might feel he had provoked God - is all but obliterated in the corny dramatisation of the convicts' lives. Clich&eacute;s abound; apart from the effective depiction of the back-breaking work of the gang, the compound seems to be more like a frat house. Perfect hairstyles, no fights except on Saturdays, plenty of food and booze, and basically everybody manages to keep their chins up, play poker and have a good laugh most of the time. Other reviewers have cited the 'Hogan's Heroes' and 'Bilko' similarities. They're right. So what could be a really affecting story just turns out to be a series of upbeat and downbeat setpieces, with a 'modern' nihilistic ending. Actually, there's a completely irrelevant bit tacked on after that where George Kennedy tells the gang what a 'world-shaker' Luke was. No he wasn't, he was possibly a complicated character but we learn nothing about what he really feels or why he did what he did. Whether that's Paul Newman's or the script's fault I can't tell, but Paul Newman does his overblown 'Hustler' performance, chewing more scenery than eggs in the process. A curate's egg, even - a few parts of this bad egg are excellent.

    This is one of those films I managed to not see for decades. When I finally saw it recently, I was left at quite a loss. What is it that draws people to watch bored characters make themselves into losers for no good reason? In Cool Hand Luke, the main character, Luke, played by Paul Newman, ends up in prison for a short sentence he earned by destroying public property (parking meters). For anyone with any shred of common sense, serving the short sentence would be enough. Get in, get out, lesson learned. But, to make the story interesting, Luke manages to create friction where there was none, for no good reason other than tendency to self-destruct. He is not an anti-conformist, not very smart, and not really having much of a goal. He is healthy, and perfectly capable of earning a living. But he decides to go down in flames, albeit with questionable style. I found it torturing to watch dumb character doing dumb things. In few instances we see Luke trying to talk to God, but the "conversation" is lacking, uninspiring and pointless. Those moments make Luke sound like a spoiled, self-absorbed, angry teen. Perhaps the book's author and filmmakers would like to believe that Cool Hand Luke is a story about someone who was wronged, or searching for God, or inspiring others to be different, but it is none of those. This film falls flat on its face in all departments, and earns only high marks for its shallowness and decent performances. For a truly great story about anti-conformism, one should watch One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest. Cool Hand Luke is nowhere near that. All in all, this depressing, pointless story is the best way to ruin your evening. I gave it 2 stars only for Paul Newman's performance, otherwise, it would be a firm zero.

    - A With one the best performances I've ever seen with Paul Newman, Cool Hand Luke is one of the most fun movies ever as its about a man who gets arrested and treats his time locked away with joy, humor, and friendship. The film is brilliantly written and told as the dialog is fun and serious at times. The events done from future friends having a fist fight, to Luke eating a crap load of eggs. The escape scenes are fun as they are clever and fun to watch others take part. Luke is chill, and cool with a great attitude and a load of brains. The ending is silly, not for how it is done, but for why I heard what they did as it shows how silly they might be in making sure something doesn't happen. Well this is surely a great film and should have been nominated and won in the 1968 Oscars for best picture.

    Paul Newman made many excellent movies, among them are The Hustler, Hud, The Verdict, The Sting, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, and this very film, Cool Hand Luke. Cool Hand Luke is by all means an excellent picture, and it's a great movie about a man who refuses to reform to life in prison. This is one of the best movies that I've ever seen, it's one of the best movies of 1967, and it's one of the best movies of the 1960's as a whole. In this movie, Paul Newman plays Lucas Jackson, a man who on one drunken night, gets arrested for cutting the heads off a town's parking meters, and he's sent to prison to conform, but instead of giving in to their demands, he holds his ground and finds ways to escape his prison life. Paul Newman was outstanding, this is one of (if not the best) the best movies that he's ever made. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, but he lost to Rod Steiger for his performance in In The Heat Of The Night, that's stiff competition, as both performances were outstanding, and as a matter of fact, it's really hard to decide which one did a better job. As I said in the previous paragraph, Paul Newman is fabulous, and so are the other cast members. George Kennedy gives a performance that's equal in greatness to Newman's as Dragline, a fellow prisoner who becomes friends with Lucas Jackson. On Oscar night, Kennedy walked away with the award for Best Supporting Actor, a win that he rightfully deserved. Strother Martin was great as the ruthless Captain, who says one of the most famous lines from any movie in all of movie history: "What we've got here is failure to communicate." And although he's the silent type, Morgan Woodward is menacing as "the man with no eyes" Boss Godfrey. Everybody in the movie was wonderful, but the performances from Paul Newman and George Kennedy were the best. Paul Newman (may he rest in peace) was a sensation, and there is no doubt that his talent will be missed. I know that I will certainly miss him, as he was in quite a few movies that are among some of the best I've ever seen. Cool Hand Luke is a movie that is definite required viewing, you will see Paul Newman like you've never seen him before, and as a matter of fact, you will probably never think of him in the same way again after you watch this film, as here, he is in a class all by himself. So all in all, you have definitely got to see this remarkable film, as not only is it a great movie starring Paul Newman, it's a great movie as a whole! In fact, this movie is so good, that you will most likely end up watching it multiple times because of the sheer greatness in it. I was surprised when I watched it. Beforehand, I was expecting to see a movie with great acting and storytelling, but when I watched it, I got more, I got a movie with fabulous acting and storytelling. Want to see an excellent Paul Newman film, then watch Cool Hand Luke, as it's excellent, or even better, it's more than excellent, it's a marvel for the film industry, and a timeless and unforgettable classic. 10/10

    Watching this movie was a massive letdown for me. It was supposed to be a gem of American cinematography -- instead, what we've got here is a failure to enjoy even a few minutes of it. I'm sorry, but the direction seemed particularly weak to me -- and only afterwards, I learned that this was Stuart Rosenberg's directorial debut. Oh heavens, but it showed! It took me literally four attempts to get through this turgid movie; it couldn't possibly be moving slower; there is no clear narrative line -- only disjointed episodes, and once you've seen the first 5 of them, you know that the remaining two dozen or so will be just more of the same. This movie is affectation from start to finish. Sorry, I did not see it as realistic -- rather, as a movie *playing a game* called "Let's be brutally realistic." But that's exactly what's wrong: you can see, the whole time, that this is just a movie *affecting* realism. The actors appearing here, led by the super-handsome Paul Newman, are *not* real prisoners. Sorry, but they're just too clean-cut, their hairstyles are more admirable than this reviewer's hairstyle has ever been... and when Paul Newman is supposed to look disheveled, you can see that it's just make-up artists at work. Imagine an ugly actor playing the part of Luke -- would this movie have been such a huge hit? I'm certain it wouldn't; Newman carries the movie on his shoulders, with his boyish charm, yet he is just as affected as everyone else. The most annoying character, to me, was the one played by George Kennedy. Sorry, I couldn't picture Kennedy as a real prisoner for a single minute. He was an *actor* playing a prisoner -- that's all. I just didn't buy his portrayal and couldn't buy it, no matter how much I strove to suspend my disbelief. Awarding an Oscar for such a histrionic performance is something I can't possibly fathom -- perhaps, as sometimes happens with Oscars, it was awarded to Kennedy as a summary appreciation for all of his work in all his other previous movies. There is no doubt that _Cool Hand Luke_ features lots of great actors -- so the blame for the movie's failure to impress must be assigned to the director. It's primarily the director's job to ensure that actors don't fall into that trap of appearing to be just theatrical actors, not real persons. Don't get me wrong: it wasn't the movie's unsavory milieu that put me off. Although I'm no fan of prison movies, I have great regard for a true classic like _The Shawshank Redemption_; I also quite enjoyed Stanley Kramer's similarly themed (prison escape) _The Defiant Ones_, or _The Green Mile_ with Tom Hanks. But no matter how much I tried, and how much I appreciate Paul Newman as an actor, I just couldn't enjoy _Cool Hand Luke_ one bit. Oh yes, _Cool Hand Luke_ features a classic quotation about the failure to communicate -- but one such catchphrase is not enough to rescue such a monumental bore of 2 hours' length. If one wished to be sarcastic, one might say the catchphrase is so good because, as the screenwriter admitted, it appeared "subconsciously" in his mind as he was writing the script -- without him intending to use the phrase at all. Seeing as those things that the movie's creators apparently *did* intend to accomplish, didn't pan out, it's probably good he did not intend to create a classic catchphrase -- because that conscious intention would probably have misfired like the rest of the movie.

    Cool Hand Luke is one of those films. You know, one of those which everybody loves and calls the greatest films ever made but you just don't seem to enjoy that much. I don't think it's bad or even mediocre, but Cool Hand Luke just wasn't that entertaining. I should mention first the thing that made a good impression on me. Paul Newman gives a really great performance. Without him, Cool Hand Luke would have fallen apart for me. His screen presence and charisma carried the more boring and uninteresting parts of the film. Also the story was really good. Sadly it was watered down by the era it came out. If it was made in the 70's or any other era, Cool Hand Luke would have been much more effective and memorable. And here we come to the first problem. First off, I don't particularly like whimsical pre-seventies prison films. I tend to like more the exploitative sub-genres of prison films like Female Prisoner Scorpion over the "classier" stuff. In other words, Cool Hand Luke is too tame for my taste and lacks a real punch to the gut feeling the 70's films offer. Another element that doesn't work for me is the rest of the cast. I did like Harry Dean Stanton in the film, the rest of the cast were just boring and lacking anything memorable about them. Most of the just acted like mentally handicapped people instead of acting like convicted criminals or real people. And last element that didn't work was the direction. Cool Hand Luke needed a more inventive camera work and visuals. The overall direction was bland and lacked any spark of creativity. Bust despite it's flaws, Cool Hand Luke is an entertaining film. It was never boring or dragged. The pacing was excellent and Paul Newman kept me involved. Sadly my love of the more cynical and exploitative Meiko Kaji films kept me from loving it. Cool Hand Luke is a must see for anyone who is a big fan of Paul Newman. It's probably one of his most recognizable performances with The Hustler, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting. If you happen to enjoy smart prison films over sleaze, boobs and Meiko Kaji then this is your kind of film. But as for me, I'll stick to my sleaze instead.

    Paul Newman made many excellent movies, among them are The Hustler, Hud, The Verdict, The Sting, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, and this very film, Cool Hand Luke. Cool Hand Luke is by all means an excellent picture, and it's a great movie about a man who refuses to reform to life in prison. This is one of the best movies that I've ever seen, it's one of the best movies of 1967, and it's one of the best movies of the 1960's as a whole. In this movie, Paul Newman plays Lucas Jackson, a man who on one drunken night, gets arrested for cutting the heads off a town's parking meters, and he's sent to prison to conform, but instead of giving in to their demands, he holds his ground and finds ways to escape his prison life. Paul Newman was outstanding, this is one of (if not the best) the best movies that he's ever made. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, but he lost to Rod Steiger for his performance in In The Heat Of The Night, that's stiff competition, as both performances were outstanding, and as a matter of fact, it's really hard to decide which one did a better job. As I said in the previous paragraph, Paul Newman is fabulous, and so are the other cast members. George Kennedy gives a performance that's equal in greatness to Newman's as Dragline, a fellow prisoner who becomes friends with Lucas Jackson. On Oscar night, Kennedy walked away with the award for Best Supporting Actor, a win that he rightfully deserved. Strother Martin was great as the ruthless Captain, who says one of the most famous lines from any movie in all of movie history: "What we've got here is failure to communicate." And although he's the silent type, Morgan Woodward is menacing as "the man with no eyes" Boss Godfrey. Everybody in the movie was wonderful, but the performances from Paul Newman and George Kennedy were the best. Paul Newman (may he rest in peace) was a sensation, and there is no doubt that his talent will be missed. I know that I will certainly miss him, as he was in quite a few movies that are among some of the best I've ever seen. Cool Hand Luke is a movie that is definite required viewing, you will see Paul Newman like you've never seen him before, and as a matter of fact, you will probably never think of him in the same way again after you watch this film, as here, he is in a class all by himself. So all in all, you have definitely got to see this remarkable film, as not only is it a great movie starring Paul Newman, it's a great movie as a whole! In fact, this movie is so good, that you will most likely end up watching it multiple times because of the sheer greatness in it. I was surprised when I watched it. Beforehand, I was expecting to see a movie with great acting and storytelling, but when I watched it, I got more, I got a movie with fabulous acting and storytelling. Want to see an excellent Paul Newman film, then watch Cool Hand Luke, as it's excellent, or even better, it's more than excellent, it's a marvel for the film industry, and a timeless and unforgettable classic. 10/10

    Watching this movie was a massive letdown for me. It was supposed to be a gem of American cinematography -- instead, what we've got here is a failure to enjoy even a few minutes of it. I'm sorry, but the direction seemed particularly weak to me -- and only afterwards, I learned that this was Stuart Rosenberg's directorial debut. Oh heavens, but it showed! It took me literally four attempts to get through this turgid movie; it couldn't possibly be moving slower; there is no clear narrative line -- only disjointed episodes, and once you've seen the first 5 of them, you know that the remaining two dozen or so will be just more of the same. This movie is affectation from start to finish. Sorry, I did not see it as realistic -- rather, as a movie *playing a game* called "Let's be brutally realistic." But that's exactly what's wrong: you can see, the whole time, that this is just a movie *affecting* realism. The actors appearing here, led by the super-handsome Paul Newman, are *not* real prisoners. Sorry, but they're just too clean-cut, their hairstyles are more admirable than this reviewer's hairstyle has ever been... and when Paul Newman is supposed to look disheveled, you can see that it's just make-up artists at work. Imagine an ugly actor playing the part of Luke -- would this movie have been such a huge hit? I'm certain it wouldn't; Newman carries the movie on his shoulders, with his boyish charm, yet he is just as affected as everyone else. The most annoying character, to me, was the one played by George Kennedy. Sorry, I couldn't picture Kennedy as a real prisoner for a single minute. He was an *actor* playing a prisoner -- that's all. I just didn't buy his portrayal and couldn't buy it, no matter how much I strove to suspend my disbelief. Awarding an Oscar for such a histrionic performance is something I can't possibly fathom -- perhaps, as sometimes happens with Oscars, it was awarded to Kennedy as a summary appreciation for all of his work in all his other previous movies. There is no doubt that _Cool Hand Luke_ features lots of great actors -- so the blame for the movie's failure to impress must be assigned to the director. It's primarily the director's job to ensure that actors don't fall into that trap of appearing to be just theatrical actors, not real persons. Don't get me wrong: it wasn't the movie's unsavory milieu that put me off. Although I'm no fan of prison movies, I have great regard for a true classic like _The Shawshank Redemption_; I also quite enjoyed Stanley Kramer's similarly themed (prison escape) _The Defiant Ones_, or _The Green Mile_ with Tom Hanks. But no matter how much I tried, and how much I appreciate Paul Newman as an actor, I just couldn't enjoy _Cool Hand Luke_ one bit. Oh yes, _Cool Hand Luke_ features a classic quotation about the failure to communicate -- but one such catchphrase is not enough to rescue such a monumental bore of 2 hours' length. If one wished to be sarcastic, one might say the catchphrase is so good because, as the screenwriter admitted, it appeared "subconsciously" in his mind as he was writing the script -- without him intending to use the phrase at all. Seeing as those things that the movie's creators apparently *did* intend to accomplish, didn't pan out, it's probably good he did not intend to create a classic catchphrase -- because that conscious intention would probably have misfired like the rest of the movie.

    Cool Hand Luke is one of those films. You know, one of those which everybody loves and calls the greatest films ever made but you just don't seem to enjoy that much. I don't think it's bad or even mediocre, but Cool Hand Luke just wasn't that entertaining. I should mention first the thing that made a good impression on me. Paul Newman gives a really great performance. Without him, Cool Hand Luke would have fallen apart for me. His screen presence and charisma carried the more boring and uninteresting parts of the film. Also the story was really good. Sadly it was watered down by the era it came out. If it was made in the 70's or any other era, Cool Hand Luke would have been much more effective and memorable. And here we come to the first problem. First off, I don't particularly like whimsical pre-seventies prison films. I tend to like more the exploitative sub-genres of prison films like Female Prisoner Scorpion over the "classier" stuff. In other words, Cool Hand Luke is too tame for my taste and lacks a real punch to the gut feeling the 70's films offer. Another element that doesn't work for me is the rest of the cast. I did like Harry Dean Stanton in the film, the rest of the cast were just boring and lacking anything memorable about them. Most of the just acted like mentally handicapped people instead of acting like convicted criminals or real people. And last element that didn't work was the direction. Cool Hand Luke needed a more inventive camera work and visuals. The overall direction was bland and lacked any spark of creativity. Bust despite it's flaws, Cool Hand Luke is an entertaining film. It was never boring or dragged. The pacing was excellent and Paul Newman kept me involved. Sadly my love of the more cynical and exploitative Meiko Kaji films kept me from loving it. Cool Hand Luke is a must see for anyone who is a big fan of Paul Newman. It's probably one of his most recognizable performances with The Hustler, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting. If you happen to enjoy smart prison films over sleaze, boobs and Meiko Kaji then this is your kind of film. But as for me, I'll stick to my sleaze instead.

    Cool Hand Luke is a film about a man who is sent to a rural prison for taking off the heads of parking meters. At the prison, he becomes part of the chain gang dealing with hot, back-breaking road work. As this man lives in prison, he becomes the short-talking, cool inmate that can either get under your skin or become your best friend. Of course as time goes by, his cool personality gets him into trouble by constantly breaking out of prison and being put back in. At the end of the film once you this his "cool" mind is put to rest, he breaks out of prison again to see what the Almighty has left for him to live for; and that is nothing can get you a pretty cool hand. This is a well-made film although it does have some minor flaws including over-dramaticism and unrealistic situations. Cool Hand Luke is a decent prison film but it surely is no Shawshank. But watch this movie and receive some sentimental, witty laughs.

    From the great mood the music sets for the movie, to classic one-liners "What we have here is a failure to communicate.", to the excellent acting, this movie is a classic. This movie will never get old. Classic scenes like the convicts squirming while watching the car getting watched, to everyone's favorite (and mine)...the egg-eating contest, to the iconic way they ask for permission: "Getting water, Boss!" "Taking my shirt off, Boss." Hopefully, Hollywood never ruins this movie by attempting to remake it, as seems to be the case during this era of movie-making. It was done exactly right the first time, and I hope it stays that way. Dim the lights, grab some popcorn, and enjoy this movie again; for those that have never seen it, a special treat is in store for you. Enjoy!

    I was not aware of this movie until recently, and i watched it by accident on TV. I was astonished, period. Great scenario, great acting,great direction, what more to say! Paul Newman is at his best, and so is George Kennedy! Dennis Hopper holds a small part but is quite good. The movie captures you from the first minute till the last. And you are easily attached with the characters. i really want to describe many scenes that i consider magnificent, but i respect the no spoiler rule, so i would just say that the scene with the eggs is more than hilarious!! Overall, i highly recommend it obviously! For your info, unlike what others might say, this is not so much like the Great Escape. It is far more emotional and less funny!

    For anyone having missed this tour de force by Newman, what a TREAT to recommend. There's enough symbolism, strength & edge to make this movie last a lifetime. It never grows old. The egg swallowing scene is up there with "are you talking to me" in Taxi-drive or other legendary movie. And GOD is Paul easy on the eyes. Of all the amaaazing films he compiled in his tremendous film career, to me, this is his finest accomplishment. And the character actors surrounding him only benefit & heighten its measure along the way. One not to be left out of any film aficiando's portfolio! And for those critics out there claiming it's OUTdated & not relevant, I say, don't be so quick to judge, slow down & drink this one in & THINK about the messages involved here.

    'Cool Hand Luke' is the (long) story of a charismatic misfit in a Southern segregated convict road gang. There is an interesting turning point in the film where Luke (Paul Newman) refuses to shelter from a deadly(?) rainstorm with the rest of the gang, and defies God to do anything to him; his character is defined by this sort of bravado. In the next scene, he learns that his beloved mother has died and the famous 'Plastic Jesus' song scene follows. Luke then simply becomes reckless and hurtles towards his doom. The problem with the film is that this interesting pivotal moment - his mother's death and how Luke might feel he had provoked God - is all but obliterated in the corny dramatisation of the convicts' lives. Clich&eacute;s abound; apart from the effective depiction of the back-breaking work of the gang, the compound seems to be more like a frat house. Perfect hairstyles, no fights except on Saturdays, plenty of food and booze, and basically everybody manages to keep their chins up, play poker and have a good laugh most of the time. Other reviewers have cited the 'Hogan's Heroes' and 'Bilko' similarities. They're right. So what could be a really affecting story just turns out to be a series of upbeat and downbeat setpieces, with a 'modern' nihilistic ending. Actually, there's a completely irrelevant bit tacked on after that where George Kennedy tells the gang what a 'world-shaker' Luke was. No he wasn't, he was possibly a complicated character but we learn nothing about what he really feels or why he did what he did. Whether that's Paul Newman's or the script's fault I can't tell, but Paul Newman does his overblown 'Hustler' performance, chewing more scenery than eggs in the process. A curate's egg, even - a few parts of this bad egg are excellent.

    This is one of those films I managed to not see for decades. When I finally saw it recently, I was left at quite a loss. What is it that draws people to watch bored characters make themselves into losers for no good reason? In Cool Hand Luke, the main character, Luke, played by Paul Newman, ends up in prison for a short sentence he earned by destroying public property (parking meters). For anyone with any shred of common sense, serving the short sentence would be enough. Get in, get out, lesson learned. But, to make the story interesting, Luke manages to create friction where there was none, for no good reason other than tendency to self-destruct. He is not an anti-conformist, not very smart, and not really having much of a goal. He is healthy, and perfectly capable of earning a living. But he decides to go down in flames, albeit with questionable style. I found it torturing to watch dumb character doing dumb things. In few instances we see Luke trying to talk to God, but the "conversation" is lacking, uninspiring and pointless. Those moments make Luke sound like a spoiled, self-absorbed, angry teen. Perhaps the book's author and filmmakers would like to believe that Cool Hand Luke is a story about someone who was wronged, or searching for God, or inspiring others to be different, but it is none of those. This film falls flat on its face in all departments, and earns only high marks for its shallowness and decent performances. For a truly great story about anti-conformism, one should watch One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest. Cool Hand Luke is nowhere near that. All in all, this depressing, pointless story is the best way to ruin your evening. I gave it 2 stars only for Paul Newman's performance, otherwise, it would be a firm zero.

    - A With one the best performances I've ever seen with Paul Newman, Cool Hand Luke is one of the most fun movies ever as its about a man who gets arrested and treats his time locked away with joy, humor, and friendship. The film is brilliantly written and told as the dialog is fun and serious at times. The events done from future friends having a fist fight, to Luke eating a crap load of eggs. The escape scenes are fun as they are clever and fun to watch others take part. Luke is chill, and cool with a great attitude and a load of brains. The ending is silly, not for how it is done, but for why I heard what they did as it shows how silly they might be in making sure something doesn't happen. Well this is surely a great film and should have been nominated and won in the 1968 Oscars for best picture.

    Paul Newman made many excellent movies, among them are The Hustler, Hud, The Verdict, The Sting, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, and this very film, Cool Hand Luke. Cool Hand Luke is by all means an excellent picture, and it's a great movie about a man who refuses to reform to life in prison. This is one of the best movies that I've ever seen, it's one of the best movies of 1967, and it's one of the best movies of the 1960's as a whole.

    For anyone having missed this tour de force by Newman, what a TREAT to recommend. There's enough symbolism, strength & edge to make this movie last a lifetime. It never grows old. The egg swallowing scene is up there with "are you talking to me" in Taxi-drive or other legendary movie. And GOD is Paul easy on the eyes. Of all the amaaazing films he compiled in his tremendous film career, to me, this is his finest accomplishment. And the character actors surrounding him only benefit & heighten its measure along the way. One not to be left out of any film aficiando's portfolio! And for those critics out there claiming it's OUTdated & not relevant, I say, don't be so quick to judge, slow down & drink this one in & THINK about the messages involved here.

    'Cool Hand Luke' is the (long) story of a charismatic misfit in a Southern segregated convict road gang. There is an interesting turning point in the film where Luke (Paul Newman) refuses to shelter from a deadly(?) rainstorm with the rest of the gang, and defies God to do anything to him; his character is defined by this sort of bravado. In the next scene, he learns that his beloved mother has died and the famous 'Plastic Jesus' song scene follows. Luke then simply becomes reckless and hurtles towards his doom. The problem with the film is that this interesting pivotal moment - his mother's death and how Luke might feel he had provoked God - is all but obliterated in the corny dramatisation of the convicts' lives. Clich&eacute;s abound; apart from the effective depiction of the back-breaking work of the gang, the compound seems to be more like a frat house. Perfect hairstyles, no fights except on Saturdays, plenty of food and booze, and basically everybody manages to keep their chins up, play poker and have a good laugh most of the time. Other reviewers have cited the 'Hogan's Heroes' and 'Bilko' similarities. They're right. So what could be a really affecting story just turns out to be a series of upbeat and downbeat setpieces, with a 'modern' nihilistic ending. Actually, there's a completely irrelevant bit tacked on after that where George Kennedy tells the gang what a 'world-shaker' Luke was. No he wasn't, he was possibly a complicated character but we learn nothing about what he really feels or why he did what he did. Whether that's Paul Newman's or the script's fault I can't tell, but Paul Newman does his overblown 'Hustler' performance, chewing more scenery than eggs in the process. A curate's egg, even - a few parts of this bad egg are excellent.

    This is one of those films I managed to not see for decades. When I finally saw it recently, I was left at quite a loss. What is it that draws people to watch bored characters make themselves into losers for no good reason? In Cool Hand Luke, the main character, Luke, played by Paul Newman, ends up in prison for a short sentence he earned by destroying public property (parking meters). For anyone with any shred of common sense, serving the short sentence would be enough. Get in, get out, lesson learned. But, to make the story interesting, Luke manages to create friction where there was none, for no good reason other than tendency to self-destruct. He is not an anti-conformist, not very smart, and not really having much of a goal. He is healthy, and perfectly capable of earning a living. But he decides to go down in flames, albeit with questionable style. I found it torturing to watch dumb character doing dumb things. In few instances we see Luke trying to talk to God, but the "conversation" is lacking, uninspiring and pointless. Those moments make Luke sound like a spoiled, self-absorbed, angry teen. Perhaps the book's author and filmmakers would like to believe that Cool Hand Luke is a story about someone who was wronged, or searching for God, or inspiring others to be different, but it is none of those. This film falls flat on its face in all departments, and earns only high marks for its shallowness and decent performances. For a truly great story about anti-conformism, one should watch One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest. Cool Hand Luke is nowhere near that. All in all, this depressing, pointless story is the best way to ruin your evening. I gave it 2 stars only for Paul Newman's performance, otherwise, it would be a firm zero.

    - A With one the best performances I've ever seen with Paul Newman, Cool Hand Luke is one of the most fun movies ever as its about a man who gets arrested and treats his time locked away with joy, humor, and friendship. The film is brilliantly written and told as the dialog is fun and serious at times. The events done from future friends having a fist fight, to Luke eating a crap load of eggs. The escape scenes are fun as they are clever and fun to watch others take part. Luke is chill, and cool with a great attitude and a load of brains. The ending is silly, not for how it is done, but for why I heard what they did as it shows how silly they might be in making sure something doesn't happen. Well this is surely a great film and should have been nominated and won in the 1968 Oscars for best picture.

    Paul Newman made many excellent movies, among them are The Hustler, Hud, The Verdict, The Sting, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, and this very film, Cool Hand Luke. Cool Hand Luke is by all means an excellent picture, and it's a great movie about a man who refuses to reform to life in prison. This is one of the best movies that I've ever seen, it's one of the best movies of 1967, and it's one of the best movies of the 1960's as a whole. In this movie, Paul Newman plays Lucas Jackson, a man who on one drunken night, gets arrested for cutting the heads off a town's parking meters, and he's sent to prison to conform, but instead of giving in to their demands, he holds his ground and finds ways to escape his prison life. Paul Newman was outstanding, this is one of (if not the best) the best movies that he's ever made. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, but he lost to Rod Steiger for his performance in In The Heat Of The Night, that's stiff competition, as both performances were outstanding, and as a matter of fact, it's really hard to decide which one did a better job. As I said in the previous paragraph, Paul Newman is fabulous, and so are the other cast members. George Kennedy gives a performance that's equal in greatness to Newman's as Dragline, a fellow prisoner who becomes friends with Lucas Jackson. On Oscar night, Kennedy walked away with the award for Best Supporting Actor, a win that he rightfully deserved. Strother Martin was great as the ruthless Captain, who says one of the most famous lines from any movie in all of movie history: "What we've got here is failure to communicate." And although he's the silent type, Morgan Woodward is menacing as "the man with no eyes" Boss Godfrey. Everybody in the movie was wonderful, but the performances from Paul Newman and George Kennedy were the best. Paul Newman (may he rest in peace) was a sensation, and there is no doubt that his talent will be missed. I know that I will certainly miss him, as he was in quite a few movies that are among some of the best I've ever seen. Cool Hand Luke is a movie that is definite required viewing, you will see Paul Newman like you've never seen him before, and as a matter of fact, you will probably never think of him in the same way again after you watch this film, as here, he is in a class all by himself. So all in all, you have definitely got to see this remarkable film, as not only is it a great movie starring Paul Newman, it's a great movie as a whole! In fact, this movie is so good, that you will most likely end up watching it multiple times because of the sheer greatness in it. I was surprised when I watched it. Beforehand, I was expecting to see a movie with great acting and storytelling, but when I watched it, I got more, I got a movie with fabulous acting and storytelling. Want to see an excellent Paul Newman film, then watch Cool Hand Luke, as it's excellent, or even better, it's more than excellent, it's a marvel for the film industry, and a timeless and unforgettable classic. 10/10

    Watching this movie was a massive letdown for me. It was supposed to be a gem of American cinematography -- instead, what we've got here is a failure to enjoy even a few minutes of it. I'm sorry, but the direction seemed particularly weak to me -- and only afterwards, I learned that this was Stuart Rosenberg's directorial debut. Oh heavens, but it showed! It took me literally four attempts to get through this turgid movie; it couldn't possibly be moving slower; there is no clear narrative line -- only disjointed episodes, and once you've seen the first 5 of them, you know that the remaining two dozen or so will be just more of the same. This movie is affectation from start to finish. Sorry, I did not see it as realistic -- rather, as a movie *playing a game* called "Let's be brutally realistic." But that's exactly what's wrong: you can see, the whole time, that this is just a movie *affecting* realism. The actors appearing here, led by the super-handsome Paul Newman, are *not* real prisoners. Sorry, but they're just too clean-cut, their hairstyles are more admirable than this reviewer's hairstyle has ever been... and when Paul Newman is supposed to look disheveled, you can see that it's just make-up artists at work. Imagine an ugly actor playing the part of Luke -- would this movie have been such a huge hit? I'm certain it wouldn't; Newman carries the movie on his shoulders, with his boyish charm, yet he is just as affected as everyone else. The most annoying character, to me, was the one played by George Kennedy. Sorry, I couldn't picture Kennedy as a real prisoner for a single minute. He was an *actor* playing a prisoner -- that's all. I just didn't buy his portrayal and couldn't buy it, no matter how much I strove to suspend my disbelief. Awarding an Oscar for such a histrionic performance is something I can't possibly fathom -- perhaps, as sometimes happens with Oscars, it was awarded to Kennedy as a summary appreciation for all of his work in all his other previous movies. There is no doubt that _Cool Hand Luke_ features lots of great actors -- so the blame for the movie's failure to impress must be assigned to the director. It's primarily the director's job to ensure that actors don't fall into that trap of appearing to be just theatrical actors, not real persons. Don't get me wrong: it wasn't the movie's unsavory milieu that put me off. Although I'm no fan of prison movies, I have great regard for a true classic like _The Shawshank Redemption_; I also quite enjoyed Stanley Kramer's similarly themed (prison escape) _The Defiant Ones_, or _The Green Mile_ with Tom Hanks. But no matter how much I tried, and how much I appreciate Paul Newman as an actor, I just couldn't enjoy _Cool Hand Luke_ one bit. Oh yes, _Cool Hand Luke_ features a classic quotation about the failure to communicate -- but one such catchphrase is not enough to rescue such a monumental bore of 2 hours' length. If one wished to be sarcastic, one might say the catchphrase is so good because, as the screenwriter admitted, it appeared "subconsciously" in his mind as he was writing the script -- without him intending to use the phrase at all. Seeing as those things that the movie's creators apparently *did* intend to accomplish, didn't pan out, it's probably good he did not intend to create a classic catchphrase -- because that conscious intention would probably have misfired like the rest of the movie.

    Cool Hand Luke is one of those films. You know, one of those which everybody loves and calls the greatest films ever made but you just don't seem to enjoy that much. I don't think it's bad or even mediocre, but Cool Hand Luke just wasn't that entertaining. I should mention first the thing that made a good impression on me. Paul Newman gives a really great performance. Without him, Cool Hand Luke would have fallen apart for me. His screen presence and charisma carried the more boring and uninteresting parts of the film. Also the story was really good. Sadly it was watered down by the era it came out. If it was made in the 70's or any other era, Cool Hand Luke would have been much more effective and memorable. And here we come to the first problem. First off, I don't particularly like whimsical pre-seventies prison films. I tend to like more the exploitative sub-genres of prison films like Female Prisoner Scorpion over the "classier" stuff. In other words, Cool Hand Luke is too tame for my taste and lacks a real punch to the gut feeling the 70's films offer. Another element that doesn't work for me is the rest of the cast. I did like Harry Dean Stanton in the film, the rest of the cast were just boring and lacking anything memorable about them. Most of the just acted like mentally handicapped people instead of acting like convicted criminals or real people. And last element that didn't work was the direction. Cool Hand Luke needed a more inventive camera work and visuals. The overall direction was bland and lacked any spark of creativity. Bust despite it's flaws, Cool Hand Luke is an entertaining film. It was never boring or dragged. The pacing was excellent and Paul Newman kept me involved. Sadly my love of the more cynical and exploitative Meiko Kaji films kept me from loving it. Cool Hand Luke is a must see for anyone who is a big fan of Paul Newman. It's probably one of his most recognizable performances with The Hustler, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting. If you happen to enjoy smart prison films over sleaze, boobs and Meiko Kaji then this is your kind of film. But as for me, I'll stick to my sleaze instead.

    Cool Hand Luke is a film about a man who is sent to a rural prison for taking off the heads of parking meters. At the prison, he becomes part of the chain gang dealing with hot, back-breaking road work. As this man lives in prison, he becomes the short-talking, cool inmate that can either get under your skin or become your best friend. Of course as time goes by, his cool personality gets him into trouble by constantly breaking out of prison and being put back in. At the end of the film once you this his "cool" mind is put to rest, he breaks out of prison again to see what the Almighty has left for him to live for; and that is nothing can get you a pretty cool hand. This is a well-made film although it does have some minor flaws including over-dramaticism and unrealistic situations. Cool Hand Luke is a decent prison film but it surely is no Shawshank. But watch this movie and receive some sentimental, witty laughs.

    From the great mood the music sets for the movie, to classic one-liners "What we have here is a failure to communicate.", to the excellent acting, this movie is a classic. This movie will never get old. Classic scenes like the convicts squirming while watching the car getting watched, to everyone's favorite (and mine)...the egg-eating contest, to the iconic way they ask for permission: "Getting water, Boss!" "Taking my shirt off, Boss." Hopefully, Hollywood never ruins this movie by attempting to remake it, as seems to be the case during this era of movie-making. It was done exactly right the first time, and I hope it stays that way. Dim the lights, grab some popcorn, and enjoy this movie again; for those that have never seen it, a special treat is in store for you. Enjoy!

    I was not aware of this movie until recently, and i watched it by accident on TV. I was astonished, period. Great scenario, great acting,great direction, what more to say! Paul Newman is at his best, and so is George Kennedy! Dennis Hopper holds a small part but is quite good. The movie captures you from the first minute till the last. And you are easily attached with the characters. i really want to describe many scenes that i consider magnificent, but i respect the no spoiler rule, so i would just say that the scene with the eggs is more than hilarious!! Overall, i highly recommend it obviously! For your info, unlike what others might say, this is not so much like the Great Escape. It is far more emotional and less funny!

Oh yes, _Cool Hand Luke_ features a classic quotation about the failure to communicate -- but one such catchphrase is not enough to rescue such a monumental bore of 2 hours' length. If one wished to be sarcastic, one might say the catchphrase is so good because, as the screenwriter admitted, it appeared "subconsciously" in his mind as he was writing the script -- without him intending to use the phrase at all. Seeing as those things that the movie's creators apparently *did* intend to accomplish, didn't pan out, it's probably good he did not intend to create a classic catchphrase -- because that conscious intention would probably have misfired like the rest of the movie.

    Cool Hand Luke is one of those films. You know, one of those which everybody loves and calls the greatest films ever made but you just don't seem to enjoy that much. I don't think it's bad or even mediocre, but Cool Hand Luke just wasn't that entertaining. I should mention first the thing that made a good impression on me. Paul Newman gives a really great performance. Without him, Cool Hand Luke would have fallen apart for me. His screen presence and charisma carried the more boring and uninteresting parts of the film. Also the story was really good. Sadly it was watered down by the era it came out. If it was made in the 70's or any other era, Cool Hand Luke would have been much more effective and memorable. And here we come to the first problem. First off, I don't particularly like whimsical pre-seventies prison films. I tend to like more the exploitative sub-genres of prison films like Female Prisoner Scorpion over the "classier" stuff. In other words, Cool Hand Luke is too tame for my taste and lacks a real punch to the gut feeling the 70's films offer. Another element that doesn't work for me is the rest of the cast. I did like Harry Dean Stanton in the film, the rest of the cast were just boring and lacking anything memorable about them. Most of the just acted like mentally handicapped people instead of acting like convicted criminals or real people. And last element that didn't work was the direction. Cool Hand Luke needed a more inventive camera work and visuals. The overall direction was bland and lacked any spark of creativity. Bust despite it's flaws, Cool Hand Luke is an entertaining film. It was never boring or dragged. The pacing was excellent and Paul Newman kept me involved. Sadly my love of the more cynical and exploitative Meiko Kaji films kept me from loving it. Cool Hand Luke is a must see for anyone who is a big fan of Paul Newman. It's probably one of his most recognizable performances with The Hustler, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting. If you happen to enjoy smart prison films over sleaze, boobs and Meiko Kaji then this is your kind of film. But as for me, I'll stick to my sleaze instead.

    Cool Hand Luke is a film about a man who is sent to a rural prison for taking off the heads of parking meters. At the prison, he becomes part of the chain gang dealing with hot, back-breaking road work. As this man lives in prison, he becomes the short-talking, cool inmate that can either get under your skin or become your best friend. Of course as time goes by, his cool personality gets him into trouble by constantly breaking out of prison and being put back in. At the end of the film once you this his "cool" mind is put to rest, he breaks out of prison again to see what the Almighty has left for him to live for; and that is nothing can get you a pretty cool hand. This is a well-made film although it does have some minor flaws including over-dramaticism and unrealistic situations. Cool Hand Luke is a decent prison film but it surely is no Shawshank. But watch this movie and receive some sentimental, witty laughs.

    From the great mood the music sets for the movie, to classic one-liners "What we have here is a failure to communicate.", to the excellent acting, this movie is a classic. This movie will never get old. Classic scenes like the convicts squirming while watching the car getting watched, to everyone's favorite (and mine)...the egg-eating contest, to the iconic way they ask for permission: "Getting water, Boss!" "Taking my shirt off, Boss." Hopefully, Hollywood never ruins this movie by attempting to remake it, as seems to be the case during this era of movie-making. It was done exactly right the first time, and I hope it stays that way. Dim the lights, grab some popcorn, and enjoy this movie again; for those that have never seen it, a special treat is in store for you. Enjoy!

    I was not aware of this movie until recently, and i watched it by accident on TV. I was astonished, period. Great scenario, great acting,great direction, what more to say! Paul Newman is at his best, and so is George Kennedy! Dennis Hopper holds a small part but is quite good. The movie captures you from the first minute till the last. And you are easily attached with the characters. i really want to describe many scenes that i consider magnificent, but i respect the no spoiler rule, so i would just say that the scene with the eggs is more than hilarious!! Overall, i highly recommend it obviously! For your info, unlike what others might say, this is not so much like the Great Escape. It is far more emotional and less funny!

    For anyone having missed this tour de force by Newman, what a TREAT to recommend. There's enough symbolism, strength & edge to make this movie last a lifetime. It never grows old. The egg swallowing scene is up there with "are you talking to me" in Taxi-drive or other legendary movie. And GOD is Paul easy on the eyes. Of all the amaaazing films he compiled in his tremendous film career, to me, this is his finest accomplishment. And the character actors surrounding him only benefit & heighten its measure along the way. One not to be left out of any film aficiando's portfolio! And for those critics out there claiming it's OUTdated & not relevant, I say, don't be so quick to judge, slow down & drink this one in & THINK about the messages involved here.

    'Cool Hand Luke' is the (long) story of a charismatic misfit in a Southern segregated convict road gang. There is an interesting turning point in the film where Luke (Paul Newman) refuses to shelter from a deadly(?) rainstorm with the rest of the gang, and defies God to do anything to him; his character is defined by this sort of bravado. In the next scene, he learns that his beloved mother has died and the famous 'Plastic Jesus' song scene follows. Luke then simply becomes reckless and hurtles towards his doom. The problem with the film is that this interesting pivotal moment - his mother's death and how Luke might feel he had provoked God - is all but obliterated in the corny dramatisation of the convicts' lives. Clich&eacute;s abound; apart from the effective depiction of the back-breaking work of the gang, the compound seems to be more like a frat house. Perfect hairstyles, no fights except on Saturdays, plenty of food and booze, and basically everybody manages to keep their chins up, play poker and have a good laugh most of the time. Other reviewers have cited the 'Hogan's Heroes' and 'Bilko' similarities. They're right. So what could be a really affecting story just turns out to be a series of upbeat and downbeat setpieces, with a 'modern' nihilistic ending. Actually, there's a completely irrelevant bit tacked on after that where George Kennedy tells the gang what a 'world-shaker' Luke was. No he wasn't, he was possibly a complicated character but we learn nothing about what he really feels or why he did what he did. Whether that's Paul Newman's or the script's fault I can't tell, but Paul Newman does his overblown 'Hustler' performance, chewing more scenery than eggs in the process. A curate's egg, even - a few parts of this bad egg are excellent.

    This is one of those films I managed to not see for decades. When I finally saw it recently, I was left at quite a loss. What is it that draws people to watch bored characters make themselves into losers for no good reason? In Cool Hand Luke, the main character, Luke, played by Paul Newman, ends up in prison for a short sentence he earned by destroying public property (parking meters). For anyone with any shred of common sense, serving the short sentence would be enough. Get in, get out, lesson learned. But, to make the story interesting, Luke manages to create friction where there was none, for no good reason other than tendency to self-destruct. He is not an anti-conformist, not very smart, and not really having much of a goal. He is healthy, and perfectly capable of earning a living. But he decides to go down in flames, albeit with questionable style. I found it torturing to watch dumb character doing dumb things. In few instances we see Luke trying to talk to God, but the "conversation" is lacking, uninspiring and pointless. Those moments make Luke sound like a spoiled, self-absorbed, angry teen. Perhaps the book's author and filmmakers would like to believe that Cool Hand Luke is a story about someone who was wronged, or searching for God, or inspiring others to be different, but it is none of those. This film falls flat on its face in all departments, and earns only high marks for its shallowness and decent performances. For a truly great story about anti-conformism, one should watch One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest. Cool Hand Luke is nowhere near that. All in all, this depressing, pointless story is the best way to ruin your evening. I gave it 2 stars only for Paul Newman's performance, otherwise, it would be a firm zero.

    - A With one the best performances I've ever seen with Paul Newman, Cool Hand Luke is one of the most fun movies ever as its about a man who gets arrested and treats his time locked away with joy, humor, and friendship. The film is brilliantly written and told as the dialog is fun and serious at times. The events done from future friends having a fist fight, to Luke eating a crap load of eggs. The escape scenes are fun as they are clever and fun to watch others take part. Luke is chill, and cool with a great attitude and a load of brains. The ending is silly, not for how it is done, but for why I heard what they did as it shows how silly they might be in making sure something doesn't happen. Well this is surely a great film and should have been nominated and won in the 1968 Oscars for best picture.

    Paul Newman made many excellent movies, among them are The Hustler, Hud, The Verdict, The Sting, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, and this very film, Cool Hand Luke. Cool Hand Luke is by all means an excellent picture, and it's a great movie about a man who refuses to reform to life in prison. This is one of the best movies that I've ever seen, it's one of the best movies of 1967, and it's one of the best movies of the 1960's as a whole. In this movie, Paul Newman plays Lucas Jackson, a man who on one drunken night, gets arrested for cutting the heads off a town's parking meters, and he's sent to prison to conform, but instead of giving in to their demands, he holds his ground and finds ways to escape his prison life. Paul Newman was outstanding, this is one of (if not the best) the best movies that he's ever made. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, but he lost to Rod Steiger for his performance in In The Heat Of The Night, that's stiff competition, as both performances were outstanding, and as a matter of fact, it's really hard to decide which one did a better job. As I said in the previous paragraph, Paul Newman is fabulous, and so are the other cast members. George Kennedy gives a performance that's equal in greatness to Newman's as Dragline, a fellow prisoner who becomes friends with Lucas Jackson. On Oscar night, Kennedy walked away with the award for Best Supporting Actor, a win that he rightfully deserved. Strother Martin was great as the ruthless Captain, who says one of the most famous lines from any movie in all of movie history: "What we've got here is failure to communicate." And although he's the silent type, Morgan Woodward is menacing as "the man with no eyes" Boss Godfrey. Everybody in the movie was wonderful, but the performances from Paul Newman and George Kennedy were the best. Paul Newman (may he rest in peace) was a sensation, and there is no doubt that his talent will be missed. I know that I will certainly miss him, as he was in quite a few movies that are among some of the best I've ever seen. Cool Hand Luke is a movie that is definite required viewing, you will see Paul Newman like you've never seen him before, and as a matter of fact, you will probably never think of him in the same way again after you watch this film, as here, he is in a class all by himself. So all in all, you have definitely got to see this remarkable film, as not only is it a great movie starring Paul Newman, it's a great movie as a whole! In fact, this movie is so good, that you will most likely end up watching it multiple times because of the sheer greatness in it. I was surprised when I watched it. Beforehand, I was expecting to see a movie with great acting and storytelling, but when I watched it, I got more, I got a movie with fabulous acting and storytelling. Want to see an excellent Paul Newman film, then watch Cool Hand Luke, as it's excellent, or even better, it's more than excellent, it's a marvel for the film industry, and a timeless and unforgettable classic. 10/10

    Watching this movie was a massive letdown for me. It was supposed to be a gem of American cinematography -- instead, what we've got here is a failure to enjoy even a few minutes of it. I'm sorry, but the direction seemed particularly weak to me -- and only afterwards, I learned that this was Stuart Rosenberg's directorial debut. Oh heavens, but it showed! It took me literally four attempts to get through this turgid movie; it couldn't possibly be moving slower; there is no clear narrative line -- only disjointed episodes, and once you've seen the first 5 of them, you know that the remaining two dozen or so will be just more of the same. This movie is affectation from start to finish. Sorry, I did not see it as realistic -- rather, as a movie *playing a game* called "Let's be brutally realistic." But that's exactly what's wrong: you can see, the whole time, that this is just a movie *affecting* realism. The actors appearing here, led by the super-handsome Paul Newman, are *not* real prisoners. Sorry, but they're just too clean-cut, their hairstyles are more admirable than this reviewer's hairstyle has ever been... and when Paul Newman is supposed to look disheveled, you can see that it's just make-up artists at work. Imagine an ugly actor playing the part of Luke -- would this movie have been such a huge hit? I'm certain it wouldn't; Newman carries the movie on his shoulders, with his boyish charm, yet he is just as affected as everyone else. The most annoying character, to me, was the one played by George Kennedy. Sorry, I couldn't picture Kennedy as a real prisoner for a single minute. He was an *actor* playing a prisoner -- that's all. I just didn't buy his portrayal and couldn't buy it, no matter how much I strove to suspend my disbelief. Awarding an Oscar for such a histrionic performance is something I can't possibly fathom -- perhaps, as sometimes happens with Oscars, it was awarded to Kennedy as a summary appreciation for all of his work in all his other previous movies. There is no doubt that _Cool Hand Luke_ features lots of great actors -- so the blame for the movie's failure to impress must be assigned to the director. It's primarily the director's job to ensure that actors don't fall into that trap of appearing to be just theatrical actors, not real persons. Don't get me wrong: it wasn't the movie's unsavory milieu that put me off. Although I'm no fan of prison movies, I have great regard for a true classic like _The Shawshank Redemption_; I also quite enjoyed Stanley Kramer's similarly themed (prison escape) _The Defiant Ones_, or _The Green Mile_ with Tom Hanks. But no matter how much I tried, and how much I appreciate Paul Newman as an actor, I just couldn't enjoy _Cool Hand Luke_ one bit. Oh yes, _Cool Hand Luke_ features a classic quotation about the failure to communicate -- but one such catchphrase is not enough to rescue such a monumental bore of 2 hours' length. If one wished to be sarcastic, one might say the catchphrase is so good because, as the screenwriter admitted, it appeared "subconsciously" in his mind as he was writing the script -- without him intending to use the phrase at all. Seeing as those things that the movie's creators apparently *did* intend to accomplish, didn't pan out, it's probably good he did not intend to create a classic catchphrase -- because that conscious intention would probably have misfired like the rest of the movie.

    - A With one the best performances I've ever seen with Paul Newman, Cool Hand Luke is one of the most fun movies ever as its about a man who gets arrested and treats his time locked away with joy, humor, and friendship. The film is brilliantly written and told as the dialog is fun and serious at times. The events done from future friends having a fist fight, to Luke eating a crap load of eggs. The escape scenes are fun as they are clever and fun to watch others take part. Luke is chill, and cool with a great attitude and a load of brains. The ending is silly, not for how it is done, but for why I heard what they did as it shows how silly they might be in making sure something doesn't happen. Well this is surely a great film and should have been nominated and won in the 1968 Oscars for best picture.

    Paul Newman made many excellent movies, among them are The Hustler, Hud, The Verdict, The Sting, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, and this very film, Cool Hand Luke. Cool Hand Luke is by all means an excellent picture, and it's a great movie about a man who refuses to reform to life in prison. This is one of the best movies that I've ever seen, it's one of the best movies of 1967, and it's one of the best movies of the 1960's as a whole. In this movie, Paul Newman plays Lucas Jackson, a man who on one drunken night, gets arrested for cutting the heads off a town's parking meters, and he's sent to prison to conform, but instead of giving in to their demands, he holds his ground and finds ways to escape his prison life. Paul Newman was outstanding, this is one of (if not the best) the best movies that he's ever made. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, but he lost to Rod Steiger for his performance in In The Heat Of The Night, that's stiff competition, as both performances were outstanding, and as a matter of fact, it's really hard to decide which one did a better job. As I said in the previous paragraph, Paul Newman is fabulous, and so are the other cast members. George Kennedy gives a performance that's equal in greatness to Newman's as Dragline, a fellow prisoner who becomes friends with Lucas Jackson. On Oscar night, Kennedy walked away with the award for Best Supporting Actor, a win that he rightfully deserved. Strother Martin was great as the ruthless Captain, who says one of the most famous lines from any movie in all of movie history: "What we've got here is failure to communicate." And although he's the silent type, Morgan Woodward is menacing as "the man with no eyes" Boss Godfrey. Everybody in the movie was wonderful, but the performances from Paul Newman and George Kennedy were the best. Paul Newman (may he rest in peace) was a sensation, and there is no doubt that his talent will be missed. I know that I will certainly miss him, as he was in quite a few movies that are among some of the best I've ever seen. Cool Hand Luke is a movie that is definite required viewing, you will see Paul Newman like you've never seen him before, and as a matter of fact, you will probably never think of him in the same way again after you watch this film, as here, he is in a class all by himself. So all in all, you have definitely got to see this remarkable film, as not only is it a great movie starring Paul Newman, it's a great movie as a whole! In fact, this movie is so good, that you will most likely end up watching it multiple times because of the sheer greatness in it. I was surprised when I watched it. Beforehand, I was expecting to see a movie with great acting and storytelling, but when I watched it, I got more, I got a movie with fabulous acting and storytelling. Want to see an excellent Paul Newman film, then watch Cool Hand Luke, as it's excellent, or even better, it's more than excellent, it's a marvel for the film industry, and a timeless and unforgettable classic. 10/10

    Watching this movie was a massive letdown for me. It was supposed to be a gem of American cinematography -- instead, what we've got here is a failure to enjoy even a few minutes of it. I'm sorry, but the direction seemed particularly weak to me -- and only afterwards, I learned that this was Stuart Rosenberg's directorial debut. Oh heavens, but it showed! It took me literally four attempts to get through this turgid movie; it couldn't possibly be moving slower; there is no clear narrative line -- only disjointed episodes, and once you've seen the first 5 of them, you know that the remaining two dozen or so will be just more of the same. This movie is affectation from start to finish. Sorry, I did not see it as realistic -- rather, as a movie *playing a game* called "Let's be brutally realistic." But that's exactly what's wrong: you can see, the whole time, that this is just a movie *affecting* realism. The actors appearing here, led by the super-handsome Paul Newman, are *not* real prisoners. Sorry, but they're just too clean-cut, their hairstyles are more admirable than this reviewer's hairstyle has ever been... and when Paul Newman is supposed to look disheveled, you can see that it's just make-up artists at work. Imagine an ugly actor playing the part of Luke -- would this movie have been such a huge hit? I'm certain it wouldn't; Newman carries the movie on his shoulders, with his boyish charm, yet he is just as affected as everyone else. The most annoying character, to me, was the one played by George Kennedy. Sorry, I couldn't picture Kennedy as a real prisoner for a single minute. He was an *actor* playing a prisoner -- that's all. I just didn't buy his portrayal and couldn't buy it, no matter how much I strove to suspend my disbelief. Awarding an Oscar for such a histrionic performance is something I can't possibly fathom -- perhaps, as sometimes happens with Oscars, it was awarded to Kennedy as a summary appreciation for all of his work in all his other previous movies. There is no doubt that _Cool Hand Luke_ features lots of great actors -- so the blame for the movie's failure to impress must be assigned to the director. It's primarily the director's job to ensure that actors don't fall into that trap of appearing to be just theatrical actors, not real persons. Don't get me wrong: it wasn't the movie's unsavory milieu that put me off. Although I'm no fan of prison movies, I have great regard for a true classic like _The Shawshank Redemption_; I also quite enjoyed Stanley Kramer's similarly themed (prison escape) _The Defiant Ones_, or _The Green Mile_ with Tom Hanks. But no matter how much I tried, and how much I appreciate Paul Newman as an actor, I just couldn't enjoy _Cool Hand Luke_ one bit. Oh yes, _Cool Hand Luke_ features a classic quotation about the failure to communicate -- but one such catchphrase is not enough to rescue such a monumental bore of 2 hours' length. If one wished to be sarcastic, one might say the catchphrase is so good because, as the screenwriter admitted, it appeared "subconsciously" in his mind as he was writing the script -- without him intending to use the phrase at all. Seeing as those things that the movie's creators apparently *did* intend to accomplish, didn't pan out, it's probably good he did not intend to create a classic catchphrase -- because that conscious intention would probably have misfired like the rest of the movie.

    Cool Hand Luke is one of those films. You know, one of those which everybody loves and calls the greatest films ever made but you just don't seem to enjoy that much. I don't think it's bad or even mediocre, but Cool Hand Luke just wasn't that entertaining. I should mention first the thing that made a good impression on me. Paul Newman gives a really great performance. Without him, Cool Hand Luke would have fallen apart for me. His screen presence and charisma carried the more boring and uninteresting parts of the film. Also the story was really good. Sadly it was watered down by the era it came out. If it was made in the 70's or any other era, Cool Hand Luke would have been much more effective and memorable. And here we come to the first problem. First off, I don't particularly like whimsical pre-seventies prison films. I tend to like more the exploitative sub-genres of prison films like Female Prisoner Scorpion over the "classier" stuff. In other words, Cool Hand Luke is too tame for my taste and lacks a real punch to the gut feeling the 70's films offer. Another element that doesn't work for me is the rest of the cast. I did like Harry Dean Stanton in the film, the rest of the cast were just boring and lacking anything memorable about them. Most of the just acted like mentally handicapped people instead of acting like convicted criminals or real people. And last element that didn't work was the direction. Cool Hand Luke needed a more inventive camera work and visuals. The overall direction was bland and lacked any spark of creativity. Bust despite it's flaws, Cool Hand Luke is an entertaining film. It was never boring or dragged. The pacing was excellent and Paul Newman kept me involved. Sadly my love of the more cynical and exploitative Meiko Kaji films kept me from loving it. Cool Hand Luke is a must see for anyone who is a big fan of Paul Newman. It's probably one of his most recognizable performances with The Hustler, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting. If you happen to enjoy smart prison films over sleaze, boobs and Meiko Kaji then this is your kind of film. But as for me, I'll stick to my sleaze instead.

    Cool Hand Luke is a film about a man who is sent to a rural prison for taking off the heads of parking meters. At the prison, he becomes part of the chain gang dealing with hot, back-breaking road work. As this man lives in prison, he becomes the short-talking, cool inmate that can either get under your skin or become your best friend. Of course as time goes by, his cool personality gets him into trouble by constantly breaking out of prison and being put back in. At the end of the film once you this his "cool" mind is put to rest, he breaks out of prison again to see what the Almighty has left for him to live for; and that is nothing can get you a pretty cool hand. This is a well-made film although it does have some minor flaws including over-dramaticism and unrealistic situations. Cool Hand Luke is a decent prison film but it surely is no Shawshank. But watch this movie and receive some sentimental, witty laughs.

    From the great mood the music sets for the movie, to classic one-liners "What we have here is a failure to communicate.", to the excellent acting, this movie is a classic. This movie will never get old. Classic scenes like the convicts squirming while watching the car getting watched, to everyone's favorite (and mine)...the egg-eating contest, to the iconic way they ask for permission: "Getting water, Boss!" "Taking my shirt off, Boss." Hopefully, Hollywood never ruins this movie by attempting to remake it, as seems to be the case during this era of movie-making. It was done exactly right the first time, and I hope it stays that way. Dim the lights, grab some popcorn, and enjoy this movie again; for those that have never seen it, a special treat is in store for you. Enjoy!

    I was not aware of this movie until recently, and i watched it by accident on TV. I was astonished, period. Great scenario, great acting,great direction, what more to say! Paul Newman is at his best, and so is George Kennedy! Dennis Hopper holds a small part but is quite good. The movie captures you from the first minute till the last. And you are easily attached with the characters. i really want to describe many scenes that i consider magnificent, but i respect the no spoiler rule, so i would just say that the scene with the eggs is more than hilarious!! Overall, i highly recommend it obviously! For your info, unlike what others might say, this is not so much like the Great Escape. It is far more emotional and less funny!

    For anyone having missed this tour de force by Newman, what a TREAT to recommend. There's enough symbolism, strength & edge to make this movie last a lifetime. It never grows old. The egg swallowing scene is up there with "are you talking to me" in Taxi-drive or other legendary movie. And GOD is Paul easy on the eyes. Of all the amaaazing films he compiled in his tremendous film career, to me, this is his finest accomplishment. And the character actors surrounding him only benefit & heighten its measure along the way. One not to be left out of any film aficiando's portfolio! And for those critics out there claiming it's OUTdated & not relevant, I say, don't be so quick to judge, slow down & drink this one in & THINK about the messages involved here.

    'Cool Hand Luke' is the (long) story of a charismatic misfit in a Southern segregated convict road gang. There is an interesting turning point in the film where Luke (Paul Newman) refuses to shelter from a deadly(?) rainstorm with the rest of the gang, and defies God to do anything to him; his character is defined by this sort of bravado. In the next scene, he learns that his beloved mother has died and the famous 'Plastic Jesus' song scene follows. Luke then simply becomes reckless and hurtles towards his doom. The problem with the film is that this interesting pivotal moment - his mother's death and how Luke might feel he had provoked God - is all but obliterated in the corny dramatisation of the convicts' lives. Clich&eacute;s abound; apart from the effective depiction of the back-breaking work of the gang, the compound seems to be more like a frat house. Perfect hairstyles, no fights except on Saturdays, plenty of food and booze, and basically everybody manages to keep their chins up, play poker and have a good laugh most of the time. Other reviewers have cited the 'Hogan's Heroes' and 'Bilko' similarities. They're right. So what could be a really affecting story just turns out to be a series of upbeat and downbeat setpieces, with a 'modern' nihilistic ending. Actually, there's a completely irrelevant bit tacked on after that where George Kennedy tells the gang what a 'world-shaker' Luke was. No he wasn't, he was possibly a complicated character but we learn nothing about what he really feels or why he did what he did. Whether that's Paul Newman's or the script's fault I can't tell, but Paul Newman does his overblown 'Hustler' performance, chewing more scenery than eggs in the process. A curate's egg, even - a few parts of this bad egg are excellent.

    This is one of those films I managed to not see for decades. When I finally saw it recently, I was left at quite a loss. What is it that draws people to watch bored characters make themselves into losers for no good reason? In Cool Hand Luke, the main character, Luke, played by Paul Newman, ends up in prison for a short sentence he earned by destroying public property (parking meters). For anyone with any shred of common sense, serving the short sentence would be enough. Get in, get out, lesson learned. But, to make the story interesting, Luke manages to create friction where there was none, for no good reason other than tendency to self-destruct. He is not an anti-conformist, not very smart, and not really having much of a goal. He is healthy, and perfectly capable of earning a living. But he decides to go down in flames, albeit with questionable style. I found it torturing to watch dumb character doing dumb things. In few instances we see Luke trying to talk to God, but the "conversation" is lacking, uninspiring and pointless. Those moments make Luke sound like a spoiled, self-absorbed, angry teen. Perhaps the book's author and filmmakers would like to believe that Cool Hand Luke is a story about someone who was wronged, or searching for God, or inspiring others to be different, but it is none of those. This film falls flat on its face in all departments, and earns only high marks for its shallowness and decent performances. For a truly great story about anti-conformism, one should watch One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest. Cool Hand Luke is nowhere near that. All in all, this depressing, pointless story is the best way to ruin your evening. I gave it 2 stars only for Paul Newman's performance, otherwise, it would be a firm zero.

    I was not aware of this movie until recently, and i watched it by accident on TV. I was astonished, period. Great scenario, great acting,great direction, what more to say! Paul Newman is at his best, and so is George Kennedy! Dennis Hopper holds a small part but is quite good. The movie captures you from the first minute till the last. And you are easily attached with the characters. i really want to describe many scenes that i consider magnificent, but i respect the no spoiler rule, so i would just say that the scene with the eggs is more than hilarious!! Overall, i highly recommend it obviously! For your info, unlike what others might say, this is not so much like the Great Escape. It is far more emotional and less funny!

    For anyone having missed this tour de force by Newman, what a TREAT to recommend. There's enough symbolism, strength & edge to make this movie last a lifetime. It never grows old. The egg swallowing scene is up there with "are you talking to me" in Taxi-drive or other legendary movie. And GOD is Paul easy on the eyes. Of all the amaaazing films he compiled in his tremendous film career, to me, this is his finest accomplishment. And the character actors surrounding him only benefit & heighten its measure along the way. One not to be left out of any film aficiando's portfolio! And for those critics out there claiming it's OUTdated & not relevant, I say, don't be so quick to judge, slow down & drink this one in & THINK about the messages involved here.

    'Cool Hand Luke' is the (long) story of a charismatic misfit in a Southern segregated convict road gang. There is an interesting turning point in the film where Luke (Paul Newman) refuses to shelter from a deadly(?) rainstorm with the rest of the gang, and defies God to do anything to him; his character is defined by this sort of bravado. In the next scene, he learns that his beloved mother has died and the famous 'Plastic Jesus' song scene follows. Luke then simply becomes reckless and hurtles towards his doom. The problem with the film is that this interesting pivotal moment - his mother's death and how Luke might feel he had provoked God - is all but obliterated in the corny dramatisation of the convicts' lives. Clich&eacute;s abound; apart from the effective depiction of the back-breaking work of the gang, the compound seems to be more like a frat house. Perfect hairstyles, no fights except on Saturdays, plenty of food and booze, and basically everybody manages to keep their chins up, play poker and have a good laugh most of the time. Other reviewers have cited the 'Hogan's Heroes' and 'Bilko' similarities. They're right. So what could be a really affecting story just turns out to be a series of upbeat and downbeat setpieces, with a 'modern' nihilistic ending. Actually, there's a completely irrelevant bit tacked on after that where George Kennedy tells the gang what a 'world-shaker' Luke was. No he wasn't, he was possibly a complicated character but we learn nothing about what he really feels or why he did what he did. Whether that's Paul Newman's or the script's fault I can't tell, but Paul Newman does his overblown 'Hustler' performance, chewing more scenery than eggs in the process. A curate's egg, even - a few parts of this bad egg are excellent.

    This is one of those films I managed to not see for decades. When I finally saw it recently, I was left at quite a loss. What is it that draws people to watch bored characters make themselves into losers for no good reason? In Cool Hand Luke, the main character, Luke, played by Paul Newman, ends up in prison for a short sentence he earned by destroying public property (parking meters). For anyone with any shred of common sense, serving the short sentence would be enough. Get in, get out, lesson learned. But, to make the story interesting, Luke manages to create friction where there was none, for no good reason other than tendency to self-destruct. He is not an anti-conformist, not very smart, and not really having much of a goal. He is healthy, and perfectly capable of earning a living. But he decides to go down in flames, albeit with questionable style. I found it torturing to watch dumb character doing dumb things. In few instances we see Luke trying to talk to God, but the "conversation" is lacking, uninspiring and pointless. Those moments make Luke sound like a spoiled, self-absorbed, angry teen. Perhaps the book's author and filmmakers would like to believe that Cool Hand Luke is a story about someone who was wronged, or searching for God, or inspiring others to be different, but it is none of those. This film falls flat on its face in all departments, and earns only high marks for its shallowness and decent performances. For a truly great story about anti-conformism, one should watch One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest. Cool Hand Luke is nowhere near that. All in all, this depressing, pointless story is the best way to ruin your evening. I gave it 2 stars only for Paul Newman's performance, otherwise, it would be a firm zero.

    - A With one the best performances I've ever seen with Paul Newman, Cool Hand Luke is one of the most fun movies ever as its about a man who gets arrested and treats his time locked away with joy, humor, and friendship. The film is brilliantly written and told as the dialog is fun and serious at times. The events done from future friends having a fist fight, to Luke eating a crap load of eggs. The escape scenes are fun as they are clever and fun to watch others take part. Luke is chill, and cool with a great attitude and a load of brains. The ending is silly, not for how it is done, but for why I heard what they did as it shows how silly they might be in making sure something doesn't happen. Well this is surely a great film and should have been nominated and won in the 1968 Oscars for best picture.

    Paul Newman made many excellent movies, among them are The Hustler, Hud, The Verdict, The Sting, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, and this very film, Cool Hand Luke. Cool Hand Luke is by all means an excellent picture, and it's a great movie about a man who refuses to reform to life in prison. This is one of the best movies that I've ever seen, it's one of the best movies of 1967, and it's one of the best movies of the 1960's as a whole. In this movie, Paul Newman plays Lucas Jackson, a man who on one drunken night, gets arrested for cutting the heads off a town's parking meters, and he's sent to prison to conform, but instead of giving in to their demands, he holds his ground and finds ways to escape his prison life. Paul Newman was outstanding, this is one of (if not the best) the best movies that he's ever made. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, but he lost to Rod Steiger for his performance in In The Heat Of The Night, that's stiff competition, as both performances were outstanding, and as a matter of fact, it's really hard to decide which one did a better job. As I said in the previous paragraph, Paul Newman is fabulous, and so are the other cast members. George Kennedy gives a performance that's equal in greatness to Newman's as Dragline, a fellow prisoner who becomes friends with Lucas Jackson. On Oscar night, Kennedy walked away with the award for Best Supporting Actor, a win that he rightfully deserved. Strother Martin was great as the ruthless Captain, who says one of the most famous lines from any movie in all of movie history: "What we've got here is failure to communicate." And although he's the silent type, Morgan Woodward is menacing as "the man with no eyes" Boss Godfrey. Everybody in the movie was wonderful, but the performances from Paul Newman and George Kennedy were the best. Paul Newman (may he rest in peace) was a sensation, and there is no doubt that his talent will be missed. I know that I will certainly miss him, as he was in quite a few movies that are among some of the best I've ever seen. Cool Hand Luke is a movie that is definite required viewing, you will see Paul Newman like you've never seen him before, and as a matter of fact, you will probably never think of him in the same way again after you watch this film, as here, he is in a class all by himself. So all in all, you have definitely got to see this remarkable film, as not only is it a great movie starring Paul Newman, it's a great movie as a whole! In fact, this movie is so good, that you will most likely end up watching it multiple times because of the sheer greatness in it. I was surprised when I watched it. Beforehand, I was expecting to see a movie with great acting and storytelling, but when I watched it, I got more, I got a movie with fabulous acting and storytelling. Want to see an excellent Paul Newman film, then watch Cool Hand Luke, as it's excellent, or even better, it's more than excellent, it's a marvel for the film industry, and a timeless and unforgettable classic. 10/10

    Watching this movie was a massive letdown for me. It was supposed to be a gem of American cinematography -- instead, what we've got here is a failure to enjoy even a few minutes of it. I'm sorry, but the direction seemed particularly weak to me -- and only afterwards, I learned that this was Stuart Rosenberg's directorial debut. Oh heavens, but it showed! It took me literally four attempts to get through this turgid movie; it couldn't possibly be moving slower; there is no clear narrative line -- only disjointed episodes, and once you've seen the first 5 of them, you know that the remaining two dozen or so will be just more of the same. This movie is affectation from start to finish. Sorry, I did not see it as realistic -- rather, as a movie *playing a game* called "Let's be brutally realistic." But that's exactly what's wrong: you can see, the whole time, that this is just a movie *affecting* realism. The actors appearing here, led by the super-handsome Paul Newman, are *not* real prisoners. Sorry, but they're just too clean-cut, their hairstyles are more admirable than this reviewer's hairstyle has ever been... and when Paul Newman is supposed to look disheveled, you can see that it's just make-up artists at work. Imagine an ugly actor playing the part of Luke -- would this movie have been such a huge hit? I'm certain it wouldn't; Newman carries the movie on his shoulders, with his boyish charm, yet he is just as affected as everyone else. The most annoying character, to me, was the one played by George Kennedy. Sorry, I couldn't picture Kennedy as a real prisoner for a single minute. He was an *actor* playing a prisoner -- that's all. I just didn't buy his portrayal and couldn't buy it, no matter how much I strove to suspend my disbelief. Awarding an Oscar for such a histrionic performance is something I can't possibly fathom -- perhaps, as sometimes happens with Oscars, it was awarded to Kennedy as a summary appreciation for all of his work in all his other previous movies. There is no doubt that _Cool Hand Luke_ features lots of great actors -- so the blame for the movie's failure to impress must be assigned to the director. It's primarily the director's job to ensure that actors don't fall into that trap of appearing to be just theatrical actors, not real persons. Don't get me wrong: it wasn't the movie's unsavory milieu that put me off. Although I'm no fan of prison movies, I have great regard for a true classic like _The Shawshank Redemption_; I also quite enjoyed Stanley Kramer's similarly themed (prison escape) _The Defiant Ones_, or _The Green Mile_ with Tom Hanks. But no matter how much I tried, and how much I appreciate Paul Newman as an actor, I just couldn't enjoy _Cool Hand Luke_ one bit. Oh yes, _Cool Hand Luke_ features a classic quotation about the failure to communicate -- but one such catchphrase is not enough to rescue such a monumental bore of 2 hours' length. If one wished to be sarcastic, one might say the catchphrase is so good because, as the screenwriter admitted, it appeared "subconsciously" in his mind as he was writing the script -- without him intending to use the phrase at all. Seeing as those things that the movie's creators apparently *did* intend to accomplish, didn't pan out, it's probably good he did not intend to create a classic catchphrase -- because that conscious intention would probably have misfired like the rest of the movie.

    Cool Hand Luke is one of those films. You know, one of those which everybody loves and calls the greatest films ever made but you just don't seem to enjoy that much. I don't think it's bad or even mediocre, but Cool Hand Luke just wasn't that entertaining. I should mention first the thing that made a good impression on me. Paul Newman gives a really great performance. Without him, Cool Hand Luke would have fallen apart for me. His screen presence and charisma carried the more boring and uninteresting parts of the film. Also the story was really good. Sadly it was watered down by the era it came out. If it was made in the 70's or any other era, Cool Hand Luke would have been much more effective and memorable. And here we come to the first problem. First off, I don't particularly like whimsical pre-seventies prison films. I tend to like more the exploitative sub-genres of prison films like Female Prisoner Scorpion over the "classier" stuff. In other words, Cool Hand Luke is too tame for my taste and lacks a real punch to the gut feeling the 70's films offer. Another element that doesn't work for me is the rest of the cast. I did like Harry Dean Stanton in the film, the rest of the cast were just boring and lacking anything memorable about them. Most of the just acted like mentally handicapped people instead of acting like convicted criminals or real people. And last element that didn't work was the direction. Cool Hand Luke needed a more inventive camera work and visuals. The overall direction was bland and lacked any spark of creativity. Bust despite it's flaws, Cool Hand Luke is an entertaining film. It was never boring or dragged. The pacing was excellent and Paul Newman kept me involved. Sadly my love of the more cynical and exploitative Meiko Kaji films kept me from loving it. Cool Hand Luke is a must see for anyone who is a big fan of Paul Newman. It's probably one of his most recognizable performances with The Hustler, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting. If you happen to enjoy smart prison films over sleaze, boobs and Meiko Kaji then this is your kind of film. But as for me, I'll stick to my sleaze instead.

    Cool Hand Luke is a film about a man who is sent to a rural prison for taking off the heads of parking meters. At the prison, he becomes part of the chain gang dealing with hot, back-breaking road work. As this man lives in prison, he becomes the short-talking, cool inmate that can either get under your skin or become your best friend. Of course as time goes by, his cool personality gets him into trouble by constantly breaking out of prison and being put back in. At the end of the film once you this his "cool" mind is put to rest, he breaks out of prison again to see what the Almighty has left for him to live for; and that is nothing can get you a pretty cool hand. This is a well-made film although it does have some minor flaws including over-dramaticism and unrealistic situations. Cool Hand Luke is a decent prison film but it surely is no Shawshank. But watch this movie and receive some sentimental, witty laughs.

    From the great mood the music sets for the movie, to classic one-liners "What we have here is a failure to communicate.", to the excellent acting, this movie is a classic. This movie will never get old. Classic scenes like the convicts squirming while watching the car getting watched, to everyone's favorite (and mine)...the egg-eating contest, to the iconic way they ask for permission: "Getting water, Boss!" "Taking my shirt off, Boss." Hopefully, Hollywood never ruins this movie by attempting to remake it, as seems to be the case during this era of movie-making. It was done exactly right the first time, and I hope it stays that way. Dim the lights, grab some popcorn, and enjoy this movie again; for those that have never seen it, a special treat is in store for you. Enjoy!

Cool Hand Luke is by all means an excellent picture, and it's a great movie about a man who refuses to reform to life in prison.

The most annoying character, to me, was the one played by George Kennedy. Sorry, I couldn't picture Kennedy as a real prisoner for a single minute. He was an *actor* playing a prisoner -- that's all. I just didn't buy his portrayal and couldn't buy it, no matter how much I strove to suspend my disbelief. Awarding an Oscar for such a histrionic performance is something I can't possibly fathom -- perhaps, as sometimes happens with Oscars, it was awarded to Kennedy as a summary appreciation for all of his work in all his other previous movies. There is no doubt that _Cool Hand Luke_ features lots of great actors -- so the blame for the movie's failure to impress must be assigned to the director. It's primarily the director's job to ensure that actors don't fall into that trap of appearing to be just theatrical actors, not real persons. Don't get me wrong: it wasn't the movie's unsavory milieu that put me off. Although I'm no fan of prison movies, I have great regard for a true classic like _The Shawshank Redemption_; I also quite enjoyed Stanley Kramer's similarly themed (prison escape) _The Defiant Ones_, or _The Green Mile_ with Tom Hanks. But no matter how much I tried, and how much I appreciate Paul Newman as an actor, I just couldn't enjoy _Cool Hand Luke_ one bit. Oh yes, _Cool Hand Luke_ features a classic quotation about the failure to communicate -- but one such catchphrase is not enough to rescue such a monumental bore of 2 hours' length. If one wished to be sarcastic, one might say the catchphrase is so good because, as the screenwriter admitted, it appeared "subconsciously" in his mind as he was writing the script -- without him intending to use the phrase at all. Seeing as those things that the movie's creators apparently *did* intend to accomplish, didn't pan out, it's probably good he did not intend to create a classic catchphrase -- because that conscious intention would probably have misfired like the rest of the movie.

    Cool Hand Luke is one of those films. You know, one of those which everybody loves and calls the greatest films ever made but you just don't seem to enjoy that much. I don't think it's bad or even mediocre, but Cool Hand Luke just wasn't that entertaining. I should mention first the thing that made a good impression on me. Paul Newman gives a really great performance. Without him, Cool Hand Luke would have fallen apart for me. His screen presence and charisma carried the more boring and uninteresting parts of the film. Also the story was really good. Sadly it was watered down by the era it came out. If it was made in the 70's or any other era, Cool Hand Luke would have been much more effective and memorable. And here we come to the first problem. First off, I don't particularly like whimsical pre-seventies prison films. I tend to like more the exploitative sub-genres of prison films like Female Prisoner Scorpion over the "classier" stuff. In other words, Cool Hand Luke is too tame for my taste and lacks a real punch to the gut feeling the 70's films offer. Another element that doesn't work for me is the rest of the cast. I did like Harry Dean Stanton in the film, the rest of the cast were just boring and lacking anything memorable about them. Most of the just acted like mentally handicapped people instead of acting like convicted criminals or real people. And last element that didn't work was the direction. Cool Hand Luke needed a more inventive camera work and visuals. The overall direction was bland and lacked any spark of creativity. Bust despite it's flaws, Cool Hand Luke is an entertaining film. It was never boring or dragged. The pacing was excellent and Paul Newman kept me involved. Sadly my love of the more cynical and exploitative Meiko Kaji films kept me from loving it. Cool Hand Luke is a must see for anyone who is a big fan of Paul Newman. It's probably one of his most recognizable performances with The Hustler, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting. If you happen to enjoy smart prison films over sleaze, boobs and Meiko Kaji then this is your kind of film. But as for me, I'll stick to my sleaze instead.
