    Natalie Wood, and Gene Tierney give wonderful performances in a classic haunting tale,, a woman writer moves into a haunted house by the sea to get some well needed rest and peace and quiet,, apparently the house is haunted by a ship's captain.. he tries to drive her out at first as he has gotten used to the peace and quiet,, but she is spunky and won't go quietly. the two seem to get along with each other after a while and so they agree on a truce of sorts. later on her finances are dwindling and she needs to raise money , so the captain agrees to let her write his autobiography.. , there is also a man in the picture a live one who wants the young lady and now has to contend with the ghost,, I thought this was a very good movie,, I didn't need any action,, didn't need that many scares either,, I think there were a few,, but overall I enjoyed the picture very well,, as it was told well, and the story had good pacing and moved along quickly so you the viewer were never bored.

    This is a rewarding genre spanning film that combines elements of mystery, drama, humor, and romance in a uniquely compelling way. Gene Tierney is simply gorgeous in the title role of Mrs. Muir, while Rex Harrison's bombast as the ghostly sea captain mellows over time to engage his house guest as a worthy companion and suitor. It's intriguing that the story never goes in the direction of creating some sort of sexual tension between the principals. It's all believably platonic, with the interjection of a suitable cad (George Sanders) to woo Mrs. Muir in a relationship destined for failure. Depending on your approach, the film can be interpreted on many levels. Was Mrs. Muir's ghost a figment of her imagination, a dream, or some other unexplained phenomenon? One's own interpretation may change upon subsequent viewings. I've seen this picture a couple of times and found it to be a rewarding film with rich dialog, crisp photography and a wonderful Bernard Herrmann score to capture the ethereal mood.

    "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" is a supernatural fantasy film of a type which was popular in the forties; other American examples include "I Married a Witch", "Heaven Can Wait" (which also starred Gene Tierney), "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Portrait of Jennie". There were also British equivalents such as "Blithe Spirit" (which also starred Rex Harrison), "A Matter of Life and Death" and "Pandora and the Flying Dutchman" (this latter being from the early fifties). The film can, alternatively, be though of as a romantic comedy. Most rom-coms deal with the story of how a couple overcome an obstacle to their love, and in this case the obstacle seems a formidable one indeed- one of them is alive, the other dead. Although the film was shot entirely in California, it is set in Edwardian England. Lucy Muir, a beautiful young widow, moves into a seaside cottage with her young daughter Anna and her maid Martha. She discovers that the house is haunted by the ghost of its former owner, a sea captain named Daniel Gregg. Daniel initially seems like a difficult, testy character, but he soon shows that he has a decent, kindly side to his nature. When Lucy gets into financial difficulties he saves the day by dictating to her his memoirs of his seafaring life and allowing her to publish them and collect the royalties; when the book becomes a bestseller, Lucy becomes a wealthy woman. Lucy and the ghostly Daniel fall in love, but realise that theirs is a hopeless situation, and Lucy forms an attachment to Miles Fairley, a writer of children's stories. There were a number of contenders for the title of "most beautiful film star of the forties" (Ava Gardner, Jennifer Jones, Ingrid Bergman, Rita Hayworth, Lana Turner, Veronica Lake and others), but had I been a judge in a hypothetical "Miss Hollywood" contest, my vote would have gone to Gene Tierney. Although her British accent is not always spot-on, the lovely Gene makes an absolutely adorable heroine here. Rex Harrison (generally at his best in comedy, although he could also be good in serious films like "The Agony and the Ecstasy") gives a good performance as the salty old seadog Daniel, playing him as a likable rogue. George Sanders was always a good villain, and here plays Miles as a suave but oily charmer; it comes as no surprise when (like a number of characters played by Sanders) he turns out to be an utter cad. There is also a good contribution from Edna Best as Martha; the young Anna is played by an eight-year-old Natalie Wood. (Like Elizabeth Taylor, Natalie was to become so famous as an adult that one forgets she started her career as a child star). I would not rate "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" quite as highly as films like "It's a Wonderful Life" or "A Matter of Life and Death", both of which have a greater depth and rank among the best films of the forties, but it is nevertheless a very enjoyable light fantasies. And, as in all the best rom-coms, there is eventually to be a happy ending of sorts. 7/10

    A classic, by definition, is something that cannot be improved, and one could hardly wring more old time charm out of a picture than this one does. Rex Harrison is great as the ghost of a cantankerous sea captain who haunts the seaside house of widow Gene Tierney. He makes an unlikely but compelling romantic figure and soon the mismatched couple fall in love despite the obvious handicap that Harrison is already dead. This is Old School Hollywood 200 proof moonshine to be sure - the production design and costumes seem quite posh for a young widow of supposedly limited means - but everything is so carefully contrived to manipulate the audience to rally emotionally around the unlikely twosome that a little extra prettying up just makes for an even more watchable experience.

    It's the turn of the century. Gene Tierney is the beautiful widow, Mrs. Muir. More or less thrown out by her priggish older sisters she moves into Gull House, a lonely cottage on the coast, with her young daughter and her accommodating maid. It's a charming, two-story place with a large window and balcony overlooking the foaming breakers, filled with the nautical flotsam of the previous owner, a ship's captain who died at sea. It quickly becomes evident that the place is haunted by the misogynistic captain, Rex Harrison in a dark skipper's uniform and a devilish beard. Only Tierney can see and hear him. She overcomes her initial fear and the two begin to chat in a friendlier manner, although Harrison is always gruff and she is constantly complaining about his blasted language. But she's running out of money. Harrison wants her to keep the cottage and so he helps her write his spicy biography, although hardly anyone can believe she's written such a blasted good, rattling tale. She spurns George Sanders, a caddish seducer (what else?), and gets to keep the cottage, but Harrison disappears for good. Her little daughter grows up into Vanessa Brown, gets married, and Tierney and her maid are left in an empty nest. When she dies, Harrison reappears, takes Tierney's visible spirit by the hand, and they stroll off into the setting sun with quiet smiles. Sounds emetic, doesn't it? It sounds like the kind of movie that, if you're not careful, with either have you puking or experiencing a "wetting accident" during a fit of laughter. However, it's actually pretty moody and well done, despite the sappy-sounding story. Gene Tierney, never a dynamic actress, gets the job done nicely hear and looks supernally gorgeous, even in her old age, with that bit of powdery white flour brushed delicately into her hair. Rex Harrison does well by the role of ship's captain, even when he begins to melt slightly and treats her less like a habitant of the forecastle and more like the spirited woman she is, even taking to calling her "M'dear." No viewer would want anyone but Sanders for the role of the cad. He was perfection itself by 1947. And the supporting roles, even the minor ones, are affecting. Vanessa Brown was a pretty woman and Edna Best is Martha, the stalwart and sympathetic maid. It's certainly one of Bernard Hermann's better scores. Not as startling as "Vertigo" but a vast improvement over his BROOP-BROOP science fiction scores. It underlines the breath of mystery and slight melancholy that surrounds the place. You can almost taste the salt in the breeze. Trust me, men. Unless "Rambo II" is your idea of a splendid cinematic experience -- try this. You might like it.

    Gene Tierney plays Lucy Muir, a widow who decides to leave London where she has been living with her late husband's mother and sister, and move to a remote cottage by the sea. However, the cottage is haunted by the ghost of the former owner, the gruff sea captain Daniel Gregg (Rex Harrison). After an initial period of antagonism, the ghost and Mrs Muir start to have feelings for each other  but can two people from different worlds ever have a happy ending? This is a really charming movie (which spawned a subsequent television series), which combines mystery, romance and gentle comedy. Rex Harrison was a very talented actor, but never one who I could warm to. Here though, he is lovely and incredibly attractive. He plays the part of Captain Gregg very well  Gregg is brash and blunt, but he also has a capacity for empathy, and wants to protect Mrs Muir. Gene Tierney is luminous as the feisty Mrs Muir, and really was perfect in the role. Lucy Muir was a terrific character, and I felt for and admired her character, wishing for a happy life for her. The storyline is very sweet, and although I have no belief whatsoever in the ghosts or spirits, it never seemed ridiculous. There are loads of special little moments which add humour and poignancy to the story. I'm not giving away the ending, but I did think that it was perfect. The supporting cast were great  Edna Best as Martha, Lucy's maid; George Sanders as Miles Fairley, a very much alive man who romances Lucy Muir; and Natalie Wood (yes, that Natalie Wood) and Vanessa Brown as Mrs Muir's daughter Anna (Wood plays Anna as a child and Brown plays her as an adult). However, the film is all about the two lead characters, who have wonderful chemistry. Finally, a note on Bernand Herrman's very beautiful scorethe music in this film is wonderful, adding dramatic tension, and a tender atmosphere to the film. I often don't notice the music in a film (unless it is a musical), but the score here deserves the viewer's attention. All in all, a very enjoyable, sweet and not-at-all scary film.

    The word that best describes Rex Harrison as the Ghost is dynamic and Gene Tierney as Lucy Muir is innocently beautiful in favorable way. Both the Ghost and Mrs Muir compliment & compensate each other. People who would think this movie is too dreary to watch is like judging a book by its cover. This movie has a winning combination with touch of drama, somewhat spooky, a bit comical, but mostly romantic. Only when the Ghost is active or Mrs Muir is interacting with the Ghost are the parts I like best. This is the kind of movie I could watch over and over. The 1968-1970 TV series doesn't even compare to this timeless masterpiece.

    I absolutely love this film. It is so beautiful, haunting and somewhat poignant too. The Ghost and Mrs Muir hasn't dated I don't think, the cinematography is very fluid and beautiful and the sets and costumes are sumptuous. And the pacing is just fine, it adds to the haunting and poignant atmosphere. I also want to mention Bernard Hermann's score, it is truly outstanding and one of his best. And the story is wonderfully told with a great atmosphere, while the script is beautifully written especially the Captain's scene in the bedroom when he announces he is going away which not only gave me goosebumps but made me cry as well. The direction is spot-on, as is the acting. Rex Harrison is just superb as the ghostly Captain, gruff at first but he is quite sensitive as well. Gene Tierney- so entrancing in Laura- was a truly beautiful actress, and she looks lovely here and acts beautifully too, while George Sanders is quite dashing as Miles. Overall, an amazing film and I think it is worthy of a little more attention than it has. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    This movie is so dear to me. I first watched it with my mom when I was very young. She loved it, and I did too. The older I get, the more beautiful I realize this movie is. All of you young'uns brought up on "chick flicks" give this movie a watch and see what real grown-up men and women act like. Rex Harrison was never more handsome or charming, and that's saying a good deal! Gene Tierney was impossibly beautiful and hits just the right tone in her interpretation of this role. The score by Bernard Herrmann is gorgeous - somehow it reminds me of the score from Vertigo, which I also love. The film itself is gorgeously photographed. And choke me up? Oh, my gosh - when he leaves her, and laments "...What we've missed...what we've both missed." I defy you not to cry.

    The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947) What do you call this kind of contrivance, a situation set up by a fabulous circumstance, and then the inevitable unwinding of those circumstances? It's so artificial you want to scream for some sincerity, and yet it's so sincere, within its artifice, you are convinced, and intrigued. So here's the set-up. A widow moves to a house overlooking the ocean haunted by the ghost of a seaman who once lived there. And she decides she likes it, or wants it. And so we have the ghost in the form of Rex Harrison, and Mrs. Muir, the woman played with usual cool poise and cinematic good looks by Gene Tierney. The two don't quite fall in love at first, but a relationship grows, and a book is written. But that is just still the set-up. Mrs. Muir needs more that a pretend reality and a make-believe boyfriend. In comes a charming and somewhat dubious (at first) writer and painter played by George Sander. Conflicts arise, ideals are threatened, and the sky broods. It's a U.S. production but it is set in Britain (ostensibly) and has a very British, conversational feel. (Sanders and Harrison are British, of course, but Tierney is a Brooklyn girl. All of this is mostly amusing. Yes, American director Joseph L. Mankiewicz has made what almost feels at times like a romantic comedy, though more romance than laughs, especially after the first half. The set-up dilutes the impact of both the comedy and the drama a little. A true madcap could survive this kind of dreamy falseness, but a romance, to really move you, can't keep tripping over little tricks in the plot, and in the filming. So as good as all of this actually is, and as entertaining, it doesn't rip your heart out. And isn't that the idea? Maybe not always. It does move as much as it tickles. Its mystery is a little restrained, but it's still mysterious. It feels a bit literary at times, controlled and clever. But the actors, all three of them, fit that notion of sounding literate, and speaking clearly, of projecting never-ending poise. In the end, it's Gene Tierney's movie, and she holds it all together through its three distinct phases of the plot. By the last (fourth) brief section, the emotional threads pull together and it becomes a real tear-jerker for a few seconds. Which is plenty.

I often don't notice the music in a film (unless it is a musical), but the score here deserves the viewer's attention. All in all, a very enjoyable, sweet and not-at-all scary film.

    The word that best describes Rex Harrison as the Ghost is dynamic and Gene Tierney as Lucy Muir is innocently beautiful in favorable way. Both the Ghost and Mrs Muir compliment & compensate each other. People who would think this movie is too dreary to watch is like judging a book by its cover. This movie has a winning combination with touch of drama, somewhat spooky, a bit comical, but mostly romantic. Only when the Ghost is active or Mrs Muir is interacting with the Ghost are the parts I like best. This is the kind of movie I could watch over and over. The 1968-1970 TV series doesn't even compare to this timeless masterpiece.

    I absolutely love this film. It is so beautiful, haunting and somewhat poignant too. The Ghost and Mrs Muir hasn't dated I don't think, the cinematography is very fluid and beautiful and the sets and costumes are sumptuous. And the pacing is just fine, it adds to the haunting and poignant atmosphere. I also want to mention Bernard Hermann's score, it is truly outstanding and one of his best. And the story is wonderfully told with a great atmosphere, while the script is beautifully written especially the Captain's scene in the bedroom when he announces he is going away which not only gave me goosebumps but made me cry as well. The direction is spot-on, as is the acting. Rex Harrison is just superb as the ghostly Captain, gruff at first but he is quite sensitive as well. Gene Tierney- so entrancing in Laura- was a truly beautiful actress, and she looks lovely here and acts beautifully too, while George Sanders is quite dashing as Miles. Overall, an amazing film and I think it is worthy of a little more attention than it has. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    This movie is so dear to me. I first watched it with my mom when I was very young. She loved it, and I did too. The older I get, the more beautiful I realize this movie is. All of you young'uns brought up on "chick flicks" give this movie a watch and see what real grown-up men and women act like. Rex Harrison was never more handsome or charming, and that's saying a good deal! Gene Tierney was impossibly beautiful and hits just the right tone in her interpretation of this role. The score by Bernard Herrmann is gorgeous - somehow it reminds me of the score from Vertigo, which I also love. The film itself is gorgeously photographed. And choke me up? Oh, my gosh - when he leaves her, and laments "...What we've missed...what we've both missed." I defy you not to cry.

    The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947) What do you call this kind of contrivance, a situation set up by a fabulous circumstance, and then the inevitable unwinding of those circumstances? It's so artificial you want to scream for some sincerity, and yet it's so sincere, within its artifice, you are convinced, and intrigued. So here's the set-up. A widow moves to a house overlooking the ocean haunted by the ghost of a seaman who once lived there. And she decides she likes it, or wants it. And so we have the ghost in the form of Rex Harrison, and Mrs. Muir, the woman played with usual cool poise and cinematic good looks by Gene Tierney. The two don't quite fall in love at first, but a relationship grows, and a book is written. But that is just still the set-up. Mrs. Muir needs more that a pretend reality and a make-believe boyfriend. In comes a charming and somewhat dubious (at first) writer and painter played by George Sander. Conflicts arise, ideals are threatened, and the sky broods. It's a U.S. production but it is set in Britain (ostensibly) and has a very British, conversational feel. (Sanders and Harrison are British, of course, but Tierney is a Brooklyn girl. All of this is mostly amusing. Yes, American director Joseph L. Mankiewicz has made what almost feels at times like a romantic comedy, though more romance than laughs, especially after the first half. The set-up dilutes the impact of both the comedy and the drama a little. A true madcap could survive this kind of dreamy falseness, but a romance, to really move you, can't keep tripping over little tricks in the plot, and in the filming. So as good as all of this actually is, and as entertaining, it doesn't rip your heart out. And isn't that the idea? Maybe not always. It does move as much as it tickles. Its mystery is a little restrained, but it's still mysterious. It feels a bit literary at times, controlled and clever. But the actors, all three of them, fit that notion of sounding literate, and speaking clearly, of projecting never-ending poise. In the end, it's Gene Tierney's movie, and she holds it all together through its three distinct phases of the plot. By the last (fourth) brief section, the emotional threads pull together and it becomes a real tear-jerker for a few seconds. Which is plenty.

    Natalie Wood, and Gene Tierney give wonderful performances in a classic haunting tale,, a woman writer moves into a haunted house by the sea to get some well needed rest and peace and quiet,, apparently the house is haunted by a ship's captain.. he tries to drive her out at first as he has gotten used to the peace and quiet,, but she is spunky and won't go quietly. the two seem to get along with each other after a while and so they agree on a truce of sorts. later on her finances are dwindling and she needs to raise money , so the captain agrees to let her write his autobiography.. , there is also a man in the picture a live one who wants the young lady and now has to contend with the ghost,, I thought this was a very good movie,, I didn't need any action,, didn't need that many scares either,, I think there were a few,, but overall I enjoyed the picture very well,, as it was told well, and the story had good pacing and moved along quickly so you the viewer were never bored.

    This is a rewarding genre spanning film that combines elements of mystery, drama, humor, and romance in a uniquely compelling way. Gene Tierney is simply gorgeous in the title role of Mrs. Muir, while Rex Harrison's bombast as the ghostly sea captain mellows over time to engage his house guest as a worthy companion and suitor. It's intriguing that the story never goes in the direction of creating some sort of sexual tension between the principals. It's all believably platonic, with the interjection of a suitable cad (George Sanders) to woo Mrs. Muir in a relationship destined for failure. Depending on your approach, the film can be interpreted on many levels. Was Mrs. Muir's ghost a figment of her imagination, a dream, or some other unexplained phenomenon? One's own interpretation may change upon subsequent viewings. I've seen this picture a couple of times and found it to be a rewarding film with rich dialog, crisp photography and a wonderful Bernard Herrmann score to capture the ethereal mood.

    "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" is a supernatural fantasy film of a type which was popular in the forties; other American examples include "I Married a Witch", "Heaven Can Wait" (which also starred Gene Tierney), "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Portrait of Jennie". There were also British equivalents such as "Blithe Spirit" (which also starred Rex Harrison), "A Matter of Life and Death" and "Pandora and the Flying Dutchman" (this latter being from the early fifties). The film can, alternatively, be though of as a romantic comedy. Most rom-coms deal with the story of how a couple overcome an obstacle to their love, and in this case the obstacle seems a formidable one indeed- one of them is alive, the other dead. Although the film was shot entirely in California, it is set in Edwardian England. Lucy Muir, a beautiful young widow, moves into a seaside cottage with her young daughter Anna and her maid Martha. She discovers that the house is haunted by the ghost of its former owner, a sea captain named Daniel Gregg. Daniel initially seems like a difficult, testy character, but he soon shows that he has a decent, kindly side to his nature. When Lucy gets into financial difficulties he saves the day by dictating to her his memoirs of his seafaring life and allowing her to publish them and collect the royalties; when the book becomes a bestseller, Lucy becomes a wealthy woman. Lucy and the ghostly Daniel fall in love, but realise that theirs is a hopeless situation, and Lucy forms an attachment to Miles Fairley, a writer of children's stories. There were a number of contenders for the title of "most beautiful film star of the forties" (Ava Gardner, Jennifer Jones, Ingrid Bergman, Rita Hayworth, Lana Turner, Veronica Lake and others), but had I been a judge in a hypothetical "Miss Hollywood" contest, my vote would have gone to Gene Tierney. Although her British accent is not always spot-on, the lovely Gene makes an absolutely adorable heroine here. Rex Harrison (generally at his best in comedy, although he could also be good in serious films like "The Agony and the Ecstasy") gives a good performance as the salty old seadog Daniel, playing him as a likable rogue. George Sanders was always a good villain, and here plays Miles as a suave but oily charmer; it comes as no surprise when (like a number of characters played by Sanders) he turns out to be an utter cad. There is also a good contribution from Edna Best as Martha; the young Anna is played by an eight-year-old Natalie Wood. (Like Elizabeth Taylor, Natalie was to become so famous as an adult that one forgets she started her career as a child star). I would not rate "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" quite as highly as films like "It's a Wonderful Life" or "A Matter of Life and Death", both of which have a greater depth and rank among the best films of the forties, but it is nevertheless a very enjoyable light fantasies. And, as in all the best rom-coms, there is eventually to be a happy ending of sorts. 7/10

    A classic, by definition, is something that cannot be improved, and one could hardly wring more old time charm out of a picture than this one does. Rex Harrison is great as the ghost of a cantankerous sea captain who haunts the seaside house of widow Gene Tierney. He makes an unlikely but compelling romantic figure and soon the mismatched couple fall in love despite the obvious handicap that Harrison is already dead. This is Old School Hollywood 200 proof moonshine to be sure - the production design and costumes seem quite posh for a young widow of supposedly limited means - but everything is so carefully contrived to manipulate the audience to rally emotionally around the unlikely twosome that a little extra prettying up just makes for an even more watchable experience.

    It's the turn of the century. Gene Tierney is the beautiful widow, Mrs. Muir. More or less thrown out by her priggish older sisters she moves into Gull House, a lonely cottage on the coast, with her young daughter and her accommodating maid. It's a charming, two-story place with a large window and balcony overlooking the foaming breakers, filled with the nautical flotsam of the previous owner, a ship's captain who died at sea. It quickly becomes evident that the place is haunted by the misogynistic captain, Rex Harrison in a dark skipper's uniform and a devilish beard. Only Tierney can see and hear him. She overcomes her initial fear and the two begin to chat in a friendlier manner, although Harrison is always gruff and she is constantly complaining about his blasted language. But she's running out of money. Harrison wants her to keep the cottage and so he helps her write his spicy biography, although hardly anyone can believe she's written such a blasted good, rattling tale. She spurns George Sanders, a caddish seducer (what else?), and gets to keep the cottage, but Harrison disappears for good. Her little daughter grows up into Vanessa Brown, gets married, and Tierney and her maid are left in an empty nest. When she dies, Harrison reappears, takes Tierney's visible spirit by the hand, and they stroll off into the setting sun with quiet smiles. Sounds emetic, doesn't it? It sounds like the kind of movie that, if you're not careful, with either have you puking or experiencing a "wetting accident" during a fit of laughter. However, it's actually pretty moody and well done, despite the sappy-sounding story. Gene Tierney, never a dynamic actress, gets the job done nicely hear and looks supernally gorgeous, even in her old age, with that bit of powdery white flour brushed delicately into her hair. Rex Harrison does well by the role of ship's captain, even when he begins to melt slightly and treats her less like a habitant of the forecastle and more like the spirited woman she is, even taking to calling her "M'dear." No viewer would want anyone but Sanders for the role of the cad. He was perfection itself by 1947. And the supporting roles, even the minor ones, are affecting. Vanessa Brown was a pretty woman and Edna Best is Martha, the stalwart and sympathetic maid. It's certainly one of Bernard Hermann's better scores. Not as startling as "Vertigo" but a vast improvement over his BROOP-BROOP science fiction scores. It underlines the breath of mystery and slight melancholy that surrounds the place. You can almost taste the salt in the breeze. Trust me, men. Unless "Rambo II" is your idea of a splendid cinematic experience -- try this. You might like it.

    Gene Tierney plays Lucy Muir, a widow who decides to leave London where she has been living with her late husband's mother and sister, and move to a remote cottage by the sea. However, the cottage is haunted by the ghost of the former owner, the gruff sea captain Daniel Gregg (Rex Harrison). After an initial period of antagonism, the ghost and Mrs Muir start to have feelings for each other  but can two people from different worlds ever have a happy ending? This is a really charming movie (which spawned a subsequent television series), which combines mystery, romance and gentle comedy. Rex Harrison was a very talented actor, but never one who I could warm to. Here though, he is lovely and incredibly attractive. He plays the part of Captain Gregg very well  Gregg is brash and blunt, but he also has a capacity for empathy, and wants to protect Mrs Muir. Gene Tierney is luminous as the feisty Mrs Muir, and really was perfect in the role. Lucy Muir was a terrific character, and I felt for and admired her character, wishing for a happy life for her. The storyline is very sweet, and although I have no belief whatsoever in the ghosts or spirits, it never seemed ridiculous. There are loads of special little moments which add humour and poignancy to the story. I'm not giving away the ending, but I did think that it was perfect. The supporting cast were great  Edna Best as Martha, Lucy's maid; George Sanders as Miles Fairley, a very much alive man who romances Lucy Muir; and Natalie Wood (yes, that Natalie Wood) and Vanessa Brown as Mrs Muir's daughter Anna (Wood plays Anna as a child and Brown plays her as an adult). However, the film is all about the two lead characters, who have wonderful chemistry. Finally, a note on Bernand Herrman's very beautiful scorethe music in this film is wonderful, adding dramatic tension, and a tender atmosphere to the film. I often don't notice the music in a film (unless it is a musical), but the score here deserves the viewer's attention. All in all, a very enjoyable, sweet and not-at-all scary film.

It's a charming, two-story place with a large window and balcony overlooking the foaming breakers, filled with the nautical flotsam of the previous owner, a ship's captain who died at sea. It quickly becomes evident that the place is haunted by the misogynistic captain, Rex Harrison in a dark skipper's uniform and a devilish beard. Only Tierney can see and hear him. She overcomes her initial fear and the two begin to chat in a friendlier manner, although Harrison is always gruff and she is constantly complaining about his blasted language. But she's running out of money. Harrison wants her to keep the cottage and so he helps her write his spicy biography, although hardly anyone can believe she's written such a blasted good, rattling tale. She spurns George Sanders, a caddish seducer (what else?), and gets to keep the cottage, but Harrison disappears for good. Her little daughter grows up into Vanessa Brown, gets married, and Tierney and her maid are left in an empty nest. When she dies, Harrison reappears, takes Tierney's visible spirit by the hand, and they stroll off into the setting sun with quiet smiles. Sounds emetic, doesn't it? It sounds like the kind of movie that, if you're not careful, with either have you puking or experiencing a "wetting accident" during a fit of laughter. However, it's actually pretty moody and well done, despite the sappy-sounding story. Gene Tierney, never a dynamic actress, gets the job done nicely hear and looks supernally gorgeous, even in her old age, with that bit of powdery white flour brushed delicately into her hair. Rex Harrison does well by the role of ship's captain, even when he begins to melt slightly and treats her less like a habitant of the forecastle and more like the spirited woman she is, even taking to calling her "M'dear." No viewer would want anyone but Sanders for the role of the cad. He was perfection itself by 1947. And the supporting roles, even the minor ones, are affecting. Vanessa Brown was a pretty woman and Edna Best is Martha, the stalwart and sympathetic maid. It's certainly one of Bernard Hermann's better scores. Not as startling as "Vertigo" but a vast improvement over his BROOP-BROOP science fiction scores. It underlines the breath of mystery and slight melancholy that surrounds the place. You can almost taste the salt in the breeze. Trust me, men. Unless "Rambo II" is your idea of a splendid cinematic experience -- try this. You might like it.

    Gene Tierney plays Lucy Muir, a widow who decides to leave London where she has been living with her late husband's mother and sister, and move to a remote cottage by the sea. However, the cottage is haunted by the ghost of the former owner, the gruff sea captain Daniel Gregg (Rex Harrison). After an initial period of antagonism, the ghost and Mrs Muir start to have feelings for each other  but can two people from different worlds ever have a happy ending? This is a really charming movie (which spawned a subsequent television series), which combines mystery, romance and gentle comedy. Rex Harrison was a very talented actor, but never one who I could warm to. Here though, he is lovely and incredibly attractive. He plays the part of Captain Gregg very well  Gregg is brash and blunt, but he also has a capacity for empathy, and wants to protect Mrs Muir. Gene Tierney is luminous as the feisty Mrs Muir, and really was perfect in the role. Lucy Muir was a terrific character, and I felt for and admired her character, wishing for a happy life for her. The storyline is very sweet, and although I have no belief whatsoever in the ghosts or spirits, it never seemed ridiculous. There are loads of special little moments which add humour and poignancy to the story. I'm not giving away the ending, but I did think that it was perfect. The supporting cast were great  Edna Best as Martha, Lucy's maid; George Sanders as Miles Fairley, a very much alive man who romances Lucy Muir; and Natalie Wood (yes, that Natalie Wood) and Vanessa Brown as Mrs Muir's daughter Anna (Wood plays Anna as a child and Brown plays her as an adult). However, the film is all about the two lead characters, who have wonderful chemistry. Finally, a note on Bernand Herrman's very beautiful scorethe music in this film is wonderful, adding dramatic tension, and a tender atmosphere to the film. I often don't notice the music in a film (unless it is a musical), but the score here deserves the viewer's attention. All in all, a very enjoyable, sweet and not-at-all scary film.

    The word that best describes Rex Harrison as the Ghost is dynamic and Gene Tierney as Lucy Muir is innocently beautiful in favorable way. Both the Ghost and Mrs Muir compliment & compensate each other. People who would think this movie is too dreary to watch is like judging a book by its cover. This movie has a winning combination with touch of drama, somewhat spooky, a bit comical, but mostly romantic. Only when the Ghost is active or Mrs Muir is interacting with the Ghost are the parts I like best. This is the kind of movie I could watch over and over. The 1968-1970 TV series doesn't even compare to this timeless masterpiece.

    I absolutely love this film. It is so beautiful, haunting and somewhat poignant too. The Ghost and Mrs Muir hasn't dated I don't think, the cinematography is very fluid and beautiful and the sets and costumes are sumptuous. And the pacing is just fine, it adds to the haunting and poignant atmosphere. I also want to mention Bernard Hermann's score, it is truly outstanding and one of his best. And the story is wonderfully told with a great atmosphere, while the script is beautifully written especially the Captain's scene in the bedroom when he announces he is going away which not only gave me goosebumps but made me cry as well. The direction is spot-on, as is the acting. Rex Harrison is just superb as the ghostly Captain, gruff at first but he is quite sensitive as well. Gene Tierney- so entrancing in Laura- was a truly beautiful actress, and she looks lovely here and acts beautifully too, while George Sanders is quite dashing as Miles. Overall, an amazing film and I think it is worthy of a little more attention than it has. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    This movie is so dear to me. I first watched it with my mom when I was very young. She loved it, and I did too. The older I get, the more beautiful I realize this movie is. All of you young'uns brought up on "chick flicks" give this movie a watch and see what real grown-up men and women act like. Rex Harrison was never more handsome or charming, and that's saying a good deal! Gene Tierney was impossibly beautiful and hits just the right tone in her interpretation of this role. The score by Bernard Herrmann is gorgeous - somehow it reminds me of the score from Vertigo, which I also love. The film itself is gorgeously photographed. And choke me up? Oh, my gosh - when he leaves her, and laments "...What we've missed...what we've both missed." I defy you not to cry.

    The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947) What do you call this kind of contrivance, a situation set up by a fabulous circumstance, and then the inevitable unwinding of those circumstances? It's so artificial you want to scream for some sincerity, and yet it's so sincere, within its artifice, you are convinced, and intrigued. So here's the set-up. A widow moves to a house overlooking the ocean haunted by the ghost of a seaman who once lived there. And she decides she likes it, or wants it. And so we have the ghost in the form of Rex Harrison, and Mrs. Muir, the woman played with usual cool poise and cinematic good looks by Gene Tierney. The two don't quite fall in love at first, but a relationship grows, and a book is written. But that is just still the set-up. Mrs. Muir needs more that a pretend reality and a make-believe boyfriend. In comes a charming and somewhat dubious (at first) writer and painter played by George Sander. Conflicts arise, ideals are threatened, and the sky broods. It's a U.S. production but it is set in Britain (ostensibly) and has a very British, conversational feel. (Sanders and Harrison are British, of course, but Tierney is a Brooklyn girl. All of this is mostly amusing. Yes, American director Joseph L. Mankiewicz has made what almost feels at times like a romantic comedy, though more romance than laughs, especially after the first half. The set-up dilutes the impact of both the comedy and the drama a little. A true madcap could survive this kind of dreamy falseness, but a romance, to really move you, can't keep tripping over little tricks in the plot, and in the filming. So as good as all of this actually is, and as entertaining, it doesn't rip your heart out. And isn't that the idea? Maybe not always. It does move as much as it tickles. Its mystery is a little restrained, but it's still mysterious. It feels a bit literary at times, controlled and clever. But the actors, all three of them, fit that notion of sounding literate, and speaking clearly, of projecting never-ending poise. In the end, it's Gene Tierney's movie, and she holds it all together through its three distinct phases of the plot. By the last (fourth) brief section, the emotional threads pull together and it becomes a real tear-jerker for a few seconds. Which is plenty.

    Natalie Wood, and Gene Tierney give wonderful performances in a classic haunting tale,, a woman writer moves into a haunted house by the sea to get some well needed rest and peace and quiet,, apparently the house is haunted by a ship's captain.. he tries to drive her out at first as he has gotten used to the peace and quiet,, but she is spunky and won't go quietly. the two seem to get along with each other after a while and so they agree on a truce of sorts. later on her finances are dwindling and she needs to raise money , so the captain agrees to let her write his autobiography.. , there is also a man in the picture a live one who wants the young lady and now has to contend with the ghost,, I thought this was a very good movie,, I didn't need any action,, didn't need that many scares either,, I think there were a few,, but overall I enjoyed the picture very well,, as it was told well, and the story had good pacing and moved along quickly so you the viewer were never bored.

    This is a rewarding genre spanning film that combines elements of mystery, drama, humor, and romance in a uniquely compelling way. Gene Tierney is simply gorgeous in the title role of Mrs. Muir, while Rex Harrison's bombast as the ghostly sea captain mellows over time to engage his house guest as a worthy companion and suitor. It's intriguing that the story never goes in the direction of creating some sort of sexual tension between the principals. It's all believably platonic, with the interjection of a suitable cad (George Sanders) to woo Mrs. Muir in a relationship destined for failure. Depending on your approach, the film can be interpreted on many levels. Was Mrs. Muir's ghost a figment of her imagination, a dream, or some other unexplained phenomenon? One's own interpretation may change upon subsequent viewings. I've seen this picture a couple of times and found it to be a rewarding film with rich dialog, crisp photography and a wonderful Bernard Herrmann score to capture the ethereal mood.

    "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" is a supernatural fantasy film of a type which was popular in the forties; other American examples include "I Married a Witch", "Heaven Can Wait" (which also starred Gene Tierney), "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Portrait of Jennie". There were also British equivalents such as "Blithe Spirit" (which also starred Rex Harrison), "A Matter of Life and Death" and "Pandora and the Flying Dutchman" (this latter being from the early fifties). The film can, alternatively, be though of as a romantic comedy. Most rom-coms deal with the story of how a couple overcome an obstacle to their love, and in this case the obstacle seems a formidable one indeed- one of them is alive, the other dead. Although the film was shot entirely in California, it is set in Edwardian England. Lucy Muir, a beautiful young widow, moves into a seaside cottage with her young daughter Anna and her maid Martha. She discovers that the house is haunted by the ghost of its former owner, a sea captain named Daniel Gregg. Daniel initially seems like a difficult, testy character, but he soon shows that he has a decent, kindly side to his nature. When Lucy gets into financial difficulties he saves the day by dictating to her his memoirs of his seafaring life and allowing her to publish them and collect the royalties; when the book becomes a bestseller, Lucy becomes a wealthy woman. Lucy and the ghostly Daniel fall in love, but realise that theirs is a hopeless situation, and Lucy forms an attachment to Miles Fairley, a writer of children's stories. There were a number of contenders for the title of "most beautiful film star of the forties" (Ava Gardner, Jennifer Jones, Ingrid Bergman, Rita Hayworth, Lana Turner, Veronica Lake and others), but had I been a judge in a hypothetical "Miss Hollywood" contest, my vote would have gone to Gene Tierney. Although her British accent is not always spot-on, the lovely Gene makes an absolutely adorable heroine here. Rex Harrison (generally at his best in comedy, although he could also be good in serious films like "The Agony and the Ecstasy") gives a good performance as the salty old seadog Daniel, playing him as a likable rogue. George Sanders was always a good villain, and here plays Miles as a suave but oily charmer; it comes as no surprise when (like a number of characters played by Sanders) he turns out to be an utter cad. There is also a good contribution from Edna Best as Martha; the young Anna is played by an eight-year-old Natalie Wood. (Like Elizabeth Taylor, Natalie was to become so famous as an adult that one forgets she started her career as a child star). I would not rate "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" quite as highly as films like "It's a Wonderful Life" or "A Matter of Life and Death", both of which have a greater depth and rank among the best films of the forties, but it is nevertheless a very enjoyable light fantasies. And, as in all the best rom-coms, there is eventually to be a happy ending of sorts. 7/10

    A classic, by definition, is something that cannot be improved, and one could hardly wring more old time charm out of a picture than this one does. Rex Harrison is great as the ghost of a cantankerous sea captain who haunts the seaside house of widow Gene Tierney. He makes an unlikely but compelling romantic figure and soon the mismatched couple fall in love despite the obvious handicap that Harrison is already dead. This is Old School Hollywood 200 proof moonshine to be sure - the production design and costumes seem quite posh for a young widow of supposedly limited means - but everything is so carefully contrived to manipulate the audience to rally emotionally around the unlikely twosome that a little extra prettying up just makes for an even more watchable experience.

    "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" is a supernatural fantasy film of a type which was popular in the forties; other American examples include "I Married a Witch", "Heaven Can Wait" (which also starred Gene Tierney), "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Portrait of Jennie". There were also British equivalents such as "Blithe Spirit" (which also starred Rex Harrison), "A Matter of Life and Death" and "Pandora and the Flying Dutchman" (this latter being from the early fifties). The film can, alternatively, be though of as a romantic comedy. Most rom-coms deal with the story of how a couple overcome an obstacle to their love, and in this case the obstacle seems a formidable one indeed- one of them is alive, the other dead. Although the film was shot entirely in California, it is set in Edwardian England. Lucy Muir, a beautiful young widow, moves into a seaside cottage with her young daughter Anna and her maid Martha. She discovers that the house is haunted by the ghost of its former owner, a sea captain named Daniel Gregg. Daniel initially seems like a difficult, testy character, but he soon shows that he has a decent, kindly side to his nature. When Lucy gets into financial difficulties he saves the day by dictating to her his memoirs of his seafaring life and allowing her to publish them and collect the royalties; when the book becomes a bestseller, Lucy becomes a wealthy woman. Lucy and the ghostly Daniel fall in love, but realise that theirs is a hopeless situation, and Lucy forms an attachment to Miles Fairley, a writer of children's stories. There were a number of contenders for the title of "most beautiful film star of the forties" (Ava Gardner, Jennifer Jones, Ingrid Bergman, Rita Hayworth, Lana Turner, Veronica Lake and others), but had I been a judge in a hypothetical "Miss Hollywood" contest, my vote would have gone to Gene Tierney. Although her British accent is not always spot-on, the lovely Gene makes an absolutely adorable heroine here. Rex Harrison (generally at his best in comedy, although he could also be good in serious films like "The Agony and the Ecstasy") gives a good performance as the salty old seadog Daniel, playing him as a likable rogue. George Sanders was always a good villain, and here plays Miles as a suave but oily charmer; it comes as no surprise when (like a number of characters played by Sanders) he turns out to be an utter cad. There is also a good contribution from Edna Best as Martha; the young Anna is played by an eight-year-old Natalie Wood. (Like Elizabeth Taylor, Natalie was to become so famous as an adult that one forgets she started her career as a child star). I would not rate "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" quite as highly as films like "It's a Wonderful Life" or "A Matter of Life and Death", both of which have a greater depth and rank among the best films of the forties, but it is nevertheless a very enjoyable light fantasies. And, as in all the best rom-coms, there is eventually to be a happy ending of sorts. 7/10

    A classic, by definition, is something that cannot be improved, and one could hardly wring more old time charm out of a picture than this one does. Rex Harrison is great as the ghost of a cantankerous sea captain who haunts the seaside house of widow Gene Tierney. He makes an unlikely but compelling romantic figure and soon the mismatched couple fall in love despite the obvious handicap that Harrison is already dead. This is Old School Hollywood 200 proof moonshine to be sure - the production design and costumes seem quite posh for a young widow of supposedly limited means - but everything is so carefully contrived to manipulate the audience to rally emotionally around the unlikely twosome that a little extra prettying up just makes for an even more watchable experience.

    It's the turn of the century. Gene Tierney is the beautiful widow, Mrs. Muir. More or less thrown out by her priggish older sisters she moves into Gull House, a lonely cottage on the coast, with her young daughter and her accommodating maid. It's a charming, two-story place with a large window and balcony overlooking the foaming breakers, filled with the nautical flotsam of the previous owner, a ship's captain who died at sea. It quickly becomes evident that the place is haunted by the misogynistic captain, Rex Harrison in a dark skipper's uniform and a devilish beard. Only Tierney can see and hear him. She overcomes her initial fear and the two begin to chat in a friendlier manner, although Harrison is always gruff and she is constantly complaining about his blasted language. But she's running out of money. Harrison wants her to keep the cottage and so he helps her write his spicy biography, although hardly anyone can believe she's written such a blasted good, rattling tale. She spurns George Sanders, a caddish seducer (what else?), and gets to keep the cottage, but Harrison disappears for good. Her little daughter grows up into Vanessa Brown, gets married, and Tierney and her maid are left in an empty nest. When she dies, Harrison reappears, takes Tierney's visible spirit by the hand, and they stroll off into the setting sun with quiet smiles. Sounds emetic, doesn't it? It sounds like the kind of movie that, if you're not careful, with either have you puking or experiencing a "wetting accident" during a fit of laughter. However, it's actually pretty moody and well done, despite the sappy-sounding story. Gene Tierney, never a dynamic actress, gets the job done nicely hear and looks supernally gorgeous, even in her old age, with that bit of powdery white flour brushed delicately into her hair. Rex Harrison does well by the role of ship's captain, even when he begins to melt slightly and treats her less like a habitant of the forecastle and more like the spirited woman she is, even taking to calling her "M'dear." No viewer would want anyone but Sanders for the role of the cad. He was perfection itself by 1947. And the supporting roles, even the minor ones, are affecting. Vanessa Brown was a pretty woman and Edna Best is Martha, the stalwart and sympathetic maid. It's certainly one of Bernard Hermann's better scores. Not as startling as "Vertigo" but a vast improvement over his BROOP-BROOP science fiction scores. It underlines the breath of mystery and slight melancholy that surrounds the place. You can almost taste the salt in the breeze. Trust me, men. Unless "Rambo II" is your idea of a splendid cinematic experience -- try this. You might like it.

    Gene Tierney plays Lucy Muir, a widow who decides to leave London where she has been living with her late husband's mother and sister, and move to a remote cottage by the sea. However, the cottage is haunted by the ghost of the former owner, the gruff sea captain Daniel Gregg (Rex Harrison). After an initial period of antagonism, the ghost and Mrs Muir start to have feelings for each other  but can two people from different worlds ever have a happy ending? This is a really charming movie (which spawned a subsequent television series), which combines mystery, romance and gentle comedy. Rex Harrison was a very talented actor, but never one who I could warm to. Here though, he is lovely and incredibly attractive. He plays the part of Captain Gregg very well  Gregg is brash and blunt, but he also has a capacity for empathy, and wants to protect Mrs Muir. Gene Tierney is luminous as the feisty Mrs Muir, and really was perfect in the role. Lucy Muir was a terrific character, and I felt for and admired her character, wishing for a happy life for her. The storyline is very sweet, and although I have no belief whatsoever in the ghosts or spirits, it never seemed ridiculous. There are loads of special little moments which add humour and poignancy to the story. I'm not giving away the ending, but I did think that it was perfect. The supporting cast were great  Edna Best as Martha, Lucy's maid; George Sanders as Miles Fairley, a very much alive man who romances Lucy Muir; and Natalie Wood (yes, that Natalie Wood) and Vanessa Brown as Mrs Muir's daughter Anna (Wood plays Anna as a child and Brown plays her as an adult). However, the film is all about the two lead characters, who have wonderful chemistry. Finally, a note on Bernand Herrman's very beautiful scorethe music in this film is wonderful, adding dramatic tension, and a tender atmosphere to the film. I often don't notice the music in a film (unless it is a musical), but the score here deserves the viewer's attention. All in all, a very enjoyable, sweet and not-at-all scary film.

    The word that best describes Rex Harrison as the Ghost is dynamic and Gene Tierney as Lucy Muir is innocently beautiful in favorable way. Both the Ghost and Mrs Muir compliment & compensate each other. People who would think this movie is too dreary to watch is like judging a book by its cover. This movie has a winning combination with touch of drama, somewhat spooky, a bit comical, but mostly romantic. Only when the Ghost is active or Mrs Muir is interacting with the Ghost are the parts I like best. This is the kind of movie I could watch over and over. The 1968-1970 TV series doesn't even compare to this timeless masterpiece.

    I absolutely love this film. It is so beautiful, haunting and somewhat poignant too. The Ghost and Mrs Muir hasn't dated I don't think, the cinematography is very fluid and beautiful and the sets and costumes are sumptuous. And the pacing is just fine, it adds to the haunting and poignant atmosphere. I also want to mention Bernard Hermann's score, it is truly outstanding and one of his best. And the story is wonderfully told with a great atmosphere, while the script is beautifully written especially the Captain's scene in the bedroom when he announces he is going away which not only gave me goosebumps but made me cry as well. The direction is spot-on, as is the acting. Rex Harrison is just superb as the ghostly Captain, gruff at first but he is quite sensitive as well. Gene Tierney- so entrancing in Laura- was a truly beautiful actress, and she looks lovely here and acts beautifully too, while George Sanders is quite dashing as Miles. Overall, an amazing film and I think it is worthy of a little more attention than it has. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    This movie is so dear to me. I first watched it with my mom when I was very young. She loved it, and I did too. The older I get, the more beautiful I realize this movie is. All of you young'uns brought up on "chick flicks" give this movie a watch and see what real grown-up men and women act like. Rex Harrison was never more handsome or charming, and that's saying a good deal! Gene Tierney was impossibly beautiful and hits just the right tone in her interpretation of this role. The score by Bernard Herrmann is gorgeous - somehow it reminds me of the score from Vertigo, which I also love. The film itself is gorgeously photographed. And choke me up? Oh, my gosh - when he leaves her, and laments "...What we've missed...what we've both missed." I defy you not to cry.

    The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947) What do you call this kind of contrivance, a situation set up by a fabulous circumstance, and then the inevitable unwinding of those circumstances? It's so artificial you want to scream for some sincerity, and yet it's so sincere, within its artifice, you are convinced, and intrigued. So here's the set-up. A widow moves to a house overlooking the ocean haunted by the ghost of a seaman who once lived there. And she decides she likes it, or wants it. And so we have the ghost in the form of Rex Harrison, and Mrs. Muir, the woman played with usual cool poise and cinematic good looks by Gene Tierney. The two don't quite fall in love at first, but a relationship grows, and a book is written. But that is just still the set-up. Mrs. Muir needs more that a pretend reality and a make-believe boyfriend. In comes a charming and somewhat dubious (at first) writer and painter played by George Sander. Conflicts arise, ideals are threatened, and the sky broods. It's a U.S. production but it is set in Britain (ostensibly) and has a very British, conversational feel. (Sanders and Harrison are British, of course, but Tierney is a Brooklyn girl. All of this is mostly amusing. Yes, American director Joseph L. Mankiewicz has made what almost feels at times like a romantic comedy, though more romance than laughs, especially after the first half. The set-up dilutes the impact of both the comedy and the drama a little. A true madcap could survive this kind of dreamy falseness, but a romance, to really move you, can't keep tripping over little tricks in the plot, and in the filming. So as good as all of this actually is, and as entertaining, it doesn't rip your heart out. And isn't that the idea? Maybe not always. It does move as much as it tickles. Its mystery is a little restrained, but it's still mysterious. It feels a bit literary at times, controlled and clever. But the actors, all three of them, fit that notion of sounding literate, and speaking clearly, of projecting never-ending poise. In the end, it's Gene Tierney's movie, and she holds it all together through its three distinct phases of the plot. By the last (fourth) brief section, the emotional threads pull together and it becomes a real tear-jerker for a few seconds. Which is plenty.

    Natalie Wood, and Gene Tierney give wonderful performances in a classic haunting tale,, a woman writer moves into a haunted house by the sea to get some well needed rest and peace and quiet,, apparently the house is haunted by a ship's captain.. he tries to drive her out at first as he has gotten used to the peace and quiet,, but she is spunky and won't go quietly. the two seem to get along with each other after a while and so they agree on a truce of sorts. later on her finances are dwindling and she needs to raise money , so the captain agrees to let her write his autobiography.. , there is also a man in the picture a live one who wants the young lady and now has to contend with the ghost,, I thought this was a very good movie,, I didn't need any action,, didn't need that many scares either,, I think there were a few,, but overall I enjoyed the picture very well,, as it was told well, and the story had good pacing and moved along quickly so you the viewer were never bored.

    This is a rewarding genre spanning film that combines elements of mystery, drama, humor, and romance in a uniquely compelling way. Gene Tierney is simply gorgeous in the title role of Mrs. Muir, while Rex Harrison's bombast as the ghostly sea captain mellows over time to engage his house guest as a worthy companion and suitor. It's intriguing that the story never goes in the direction of creating some sort of sexual tension between the principals. It's all believably platonic, with the interjection of a suitable cad (George Sanders) to woo Mrs. Muir in a relationship destined for failure. Depending on your approach, the film can be interpreted on many levels. Was Mrs. Muir's ghost a figment of her imagination, a dream, or some other unexplained phenomenon? One's own interpretation may change upon subsequent viewings. I've seen this picture a couple of times and found it to be a rewarding film with rich dialog, crisp photography and a wonderful Bernard Herrmann score to capture the ethereal mood.

(Sanders and Harrison are British, of course, but Tierney is a Brooklyn girl. All of this is mostly amusing. Yes, American director Joseph L. Mankiewicz has made what almost feels at times like a romantic comedy, though more romance than laughs, especially after the first half. The set-up dilutes the impact of both the comedy and the drama a little. A true madcap could survive this kind of dreamy falseness, but a romance, to really move you, can't keep tripping over little tricks in the plot, and in the filming. So as good as all of this actually is, and as entertaining, it doesn't rip your heart out. And isn't that the idea? Maybe not always. It does move as much as it tickles. Its mystery is a little restrained, but it's still mysterious. It feels a bit literary at times, controlled and clever. But the actors, all three of them, fit that notion of sounding literate, and speaking clearly, of projecting never-ending poise. In the end, it's Gene Tierney's movie, and she holds it all together through its three distinct phases of the plot. By the last (fourth) brief section, the emotional threads pull together and it becomes a real tear-jerker for a few seconds. Which is plenty.

    Natalie Wood, and Gene Tierney give wonderful performances in a classic haunting tale,, a woman writer moves into a haunted house by the sea to get some well needed rest and peace and quiet,, apparently the house is haunted by a ship's captain.. he tries to drive her out at first as he has gotten used to the peace and quiet,, but she is spunky and won't go quietly. the two seem to get along with each other after a while and so they agree on a truce of sorts. later on her finances are dwindling and she needs to raise money , so the captain agrees to let her write his autobiography.. , there is also a man in the picture a live one who wants the young lady and now has to contend with the ghost,, I thought this was a very good movie,, I didn't need any action,, didn't need that many scares either,, I think there were a few,, but overall I enjoyed the picture very well,, as it was told well, and the story had good pacing and moved along quickly so you the viewer were never bored.

    This is a rewarding genre spanning film that combines elements of mystery, drama, humor, and romance in a uniquely compelling way. Gene Tierney is simply gorgeous in the title role of Mrs. Muir, while Rex Harrison's bombast as the ghostly sea captain mellows over time to engage his house guest as a worthy companion and suitor. It's intriguing that the story never goes in the direction of creating some sort of sexual tension between the principals. It's all believably platonic, with the interjection of a suitable cad (George Sanders) to woo Mrs. Muir in a relationship destined for failure. Depending on your approach, the film can be interpreted on many levels. Was Mrs. Muir's ghost a figment of her imagination, a dream, or some other unexplained phenomenon? One's own interpretation may change upon subsequent viewings. I've seen this picture a couple of times and found it to be a rewarding film with rich dialog, crisp photography and a wonderful Bernard Herrmann score to capture the ethereal mood.

    "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" is a supernatural fantasy film of a type which was popular in the forties; other American examples include "I Married a Witch", "Heaven Can Wait" (which also starred Gene Tierney), "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Portrait of Jennie". There were also British equivalents such as "Blithe Spirit" (which also starred Rex Harrison), "A Matter of Life and Death" and "Pandora and the Flying Dutchman" (this latter being from the early fifties). The film can, alternatively, be though of as a romantic comedy. Most rom-coms deal with the story of how a couple overcome an obstacle to their love, and in this case the obstacle seems a formidable one indeed- one of them is alive, the other dead. Although the film was shot entirely in California, it is set in Edwardian England. Lucy Muir, a beautiful young widow, moves into a seaside cottage with her young daughter Anna and her maid Martha. She discovers that the house is haunted by the ghost of its former owner, a sea captain named Daniel Gregg. Daniel initially seems like a difficult, testy character, but he soon shows that he has a decent, kindly side to his nature. When Lucy gets into financial difficulties he saves the day by dictating to her his memoirs of his seafaring life and allowing her to publish them and collect the royalties; when the book becomes a bestseller, Lucy becomes a wealthy woman. Lucy and the ghostly Daniel fall in love, but realise that theirs is a hopeless situation, and Lucy forms an attachment to Miles Fairley, a writer of children's stories. There were a number of contenders for the title of "most beautiful film star of the forties" (Ava Gardner, Jennifer Jones, Ingrid Bergman, Rita Hayworth, Lana Turner, Veronica Lake and others), but had I been a judge in a hypothetical "Miss Hollywood" contest, my vote would have gone to Gene Tierney. Although her British accent is not always spot-on, the lovely Gene makes an absolutely adorable heroine here. Rex Harrison (generally at his best in comedy, although he could also be good in serious films like "The Agony and the Ecstasy") gives a good performance as the salty old seadog Daniel, playing him as a likable rogue. George Sanders was always a good villain, and here plays Miles as a suave but oily charmer; it comes as no surprise when (like a number of characters played by Sanders) he turns out to be an utter cad. There is also a good contribution from Edna Best as Martha; the young Anna is played by an eight-year-old Natalie Wood. (Like Elizabeth Taylor, Natalie was to become so famous as an adult that one forgets she started her career as a child star). I would not rate "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" quite as highly as films like "It's a Wonderful Life" or "A Matter of Life and Death", both of which have a greater depth and rank among the best films of the forties, but it is nevertheless a very enjoyable light fantasies. And, as in all the best rom-coms, there is eventually to be a happy ending of sorts. 7/10

    A classic, by definition, is something that cannot be improved, and one could hardly wring more old time charm out of a picture than this one does. Rex Harrison is great as the ghost of a cantankerous sea captain who haunts the seaside house of widow Gene Tierney. He makes an unlikely but compelling romantic figure and soon the mismatched couple fall in love despite the obvious handicap that Harrison is already dead. This is Old School Hollywood 200 proof moonshine to be sure - the production design and costumes seem quite posh for a young widow of supposedly limited means - but everything is so carefully contrived to manipulate the audience to rally emotionally around the unlikely twosome that a little extra prettying up just makes for an even more watchable experience.

    It's the turn of the century. Gene Tierney is the beautiful widow, Mrs. Muir. More or less thrown out by her priggish older sisters she moves into Gull House, a lonely cottage on the coast, with her young daughter and her accommodating maid. It's a charming, two-story place with a large window and balcony overlooking the foaming breakers, filled with the nautical flotsam of the previous owner, a ship's captain who died at sea. It quickly becomes evident that the place is haunted by the misogynistic captain, Rex Harrison in a dark skipper's uniform and a devilish beard. Only Tierney can see and hear him. She overcomes her initial fear and the two begin to chat in a friendlier manner, although Harrison is always gruff and she is constantly complaining about his blasted language. But she's running out of money. Harrison wants her to keep the cottage and so he helps her write his spicy biography, although hardly anyone can believe she's written such a blasted good, rattling tale. She spurns George Sanders, a caddish seducer (what else?), and gets to keep the cottage, but Harrison disappears for good. Her little daughter grows up into Vanessa Brown, gets married, and Tierney and her maid are left in an empty nest. When she dies, Harrison reappears, takes Tierney's visible spirit by the hand, and they stroll off into the setting sun with quiet smiles. Sounds emetic, doesn't it? It sounds like the kind of movie that, if you're not careful, with either have you puking or experiencing a "wetting accident" during a fit of laughter. However, it's actually pretty moody and well done, despite the sappy-sounding story. Gene Tierney, never a dynamic actress, gets the job done nicely hear and looks supernally gorgeous, even in her old age, with that bit of powdery white flour brushed delicately into her hair. Rex Harrison does well by the role of ship's captain, even when he begins to melt slightly and treats her less like a habitant of the forecastle and more like the spirited woman she is, even taking to calling her "M'dear." No viewer would want anyone but Sanders for the role of the cad. He was perfection itself by 1947. And the supporting roles, even the minor ones, are affecting. Vanessa Brown was a pretty woman and Edna Best is Martha, the stalwart and sympathetic maid. It's certainly one of Bernard Hermann's better scores. Not as startling as "Vertigo" but a vast improvement over his BROOP-BROOP science fiction scores. It underlines the breath of mystery and slight melancholy that surrounds the place. You can almost taste the salt in the breeze. Trust me, men. Unless "Rambo II" is your idea of a splendid cinematic experience -- try this. You might like it.

    Gene Tierney plays Lucy Muir, a widow who decides to leave London where she has been living with her late husband's mother and sister, and move to a remote cottage by the sea. However, the cottage is haunted by the ghost of the former owner, the gruff sea captain Daniel Gregg (Rex Harrison). After an initial period of antagonism, the ghost and Mrs Muir start to have feelings for each other  but can two people from different worlds ever have a happy ending? This is a really charming movie (which spawned a subsequent television series), which combines mystery, romance and gentle comedy. Rex Harrison was a very talented actor, but never one who I could warm to. Here though, he is lovely and incredibly attractive. He plays the part of Captain Gregg very well  Gregg is brash and blunt, but he also has a capacity for empathy, and wants to protect Mrs Muir. Gene Tierney is luminous as the feisty Mrs Muir, and really was perfect in the role. Lucy Muir was a terrific character, and I felt for and admired her character, wishing for a happy life for her. The storyline is very sweet, and although I have no belief whatsoever in the ghosts or spirits, it never seemed ridiculous. There are loads of special little moments which add humour and poignancy to the story. I'm not giving away the ending, but I did think that it was perfect. The supporting cast were great  Edna Best as Martha, Lucy's maid; George Sanders as Miles Fairley, a very much alive man who romances Lucy Muir; and Natalie Wood (yes, that Natalie Wood) and Vanessa Brown as Mrs Muir's daughter Anna (Wood plays Anna as a child and Brown plays her as an adult). However, the film is all about the two lead characters, who have wonderful chemistry. Finally, a note on Bernand Herrman's very beautiful scorethe music in this film is wonderful, adding dramatic tension, and a tender atmosphere to the film. I often don't notice the music in a film (unless it is a musical), but the score here deserves the viewer's attention. All in all, a very enjoyable, sweet and not-at-all scary film.

    The word that best describes Rex Harrison as the Ghost is dynamic and Gene Tierney as Lucy Muir is innocently beautiful in favorable way. Both the Ghost and Mrs Muir compliment & compensate each other. People who would think this movie is too dreary to watch is like judging a book by its cover. This movie has a winning combination with touch of drama, somewhat spooky, a bit comical, but mostly romantic. Only when the Ghost is active or Mrs Muir is interacting with the Ghost are the parts I like best. This is the kind of movie I could watch over and over. The 1968-1970 TV series doesn't even compare to this timeless masterpiece.

    I absolutely love this film. It is so beautiful, haunting and somewhat poignant too. The Ghost and Mrs Muir hasn't dated I don't think, the cinematography is very fluid and beautiful and the sets and costumes are sumptuous. And the pacing is just fine, it adds to the haunting and poignant atmosphere. I also want to mention Bernard Hermann's score, it is truly outstanding and one of his best. And the story is wonderfully told with a great atmosphere, while the script is beautifully written especially the Captain's scene in the bedroom when he announces he is going away which not only gave me goosebumps but made me cry as well. The direction is spot-on, as is the acting. Rex Harrison is just superb as the ghostly Captain, gruff at first but he is quite sensitive as well. Gene Tierney- so entrancing in Laura- was a truly beautiful actress, and she looks lovely here and acts beautifully too, while George Sanders is quite dashing as Miles. Overall, an amazing film and I think it is worthy of a little more attention than it has. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    This movie is so dear to me. I first watched it with my mom when I was very young. She loved it, and I did too. The older I get, the more beautiful I realize this movie is. All of you young'uns brought up on "chick flicks" give this movie a watch and see what real grown-up men and women act like. Rex Harrison was never more handsome or charming, and that's saying a good deal! Gene Tierney was impossibly beautiful and hits just the right tone in her interpretation of this role. The score by Bernard Herrmann is gorgeous - somehow it reminds me of the score from Vertigo, which I also love. The film itself is gorgeously photographed. And choke me up? Oh, my gosh - when he leaves her, and laments "...What we've missed...what we've both missed." I defy you not to cry.

    The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947) What do you call this kind of contrivance, a situation set up by a fabulous circumstance, and then the inevitable unwinding of those circumstances? It's so artificial you want to scream for some sincerity, and yet it's so sincere, within its artifice, you are convinced, and intrigued. So here's the set-up. A widow moves to a house overlooking the ocean haunted by the ghost of a seaman who once lived there. And she decides she likes it, or wants it. And so we have the ghost in the form of Rex Harrison, and Mrs. Muir, the woman played with usual cool poise and cinematic good looks by Gene Tierney. The two don't quite fall in love at first, but a relationship grows, and a book is written. But that is just still the set-up. Mrs. Muir needs more that a pretend reality and a make-believe boyfriend. In comes a charming and somewhat dubious (at first) writer and painter played by George Sander. Conflicts arise, ideals are threatened, and the sky broods. It's a U.S. production but it is set in Britain (ostensibly) and has a very British, conversational feel. (Sanders and Harrison are British, of course, but Tierney is a Brooklyn girl. All of this is mostly amusing. Yes, American director Joseph L. Mankiewicz has made what almost feels at times like a romantic comedy, though more romance than laughs, especially after the first half. The set-up dilutes the impact of both the comedy and the drama a little.

So as good as all of this actually is, and as entertaining, it doesn't rip your heart out. And isn't that the idea? Maybe not always. It does move as much as it tickles. Its mystery is a little restrained, but it's still mysterious. It feels a bit literary at times, controlled and clever. But the actors, all three of them, fit that notion of sounding literate, and speaking clearly, of projecting never-ending poise. In the end, it's Gene Tierney's movie, and she holds it all together through its three distinct phases of the plot. By the last (fourth) brief section, the emotional threads pull together and it becomes a real tear-jerker for a few seconds. Which is plenty.

This movie has a winning combination with touch of drama, somewhat spooky, a bit comical, but mostly romantic. Only when the Ghost is active or Mrs Muir is interacting with the Ghost are the parts I like best. This is the kind of movie I could watch over and over. The 1968-1970 TV series doesn't even compare to this timeless masterpiece.

    I absolutely love this film. It is so beautiful, haunting and somewhat poignant too. The Ghost and Mrs Muir hasn't dated I don't think, the cinematography is very fluid and beautiful and the sets and costumes are sumptuous. And the pacing is just fine, it adds to the haunting and poignant atmosphere. I also want to mention Bernard Hermann's score, it is truly outstanding and one of his best. And the story is wonderfully told with a great atmosphere, while the script is beautifully written especially the Captain's scene in the bedroom when he announces he is going away which not only gave me goosebumps but made me cry as well. The direction is spot-on, as is the acting. Rex Harrison is just superb as the ghostly Captain, gruff at first but he is quite sensitive as well. Gene Tierney- so entrancing in Laura- was a truly beautiful actress, and she looks lovely here and acts beautifully too, while George Sanders is quite dashing as Miles. Overall, an amazing film and I think it is worthy of a little more attention than it has. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    This movie is so dear to me. I first watched it with my mom when I was very young. She loved it, and I did too. The older I get, the more beautiful I realize this movie is. All of you young'uns brought up on "chick flicks" give this movie a watch and see what real grown-up men and women act like. Rex Harrison was never more handsome or charming, and that's saying a good deal! Gene Tierney was impossibly beautiful and hits just the right tone in her interpretation of this role. The score by Bernard Herrmann is gorgeous - somehow it reminds me of the score from Vertigo, which I also love. The film itself is gorgeously photographed. And choke me up? Oh, my gosh - when he leaves her, and laments "...What we've missed...what we've both missed." I defy you not to cry.

    The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947) What do you call this kind of contrivance, a situation set up by a fabulous circumstance, and then the inevitable unwinding of those circumstances? It's so artificial you want to scream for some sincerity, and yet it's so sincere, within its artifice, you are convinced, and intrigued. So here's the set-up. A widow moves to a house overlooking the ocean haunted by the ghost of a seaman who once lived there. And she decides she likes it, or wants it. And so we have the ghost in the form of Rex Harrison, and Mrs. Muir, the woman played with usual cool poise and cinematic good looks by Gene Tierney. The two don't quite fall in love at first, but a relationship grows, and a book is written. But that is just still the set-up. Mrs. Muir needs more that a pretend reality and a make-believe boyfriend. In comes a charming and somewhat dubious (at first) writer and painter played by George Sander. Conflicts arise, ideals are threatened, and the sky broods. It's a U.S. production but it is set in Britain (ostensibly) and has a very British, conversational feel. (Sanders and Harrison are British, of course, but Tierney is a Brooklyn girl. All of this is mostly amusing. Yes, American director Joseph L. Mankiewicz has made what almost feels at times like a romantic comedy, though more romance than laughs, especially after the first half. The set-up dilutes the impact of both the comedy and the drama a little. A true madcap could survive this kind of dreamy falseness, but a romance, to really move you, can't keep tripping over little tricks in the plot, and in the filming. So as good as all of this actually is, and as entertaining, it doesn't rip your heart out. And isn't that the idea? Maybe not always. It does move as much as it tickles. Its mystery is a little restrained, but it's still mysterious. It feels a bit literary at times, controlled and clever. But the actors, all three of them, fit that notion of sounding literate, and speaking clearly, of projecting never-ending poise. In the end, it's Gene Tierney's movie, and she holds it all together through its three distinct phases of the plot. By the last (fourth) brief section, the emotional threads pull together and it becomes a real tear-jerker for a few seconds. Which is plenty.

    Natalie Wood, and Gene Tierney give wonderful performances in a classic haunting tale,, a woman writer moves into a haunted house by the sea to get some well needed rest and peace and quiet,, apparently the house is haunted by a ship's captain.. he tries to drive her out at first as he has gotten used to the peace and quiet,, but she is spunky and won't go quietly. the two seem to get along with each other after a while and so they agree on a truce of sorts. later on her finances are dwindling and she needs to raise money , so the captain agrees to let her write his autobiography.. , there is also a man in the picture a live one who wants the young lady and now has to contend with the ghost,, I thought this was a very good movie,, I didn't need any action,, didn't need that many scares either,, I think there were a few,, but overall I enjoyed the picture very well,, as it was told well, and the story had good pacing and moved along quickly so you the viewer were never bored.

    This is a rewarding genre spanning film that combines elements of mystery, drama, humor, and romance in a uniquely compelling way. Gene Tierney is simply gorgeous in the title role of Mrs. Muir, while Rex Harrison's bombast as the ghostly sea captain mellows over time to engage his house guest as a worthy companion and suitor. It's intriguing that the story never goes in the direction of creating some sort of sexual tension between the principals. It's all believably platonic, with the interjection of a suitable cad (George Sanders) to woo Mrs. Muir in a relationship destined for failure. Depending on your approach, the film can be interpreted on many levels. Was Mrs. Muir's ghost a figment of her imagination, a dream, or some other unexplained phenomenon? One's own interpretation may change upon subsequent viewings. I've seen this picture a couple of times and found it to be a rewarding film with rich dialog, crisp photography and a wonderful Bernard Herrmann score to capture the ethereal mood.

    "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" is a supernatural fantasy film of a type which was popular in the forties; other American examples include "I Married a Witch", "Heaven Can Wait" (which also starred Gene Tierney), "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Portrait of Jennie". There were also British equivalents such as "Blithe Spirit" (which also starred Rex Harrison), "A Matter of Life and Death" and "Pandora and the Flying Dutchman" (this latter being from the early fifties). The film can, alternatively, be though of as a romantic comedy. Most rom-coms deal with the story of how a couple overcome an obstacle to their love, and in this case the obstacle seems a formidable one indeed- one of them is alive, the other dead. Although the film was shot entirely in California, it is set in Edwardian England. Lucy Muir, a beautiful young widow, moves into a seaside cottage with her young daughter Anna and her maid Martha. She discovers that the house is haunted by the ghost of its former owner, a sea captain named Daniel Gregg. Daniel initially seems like a difficult, testy character, but he soon shows that he has a decent, kindly side to his nature. When Lucy gets into financial difficulties he saves the day by dictating to her his memoirs of his seafaring life and allowing her to publish them and collect the royalties; when the book becomes a bestseller, Lucy becomes a wealthy woman. Lucy and the ghostly Daniel fall in love, but realise that theirs is a hopeless situation, and Lucy forms an attachment to Miles Fairley, a writer of children's stories. There were a number of contenders for the title of "most beautiful film star of the forties" (Ava Gardner, Jennifer Jones, Ingrid Bergman, Rita Hayworth, Lana Turner, Veronica Lake and others), but had I been a judge in a hypothetical "Miss Hollywood" contest, my vote would have gone to Gene Tierney. Although her British accent is not always spot-on, the lovely Gene makes an absolutely adorable heroine here. Rex Harrison (generally at his best in comedy, although he could also be good in serious films like "The Agony and the Ecstasy") gives a good performance as the salty old seadog Daniel, playing him as a likable rogue. George Sanders was always a good villain, and here plays Miles as a suave but oily charmer; it comes as no surprise when (like a number of characters played by Sanders) he turns out to be an utter cad. There is also a good contribution from Edna Best as Martha; the young Anna is played by an eight-year-old Natalie Wood. (Like Elizabeth Taylor, Natalie was to become so famous as an adult that one forgets she started her career as a child star). I would not rate "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" quite as highly as films like "It's a Wonderful Life" or "A Matter of Life and Death", both of which have a greater depth and rank among the best films of the forties, but it is nevertheless a very enjoyable light fantasies. And, as in all the best rom-coms, there is eventually to be a happy ending of sorts. 7/10

    A classic, by definition, is something that cannot be improved, and one could hardly wring more old time charm out of a picture than this one does. Rex Harrison is great as the ghost of a cantankerous sea captain who haunts the seaside house of widow Gene Tierney. He makes an unlikely but compelling romantic figure and soon the mismatched couple fall in love despite the obvious handicap that Harrison is already dead. This is Old School Hollywood 200 proof moonshine to be sure - the production design and costumes seem quite posh for a young widow of supposedly limited means - but everything is so carefully contrived to manipulate the audience to rally emotionally around the unlikely twosome that a little extra prettying up just makes for an even more watchable experience.

    It's the turn of the century. Gene Tierney is the beautiful widow, Mrs. Muir. More or less thrown out by her priggish older sisters she moves into Gull House, a lonely cottage on the coast, with her young daughter and her accommodating maid. It's a charming, two-story place with a large window and balcony overlooking the foaming breakers, filled with the nautical flotsam of the previous owner, a ship's captain who died at sea. It quickly becomes evident that the place is haunted by the misogynistic captain, Rex Harrison in a dark skipper's uniform and a devilish beard. Only Tierney can see and hear him. She overcomes her initial fear and the two begin to chat in a friendlier manner, although Harrison is always gruff and she is constantly complaining about his blasted language. But she's running out of money. Harrison wants her to keep the cottage and so he helps her write his spicy biography, although hardly anyone can believe she's written such a blasted good, rattling tale. She spurns George Sanders, a caddish seducer (what else?), and gets to keep the cottage, but Harrison disappears for good. Her little daughter grows up into Vanessa Brown, gets married, and Tierney and her maid are left in an empty nest. When she dies, Harrison reappears, takes Tierney's visible spirit by the hand, and they stroll off into the setting sun with quiet smiles. Sounds emetic, doesn't it? It sounds like the kind of movie that, if you're not careful, with either have you puking or experiencing a "wetting accident" during a fit of laughter. However, it's actually pretty moody and well done, despite the sappy-sounding story. Gene Tierney, never a dynamic actress, gets the job done nicely hear and looks supernally gorgeous, even in her old age, with that bit of powdery white flour brushed delicately into her hair. Rex Harrison does well by the role of ship's captain, even when he begins to melt slightly and treats her less like a habitant of the forecastle and more like the spirited woman she is, even taking to calling her "M'dear." No viewer would want anyone but Sanders for the role of the cad. He was perfection itself by 1947. And the supporting roles, even the minor ones, are affecting. Vanessa Brown was a pretty woman and Edna Best is Martha, the stalwart and sympathetic maid. It's certainly one of Bernard Hermann's better scores. Not as startling as "Vertigo" but a vast improvement over his BROOP-BROOP science fiction scores. It underlines the breath of mystery and slight melancholy that surrounds the place. You can almost taste the salt in the breeze. Trust me, men. Unless "Rambo II" is your idea of a splendid cinematic experience -- try this. You might like it.

    Gene Tierney plays Lucy Muir, a widow who decides to leave London where she has been living with her late husband's mother and sister, and move to a remote cottage by the sea. However, the cottage is haunted by the ghost of the former owner, the gruff sea captain Daniel Gregg (Rex Harrison). After an initial period of antagonism, the ghost and Mrs Muir start to have feelings for each other  but can two people from different worlds ever have a happy ending? This is a really charming movie (which spawned a subsequent television series), which combines mystery, romance and gentle comedy. Rex Harrison was a very talented actor, but never one who I could warm to. Here though, he is lovely and incredibly attractive. He plays the part of Captain Gregg very well  Gregg is brash and blunt, but he also has a capacity for empathy, and wants to protect Mrs Muir. Gene Tierney is luminous as the feisty Mrs Muir, and really was perfect in the role. Lucy Muir was a terrific character, and I felt for and admired her character, wishing for a happy life for her. The storyline is very sweet, and although I have no belief whatsoever in the ghosts or spirits, it never seemed ridiculous. There are loads of special little moments which add humour and poignancy to the story. I'm not giving away the ending, but I did think that it was perfect. The supporting cast were great  Edna Best as Martha, Lucy's maid; George Sanders as Miles Fairley, a very much alive man who romances Lucy Muir; and Natalie Wood (yes, that Natalie Wood) and Vanessa Brown as Mrs Muir's daughter Anna (Wood plays Anna as a child and Brown plays her as an adult). However, the film is all about the two lead characters, who have wonderful chemistry. Finally, a note on Bernand Herrman's very beautiful scorethe music in this film is wonderful, adding dramatic tension, and a tender atmosphere to the film. I often don't notice the music in a film (unless it is a musical), but the score here deserves the viewer's attention. All in all, a very enjoyable, sweet and not-at-all scary film.
