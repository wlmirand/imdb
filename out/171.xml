 <sinopse>
  Post-apocalyptic surrealist black comedy about the landlord of an apartment building who occasionally prepares a delicacy for his odd tenants.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The story is centered on a microcosm of a post-apocalyptic society where food is so rare it's invaluable and is used as currency. The story centers on an apartment building with a delicatessen on the ground floor. The owner of the eatery also owns the apartment building and he is in need of a new maintenance man since the original "mysteriously" disappeared. A former clown applies for the job and the butcher's intent is to have him work for a little while and then serve him to quirky tenants who pay the butcher in, of course, grain. The clown and butcher's daughter fall in love and she tries to foil her father's plans by contacting the "troglodytes", a grain eating sub-group of society who live entirely underground. The "trogs" are possibly the most sensible of the lot, as they see food as food and not money.

    This French cult movie is a somewhat unusual take on the cannibal film. Set exclusively in an apartment block in a post-apocalyptic city. Food is in very short supply and the butcher/landlord rules the roost. It seems that he is chopping up unsuspecting guests and selling their meat on to his impoverished tenants. One day an ex-circus clown moves in and unwittingly becomes the next target of the butcher. This is a Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro film. Like their other features like The Bunker of the Last Gunshots and The City of the Lost Children, this one also is set in a post-apocalyptic world of extremely vague origins. All their films thrust the viewer into such an alternate world but don't tell them quite why things are like the way they are. Visually, Delicatessen follows the same specific aesthetic as the others too, with an earthy brown and green colour scheme and a retro styling. The apartment block and dress of the inhabitants all recall a much earlier age, yet the setting is clearly in the future. Or is it really simply an alternate world? It's up to the viewer to decide. Whatever the case, this is another visually intricate work, with very detailed set design. There is a lot of consideration taken in creating the surreal world. This also extends to the characterisations too, such as the eccentric man played by Howard Vernon who lives in a dank cellar with a host of frogs and snails for company or the suicidal woman who conceives highly elaborate plans for ending her life, all of which fail for various reasons. You can probably guess from this that the humour is of the dark variety but there are many light comic moments too, such as the excellent scene where various tenants inadvertently create a rhythmical musical number simply by going about their day to day business. There really are a lot of different things to enjoy in this highly inventive comedy.

    Before the colorful dreamworld of "Amelie" caught the worlds' attention, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro unleashed their incredible talents for story telling through originally entertaining vignettes in a post-apocalyptic pre-vegetarian France. From the tasty opening sequence and credits you know the Delicatessen style of black humor with charming attention to detail that leaves its' movie cousin"Brazil" as simply idealistic while this as an exacting humorous story of survival. Focused in a dilapidated apartment complex owned by the butcher (who's shop is below), you better pay your rent! As always, Jeunets' cast of characters keeps your attention while the standard of French humor, sin: pride, food and sex, develop.

    "Delicatessen" marks Jean-Pierre Jeunet's and Marc Caro's first film and it hit like a bomb. While despised by some, it even represents the reinvention of French cinema with new means to others, is the pathfinder of a new avant-garde, which would peak with Jeunet's later "Amelie". Well, "Delicatessen" for sure is an exalting, one-of-a-kind trip into a fantastic, twisted retro-future reality, a very unique dark comedy, quirky in all places, uncompromising in every respect. Indeed, the creative duo behind the project made exactly what they wanted to do - Jeunet, the guy who started off as a director of TV commercials and Caro, the designer/artist with the eye for the extraordinary out-of-place stuff. What is central in this kind of movie is that form dominates over content - to such an extreme degree at times that the narrative might suffer, but it is all embedded in a constantly turning kaleidoscope of impressions that sweeps the viewer with it. Everything is different, mysterious, weird in this surreal setting of a post-apocalyptic apartment building where a butcher hunts for human meat, where grain replaces money, underground living troglodytes plan a revolution and a retired clown enjoys playing the saw. "Delicatessen", while very original, still quotes other movies in a lot of places, and is quoted regularly since its release, clearly showing its impact as a true postmodern phenomenon. Unforgettable are moments like when the whole house suddenly begins to follow a rhythm thanks to noises traveling through its pipes, or when a closer look is necessary at one of the beds to determine a problematic spring. Sounds difficult to imagine why these are classic moments? Well, one needs to see the realization to become a believer. Or learn why to reject it. Because Jeunet movies are as he describes it best himself: Fish, not meat, and you need to be a fish person. At any rate, even if you applaud to Jeunet's resourcefulness: Enjoy him in doses!

    I'm not sure what anyone thinks of when they hear the genre surrealist black comedy. I know I had no idea what to expect from that when reading it in Delicatessen's synopsis. But after watching it I would have to agree. Delicatessen is just that. It's surreal, dark, and twistedly funny. It's the very first film from artsy French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and one of two collaborations between him and Marc Caro. Dominique Pinon, a Jeunet regular, stars as Louison, a clown who moves into an apartment building run by a fat lard of a landlord who also happens to be a butcher. Louison begins to fall in love with the landlord's daughter, Julie, and this stirs up a lot of trouble in this run down little apartment which is full of bizarre characters and is also smack dab in the middle of a post apocalyptic hellscape. What more could you want? Delicatessen is an odd film to watch. I honestly don't know what any of it means and I'm still piecing together what I just watched, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a great time watching it. It's incredibly strange, funny in a devilish and stomach churning kind of way, the kind of humor that you're not sure you should be laughing at, or you're a little afraid to laugh at. For some viewers it might just be a little too weird, but for those who know what they're watching it's nothing short of freaking awesome. Delicatessen is a visual treat that is cruel to the senses. It's creepy and confusing to watch, but you can't help but enjoy it. Nothing is normal in this film, hence the surreal aspect to it, and there's only a weak strand of reality running through this topsy turvy flick. But every aspect of the film fits this crazy mixed up world Jeunet and Caro have created. Everything from the odd scenery that all seems out of place, to the collection of strangely twisted characters that inhabit the apartment, it all fits right in with this world that makes absolutely no sense. Delicatessen is as funny as it is creepy and as entertaining as it is fascinating. As far as analyzing the film goes I'm lost, but I can definitely say that I enjoyed every minute of it. There's a lot about this film to still be deciphered, but that will have to come at a later date after many more viewings of this exceptionally strange film.

    Delicatessen is the second movie of Jean-Pierre Jeunet I'm watching after the notable "Amelie" and this movie really explains that the director's imagination is boundless. May be like Terry Gilliam who is famous for Twelve Monkeys, Brazil etc  The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world based on a butcher (Clapet) who owns an apartment, a new helper(Louison), a circus performer and its tenants, each one of them is hilariously weird. In a world where there is a scarcity of food and it is used as currency, cannibalism has become a way of survival. Clapet fishes people with an advertisement for a helper job and Louison arrives there. Clapet and his tenants planning to feast Louison is the plot. The love between Clapet's daughter and Louison is tender and sweet. Darius Khondji, cinematographer of the movie has done a fabulous job. And editing of the movie is also noteworthy. The title part of the movie is so creative and intriguing. Delicatessen is not a normal film but a dark comedy, weirdly filmed and is very funny at times. Worthwhile!!!

    As far as style goes, this is almost without parallel. Jeunet's own 'Amelie' has moments of very similar style shots and humour and Gilliam's 'Brazil' has some of the zanyness and other world quality of it but other than that, it's more or less on it's own as an example of off-beat hard to pigeonhole non mainstream film. It's a comedy, a dark(ish) post apocalyptic drama, an art house movie, a love story. It touches on horror at times and seems to tick so many boxes, yet doesn't sit in any one of them. Few films manage that so well. The lighting is inventive and the sets are incredible. Even the subtle change of colour tone at the end, perhaps suggesting that everything will be alright now, cleverly plays on the subconscious and beautifully lightens the whole mood of the film at it's close. The wonderfully comic timed spring mattress duet that Louison and Mme Plusse share and Aurore's tragically pathetic attempts to kill herself which only succeed when she doesn't want to do it anymore are shining moments in the comedy of Delicatessen. The militant vegetarians who attempt the rescue and the old self sufficient man living in a flooded apartment with frogs and snails growing wild, providing him with a ready source of food are just part of the absurdity and yet wonder of a film that delights and amazes in equal measures. Truly a great film and to paraphrase a review of The Wire (TV's greatest ever series), I would seriously suggest that "you either love it or you haven't seen it yet"

    Delicatessen looks like a series of sepia tone paintings brought to life in this off beat comedy from Jean Pierre Jeunet. This is one of the strangest, quirkiest films I've ever seen. Jeunet's previous works, Amelie(2009) and Micmacs(2009) were also different but they at least had coherent story lines, Delicatessen does not. It is without structure of any kind. The landlord and butcher of an apartment building and deli in some kind of post apocalyptic France with a food shortage is also a butcher who serves customers meat from a mysterious source. He hires a former circus performer to be a handy man. What follows is good acting wasted by surrealism which tired me out by the end, A very disappointing effort by Mr. Jeunet.

    This is a French movie by the director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and somebody else. Jeunet recently did Alien Resurrection, but that movie is nothing like this one. Delicatessen appears to be a rather low-budget movie. It has no great special effects or dazzling cinematography, but it is brilliant none-the-less. Delicatessen is about an apartment block in a post-apocalyptic Earth. At the bottom of this apartment block is a delicatessen where the butcher sells human meat, and he gets this meat from the people that live in the building. Then a nice man named Louisan comes to the apartment for a job and falls in love with the butcher's daughter Julie. The problem is that Louisan is the next person on the list to be cut up and sold. This movie comes under the classification of foreign movie. There is nothing deep and insightful in it, other than the barbarity of man. That is, in a time where there is no food, humanity will resort to cannibalism to survive. What makes this movie unique though is the characters. The French seem to excel in making brilliant characters. Where the Americans will put serious characters in silly situations, the French put silly characters in serious situations. My favourite is when the trogs kidnapped the wrong woman and then have an argument as to whether she is male or not. Then they realise she is not male so run off leaving her tied up. One then comes back, unties her, kisses her and says "that's in case I don't come back," Okay, you might not think its that funny, but the movie is. American movies tend to have the problem of having the first ten minutes hilarious and then the rest of it is ordinary. The French movies start rather ordinary and the comedy tends to last. It usually is because the characters are just so well done, and they remain in character right through. Delicatessen is just great if you want to see a decent comedy. It is French, and it is much better than a lot of American movies I have seen.

    Almost from the start, with the closeups of fat faces in very strange expressions, I sensed that I had seen the style elsewhere. Then I realized that this movie reminded me of Amelie. Sure enough, it is the same director although this was made about a decade earlier. Amelie is one of my favorite movies; not just for the story but also for the unique imagery. This movie shares that unique visual style but in a more grotesque fashion. Faces are shown in closeup that border on nightmarish. Colors and atmosphere meld to form a bleak, murky, misty and dreary filmscape. It is at once charming and horrifying. One of my favorite scenes is when Louison (Dominique Pinon) is blowing bubbles in the hallway. The two mischievous boys (or "young rascals" played by Boban Janevski and Mikael Todde) are immediately entranced and Louison is spared from any future harassment from them. Indeed, at one point they save his life with their mischief on others. Another of my favorite scenes is when Louison and Juliet (Marie-Loure Dougnat) are playing a duet, she on the cello, he on the saw(?!). Together with the music it was a magic moment. In fact, whenever Louison is shown clowning around, the music is soft and whimsical. Another wonderful moment is when Louison and the Butcher's lover (Karin Viard) are unintentionally playing a song from squeaky mattress springs. In another scene, she and Louison are dancing in his apartment. It looks well enough until you notice that Louison has 3 legs giving new meaning to having 2 left feet. These delightful moments are a stark contrast to the rest of the film. I guess I should expound on what the movie is about. Louison is an out of work clown whose partner has been eaten. He tries to get a job as a handyman for a butcher (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) who is also a tenement owner. The butcher sizes him up and is not sure he will do. He thinks Louison is a bit too scrawny. However, Louison's luggage is all over the street so he gets the job just to clear the way. It would have been better had he not because in an earlier scene, you see someone hiding in a trash can and then getting butchered as the screen goes black. That someone was the last handyman. This movie is set in a post apocalyptic future where food is scarce and indeed, grain has become currency. The world has become divided between those that live underground and still use grain as food instead of currency and those that hoard grain and eat... well, anything else they can get their hands on except grain. I don't think I've ever seen a blacker comedy than this but if you enjoyed Amelie, I think you will also like this movie.

    I watched this movie because of its very high rating, expecting a very funny comedy in an odd and magic environment. as practically everybody says, yes, the settings are beautiful and fun to watch. but I didn't start this movie to be looking at a grotesque diashow with music, but for the "comedy". unfortunately, there is not a single funny thing inside this movie. everything is exaggerated, but that is not enough to be a "comedy". it's just a parody of real life. and NOT funny at all. ach, and the story is very weak and boring. cinematography and atmosphere: 10 story: 1 Comedy: 1 actors: 6

    Delicatessen looks like a series of sepia tone paintings brought to life in this off beat comedy from Jean Pierre Jeunet. This is one of the strangest, quirkiest films I've ever seen. Jeunet's previous works, Amelie(2009) and Micmacs(2009) were also different but they at least had coherent story lines, Delicatessen does not. It is without structure of any kind. The landlord and butcher of an apartment building and deli in some kind of post apocalyptic France with a food shortage is also a butcher who serves customers meat from a mysterious source. He hires a former circus performer to be a handy man. What follows is good acting wasted by surrealism which tired me out by the end, A very disappointing effort by Mr. Jeunet.

    This is a French movie by the director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and somebody else. Jeunet recently did Alien Resurrection, but that movie is nothing like this one. Delicatessen appears to be a rather low-budget movie. It has no great special effects or dazzling cinematography, but it is brilliant none-the-less. Delicatessen is about an apartment block in a post-apocalyptic Earth. At the bottom of this apartment block is a delicatessen where the butcher sells human meat, and he gets this meat from the people that live in the building. Then a nice man named Louisan comes to the apartment for a job and falls in love with the butcher's daughter Julie. The problem is that Louisan is the next person on the list to be cut up and sold. This movie comes under the classification of foreign movie. There is nothing deep and insightful in it, other than the barbarity of man. That is, in a time where there is no food, humanity will resort to cannibalism to survive. What makes this movie unique though is the characters. The French seem to excel in making brilliant characters. Where the Americans will put serious characters in silly situations, the French put silly characters in serious situations. My favourite is when the trogs kidnapped the wrong woman and then have an argument as to whether she is male or not. Then they realise she is not male so run off leaving her tied up. One then comes back, unties her, kisses her and says "that's in case I don't come back," Okay, you might not think its that funny, but the movie is. American movies tend to have the problem of having the first ten minutes hilarious and then the rest of it is ordinary. The French movies start rather ordinary and the comedy tends to last. It usually is because the characters are just so well done, and they remain in character right through. Delicatessen is just great if you want to see a decent comedy. It is French, and it is much better than a lot of American movies I have seen.

    Almost from the start, with the closeups of fat faces in very strange expressions, I sensed that I had seen the style elsewhere. Then I realized that this movie reminded me of Amelie. Sure enough, it is the same director although this was made about a decade earlier. Amelie is one of my favorite movies; not just for the story but also for the unique imagery. This movie shares that unique visual style but in a more grotesque fashion. Faces are shown in closeup that border on nightmarish. Colors and atmosphere meld to form a bleak, murky, misty and dreary filmscape. It is at once charming and horrifying. One of my favorite scenes is when Louison (Dominique Pinon) is blowing bubbles in the hallway. The two mischievous boys (or "young rascals" played by Boban Janevski and Mikael Todde) are immediately entranced and Louison is spared from any future harassment from them. Indeed, at one point they save his life with their mischief on others. Another of my favorite scenes is when Louison and Juliet (Marie-Loure Dougnat) are playing a duet, she on the cello, he on the saw(?!). Together with the music it was a magic moment. In fact, whenever Louison is shown clowning around, the music is soft and whimsical. Another wonderful moment is when Louison and the Butcher's lover (Karin Viard) are unintentionally playing a song from squeaky mattress springs. In another scene, she and Louison are dancing in his apartment. It looks well enough until you notice that Louison has 3 legs giving new meaning to having 2 left feet. These delightful moments are a stark contrast to the rest of the film. I guess I should expound on what the movie is about. Louison is an out of work clown whose partner has been eaten. He tries to get a job as a handyman for a butcher (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) who is also a tenement owner. The butcher sizes him up and is not sure he will do. He thinks Louison is a bit too scrawny. However, Louison's luggage is all over the street so he gets the job just to clear the way. It would have been better had he not because in an earlier scene, you see someone hiding in a trash can and then getting butchered as the screen goes black. That someone was the last handyman. This movie is set in a post apocalyptic future where food is scarce and indeed, grain has become currency. The world has become divided between those that live underground and still use grain as food instead of currency and those that hoard grain and eat... well, anything else they can get their hands on except grain. I don't think I've ever seen a blacker comedy than this but if you enjoyed Amelie, I think you will also like this movie.

    I watched this movie because of its very high rating, expecting a very funny comedy in an odd and magic environment. as practically everybody says, yes, the settings are beautiful and fun to watch. but I didn't start this movie to be looking at a grotesque diashow with music, but for the "comedy". unfortunately, there is not a single funny thing inside this movie. everything is exaggerated, but that is not enough to be a "comedy". it's just a parody of real life. and NOT funny at all. ach, and the story is very weak and boring. cinematography and atmosphere: 10 story: 1 Comedy: 1 actors: 6

    This French cult movie is a somewhat unusual take on the cannibal film. Set exclusively in an apartment block in a post-apocalyptic city. Food is in very short supply and the butcher/landlord rules the roost. It seems that he is chopping up unsuspecting guests and selling their meat on to his impoverished tenants. One day an ex-circus clown moves in and unwittingly becomes the next target of the butcher. This is a Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro film. Like their other features like The Bunker of the Last Gunshots and The City of the Lost Children, this one also is set in a post-apocalyptic world of extremely vague origins. All their films thrust the viewer into such an alternate world but don't tell them quite why things are like the way they are. Visually, Delicatessen follows the same specific aesthetic as the others too, with an earthy brown and green colour scheme and a retro styling. The apartment block and dress of the inhabitants all recall a much earlier age, yet the setting is clearly in the future. Or is it really simply an alternate world? It's up to the viewer to decide. Whatever the case, this is another visually intricate work, with very detailed set design. There is a lot of consideration taken in creating the surreal world. This also extends to the characterisations too, such as the eccentric man played by Howard Vernon who lives in a dank cellar with a host of frogs and snails for company or the suicidal woman who conceives highly elaborate plans for ending her life, all of which fail for various reasons. You can probably guess from this that the humour is of the dark variety but there are many light comic moments too, such as the excellent scene where various tenants inadvertently create a rhythmical musical number simply by going about their day to day business. There really are a lot of different things to enjoy in this highly inventive comedy.

    Before the colorful dreamworld of "Amelie" caught the worlds' attention, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro unleashed their incredible talents for story telling through originally entertaining vignettes in a post-apocalyptic pre-vegetarian France. From the tasty opening sequence and credits you know the Delicatessen style of black humor with charming attention to detail that leaves its' movie cousin"Brazil" as simply idealistic while this as an exacting humorous story of survival. Focused in a dilapidated apartment complex owned by the butcher (who's shop is below), you better pay your rent! As always, Jeunets' cast of characters keeps your attention while the standard of French humor, sin: pride, food and sex, develop.

    "Delicatessen" marks Jean-Pierre Jeunet's and Marc Caro's first film and it hit like a bomb. While despised by some, it even represents the reinvention of French cinema with new means to others, is the pathfinder of a new avant-garde, which would peak with Jeunet's later "Amelie". Well, "Delicatessen" for sure is an exalting, one-of-a-kind trip into a fantastic, twisted retro-future reality, a very unique dark comedy, quirky in all places, uncompromising in every respect. Indeed, the creative duo behind the project made exactly what they wanted to do - Jeunet, the guy who started off as a director of TV commercials and Caro, the designer/artist with the eye for the extraordinary out-of-place stuff. What is central in this kind of movie is that form dominates over content - to such an extreme degree at times that the narrative might suffer, but it is all embedded in a constantly turning kaleidoscope of impressions that sweeps the viewer with it. Everything is different, mysterious, weird in this surreal setting of a post-apocalyptic apartment building where a butcher hunts for human meat, where grain replaces money, underground living troglodytes plan a revolution and a retired clown enjoys playing the saw. "Delicatessen", while very original, still quotes other movies in a lot of places, and is quoted regularly since its release, clearly showing its impact as a true postmodern phenomenon. Unforgettable are moments like when the whole house suddenly begins to follow a rhythm thanks to noises traveling through its pipes, or when a closer look is necessary at one of the beds to determine a problematic spring. Sounds difficult to imagine why these are classic moments? Well, one needs to see the realization to become a believer. Or learn why to reject it. Because Jeunet movies are as he describes it best himself: Fish, not meat, and you need to be a fish person. At any rate, even if you applaud to Jeunet's resourcefulness: Enjoy him in doses!

    I'm not sure what anyone thinks of when they hear the genre surrealist black comedy. I know I had no idea what to expect from that when reading it in Delicatessen's synopsis. But after watching it I would have to agree. Delicatessen is just that. It's surreal, dark, and twistedly funny. It's the very first film from artsy French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and one of two collaborations between him and Marc Caro. Dominique Pinon, a Jeunet regular, stars as Louison, a clown who moves into an apartment building run by a fat lard of a landlord who also happens to be a butcher. Louison begins to fall in love with the landlord's daughter, Julie, and this stirs up a lot of trouble in this run down little apartment which is full of bizarre characters and is also smack dab in the middle of a post apocalyptic hellscape. What more could you want? Delicatessen is an odd film to watch. I honestly don't know what any of it means and I'm still piecing together what I just watched, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a great time watching it. It's incredibly strange, funny in a devilish and stomach churning kind of way, the kind of humor that you're not sure you should be laughing at, or you're a little afraid to laugh at. For some viewers it might just be a little too weird, but for those who know what they're watching it's nothing short of freaking awesome. Delicatessen is a visual treat that is cruel to the senses. It's creepy and confusing to watch, but you can't help but enjoy it. Nothing is normal in this film, hence the surreal aspect to it, and there's only a weak strand of reality running through this topsy turvy flick. But every aspect of the film fits this crazy mixed up world Jeunet and Caro have created. Everything from the odd scenery that all seems out of place, to the collection of strangely twisted characters that inhabit the apartment, it all fits right in with this world that makes absolutely no sense. Delicatessen is as funny as it is creepy and as entertaining as it is fascinating. As far as analyzing the film goes I'm lost, but I can definitely say that I enjoyed every minute of it. There's a lot about this film to still be deciphered, but that will have to come at a later date after many more viewings of this exceptionally strange film.

    Delicatessen is the second movie of Jean-Pierre Jeunet I'm watching after the notable "Amelie" and this movie really explains that the director's imagination is boundless. May be like Terry Gilliam who is famous for Twelve Monkeys, Brazil etc  The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world based on a butcher (Clapet) who owns an apartment, a new helper(Louison), a circus performer and its tenants, each one of them is hilariously weird. In a world where there is a scarcity of food and it is used as currency, cannibalism has become a way of survival. Clapet fishes people with an advertisement for a helper job and Louison arrives there. Clapet and his tenants planning to feast Louison is the plot. The love between Clapet's daughter and Louison is tender and sweet. Darius Khondji, cinematographer of the movie has done a fabulous job. And editing of the movie is also noteworthy. The title part of the movie is so creative and intriguing. Delicatessen is not a normal film but a dark comedy, weirdly filmed and is very funny at times. Worthwhile!!!

    As far as style goes, this is almost without parallel. Jeunet's own 'Amelie' has moments of very similar style shots and humour and Gilliam's 'Brazil' has some of the zanyness and other world quality of it but other than that, it's more or less on it's own as an example of off-beat hard to pigeonhole non mainstream film. It's a comedy, a dark(ish) post apocalyptic drama, an art house movie, a love story. It touches on horror at times and seems to tick so many boxes, yet doesn't sit in any one of them. Few films manage that so well. The lighting is inventive and the sets are incredible. Even the subtle change of colour tone at the end, perhaps suggesting that everything will be alright now, cleverly plays on the subconscious and beautifully lightens the whole mood of the film at it's close. The wonderfully comic timed spring mattress duet that Louison and Mme Plusse share and Aurore's tragically pathetic attempts to kill herself which only succeed when she doesn't want to do it anymore are shining moments in the comedy of Delicatessen. The militant vegetarians who attempt the rescue and the old self sufficient man living in a flooded apartment with frogs and snails growing wild, providing him with a ready source of food are just part of the absurdity and yet wonder of a film that delights and amazes in equal measures. Truly a great film and to paraphrase a review of The Wire (TV's greatest ever series), I would seriously suggest that "you either love it or you haven't seen it yet"

For some viewers it might just be a little too weird, but for those who know what they're watching it's nothing short of freaking awesome. Delicatessen is a visual treat that is cruel to the senses. It's creepy and confusing to watch, but you can't help but enjoy it. Nothing is normal in this film, hence the surreal aspect to it, and there's only a weak strand of reality running through this topsy turvy flick. But every aspect of the film fits this crazy mixed up world Jeunet and Caro have created. Everything from the odd scenery that all seems out of place, to the collection of strangely twisted characters that inhabit the apartment, it all fits right in with this world that makes absolutely no sense. Delicatessen is as funny as it is creepy and as entertaining as it is fascinating. As far as analyzing the film goes I'm lost, but I can definitely say that I enjoyed every minute of it. There's a lot about this film to still be deciphered, but that will have to come at a later date after many more viewings of this exceptionally strange film.

    Delicatessen is the second movie of Jean-Pierre Jeunet I'm watching after the notable "Amelie" and this movie really explains that the director's imagination is boundless. May be like Terry Gilliam who is famous for Twelve Monkeys, Brazil etc  The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world based on a butcher (Clapet) who owns an apartment, a new helper(Louison), a circus performer and its tenants, each one of them is hilariously weird. In a world where there is a scarcity of food and it is used as currency, cannibalism has become a way of survival. Clapet fishes people with an advertisement for a helper job and Louison arrives there. Clapet and his tenants planning to feast Louison is the plot. The love between Clapet's daughter and Louison is tender and sweet. Darius Khondji, cinematographer of the movie has done a fabulous job. And editing of the movie is also noteworthy. The title part of the movie is so creative and intriguing. Delicatessen is not a normal film but a dark comedy, weirdly filmed and is very funny at times. Worthwhile!!!

    As far as style goes, this is almost without parallel. Jeunet's own 'Amelie' has moments of very similar style shots and humour and Gilliam's 'Brazil' has some of the zanyness and other world quality of it but other than that, it's more or less on it's own as an example of off-beat hard to pigeonhole non mainstream film. It's a comedy, a dark(ish) post apocalyptic drama, an art house movie, a love story. It touches on horror at times and seems to tick so many boxes, yet doesn't sit in any one of them. Few films manage that so well. The lighting is inventive and the sets are incredible. Even the subtle change of colour tone at the end, perhaps suggesting that everything will be alright now, cleverly plays on the subconscious and beautifully lightens the whole mood of the film at it's close. The wonderfully comic timed spring mattress duet that Louison and Mme Plusse share and Aurore's tragically pathetic attempts to kill herself which only succeed when she doesn't want to do it anymore are shining moments in the comedy of Delicatessen. The militant vegetarians who attempt the rescue and the old self sufficient man living in a flooded apartment with frogs and snails growing wild, providing him with a ready source of food are just part of the absurdity and yet wonder of a film that delights and amazes in equal measures. Truly a great film and to paraphrase a review of The Wire (TV's greatest ever series), I would seriously suggest that "you either love it or you haven't seen it yet"

    Delicatessen looks like a series of sepia tone paintings brought to life in this off beat comedy from Jean Pierre Jeunet. This is one of the strangest, quirkiest films I've ever seen. Jeunet's previous works, Amelie(2009) and Micmacs(2009) were also different but they at least had coherent story lines, Delicatessen does not. It is without structure of any kind. The landlord and butcher of an apartment building and deli in some kind of post apocalyptic France with a food shortage is also a butcher who serves customers meat from a mysterious source. He hires a former circus performer to be a handy man. What follows is good acting wasted by surrealism which tired me out by the end, A very disappointing effort by Mr. Jeunet.

    This is a French movie by the director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and somebody else. Jeunet recently did Alien Resurrection, but that movie is nothing like this one. Delicatessen appears to be a rather low-budget movie. It has no great special effects or dazzling cinematography, but it is brilliant none-the-less. Delicatessen is about an apartment block in a post-apocalyptic Earth. At the bottom of this apartment block is a delicatessen where the butcher sells human meat, and he gets this meat from the people that live in the building. Then a nice man named Louisan comes to the apartment for a job and falls in love with the butcher's daughter Julie. The problem is that Louisan is the next person on the list to be cut up and sold. This movie comes under the classification of foreign movie. There is nothing deep and insightful in it, other than the barbarity of man. That is, in a time where there is no food, humanity will resort to cannibalism to survive. What makes this movie unique though is the characters. The French seem to excel in making brilliant characters. Where the Americans will put serious characters in silly situations, the French put silly characters in serious situations. My favourite is when the trogs kidnapped the wrong woman and then have an argument as to whether she is male or not. Then they realise she is not male so run off leaving her tied up. One then comes back, unties her, kisses her and says "that's in case I don't come back," Okay, you might not think its that funny, but the movie is. American movies tend to have the problem of having the first ten minutes hilarious and then the rest of it is ordinary. The French movies start rather ordinary and the comedy tends to last. It usually is because the characters are just so well done, and they remain in character right through. Delicatessen is just great if you want to see a decent comedy. It is French, and it is much better than a lot of American movies I have seen.

    Almost from the start, with the closeups of fat faces in very strange expressions, I sensed that I had seen the style elsewhere. Then I realized that this movie reminded me of Amelie. Sure enough, it is the same director although this was made about a decade earlier. Amelie is one of my favorite movies; not just for the story but also for the unique imagery. This movie shares that unique visual style but in a more grotesque fashion. Faces are shown in closeup that border on nightmarish. Colors and atmosphere meld to form a bleak, murky, misty and dreary filmscape. It is at once charming and horrifying. One of my favorite scenes is when Louison (Dominique Pinon) is blowing bubbles in the hallway. The two mischievous boys (or "young rascals" played by Boban Janevski and Mikael Todde) are immediately entranced and Louison is spared from any future harassment from them. Indeed, at one point they save his life with their mischief on others. Another of my favorite scenes is when Louison and Juliet (Marie-Loure Dougnat) are playing a duet, she on the cello, he on the saw(?!). Together with the music it was a magic moment. In fact, whenever Louison is shown clowning around, the music is soft and whimsical. Another wonderful moment is when Louison and the Butcher's lover (Karin Viard) are unintentionally playing a song from squeaky mattress springs. In another scene, she and Louison are dancing in his apartment. It looks well enough until you notice that Louison has 3 legs giving new meaning to having 2 left feet. These delightful moments are a stark contrast to the rest of the film. I guess I should expound on what the movie is about. Louison is an out of work clown whose partner has been eaten. He tries to get a job as a handyman for a butcher (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) who is also a tenement owner. The butcher sizes him up and is not sure he will do. He thinks Louison is a bit too scrawny. However, Louison's luggage is all over the street so he gets the job just to clear the way. It would have been better had he not because in an earlier scene, you see someone hiding in a trash can and then getting butchered as the screen goes black. That someone was the last handyman. This movie is set in a post apocalyptic future where food is scarce and indeed, grain has become currency. The world has become divided between those that live underground and still use grain as food instead of currency and those that hoard grain and eat... well, anything else they can get their hands on except grain. I don't think I've ever seen a blacker comedy than this but if you enjoyed Amelie, I think you will also like this movie.

    I watched this movie because of its very high rating, expecting a very funny comedy in an odd and magic environment. as practically everybody says, yes, the settings are beautiful and fun to watch. but I didn't start this movie to be looking at a grotesque diashow with music, but for the "comedy". unfortunately, there is not a single funny thing inside this movie. everything is exaggerated, but that is not enough to be a "comedy". it's just a parody of real life. and NOT funny at all. ach, and the story is very weak and boring. cinematography and atmosphere: 10 story: 1 Comedy: 1 actors: 6

    This French cult movie is a somewhat unusual take on the cannibal film. Set exclusively in an apartment block in a post-apocalyptic city. Food is in very short supply and the butcher/landlord rules the roost. It seems that he is chopping up unsuspecting guests and selling their meat on to his impoverished tenants. One day an ex-circus clown moves in and unwittingly becomes the next target of the butcher. This is a Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro film. Like their other features like The Bunker of the Last Gunshots and The City of the Lost Children, this one also is set in a post-apocalyptic world of extremely vague origins. All their films thrust the viewer into such an alternate world but don't tell them quite why things are like the way they are. Visually, Delicatessen follows the same specific aesthetic as the others too, with an earthy brown and green colour scheme and a retro styling. The apartment block and dress of the inhabitants all recall a much earlier age, yet the setting is clearly in the future. Or is it really simply an alternate world? It's up to the viewer to decide. Whatever the case, this is another visually intricate work, with very detailed set design. There is a lot of consideration taken in creating the surreal world. This also extends to the characterisations too, such as the eccentric man played by Howard Vernon who lives in a dank cellar with a host of frogs and snails for company or the suicidal woman who conceives highly elaborate plans for ending her life, all of which fail for various reasons. You can probably guess from this that the humour is of the dark variety but there are many light comic moments too, such as the excellent scene where various tenants inadvertently create a rhythmical musical number simply by going about their day to day business. There really are a lot of different things to enjoy in this highly inventive comedy.

    Before the colorful dreamworld of "Amelie" caught the worlds' attention, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro unleashed their incredible talents for story telling through originally entertaining vignettes in a post-apocalyptic pre-vegetarian France. From the tasty opening sequence and credits you know the Delicatessen style of black humor with charming attention to detail that leaves its' movie cousin"Brazil" as simply idealistic while this as an exacting humorous story of survival. Focused in a dilapidated apartment complex owned by the butcher (who's shop is below), you better pay your rent! As always, Jeunets' cast of characters keeps your attention while the standard of French humor, sin: pride, food and sex, develop.

    "Delicatessen" marks Jean-Pierre Jeunet's and Marc Caro's first film and it hit like a bomb. While despised by some, it even represents the reinvention of French cinema with new means to others, is the pathfinder of a new avant-garde, which would peak with Jeunet's later "Amelie". Well, "Delicatessen" for sure is an exalting, one-of-a-kind trip into a fantastic, twisted retro-future reality, a very unique dark comedy, quirky in all places, uncompromising in every respect. Indeed, the creative duo behind the project made exactly what they wanted to do - Jeunet, the guy who started off as a director of TV commercials and Caro, the designer/artist with the eye for the extraordinary out-of-place stuff. What is central in this kind of movie is that form dominates over content - to such an extreme degree at times that the narrative might suffer, but it is all embedded in a constantly turning kaleidoscope of impressions that sweeps the viewer with it. Everything is different, mysterious, weird in this surreal setting of a post-apocalyptic apartment building where a butcher hunts for human meat, where grain replaces money, underground living troglodytes plan a revolution and a retired clown enjoys playing the saw. "Delicatessen", while very original, still quotes other movies in a lot of places, and is quoted regularly since its release, clearly showing its impact as a true postmodern phenomenon. Unforgettable are moments like when the whole house suddenly begins to follow a rhythm thanks to noises traveling through its pipes, or when a closer look is necessary at one of the beds to determine a problematic spring. Sounds difficult to imagine why these are classic moments? Well, one needs to see the realization to become a believer. Or learn why to reject it. Because Jeunet movies are as he describes it best himself: Fish, not meat, and you need to be a fish person. At any rate, even if you applaud to Jeunet's resourcefulness: Enjoy him in doses!

    I'm not sure what anyone thinks of when they hear the genre surrealist black comedy. I know I had no idea what to expect from that when reading it in Delicatessen's synopsis. But after watching it I would have to agree. Delicatessen is just that. It's surreal, dark, and twistedly funny. It's the very first film from artsy French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and one of two collaborations between him and Marc Caro. Dominique Pinon, a Jeunet regular, stars as Louison, a clown who moves into an apartment building run by a fat lard of a landlord who also happens to be a butcher. Louison begins to fall in love with the landlord's daughter, Julie, and this stirs up a lot of trouble in this run down little apartment which is full of bizarre characters and is also smack dab in the middle of a post apocalyptic hellscape. What more could you want? Delicatessen is an odd film to watch. I honestly don't know what any of it means and I'm still piecing together what I just watched, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a great time watching it. It's incredibly strange, funny in a devilish and stomach churning kind of way, the kind of humor that you're not sure you should be laughing at, or you're a little afraid to laugh at. For some viewers it might just be a little too weird, but for those who know what they're watching it's nothing short of freaking awesome. Delicatessen is a visual treat that is cruel to the senses.

    Before the colorful dreamworld of "Amelie" caught the worlds' attention, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro unleashed their incredible talents for story telling through originally entertaining vignettes in a post-apocalyptic pre-vegetarian France. From the tasty opening sequence and credits you know the Delicatessen style of black humor with charming attention to detail that leaves its' movie cousin"Brazil" as simply idealistic while this as an exacting humorous story of survival. Focused in a dilapidated apartment complex owned by the butcher (who's shop is below), you better pay your rent! As always, Jeunets' cast of characters keeps your attention while the standard of French humor, sin: pride, food and sex, develop.

    "Delicatessen" marks Jean-Pierre Jeunet's and Marc Caro's first film and it hit like a bomb. While despised by some, it even represents the reinvention of French cinema with new means to others, is the pathfinder of a new avant-garde, which would peak with Jeunet's later "Amelie". Well, "Delicatessen" for sure is an exalting, one-of-a-kind trip into a fantastic, twisted retro-future reality, a very unique dark comedy, quirky in all places, uncompromising in every respect. Indeed, the creative duo behind the project made exactly what they wanted to do - Jeunet, the guy who started off as a director of TV commercials and Caro, the designer/artist with the eye for the extraordinary out-of-place stuff. What is central in this kind of movie is that form dominates over content - to such an extreme degree at times that the narrative might suffer, but it is all embedded in a constantly turning kaleidoscope of impressions that sweeps the viewer with it. Everything is different, mysterious, weird in this surreal setting of a post-apocalyptic apartment building where a butcher hunts for human meat, where grain replaces money, underground living troglodytes plan a revolution and a retired clown enjoys playing the saw. "Delicatessen", while very original, still quotes other movies in a lot of places, and is quoted regularly since its release, clearly showing its impact as a true postmodern phenomenon. Unforgettable are moments like when the whole house suddenly begins to follow a rhythm thanks to noises traveling through its pipes, or when a closer look is necessary at one of the beds to determine a problematic spring. Sounds difficult to imagine why these are classic moments? Well, one needs to see the realization to become a believer. Or learn why to reject it. Because Jeunet movies are as he describes it best himself: Fish, not meat, and you need to be a fish person. At any rate, even if you applaud to Jeunet's resourcefulness: Enjoy him in doses!

    I'm not sure what anyone thinks of when they hear the genre surrealist black comedy. I know I had no idea what to expect from that when reading it in Delicatessen's synopsis. But after watching it I would have to agree. Delicatessen is just that. It's surreal, dark, and twistedly funny. It's the very first film from artsy French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and one of two collaborations between him and Marc Caro. Dominique Pinon, a Jeunet regular, stars as Louison, a clown who moves into an apartment building run by a fat lard of a landlord who also happens to be a butcher. Louison begins to fall in love with the landlord's daughter, Julie, and this stirs up a lot of trouble in this run down little apartment which is full of bizarre characters and is also smack dab in the middle of a post apocalyptic hellscape. What more could you want? Delicatessen is an odd film to watch. I honestly don't know what any of it means and I'm still piecing together what I just watched, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a great time watching it. It's incredibly strange, funny in a devilish and stomach churning kind of way, the kind of humor that you're not sure you should be laughing at, or you're a little afraid to laugh at. For some viewers it might just be a little too weird, but for those who know what they're watching it's nothing short of freaking awesome. Delicatessen is a visual treat that is cruel to the senses. It's creepy and confusing to watch, but you can't help but enjoy it. Nothing is normal in this film, hence the surreal aspect to it, and there's only a weak strand of reality running through this topsy turvy flick. But every aspect of the film fits this crazy mixed up world Jeunet and Caro have created. Everything from the odd scenery that all seems out of place, to the collection of strangely twisted characters that inhabit the apartment, it all fits right in with this world that makes absolutely no sense. Delicatessen is as funny as it is creepy and as entertaining as it is fascinating. As far as analyzing the film goes I'm lost, but I can definitely say that I enjoyed every minute of it. There's a lot about this film to still be deciphered, but that will have to come at a later date after many more viewings of this exceptionally strange film.

    Delicatessen is the second movie of Jean-Pierre Jeunet I'm watching after the notable "Amelie" and this movie really explains that the director's imagination is boundless. May be like Terry Gilliam who is famous for Twelve Monkeys, Brazil etc  The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world based on a butcher (Clapet) who owns an apartment, a new helper(Louison), a circus performer and its tenants, each one of them is hilariously weird. In a world where there is a scarcity of food and it is used as currency, cannibalism has become a way of survival. Clapet fishes people with an advertisement for a helper job and Louison arrives there. Clapet and his tenants planning to feast Louison is the plot. The love between Clapet's daughter and Louison is tender and sweet. Darius Khondji, cinematographer of the movie has done a fabulous job. And editing of the movie is also noteworthy. The title part of the movie is so creative and intriguing. Delicatessen is not a normal film but a dark comedy, weirdly filmed and is very funny at times. Worthwhile!!!

    As far as style goes, this is almost without parallel. Jeunet's own 'Amelie' has moments of very similar style shots and humour and Gilliam's 'Brazil' has some of the zanyness and other world quality of it but other than that, it's more or less on it's own as an example of off-beat hard to pigeonhole non mainstream film. It's a comedy, a dark(ish) post apocalyptic drama, an art house movie, a love story. It touches on horror at times and seems to tick so many boxes, yet doesn't sit in any one of them. Few films manage that so well. The lighting is inventive and the sets are incredible. Even the subtle change of colour tone at the end, perhaps suggesting that everything will be alright now, cleverly plays on the subconscious and beautifully lightens the whole mood of the film at it's close. The wonderfully comic timed spring mattress duet that Louison and Mme Plusse share and Aurore's tragically pathetic attempts to kill herself which only succeed when she doesn't want to do it anymore are shining moments in the comedy of Delicatessen. The militant vegetarians who attempt the rescue and the old self sufficient man living in a flooded apartment with frogs and snails growing wild, providing him with a ready source of food are just part of the absurdity and yet wonder of a film that delights and amazes in equal measures. Truly a great film and to paraphrase a review of The Wire (TV's greatest ever series), I would seriously suggest that "you either love it or you haven't seen it yet"

    Delicatessen looks like a series of sepia tone paintings brought to life in this off beat comedy from Jean Pierre Jeunet. This is one of the strangest, quirkiest films I've ever seen. Jeunet's previous works, Amelie(2009) and Micmacs(2009) were also different but they at least had coherent story lines, Delicatessen does not. It is without structure of any kind. The landlord and butcher of an apartment building and deli in some kind of post apocalyptic France with a food shortage is also a butcher who serves customers meat from a mysterious source. He hires a former circus performer to be a handy man. What follows is good acting wasted by surrealism which tired me out by the end, A very disappointing effort by Mr. Jeunet.

    This is a French movie by the director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and somebody else. Jeunet recently did Alien Resurrection, but that movie is nothing like this one. Delicatessen appears to be a rather low-budget movie. It has no great special effects or dazzling cinematography, but it is brilliant none-the-less. Delicatessen is about an apartment block in a post-apocalyptic Earth. At the bottom of this apartment block is a delicatessen where the butcher sells human meat, and he gets this meat from the people that live in the building. Then a nice man named Louisan comes to the apartment for a job and falls in love with the butcher's daughter Julie. The problem is that Louisan is the next person on the list to be cut up and sold. This movie comes under the classification of foreign movie. There is nothing deep and insightful in it, other than the barbarity of man. That is, in a time where there is no food, humanity will resort to cannibalism to survive. What makes this movie unique though is the characters. The French seem to excel in making brilliant characters. Where the Americans will put serious characters in silly situations, the French put silly characters in serious situations. My favourite is when the trogs kidnapped the wrong woman and then have an argument as to whether she is male or not. Then they realise she is not male so run off leaving her tied up. One then comes back, unties her, kisses her and says "that's in case I don't come back," Okay, you might not think its that funny, but the movie is. American movies tend to have the problem of having the first ten minutes hilarious and then the rest of it is ordinary. The French movies start rather ordinary and the comedy tends to last. It usually is because the characters are just so well done, and they remain in character right through. Delicatessen is just great if you want to see a decent comedy. It is French, and it is much better than a lot of American movies I have seen.

    Almost from the start, with the closeups of fat faces in very strange expressions, I sensed that I had seen the style elsewhere. Then I realized that this movie reminded me of Amelie. Sure enough, it is the same director although this was made about a decade earlier. Amelie is one of my favorite movies; not just for the story but also for the unique imagery. This movie shares that unique visual style but in a more grotesque fashion. Faces are shown in closeup that border on nightmarish. Colors and atmosphere meld to form a bleak, murky, misty and dreary filmscape. It is at once charming and horrifying. One of my favorite scenes is when Louison (Dominique Pinon) is blowing bubbles in the hallway. The two mischievous boys (or "young rascals" played by Boban Janevski and Mikael Todde) are immediately entranced and Louison is spared from any future harassment from them. Indeed, at one point they save his life with their mischief on others. Another of my favorite scenes is when Louison and Juliet (Marie-Loure Dougnat) are playing a duet, she on the cello, he on the saw(?!). Together with the music it was a magic moment. In fact, whenever Louison is shown clowning around, the music is soft and whimsical. Another wonderful moment is when Louison and the Butcher's lover (Karin Viard) are unintentionally playing a song from squeaky mattress springs. In another scene, she and Louison are dancing in his apartment. It looks well enough until you notice that Louison has 3 legs giving new meaning to having 2 left feet. These delightful moments are a stark contrast to the rest of the film. I guess I should expound on what the movie is about. Louison is an out of work clown whose partner has been eaten. He tries to get a job as a handyman for a butcher (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) who is also a tenement owner. The butcher sizes him up and is not sure he will do. He thinks Louison is a bit too scrawny. However, Louison's luggage is all over the street so he gets the job just to clear the way. It would have been better had he not because in an earlier scene, you see someone hiding in a trash can and then getting butchered as the screen goes black. That someone was the last handyman. This movie is set in a post apocalyptic future where food is scarce and indeed, grain has become currency. The world has become divided between those that live underground and still use grain as food instead of currency and those that hoard grain and eat... well, anything else they can get their hands on except grain. I don't think I've ever seen a blacker comedy than this but if you enjoyed Amelie, I think you will also like this movie.

    I watched this movie because of its very high rating, expecting a very funny comedy in an odd and magic environment. as practically everybody says, yes, the settings are beautiful and fun to watch. but I didn't start this movie to be looking at a grotesque diashow with music, but for the "comedy". unfortunately, there is not a single funny thing inside this movie. everything is exaggerated, but that is not enough to be a "comedy". it's just a parody of real life. and NOT funny at all. ach, and the story is very weak and boring. cinematography and atmosphere: 10 story: 1 Comedy: 1 actors: 6

    This French cult movie is a somewhat unusual take on the cannibal film. Set exclusively in an apartment block in a post-apocalyptic city. Food is in very short supply and the butcher/landlord rules the roost. It seems that he is chopping up unsuspecting guests and selling their meat on to his impoverished tenants. One day an ex-circus clown moves in and unwittingly becomes the next target of the butcher. This is a Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro film. Like their other features like The Bunker of the Last Gunshots and The City of the Lost Children, this one also is set in a post-apocalyptic world of extremely vague origins. All their films thrust the viewer into such an alternate world but don't tell them quite why things are like the way they are. Visually, Delicatessen follows the same specific aesthetic as the others too, with an earthy brown and green colour scheme and a retro styling. The apartment block and dress of the inhabitants all recall a much earlier age, yet the setting is clearly in the future. Or is it really simply an alternate world? It's up to the viewer to decide. Whatever the case, this is another visually intricate work, with very detailed set design. There is a lot of consideration taken in creating the surreal world. This also extends to the characterisations too, such as the eccentric man played by Howard Vernon who lives in a dank cellar with a host of frogs and snails for company or the suicidal woman who conceives highly elaborate plans for ending her life, all of which fail for various reasons. You can probably guess from this that the humour is of the dark variety but there are many light comic moments too, such as the excellent scene where various tenants inadvertently create a rhythmical musical number simply by going about their day to day business. There really are a lot of different things to enjoy in this highly inventive comedy.

In another scene, she and Louison are dancing in his apartment. It looks well enough until you notice that Louison has 3 legs giving new meaning to having 2 left feet. These delightful moments are a stark contrast to the rest of the film. I guess I should expound on what the movie is about. Louison is an out of work clown whose partner has been eaten. He tries to get a job as a handyman for a butcher (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) who is also a tenement owner. The butcher sizes him up and is not sure he will do. He thinks Louison is a bit too scrawny. However, Louison's luggage is all over the street so he gets the job just to clear the way. It would have been better had he not because in an earlier scene, you see someone hiding in a trash can and then getting butchered as the screen goes black. That someone was the last handyman. This movie is set in a post apocalyptic future where food is scarce and indeed, grain has become currency. The world has become divided between those that live underground and still use grain as food instead of currency and those that hoard grain and eat... well, anything else they can get their hands on except grain. I don't think I've ever seen a blacker comedy than this but if you enjoyed Amelie, I think you will also like this movie.

    I watched this movie because of its very high rating, expecting a very funny comedy in an odd and magic environment. as practically everybody says, yes, the settings are beautiful and fun to watch. but I didn't start this movie to be looking at a grotesque diashow with music, but for the "comedy". unfortunately, there is not a single funny thing inside this movie. everything is exaggerated, but that is not enough to be a "comedy". it's just a parody of real life. and NOT funny at all. ach, and the story is very weak and boring. cinematography and atmosphere: 10 story: 1 Comedy: 1 actors: 6

    This French cult movie is a somewhat unusual take on the cannibal film. Set exclusively in an apartment block in a post-apocalyptic city. Food is in very short supply and the butcher/landlord rules the roost. It seems that he is chopping up unsuspecting guests and selling their meat on to his impoverished tenants. One day an ex-circus clown moves in and unwittingly becomes the next target of the butcher. This is a Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro film. Like their other features like The Bunker of the Last Gunshots and The City of the Lost Children, this one also is set in a post-apocalyptic world of extremely vague origins. All their films thrust the viewer into such an alternate world but don't tell them quite why things are like the way they are. Visually, Delicatessen follows the same specific aesthetic as the others too, with an earthy brown and green colour scheme and a retro styling. The apartment block and dress of the inhabitants all recall a much earlier age, yet the setting is clearly in the future. Or is it really simply an alternate world? It's up to the viewer to decide. Whatever the case, this is another visually intricate work, with very detailed set design. There is a lot of consideration taken in creating the surreal world. This also extends to the characterisations too, such as the eccentric man played by Howard Vernon who lives in a dank cellar with a host of frogs and snails for company or the suicidal woman who conceives highly elaborate plans for ending her life, all of which fail for various reasons. You can probably guess from this that the humour is of the dark variety but there are many light comic moments too, such as the excellent scene where various tenants inadvertently create a rhythmical musical number simply by going about their day to day business. There really are a lot of different things to enjoy in this highly inventive comedy.

    Before the colorful dreamworld of "Amelie" caught the worlds' attention, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro unleashed their incredible talents for story telling through originally entertaining vignettes in a post-apocalyptic pre-vegetarian France. From the tasty opening sequence and credits you know the Delicatessen style of black humor with charming attention to detail that leaves its' movie cousin"Brazil" as simply idealistic while this as an exacting humorous story of survival. Focused in a dilapidated apartment complex owned by the butcher (who's shop is below), you better pay your rent! As always, Jeunets' cast of characters keeps your attention while the standard of French humor, sin: pride, food and sex, develop.

    "Delicatessen" marks Jean-Pierre Jeunet's and Marc Caro's first film and it hit like a bomb. While despised by some, it even represents the reinvention of French cinema with new means to others, is the pathfinder of a new avant-garde, which would peak with Jeunet's later "Amelie". Well, "Delicatessen" for sure is an exalting, one-of-a-kind trip into a fantastic, twisted retro-future reality, a very unique dark comedy, quirky in all places, uncompromising in every respect. Indeed, the creative duo behind the project made exactly what they wanted to do - Jeunet, the guy who started off as a director of TV commercials and Caro, the designer/artist with the eye for the extraordinary out-of-place stuff. What is central in this kind of movie is that form dominates over content - to such an extreme degree at times that the narrative might suffer, but it is all embedded in a constantly turning kaleidoscope of impressions that sweeps the viewer with it. Everything is different, mysterious, weird in this surreal setting of a post-apocalyptic apartment building where a butcher hunts for human meat, where grain replaces money, underground living troglodytes plan a revolution and a retired clown enjoys playing the saw. "Delicatessen", while very original, still quotes other movies in a lot of places, and is quoted regularly since its release, clearly showing its impact as a true postmodern phenomenon. Unforgettable are moments like when the whole house suddenly begins to follow a rhythm thanks to noises traveling through its pipes, or when a closer look is necessary at one of the beds to determine a problematic spring. Sounds difficult to imagine why these are classic moments? Well, one needs to see the realization to become a believer. Or learn why to reject it. Because Jeunet movies are as he describes it best himself: Fish, not meat, and you need to be a fish person. At any rate, even if you applaud to Jeunet's resourcefulness: Enjoy him in doses!

    I'm not sure what anyone thinks of when they hear the genre surrealist black comedy. I know I had no idea what to expect from that when reading it in Delicatessen's synopsis. But after watching it I would have to agree. Delicatessen is just that. It's surreal, dark, and twistedly funny. It's the very first film from artsy French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and one of two collaborations between him and Marc Caro. Dominique Pinon, a Jeunet regular, stars as Louison, a clown who moves into an apartment building run by a fat lard of a landlord who also happens to be a butcher. Louison begins to fall in love with the landlord's daughter, Julie, and this stirs up a lot of trouble in this run down little apartment which is full of bizarre characters and is also smack dab in the middle of a post apocalyptic hellscape. What more could you want? Delicatessen is an odd film to watch. I honestly don't know what any of it means and I'm still piecing together what I just watched, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a great time watching it. It's incredibly strange, funny in a devilish and stomach churning kind of way, the kind of humor that you're not sure you should be laughing at, or you're a little afraid to laugh at. For some viewers it might just be a little too weird, but for those who know what they're watching it's nothing short of freaking awesome. Delicatessen is a visual treat that is cruel to the senses. It's creepy and confusing to watch, but you can't help but enjoy it. Nothing is normal in this film, hence the surreal aspect to it, and there's only a weak strand of reality running through this topsy turvy flick. But every aspect of the film fits this crazy mixed up world Jeunet and Caro have created. Everything from the odd scenery that all seems out of place, to the collection of strangely twisted characters that inhabit the apartment, it all fits right in with this world that makes absolutely no sense. Delicatessen is as funny as it is creepy and as entertaining as it is fascinating. As far as analyzing the film goes I'm lost, but I can definitely say that I enjoyed every minute of it. There's a lot about this film to still be deciphered, but that will have to come at a later date after many more viewings of this exceptionally strange film.

    Delicatessen is the second movie of Jean-Pierre Jeunet I'm watching after the notable "Amelie" and this movie really explains that the director's imagination is boundless. May be like Terry Gilliam who is famous for Twelve Monkeys, Brazil etc  The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world based on a butcher (Clapet) who owns an apartment, a new helper(Louison), a circus performer and its tenants, each one of them is hilariously weird. In a world where there is a scarcity of food and it is used as currency, cannibalism has become a way of survival. Clapet fishes people with an advertisement for a helper job and Louison arrives there. Clapet and his tenants planning to feast Louison is the plot. The love between Clapet's daughter and Louison is tender and sweet. Darius Khondji, cinematographer of the movie has done a fabulous job. And editing of the movie is also noteworthy. The title part of the movie is so creative and intriguing. Delicatessen is not a normal film but a dark comedy, weirdly filmed and is very funny at times. Worthwhile!!!

    As far as style goes, this is almost without parallel. Jeunet's own 'Amelie' has moments of very similar style shots and humour and Gilliam's 'Brazil' has some of the zanyness and other world quality of it but other than that, it's more or less on it's own as an example of off-beat hard to pigeonhole non mainstream film. It's a comedy, a dark(ish) post apocalyptic drama, an art house movie, a love story. It touches on horror at times and seems to tick so many boxes, yet doesn't sit in any one of them. Few films manage that so well. The lighting is inventive and the sets are incredible. Even the subtle change of colour tone at the end, perhaps suggesting that everything will be alright now, cleverly plays on the subconscious and beautifully lightens the whole mood of the film at it's close. The wonderfully comic timed spring mattress duet that Louison and Mme Plusse share and Aurore's tragically pathetic attempts to kill herself which only succeed when she doesn't want to do it anymore are shining moments in the comedy of Delicatessen. The militant vegetarians who attempt the rescue and the old self sufficient man living in a flooded apartment with frogs and snails growing wild, providing him with a ready source of food are just part of the absurdity and yet wonder of a film that delights and amazes in equal measures. Truly a great film and to paraphrase a review of The Wire (TV's greatest ever series), I would seriously suggest that "you either love it or you haven't seen it yet"

    Delicatessen looks like a series of sepia tone paintings brought to life in this off beat comedy from Jean Pierre Jeunet. This is one of the strangest, quirkiest films I've ever seen. Jeunet's previous works, Amelie(2009) and Micmacs(2009) were also different but they at least had coherent story lines, Delicatessen does not. It is without structure of any kind. The landlord and butcher of an apartment building and deli in some kind of post apocalyptic France with a food shortage is also a butcher who serves customers meat from a mysterious source. He hires a former circus performer to be a handy man. What follows is good acting wasted by surrealism which tired me out by the end, A very disappointing effort by Mr. Jeunet.

    This is a French movie by the director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and somebody else. Jeunet recently did Alien Resurrection, but that movie is nothing like this one. Delicatessen appears to be a rather low-budget movie. It has no great special effects or dazzling cinematography, but it is brilliant none-the-less. Delicatessen is about an apartment block in a post-apocalyptic Earth. At the bottom of this apartment block is a delicatessen where the butcher sells human meat, and he gets this meat from the people that live in the building. Then a nice man named Louisan comes to the apartment for a job and falls in love with the butcher's daughter Julie. The problem is that Louisan is the next person on the list to be cut up and sold. This movie comes under the classification of foreign movie. There is nothing deep and insightful in it, other than the barbarity of man. That is, in a time where there is no food, humanity will resort to cannibalism to survive. What makes this movie unique though is the characters. The French seem to excel in making brilliant characters. Where the Americans will put serious characters in silly situations, the French put silly characters in serious situations. My favourite is when the trogs kidnapped the wrong woman and then have an argument as to whether she is male or not. Then they realise she is not male so run off leaving her tied up. One then comes back, unties her, kisses her and says "that's in case I don't come back," Okay, you might not think its that funny, but the movie is. American movies tend to have the problem of having the first ten minutes hilarious and then the rest of it is ordinary. The French movies start rather ordinary and the comedy tends to last. It usually is because the characters are just so well done, and they remain in character right through. Delicatessen is just great if you want to see a decent comedy. It is French, and it is much better than a lot of American movies I have seen.

    Almost from the start, with the closeups of fat faces in very strange expressions, I sensed that I had seen the style elsewhere. Then I realized that this movie reminded me of Amelie. Sure enough, it is the same director although this was made about a decade earlier. Amelie is one of my favorite movies; not just for the story but also for the unique imagery. This movie shares that unique visual style but in a more grotesque fashion. Faces are shown in closeup that border on nightmarish. Colors and atmosphere meld to form a bleak, murky, misty and dreary filmscape. It is at once charming and horrifying. One of my favorite scenes is when Louison (Dominique Pinon) is blowing bubbles in the hallway. The two mischievous boys (or "young rascals" played by Boban Janevski and Mikael Todde) are immediately entranced and Louison is spared from any future harassment from them. Indeed, at one point they save his life with their mischief on others. Another of my favorite scenes is when Louison and Juliet (Marie-Loure Dougnat) are playing a duet, she on the cello, he on the saw(?!). Together with the music it was a magic moment. In fact, whenever Louison is shown clowning around, the music is soft and whimsical. Another wonderful moment is when Louison and the Butcher's lover (Karin Viard) are unintentionally playing a song from squeaky mattress springs. In another scene, she and Louison are dancing in his apartment. It looks well enough until you notice that Louison has 3 legs giving new meaning to having 2 left feet. These delightful moments are a stark contrast to the rest of the film. I guess I should expound on what the movie is about. Louison is an out of work clown whose partner has been eaten. He tries to get a job as a handyman for a butcher (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) who is also a tenement owner. The butcher sizes him up and is not sure he will do. He thinks Louison is a bit too scrawny. However, Louison's luggage is all over the street so he gets the job just to clear the way. It would have been better had he not because in an earlier scene, you see someone hiding in a trash can and then getting butchered as the screen goes black. That someone was the last handyman. This movie is set in a post apocalyptic future where food is scarce and indeed, grain has become currency. The world has become divided between those that live underground and still use grain as food instead of currency and those that hoard grain and eat... well, anything else they can get their hands on except grain. I don't think I've ever seen a blacker comedy than this but if you enjoyed Amelie, I think you will also like this movie.

    Delicatessen looks like a series of sepia tone paintings brought to life in this off beat comedy from Jean Pierre Jeunet. This is one of the strangest, quirkiest films I've ever seen. Jeunet's previous works, Amelie(2009) and Micmacs(2009) were also different but they at least had coherent story lines, Delicatessen does not. It is without structure of any kind. The landlord and butcher of an apartment building and deli in some kind of post apocalyptic France with a food shortage is also a butcher who serves customers meat from a mysterious source. He hires a former circus performer to be a handy man. What follows is good acting wasted by surrealism which tired me out by the end, A very disappointing effort by Mr. Jeunet.

    This is a French movie by the director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and somebody else. Jeunet recently did Alien Resurrection, but that movie is nothing like this one. Delicatessen appears to be a rather low-budget movie. It has no great special effects or dazzling cinematography, but it is brilliant none-the-less. Delicatessen is about an apartment block in a post-apocalyptic Earth. At the bottom of this apartment block is a delicatessen where the butcher sells human meat, and he gets this meat from the people that live in the building. Then a nice man named Louisan comes to the apartment for a job and falls in love with the butcher's daughter Julie. The problem is that Louisan is the next person on the list to be cut up and sold. This movie comes under the classification of foreign movie. There is nothing deep and insightful in it, other than the barbarity of man. That is, in a time where there is no food, humanity will resort to cannibalism to survive. What makes this movie unique though is the characters. The French seem to excel in making brilliant characters. Where the Americans will put serious characters in silly situations, the French put silly characters in serious situations. My favourite is when the trogs kidnapped the wrong woman and then have an argument as to whether she is male or not. Then they realise she is not male so run off leaving her tied up. One then comes back, unties her, kisses her and says "that's in case I don't come back," Okay, you might not think its that funny, but the movie is. American movies tend to have the problem of having the first ten minutes hilarious and then the rest of it is ordinary. The French movies start rather ordinary and the comedy tends to last. It usually is because the characters are just so well done, and they remain in character right through. Delicatessen is just great if you want to see a decent comedy. It is French, and it is much better than a lot of American movies I have seen.

    Almost from the start, with the closeups of fat faces in very strange expressions, I sensed that I had seen the style elsewhere. Then I realized that this movie reminded me of Amelie. Sure enough, it is the same director although this was made about a decade earlier. Amelie is one of my favorite movies; not just for the story but also for the unique imagery. This movie shares that unique visual style but in a more grotesque fashion. Faces are shown in closeup that border on nightmarish. Colors and atmosphere meld to form a bleak, murky, misty and dreary filmscape. It is at once charming and horrifying. One of my favorite scenes is when Louison (Dominique Pinon) is blowing bubbles in the hallway. The two mischievous boys (or "young rascals" played by Boban Janevski and Mikael Todde) are immediately entranced and Louison is spared from any future harassment from them. Indeed, at one point they save his life with their mischief on others. Another of my favorite scenes is when Louison and Juliet (Marie-Loure Dougnat) are playing a duet, she on the cello, he on the saw(?!). Together with the music it was a magic moment. In fact, whenever Louison is shown clowning around, the music is soft and whimsical. Another wonderful moment is when Louison and the Butcher's lover (Karin Viard) are unintentionally playing a song from squeaky mattress springs. In another scene, she and Louison are dancing in his apartment. It looks well enough until you notice that Louison has 3 legs giving new meaning to having 2 left feet. These delightful moments are a stark contrast to the rest of the film. I guess I should expound on what the movie is about. Louison is an out of work clown whose partner has been eaten. He tries to get a job as a handyman for a butcher (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) who is also a tenement owner. The butcher sizes him up and is not sure he will do. He thinks Louison is a bit too scrawny. However, Louison's luggage is all over the street so he gets the job just to clear the way. It would have been better had he not because in an earlier scene, you see someone hiding in a trash can and then getting butchered as the screen goes black. That someone was the last handyman. This movie is set in a post apocalyptic future where food is scarce and indeed, grain has become currency. The world has become divided between those that live underground and still use grain as food instead of currency and those that hoard grain and eat... well, anything else they can get their hands on except grain. I don't think I've ever seen a blacker comedy than this but if you enjoyed Amelie, I think you will also like this movie.

    I watched this movie because of its very high rating, expecting a very funny comedy in an odd and magic environment. as practically everybody says, yes, the settings are beautiful and fun to watch. but I didn't start this movie to be looking at a grotesque diashow with music, but for the "comedy". unfortunately, there is not a single funny thing inside this movie. everything is exaggerated, but that is not enough to be a "comedy". it's just a parody of real life. and NOT funny at all. ach, and the story is very weak and boring. cinematography and atmosphere: 10 story: 1 Comedy: 1 actors: 6

    This French cult movie is a somewhat unusual take on the cannibal film. Set exclusively in an apartment block in a post-apocalyptic city. Food is in very short supply and the butcher/landlord rules the roost. It seems that he is chopping up unsuspecting guests and selling their meat on to his impoverished tenants. One day an ex-circus clown moves in and unwittingly becomes the next target of the butcher. This is a Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro film. Like their other features like The Bunker of the Last Gunshots and The City of the Lost Children, this one also is set in a post-apocalyptic world of extremely vague origins. All their films thrust the viewer into such an alternate world but don't tell them quite why things are like the way they are. Visually, Delicatessen follows the same specific aesthetic as the others too, with an earthy brown and green colour scheme and a retro styling. The apartment block and dress of the inhabitants all recall a much earlier age, yet the setting is clearly in the future. Or is it really simply an alternate world? It's up to the viewer to decide. Whatever the case, this is another visually intricate work, with very detailed set design. There is a lot of consideration taken in creating the surreal world. This also extends to the characterisations too, such as the eccentric man played by Howard Vernon who lives in a dank cellar with a host of frogs and snails for company or the suicidal woman who conceives highly elaborate plans for ending her life, all of which fail for various reasons. You can probably guess from this that the humour is of the dark variety but there are many light comic moments too, such as the excellent scene where various tenants inadvertently create a rhythmical musical number simply by going about their day to day business. There really are a lot of different things to enjoy in this highly inventive comedy.

    Before the colorful dreamworld of "Amelie" caught the worlds' attention, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro unleashed their incredible talents for story telling through originally entertaining vignettes in a post-apocalyptic pre-vegetarian France. From the tasty opening sequence and credits you know the Delicatessen style of black humor with charming attention to detail that leaves its' movie cousin"Brazil" as simply idealistic while this as an exacting humorous story of survival. Focused in a dilapidated apartment complex owned by the butcher (who's shop is below), you better pay your rent! As always, Jeunets' cast of characters keeps your attention while the standard of French humor, sin: pride, food and sex, develop.

    "Delicatessen" marks Jean-Pierre Jeunet's and Marc Caro's first film and it hit like a bomb. While despised by some, it even represents the reinvention of French cinema with new means to others, is the pathfinder of a new avant-garde, which would peak with Jeunet's later "Amelie". Well, "Delicatessen" for sure is an exalting, one-of-a-kind trip into a fantastic, twisted retro-future reality, a very unique dark comedy, quirky in all places, uncompromising in every respect. Indeed, the creative duo behind the project made exactly what they wanted to do - Jeunet, the guy who started off as a director of TV commercials and Caro, the designer/artist with the eye for the extraordinary out-of-place stuff. What is central in this kind of movie is that form dominates over content - to such an extreme degree at times that the narrative might suffer, but it is all embedded in a constantly turning kaleidoscope of impressions that sweeps the viewer with it. Everything is different, mysterious, weird in this surreal setting of a post-apocalyptic apartment building where a butcher hunts for human meat, where grain replaces money, underground living troglodytes plan a revolution and a retired clown enjoys playing the saw. "Delicatessen", while very original, still quotes other movies in a lot of places, and is quoted regularly since its release, clearly showing its impact as a true postmodern phenomenon. Unforgettable are moments like when the whole house suddenly begins to follow a rhythm thanks to noises traveling through its pipes, or when a closer look is necessary at one of the beds to determine a problematic spring. Sounds difficult to imagine why these are classic moments? Well, one needs to see the realization to become a believer. Or learn why to reject it. Because Jeunet movies are as he describes it best himself: Fish, not meat, and you need to be a fish person. At any rate, even if you applaud to Jeunet's resourcefulness: Enjoy him in doses!

    I'm not sure what anyone thinks of when they hear the genre surrealist black comedy. I know I had no idea what to expect from that when reading it in Delicatessen's synopsis. But after watching it I would have to agree. Delicatessen is just that. It's surreal, dark, and twistedly funny. It's the very first film from artsy French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and one of two collaborations between him and Marc Caro. Dominique Pinon, a Jeunet regular, stars as Louison, a clown who moves into an apartment building run by a fat lard of a landlord who also happens to be a butcher. Louison begins to fall in love with the landlord's daughter, Julie, and this stirs up a lot of trouble in this run down little apartment which is full of bizarre characters and is also smack dab in the middle of a post apocalyptic hellscape. What more could you want? Delicatessen is an odd film to watch. I honestly don't know what any of it means and I'm still piecing together what I just watched, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a great time watching it. It's incredibly strange, funny in a devilish and stomach churning kind of way, the kind of humor that you're not sure you should be laughing at, or you're a little afraid to laugh at. For some viewers it might just be a little too weird, but for those who know what they're watching it's nothing short of freaking awesome. Delicatessen is a visual treat that is cruel to the senses. It's creepy and confusing to watch, but you can't help but enjoy it. Nothing is normal in this film, hence the surreal aspect to it, and there's only a weak strand of reality running through this topsy turvy flick. But every aspect of the film fits this crazy mixed up world Jeunet and Caro have created. Everything from the odd scenery that all seems out of place, to the collection of strangely twisted characters that inhabit the apartment, it all fits right in with this world that makes absolutely no sense. Delicatessen is as funny as it is creepy and as entertaining as it is fascinating. As far as analyzing the film goes I'm lost, but I can definitely say that I enjoyed every minute of it. There's a lot about this film to still be deciphered, but that will have to come at a later date after many more viewings of this exceptionally strange film.

    Delicatessen is the second movie of Jean-Pierre Jeunet I'm watching after the notable "Amelie" and this movie really explains that the director's imagination is boundless. May be like Terry Gilliam who is famous for Twelve Monkeys, Brazil etc  The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world based on a butcher (Clapet) who owns an apartment, a new helper(Louison), a circus performer and its tenants, each one of them is hilariously weird. In a world where there is a scarcity of food and it is used as currency, cannibalism has become a way of survival. Clapet fishes people with an advertisement for a helper job and Louison arrives there. Clapet and his tenants planning to feast Louison is the plot. The love between Clapet's daughter and Louison is tender and sweet. Darius Khondji, cinematographer of the movie has done a fabulous job. And editing of the movie is also noteworthy. The title part of the movie is so creative and intriguing. Delicatessen is not a normal film but a dark comedy, weirdly filmed and is very funny at times. Worthwhile!!!

    As far as style goes, this is almost without parallel. Jeunet's own 'Amelie' has moments of very similar style shots and humour and Gilliam's 'Brazil' has some of the zanyness and other world quality of it but other than that, it's more or less on it's own as an example of off-beat hard to pigeonhole non mainstream film. It's a comedy, a dark(ish) post apocalyptic drama, an art house movie, a love story. It touches on horror at times and seems to tick so many boxes, yet doesn't sit in any one of them. Few films manage that so well. The lighting is inventive and the sets are incredible. Even the subtle change of colour tone at the end, perhaps suggesting that everything will be alright now, cleverly plays on the subconscious and beautifully lightens the whole mood of the film at it's close. The wonderfully comic timed spring mattress duet that Louison and Mme Plusse share and Aurore's tragically pathetic attempts to kill herself which only succeed when she doesn't want to do it anymore are shining moments in the comedy of Delicatessen. The militant vegetarians who attempt the rescue and the old self sufficient man living in a flooded apartment with frogs and snails growing wild, providing him with a ready source of food are just part of the absurdity and yet wonder of a film that delights and amazes in equal measures. Truly a great film and to paraphrase a review of The Wire (TV's greatest ever series), I would seriously suggest that "you either love it or you haven't seen it yet"
