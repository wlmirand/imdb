 <sinopse>
  After having a child out of wedlock, a young Puritan woman is pressured to reveal the name of her lover.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In Puritan Boston, seamstress Hester Prynne is punished for playing on the Sabbath day; but kindly minister Arthur Dimmesdale takes pity on her. The two fall in love, but their relationship cannot be: Hester is already married to Roger Prynne, a physician who has been missing seven years. Dimmesdale has to go away to England; when he returns, he finds Hester pregnant with their child, and the focus of the town's censure. In a humiliating public ceremony, she is forced to don the scarlet letter A - for adultery - and wear it the rest of her life. Dimmesdale is encouraged by the church fathers to demand of Hester the person with whom she sinned.

    Don't go by the smarmy, eye-rolling illustration on the old movie poster displayed on this site. I have no idea who painted that image, but it has nothing whatever in common with Lillian Gish's wonderful performance in this marvelous movie. Although "The Scarlet Letter" hasn't been filmed very often, I don't believe it has ever been filmed any better than it was in this 1926 silent version. Apart from being mounted as a fully-rigged MGM production with all the trimmings, it is beautifully directed, acted and photographed. Above all, in "The Scarlet Letter", Lillian Gish demonstrated once again what a truly fine actress she really was, miles better than such contemporaries as Mary Pickford and Gloria Swanson. Lillian Gish's was real acting, not broad pantomime, as was so often the case in silent movies, and is the reason why some of the genre seem so dated today. "The Scarlet Letter is one silent film that doesn't seem dated and there is little doubt that is due in no small measure to Lillian Gish's performance. Lars Hanson as Reverend Dimmsdale and Henry B. Walthal as Roger Chillingworth are very good. However, the former's perpetual had- wringing anguish, and the latter's equally perpetual scowling, seem cartoonish compared with Gish's far more subtle characterization. Unfortunately, this movie isn't shown very often anymore. Nevertheless, anyone interested in the Scarlet Letter ought to see this version. It will not only increase their appreciation of Hawthorne's story, but that of silent movies as well.

    For anyone who thinks silent movies are dated and dull, have a look at this film from 1926 with Lillian Gish and Lars Hanson. The Scarlet Letter is a drama that still resonates with modern audiences because it depicts the good and the innocent being persecuted by the tyranny of mob justice. In this case, the majority in a New England town violates the dignity and freedom of individuals to enforce a strict moral code. The world of the Puritans in the early American Colonies was rigid and often unforgiving and for those whose lives strayed, stern retribution was the result. Silent stars had to be great actors to convey emotion without words...the eyes, the expression and body language along with brilliant sets and crowd scenes. This film has these qualities as well as crisp captions to tell the story. I found both Lillian Gish and Lars Hanson convincing in their roles as the ill-starred lovers in a time when people seemed to put great stock on enforcing codes of conduct at the expense of transgressors. The expressions on faces in the crowd scenes showed the hearts of stone that would humiliate anyone who crossed the lines. Movies like this one gave 1920's audiences a lesson to reflect upon in a world that was still quite harsh in its own customs and morals. I am no expert on silent films but the few I have seen convey great feelings and emotion. They are a separate category from modern cinema and involve audiences more directly. This view was reinforced for me by the recent movie The Artist. The Scarlet Letter is a brilliant example of the silent movie era.

    I can't help, but give this film a deserved 10. Not only does it go against the idea that silent films were a novelty and a really egregious piece of pantomime, but that it could be completely poignant, pungent, painful and heart aching. What I just mentioned in that list of sentiments really do impose upon this film. The idea that this could be a rudiment is easily debunked by the quantity of reviews that are all nearly consecutively impeccable. Some of the praise for this film can be laid upon Sjostrom's masterful direction replete with the novel of Hawthorne's lyrical words and story. Of course, the films screen time and period is set in the 1800's and it illustrates the hypocrisies of the church, the relentless protest against heresy and that unbelievably taking place all because of a pointless hullabaloo of Hester Prynne not turning up to church. She becomes enamoured with the priest; then she gets pegged as an adulteress. There are subtle moments when her denotation and symbol that is firmly on her are then drew by her Daughter, the most innocuous thing in her life that she couldn't just punish for not understanding. And when she holds her Baby in a plea for serenity - there's no copious intertitles - there's only a break in pure, unadulterated drama. The minister/priest's performance can be hyperbolised at times, but this was probably to posit an alternative state of ambivalence, so it's only a nitpick. Sjostrom's touch to the heart of his audience, infused with Gishes poised and tragedian performance shows that not only was the methodology of this film ahead of the curb, but the fact it's not been released on a legitimate copy is heinous. Another thing that nearly moved me was when one of the onlookers say, when they see Hester's lover go for her, that "He must be the most compassionate Christian ever to go past such evil" (paraphrased). It's true that we get a complete anthropology of this town and it keeps your interest right into the 1hr 37mins running time. When Gish was getting this film past the censors, it was on the list of "Banned Book Adaptations". Her complete regard for the novel allowed for one to push the envelope. She personally hired Sjostrom to direct the film, a novice to Hollywood at the time. He had came of his success on that amazingly suspenseful "Phantom Carriage" (1920). The elements in the film that may not seem very much into his style would be the narrative; it doesn't seem like something he'd tackle, but his craning of the world to show us it especially when an intertitle that inserts says "The day when they didn't take gaiety as an offence" is proof that I got deceived. It seemed as though they were just having merriment in the village, then after coming from a pure long shot, we see from close shot that it was somebody being accused of being a whistle blower. When the character Robert came in the film I was entranced by both the sorrow of the situation and I couldn't turn it off, so much so, that it affected my sleep the next day. It had an insurmountable grip; I believe Sjostrom was one of the few legends of his time that can actually branch to a whole new set of novices. Without a doubt, he learned the craft of storytelling and he learned the tricks and artifices of enticing his audience. Verily, he's not dissimilar to any suspense masters that subsequently came. In "Wild Strawberries" you can see how Sjostrom played his character so well. He understood the trade of acting.

    The Scarlet Letter is a literary masterpiece, and for me this 1926 silent film is the one to see both as an adaptation and on its own. It doesn't follow the book entirely by the letter, but the crux and the spirit of the book are there, and all the characters Hester Prynne in particular are incorporated and written with care. The story is still scintillating, there are some breathtakingly beautiful images on screen helped by the gorgeous cinematography and sumptuous production values. The score is stunning as well, the film is superbly directed and while the whole cast give solid to very, very good performances, Lillian Gish is superb, my favourite performance of hers after La Boheme I'd say. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    When this film began, it sure seemed like the script was written by whoever was responsible for the 1937 version of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", as Hester Prynne was very little like she was in the story. This Hester runs and skips and talks to the animals on the Sabbath and is punished for this(?). In the process, she is taken under the wing of the local minister--changing the story significantly from the Hawthorne of the tale. In the original story, it begins with a pregnant Hester being labeled an adulteress and ostracized by the community--how she fell in love and the sort of woman she was before this was never really part of the original story--here, there is a lot of back story--so much that who the father is of the illegitimate child never is in question. It's obvious that the minister is the sperm donor and the film is much more about WHY the affair began. Aside from this unusual reworking of the story, this MGM production is first-rate. The costumes are excellent, the direction very good and the acting (aside from just a couple times where Gish over-acted--in a style that would have been fine in her early films--when such reactions were the norm) was very good. In fact, it's probably the best version I have seen--far better than the 1930s version or the god-awful Demi Moore version (where they gave this bleak story a happy ending!!!). So, even with an odd reworking and an incomplete ending (the film stopped at the death of the minister--whereas the book continued beyond this), it's about as good as you may find. Now there COULD be a better version out there and I'd love to hear any suggestions about a more definitive version (if it's available). By the way, although the print looks great, at about the one hour mark it really deteriorated. Instead of the clear and near-perfect print, it was very washed out for about five minutes--like they forgot to restore this portion. Bear with it--it does improve...a bit.

    Lillian Gish had always wanted to film Nathaniel Hawthorne's book but she had a lot of opposition. Louis B. Mayer told her that it was on the black list as church and women's groups had banned it. However, when she wrote to the groups, they all agreed to lift the ban if she would personally be responsible for the film - Lillian Gish was a powerful symbol for purity in the twenties. The bleak theme and landscape of the story were second nature to Scandanavian film makers and Lillian was quick to hire Victor Seastrom to direct and a new Swedish actor, Lars Hanson, to star as the kindly minister. Even Henrik Sartov's camera-work had a magnificent but cold beauty, totally in keeping with the harsh New England scenery. "Puritan Boston on a Sabbath day in June" - Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale (Lars Hanson) is beloved throughout the county for his kindness and humility. Hester Prynne (Lillian Gish) is frowned upon - church goers see her running and skipping (she is trying to catch her canary) and that is forbidden on the Sabbath!!! For that she is put in the stocks but is rescued by the smitten minister who never realised that the committee would meter out such harsh punishment. It seems they are the only passionate couple in the county as they conduct their affair in secret, amid such rules as "engaged couples' lips must only meet after marriage" and "women's under- garments must be washed and dryed in secret". Dimmesdale wants to marry Hester - but she is already married, forced by her father to marry a wealthy surgeon (Henry B. Walthall) who she hasn't seen for years. When Dimmesdale returns (he had taken a petition to England) it is to find that Hester is to be punished again - she has had a child out of wedlock. Once again Arthur wants to share her punishment but she is firm that she will not let him sacrifice the good opinion of his parishioners. She is forced to wear an embroidered A on her gown for her whole life - A for Adultress!!! Years pass and even though Hester and Pearl are shunned outcasts, Arthur is never far away. When Pearl is ill Hester rushes to the meeting hall to find a doctor. Hester's husband is there but although he recognises her, he is greatly changed and now goes by the name Dr. Chillingworth. He goes to her cottage and even though he says "such a child should die" cures Pearl. He is a vengeful man and wants to make Hester pay for her sins. He also finds out that Dimmesdale is Pearl's father but wishes to wait - "my vengeance will be infinite"!!! Hester and Arthur decide to go away - Arthur is losing his strength, but before they go he exposes himself as Pearl's father, before the town. He has branded an A onto his chest. The film ends with his death as Hester hopes for the beginning of kindness and understanding for her and Pearl. Lillian Gish's performance is so pure and true - there is no doubt, for people viewing this movie, that she could be the greatest actress of all time. In her early thirties at the time, she has a childlike happiness at the beginning of the film, which changes to bleakness in the harrowing scene when townsfolk are trying to take her baby. Lillian Gish had "discovered" Henrik Sartov when she was making "The Greatest Thing in Life". He used a gauze over the lens, so I have read, to make her look even more youthful. Henry B. Walthall was unrecognisable in the small but telling role of Dr. Chillingworth. Karl Dane had a nice part as Master Giles, an observer throughout the film, who cannot abide the town's cant and hypocrisy. Highly, Highly Recommended.

    Scarlet Letter, The (1926) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Classic production of Hawthorne's story by MGM has Lillian Gish in the role of Hester Prynne, the woman who has an affair with a priest (Lars Hanson) and must wear the sign of an adulterous while keeping the secret of who her lover was. This story has been filmed countless times over the years but this silent version hasn't lost an ounce of its power in terms of the great acting, the greatness of the story and the all around production, which ranks as one of the very best for the studio. There's not a single second in the film where you don't feel as if you're actually living during the time that this thing is set. Everything from the sets to the costumes to the actual atmosphere just puts her right in place with the characters. You can feel their thoughts, their pain and their ignorance in what happens to the Gish character. There are countless great scenes in this film but the highlight has to be where the Gish and Hanson characters start to question love as they sit in a field. To me this entire sequence is one of the most passionate ever filmed as the two actors do a masterful job at showing their love for one another yet they don't even touch. The amount of passion in this scene will set the screen on fire. As much passion as there is, there's also equal amounts of pain. Gish's beautiful, sad eyes so perfectly fits the pain of the character that you can't help but fall in love with her and feel sorry for everything that happens. I can't think of an actress out there who could get so much out of this character as Gish does and this here clearly ranks as one of her greatest performances. Hanson is also extremely good in his scenes, although there are a few times where he goes a bit too over the top. I think he does do a great job at displaying his anguish of the Gish character being punished while he gets away with the same crime. Henry B. Walthall rounds out the cast as the bitter husband. He too turns in marvelous work as he can make you fear him yet at the same time you can't blame him for his anger. All three actors do terrific work together and really take the material and do wonders with it. A lot of the credit must go to director Sjostrom who keeps everything moving at a brisk pace and milks every inch out of the story. His visual style is on full display through the wonderful cinematography and this is brought further to life by the terrific music score played with the film. The first time I watched this movie was via a very dark and badly worn print but the latest, cleaned up print on TCM was a real revelation even though it still showed some damage. Seeing the cleaner print certainly made me appreciate this classic even more than ever.

    I just saw this wonderful film. The restored version aired on TCM in October of 2009, so I wanted to update the comment made by another user that the film had not been aired. Hopefully they will show it again soon. The restored version ran about 97 minutes. The image quality was highly variable, with most scenes very clear and sharp, and others blurred, grainy and dark. I suspect that many of the poorer quality scenes were those cut from the US theatrical release, which I understand was only 80 minutes long (source - Blockbuster 1997 Movie and Video Guide). While I have not read the corresponding novel yet, I am definitely adding it to my reading list. The plot of the novel as summarized on Wikipedia suggests a number of changes in the movie, probably with the aim of making some implied plot elements in the book more explicit for a silent film. Lillian Gish was wonderful in this film. You can really feel her anguish at being punished for only wanting love, and not being able to openly have it due to circumstances beyond her control. At the outset the film does an outstanding job of illustrating the extremely repressive culture of 16th century Boston. This is achieved in various ways, such as attire, excerpts from the colonial laws, and the punishments meted out for things we consider basic freedoms today. One interesting example is the outrage and punishment Hester suffers because she enjoyed hearing her bird singing on (gasp!) a Sunday.

    1926 our sesquicentennial as a country was a banner year in the career of Lillian Gish, bringing to life two classic roles on the silent screen. She was first Mimi in La Boheme and then took on that favorite of high school English classes, The Scarlett Letter. I well remember having to read Hawthorne's novel as a junior and I can say that if this silent version had been available on DVD back in the day it might have helped as a teaching tool. Nathaniel Hawthorne who added the "w" in his last name to disassociate himself with his Puritan ancestors who numbered among them Judge John Hathorne of the Salem Witch Trials was writing as much about contemporary attitudes in New England of his day as he was about the beginnings of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and its Puritan settlers. They were a hardy bunch of people, they had to be, coming to a wilderness and making a home in a forbidding land. The land itself as much as the religion of strict behavioral rules made these people what they were. Hester Prynne is a young woman whose husband disappeared years ago in an Indian raid and is presumed dead. She's a gay young lass, a little to spirited for the Puritan crowd, but she captures the attention of the local minister, the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale. They fall in love and with both their biological clocks ticking get busy. Of course such things were not known in Puritan times, but in Hawthorne's times they were beginning to be suspected. Lillian Gish as Hester gets pregnant and for this crime of adultery she has to wear a scarlet A on her dress for all time. She refuses to name the father. Making matters worse is her long lost husband returns played by Henry B. Walthall, Gish's co-star from The Birth Of A Nation. The part of Roger Chillingworth the husband is a tricky one. He's a nasty sort, a hard man of the times, yet in fact he is an aggrieved party. Walthall strikes just the right balance, he may be aggrieved and you know it, but sympathy is far from what you feel. Lars Hanson plays Dimmesdale who is not a minister in the tradition of James Bakker or Jimmy Swaggart a couple of fellows who paid dear for a quick moment of passion. Those two would be out of place in this pious community. The dictates of his religion clash with his love for Gish and in the end prove too much to handle. The Scarlet Letter as played by Gish, Hanson, and Walthall, is a version I think Nathaniel Hawthorne would approve. And I'm betting Judge Hathorne wouldn't.

    Saturday May 27, 4:00pm The Egyptian Film bears no responsibility to literature beyond its acknowledgment as a source. There have however, been more than a few great works utterly destroyed by terrible screen adaptations. MGM's 1926 film, The Scarlet Letter is not among those casualties. This great film is a shining example of all the principle elements, screenplay, direction, performance and production coming together with phenomenal results. Lillian Gish suggested Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel, a monument of American literature, for her next picture after completing La Boheme with John Gilbert earlier in 1926. The book was included on a 'blacklist' under the aegis of several religious organizations. Miss Gish made a personal plea and consent was granted. Louis Mayer recommended the popular Swedish actor Lars Hanson for the role of Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale and a fellow Swede, the great director Victor Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m (Metro anglicized it to Seastrom)) was brought to Hollywood for the production. The task of adapting the novel was entrusted to Hollywood veteran Francis Marion, whose legendary screen writing career ranged from The Champ and Camille to Son of the Sheik and Zander the Great. The resulting film was not only a masterpiece, it is also one of the greatest literary adaptations in all of film, supporting one of the most profoundly emotional performances of the silent era. Seastrom brought the sensibilities of Swedish cinema, repression, guilt and Puritanism, combined with the integration of beauty in the natural world, to Hawthorne's tale of colonial persecution more successfully than any American director possibly could have. Gish also demonstrates a far greater range than the waif of Griffith's films in her sensitive and overwrought portrayal of Hester Prynne, nearly equaled two years later again with Seastrom and Hanson in The Wind. None of the powerful religious symbolism from the novel seems to be lost in this film. The most significant alterations include an extended prologue showing what led to Hester's condemnation, and the absence of any relationship between Dimmesdale and Roger Chillingworth prior to the sudden, seismic revelation of who they actually are. Seastrom made full use of Hendrik Sartov (a Griffith veteran) and his beautiful camera work to create a mystical, dreamlike vision of Hawthorne's Puritan village. The opening scene of worshipers walking to church in a sweeping shot that slowly pulls back in its arc to reveal the heart of the village, and several additional tracking shots that seem to float above the characters as they travel the country lanes are extraordinary. Seastrom was able to convey huge amounts of the story with nothing more than the movement and reactions of the cast. When Dimmesdale returns, he learns of Hester's punishment. His reactions and her implicit needs are powerfully conveyed almost entirely without the use of titles. The brooding specter of Chillingworth in the forest scene, one of the most beautiful in the film, and his constant, smothering presence is as palpable as any demonic symbol ever devised in German cinema. Seastrom presents image after image (An ominous group of men with lanterns, Hester running in the woods with her long hair flowing behind her, the interior of her house lit by the fire with shadows of a spinning wheel cast against the door, the kinetic and beautifully contrasting crowd scenes) throughout the film, achieving a degree of artistry possibly equaled only by Murnau. The final climactic scene with it's shattering revelation, devastating sorrow etched in the faces of the crowd, and withering emotional intensity, is masterfully executed and has no equal.

She becomes enamoured with the priest; then she gets pegged as an adulteress. There are subtle moments when her denotation and symbol that is firmly on her are then drew by her Daughter, the most innocuous thing in her life that she couldn't just punish for not understanding. And when she holds her Baby in a plea for serenity - there's no copious intertitles - there's only a break in pure, unadulterated drama. The minister/priest's performance can be hyperbolised at times, but this was probably to posit an alternative state of ambivalence, so it's only a nitpick. Sjostrom's touch to the heart of his audience, infused with Gishes poised and tragedian performance shows that not only was the methodology of this film ahead of the curb, but the fact it's not been released on a legitimate copy is heinous. Another thing that nearly moved me was when one of the onlookers say, when they see Hester's lover go for her, that "He must be the most compassionate Christian ever to go past such evil" (paraphrased). It's true that we get a complete anthropology of this town and it keeps your interest right into the 1hr 37mins running time. When Gish was getting this film past the censors, it was on the list of "Banned Book Adaptations". Her complete regard for the novel allowed for one to push the envelope. She personally hired Sjostrom to direct the film, a novice to Hollywood at the time. He had came of his success on that amazingly suspenseful "Phantom Carriage" (1920). The elements in the film that may not seem very much into his style would be the narrative; it doesn't seem like something he'd tackle, but his craning of the world to show us it especially when an intertitle that inserts says "The day when they didn't take gaiety as an offence" is proof that I got deceived. It seemed as though they were just having merriment in the village, then after coming from a pure long shot, we see from close shot that it was somebody being accused of being a whistle blower. When the character Robert came in the film I was entranced by both the sorrow of the situation and I couldn't turn it off, so much so, that it affected my sleep the next day. It had an insurmountable grip; I believe Sjostrom was one of the few legends of his time that can actually branch to a whole new set of novices. Without a doubt, he learned the craft of storytelling and he learned the tricks and artifices of enticing his audience. Verily, he's not dissimilar to any suspense masters that subsequently came. In "Wild Strawberries" you can see how Sjostrom played his character so well. He understood the trade of acting.

    The Scarlet Letter is a literary masterpiece, and for me this 1926 silent film is the one to see both as an adaptation and on its own. It doesn't follow the book entirely by the letter, but the crux and the spirit of the book are there, and all the characters Hester Prynne in particular are incorporated and written with care. The story is still scintillating, there are some breathtakingly beautiful images on screen helped by the gorgeous cinematography and sumptuous production values. The score is stunning as well, the film is superbly directed and while the whole cast give solid to very, very good performances, Lillian Gish is superb, my favourite performance of hers after La Boheme I'd say. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    When this film began, it sure seemed like the script was written by whoever was responsible for the 1937 version of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", as Hester Prynne was very little like she was in the story. This Hester runs and skips and talks to the animals on the Sabbath and is punished for this(?). In the process, she is taken under the wing of the local minister--changing the story significantly from the Hawthorne of the tale. In the original story, it begins with a pregnant Hester being labeled an adulteress and ostracized by the community--how she fell in love and the sort of woman she was before this was never really part of the original story--here, there is a lot of back story--so much that who the father is of the illegitimate child never is in question. It's obvious that the minister is the sperm donor and the film is much more about WHY the affair began. Aside from this unusual reworking of the story, this MGM production is first-rate. The costumes are excellent, the direction very good and the acting (aside from just a couple times where Gish over-acted--in a style that would have been fine in her early films--when such reactions were the norm) was very good. In fact, it's probably the best version I have seen--far better than the 1930s version or the god-awful Demi Moore version (where they gave this bleak story a happy ending!!!). So, even with an odd reworking and an incomplete ending (the film stopped at the death of the minister--whereas the book continued beyond this), it's about as good as you may find. Now there COULD be a better version out there and I'd love to hear any suggestions about a more definitive version (if it's available). By the way, although the print looks great, at about the one hour mark it really deteriorated. Instead of the clear and near-perfect print, it was very washed out for about five minutes--like they forgot to restore this portion. Bear with it--it does improve...a bit.

    Lillian Gish had always wanted to film Nathaniel Hawthorne's book but she had a lot of opposition. Louis B. Mayer told her that it was on the black list as church and women's groups had banned it. However, when she wrote to the groups, they all agreed to lift the ban if she would personally be responsible for the film - Lillian Gish was a powerful symbol for purity in the twenties. The bleak theme and landscape of the story were second nature to Scandanavian film makers and Lillian was quick to hire Victor Seastrom to direct and a new Swedish actor, Lars Hanson, to star as the kindly minister. Even Henrik Sartov's camera-work had a magnificent but cold beauty, totally in keeping with the harsh New England scenery. "Puritan Boston on a Sabbath day in June" - Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale (Lars Hanson) is beloved throughout the county for his kindness and humility. Hester Prynne (Lillian Gish) is frowned upon - church goers see her running and skipping (she is trying to catch her canary) and that is forbidden on the Sabbath!!! For that she is put in the stocks but is rescued by the smitten minister who never realised that the committee would meter out such harsh punishment. It seems they are the only passionate couple in the county as they conduct their affair in secret, amid such rules as "engaged couples' lips must only meet after marriage" and "women's under- garments must be washed and dryed in secret". Dimmesdale wants to marry Hester - but she is already married, forced by her father to marry a wealthy surgeon (Henry B. Walthall) who she hasn't seen for years. When Dimmesdale returns (he had taken a petition to England) it is to find that Hester is to be punished again - she has had a child out of wedlock. Once again Arthur wants to share her punishment but she is firm that she will not let him sacrifice the good opinion of his parishioners. She is forced to wear an embroidered A on her gown for her whole life - A for Adultress!!! Years pass and even though Hester and Pearl are shunned outcasts, Arthur is never far away. When Pearl is ill Hester rushes to the meeting hall to find a doctor. Hester's husband is there but although he recognises her, he is greatly changed and now goes by the name Dr. Chillingworth. He goes to her cottage and even though he says "such a child should die" cures Pearl. He is a vengeful man and wants to make Hester pay for her sins. He also finds out that Dimmesdale is Pearl's father but wishes to wait - "my vengeance will be infinite"!!! Hester and Arthur decide to go away - Arthur is losing his strength, but before they go he exposes himself as Pearl's father, before the town. He has branded an A onto his chest. The film ends with his death as Hester hopes for the beginning of kindness and understanding for her and Pearl. Lillian Gish's performance is so pure and true - there is no doubt, for people viewing this movie, that she could be the greatest actress of all time. In her early thirties at the time, she has a childlike happiness at the beginning of the film, which changes to bleakness in the harrowing scene when townsfolk are trying to take her baby. Lillian Gish had "discovered" Henrik Sartov when she was making "The Greatest Thing in Life". He used a gauze over the lens, so I have read, to make her look even more youthful. Henry B. Walthall was unrecognisable in the small but telling role of Dr. Chillingworth. Karl Dane had a nice part as Master Giles, an observer throughout the film, who cannot abide the town's cant and hypocrisy. Highly, Highly Recommended.

    Scarlet Letter, The (1926) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Classic production of Hawthorne's story by MGM has Lillian Gish in the role of Hester Prynne, the woman who has an affair with a priest (Lars Hanson) and must wear the sign of an adulterous while keeping the secret of who her lover was. This story has been filmed countless times over the years but this silent version hasn't lost an ounce of its power in terms of the great acting, the greatness of the story and the all around production, which ranks as one of the very best for the studio. There's not a single second in the film where you don't feel as if you're actually living during the time that this thing is set. Everything from the sets to the costumes to the actual atmosphere just puts her right in place with the characters. You can feel their thoughts, their pain and their ignorance in what happens to the Gish character. There are countless great scenes in this film but the highlight has to be where the Gish and Hanson characters start to question love as they sit in a field. To me this entire sequence is one of the most passionate ever filmed as the two actors do a masterful job at showing their love for one another yet they don't even touch. The amount of passion in this scene will set the screen on fire. As much passion as there is, there's also equal amounts of pain. Gish's beautiful, sad eyes so perfectly fits the pain of the character that you can't help but fall in love with her and feel sorry for everything that happens. I can't think of an actress out there who could get so much out of this character as Gish does and this here clearly ranks as one of her greatest performances. Hanson is also extremely good in his scenes, although there are a few times where he goes a bit too over the top. I think he does do a great job at displaying his anguish of the Gish character being punished while he gets away with the same crime. Henry B. Walthall rounds out the cast as the bitter husband. He too turns in marvelous work as he can make you fear him yet at the same time you can't blame him for his anger. All three actors do terrific work together and really take the material and do wonders with it. A lot of the credit must go to director Sjostrom who keeps everything moving at a brisk pace and milks every inch out of the story. His visual style is on full display through the wonderful cinematography and this is brought further to life by the terrific music score played with the film. The first time I watched this movie was via a very dark and badly worn print but the latest, cleaned up print on TCM was a real revelation even though it still showed some damage. Seeing the cleaner print certainly made me appreciate this classic even more than ever.

    I just saw this wonderful film. The restored version aired on TCM in October of 2009, so I wanted to update the comment made by another user that the film had not been aired. Hopefully they will show it again soon. The restored version ran about 97 minutes. The image quality was highly variable, with most scenes very clear and sharp, and others blurred, grainy and dark. I suspect that many of the poorer quality scenes were those cut from the US theatrical release, which I understand was only 80 minutes long (source - Blockbuster 1997 Movie and Video Guide). While I have not read the corresponding novel yet, I am definitely adding it to my reading list. The plot of the novel as summarized on Wikipedia suggests a number of changes in the movie, probably with the aim of making some implied plot elements in the book more explicit for a silent film. Lillian Gish was wonderful in this film. You can really feel her anguish at being punished for only wanting love, and not being able to openly have it due to circumstances beyond her control. At the outset the film does an outstanding job of illustrating the extremely repressive culture of 16th century Boston. This is achieved in various ways, such as attire, excerpts from the colonial laws, and the punishments meted out for things we consider basic freedoms today. One interesting example is the outrage and punishment Hester suffers because she enjoyed hearing her bird singing on (gasp!) a Sunday.

    1926 our sesquicentennial as a country was a banner year in the career of Lillian Gish, bringing to life two classic roles on the silent screen. She was first Mimi in La Boheme and then took on that favorite of high school English classes, The Scarlett Letter. I well remember having to read Hawthorne's novel as a junior and I can say that if this silent version had been available on DVD back in the day it might have helped as a teaching tool. Nathaniel Hawthorne who added the "w" in his last name to disassociate himself with his Puritan ancestors who numbered among them Judge John Hathorne of the Salem Witch Trials was writing as much about contemporary attitudes in New England of his day as he was about the beginnings of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and its Puritan settlers. They were a hardy bunch of people, they had to be, coming to a wilderness and making a home in a forbidding land. The land itself as much as the religion of strict behavioral rules made these people what they were. Hester Prynne is a young woman whose husband disappeared years ago in an Indian raid and is presumed dead. She's a gay young lass, a little to spirited for the Puritan crowd, but she captures the attention of the local minister, the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale. They fall in love and with both their biological clocks ticking get busy. Of course such things were not known in Puritan times, but in Hawthorne's times they were beginning to be suspected. Lillian Gish as Hester gets pregnant and for this crime of adultery she has to wear a scarlet A on her dress for all time. She refuses to name the father. Making matters worse is her long lost husband returns played by Henry B. Walthall, Gish's co-star from The Birth Of A Nation. The part of Roger Chillingworth the husband is a tricky one. He's a nasty sort, a hard man of the times, yet in fact he is an aggrieved party. Walthall strikes just the right balance, he may be aggrieved and you know it, but sympathy is far from what you feel. Lars Hanson plays Dimmesdale who is not a minister in the tradition of James Bakker or Jimmy Swaggart a couple of fellows who paid dear for a quick moment of passion. Those two would be out of place in this pious community. The dictates of his religion clash with his love for Gish and in the end prove too much to handle. The Scarlet Letter as played by Gish, Hanson, and Walthall, is a version I think Nathaniel Hawthorne would approve. And I'm betting Judge Hathorne wouldn't.

    Saturday May 27, 4:00pm The Egyptian Film bears no responsibility to literature beyond its acknowledgment as a source. There have however, been more than a few great works utterly destroyed by terrible screen adaptations. MGM's 1926 film, The Scarlet Letter is not among those casualties. This great film is a shining example of all the principle elements, screenplay, direction, performance and production coming together with phenomenal results. Lillian Gish suggested Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel, a monument of American literature, for her next picture after completing La Boheme with John Gilbert earlier in 1926. The book was included on a 'blacklist' under the aegis of several religious organizations. Miss Gish made a personal plea and consent was granted. Louis Mayer recommended the popular Swedish actor Lars Hanson for the role of Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale and a fellow Swede, the great director Victor Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m (Metro anglicized it to Seastrom)) was brought to Hollywood for the production. The task of adapting the novel was entrusted to Hollywood veteran Francis Marion, whose legendary screen writing career ranged from The Champ and Camille to Son of the Sheik and Zander the Great. The resulting film was not only a masterpiece, it is also one of the greatest literary adaptations in all of film, supporting one of the most profoundly emotional performances of the silent era. Seastrom brought the sensibilities of Swedish cinema, repression, guilt and Puritanism, combined with the integration of beauty in the natural world, to Hawthorne's tale of colonial persecution more successfully than any American director possibly could have. Gish also demonstrates a far greater range than the waif of Griffith's films in her sensitive and overwrought portrayal of Hester Prynne, nearly equaled two years later again with Seastrom and Hanson in The Wind. None of the powerful religious symbolism from the novel seems to be lost in this film. The most significant alterations include an extended prologue showing what led to Hester's condemnation, and the absence of any relationship between Dimmesdale and Roger Chillingworth prior to the sudden, seismic revelation of who they actually are. Seastrom made full use of Hendrik Sartov (a Griffith veteran) and his beautiful camera work to create a mystical, dreamlike vision of Hawthorne's Puritan village. The opening scene of worshipers walking to church in a sweeping shot that slowly pulls back in its arc to reveal the heart of the village, and several additional tracking shots that seem to float above the characters as they travel the country lanes are extraordinary. Seastrom was able to convey huge amounts of the story with nothing more than the movement and reactions of the cast. When Dimmesdale returns, he learns of Hester's punishment. His reactions and her implicit needs are powerfully conveyed almost entirely without the use of titles. The brooding specter of Chillingworth in the forest scene, one of the most beautiful in the film, and his constant, smothering presence is as palpable as any demonic symbol ever devised in German cinema. Seastrom presents image after image (An ominous group of men with lanterns, Hester running in the woods with her long hair flowing behind her, the interior of her house lit by the fire with shadows of a spinning wheel cast against the door, the kinetic and beautifully contrasting crowd scenes) throughout the film, achieving a degree of artistry possibly equaled only by Murnau. The final climactic scene with it's shattering revelation, devastating sorrow etched in the faces of the crowd, and withering emotional intensity, is masterfully executed and has no equal.

    Don't go by the smarmy, eye-rolling illustration on the old movie poster displayed on this site. I have no idea who painted that image, but it has nothing whatever in common with Lillian Gish's wonderful performance in this marvelous movie. Although "The Scarlet Letter" hasn't been filmed very often, I don't believe it has ever been filmed any better than it was in this 1926 silent version. Apart from being mounted as a fully-rigged MGM production with all the trimmings, it is beautifully directed, acted and photographed. Above all, in "The Scarlet Letter", Lillian Gish demonstrated once again what a truly fine actress she really was, miles better than such contemporaries as Mary Pickford and Gloria Swanson. Lillian Gish's was real acting, not broad pantomime, as was so often the case in silent movies, and is the reason why some of the genre seem so dated today. "The Scarlet Letter is one silent film that doesn't seem dated and there is little doubt that is due in no small measure to Lillian Gish's performance. Lars Hanson as Reverend Dimmsdale and Henry B. Walthal as Roger Chillingworth are very good. However, the former's perpetual had- wringing anguish, and the latter's equally perpetual scowling, seem cartoonish compared with Gish's far more subtle characterization. Unfortunately, this movie isn't shown very often anymore. Nevertheless, anyone interested in the Scarlet Letter ought to see this version. It will not only increase their appreciation of Hawthorne's story, but that of silent movies as well.

    For anyone who thinks silent movies are dated and dull, have a look at this film from 1926 with Lillian Gish and Lars Hanson. The Scarlet Letter is a drama that still resonates with modern audiences because it depicts the good and the innocent being persecuted by the tyranny of mob justice. In this case, the majority in a New England town violates the dignity and freedom of individuals to enforce a strict moral code. The world of the Puritans in the early American Colonies was rigid and often unforgiving and for those whose lives strayed, stern retribution was the result. Silent stars had to be great actors to convey emotion without words...the eyes, the expression and body language along with brilliant sets and crowd scenes. This film has these qualities as well as crisp captions to tell the story. I found both Lillian Gish and Lars Hanson convincing in their roles as the ill-starred lovers in a time when people seemed to put great stock on enforcing codes of conduct at the expense of transgressors. The expressions on faces in the crowd scenes showed the hearts of stone that would humiliate anyone who crossed the lines. Movies like this one gave 1920's audiences a lesson to reflect upon in a world that was still quite harsh in its own customs and morals. I am no expert on silent films but the few I have seen convey great feelings and emotion. They are a separate category from modern cinema and involve audiences more directly. This view was reinforced for me by the recent movie The Artist. The Scarlet Letter is a brilliant example of the silent movie era.

    I can't help, but give this film a deserved 10. Not only does it go against the idea that silent films were a novelty and a really egregious piece of pantomime, but that it could be completely poignant, pungent, painful and heart aching. What I just mentioned in that list of sentiments really do impose upon this film. The idea that this could be a rudiment is easily debunked by the quantity of reviews that are all nearly consecutively impeccable. Some of the praise for this film can be laid upon Sjostrom's masterful direction replete with the novel of Hawthorne's lyrical words and story. Of course, the films screen time and period is set in the 1800's and it illustrates the hypocrisies of the church, the relentless protest against heresy and that unbelievably taking place all because of a pointless hullabaloo of Hester Prynne not turning up to church. She becomes enamoured with the priest; then she gets pegged as an adulteress. There are subtle moments when her denotation and symbol that is firmly on her are then drew by her Daughter, the most innocuous thing in her life that she couldn't just punish for not understanding. And when she holds her Baby in a plea for serenity - there's no copious intertitles - there's only a break in pure, unadulterated drama. The minister/priest's performance can be hyperbolised at times, but this was probably to posit an alternative state of ambivalence, so it's only a nitpick. Sjostrom's touch to the heart of his audience, infused with Gishes poised and tragedian performance shows that not only was the methodology of this film ahead of the curb, but the fact it's not been released on a legitimate copy is heinous. Another thing that nearly moved me was when one of the onlookers say, when they see Hester's lover go for her, that "He must be the most compassionate Christian ever to go past such evil" (paraphrased). It's true that we get a complete anthropology of this town and it keeps your interest right into the 1hr 37mins running time. When Gish was getting this film past the censors, it was on the list of "Banned Book Adaptations". Her complete regard for the novel allowed for one to push the envelope.

It seemed as though they were just having merriment in the village, then after coming from a pure long shot, we see from close shot that it was somebody being accused of being a whistle blower. When the character Robert came in the film I was entranced by both the sorrow of the situation and I couldn't turn it off, so much so, that it affected my sleep the next day. It had an insurmountable grip; I believe Sjostrom was one of the few legends of his time that can actually branch to a whole new set of novices. Without a doubt, he learned the craft of storytelling and he learned the tricks and artifices of enticing his audience. Verily, he's not dissimilar to any suspense masters that subsequently came. In "Wild Strawberries" you can see how Sjostrom played his character so well. He understood the trade of acting.

"Puritan Boston on a Sabbath day in June" - Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale (Lars Hanson) is beloved throughout the county for his kindness and humility. Hester Prynne (Lillian Gish) is frowned upon - church goers see her running and skipping (she is trying to catch her canary) and that is forbidden on the Sabbath!!! For that she is put in the stocks but is rescued by the smitten minister who never realised that the committee would meter out such harsh punishment. It seems they are the only passionate couple in the county as they conduct their affair in secret, amid such rules as "engaged couples' lips must only meet after marriage" and "women's under- garments must be washed and dryed in secret". Dimmesdale wants to marry Hester - but she is already married, forced by her father to marry a wealthy surgeon (Henry B. Walthall) who she hasn't seen for years. When Dimmesdale returns (he had taken a petition to England) it is to find that Hester is to be punished again - she has had a child out of wedlock. Once again Arthur wants to share her punishment but she is firm that she will not let him sacrifice the good opinion of his parishioners. She is forced to wear an embroidered A on her gown for her whole life - A for Adultress!!! Years pass and even though Hester and Pearl are shunned outcasts, Arthur is never far away. When Pearl is ill Hester rushes to the meeting hall to find a doctor. Hester's husband is there but although he recognises her, he is greatly changed and now goes by the name Dr. Chillingworth. He goes to her cottage and even though he says "such a child should die" cures Pearl. He is a vengeful man and wants to make Hester pay for her sins. He also finds out that Dimmesdale is Pearl's father but wishes to wait - "my vengeance will be infinite"!!! Hester and Arthur decide to go away - Arthur is losing his strength, but before they go he exposes himself as Pearl's father, before the town. He has branded an A onto his chest. The film ends with his death as Hester hopes for the beginning of kindness and understanding for her and Pearl. Lillian Gish's performance is so pure and true - there is no doubt, for people viewing this movie, that she could be the greatest actress of all time. In her early thirties at the time, she has a childlike happiness at the beginning of the film, which changes to bleakness in the harrowing scene when townsfolk are trying to take her baby. Lillian Gish had "discovered" Henrik Sartov when she was making "The Greatest Thing in Life". He used a gauze over the lens, so I have read, to make her look even more youthful. Henry B. Walthall was unrecognisable in the small but telling role of Dr. Chillingworth. Karl Dane had a nice part as Master Giles, an observer throughout the film, who cannot abide the town's cant and hypocrisy. Highly, Highly Recommended.

    Scarlet Letter, The (1926) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Classic production of Hawthorne's story by MGM has Lillian Gish in the role of Hester Prynne, the woman who has an affair with a priest (Lars Hanson) and must wear the sign of an adulterous while keeping the secret of who her lover was. This story has been filmed countless times over the years but this silent version hasn't lost an ounce of its power in terms of the great acting, the greatness of the story and the all around production, which ranks as one of the very best for the studio. There's not a single second in the film where you don't feel as if you're actually living during the time that this thing is set. Everything from the sets to the costumes to the actual atmosphere just puts her right in place with the characters. You can feel their thoughts, their pain and their ignorance in what happens to the Gish character. There are countless great scenes in this film but the highlight has to be where the Gish and Hanson characters start to question love as they sit in a field. To me this entire sequence is one of the most passionate ever filmed as the two actors do a masterful job at showing their love for one another yet they don't even touch. The amount of passion in this scene will set the screen on fire. As much passion as there is, there's also equal amounts of pain. Gish's beautiful, sad eyes so perfectly fits the pain of the character that you can't help but fall in love with her and feel sorry for everything that happens. I can't think of an actress out there who could get so much out of this character as Gish does and this here clearly ranks as one of her greatest performances. Hanson is also extremely good in his scenes, although there are a few times where he goes a bit too over the top. I think he does do a great job at displaying his anguish of the Gish character being punished while he gets away with the same crime. Henry B. Walthall rounds out the cast as the bitter husband. He too turns in marvelous work as he can make you fear him yet at the same time you can't blame him for his anger. All three actors do terrific work together and really take the material and do wonders with it. A lot of the credit must go to director Sjostrom who keeps everything moving at a brisk pace and milks every inch out of the story. His visual style is on full display through the wonderful cinematography and this is brought further to life by the terrific music score played with the film. The first time I watched this movie was via a very dark and badly worn print but the latest, cleaned up print on TCM was a real revelation even though it still showed some damage. Seeing the cleaner print certainly made me appreciate this classic even more than ever.

    I just saw this wonderful film. The restored version aired on TCM in October of 2009, so I wanted to update the comment made by another user that the film had not been aired. Hopefully they will show it again soon. The restored version ran about 97 minutes. The image quality was highly variable, with most scenes very clear and sharp, and others blurred, grainy and dark. I suspect that many of the poorer quality scenes were those cut from the US theatrical release, which I understand was only 80 minutes long (source - Blockbuster 1997 Movie and Video Guide). While I have not read the corresponding novel yet, I am definitely adding it to my reading list. The plot of the novel as summarized on Wikipedia suggests a number of changes in the movie, probably with the aim of making some implied plot elements in the book more explicit for a silent film. Lillian Gish was wonderful in this film. You can really feel her anguish at being punished for only wanting love, and not being able to openly have it due to circumstances beyond her control. At the outset the film does an outstanding job of illustrating the extremely repressive culture of 16th century Boston. This is achieved in various ways, such as attire, excerpts from the colonial laws, and the punishments meted out for things we consider basic freedoms today. One interesting example is the outrage and punishment Hester suffers because she enjoyed hearing her bird singing on (gasp!) a Sunday.

    1926 our sesquicentennial as a country was a banner year in the career of Lillian Gish, bringing to life two classic roles on the silent screen. She was first Mimi in La Boheme and then took on that favorite of high school English classes, The Scarlett Letter. I well remember having to read Hawthorne's novel as a junior and I can say that if this silent version had been available on DVD back in the day it might have helped as a teaching tool. Nathaniel Hawthorne who added the "w" in his last name to disassociate himself with his Puritan ancestors who numbered among them Judge John Hathorne of the Salem Witch Trials was writing as much about contemporary attitudes in New England of his day as he was about the beginnings of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and its Puritan settlers. They were a hardy bunch of people, they had to be, coming to a wilderness and making a home in a forbidding land. The land itself as much as the religion of strict behavioral rules made these people what they were. Hester Prynne is a young woman whose husband disappeared years ago in an Indian raid and is presumed dead. She's a gay young lass, a little to spirited for the Puritan crowd, but she captures the attention of the local minister, the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale. They fall in love and with both their biological clocks ticking get busy. Of course such things were not known in Puritan times, but in Hawthorne's times they were beginning to be suspected. Lillian Gish as Hester gets pregnant and for this crime of adultery she has to wear a scarlet A on her dress for all time. She refuses to name the father. Making matters worse is her long lost husband returns played by Henry B. Walthall, Gish's co-star from The Birth Of A Nation. The part of Roger Chillingworth the husband is a tricky one. He's a nasty sort, a hard man of the times, yet in fact he is an aggrieved party. Walthall strikes just the right balance, he may be aggrieved and you know it, but sympathy is far from what you feel. Lars Hanson plays Dimmesdale who is not a minister in the tradition of James Bakker or Jimmy Swaggart a couple of fellows who paid dear for a quick moment of passion. Those two would be out of place in this pious community. The dictates of his religion clash with his love for Gish and in the end prove too much to handle. The Scarlet Letter as played by Gish, Hanson, and Walthall, is a version I think Nathaniel Hawthorne would approve. And I'm betting Judge Hathorne wouldn't.

    Saturday May 27, 4:00pm The Egyptian Film bears no responsibility to literature beyond its acknowledgment as a source. There have however, been more than a few great works utterly destroyed by terrible screen adaptations. MGM's 1926 film, The Scarlet Letter is not among those casualties. This great film is a shining example of all the principle elements, screenplay, direction, performance and production coming together with phenomenal results. Lillian Gish suggested Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel, a monument of American literature, for her next picture after completing La Boheme with John Gilbert earlier in 1926. The book was included on a 'blacklist' under the aegis of several religious organizations. Miss Gish made a personal plea and consent was granted. Louis Mayer recommended the popular Swedish actor Lars Hanson for the role of Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale and a fellow Swede, the great director Victor Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m (Metro anglicized it to Seastrom)) was brought to Hollywood for the production. The task of adapting the novel was entrusted to Hollywood veteran Francis Marion, whose legendary screen writing career ranged from The Champ and Camille to Son of the Sheik and Zander the Great. The resulting film was not only a masterpiece, it is also one of the greatest literary adaptations in all of film, supporting one of the most profoundly emotional performances of the silent era. Seastrom brought the sensibilities of Swedish cinema, repression, guilt and Puritanism, combined with the integration of beauty in the natural world, to Hawthorne's tale of colonial persecution more successfully than any American director possibly could have. Gish also demonstrates a far greater range than the waif of Griffith's films in her sensitive and overwrought portrayal of Hester Prynne, nearly equaled two years later again with Seastrom and Hanson in The Wind. None of the powerful religious symbolism from the novel seems to be lost in this film. The most significant alterations include an extended prologue showing what led to Hester's condemnation, and the absence of any relationship between Dimmesdale and Roger Chillingworth prior to the sudden, seismic revelation of who they actually are. Seastrom made full use of Hendrik Sartov (a Griffith veteran) and his beautiful camera work to create a mystical, dreamlike vision of Hawthorne's Puritan village. The opening scene of worshipers walking to church in a sweeping shot that slowly pulls back in its arc to reveal the heart of the village, and several additional tracking shots that seem to float above the characters as they travel the country lanes are extraordinary. Seastrom was able to convey huge amounts of the story with nothing more than the movement and reactions of the cast. When Dimmesdale returns, he learns of Hester's punishment. His reactions and her implicit needs are powerfully conveyed almost entirely without the use of titles. The brooding specter of Chillingworth in the forest scene, one of the most beautiful in the film, and his constant, smothering presence is as palpable as any demonic symbol ever devised in German cinema. Seastrom presents image after image (An ominous group of men with lanterns, Hester running in the woods with her long hair flowing behind her, the interior of her house lit by the fire with shadows of a spinning wheel cast against the door, the kinetic and beautifully contrasting crowd scenes) throughout the film, achieving a degree of artistry possibly equaled only by Murnau. The final climactic scene with it's shattering revelation, devastating sorrow etched in the faces of the crowd, and withering emotional intensity, is masterfully executed and has no equal.
