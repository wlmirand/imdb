    After two seminal action films, director John McTiernan shifts towards political suspense thriller territory with very impressive results. The strength of this thriller is the a lot of the story and drama plays out through close ups and characters in confined spaces, and John McTiernan exploits this fully. The plot, adapted from the Tom Clancy novel, is sophisticated and involving, and congratulations go to screenwriters Larry Ferguson, Donald Stewart and John Milius(who did some un-credited work) for crafting a clever, suspenseful, well informed screenplay, peppered with moments of dry humour. Acting performances are fairly broad, and it is no surprise that despite a Scottish accent, Sean Connery's sheer charisma leads to yet another commanding performance that anchors the film. He is ably supported by the cast that plays his submarine crew, albeit for me Sam Neill seemed an unusual choice and didn't quite work. While in small role, Peter Firth is ideal in the political officer role, and Tim Curry is rather amusing as the slightly na&iuml;ve and sycophantic doctor. Alec Baldwin is surprisingly refreshing as the slightly out his depth analyst thrown into the front line, but his character rises to the challenge and becomes the reluctant hero in the end. He receives outstanding support from James Earl Jones, Scott Glenn, Courtney Vance, Anthony Peck, Richard Jordan and Joss Ackland. In fact all these performances are grounded and charismatic, albeit Richard Jordan's and Joss Ackland's diplomatic exchanges are the main vehicle for the film's humour, which plays out very cleverly in what is actually plot exposition for the audience. The production is also expertly crafted by director John McTiernan. He makes full use of Jan de Bont's first rate photography (they had collaborated on Die Hard), and together with production designer Terence Marsh and co-operation from the US Navy, leads to some great in camera set pieces. This is fully realised by Basil Poledouris's excellent score, which creates a truly terrific atmosphere, and the Oscar winning sound effects, that also help bring the audience into the film's settings. Sound editor Cecelia Hall was already a very experienced sound effects editor, having worked on a variety of films including Star Treks 2 and 3, Airplane II, Staying Alive, Beverly Hills Cops 1 & 2,Terms of Endearment, Top Gun, The Golden Child and Action Jackson. After her success on Red October, she would on other high profile films such as Days of Thunder, The Adams Family Movies and Patriot Games. She went on to be Senior Vice-President of Post Production Sound at Paramount, and works as a Professor at UCLA. George Walters II is one of Hollywood's most successful sound editors. After starting work in Hollywood in the seventies, his CV prior to Red October included work on the first three Star Trek movies, Staying Alive, Flash-dance, Beverly Hills Cop 1 & 2, Critical Condition, Crocodile Dundee 2, Naked Gun. After Red October, he continues to rack up first rate work on yet more films including Naked Gun 2.5, Patriot Games, Star Trek VI, The War, Crimson Tide, Broken Arrow, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon, Thomas Crown Affair, Pirates of the Caribbean 1 & 2, Enemy of the State including winning a second Oscar for best sound on Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour. Unfortunately the one failing in the film, despite all the excellent other technical contributions is the visual effects. While not terrible they are clearly not at the level of the rest of the film. Disagreements between director McTiernan and original visual supervisor Richard Edlund, heading up the BOSS fx house, led to the company being removed from the project late in post-production, and George Lucas's ILM having to come in to do a rush job to get something in place for the films March 1990 release. They had to make do with the models that had been built when BOSS was running the visual effects; using a smoked studio with the miniatures hanging from wires, and some subtle digital effects to help sell the illusion of being underwater. They managed to do a reasonable if unremarkable job (albeit the films budget did mushroom). For example the visual fx do not come close to the outstanding work that was done on James Cameron's The Abyss, whose underwater visual fx was so much better, even though that film came out nearly a year earlier(and had its own production problems). Tony Scott's Crimson Tide, that came five years later showed what underwater submarine visual fx should look like. However the film-makers do mitigate the poor quality through editing the shots in quick cuts which means they don't have the opportunity to pull you out of the story. Another clever albeit cynical approach is to blur the footage. This helps sell "underwater", but sometimes makes it difficult to see what is going on, and is a way of potentially hiding imperfections in the actual shot. Nevertheless, despite this the fact the rest of the film was so good allows the audience to still get a great deal of enjoyment out of an expertly crafted political thriller.

    I'll admit it. I don't like war movies. But "Hunt for Red October" is not a war movie, its a story about an era in human history: a story about comradery, friends, enemies, sober pausing at the edge of human destruction, the bomb :-) I watched this movie again and was struck by its power (again!). Its all-male casting makes it a true depiction of a men's world, except here the men are not lone wolves like Rambo, but rather family men trying to avoid the third world war, playing a clever game of cat and mouse with the enemy who is not always the stereotypical savage. When I first saw this as a 15 yo, I couldn't get over the awesome music: I watched the beginning credits on Sony Beta tape over and over again... I still listen to the soundtrack occasionally. If you haven't seen this, you must. You will fall in love with the intricate characters like the sonar operators, sub drivers, etc. The character performances and especially the dialog between soviet officers is absolutely brilliant. This movie is definitely way up there on my top 10 all time movies list.

    Easily the best film ever about a Russian sub captain with a Scottish accent. Actually he's of Lithuanian ancestry, but still... The first movie adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel, an adaptation of his very first one, this is also the first to feature his regular protagonist, Jack Ryan, played here by Alec Baldwin, who plays him quite well as the out-of-his-depth intelligence analyst. It is Sean Connery who dominates the film however as Red October's captain, Marko Ramius. Despite the accent, he is on excellent form throughout. The supporting cast are no slackers either - Sam Neill as Borodin, James Earl Jones as Ryan's mentor Admiral Greer, Scott Glenn as Bart Mancuso, Courtney B Vance as Jones. Underwater scenes often provide pacing problems, and while the models used never actually saw any water, there are a few moments when the pace threatens to sag. Fortunately, it never does, with some hair-raising moments such as the Dallas stalking Red October without the latter even aware they're there, and the climactic battle with the Alfa-class V K Konovolov. There are many other great scenes too such as Ryan's set-to with a saboteur, and the Red October's evasion of a torpedo launched from a 'Bear-Foxtrot'. Basil Poledouris' score is fantastic, lending the film an epic feel, while also ominous in more tense scenes. The film is not without flaws. Some of the effects weren't convincing even in 1990. There are moments when the Red October looks every bit a model, an external shot of a 'Bear-Foxtrot' never looks anything less than one. It would appear a bit of corner-cutting went on with the budget. Witness an F-14 about to crash suddenly turn into vintage footage of an old 50s Grumman F9F. The same shot of a torpedo being dropped from into sea is used twice, once for the Bear, and another for an SH-60 Seahawk. While far more believable than most spy thrillers, a few changes take away from the realism that the book's author is often praised for. The manner in which Jack concludes what Ramius is up to for instance seems awfully contrived - the evidence he bases his conclusion on in the book was actually more simple and perfectly reasonable. Caveats aside, this remains a high point in Cold War cinema, coming out just as that era was effectively over.

    The Hunt For Red October is a quality thriller from one the better action directors of late 80's and early 90's John McTiernan. It features an excellent ensemble cast, convoluted Cold War plot and Sean Connery at his very Connery best. While at times it feels dated and has some annoying clich&eacute;s here and there, it's very entertaining as hell. The strongest element aside from the excellent direction, is the cast. We have Sean Connery, Sam Neill, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Tim Curry, James Earl Jones, Stellan Skarsgard and Jeffrey Jones to name a few. The acting is top notch all around with the highlights being Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin. The only thing that bothered me a lot was the terrible line deliveries in Russian. For a person who has an excellent ear for languages, it felt so out of place and borderline hilarious. But when they start all speaking English it's fine but the first 10 or so minutes are very awkward to watch. From the technical side of things, The Hunt for Red October is great. Lots of practical effects and real locations used for great effect. If they spared the terrible early 90's CGI, it would have felt more timeless and less dated. Just like Das Boot, John McTiernan knows how to create tension and suspense without showing much. It's not as good as Das Boot but still does a fine job. The skillful direction elevates the painfully mediocre and convoluted script considerably. Plot and characters are were The Hunt for Red October falls short. The plot is beyond convoluted and there are many moments you keep scratching your head in confusion. Also some of the characters like the rock star sonar technician were too silly and just felt out place. All the problems are very minor and these small details doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. The Hunt for Red October is a quality early 90's thriller that will satisfy any fans of the Cold War themed films. By all means not the best Cold War thriller or the best submarine film, but easily of the better and more entertaining ones. If you like the cast and the idea of Sean Connery failing in Russian, this is a must see.

    After the pent up, singular set shenanigans of Die Hard comes the grandeur, submarines and warships set, more narratively driven espionage thriller of The Hunt for Red October; John McTiernan's follow up to an action film masterpiece which, itself, is a bit of an action film masterpiece anyway. The film is a nourishing piece; carrying with it a genuine sense of there being craft at hand, a two hour plus piece which rattles along because it's depicting characters and doing well with its premise. Here is the English language thriller that depicts secret agents; nuclear submarines and a general sense of chase, but is happens to be gripping and smart. Where did the process of forcing us to sit stuck in a film's icy grip of ill thought filmmaking, as poorly put together set pieces are spoon fed to us, suddenly vanish to? Aside from the obvious Soviet connotations, the film's immediate opening calls to mind Sergei Eisenstein's montage editing experiment of the 1920s, when three separate objects were inter-cut with a lone man's reaction: To which item was he reacting? Was it all three? How was he reacting to each item? How do we interpret his reaction? When we observe Sean Connery's Russian naval captain Marko Ramius stand aboard his submarine, shortly before it delves below into the depths of the icy ocean and away, we are allowed entry into his 'looking' out at the snowy tips that make up the tail end of whatever stretches of land this is that still constitutes as the Soviet Union. Through a similar method to Eisenstein, McTiernan allows us this "person/item/reaction" structure in his editing of the opening scene. The film's IMDb pitch reads: "the USSR's best submarine captain in their newest sub violates orders and heads for the USA. Is he trying to defect, or to start a war?" - if you know you're cinema, and with all this in mind, you might be able to work out the truth behind such a premise from this cine-literate process of montage construction, something that's revealed ninety minutes later anyway. That's not to degrade the film for being predictable; on the contrary, the film is a remarkably well constructed drama which toys with this premise and sews in a lot of other material wonderfully well. With this rouge Russian submarine loose, the Americans call in the man they have employed in the C.I.A. so as to aid them in their action against it. This man is Jack Ryan, here played by Alec Baldwin; an agent working with a government organisation and a man whose smooth named invokes the likes of "James Bond"; a man whose existence extends to the knowing of the precise dynamics that makes up turbulence before he flirts with a stewardess who's working on board the plane he's using to fly to The States from his home in London. This is, of course, after he's already been driven to the airport in a fancy looking car amidst all the nondescript taxis inferring pre-eminence. Meanwhile, on board Ramius' vessel, the man speaks of doom-laden bible passages and we observe through the props littering his quarters an apparent fondness for a kind of warfare via the literature and certain paintings on show. The unrest extends to the fact one of his crew does well to infiltrate the man's domain before appearing to be killed with Ramius' own bare hands. How the Soviets themselves react is through distributing a second submarine to go after Ramius, with a scattershot Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd character in charge, and whose intentions are to bring Ramius down. The film will spill out into a suspicion and distrust laden piece wherein the dynamic will read something along the lines of the Soviets, who're on the ground, are too stunned by what the Soviets underwater are doing who themselves are confusing the Americans in their submarine underwater who're themselves frightening the Americans on the ground with their actions. This is cut adrift of the gunfire and shooting of Die Hard, ingredients of which indeed make up most English language American action thrillers. But here is a film which, much later on, has a character reveal a gun. Its presence is actually quite startling, if only for the fact we'd completely forgotten about the very existence of such things, and now that one has been introduced into the fray, we're so much more aware of what damage it might induce than we have most probably of any firearm in any proceedings film of The Hunt for Red October's ilk. Such a statement will sound derogatory toward Die Hard. Rest assured, how that film was made was precisely how one should go about making such a film, but this is McTiernan proving he can operate at either ends of the scale. This is one of those all-star cast American 'event' films that happen to be really good instead of empty; overly long and fragmented by this insistence to provide its audience with episodic stunts that disguise its inability to provide a congealed experience of storytelling and depiction of character. The "action" consists of suited men in rooms arguing with one another; the "drama" the ambiguity surrounding a central character's actions.

    Am I alone in thinking Tom Clancy is overrated ? I did once have the misfortune of reading PATRIOT GAMES , you know the thriller where a bunch of Irish terrorists try to kill Jack Ryan because he foiled their plot to kidnap Charles and Diana , you know the thriller where Clancy bludgeons the reader over the head that these Irish terrorists aren't the ones belonging to the IRA but are an entirely different breed of ultra nasty baddies . Compared to the book the unconvincing film version of PATROIT GAMES is almost a fly on the wall documentary on the Irish troubles so after reading the book I didn't bother wasting any more of my life reading his novels . I do recall seeing a TV interview with the author where he claimed he spent six months researching the material for his novels then spent six months writing them . I guess he must be a very slow reader and typist in that case Many of the people on this page who have a Luke warm reaction to the source novel have unreservedly praised this cinematic adaptation and you can understand this . The story for what its worth is riddled with plot inconsistencies . Stop to consider why the Americans think Red October is planning a pre-emptive strike simply because it's sailing close to the United States since the whole point of these ICBM subs is to be able to target a target from anywhere in the world . Simply sailing close to the United States doesn't indicate anything . Likewise if the propulsion system is so effective how do the Americans have no problem detecting the sub while the Soviets can't ? Oh and if Captain Marko Ramius wanted to defect wouldn't he have found an easier way than steal a submarine ? You see if you stop to examine things everything falls apart very quickly . But there's two things that stop this . One is the fine cast. Sean Connery is one of these actors who has always had a very strong physical presence but continually appeared in material that had him miscast . This isn't the case here and it's impossible to think of anyone who would have been anywhere a good substitute as Ramius and he's ably supported by an excellent international cast . Even Tim Curry is convincing in his small role The second saving grace is the impressive cinematography by Jan de Bont . One irritating aspect of film making in the 21st Century is the number of films that all have the same look regardless of who the director of photography is , British in particular suffer from this and it's become a lost art these days with rare notable exceptions such as Roger Deakins . This film sees a cinematographer on top of his game where lighting and colour scheme is concerned

    This movie is based on a Tom Clancy novel of the same name. It is about a Russian Submarine captain, Rameus, who wishes to defect to the United States because his faith in the system has vanished. The themes in this movie revolve around the arms race, a first strike war policy, and immoral policy decisions. The Russians have created a submarine with a silent drive. As such, it can sneak up on the American shore and launch missiles at them without being detected. It is very much a first strike weapon and Rameus does not like this because policy makers in the Kremlin have created it simply to start a war. This is the whole idea of the policy decisions. Rameus respects his motherland, but has come to the conclusion that such a weapon is designed to start a war, not end it and as such he does not want a part of it. In the end he decides that he has had enough and leaves. It is ironic that even though this sub has a silent engine, one American submarine is able to track it. It knows what its signature sounds like and this seems to defeat the entire purpose of this silent engine. The thing that irked me about this movie is that the Russians are the bad guys and the Americans are the good guys. This was set during the Cold War and as such patriotism was required. The thing is that the politician in this movie is a liar and a cheat - a real slime bag, yet he comes out on top and the Russians are portrayed as being the idiots. The Americans land up with this first strike weapon and the Russians lose out big time. This is not surprising because the author is American and he is writing at a time when the Russians were bad and Americans were good. Yet this was written during the time I was a teenager and as such we loved the Russians because they were the bad guys and our parents (mine especially) would constantly rave about how bad they were. In the end I sympathise with the Russians because I do not see them as the evil empire, but rather the other side in a war in which can only be one winner. History is written by the victors and the victors are always seen as being the good guys, even though they probably are not. This is clear when we see the slimy politician in this movie. He is slime yet he is on the side of the winners - though I would hardly call him a good guy. Anyway, I still quite like this movie, and was disappointed with the sequels as they removed Alec Baldwin and replaced him with Harrison Ford. I hate it when they do that.

    The Hunt for Red October is a thriller based on the novel of the same name by Tom Clancy. It was directed by John McTiernan and stars Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin.This was the first of several films based on Tom Clancy's thrillers that presents eccentric CIA analyst Jack Ryan. The year was 1984. Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius sets the plot in motion when he murders his political adviser, burns his orders, and steers his submarine,Red October towards American waters, hoping to defect. The CIA, aware that the Red October was about to embark on an evasive mission to demonstrate its ability to avoid detection and fire its nuclear missiles upon U.S. installations, believes that Ramius is insane, and that he plans to start World War III. To cover their own behinds, the Russians back up the CIA's suspicion. Only Jack Ryan believes that Ramius' mission is not as apocalyptic as it seems -- and it is Ryan who is assigned to infiltrate the Red October to prove his theory. The first Jack Ryan thriller film is a supremely mounted film and well acted by Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery as Jack Ryan and Marko Ramius respectively.It was vastly enjoyable and entertaining that one will not regret watching it and spending many hours discussing about it after viewing the film.And most of all,it was a great adaptation of Tom Clancy's novel.

    Tom Clancy was almost a sleeper hit, in the novel world, anyways, back in the 1980's, and this first film in the Jack Ryan movie adaptations, is a true wonder. Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Sam Niell, James Earl Jones, and more big stars fill the screen in good, sometimes great performances that just enhance the experience. The film shines in the way that it explores submarines, not just the insides in a way like a documentary, but the mood of the sub, the way you could at almost anytime fire a missile and eliminate a city, the duty a seaman has and the pressure he is under with millions and billions of dollars of taxpayers money, and it is almost a haunting film at times, aided by Basil Poledouris' brilliant score. As for the Jack Ryan character, Alec Baldwin, I must admit, gives a realist performance as an up and excited guy who is an analyst on his first field job, sort of, that is. A great film also in its story, and a pace that is seemingly slow at times, but it works nonetheless.

    "The Hunt For Red October" is a 1990 film directed by John McTiernan and stars Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery. The film is adapted from the 1984 Tom Clancy novel about a Soviet nuclear submarine which drops off U.S. scanners, prompting a young CIA analyst (Baldwin) to scramble to find out what the captain's (Connery) motives really are. To start off, I love Tom Clancy. I'm a fairly big fan of his Splinter Cell, Rainbow SIx, and Ghost Recon franchises. I had also heard of "Red October" and that it was directed by the guy who made "Predator" and "Die Hard", so I was already pretty excited to watch this movie. In short, the film did not, in any way, disappoint. What kind of shocked and worried me about this is that this film was filed under the "Thriller" section on Netflix. . .and it's rated PG. Needless to say, this fact sort of worried me. I was wrong though - just because this movie is PG does not mean it isn't "thrilling" in any sense of the word. "Red October" is in fact an "edge of your seat" thriller by definition. Almost every facet of this film is excellent. The script, I found, was very witty and well written by Larry Ferguson. The acting was spectacular, specifically of course from Connery and Baldwin. The score was very awesome and appropriate for the source material. The special effects were very good, especially for the late 80's. I'd say that "The Hunt For Red October" is a solid thriller that will have a hard time disappointing many of its viewers.

Alec Baldwin is surprisingly refreshing as the slightly out his depth analyst thrown into the front line, but his character rises to the challenge and becomes the reluctant hero in the end. He receives outstanding support from James Earl Jones, Scott Glenn, Courtney Vance, Anthony Peck, Richard Jordan and Joss Ackland. In fact all these performances are grounded and charismatic, albeit Richard Jordan's and Joss Ackland's diplomatic exchanges are the main vehicle for the film's humour, which plays out very cleverly in what is actually plot exposition for the audience. The production is also expertly crafted by director John McTiernan. He makes full use of Jan de Bont's first rate photography (they had collaborated on Die Hard), and together with production designer Terence Marsh and co-operation from the US Navy, leads to some great in camera set pieces. This is fully realised by Basil Poledouris's excellent score, which creates a truly terrific atmosphere, and the Oscar winning sound effects, that also help bring the audience into the film's settings.

She went on to be Senior Vice-President of Post Production Sound at Paramount, and works as a Professor at UCLA. George Walters II is one of Hollywood's most successful sound editors. After starting work in Hollywood in the seventies, his CV prior to Red October included work on the first three Star Trek movies, Staying Alive, Flash-dance, Beverly Hills Cop 1 & 2, Critical Condition, Crocodile Dundee 2, Naked Gun. After Red October, he continues to rack up first rate work on yet more films including Naked Gun 2.5, Patriot Games, Star Trek VI, The War, Crimson Tide, Broken Arrow, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon, Thomas Crown Affair, Pirates of the Caribbean 1 & 2, Enemy of the State including winning a second Oscar for best sound on Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour. Unfortunately the one failing in the film, despite all the excellent other technical contributions is the visual effects. While not terrible they are clearly not at the level of the rest of the film. Disagreements between director McTiernan and original visual supervisor Richard Edlund, heading up the BOSS fx house, led to the company being removed from the project late in post-production, and George Lucas's ILM having to come in to do a rush job to get something in place for the films March 1990 release. They had to make do with the models that had been built when BOSS was running the visual effects; using a smoked studio with the miniatures hanging from wires, and some subtle digital effects to help sell the illusion of being underwater. They managed to do a reasonable if unremarkable job (albeit the films budget did mushroom). For example the visual fx do not come close to the outstanding work that was done on James Cameron's The Abyss, whose underwater visual fx was so much better, even though that film came out nearly a year earlier(and had its own production problems). Tony Scott's Crimson Tide, that came five years later showed what underwater submarine visual fx should look like. However the film-makers do mitigate the poor quality through editing the shots in quick cuts which means they don't have the opportunity to pull you out of the story. Another clever albeit cynical approach is to blur the footage. This helps sell "underwater", but sometimes makes it difficult to see what is going on, and is a way of potentially hiding imperfections in the actual shot. Nevertheless, despite this the fact the rest of the film was so good allows the audience to still get a great deal of enjoyment out of an expertly crafted political thriller.

    I'll admit it. I don't like war movies. But "Hunt for Red October" is not a war movie, its a story about an era in human history: a story about comradery, friends, enemies, sober pausing at the edge of human destruction, the bomb :-) I watched this movie again and was struck by its power (again!). Its all-male casting makes it a true depiction of a men's world, except here the men are not lone wolves like Rambo, but rather family men trying to avoid the third world war, playing a clever game of cat and mouse with the enemy who is not always the stereotypical savage. When I first saw this as a 15 yo, I couldn't get over the awesome music: I watched the beginning credits on Sony Beta tape over and over again... I still listen to the soundtrack occasionally. If you haven't seen this, you must. You will fall in love with the intricate characters like the sonar operators, sub drivers, etc. The character performances and especially the dialog between soviet officers is absolutely brilliant. This movie is definitely way up there on my top 10 all time movies list.

    Easily the best film ever about a Russian sub captain with a Scottish accent. Actually he's of Lithuanian ancestry, but still... The first movie adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel, an adaptation of his very first one, this is also the first to feature his regular protagonist, Jack Ryan, played here by Alec Baldwin, who plays him quite well as the out-of-his-depth intelligence analyst. It is Sean Connery who dominates the film however as Red October's captain, Marko Ramius. Despite the accent, he is on excellent form throughout. The supporting cast are no slackers either - Sam Neill as Borodin, James Earl Jones as Ryan's mentor Admiral Greer, Scott Glenn as Bart Mancuso, Courtney B Vance as Jones. Underwater scenes often provide pacing problems, and while the models used never actually saw any water, there are a few moments when the pace threatens to sag. Fortunately, it never does, with some hair-raising moments such as the Dallas stalking Red October without the latter even aware they're there, and the climactic battle with the Alfa-class V K Konovolov. There are many other great scenes too such as Ryan's set-to with a saboteur, and the Red October's evasion of a torpedo launched from a 'Bear-Foxtrot'. Basil Poledouris' score is fantastic, lending the film an epic feel, while also ominous in more tense scenes. The film is not without flaws. Some of the effects weren't convincing even in 1990. There are moments when the Red October looks every bit a model, an external shot of a 'Bear-Foxtrot' never looks anything less than one. It would appear a bit of corner-cutting went on with the budget. Witness an F-14 about to crash suddenly turn into vintage footage of an old 50s Grumman F9F. The same shot of a torpedo being dropped from into sea is used twice, once for the Bear, and another for an SH-60 Seahawk. While far more believable than most spy thrillers, a few changes take away from the realism that the book's author is often praised for. The manner in which Jack concludes what Ramius is up to for instance seems awfully contrived - the evidence he bases his conclusion on in the book was actually more simple and perfectly reasonable. Caveats aside, this remains a high point in Cold War cinema, coming out just as that era was effectively over.

    The Hunt For Red October is a quality thriller from one the better action directors of late 80's and early 90's John McTiernan. It features an excellent ensemble cast, convoluted Cold War plot and Sean Connery at his very Connery best. While at times it feels dated and has some annoying clich&eacute;s here and there, it's very entertaining as hell. The strongest element aside from the excellent direction, is the cast. We have Sean Connery, Sam Neill, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Tim Curry, James Earl Jones, Stellan Skarsgard and Jeffrey Jones to name a few. The acting is top notch all around with the highlights being Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin. The only thing that bothered me a lot was the terrible line deliveries in Russian. For a person who has an excellent ear for languages, it felt so out of place and borderline hilarious. But when they start all speaking English it's fine but the first 10 or so minutes are very awkward to watch. From the technical side of things, The Hunt for Red October is great. Lots of practical effects and real locations used for great effect. If they spared the terrible early 90's CGI, it would have felt more timeless and less dated. Just like Das Boot, John McTiernan knows how to create tension and suspense without showing much. It's not as good as Das Boot but still does a fine job. The skillful direction elevates the painfully mediocre and convoluted script considerably. Plot and characters are were The Hunt for Red October falls short. The plot is beyond convoluted and there are many moments you keep scratching your head in confusion. Also some of the characters like the rock star sonar technician were too silly and just felt out place. All the problems are very minor and these small details doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. The Hunt for Red October is a quality early 90's thriller that will satisfy any fans of the Cold War themed films. By all means not the best Cold War thriller or the best submarine film, but easily of the better and more entertaining ones. If you like the cast and the idea of Sean Connery failing in Russian, this is a must see.

    After the pent up, singular set shenanigans of Die Hard comes the grandeur, submarines and warships set, more narratively driven espionage thriller of The Hunt for Red October; John McTiernan's follow up to an action film masterpiece which, itself, is a bit of an action film masterpiece anyway. The film is a nourishing piece; carrying with it a genuine sense of there being craft at hand, a two hour plus piece which rattles along because it's depicting characters and doing well with its premise. Here is the English language thriller that depicts secret agents; nuclear submarines and a general sense of chase, but is happens to be gripping and smart. Where did the process of forcing us to sit stuck in a film's icy grip of ill thought filmmaking, as poorly put together set pieces are spoon fed to us, suddenly vanish to? Aside from the obvious Soviet connotations, the film's immediate opening calls to mind Sergei Eisenstein's montage editing experiment of the 1920s, when three separate objects were inter-cut with a lone man's reaction: To which item was he reacting? Was it all three? How was he reacting to each item? How do we interpret his reaction? When we observe Sean Connery's Russian naval captain Marko Ramius stand aboard his submarine, shortly before it delves below into the depths of the icy ocean and away, we are allowed entry into his 'looking' out at the snowy tips that make up the tail end of whatever stretches of land this is that still constitutes as the Soviet Union. Through a similar method to Eisenstein, McTiernan allows us this "person/item/reaction" structure in his editing of the opening scene. The film's IMDb pitch reads: "the USSR's best submarine captain in their newest sub violates orders and heads for the USA. Is he trying to defect, or to start a war?" - if you know you're cinema, and with all this in mind, you might be able to work out the truth behind such a premise from this cine-literate process of montage construction, something that's revealed ninety minutes later anyway. That's not to degrade the film for being predictable; on the contrary, the film is a remarkably well constructed drama which toys with this premise and sews in a lot of other material wonderfully well. With this rouge Russian submarine loose, the Americans call in the man they have employed in the C.I.A. so as to aid them in their action against it. This man is Jack Ryan, here played by Alec Baldwin; an agent working with a government organisation and a man whose smooth named invokes the likes of "James Bond"; a man whose existence extends to the knowing of the precise dynamics that makes up turbulence before he flirts with a stewardess who's working on board the plane he's using to fly to The States from his home in London. This is, of course, after he's already been driven to the airport in a fancy looking car amidst all the nondescript taxis inferring pre-eminence. Meanwhile, on board Ramius' vessel, the man speaks of doom-laden bible passages and we observe through the props littering his quarters an apparent fondness for a kind of warfare via the literature and certain paintings on show. The unrest extends to the fact one of his crew does well to infiltrate the man's domain before appearing to be killed with Ramius' own bare hands. How the Soviets themselves react is through distributing a second submarine to go after Ramius, with a scattershot Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd character in charge, and whose intentions are to bring Ramius down. The film will spill out into a suspicion and distrust laden piece wherein the dynamic will read something along the lines of the Soviets, who're on the ground, are too stunned by what the Soviets underwater are doing who themselves are confusing the Americans in their submarine underwater who're themselves frightening the Americans on the ground with their actions. This is cut adrift of the gunfire and shooting of Die Hard, ingredients of which indeed make up most English language American action thrillers. But here is a film which, much later on, has a character reveal a gun. Its presence is actually quite startling, if only for the fact we'd completely forgotten about the very existence of such things, and now that one has been introduced into the fray, we're so much more aware of what damage it might induce than we have most probably of any firearm in any proceedings film of The Hunt for Red October's ilk. Such a statement will sound derogatory toward Die Hard. Rest assured, how that film was made was precisely how one should go about making such a film, but this is McTiernan proving he can operate at either ends of the scale. This is one of those all-star cast American 'event' films that happen to be really good instead of empty; overly long and fragmented by this insistence to provide its audience with episodic stunts that disguise its inability to provide a congealed experience of storytelling and depiction of character. The "action" consists of suited men in rooms arguing with one another; the "drama" the ambiguity surrounding a central character's actions.

    Am I alone in thinking Tom Clancy is overrated ? I did once have the misfortune of reading PATRIOT GAMES , you know the thriller where a bunch of Irish terrorists try to kill Jack Ryan because he foiled their plot to kidnap Charles and Diana , you know the thriller where Clancy bludgeons the reader over the head that these Irish terrorists aren't the ones belonging to the IRA but are an entirely different breed of ultra nasty baddies . Compared to the book the unconvincing film version of PATROIT GAMES is almost a fly on the wall documentary on the Irish troubles so after reading the book I didn't bother wasting any more of my life reading his novels . I do recall seeing a TV interview with the author where he claimed he spent six months researching the material for his novels then spent six months writing them . I guess he must be a very slow reader and typist in that case Many of the people on this page who have a Luke warm reaction to the source novel have unreservedly praised this cinematic adaptation and you can understand this . The story for what its worth is riddled with plot inconsistencies . Stop to consider why the Americans think Red October is planning a pre-emptive strike simply because it's sailing close to the United States since the whole point of these ICBM subs is to be able to target a target from anywhere in the world . Simply sailing close to the United States doesn't indicate anything . Likewise if the propulsion system is so effective how do the Americans have no problem detecting the sub while the Soviets can't ? Oh and if Captain Marko Ramius wanted to defect wouldn't he have found an easier way than steal a submarine ? You see if you stop to examine things everything falls apart very quickly . But there's two things that stop this . One is the fine cast. Sean Connery is one of these actors who has always had a very strong physical presence but continually appeared in material that had him miscast . This isn't the case here and it's impossible to think of anyone who would have been anywhere a good substitute as Ramius and he's ably supported by an excellent international cast . Even Tim Curry is convincing in his small role The second saving grace is the impressive cinematography by Jan de Bont . One irritating aspect of film making in the 21st Century is the number of films that all have the same look regardless of who the director of photography is , British in particular suffer from this and it's become a lost art these days with rare notable exceptions such as Roger Deakins . This film sees a cinematographer on top of his game where lighting and colour scheme is concerned

    This movie is based on a Tom Clancy novel of the same name. It is about a Russian Submarine captain, Rameus, who wishes to defect to the United States because his faith in the system has vanished. The themes in this movie revolve around the arms race, a first strike war policy, and immoral policy decisions. The Russians have created a submarine with a silent drive. As such, it can sneak up on the American shore and launch missiles at them without being detected. It is very much a first strike weapon and Rameus does not like this because policy makers in the Kremlin have created it simply to start a war. This is the whole idea of the policy decisions. Rameus respects his motherland, but has come to the conclusion that such a weapon is designed to start a war, not end it and as such he does not want a part of it. In the end he decides that he has had enough and leaves. It is ironic that even though this sub has a silent engine, one American submarine is able to track it. It knows what its signature sounds like and this seems to defeat the entire purpose of this silent engine. The thing that irked me about this movie is that the Russians are the bad guys and the Americans are the good guys. This was set during the Cold War and as such patriotism was required. The thing is that the politician in this movie is a liar and a cheat - a real slime bag, yet he comes out on top and the Russians are portrayed as being the idiots. The Americans land up with this first strike weapon and the Russians lose out big time. This is not surprising because the author is American and he is writing at a time when the Russians were bad and Americans were good. Yet this was written during the time I was a teenager and as such we loved the Russians because they were the bad guys and our parents (mine especially) would constantly rave about how bad they were. In the end I sympathise with the Russians because I do not see them as the evil empire, but rather the other side in a war in which can only be one winner. History is written by the victors and the victors are always seen as being the good guys, even though they probably are not. This is clear when we see the slimy politician in this movie. He is slime yet he is on the side of the winners - though I would hardly call him a good guy. Anyway, I still quite like this movie, and was disappointed with the sequels as they removed Alec Baldwin and replaced him with Harrison Ford. I hate it when they do that.

    The Hunt for Red October is a thriller based on the novel of the same name by Tom Clancy. It was directed by John McTiernan and stars Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin.This was the first of several films based on Tom Clancy's thrillers that presents eccentric CIA analyst Jack Ryan. The year was 1984. Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius sets the plot in motion when he murders his political adviser, burns his orders, and steers his submarine,Red October towards American waters, hoping to defect. The CIA, aware that the Red October was about to embark on an evasive mission to demonstrate its ability to avoid detection and fire its nuclear missiles upon U.S. installations, believes that Ramius is insane, and that he plans to start World War III. To cover their own behinds, the Russians back up the CIA's suspicion. Only Jack Ryan believes that Ramius' mission is not as apocalyptic as it seems -- and it is Ryan who is assigned to infiltrate the Red October to prove his theory. The first Jack Ryan thriller film is a supremely mounted film and well acted by Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery as Jack Ryan and Marko Ramius respectively.It was vastly enjoyable and entertaining that one will not regret watching it and spending many hours discussing about it after viewing the film.And most of all,it was a great adaptation of Tom Clancy's novel.

    Tom Clancy was almost a sleeper hit, in the novel world, anyways, back in the 1980's, and this first film in the Jack Ryan movie adaptations, is a true wonder. Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Sam Niell, James Earl Jones, and more big stars fill the screen in good, sometimes great performances that just enhance the experience. The film shines in the way that it explores submarines, not just the insides in a way like a documentary, but the mood of the sub, the way you could at almost anytime fire a missile and eliminate a city, the duty a seaman has and the pressure he is under with millions and billions of dollars of taxpayers money, and it is almost a haunting film at times, aided by Basil Poledouris' brilliant score. As for the Jack Ryan character, Alec Baldwin, I must admit, gives a realist performance as an up and excited guy who is an analyst on his first field job, sort of, that is. A great film also in its story, and a pace that is seemingly slow at times, but it works nonetheless.

    "The Hunt For Red October" is a 1990 film directed by John McTiernan and stars Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery. The film is adapted from the 1984 Tom Clancy novel about a Soviet nuclear submarine which drops off U.S. scanners, prompting a young CIA analyst (Baldwin) to scramble to find out what the captain's (Connery) motives really are. To start off, I love Tom Clancy. I'm a fairly big fan of his Splinter Cell, Rainbow SIx, and Ghost Recon franchises. I had also heard of "Red October" and that it was directed by the guy who made "Predator" and "Die Hard", so I was already pretty excited to watch this movie. In short, the film did not, in any way, disappoint. What kind of shocked and worried me about this is that this film was filed under the "Thriller" section on Netflix. . .and it's rated PG. Needless to say, this fact sort of worried me. I was wrong though - just because this movie is PG does not mean it isn't "thrilling" in any sense of the word. "Red October" is in fact an "edge of your seat" thriller by definition. Almost every facet of this film is excellent. The script, I found, was very witty and well written by Larry Ferguson. The acting was spectacular, specifically of course from Connery and Baldwin. The score was very awesome and appropriate for the source material. The special effects were very good, especially for the late 80's. I'd say that "The Hunt For Red October" is a solid thriller that will have a hard time disappointing many of its viewers.

    After two seminal action films, director John McTiernan shifts towards political suspense thriller territory with very impressive results. The strength of this thriller is the a lot of the story and drama plays out through close ups and characters in confined spaces, and John McTiernan exploits this fully. The plot, adapted from the Tom Clancy novel, is sophisticated and involving, and congratulations go to screenwriters Larry Ferguson, Donald Stewart and John Milius(who did some un-credited work) for crafting a clever, suspenseful, well informed screenplay, peppered with moments of dry humour. Acting performances are fairly broad, and it is no surprise that despite a Scottish accent, Sean Connery's sheer charisma leads to yet another commanding performance that anchors the film. He is ably supported by the cast that plays his submarine crew, albeit for me Sam Neill seemed an unusual choice and didn't quite work. While in small role, Peter Firth is ideal in the political officer role, and Tim Curry is rather amusing as the slightly na&iuml;ve and sycophantic doctor. Alec Baldwin is surprisingly refreshing as the slightly out his depth analyst thrown into the front line, but his character rises to the challenge and becomes the reluctant hero in the end. He receives outstanding support from James Earl Jones, Scott Glenn, Courtney Vance, Anthony Peck, Richard Jordan and Joss Ackland. In fact all these performances are grounded and charismatic, albeit Richard Jordan's and Joss Ackland's diplomatic exchanges are the main vehicle for the film's humour, which plays out very cleverly in what is actually plot exposition for the audience. The production is also expertly crafted by director John McTiernan. He makes full use of Jan de Bont's first rate photography (they had collaborated on Die Hard), and together with production designer Terence Marsh and co-operation from the US Navy, leads to some great in camera set pieces. This is fully realised by Basil Poledouris's excellent score, which creates a truly terrific atmosphere, and the Oscar winning sound effects, that also help bring the audience into the film's settings. Sound editor Cecelia Hall was already a very experienced sound effects editor, having worked on a variety of films including Star Treks 2 and 3, Airplane II, Staying Alive, Beverly Hills Cops 1 & 2,Terms of Endearment, Top Gun, The Golden Child and Action Jackson. After her success on Red October, she would on other high profile films such as Days of Thunder, The Adams Family Movies and Patriot Games. She went on to be Senior Vice-President of Post Production Sound at Paramount, and works as a Professor at UCLA. George Walters II is one of Hollywood's most successful sound editors. After starting work in Hollywood in the seventies, his CV prior to Red October included work on the first three Star Trek movies, Staying Alive, Flash-dance, Beverly Hills Cop 1 & 2, Critical Condition, Crocodile Dundee 2, Naked Gun. After Red October, he continues to rack up first rate work on yet more films including Naked Gun 2.5, Patriot Games, Star Trek VI, The War, Crimson Tide, Broken Arrow, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon, Thomas Crown Affair, Pirates of the Caribbean 1 & 2, Enemy of the State including winning a second Oscar for best sound on Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour. Unfortunately the one failing in the film, despite all the excellent other technical contributions is the visual effects. While not terrible they are clearly not at the level of the rest of the film. Disagreements between director McTiernan and original visual supervisor Richard Edlund, heading up the BOSS fx house, led to the company being removed from the project late in post-production, and George Lucas's ILM having to come in to do a rush job to get something in place for the films March 1990 release. They had to make do with the models that had been built when BOSS was running the visual effects; using a smoked studio with the miniatures hanging from wires, and some subtle digital effects to help sell the illusion of being underwater. They managed to do a reasonable if unremarkable job (albeit the films budget did mushroom). For example the visual fx do not come close to the outstanding work that was done on James Cameron's The Abyss, whose underwater visual fx was so much better, even though that film came out nearly a year earlier(and had its own production problems). Tony Scott's Crimson Tide, that came five years later showed what underwater submarine visual fx should look like. However the film-makers do mitigate the poor quality through editing the shots in quick cuts which means they don't have the opportunity to pull you out of the story. Another clever albeit cynical approach is to blur the footage. This helps sell "underwater", but sometimes makes it difficult to see what is going on, and is a way of potentially hiding imperfections in the actual shot. Nevertheless, despite this the fact the rest of the film was so good allows the audience to still get a great deal of enjoyment out of an expertly crafted political thriller.

The manner in which Jack concludes what Ramius is up to for instance seems awfully contrived - the evidence he bases his conclusion on in the book was actually more simple and perfectly reasonable. Caveats aside, this remains a high point in Cold War cinema, coming out just as that era was effectively over.

    The Hunt For Red October is a quality thriller from one the better action directors of late 80's and early 90's John McTiernan. It features an excellent ensemble cast, convoluted Cold War plot and Sean Connery at his very Connery best. While at times it feels dated and has some annoying clich&eacute;s here and there, it's very entertaining as hell. The strongest element aside from the excellent direction, is the cast. We have Sean Connery, Sam Neill, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Tim Curry, James Earl Jones, Stellan Skarsgard and Jeffrey Jones to name a few. The acting is top notch all around with the highlights being Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin. The only thing that bothered me a lot was the terrible line deliveries in Russian. For a person who has an excellent ear for languages, it felt so out of place and borderline hilarious. But when they start all speaking English it's fine but the first 10 or so minutes are very awkward to watch. From the technical side of things, The Hunt for Red October is great. Lots of practical effects and real locations used for great effect. If they spared the terrible early 90's CGI, it would have felt more timeless and less dated. Just like Das Boot, John McTiernan knows how to create tension and suspense without showing much. It's not as good as Das Boot but still does a fine job. The skillful direction elevates the painfully mediocre and convoluted script considerably. Plot and characters are were The Hunt for Red October falls short. The plot is beyond convoluted and there are many moments you keep scratching your head in confusion. Also some of the characters like the rock star sonar technician were too silly and just felt out place. All the problems are very minor and these small details doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. The Hunt for Red October is a quality early 90's thriller that will satisfy any fans of the Cold War themed films. By all means not the best Cold War thriller or the best submarine film, but easily of the better and more entertaining ones. If you like the cast and the idea of Sean Connery failing in Russian, this is a must see.

    After the pent up, singular set shenanigans of Die Hard comes the grandeur, submarines and warships set, more narratively driven espionage thriller of The Hunt for Red October; John McTiernan's follow up to an action film masterpiece which, itself, is a bit of an action film masterpiece anyway. The film is a nourishing piece; carrying with it a genuine sense of there being craft at hand, a two hour plus piece which rattles along because it's depicting characters and doing well with its premise. Here is the English language thriller that depicts secret agents; nuclear submarines and a general sense of chase, but is happens to be gripping and smart. Where did the process of forcing us to sit stuck in a film's icy grip of ill thought filmmaking, as poorly put together set pieces are spoon fed to us, suddenly vanish to? Aside from the obvious Soviet connotations, the film's immediate opening calls to mind Sergei Eisenstein's montage editing experiment of the 1920s, when three separate objects were inter-cut with a lone man's reaction: To which item was he reacting? Was it all three? How was he reacting to each item? How do we interpret his reaction? When we observe Sean Connery's Russian naval captain Marko Ramius stand aboard his submarine, shortly before it delves below into the depths of the icy ocean and away, we are allowed entry into his 'looking' out at the snowy tips that make up the tail end of whatever stretches of land this is that still constitutes as the Soviet Union. Through a similar method to Eisenstein, McTiernan allows us this "person/item/reaction" structure in his editing of the opening scene. The film's IMDb pitch reads: "the USSR's best submarine captain in their newest sub violates orders and heads for the USA. Is he trying to defect, or to start a war?" - if you know you're cinema, and with all this in mind, you might be able to work out the truth behind such a premise from this cine-literate process of montage construction, something that's revealed ninety minutes later anyway. That's not to degrade the film for being predictable; on the contrary, the film is a remarkably well constructed drama which toys with this premise and sews in a lot of other material wonderfully well. With this rouge Russian submarine loose, the Americans call in the man they have employed in the C.I.A. so as to aid them in their action against it. This man is Jack Ryan, here played by Alec Baldwin; an agent working with a government organisation and a man whose smooth named invokes the likes of "James Bond"; a man whose existence extends to the knowing of the precise dynamics that makes up turbulence before he flirts with a stewardess who's working on board the plane he's using to fly to The States from his home in London. This is, of course, after he's already been driven to the airport in a fancy looking car amidst all the nondescript taxis inferring pre-eminence. Meanwhile, on board Ramius' vessel, the man speaks of doom-laden bible passages and we observe through the props littering his quarters an apparent fondness for a kind of warfare via the literature and certain paintings on show. The unrest extends to the fact one of his crew does well to infiltrate the man's domain before appearing to be killed with Ramius' own bare hands. How the Soviets themselves react is through distributing a second submarine to go after Ramius, with a scattershot Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd character in charge, and whose intentions are to bring Ramius down. The film will spill out into a suspicion and distrust laden piece wherein the dynamic will read something along the lines of the Soviets, who're on the ground, are too stunned by what the Soviets underwater are doing who themselves are confusing the Americans in their submarine underwater who're themselves frightening the Americans on the ground with their actions. This is cut adrift of the gunfire and shooting of Die Hard, ingredients of which indeed make up most English language American action thrillers. But here is a film which, much later on, has a character reveal a gun. Its presence is actually quite startling, if only for the fact we'd completely forgotten about the very existence of such things, and now that one has been introduced into the fray, we're so much more aware of what damage it might induce than we have most probably of any firearm in any proceedings film of The Hunt for Red October's ilk. Such a statement will sound derogatory toward Die Hard. Rest assured, how that film was made was precisely how one should go about making such a film, but this is McTiernan proving he can operate at either ends of the scale. This is one of those all-star cast American 'event' films that happen to be really good instead of empty; overly long and fragmented by this insistence to provide its audience with episodic stunts that disguise its inability to provide a congealed experience of storytelling and depiction of character. The "action" consists of suited men in rooms arguing with one another; the "drama" the ambiguity surrounding a central character's actions.

    Am I alone in thinking Tom Clancy is overrated ? I did once have the misfortune of reading PATRIOT GAMES , you know the thriller where a bunch of Irish terrorists try to kill Jack Ryan because he foiled their plot to kidnap Charles and Diana , you know the thriller where Clancy bludgeons the reader over the head that these Irish terrorists aren't the ones belonging to the IRA but are an entirely different breed of ultra nasty baddies . Compared to the book the unconvincing film version of PATROIT GAMES is almost a fly on the wall documentary on the Irish troubles so after reading the book I didn't bother wasting any more of my life reading his novels . I do recall seeing a TV interview with the author where he claimed he spent six months researching the material for his novels then spent six months writing them . I guess he must be a very slow reader and typist in that case Many of the people on this page who have a Luke warm reaction to the source novel have unreservedly praised this cinematic adaptation and you can understand this . The story for what its worth is riddled with plot inconsistencies . Stop to consider why the Americans think Red October is planning a pre-emptive strike simply because it's sailing close to the United States since the whole point of these ICBM subs is to be able to target a target from anywhere in the world . Simply sailing close to the United States doesn't indicate anything . Likewise if the propulsion system is so effective how do the Americans have no problem detecting the sub while the Soviets can't ? Oh and if Captain Marko Ramius wanted to defect wouldn't he have found an easier way than steal a submarine ? You see if you stop to examine things everything falls apart very quickly . But there's two things that stop this . One is the fine cast. Sean Connery is one of these actors who has always had a very strong physical presence but continually appeared in material that had him miscast . This isn't the case here and it's impossible to think of anyone who would have been anywhere a good substitute as Ramius and he's ably supported by an excellent international cast . Even Tim Curry is convincing in his small role The second saving grace is the impressive cinematography by Jan de Bont . One irritating aspect of film making in the 21st Century is the number of films that all have the same look regardless of who the director of photography is , British in particular suffer from this and it's become a lost art these days with rare notable exceptions such as Roger Deakins . This film sees a cinematographer on top of his game where lighting and colour scheme is concerned

    This movie is based on a Tom Clancy novel of the same name. It is about a Russian Submarine captain, Rameus, who wishes to defect to the United States because his faith in the system has vanished. The themes in this movie revolve around the arms race, a first strike war policy, and immoral policy decisions. The Russians have created a submarine with a silent drive. As such, it can sneak up on the American shore and launch missiles at them without being detected. It is very much a first strike weapon and Rameus does not like this because policy makers in the Kremlin have created it simply to start a war. This is the whole idea of the policy decisions. Rameus respects his motherland, but has come to the conclusion that such a weapon is designed to start a war, not end it and as such he does not want a part of it. In the end he decides that he has had enough and leaves. It is ironic that even though this sub has a silent engine, one American submarine is able to track it. It knows what its signature sounds like and this seems to defeat the entire purpose of this silent engine. The thing that irked me about this movie is that the Russians are the bad guys and the Americans are the good guys. This was set during the Cold War and as such patriotism was required. The thing is that the politician in this movie is a liar and a cheat - a real slime bag, yet he comes out on top and the Russians are portrayed as being the idiots. The Americans land up with this first strike weapon and the Russians lose out big time. This is not surprising because the author is American and he is writing at a time when the Russians were bad and Americans were good. Yet this was written during the time I was a teenager and as such we loved the Russians because they were the bad guys and our parents (mine especially) would constantly rave about how bad they were. In the end I sympathise with the Russians because I do not see them as the evil empire, but rather the other side in a war in which can only be one winner. History is written by the victors and the victors are always seen as being the good guys, even though they probably are not. This is clear when we see the slimy politician in this movie. He is slime yet he is on the side of the winners - though I would hardly call him a good guy. Anyway, I still quite like this movie, and was disappointed with the sequels as they removed Alec Baldwin and replaced him with Harrison Ford. I hate it when they do that.

    The Hunt for Red October is a thriller based on the novel of the same name by Tom Clancy. It was directed by John McTiernan and stars Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin.This was the first of several films based on Tom Clancy's thrillers that presents eccentric CIA analyst Jack Ryan. The year was 1984. Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius sets the plot in motion when he murders his political adviser, burns his orders, and steers his submarine,Red October towards American waters, hoping to defect. The CIA, aware that the Red October was about to embark on an evasive mission to demonstrate its ability to avoid detection and fire its nuclear missiles upon U.S. installations, believes that Ramius is insane, and that he plans to start World War III. To cover their own behinds, the Russians back up the CIA's suspicion. Only Jack Ryan believes that Ramius' mission is not as apocalyptic as it seems -- and it is Ryan who is assigned to infiltrate the Red October to prove his theory. The first Jack Ryan thriller film is a supremely mounted film and well acted by Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery as Jack Ryan and Marko Ramius respectively.It was vastly enjoyable and entertaining that one will not regret watching it and spending many hours discussing about it after viewing the film.And most of all,it was a great adaptation of Tom Clancy's novel.

    Tom Clancy was almost a sleeper hit, in the novel world, anyways, back in the 1980's, and this first film in the Jack Ryan movie adaptations, is a true wonder. Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Sam Niell, James Earl Jones, and more big stars fill the screen in good, sometimes great performances that just enhance the experience. The film shines in the way that it explores submarines, not just the insides in a way like a documentary, but the mood of the sub, the way you could at almost anytime fire a missile and eliminate a city, the duty a seaman has and the pressure he is under with millions and billions of dollars of taxpayers money, and it is almost a haunting film at times, aided by Basil Poledouris' brilliant score. As for the Jack Ryan character, Alec Baldwin, I must admit, gives a realist performance as an up and excited guy who is an analyst on his first field job, sort of, that is. A great film also in its story, and a pace that is seemingly slow at times, but it works nonetheless.

    "The Hunt For Red October" is a 1990 film directed by John McTiernan and stars Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery. The film is adapted from the 1984 Tom Clancy novel about a Soviet nuclear submarine which drops off U.S. scanners, prompting a young CIA analyst (Baldwin) to scramble to find out what the captain's (Connery) motives really are. To start off, I love Tom Clancy. I'm a fairly big fan of his Splinter Cell, Rainbow SIx, and Ghost Recon franchises. I had also heard of "Red October" and that it was directed by the guy who made "Predator" and "Die Hard", so I was already pretty excited to watch this movie. In short, the film did not, in any way, disappoint. What kind of shocked and worried me about this is that this film was filed under the "Thriller" section on Netflix. . .and it's rated PG. Needless to say, this fact sort of worried me. I was wrong though - just because this movie is PG does not mean it isn't "thrilling" in any sense of the word. "Red October" is in fact an "edge of your seat" thriller by definition. Almost every facet of this film is excellent. The script, I found, was very witty and well written by Larry Ferguson. The acting was spectacular, specifically of course from Connery and Baldwin. The score was very awesome and appropriate for the source material. The special effects were very good, especially for the late 80's. I'd say that "The Hunt For Red October" is a solid thriller that will have a hard time disappointing many of its viewers.

    After two seminal action films, director John McTiernan shifts towards political suspense thriller territory with very impressive results. The strength of this thriller is the a lot of the story and drama plays out through close ups and characters in confined spaces, and John McTiernan exploits this fully. The plot, adapted from the Tom Clancy novel, is sophisticated and involving, and congratulations go to screenwriters Larry Ferguson, Donald Stewart and John Milius(who did some un-credited work) for crafting a clever, suspenseful, well informed screenplay, peppered with moments of dry humour. Acting performances are fairly broad, and it is no surprise that despite a Scottish accent, Sean Connery's sheer charisma leads to yet another commanding performance that anchors the film. He is ably supported by the cast that plays his submarine crew, albeit for me Sam Neill seemed an unusual choice and didn't quite work. While in small role, Peter Firth is ideal in the political officer role, and Tim Curry is rather amusing as the slightly na&iuml;ve and sycophantic doctor. Alec Baldwin is surprisingly refreshing as the slightly out his depth analyst thrown into the front line, but his character rises to the challenge and becomes the reluctant hero in the end. He receives outstanding support from James Earl Jones, Scott Glenn, Courtney Vance, Anthony Peck, Richard Jordan and Joss Ackland. In fact all these performances are grounded and charismatic, albeit Richard Jordan's and Joss Ackland's diplomatic exchanges are the main vehicle for the film's humour, which plays out very cleverly in what is actually plot exposition for the audience. The production is also expertly crafted by director John McTiernan. He makes full use of Jan de Bont's first rate photography (they had collaborated on Die Hard), and together with production designer Terence Marsh and co-operation from the US Navy, leads to some great in camera set pieces. This is fully realised by Basil Poledouris's excellent score, which creates a truly terrific atmosphere, and the Oscar winning sound effects, that also help bring the audience into the film's settings. Sound editor Cecelia Hall was already a very experienced sound effects editor, having worked on a variety of films including Star Treks 2 and 3, Airplane II, Staying Alive, Beverly Hills Cops 1 & 2,Terms of Endearment, Top Gun, The Golden Child and Action Jackson. After her success on Red October, she would on other high profile films such as Days of Thunder, The Adams Family Movies and Patriot Games. She went on to be Senior Vice-President of Post Production Sound at Paramount, and works as a Professor at UCLA. George Walters II is one of Hollywood's most successful sound editors. After starting work in Hollywood in the seventies, his CV prior to Red October included work on the first three Star Trek movies, Staying Alive, Flash-dance, Beverly Hills Cop 1 & 2, Critical Condition, Crocodile Dundee 2, Naked Gun. After Red October, he continues to rack up first rate work on yet more films including Naked Gun 2.5, Patriot Games, Star Trek VI, The War, Crimson Tide, Broken Arrow, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon, Thomas Crown Affair, Pirates of the Caribbean 1 & 2, Enemy of the State including winning a second Oscar for best sound on Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour. Unfortunately the one failing in the film, despite all the excellent other technical contributions is the visual effects. While not terrible they are clearly not at the level of the rest of the film. Disagreements between director McTiernan and original visual supervisor Richard Edlund, heading up the BOSS fx house, led to the company being removed from the project late in post-production, and George Lucas's ILM having to come in to do a rush job to get something in place for the films March 1990 release. They had to make do with the models that had been built when BOSS was running the visual effects; using a smoked studio with the miniatures hanging from wires, and some subtle digital effects to help sell the illusion of being underwater. They managed to do a reasonable if unremarkable job (albeit the films budget did mushroom). For example the visual fx do not come close to the outstanding work that was done on James Cameron's The Abyss, whose underwater visual fx was so much better, even though that film came out nearly a year earlier(and had its own production problems). Tony Scott's Crimson Tide, that came five years later showed what underwater submarine visual fx should look like. However the film-makers do mitigate the poor quality through editing the shots in quick cuts which means they don't have the opportunity to pull you out of the story. Another clever albeit cynical approach is to blur the footage. This helps sell "underwater", but sometimes makes it difficult to see what is going on, and is a way of potentially hiding imperfections in the actual shot. Nevertheless, despite this the fact the rest of the film was so good allows the audience to still get a great deal of enjoyment out of an expertly crafted political thriller.

    I'll admit it. I don't like war movies. But "Hunt for Red October" is not a war movie, its a story about an era in human history: a story about comradery, friends, enemies, sober pausing at the edge of human destruction, the bomb :-) I watched this movie again and was struck by its power (again!). Its all-male casting makes it a true depiction of a men's world, except here the men are not lone wolves like Rambo, but rather family men trying to avoid the third world war, playing a clever game of cat and mouse with the enemy who is not always the stereotypical savage. When I first saw this as a 15 yo, I couldn't get over the awesome music: I watched the beginning credits on Sony Beta tape over and over again... I still listen to the soundtrack occasionally. If you haven't seen this, you must. You will fall in love with the intricate characters like the sonar operators, sub drivers, etc. The character performances and especially the dialog between soviet officers is absolutely brilliant. This movie is definitely way up there on my top 10 all time movies list.

    Easily the best film ever about a Russian sub captain with a Scottish accent. Actually he's of Lithuanian ancestry, but still... The first movie adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel, an adaptation of his very first one, this is also the first to feature his regular protagonist, Jack Ryan, played here by Alec Baldwin, who plays him quite well as the out-of-his-depth intelligence analyst. It is Sean Connery who dominates the film however as Red October's captain, Marko Ramius. Despite the accent, he is on excellent form throughout. The supporting cast are no slackers either - Sam Neill as Borodin, James Earl Jones as Ryan's mentor Admiral Greer, Scott Glenn as Bart Mancuso, Courtney B Vance as Jones. Underwater scenes often provide pacing problems, and while the models used never actually saw any water, there are a few moments when the pace threatens to sag. Fortunately, it never does, with some hair-raising moments such as the Dallas stalking Red October without the latter even aware they're there, and the climactic battle with the Alfa-class V K Konovolov. There are many other great scenes too such as Ryan's set-to with a saboteur, and the Red October's evasion of a torpedo launched from a 'Bear-Foxtrot'. Basil Poledouris' score is fantastic, lending the film an epic feel, while also ominous in more tense scenes. The film is not without flaws. Some of the effects weren't convincing even in 1990. There are moments when the Red October looks every bit a model, an external shot of a 'Bear-Foxtrot' never looks anything less than one. It would appear a bit of corner-cutting went on with the budget. Witness an F-14 about to crash suddenly turn into vintage footage of an old 50s Grumman F9F. The same shot of a torpedo being dropped from into sea is used twice, once for the Bear, and another for an SH-60 Seahawk. While far more believable than most spy thrillers, a few changes take away from the realism that the book's author is often praised for. The manner in which Jack concludes what Ramius is up to for instance seems awfully contrived - the evidence he bases his conclusion on in the book was actually more simple and perfectly reasonable. Caveats aside, this remains a high point in Cold War cinema, coming out just as that era was effectively over.

    The Hunt For Red October is a quality thriller from one the better action directors of late 80's and early 90's John McTiernan. It features an excellent ensemble cast, convoluted Cold War plot and Sean Connery at his very Connery best. While at times it feels dated and has some annoying clich&eacute;s here and there, it's very entertaining as hell. The strongest element aside from the excellent direction, is the cast. We have Sean Connery, Sam Neill, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Tim Curry, James Earl Jones, Stellan Skarsgard and Jeffrey Jones to name a few. The acting is top notch all around with the highlights being Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin. The only thing that bothered me a lot was the terrible line deliveries in Russian. For a person who has an excellent ear for languages, it felt so out of place and borderline hilarious. But when they start all speaking English it's fine but the first 10 or so minutes are very awkward to watch. From the technical side of things, The Hunt for Red October is great. Lots of practical effects and real locations used for great effect. If they spared the terrible early 90's CGI, it would have felt more timeless and less dated. Just like Das Boot, John McTiernan knows how to create tension and suspense without showing much. It's not as good as Das Boot but still does a fine job. The skillful direction elevates the painfully mediocre and convoluted script considerably. Plot and characters are were The Hunt for Red October falls short. The plot is beyond convoluted and there are many moments you keep scratching your head in confusion. Also some of the characters like the rock star sonar technician were too silly and just felt out place. All the problems are very minor and these small details doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. The Hunt for Red October is a quality early 90's thriller that will satisfy any fans of the Cold War themed films. By all means not the best Cold War thriller or the best submarine film, but easily of the better and more entertaining ones. If you like the cast and the idea of Sean Connery failing in Russian, this is a must see.

This is, of course, after he's already been driven to the airport in a fancy looking car amidst all the nondescript taxis inferring pre-eminence. Meanwhile, on board Ramius' vessel, the man speaks of doom-laden bible passages and we observe through the props littering his quarters an apparent fondness for a kind of warfare via the literature and certain paintings on show.

Such a statement will sound derogatory toward Die Hard. Rest assured, how that film was made was precisely how one should go about making such a film, but this is McTiernan proving he can operate at either ends of the scale. This is one of those all-star cast American 'event' films that happen to be really good instead of empty; overly long and fragmented by this insistence to provide its audience with episodic stunts that disguise its inability to provide a congealed experience of storytelling and depiction of character. The "action" consists of suited men in rooms arguing with one another; the "drama" the ambiguity surrounding a central character's actions.

    Am I alone in thinking Tom Clancy is overrated ? I did once have the misfortune of reading PATRIOT GAMES , you know the thriller where a bunch of Irish terrorists try to kill Jack Ryan because he foiled their plot to kidnap Charles and Diana , you know the thriller where Clancy bludgeons the reader over the head that these Irish terrorists aren't the ones belonging to the IRA but are an entirely different breed of ultra nasty baddies . Compared to the book the unconvincing film version of PATROIT GAMES is almost a fly on the wall documentary on the Irish troubles so after reading the book I didn't bother wasting any more of my life reading his novels . I do recall seeing a TV interview with the author where he claimed he spent six months researching the material for his novels then spent six months writing them . I guess he must be a very slow reader and typist in that case Many of the people on this page who have a Luke warm reaction to the source novel have unreservedly praised this cinematic adaptation and you can understand this . The story for what its worth is riddled with plot inconsistencies . Stop to consider why the Americans think Red October is planning a pre-emptive strike simply because it's sailing close to the United States since the whole point of these ICBM subs is to be able to target a target from anywhere in the world . Simply sailing close to the United States doesn't indicate anything . Likewise if the propulsion system is so effective how do the Americans have no problem detecting the sub while the Soviets can't ? Oh and if Captain Marko Ramius wanted to defect wouldn't he have found an easier way than steal a submarine ? You see if you stop to examine things everything falls apart very quickly . But there's two things that stop this . One is the fine cast. Sean Connery is one of these actors who has always had a very strong physical presence but continually appeared in material that had him miscast . This isn't the case here and it's impossible to think of anyone who would have been anywhere a good substitute as Ramius and he's ably supported by an excellent international cast . Even Tim Curry is convincing in his small role The second saving grace is the impressive cinematography by Jan de Bont . One irritating aspect of film making in the 21st Century is the number of films that all have the same look regardless of who the director of photography is , British in particular suffer from this and it's become a lost art these days with rare notable exceptions such as Roger Deakins . This film sees a cinematographer on top of his game where lighting and colour scheme is concerned

    This movie is based on a Tom Clancy novel of the same name. It is about a Russian Submarine captain, Rameus, who wishes to defect to the United States because his faith in the system has vanished. The themes in this movie revolve around the arms race, a first strike war policy, and immoral policy decisions. The Russians have created a submarine with a silent drive. As such, it can sneak up on the American shore and launch missiles at them without being detected. It is very much a first strike weapon and Rameus does not like this because policy makers in the Kremlin have created it simply to start a war. This is the whole idea of the policy decisions. Rameus respects his motherland, but has come to the conclusion that such a weapon is designed to start a war, not end it and as such he does not want a part of it. In the end he decides that he has had enough and leaves. It is ironic that even though this sub has a silent engine, one American submarine is able to track it. It knows what its signature sounds like and this seems to defeat the entire purpose of this silent engine. The thing that irked me about this movie is that the Russians are the bad guys and the Americans are the good guys. This was set during the Cold War and as such patriotism was required. The thing is that the politician in this movie is a liar and a cheat - a real slime bag, yet he comes out on top and the Russians are portrayed as being the idiots. The Americans land up with this first strike weapon and the Russians lose out big time. This is not surprising because the author is American and he is writing at a time when the Russians were bad and Americans were good. Yet this was written during the time I was a teenager and as such we loved the Russians because they were the bad guys and our parents (mine especially) would constantly rave about how bad they were. In the end I sympathise with the Russians because I do not see them as the evil empire, but rather the other side in a war in which can only be one winner. History is written by the victors and the victors are always seen as being the good guys, even though they probably are not. This is clear when we see the slimy politician in this movie. He is slime yet he is on the side of the winners - though I would hardly call him a good guy. Anyway, I still quite like this movie, and was disappointed with the sequels as they removed Alec Baldwin and replaced him with Harrison Ford. I hate it when they do that.

    The Hunt for Red October is a thriller based on the novel of the same name by Tom Clancy. It was directed by John McTiernan and stars Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin.This was the first of several films based on Tom Clancy's thrillers that presents eccentric CIA analyst Jack Ryan. The year was 1984. Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius sets the plot in motion when he murders his political adviser, burns his orders, and steers his submarine,Red October towards American waters, hoping to defect. The CIA, aware that the Red October was about to embark on an evasive mission to demonstrate its ability to avoid detection and fire its nuclear missiles upon U.S. installations, believes that Ramius is insane, and that he plans to start World War III. To cover their own behinds, the Russians back up the CIA's suspicion. Only Jack Ryan believes that Ramius' mission is not as apocalyptic as it seems -- and it is Ryan who is assigned to infiltrate the Red October to prove his theory. The first Jack Ryan thriller film is a supremely mounted film and well acted by Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery as Jack Ryan and Marko Ramius respectively.It was vastly enjoyable and entertaining that one will not regret watching it and spending many hours discussing about it after viewing the film.And most of all,it was a great adaptation of Tom Clancy's novel.

    Tom Clancy was almost a sleeper hit, in the novel world, anyways, back in the 1980's, and this first film in the Jack Ryan movie adaptations, is a true wonder. Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Sam Niell, James Earl Jones, and more big stars fill the screen in good, sometimes great performances that just enhance the experience. The film shines in the way that it explores submarines, not just the insides in a way like a documentary, but the mood of the sub, the way you could at almost anytime fire a missile and eliminate a city, the duty a seaman has and the pressure he is under with millions and billions of dollars of taxpayers money, and it is almost a haunting film at times, aided by Basil Poledouris' brilliant score. As for the Jack Ryan character, Alec Baldwin, I must admit, gives a realist performance as an up and excited guy who is an analyst on his first field job, sort of, that is. A great film also in its story, and a pace that is seemingly slow at times, but it works nonetheless.

    "The Hunt For Red October" is a 1990 film directed by John McTiernan and stars Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery. The film is adapted from the 1984 Tom Clancy novel about a Soviet nuclear submarine which drops off U.S. scanners, prompting a young CIA analyst (Baldwin) to scramble to find out what the captain's (Connery) motives really are. To start off, I love Tom Clancy. I'm a fairly big fan of his Splinter Cell, Rainbow SIx, and Ghost Recon franchises. I had also heard of "Red October" and that it was directed by the guy who made "Predator" and "Die Hard", so I was already pretty excited to watch this movie. In short, the film did not, in any way, disappoint. What kind of shocked and worried me about this is that this film was filed under the "Thriller" section on Netflix. . .and it's rated PG. Needless to say, this fact sort of worried me. I was wrong though - just because this movie is PG does not mean it isn't "thrilling" in any sense of the word. "Red October" is in fact an "edge of your seat" thriller by definition. Almost every facet of this film is excellent. The script, I found, was very witty and well written by Larry Ferguson. The acting was spectacular, specifically of course from Connery and Baldwin. The score was very awesome and appropriate for the source material. The special effects were very good, especially for the late 80's. I'd say that "The Hunt For Red October" is a solid thriller that will have a hard time disappointing many of its viewers.

    After two seminal action films, director John McTiernan shifts towards political suspense thriller territory with very impressive results. The strength of this thriller is the a lot of the story and drama plays out through close ups and characters in confined spaces, and John McTiernan exploits this fully. The plot, adapted from the Tom Clancy novel, is sophisticated and involving, and congratulations go to screenwriters Larry Ferguson, Donald Stewart and John Milius(who did some un-credited work) for crafting a clever, suspenseful, well informed screenplay, peppered with moments of dry humour. Acting performances are fairly broad, and it is no surprise that despite a Scottish accent, Sean Connery's sheer charisma leads to yet another commanding performance that anchors the film. He is ably supported by the cast that plays his submarine crew, albeit for me Sam Neill seemed an unusual choice and didn't quite work. While in small role, Peter Firth is ideal in the political officer role, and Tim Curry is rather amusing as the slightly na&iuml;ve and sycophantic doctor. Alec Baldwin is surprisingly refreshing as the slightly out his depth analyst thrown into the front line, but his character rises to the challenge and becomes the reluctant hero in the end. He receives outstanding support from James Earl Jones, Scott Glenn, Courtney Vance, Anthony Peck, Richard Jordan and Joss Ackland. In fact all these performances are grounded and charismatic, albeit Richard Jordan's and Joss Ackland's diplomatic exchanges are the main vehicle for the film's humour, which plays out very cleverly in what is actually plot exposition for the audience. The production is also expertly crafted by director John McTiernan. He makes full use of Jan de Bont's first rate photography (they had collaborated on Die Hard), and together with production designer Terence Marsh and co-operation from the US Navy, leads to some great in camera set pieces. This is fully realised by Basil Poledouris's excellent score, which creates a truly terrific atmosphere, and the Oscar winning sound effects, that also help bring the audience into the film's settings. Sound editor Cecelia Hall was already a very experienced sound effects editor, having worked on a variety of films including Star Treks 2 and 3, Airplane II, Staying Alive, Beverly Hills Cops 1 & 2,Terms of Endearment, Top Gun, The Golden Child and Action Jackson. After her success on Red October, she would on other high profile films such as Days of Thunder, The Adams Family Movies and Patriot Games. She went on to be Senior Vice-President of Post Production Sound at Paramount, and works as a Professor at UCLA. George Walters II is one of Hollywood's most successful sound editors. After starting work in Hollywood in the seventies, his CV prior to Red October included work on the first three Star Trek movies, Staying Alive, Flash-dance, Beverly Hills Cop 1 & 2, Critical Condition, Crocodile Dundee 2, Naked Gun. After Red October, he continues to rack up first rate work on yet more films including Naked Gun 2.5, Patriot Games, Star Trek VI, The War, Crimson Tide, Broken Arrow, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon, Thomas Crown Affair, Pirates of the Caribbean 1 & 2, Enemy of the State including winning a second Oscar for best sound on Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour. Unfortunately the one failing in the film, despite all the excellent other technical contributions is the visual effects. While not terrible they are clearly not at the level of the rest of the film. Disagreements between director McTiernan and original visual supervisor Richard Edlund, heading up the BOSS fx house, led to the company being removed from the project late in post-production, and George Lucas's ILM having to come in to do a rush job to get something in place for the films March 1990 release. They had to make do with the models that had been built when BOSS was running the visual effects; using a smoked studio with the miniatures hanging from wires, and some subtle digital effects to help sell the illusion of being underwater. They managed to do a reasonable if unremarkable job (albeit the films budget did mushroom). For example the visual fx do not come close to the outstanding work that was done on James Cameron's The Abyss, whose underwater visual fx was so much better, even though that film came out nearly a year earlier(and had its own production problems). Tony Scott's Crimson Tide, that came five years later showed what underwater submarine visual fx should look like. However the film-makers do mitigate the poor quality through editing the shots in quick cuts which means they don't have the opportunity to pull you out of the story. Another clever albeit cynical approach is to blur the footage. This helps sell "underwater", but sometimes makes it difficult to see what is going on, and is a way of potentially hiding imperfections in the actual shot. Nevertheless, despite this the fact the rest of the film was so good allows the audience to still get a great deal of enjoyment out of an expertly crafted political thriller.

    I'll admit it. I don't like war movies. But "Hunt for Red October" is not a war movie, its a story about an era in human history: a story about comradery, friends, enemies, sober pausing at the edge of human destruction, the bomb :-) I watched this movie again and was struck by its power (again!). Its all-male casting makes it a true depiction of a men's world, except here the men are not lone wolves like Rambo, but rather family men trying to avoid the third world war, playing a clever game of cat and mouse with the enemy who is not always the stereotypical savage. When I first saw this as a 15 yo, I couldn't get over the awesome music: I watched the beginning credits on Sony Beta tape over and over again... I still listen to the soundtrack occasionally. If you haven't seen this, you must. You will fall in love with the intricate characters like the sonar operators, sub drivers, etc. The character performances and especially the dialog between soviet officers is absolutely brilliant. This movie is definitely way up there on my top 10 all time movies list.

    Easily the best film ever about a Russian sub captain with a Scottish accent. Actually he's of Lithuanian ancestry, but still... The first movie adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel, an adaptation of his very first one, this is also the first to feature his regular protagonist, Jack Ryan, played here by Alec Baldwin, who plays him quite well as the out-of-his-depth intelligence analyst. It is Sean Connery who dominates the film however as Red October's captain, Marko Ramius. Despite the accent, he is on excellent form throughout. The supporting cast are no slackers either - Sam Neill as Borodin, James Earl Jones as Ryan's mentor Admiral Greer, Scott Glenn as Bart Mancuso, Courtney B Vance as Jones. Underwater scenes often provide pacing problems, and while the models used never actually saw any water, there are a few moments when the pace threatens to sag. Fortunately, it never does, with some hair-raising moments such as the Dallas stalking Red October without the latter even aware they're there, and the climactic battle with the Alfa-class V K Konovolov. There are many other great scenes too such as Ryan's set-to with a saboteur, and the Red October's evasion of a torpedo launched from a 'Bear-Foxtrot'. Basil Poledouris' score is fantastic, lending the film an epic feel, while also ominous in more tense scenes. The film is not without flaws. Some of the effects weren't convincing even in 1990. There are moments when the Red October looks every bit a model, an external shot of a 'Bear-Foxtrot' never looks anything less than one. It would appear a bit of corner-cutting went on with the budget. Witness an F-14 about to crash suddenly turn into vintage footage of an old 50s Grumman F9F. The same shot of a torpedo being dropped from into sea is used twice, once for the Bear, and another for an SH-60 Seahawk. While far more believable than most spy thrillers, a few changes take away from the realism that the book's author is often praised for. The manner in which Jack concludes what Ramius is up to for instance seems awfully contrived - the evidence he bases his conclusion on in the book was actually more simple and perfectly reasonable. Caveats aside, this remains a high point in Cold War cinema, coming out just as that era was effectively over.

    The Hunt For Red October is a quality thriller from one the better action directors of late 80's and early 90's John McTiernan. It features an excellent ensemble cast, convoluted Cold War plot and Sean Connery at his very Connery best. While at times it feels dated and has some annoying clich&eacute;s here and there, it's very entertaining as hell. The strongest element aside from the excellent direction, is the cast. We have Sean Connery, Sam Neill, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Tim Curry, James Earl Jones, Stellan Skarsgard and Jeffrey Jones to name a few. The acting is top notch all around with the highlights being Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin. The only thing that bothered me a lot was the terrible line deliveries in Russian. For a person who has an excellent ear for languages, it felt so out of place and borderline hilarious. But when they start all speaking English it's fine but the first 10 or so minutes are very awkward to watch. From the technical side of things, The Hunt for Red October is great. Lots of practical effects and real locations used for great effect. If they spared the terrible early 90's CGI, it would have felt more timeless and less dated. Just like Das Boot, John McTiernan knows how to create tension and suspense without showing much. It's not as good as Das Boot but still does a fine job. The skillful direction elevates the painfully mediocre and convoluted script considerably. Plot and characters are were The Hunt for Red October falls short. The plot is beyond convoluted and there are many moments you keep scratching your head in confusion. Also some of the characters like the rock star sonar technician were too silly and just felt out place. All the problems are very minor and these small details doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. The Hunt for Red October is a quality early 90's thriller that will satisfy any fans of the Cold War themed films. By all means not the best Cold War thriller or the best submarine film, but easily of the better and more entertaining ones. If you like the cast and the idea of Sean Connery failing in Russian, this is a must see.

    After the pent up, singular set shenanigans of Die Hard comes the grandeur, submarines and warships set, more narratively driven espionage thriller of The Hunt for Red October; John McTiernan's follow up to an action film masterpiece which, itself, is a bit of an action film masterpiece anyway. The film is a nourishing piece; carrying with it a genuine sense of there being craft at hand, a two hour plus piece which rattles along because it's depicting characters and doing well with its premise. Here is the English language thriller that depicts secret agents; nuclear submarines and a general sense of chase, but is happens to be gripping and smart. Where did the process of forcing us to sit stuck in a film's icy grip of ill thought filmmaking, as poorly put together set pieces are spoon fed to us, suddenly vanish to? Aside from the obvious Soviet connotations, the film's immediate opening calls to mind Sergei Eisenstein's montage editing experiment of the 1920s, when three separate objects were inter-cut with a lone man's reaction: To which item was he reacting? Was it all three? How was he reacting to each item? How do we interpret his reaction? When we observe Sean Connery's Russian naval captain Marko Ramius stand aboard his submarine, shortly before it delves below into the depths of the icy ocean and away, we are allowed entry into his 'looking' out at the snowy tips that make up the tail end of whatever stretches of land this is that still constitutes as the Soviet Union. Through a similar method to Eisenstein, McTiernan allows us this "person/item/reaction" structure in his editing of the opening scene. The film's IMDb pitch reads: "the USSR's best submarine captain in their newest sub violates orders and heads for the USA. Is he trying to defect, or to start a war?" - if you know you're cinema, and with all this in mind, you might be able to work out the truth behind such a premise from this cine-literate process of montage construction, something that's revealed ninety minutes later anyway. That's not to degrade the film for being predictable; on the contrary, the film is a remarkably well constructed drama which toys with this premise and sews in a lot of other material wonderfully well. With this rouge Russian submarine loose, the Americans call in the man they have employed in the C.I.A. so as to aid them in their action against it. This man is Jack Ryan, here played by Alec Baldwin; an agent working with a government organisation and a man whose smooth named invokes the likes of "James Bond"; a man whose existence extends to the knowing of the precise dynamics that makes up turbulence before he flirts with a stewardess who's working on board the plane he's using to fly to The States from his home in London. This is, of course, after he's already been driven to the airport in a fancy looking car amidst all the nondescript taxis inferring pre-eminence. Meanwhile, on board Ramius' vessel, the man speaks of doom-laden bible passages and we observe through the props littering his quarters an apparent fondness for a kind of warfare via the literature and certain paintings on show. The unrest extends to the fact one of his crew does well to infiltrate the man's domain before appearing to be killed with Ramius' own bare hands. How the Soviets themselves react is through distributing a second submarine to go after Ramius, with a scattershot Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd character in charge, and whose intentions are to bring Ramius down. The film will spill out into a suspicion and distrust laden piece wherein the dynamic will read something along the lines of the Soviets, who're on the ground, are too stunned by what the Soviets underwater are doing who themselves are confusing the Americans in their submarine underwater who're themselves frightening the Americans on the ground with their actions. This is cut adrift of the gunfire and shooting of Die Hard, ingredients of which indeed make up most English language American action thrillers. But here is a film which, much later on, has a character reveal a gun. Its presence is actually quite startling, if only for the fact we'd completely forgotten about the very existence of such things, and now that one has been introduced into the fray, we're so much more aware of what damage it might induce than we have most probably of any firearm in any proceedings film of The Hunt for Red October's ilk. Such a statement will sound derogatory toward Die Hard. Rest assured, how that film was made was precisely how one should go about making such a film, but this is McTiernan proving he can operate at either ends of the scale. This is one of those all-star cast American 'event' films that happen to be really good instead of empty; overly long and fragmented by this insistence to provide its audience with episodic stunts that disguise its inability to provide a congealed experience of storytelling and depiction of character. The "action" consists of suited men in rooms arguing with one another; the "drama" the ambiguity surrounding a central character's actions.

    This movie is based on a Tom Clancy novel of the same name. It is about a Russian Submarine captain, Rameus, who wishes to defect to the United States because his faith in the system has vanished. The themes in this movie revolve around the arms race, a first strike war policy, and immoral policy decisions. The Russians have created a submarine with a silent drive.

    The Hunt for Red October is a thriller based on the novel of the same name by Tom Clancy. It was directed by John McTiernan and stars Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin.This was the first of several films based on Tom Clancy's thrillers that presents eccentric CIA analyst Jack Ryan. The year was 1984. Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius sets the plot in motion when he murders his political adviser, burns his orders, and steers his submarine,Red October towards American waters, hoping to defect. The CIA, aware that the Red October was about to embark on an evasive mission to demonstrate its ability to avoid detection and fire its nuclear missiles upon U.S. installations, believes that Ramius is insane, and that he plans to start World War III. To cover their own behinds, the Russians back up the CIA's suspicion. Only Jack Ryan believes that Ramius' mission is not as apocalyptic as it seems -- and it is Ryan who is assigned to infiltrate the Red October to prove his theory. The first Jack Ryan thriller film is a supremely mounted film and well acted by Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery as Jack Ryan and Marko Ramius respectively.It was vastly enjoyable and entertaining that one will not regret watching it and spending many hours discussing about it after viewing the film.And most of all,it was a great adaptation of Tom Clancy's novel.

    Tom Clancy was almost a sleeper hit, in the novel world, anyways, back in the 1980's, and this first film in the Jack Ryan movie adaptations, is a true wonder. Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Sam Niell, James Earl Jones, and more big stars fill the screen in good, sometimes great performances that just enhance the experience. The film shines in the way that it explores submarines, not just the insides in a way like a documentary, but the mood of the sub, the way you could at almost anytime fire a missile and eliminate a city, the duty a seaman has and the pressure he is under with millions and billions of dollars of taxpayers money, and it is almost a haunting film at times, aided by Basil Poledouris' brilliant score. As for the Jack Ryan character, Alec Baldwin, I must admit, gives a realist performance as an up and excited guy who is an analyst on his first field job, sort of, that is. A great film also in its story, and a pace that is seemingly slow at times, but it works nonetheless.

    "The Hunt For Red October" is a 1990 film directed by John McTiernan and stars Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery. The film is adapted from the 1984 Tom Clancy novel about a Soviet nuclear submarine which drops off U.S. scanners, prompting a young CIA analyst (Baldwin) to scramble to find out what the captain's (Connery) motives really are. To start off, I love Tom Clancy. I'm a fairly big fan of his Splinter Cell, Rainbow SIx, and Ghost Recon franchises. I had also heard of "Red October" and that it was directed by the guy who made "Predator" and "Die Hard", so I was already pretty excited to watch this movie. In short, the film did not, in any way, disappoint. What kind of shocked and worried me about this is that this film was filed under the "Thriller" section on Netflix. . .and it's rated PG. Needless to say, this fact sort of worried me. I was wrong though - just because this movie is PG does not mean it isn't "thrilling" in any sense of the word. "Red October" is in fact an "edge of your seat" thriller by definition. Almost every facet of this film is excellent. The script, I found, was very witty and well written by Larry Ferguson. The acting was spectacular, specifically of course from Connery and Baldwin. The score was very awesome and appropriate for the source material. The special effects were very good, especially for the late 80's. I'd say that "The Hunt For Red October" is a solid thriller that will have a hard time disappointing many of its viewers.

    After two seminal action films, director John McTiernan shifts towards political suspense thriller territory with very impressive results. The strength of this thriller is the a lot of the story and drama plays out through close ups and characters in confined spaces, and John McTiernan exploits this fully. The plot, adapted from the Tom Clancy novel, is sophisticated and involving, and congratulations go to screenwriters Larry Ferguson, Donald Stewart and John Milius(who did some un-credited work) for crafting a clever, suspenseful, well informed screenplay, peppered with moments of dry humour. Acting performances are fairly broad, and it is no surprise that despite a Scottish accent, Sean Connery's sheer charisma leads to yet another commanding performance that anchors the film. He is ably supported by the cast that plays his submarine crew, albeit for me Sam Neill seemed an unusual choice and didn't quite work. While in small role, Peter Firth is ideal in the political officer role, and Tim Curry is rather amusing as the slightly na&iuml;ve and sycophantic doctor. Alec Baldwin is surprisingly refreshing as the slightly out his depth analyst thrown into the front line, but his character rises to the challenge and becomes the reluctant hero in the end. He receives outstanding support from James Earl Jones, Scott Glenn, Courtney Vance, Anthony Peck, Richard Jordan and Joss Ackland. In fact all these performances are grounded and charismatic, albeit Richard Jordan's and Joss Ackland's diplomatic exchanges are the main vehicle for the film's humour, which plays out very cleverly in what is actually plot exposition for the audience. The production is also expertly crafted by director John McTiernan. He makes full use of Jan de Bont's first rate photography (they had collaborated on Die Hard), and together with production designer Terence Marsh and co-operation from the US Navy, leads to some great in camera set pieces. This is fully realised by Basil Poledouris's excellent score, which creates a truly terrific atmosphere, and the Oscar winning sound effects, that also help bring the audience into the film's settings. Sound editor Cecelia Hall was already a very experienced sound effects editor, having worked on a variety of films including Star Treks 2 and 3, Airplane II, Staying Alive, Beverly Hills Cops 1 & 2,Terms of Endearment, Top Gun, The Golden Child and Action Jackson. After her success on Red October, she would on other high profile films such as Days of Thunder, The Adams Family Movies and Patriot Games. She went on to be Senior Vice-President of Post Production Sound at Paramount, and works as a Professor at UCLA. George Walters II is one of Hollywood's most successful sound editors. After starting work in Hollywood in the seventies, his CV prior to Red October included work on the first three Star Trek movies, Staying Alive, Flash-dance, Beverly Hills Cop 1 & 2, Critical Condition, Crocodile Dundee 2, Naked Gun. After Red October, he continues to rack up first rate work on yet more films including Naked Gun 2.5, Patriot Games, Star Trek VI, The War, Crimson Tide, Broken Arrow, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon, Thomas Crown Affair, Pirates of the Caribbean 1 & 2, Enemy of the State including winning a second Oscar for best sound on Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour. Unfortunately the one failing in the film, despite all the excellent other technical contributions is the visual effects. While not terrible they are clearly not at the level of the rest of the film. Disagreements between director McTiernan and original visual supervisor Richard Edlund, heading up the BOSS fx house, led to the company being removed from the project late in post-production, and George Lucas's ILM having to come in to do a rush job to get something in place for the films March 1990 release. They had to make do with the models that had been built when BOSS was running the visual effects; using a smoked studio with the miniatures hanging from wires, and some subtle digital effects to help sell the illusion of being underwater. They managed to do a reasonable if unremarkable job (albeit the films budget did mushroom). For example the visual fx do not come close to the outstanding work that was done on James Cameron's The Abyss, whose underwater visual fx was so much better, even though that film came out nearly a year earlier(and had its own production problems). Tony Scott's Crimson Tide, that came five years later showed what underwater submarine visual fx should look like. However the film-makers do mitigate the poor quality through editing the shots in quick cuts which means they don't have the opportunity to pull you out of the story. Another clever albeit cynical approach is to blur the footage. This helps sell "underwater", but sometimes makes it difficult to see what is going on, and is a way of potentially hiding imperfections in the actual shot. Nevertheless, despite this the fact the rest of the film was so good allows the audience to still get a great deal of enjoyment out of an expertly crafted political thriller.

    I'll admit it. I don't like war movies. But "Hunt for Red October" is not a war movie, its a story about an era in human history: a story about comradery, friends, enemies, sober pausing at the edge of human destruction, the bomb :-) I watched this movie again and was struck by its power (again!). Its all-male casting makes it a true depiction of a men's world, except here the men are not lone wolves like Rambo, but rather family men trying to avoid the third world war, playing a clever game of cat and mouse with the enemy who is not always the stereotypical savage. When I first saw this as a 15 yo, I couldn't get over the awesome music: I watched the beginning credits on Sony Beta tape over and over again... I still listen to the soundtrack occasionally. If you haven't seen this, you must. You will fall in love with the intricate characters like the sonar operators, sub drivers, etc. The character performances and especially the dialog between soviet officers is absolutely brilliant. This movie is definitely way up there on my top 10 all time movies list.

    Easily the best film ever about a Russian sub captain with a Scottish accent. Actually he's of Lithuanian ancestry, but still... The first movie adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel, an adaptation of his very first one, this is also the first to feature his regular protagonist, Jack Ryan, played here by Alec Baldwin, who plays him quite well as the out-of-his-depth intelligence analyst. It is Sean Connery who dominates the film however as Red October's captain, Marko Ramius. Despite the accent, he is on excellent form throughout. The supporting cast are no slackers either - Sam Neill as Borodin, James Earl Jones as Ryan's mentor Admiral Greer, Scott Glenn as Bart Mancuso, Courtney B Vance as Jones. Underwater scenes often provide pacing problems, and while the models used never actually saw any water, there are a few moments when the pace threatens to sag. Fortunately, it never does, with some hair-raising moments such as the Dallas stalking Red October without the latter even aware they're there, and the climactic battle with the Alfa-class V K Konovolov. There are many other great scenes too such as Ryan's set-to with a saboteur, and the Red October's evasion of a torpedo launched from a 'Bear-Foxtrot'. Basil Poledouris' score is fantastic, lending the film an epic feel, while also ominous in more tense scenes. The film is not without flaws. Some of the effects weren't convincing even in 1990. There are moments when the Red October looks every bit a model, an external shot of a 'Bear-Foxtrot' never looks anything less than one. It would appear a bit of corner-cutting went on with the budget. Witness an F-14 about to crash suddenly turn into vintage footage of an old 50s Grumman F9F. The same shot of a torpedo being dropped from into sea is used twice, once for the Bear, and another for an SH-60 Seahawk. While far more believable than most spy thrillers, a few changes take away from the realism that the book's author is often praised for. The manner in which Jack concludes what Ramius is up to for instance seems awfully contrived - the evidence he bases his conclusion on in the book was actually more simple and perfectly reasonable. Caveats aside, this remains a high point in Cold War cinema, coming out just as that era was effectively over.

    The Hunt For Red October is a quality thriller from one the better action directors of late 80's and early 90's John McTiernan. It features an excellent ensemble cast, convoluted Cold War plot and Sean Connery at his very Connery best. While at times it feels dated and has some annoying clich&eacute;s here and there, it's very entertaining as hell. The strongest element aside from the excellent direction, is the cast. We have Sean Connery, Sam Neill, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Tim Curry, James Earl Jones, Stellan Skarsgard and Jeffrey Jones to name a few. The acting is top notch all around with the highlights being Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin. The only thing that bothered me a lot was the terrible line deliveries in Russian. For a person who has an excellent ear for languages, it felt so out of place and borderline hilarious. But when they start all speaking English it's fine but the first 10 or so minutes are very awkward to watch. From the technical side of things, The Hunt for Red October is great. Lots of practical effects and real locations used for great effect. If they spared the terrible early 90's CGI, it would have felt more timeless and less dated. Just like Das Boot, John McTiernan knows how to create tension and suspense without showing much. It's not as good as Das Boot but still does a fine job. The skillful direction elevates the painfully mediocre and convoluted script considerably. Plot and characters are were The Hunt for Red October falls short. The plot is beyond convoluted and there are many moments you keep scratching your head in confusion. Also some of the characters like the rock star sonar technician were too silly and just felt out place. All the problems are very minor and these small details doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. The Hunt for Red October is a quality early 90's thriller that will satisfy any fans of the Cold War themed films. By all means not the best Cold War thriller or the best submarine film, but easily of the better and more entertaining ones. If you like the cast and the idea of Sean Connery failing in Russian, this is a must see.

    After the pent up, singular set shenanigans of Die Hard comes the grandeur, submarines and warships set, more narratively driven espionage thriller of The Hunt for Red October; John McTiernan's follow up to an action film masterpiece which, itself, is a bit of an action film masterpiece anyway. The film is a nourishing piece; carrying with it a genuine sense of there being craft at hand, a two hour plus piece which rattles along because it's depicting characters and doing well with its premise. Here is the English language thriller that depicts secret agents; nuclear submarines and a general sense of chase, but is happens to be gripping and smart. Where did the process of forcing us to sit stuck in a film's icy grip of ill thought filmmaking, as poorly put together set pieces are spoon fed to us, suddenly vanish to? Aside from the obvious Soviet connotations, the film's immediate opening calls to mind Sergei Eisenstein's montage editing experiment of the 1920s, when three separate objects were inter-cut with a lone man's reaction: To which item was he reacting? Was it all three? How was he reacting to each item? How do we interpret his reaction? When we observe Sean Connery's Russian naval captain Marko Ramius stand aboard his submarine, shortly before it delves below into the depths of the icy ocean and away, we are allowed entry into his 'looking' out at the snowy tips that make up the tail end of whatever stretches of land this is that still constitutes as the Soviet Union. Through a similar method to Eisenstein, McTiernan allows us this "person/item/reaction" structure in his editing of the opening scene. The film's IMDb pitch reads: "the USSR's best submarine captain in their newest sub violates orders and heads for the USA. Is he trying to defect, or to start a war?" - if you know you're cinema, and with all this in mind, you might be able to work out the truth behind such a premise from this cine-literate process of montage construction, something that's revealed ninety minutes later anyway. That's not to degrade the film for being predictable; on the contrary, the film is a remarkably well constructed drama which toys with this premise and sews in a lot of other material wonderfully well. With this rouge Russian submarine loose, the Americans call in the man they have employed in the C.I.A. so as to aid them in their action against it. This man is Jack Ryan, here played by Alec Baldwin; an agent working with a government organisation and a man whose smooth named invokes the likes of "James Bond"; a man whose existence extends to the knowing of the precise dynamics that makes up turbulence before he flirts with a stewardess who's working on board the plane he's using to fly to The States from his home in London. This is, of course, after he's already been driven to the airport in a fancy looking car amidst all the nondescript taxis inferring pre-eminence. Meanwhile, on board Ramius' vessel, the man speaks of doom-laden bible passages and we observe through the props littering his quarters an apparent fondness for a kind of warfare via the literature and certain paintings on show. The unrest extends to the fact one of his crew does well to infiltrate the man's domain before appearing to be killed with Ramius' own bare hands. How the Soviets themselves react is through distributing a second submarine to go after Ramius, with a scattershot Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd character in charge, and whose intentions are to bring Ramius down. The film will spill out into a suspicion and distrust laden piece wherein the dynamic will read something along the lines of the Soviets, who're on the ground, are too stunned by what the Soviets underwater are doing who themselves are confusing the Americans in their submarine underwater who're themselves frightening the Americans on the ground with their actions. This is cut adrift of the gunfire and shooting of Die Hard, ingredients of which indeed make up most English language American action thrillers. But here is a film which, much later on, has a character reveal a gun. Its presence is actually quite startling, if only for the fact we'd completely forgotten about the very existence of such things, and now that one has been introduced into the fray, we're so much more aware of what damage it might induce than we have most probably of any firearm in any proceedings film of The Hunt for Red October's ilk. Such a statement will sound derogatory toward Die Hard. Rest assured, how that film was made was precisely how one should go about making such a film, but this is McTiernan proving he can operate at either ends of the scale. This is one of those all-star cast American 'event' films that happen to be really good instead of empty; overly long and fragmented by this insistence to provide its audience with episodic stunts that disguise its inability to provide a congealed experience of storytelling and depiction of character. The "action" consists of suited men in rooms arguing with one another; the "drama" the ambiguity surrounding a central character's actions.

    Am I alone in thinking Tom Clancy is overrated ? I did once have the misfortune of reading PATRIOT GAMES , you know the thriller where a bunch of Irish terrorists try to kill Jack Ryan because he foiled their plot to kidnap Charles and Diana , you know the thriller where Clancy bludgeons the reader over the head that these Irish terrorists aren't the ones belonging to the IRA but are an entirely different breed of ultra nasty baddies . Compared to the book the unconvincing film version of PATROIT GAMES is almost a fly on the wall documentary on the Irish troubles so after reading the book I didn't bother wasting any more of my life reading his novels . I do recall seeing a TV interview with the author where he claimed he spent six months researching the material for his novels then spent six months writing them . I guess he must be a very slow reader and typist in that case Many of the people on this page who have a Luke warm reaction to the source novel have unreservedly praised this cinematic adaptation and you can understand this . The story for what its worth is riddled with plot inconsistencies . Stop to consider why the Americans think Red October is planning a pre-emptive strike simply because it's sailing close to the United States since the whole point of these ICBM subs is to be able to target a target from anywhere in the world . Simply sailing close to the United States doesn't indicate anything . Likewise if the propulsion system is so effective how do the Americans have no problem detecting the sub while the Soviets can't ? Oh and if Captain Marko Ramius wanted to defect wouldn't he have found an easier way than steal a submarine ? You see if you stop to examine things everything falls apart very quickly . But there's two things that stop this . One is the fine cast. Sean Connery is one of these actors who has always had a very strong physical presence but continually appeared in material that had him miscast . This isn't the case here and it's impossible to think of anyone who would have been anywhere a good substitute as Ramius and he's ably supported by an excellent international cast . Even Tim Curry is convincing in his small role The second saving grace is the impressive cinematography by Jan de Bont . One irritating aspect of film making in the 21st Century is the number of films that all have the same look regardless of who the director of photography is , British in particular suffer from this and it's become a lost art these days with rare notable exceptions such as Roger Deakins . This film sees a cinematographer on top of his game where lighting and colour scheme is concerned

    This movie is based on a Tom Clancy novel of the same name. It is about a Russian Submarine captain, Rameus, who wishes to defect to the United States because his faith in the system has vanished. The themes in this movie revolve around the arms race, a first strike war policy, and immoral policy decisions. The Russians have created a submarine with a silent drive. As such, it can sneak up on the American shore and launch missiles at them without being detected. It is very much a first strike weapon and Rameus does not like this because policy makers in the Kremlin have created it simply to start a war. This is the whole idea of the policy decisions. Rameus respects his motherland, but has come to the conclusion that such a weapon is designed to start a war, not end it and as such he does not want a part of it. In the end he decides that he has had enough and leaves. It is ironic that even though this sub has a silent engine, one American submarine is able to track it. It knows what its signature sounds like and this seems to defeat the entire purpose of this silent engine. The thing that irked me about this movie is that the Russians are the bad guys and the Americans are the good guys. This was set during the Cold War and as such patriotism was required. The thing is that the politician in this movie is a liar and a cheat - a real slime bag, yet he comes out on top and the Russians are portrayed as being the idiots. The Americans land up with this first strike weapon and the Russians lose out big time. This is not surprising because the author is American and he is writing at a time when the Russians were bad and Americans were good. Yet this was written during the time I was a teenager and as such we loved the Russians because they were the bad guys and our parents (mine especially) would constantly rave about how bad they were. In the end I sympathise with the Russians because I do not see them as the evil empire, but rather the other side in a war in which can only be one winner. History is written by the victors and the victors are always seen as being the good guys, even though they probably are not. This is clear when we see the slimy politician in this movie. He is slime yet he is on the side of the winners - though I would hardly call him a good guy. Anyway, I still quite like this movie, and was disappointed with the sequels as they removed Alec Baldwin and replaced him with Harrison Ford. I hate it when they do that.

A great film also in its story, and a pace that is seemingly slow at times, but it works nonetheless.

He receives outstanding support from James Earl Jones, Scott Glenn, Courtney Vance, Anthony Peck, Richard Jordan and Joss Ackland. In fact all these performances are grounded and charismatic, albeit Richard Jordan's and Joss Ackland's diplomatic exchanges are the main vehicle for the film's humour, which plays out very cleverly in what is actually plot exposition for the audience. The production is also expertly crafted by director John McTiernan. He makes full use of Jan de Bont's first rate photography (they had collaborated on Die Hard), and together with production designer Terence Marsh and co-operation from the US Navy, leads to some great in camera set pieces. This is fully realised by Basil Poledouris's excellent score, which creates a truly terrific atmosphere, and the Oscar winning sound effects, that also help bring the audience into the film's settings. Sound editor Cecelia Hall was already a very experienced sound effects editor, having worked on a variety of films including Star Treks 2 and 3, Airplane II, Staying Alive, Beverly Hills Cops 1 & 2,Terms of Endearment, Top Gun, The Golden Child and Action Jackson. After her success on Red October, she would on other high profile films such as Days of Thunder, The Adams Family Movies and Patriot Games. She went on to be Senior Vice-President of Post Production Sound at Paramount, and works as a Professor at UCLA. George Walters II is one of Hollywood's most successful sound editors. After starting work in Hollywood in the seventies, his CV prior to Red October included work on the first three Star Trek movies, Staying Alive, Flash-dance, Beverly Hills Cop 1 & 2, Critical Condition, Crocodile Dundee 2, Naked Gun. After Red October, he continues to rack up first rate work on yet more films including Naked Gun 2.5, Patriot Games, Star Trek VI, The War, Crimson Tide, Broken Arrow, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon, Thomas Crown Affair, Pirates of the Caribbean 1 & 2, Enemy of the State including winning a second Oscar for best sound on Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour. Unfortunately the one failing in the film, despite all the excellent other technical contributions is the visual effects. While not terrible they are clearly not at the level of the rest of the film. Disagreements between director McTiernan and original visual supervisor Richard Edlund, heading up the BOSS fx house, led to the company being removed from the project late in post-production, and George Lucas's ILM having to come in to do a rush job to get something in place for the films March 1990 release. They had to make do with the models that had been built when BOSS was running the visual effects; using a smoked studio with the miniatures hanging from wires, and some subtle digital effects to help sell the illusion of being underwater. They managed to do a reasonable if unremarkable job (albeit the films budget did mushroom). For example the visual fx do not come close to the outstanding work that was done on James Cameron's The Abyss, whose underwater visual fx was so much better, even though that film came out nearly a year earlier(and had its own production problems). Tony Scott's Crimson Tide, that came five years later showed what underwater submarine visual fx should look like. However the film-makers do mitigate the poor quality through editing the shots in quick cuts which means they don't have the opportunity to pull you out of the story. Another clever albeit cynical approach is to blur the footage. This helps sell "underwater", but sometimes makes it difficult to see what is going on, and is a way of potentially hiding imperfections in the actual shot. Nevertheless, despite this the fact the rest of the film was so good allows the audience to still get a great deal of enjoyment out of an expertly crafted political thriller.

    I'll admit it. I don't like war movies. But "Hunt for Red October" is not a war movie, its a story about an era in human history: a story about comradery, friends, enemies, sober pausing at the edge of human destruction, the bomb :-) I watched this movie again and was struck by its power (again!). Its all-male casting makes it a true depiction of a men's world, except here the men are not lone wolves like Rambo, but rather family men trying to avoid the third world war, playing a clever game of cat and mouse with the enemy who is not always the stereotypical savage. When I first saw this as a 15 yo, I couldn't get over the awesome music: I watched the beginning credits on Sony Beta tape over and over again... I still listen to the soundtrack occasionally. If you haven't seen this, you must. You will fall in love with the intricate characters like the sonar operators, sub drivers, etc. The character performances and especially the dialog between soviet officers is absolutely brilliant. This movie is definitely way up there on my top 10 all time movies list.

    Easily the best film ever about a Russian sub captain with a Scottish accent. Actually he's of Lithuanian ancestry, but still... The first movie adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel, an adaptation of his very first one, this is also the first to feature his regular protagonist, Jack Ryan, played here by Alec Baldwin, who plays him quite well as the out-of-his-depth intelligence analyst. It is Sean Connery who dominates the film however as Red October's captain, Marko Ramius. Despite the accent, he is on excellent form throughout. The supporting cast are no slackers either - Sam Neill as Borodin, James Earl Jones as Ryan's mentor Admiral Greer, Scott Glenn as Bart Mancuso, Courtney B Vance as Jones. Underwater scenes often provide pacing problems, and while the models used never actually saw any water, there are a few moments when the pace threatens to sag. Fortunately, it never does, with some hair-raising moments such as the Dallas stalking Red October without the latter even aware they're there, and the climactic battle with the Alfa-class V K Konovolov. There are many other great scenes too such as Ryan's set-to with a saboteur, and the Red October's evasion of a torpedo launched from a 'Bear-Foxtrot'. Basil Poledouris' score is fantastic, lending the film an epic feel, while also ominous in more tense scenes. The film is not without flaws. Some of the effects weren't convincing even in 1990. There are moments when the Red October looks every bit a model, an external shot of a 'Bear-Foxtrot' never looks anything less than one. It would appear a bit of corner-cutting went on with the budget. Witness an F-14 about to crash suddenly turn into vintage footage of an old 50s Grumman F9F. The same shot of a torpedo being dropped from into sea is used twice, once for the Bear, and another for an SH-60 Seahawk. While far more believable than most spy thrillers, a few changes take away from the realism that the book's author is often praised for. The manner in which Jack concludes what Ramius is up to for instance seems awfully contrived - the evidence he bases his conclusion on in the book was actually more simple and perfectly reasonable. Caveats aside, this remains a high point in Cold War cinema, coming out just as that era was effectively over.

    The Hunt For Red October is a quality thriller from one the better action directors of late 80's and early 90's John McTiernan. It features an excellent ensemble cast, convoluted Cold War plot and Sean Connery at his very Connery best. While at times it feels dated and has some annoying clich&eacute;s here and there, it's very entertaining as hell. The strongest element aside from the excellent direction, is the cast. We have Sean Connery, Sam Neill, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Tim Curry, James Earl Jones, Stellan Skarsgard and Jeffrey Jones to name a few. The acting is top notch all around with the highlights being Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin. The only thing that bothered me a lot was the terrible line deliveries in Russian. For a person who has an excellent ear for languages, it felt so out of place and borderline hilarious. But when they start all speaking English it's fine but the first 10 or so minutes are very awkward to watch. From the technical side of things, The Hunt for Red October is great. Lots of practical effects and real locations used for great effect. If they spared the terrible early 90's CGI, it would have felt more timeless and less dated. Just like Das Boot, John McTiernan knows how to create tension and suspense without showing much. It's not as good as Das Boot but still does a fine job. The skillful direction elevates the painfully mediocre and convoluted script considerably. Plot and characters are were The Hunt for Red October falls short. The plot is beyond convoluted and there are many moments you keep scratching your head in confusion. Also some of the characters like the rock star sonar technician were too silly and just felt out place. All the problems are very minor and these small details doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. The Hunt for Red October is a quality early 90's thriller that will satisfy any fans of the Cold War themed films. By all means not the best Cold War thriller or the best submarine film, but easily of the better and more entertaining ones. If you like the cast and the idea of Sean Connery failing in Russian, this is a must see.

    After the pent up, singular set shenanigans of Die Hard comes the grandeur, submarines and warships set, more narratively driven espionage thriller of The Hunt for Red October; John McTiernan's follow up to an action film masterpiece which, itself, is a bit of an action film masterpiece anyway. The film is a nourishing piece; carrying with it a genuine sense of there being craft at hand, a two hour plus piece which rattles along because it's depicting characters and doing well with its premise. Here is the English language thriller that depicts secret agents; nuclear submarines and a general sense of chase, but is happens to be gripping and smart. Where did the process of forcing us to sit stuck in a film's icy grip of ill thought filmmaking, as poorly put together set pieces are spoon fed to us, suddenly vanish to? Aside from the obvious Soviet connotations, the film's immediate opening calls to mind Sergei Eisenstein's montage editing experiment of the 1920s, when three separate objects were inter-cut with a lone man's reaction: To which item was he reacting? Was it all three? How was he reacting to each item? How do we interpret his reaction? When we observe Sean Connery's Russian naval captain Marko Ramius stand aboard his submarine, shortly before it delves below into the depths of the icy ocean and away, we are allowed entry into his 'looking' out at the snowy tips that make up the tail end of whatever stretches of land this is that still constitutes as the Soviet Union. Through a similar method to Eisenstein, McTiernan allows us this "person/item/reaction" structure in his editing of the opening scene. The film's IMDb pitch reads: "the USSR's best submarine captain in their newest sub violates orders and heads for the USA. Is he trying to defect, or to start a war?" - if you know you're cinema, and with all this in mind, you might be able to work out the truth behind such a premise from this cine-literate process of montage construction, something that's revealed ninety minutes later anyway. That's not to degrade the film for being predictable; on the contrary, the film is a remarkably well constructed drama which toys with this premise and sews in a lot of other material wonderfully well. With this rouge Russian submarine loose, the Americans call in the man they have employed in the C.I.A. so as to aid them in their action against it. This man is Jack Ryan, here played by Alec Baldwin; an agent working with a government organisation and a man whose smooth named invokes the likes of "James Bond"; a man whose existence extends to the knowing of the precise dynamics that makes up turbulence before he flirts with a stewardess who's working on board the plane he's using to fly to The States from his home in London. This is, of course, after he's already been driven to the airport in a fancy looking car amidst all the nondescript taxis inferring pre-eminence. Meanwhile, on board Ramius' vessel, the man speaks of doom-laden bible passages and we observe through the props littering his quarters an apparent fondness for a kind of warfare via the literature and certain paintings on show. The unrest extends to the fact one of his crew does well to infiltrate the man's domain before appearing to be killed with Ramius' own bare hands. How the Soviets themselves react is through distributing a second submarine to go after Ramius, with a scattershot Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd character in charge, and whose intentions are to bring Ramius down. The film will spill out into a suspicion and distrust laden piece wherein the dynamic will read something along the lines of the Soviets, who're on the ground, are too stunned by what the Soviets underwater are doing who themselves are confusing the Americans in their submarine underwater who're themselves frightening the Americans on the ground with their actions. This is cut adrift of the gunfire and shooting of Die Hard, ingredients of which indeed make up most English language American action thrillers. But here is a film which, much later on, has a character reveal a gun. Its presence is actually quite startling, if only for the fact we'd completely forgotten about the very existence of such things, and now that one has been introduced into the fray, we're so much more aware of what damage it might induce than we have most probably of any firearm in any proceedings film of The Hunt for Red October's ilk. Such a statement will sound derogatory toward Die Hard. Rest assured, how that film was made was precisely how one should go about making such a film, but this is McTiernan proving he can operate at either ends of the scale. This is one of those all-star cast American 'event' films that happen to be really good instead of empty; overly long and fragmented by this insistence to provide its audience with episodic stunts that disguise its inability to provide a congealed experience of storytelling and depiction of character. The "action" consists of suited men in rooms arguing with one another; the "drama" the ambiguity surrounding a central character's actions.

    Am I alone in thinking Tom Clancy is overrated ? I did once have the misfortune of reading PATRIOT GAMES , you know the thriller where a bunch of Irish terrorists try to kill Jack Ryan because he foiled their plot to kidnap Charles and Diana , you know the thriller where Clancy bludgeons the reader over the head that these Irish terrorists aren't the ones belonging to the IRA but are an entirely different breed of ultra nasty baddies . Compared to the book the unconvincing film version of PATROIT GAMES is almost a fly on the wall documentary on the Irish troubles so after reading the book I didn't bother wasting any more of my life reading his novels . I do recall seeing a TV interview with the author where he claimed he spent six months researching the material for his novels then spent six months writing them . I guess he must be a very slow reader and typist in that case Many of the people on this page who have a Luke warm reaction to the source novel have unreservedly praised this cinematic adaptation and you can understand this . The story for what its worth is riddled with plot inconsistencies . Stop to consider why the Americans think Red October is planning a pre-emptive strike simply because it's sailing close to the United States since the whole point of these ICBM subs is to be able to target a target from anywhere in the world . Simply sailing close to the United States doesn't indicate anything . Likewise if the propulsion system is so effective how do the Americans have no problem detecting the sub while the Soviets can't ? Oh and if Captain Marko Ramius wanted to defect wouldn't he have found an easier way than steal a submarine ? You see if you stop to examine things everything falls apart very quickly . But there's two things that stop this . One is the fine cast. Sean Connery is one of these actors who has always had a very strong physical presence but continually appeared in material that had him miscast . This isn't the case here and it's impossible to think of anyone who would have been anywhere a good substitute as Ramius and he's ably supported by an excellent international cast . Even Tim Curry is convincing in his small role The second saving grace is the impressive cinematography by Jan de Bont . One irritating aspect of film making in the 21st Century is the number of films that all have the same look regardless of who the director of photography is , British in particular suffer from this and it's become a lost art these days with rare notable exceptions such as Roger Deakins . This film sees a cinematographer on top of his game where lighting and colour scheme is concerned

    This movie is based on a Tom Clancy novel of the same name. It is about a Russian Submarine captain, Rameus, who wishes to defect to the United States because his faith in the system has vanished. The themes in this movie revolve around the arms race, a first strike war policy, and immoral policy decisions. The Russians have created a submarine with a silent drive. As such, it can sneak up on the American shore and launch missiles at them without being detected. It is very much a first strike weapon and Rameus does not like this because policy makers in the Kremlin have created it simply to start a war. This is the whole idea of the policy decisions. Rameus respects his motherland, but has come to the conclusion that such a weapon is designed to start a war, not end it and as such he does not want a part of it. In the end he decides that he has had enough and leaves. It is ironic that even though this sub has a silent engine, one American submarine is able to track it. It knows what its signature sounds like and this seems to defeat the entire purpose of this silent engine. The thing that irked me about this movie is that the Russians are the bad guys and the Americans are the good guys. This was set during the Cold War and as such patriotism was required. The thing is that the politician in this movie is a liar and a cheat - a real slime bag, yet he comes out on top and the Russians are portrayed as being the idiots. The Americans land up with this first strike weapon and the Russians lose out big time. This is not surprising because the author is American and he is writing at a time when the Russians were bad and Americans were good. Yet this was written during the time I was a teenager and as such we loved the Russians because they were the bad guys and our parents (mine especially) would constantly rave about how bad they were. In the end I sympathise with the Russians because I do not see them as the evil empire, but rather the other side in a war in which can only be one winner. History is written by the victors and the victors are always seen as being the good guys, even though they probably are not. This is clear when we see the slimy politician in this movie. He is slime yet he is on the side of the winners - though I would hardly call him a good guy. Anyway, I still quite like this movie, and was disappointed with the sequels as they removed Alec Baldwin and replaced him with Harrison Ford. I hate it when they do that.

    The Hunt for Red October is a thriller based on the novel of the same name by Tom Clancy. It was directed by John McTiernan and stars Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin.This was the first of several films based on Tom Clancy's thrillers that presents eccentric CIA analyst Jack Ryan. The year was 1984. Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius sets the plot in motion when he murders his political adviser, burns his orders, and steers his submarine,Red October towards American waters, hoping to defect. The CIA, aware that the Red October was about to embark on an evasive mission to demonstrate its ability to avoid detection and fire its nuclear missiles upon U.S. installations, believes that Ramius is insane, and that he plans to start World War III. To cover their own behinds, the Russians back up the CIA's suspicion. Only Jack Ryan believes that Ramius' mission is not as apocalyptic as it seems -- and it is Ryan who is assigned to infiltrate the Red October to prove his theory. The first Jack Ryan thriller film is a supremely mounted film and well acted by Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery as Jack Ryan and Marko Ramius respectively.It was vastly enjoyable and entertaining that one will not regret watching it and spending many hours discussing about it after viewing the film.And most of all,it was a great adaptation of Tom Clancy's novel.

    Tom Clancy was almost a sleeper hit, in the novel world, anyways, back in the 1980's, and this first film in the Jack Ryan movie adaptations, is a true wonder. Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Sam Niell, James Earl Jones, and more big stars fill the screen in good, sometimes great performances that just enhance the experience. The film shines in the way that it explores submarines, not just the insides in a way like a documentary, but the mood of the sub, the way you could at almost anytime fire a missile and eliminate a city, the duty a seaman has and the pressure he is under with millions and billions of dollars of taxpayers money, and it is almost a haunting film at times, aided by Basil Poledouris' brilliant score. As for the Jack Ryan character, Alec Baldwin, I must admit, gives a realist performance as an up and excited guy who is an analyst on his first field job, sort of, that is. A great film also in its story, and a pace that is seemingly slow at times, but it works nonetheless.

    "The Hunt For Red October" is a 1990 film directed by John McTiernan and stars Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery. The film is adapted from the 1984 Tom Clancy novel about a Soviet nuclear submarine which drops off U.S. scanners, prompting a young CIA analyst (Baldwin) to scramble to find out what the captain's (Connery) motives really are. To start off, I love Tom Clancy. I'm a fairly big fan of his Splinter Cell, Rainbow SIx, and Ghost Recon franchises. I had also heard of "Red October" and that it was directed by the guy who made "Predator" and "Die Hard", so I was already pretty excited to watch this movie. In short, the film did not, in any way, disappoint. What kind of shocked and worried me about this is that this film was filed under the "Thriller" section on Netflix. . .and it's rated PG. Needless to say, this fact sort of worried me. I was wrong though - just because this movie is PG does not mean it isn't "thrilling" in any sense of the word. "Red October" is in fact an "edge of your seat" thriller by definition. Almost every facet of this film is excellent. The script, I found, was very witty and well written by Larry Ferguson. The acting was spectacular, specifically of course from Connery and Baldwin. The score was very awesome and appropriate for the source material. The special effects were very good, especially for the late 80's. I'd say that "The Hunt For Red October" is a solid thriller that will have a hard time disappointing many of its viewers.

    After two seminal action films, director John McTiernan shifts towards political suspense thriller territory with very impressive results. The strength of this thriller is the a lot of the story and drama plays out through close ups and characters in confined spaces, and John McTiernan exploits this fully. The plot, adapted from the Tom Clancy novel, is sophisticated and involving, and congratulations go to screenwriters Larry Ferguson, Donald Stewart and John Milius(who did some un-credited work) for crafting a clever, suspenseful, well informed screenplay, peppered with moments of dry humour. Acting performances are fairly broad, and it is no surprise that despite a Scottish accent, Sean Connery's sheer charisma leads to yet another commanding performance that anchors the film. He is ably supported by the cast that plays his submarine crew, albeit for me Sam Neill seemed an unusual choice and didn't quite work. While in small role, Peter Firth is ideal in the political officer role, and Tim Curry is rather amusing as the slightly na&iuml;ve and sycophantic doctor. Alec Baldwin is surprisingly refreshing as the slightly out his depth analyst thrown into the front line, but his character rises to the challenge and becomes the reluctant hero in the end. He receives outstanding support from James Earl Jones, Scott Glenn, Courtney Vance, Anthony Peck, Richard Jordan and Joss Ackland. In fact all these performances are grounded and charismatic, albeit Richard Jordan's and Joss Ackland's diplomatic exchanges are the main vehicle for the film's humour, which plays out very cleverly in what is actually plot exposition for the audience. The production is also expertly crafted by director John McTiernan. He makes full use of Jan de Bont's first rate photography (they had collaborated on Die Hard), and together with production designer Terence Marsh and co-operation from the US Navy, leads to some great in camera set pieces. This is fully realised by Basil Poledouris's excellent score, which creates a truly terrific atmosphere, and the Oscar winning sound effects, that also help bring the audience into the film's settings. Sound editor Cecelia Hall was already a very experienced sound effects editor, having worked on a variety of films including Star Treks 2 and 3, Airplane II, Staying Alive, Beverly Hills Cops 1 & 2,Terms of Endearment, Top Gun, The Golden Child and Action Jackson. After her success on Red October, she would on other high profile films such as Days of Thunder, The Adams Family Movies and Patriot Games. She went on to be Senior Vice-President of Post Production Sound at Paramount, and works as a Professor at UCLA. George Walters II is one of Hollywood's most successful sound editors. After starting work in Hollywood in the seventies, his CV prior to Red October included work on the first three Star Trek movies, Staying Alive, Flash-dance, Beverly Hills Cop 1 & 2, Critical Condition, Crocodile Dundee 2, Naked Gun. After Red October, he continues to rack up first rate work on yet more films including Naked Gun 2.5, Patriot Games, Star Trek VI, The War, Crimson Tide, Broken Arrow, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon, Thomas Crown Affair, Pirates of the Caribbean 1 & 2, Enemy of the State including winning a second Oscar for best sound on Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour. Unfortunately the one failing in the film, despite all the excellent other technical contributions is the visual effects. While not terrible they are clearly not at the level of the rest of the film. Disagreements between director McTiernan and original visual supervisor Richard Edlund, heading up the BOSS fx house, led to the company being removed from the project late in post-production, and George Lucas's ILM having to come in to do a rush job to get something in place for the films March 1990 release. They had to make do with the models that had been built when BOSS was running the visual effects; using a smoked studio with the miniatures hanging from wires, and some subtle digital effects to help sell the illusion of being underwater. They managed to do a reasonable if unremarkable job (albeit the films budget did mushroom). For example the visual fx do not come close to the outstanding work that was done on James Cameron's The Abyss, whose underwater visual fx was so much better, even though that film came out nearly a year earlier(and had its own production problems). Tony Scott's Crimson Tide, that came five years later showed what underwater submarine visual fx should look like. However the film-makers do mitigate the poor quality through editing the shots in quick cuts which means they don't have the opportunity to pull you out of the story. Another clever albeit cynical approach is to blur the footage. This helps sell "underwater", but sometimes makes it difficult to see what is going on, and is a way of potentially hiding imperfections in the actual shot. Nevertheless, despite this the fact the rest of the film was so good allows the audience to still get a great deal of enjoyment out of an expertly crafted political thriller.

    Easily the best film ever about a Russian sub captain with a Scottish accent. Actually he's of Lithuanian ancestry, but still... The first movie adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel, an adaptation of his very first one, this is also the first to feature his regular protagonist, Jack Ryan, played here by Alec Baldwin, who plays him quite well as the out-of-his-depth intelligence analyst. It is Sean Connery who dominates the film however as Red October's captain, Marko Ramius. Despite the accent, he is on excellent form throughout. The supporting cast are no slackers either - Sam Neill as Borodin, James Earl Jones as Ryan's mentor Admiral Greer, Scott Glenn as Bart Mancuso, Courtney B Vance as Jones. Underwater scenes often provide pacing problems, and while the models used never actually saw any water, there are a few moments when the pace threatens to sag. Fortunately, it never does, with some hair-raising moments such as the Dallas stalking Red October without the latter even aware they're there, and the climactic battle with the Alfa-class V K Konovolov. There are many other great scenes too such as Ryan's set-to with a saboteur, and the Red October's evasion of a torpedo launched from a 'Bear-Foxtrot'. Basil Poledouris' score is fantastic, lending the film an epic feel, while also ominous in more tense scenes. The film is not without flaws. Some of the effects weren't convincing even in 1990. There are moments when the Red October looks every bit a model, an external shot of a 'Bear-Foxtrot' never looks anything less than one. It would appear a bit of corner-cutting went on with the budget. Witness an F-14 about to crash suddenly turn into vintage footage of an old 50s Grumman F9F. The same shot of a torpedo being dropped from into sea is used twice, once for the Bear, and another for an SH-60 Seahawk. While far more believable than most spy thrillers, a few changes take away from the realism that the book's author is often praised for. The manner in which Jack concludes what Ramius is up to for instance seems awfully contrived - the evidence he bases his conclusion on in the book was actually more simple and perfectly reasonable. Caveats aside, this remains a high point in Cold War cinema, coming out just as that era was effectively over.

    The Hunt For Red October is a quality thriller from one the better action directors of late 80's and early 90's John McTiernan. It features an excellent ensemble cast, convoluted Cold War plot and Sean Connery at his very Connery best. While at times it feels dated and has some annoying clich&eacute;s here and there, it's very entertaining as hell. The strongest element aside from the excellent direction, is the cast. We have Sean Connery, Sam Neill, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Tim Curry, James Earl Jones, Stellan Skarsgard and Jeffrey Jones to name a few. The acting is top notch all around with the highlights being Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin. The only thing that bothered me a lot was the terrible line deliveries in Russian. For a person who has an excellent ear for languages, it felt so out of place and borderline hilarious. But when they start all speaking English it's fine but the first 10 or so minutes are very awkward to watch. From the technical side of things, The Hunt for Red October is great. Lots of practical effects and real locations used for great effect. If they spared the terrible early 90's CGI, it would have felt more timeless and less dated. Just like Das Boot, John McTiernan knows how to create tension and suspense without showing much. It's not as good as Das Boot but still does a fine job. The skillful direction elevates the painfully mediocre and convoluted script considerably. Plot and characters are were The Hunt for Red October falls short. The plot is beyond convoluted and there are many moments you keep scratching your head in confusion. Also some of the characters like the rock star sonar technician were too silly and just felt out place. All the problems are very minor and these small details doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. The Hunt for Red October is a quality early 90's thriller that will satisfy any fans of the Cold War themed films. By all means not the best Cold War thriller or the best submarine film, but easily of the better and more entertaining ones. If you like the cast and the idea of Sean Connery failing in Russian, this is a must see.

    After the pent up, singular set shenanigans of Die Hard comes the grandeur, submarines and warships set, more narratively driven espionage thriller of The Hunt for Red October; John McTiernan's follow up to an action film masterpiece which, itself, is a bit of an action film masterpiece anyway. The film is a nourishing piece; carrying with it a genuine sense of there being craft at hand, a two hour plus piece which rattles along because it's depicting characters and doing well with its premise. Here is the English language thriller that depicts secret agents; nuclear submarines and a general sense of chase, but is happens to be gripping and smart. Where did the process of forcing us to sit stuck in a film's icy grip of ill thought filmmaking, as poorly put together set pieces are spoon fed to us, suddenly vanish to? Aside from the obvious Soviet connotations, the film's immediate opening calls to mind Sergei Eisenstein's montage editing experiment of the 1920s, when three separate objects were inter-cut with a lone man's reaction: To which item was he reacting? Was it all three? How was he reacting to each item? How do we interpret his reaction? When we observe Sean Connery's Russian naval captain Marko Ramius stand aboard his submarine, shortly before it delves below into the depths of the icy ocean and away, we are allowed entry into his 'looking' out at the snowy tips that make up the tail end of whatever stretches of land this is that still constitutes as the Soviet Union. Through a similar method to Eisenstein, McTiernan allows us this "person/item/reaction" structure in his editing of the opening scene. The film's IMDb pitch reads: "the USSR's best submarine captain in their newest sub violates orders and heads for the USA. Is he trying to defect, or to start a war?" - if you know you're cinema, and with all this in mind, you might be able to work out the truth behind such a premise from this cine-literate process of montage construction, something that's revealed ninety minutes later anyway. That's not to degrade the film for being predictable; on the contrary, the film is a remarkably well constructed drama which toys with this premise and sews in a lot of other material wonderfully well. With this rouge Russian submarine loose, the Americans call in the man they have employed in the C.I.A. so as to aid them in their action against it. This man is Jack Ryan, here played by Alec Baldwin; an agent working with a government organisation and a man whose smooth named invokes the likes of "James Bond"; a man whose existence extends to the knowing of the precise dynamics that makes up turbulence before he flirts with a stewardess who's working on board the plane he's using to fly to The States from his home in London. This is, of course, after he's already been driven to the airport in a fancy looking car amidst all the nondescript taxis inferring pre-eminence. Meanwhile, on board Ramius' vessel, the man speaks of doom-laden bible passages and we observe through the props littering his quarters an apparent fondness for a kind of warfare via the literature and certain paintings on show. The unrest extends to the fact one of his crew does well to infiltrate the man's domain before appearing to be killed with Ramius' own bare hands. How the Soviets themselves react is through distributing a second submarine to go after Ramius, with a scattershot Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd character in charge, and whose intentions are to bring Ramius down. The film will spill out into a suspicion and distrust laden piece wherein the dynamic will read something along the lines of the Soviets, who're on the ground, are too stunned by what the Soviets underwater are doing who themselves are confusing the Americans in their submarine underwater who're themselves frightening the Americans on the ground with their actions. This is cut adrift of the gunfire and shooting of Die Hard, ingredients of which indeed make up most English language American action thrillers. But here is a film which, much later on, has a character reveal a gun. Its presence is actually quite startling, if only for the fact we'd completely forgotten about the very existence of such things, and now that one has been introduced into the fray, we're so much more aware of what damage it might induce than we have most probably of any firearm in any proceedings film of The Hunt for Red October's ilk. Such a statement will sound derogatory toward Die Hard. Rest assured, how that film was made was precisely how one should go about making such a film, but this is McTiernan proving he can operate at either ends of the scale. This is one of those all-star cast American 'event' films that happen to be really good instead of empty; overly long and fragmented by this insistence to provide its audience with episodic stunts that disguise its inability to provide a congealed experience of storytelling and depiction of character. The "action" consists of suited men in rooms arguing with one another; the "drama" the ambiguity surrounding a central character's actions.

    Am I alone in thinking Tom Clancy is overrated ? I did once have the misfortune of reading PATRIOT GAMES , you know the thriller where a bunch of Irish terrorists try to kill Jack Ryan because he foiled their plot to kidnap Charles and Diana , you know the thriller where Clancy bludgeons the reader over the head that these Irish terrorists aren't the ones belonging to the IRA but are an entirely different breed of ultra nasty baddies . Compared to the book the unconvincing film version of PATROIT GAMES is almost a fly on the wall documentary on the Irish troubles so after reading the book I didn't bother wasting any more of my life reading his novels . I do recall seeing a TV interview with the author where he claimed he spent six months researching the material for his novels then spent six months writing them . I guess he must be a very slow reader and typist in that case Many of the people on this page who have a Luke warm reaction to the source novel have unreservedly praised this cinematic adaptation and you can understand this . The story for what its worth is riddled with plot inconsistencies . Stop to consider why the Americans think Red October is planning a pre-emptive strike simply because it's sailing close to the United States since the whole point of these ICBM subs is to be able to target a target from anywhere in the world . Simply sailing close to the United States doesn't indicate anything . Likewise if the propulsion system is so effective how do the Americans have no problem detecting the sub while the Soviets can't ? Oh and if Captain Marko Ramius wanted to defect wouldn't he have found an easier way than steal a submarine ? You see if you stop to examine things everything falls apart very quickly . But there's two things that stop this . One is the fine cast. Sean Connery is one of these actors who has always had a very strong physical presence but continually appeared in material that had him miscast . This isn't the case here and it's impossible to think of anyone who would have been anywhere a good substitute as Ramius and he's ably supported by an excellent international cast . Even Tim Curry is convincing in his small role The second saving grace is the impressive cinematography by Jan de Bont . One irritating aspect of film making in the 21st Century is the number of films that all have the same look regardless of who the director of photography is , British in particular suffer from this and it's become a lost art these days with rare notable exceptions such as Roger Deakins . This film sees a cinematographer on top of his game where lighting and colour scheme is concerned

    This movie is based on a Tom Clancy novel of the same name. It is about a Russian Submarine captain, Rameus, who wishes to defect to the United States because his faith in the system has vanished. The themes in this movie revolve around the arms race, a first strike war policy, and immoral policy decisions. The Russians have created a submarine with a silent drive. As such, it can sneak up on the American shore and launch missiles at them without being detected. It is very much a first strike weapon and Rameus does not like this because policy makers in the Kremlin have created it simply to start a war. This is the whole idea of the policy decisions. Rameus respects his motherland, but has come to the conclusion that such a weapon is designed to start a war, not end it and as such he does not want a part of it. In the end he decides that he has had enough and leaves. It is ironic that even though this sub has a silent engine, one American submarine is able to track it. It knows what its signature sounds like and this seems to defeat the entire purpose of this silent engine. The thing that irked me about this movie is that the Russians are the bad guys and the Americans are the good guys. This was set during the Cold War and as such patriotism was required. The thing is that the politician in this movie is a liar and a cheat - a real slime bag, yet he comes out on top and the Russians are portrayed as being the idiots. The Americans land up with this first strike weapon and the Russians lose out big time. This is not surprising because the author is American and he is writing at a time when the Russians were bad and Americans were good. Yet this was written during the time I was a teenager and as such we loved the Russians because they were the bad guys and our parents (mine especially) would constantly rave about how bad they were. In the end I sympathise with the Russians because I do not see them as the evil empire, but rather the other side in a war in which can only be one winner. History is written by the victors and the victors are always seen as being the good guys, even though they probably are not. This is clear when we see the slimy politician in this movie. He is slime yet he is on the side of the winners - though I would hardly call him a good guy. Anyway, I still quite like this movie, and was disappointed with the sequels as they removed Alec Baldwin and replaced him with Harrison Ford. I hate it when they do that.

    The Hunt for Red October is a thriller based on the novel of the same name by Tom Clancy. It was directed by John McTiernan and stars Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin.This was the first of several films based on Tom Clancy's thrillers that presents eccentric CIA analyst Jack Ryan. The year was 1984. Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius sets the plot in motion when he murders his political adviser, burns his orders, and steers his submarine,Red October towards American waters, hoping to defect. The CIA, aware that the Red October was about to embark on an evasive mission to demonstrate its ability to avoid detection and fire its nuclear missiles upon U.S. installations, believes that Ramius is insane, and that he plans to start World War III. To cover their own behinds, the Russians back up the CIA's suspicion. Only Jack Ryan believes that Ramius' mission is not as apocalyptic as it seems -- and it is Ryan who is assigned to infiltrate the Red October to prove his theory. The first Jack Ryan thriller film is a supremely mounted film and well acted by Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery as Jack Ryan and Marko Ramius respectively.It was vastly enjoyable and entertaining that one will not regret watching it and spending many hours discussing about it after viewing the film.And most of all,it was a great adaptation of Tom Clancy's novel.

    Tom Clancy was almost a sleeper hit, in the novel world, anyways, back in the 1980's, and this first film in the Jack Ryan movie adaptations, is a true wonder. Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Sam Niell, James Earl Jones, and more big stars fill the screen in good, sometimes great performances that just enhance the experience. The film shines in the way that it explores submarines, not just the insides in a way like a documentary, but the mood of the sub, the way you could at almost anytime fire a missile and eliminate a city, the duty a seaman has and the pressure he is under with millions and billions of dollars of taxpayers money, and it is almost a haunting film at times, aided by Basil Poledouris' brilliant score. As for the Jack Ryan character, Alec Baldwin, I must admit, gives a realist performance as an up and excited guy who is an analyst on his first field job, sort of, that is. A great film also in its story, and a pace that is seemingly slow at times, but it works nonetheless.

    "The Hunt For Red October" is a 1990 film directed by John McTiernan and stars Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery. The film is adapted from the 1984 Tom Clancy novel about a Soviet nuclear submarine which drops off U.S. scanners, prompting a young CIA analyst (Baldwin) to scramble to find out what the captain's (Connery) motives really are. To start off, I love Tom Clancy. I'm a fairly big fan of his Splinter Cell, Rainbow SIx, and Ghost Recon franchises. I had also heard of "Red October" and that it was directed by the guy who made "Predator" and "Die Hard", so I was already pretty excited to watch this movie. In short, the film did not, in any way, disappoint. What kind of shocked and worried me about this is that this film was filed under the "Thriller" section on Netflix. . .and it's rated PG. Needless to say, this fact sort of worried me. I was wrong though - just because this movie is PG does not mean it isn't "thrilling" in any sense of the word. "Red October" is in fact an "edge of your seat" thriller by definition. Almost every facet of this film is excellent. The script, I found, was very witty and well written by Larry Ferguson. The acting was spectacular, specifically of course from Connery and Baldwin. The score was very awesome and appropriate for the source material. The special effects were very good, especially for the late 80's. I'd say that "The Hunt For Red October" is a solid thriller that will have a hard time disappointing many of its viewers.

    After two seminal action films, director John McTiernan shifts towards political suspense thriller territory with very impressive results. The strength of this thriller is the a lot of the story and drama plays out through close ups and characters in confined spaces, and John McTiernan exploits this fully. The plot, adapted from the Tom Clancy novel, is sophisticated and involving, and congratulations go to screenwriters Larry Ferguson, Donald Stewart and John Milius(who did some un-credited work) for crafting a clever, suspenseful, well informed screenplay, peppered with moments of dry humour. Acting performances are fairly broad, and it is no surprise that despite a Scottish accent, Sean Connery's sheer charisma leads to yet another commanding performance that anchors the film. He is ably supported by the cast that plays his submarine crew, albeit for me Sam Neill seemed an unusual choice and didn't quite work. While in small role, Peter Firth is ideal in the political officer role, and Tim Curry is rather amusing as the slightly na&iuml;ve and sycophantic doctor. Alec Baldwin is surprisingly refreshing as the slightly out his depth analyst thrown into the front line, but his character rises to the challenge and becomes the reluctant hero in the end. He receives outstanding support from James Earl Jones, Scott Glenn, Courtney Vance, Anthony Peck, Richard Jordan and Joss Ackland. In fact all these performances are grounded and charismatic, albeit Richard Jordan's and Joss Ackland's diplomatic exchanges are the main vehicle for the film's humour, which plays out very cleverly in what is actually plot exposition for the audience. The production is also expertly crafted by director John McTiernan. He makes full use of Jan de Bont's first rate photography (they had collaborated on Die Hard), and together with production designer Terence Marsh and co-operation from the US Navy, leads to some great in camera set pieces. This is fully realised by Basil Poledouris's excellent score, which creates a truly terrific atmosphere, and the Oscar winning sound effects, that also help bring the audience into the film's settings. Sound editor Cecelia Hall was already a very experienced sound effects editor, having worked on a variety of films including Star Treks 2 and 3, Airplane II, Staying Alive, Beverly Hills Cops 1 & 2,Terms of Endearment, Top Gun, The Golden Child and Action Jackson. After her success on Red October, she would on other high profile films such as Days of Thunder, The Adams Family Movies and Patriot Games. She went on to be Senior Vice-President of Post Production Sound at Paramount, and works as a Professor at UCLA. George Walters II is one of Hollywood's most successful sound editors. After starting work in Hollywood in the seventies, his CV prior to Red October included work on the first three Star Trek movies, Staying Alive, Flash-dance, Beverly Hills Cop 1 & 2, Critical Condition, Crocodile Dundee 2, Naked Gun. After Red October, he continues to rack up first rate work on yet more films including Naked Gun 2.5, Patriot Games, Star Trek VI, The War, Crimson Tide, Broken Arrow, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon, Thomas Crown Affair, Pirates of the Caribbean 1 & 2, Enemy of the State including winning a second Oscar for best sound on Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour. Unfortunately the one failing in the film, despite all the excellent other technical contributions is the visual effects. While not terrible they are clearly not at the level of the rest of the film. Disagreements between director McTiernan and original visual supervisor Richard Edlund, heading up the BOSS fx house, led to the company being removed from the project late in post-production, and George Lucas's ILM having to come in to do a rush job to get something in place for the films March 1990 release. They had to make do with the models that had been built when BOSS was running the visual effects; using a smoked studio with the miniatures hanging from wires, and some subtle digital effects to help sell the illusion of being underwater. They managed to do a reasonable if unremarkable job (albeit the films budget did mushroom). For example the visual fx do not come close to the outstanding work that was done on James Cameron's The Abyss, whose underwater visual fx was so much better, even though that film came out nearly a year earlier(and had its own production problems). Tony Scott's Crimson Tide, that came five years later showed what underwater submarine visual fx should look like. However the film-makers do mitigate the poor quality through editing the shots in quick cuts which means they don't have the opportunity to pull you out of the story. Another clever albeit cynical approach is to blur the footage. This helps sell "underwater", but sometimes makes it difficult to see what is going on, and is a way of potentially hiding imperfections in the actual shot. Nevertheless, despite this the fact the rest of the film was so good allows the audience to still get a great deal of enjoyment out of an expertly crafted political thriller.

    I'll admit it. I don't like war movies. But "Hunt for Red October" is not a war movie, its a story about an era in human history: a story about comradery, friends, enemies, sober pausing at the edge of human destruction, the bomb :-) I watched this movie again and was struck by its power (again!). Its all-male casting makes it a true depiction of a men's world, except here the men are not lone wolves like Rambo, but rather family men trying to avoid the third world war, playing a clever game of cat and mouse with the enemy who is not always the stereotypical savage. When I first saw this as a 15 yo, I couldn't get over the awesome music: I watched the beginning credits on Sony Beta tape over and over again... I still listen to the soundtrack occasionally. If you haven't seen this, you must. You will fall in love with the intricate characters like the sonar operators, sub drivers, etc. The character performances and especially the dialog between soviet officers is absolutely brilliant. This movie is definitely way up there on my top 10 all time movies list.

    Easily the best film ever about a Russian sub captain with a Scottish accent. Actually he's of Lithuanian ancestry, but still... The first movie adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel, an adaptation of his very first one, this is also the first to feature his regular protagonist, Jack Ryan, played here by Alec Baldwin, who plays him quite well as the out-of-his-depth intelligence analyst. It is Sean Connery who dominates the film however as Red October's captain, Marko Ramius. Despite the accent, he is on excellent form throughout. The supporting cast are no slackers either - Sam Neill as Borodin, James Earl Jones as Ryan's mentor Admiral Greer, Scott Glenn as Bart Mancuso, Courtney B Vance as Jones. Underwater scenes often provide pacing problems, and while the models used never actually saw any water, there are a few moments when the pace threatens to sag. Fortunately, it never does, with some hair-raising moments such as the Dallas stalking Red October without the latter even aware they're there, and the climactic battle with the Alfa-class V K Konovolov. There are many other great scenes too such as Ryan's set-to with a saboteur, and the Red October's evasion of a torpedo launched from a 'Bear-Foxtrot'. Basil Poledouris' score is fantastic, lending the film an epic feel, while also ominous in more tense scenes. The film is not without flaws. Some of the effects weren't convincing even in 1990. There are moments when the Red October looks every bit a model, an external shot of a 'Bear-Foxtrot' never looks anything less than one. It would appear a bit of corner-cutting went on with the budget. Witness an F-14 about to crash suddenly turn into vintage footage of an old 50s Grumman F9F. The same shot of a torpedo being dropped from into sea is used twice, once for the Bear, and another for an SH-60 Seahawk. While far more believable than most spy thrillers, a few changes take away from the realism that the book's author is often praised for. The manner in which Jack concludes what Ramius is up to for instance seems awfully contrived - the evidence he bases his conclusion on in the book was actually more simple and perfectly reasonable. Caveats aside, this remains a high point in Cold War cinema, coming out just as that era was effectively over.

The Hunt for Red October is a quality early 90's thriller that will satisfy any fans of the Cold War themed films. By all means not the best Cold War thriller or the best submarine film, but easily of the better and more entertaining ones. If you like the cast and the idea of Sean Connery failing in Russian, this is a must see.

Is he trying to defect, or to start a war?" - if you know you're cinema, and with all this in mind, you might be able to work out the truth behind such a premise from this cine-literate process of montage construction, something that's revealed ninety minutes later anyway. That's not to degrade the film for being predictable; on the contrary, the film is a remarkably well constructed drama which toys with this premise and sews in a lot of other material wonderfully well. With this rouge Russian submarine loose, the Americans call in the man they have employed in the C.I.A. so as to aid them in their action against it. This man is Jack Ryan, here played by Alec Baldwin; an agent working with a government organisation and a man whose smooth named invokes the likes of "James Bond"; a man whose existence extends to the knowing of the precise dynamics that makes up turbulence before he flirts with a stewardess who's working on board the plane he's using to fly to The States from his home in London. This is, of course, after he's already been driven to the airport in a fancy looking car amidst all the nondescript taxis inferring pre-eminence. Meanwhile, on board Ramius' vessel, the man speaks of doom-laden bible passages and we observe through the props littering his quarters an apparent fondness for a kind of warfare via the literature and certain paintings on show. The unrest extends to the fact one of his crew does well to infiltrate the man's domain before appearing to be killed with Ramius' own bare hands. How the Soviets themselves react is through distributing a second submarine to go after Ramius, with a scattershot Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd character in charge, and whose intentions are to bring Ramius down. The film will spill out into a suspicion and distrust laden piece wherein the dynamic will read something along the lines of the Soviets, who're on the ground, are too stunned by what the Soviets underwater are doing who themselves are confusing the Americans in their submarine underwater who're themselves frightening the Americans on the ground with their actions. This is cut adrift of the gunfire and shooting of Die Hard, ingredients of which indeed make up most English language American action thrillers. But here is a film which, much later on, has a character reveal a gun. Its presence is actually quite startling, if only for the fact we'd completely forgotten about the very existence of such things, and now that one has been introduced into the fray, we're so much more aware of what damage it might induce than we have most probably of any firearm in any proceedings film of The Hunt for Red October's ilk. Such a statement will sound derogatory toward Die Hard. Rest assured, how that film was made was precisely how one should go about making such a film, but this is McTiernan proving he can operate at either ends of the scale. This is one of those all-star cast American 'event' films that happen to be really good instead of empty; overly long and fragmented by this insistence to provide its audience with episodic stunts that disguise its inability to provide a congealed experience of storytelling and depiction of character. The "action" consists of suited men in rooms arguing with one another; the "drama" the ambiguity surrounding a central character's actions.

    Am I alone in thinking Tom Clancy is overrated ? I did once have the misfortune of reading PATRIOT GAMES , you know the thriller where a bunch of Irish terrorists try to kill Jack Ryan because he foiled their plot to kidnap Charles and Diana , you know the thriller where Clancy bludgeons the reader over the head that these Irish terrorists aren't the ones belonging to the IRA but are an entirely different breed of ultra nasty baddies . Compared to the book the unconvincing film version of PATROIT GAMES is almost a fly on the wall documentary on the Irish troubles so after reading the book I didn't bother wasting any more of my life reading his novels . I do recall seeing a TV interview with the author where he claimed he spent six months researching the material for his novels then spent six months writing them . I guess he must be a very slow reader and typist in that case Many of the people on this page who have a Luke warm reaction to the source novel have unreservedly praised this cinematic adaptation and you can understand this . The story for what its worth is riddled with plot inconsistencies . Stop to consider why the Americans think Red October is planning a pre-emptive strike simply because it's sailing close to the United States since the whole point of these ICBM subs is to be able to target a target from anywhere in the world . Simply sailing close to the United States doesn't indicate anything . Likewise if the propulsion system is so effective how do the Americans have no problem detecting the sub while the Soviets can't ? Oh and if Captain Marko Ramius wanted to defect wouldn't he have found an easier way than steal a submarine ? You see if you stop to examine things everything falls apart very quickly . But there's two things that stop this . One is the fine cast. Sean Connery is one of these actors who has always had a very strong physical presence but continually appeared in material that had him miscast . This isn't the case here and it's impossible to think of anyone who would have been anywhere a good substitute as Ramius and he's ably supported by an excellent international cast . Even Tim Curry is convincing in his small role The second saving grace is the impressive cinematography by Jan de Bont . One irritating aspect of film making in the 21st Century is the number of films that all have the same look regardless of who the director of photography is , British in particular suffer from this and it's become a lost art these days with rare notable exceptions such as Roger Deakins . This film sees a cinematographer on top of his game where lighting and colour scheme is concerned

    This movie is based on a Tom Clancy novel of the same name. It is about a Russian Submarine captain, Rameus, who wishes to defect to the United States because his faith in the system has vanished. The themes in this movie revolve around the arms race, a first strike war policy, and immoral policy decisions. The Russians have created a submarine with a silent drive. As such, it can sneak up on the American shore and launch missiles at them without being detected. It is very much a first strike weapon and Rameus does not like this because policy makers in the Kremlin have created it simply to start a war. This is the whole idea of the policy decisions. Rameus respects his motherland, but has come to the conclusion that such a weapon is designed to start a war, not end it and as such he does not want a part of it. In the end he decides that he has had enough and leaves. It is ironic that even though this sub has a silent engine, one American submarine is able to track it. It knows what its signature sounds like and this seems to defeat the entire purpose of this silent engine. The thing that irked me about this movie is that the Russians are the bad guys and the Americans are the good guys. This was set during the Cold War and as such patriotism was required. The thing is that the politician in this movie is a liar and a cheat - a real slime bag, yet he comes out on top and the Russians are portrayed as being the idiots. The Americans land up with this first strike weapon and the Russians lose out big time. This is not surprising because the author is American and he is writing at a time when the Russians were bad and Americans were good. Yet this was written during the time I was a teenager and as such we loved the Russians because they were the bad guys and our parents (mine especially) would constantly rave about how bad they were. In the end I sympathise with the Russians because I do not see them as the evil empire, but rather the other side in a war in which can only be one winner. History is written by the victors and the victors are always seen as being the good guys, even though they probably are not. This is clear when we see the slimy politician in this movie. He is slime yet he is on the side of the winners - though I would hardly call him a good guy. Anyway, I still quite like this movie, and was disappointed with the sequels as they removed Alec Baldwin and replaced him with Harrison Ford. I hate it when they do that.

    The Hunt for Red October is a thriller based on the novel of the same name by Tom Clancy. It was directed by John McTiernan and stars Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin.This was the first of several films based on Tom Clancy's thrillers that presents eccentric CIA analyst Jack Ryan. The year was 1984. Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius sets the plot in motion when he murders his political adviser, burns his orders, and steers his submarine,Red October towards American waters, hoping to defect. The CIA, aware that the Red October was about to embark on an evasive mission to demonstrate its ability to avoid detection and fire its nuclear missiles upon U.S. installations, believes that Ramius is insane, and that he plans to start World War III. To cover their own behinds, the Russians back up the CIA's suspicion. Only Jack Ryan believes that Ramius' mission is not as apocalyptic as it seems -- and it is Ryan who is assigned to infiltrate the Red October to prove his theory. The first Jack Ryan thriller film is a supremely mounted film and well acted by Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery as Jack Ryan and Marko Ramius respectively.It was vastly enjoyable and entertaining that one will not regret watching it and spending many hours discussing about it after viewing the film.And most of all,it was a great adaptation of Tom Clancy's novel.

    Tom Clancy was almost a sleeper hit, in the novel world, anyways, back in the 1980's, and this first film in the Jack Ryan movie adaptations, is a true wonder. Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Sam Niell, James Earl Jones, and more big stars fill the screen in good, sometimes great performances that just enhance the experience. The film shines in the way that it explores submarines, not just the insides in a way like a documentary, but the mood of the sub, the way you could at almost anytime fire a missile and eliminate a city, the duty a seaman has and the pressure he is under with millions and billions of dollars of taxpayers money, and it is almost a haunting film at times, aided by Basil Poledouris' brilliant score. As for the Jack Ryan character, Alec Baldwin, I must admit, gives a realist performance as an up and excited guy who is an analyst on his first field job, sort of, that is. A great film also in its story, and a pace that is seemingly slow at times, but it works nonetheless.

    "The Hunt For Red October" is a 1990 film directed by John McTiernan and stars Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery. The film is adapted from the 1984 Tom Clancy novel about a Soviet nuclear submarine which drops off U.S. scanners, prompting a young CIA analyst (Baldwin) to scramble to find out what the captain's (Connery) motives really are. To start off, I love Tom Clancy. I'm a fairly big fan of his Splinter Cell, Rainbow SIx, and Ghost Recon franchises. I had also heard of "Red October" and that it was directed by the guy who made "Predator" and "Die Hard", so I was already pretty excited to watch this movie. In short, the film did not, in any way, disappoint. What kind of shocked and worried me about this is that this film was filed under the "Thriller" section on Netflix. . .and it's rated PG. Needless to say, this fact sort of worried me. I was wrong though - just because this movie is PG does not mean it isn't "thrilling" in any sense of the word. "Red October" is in fact an "edge of your seat" thriller by definition. Almost every facet of this film is excellent. The script, I found, was very witty and well written by Larry Ferguson. The acting was spectacular, specifically of course from Connery and Baldwin. The score was very awesome and appropriate for the source material. The special effects were very good, especially for the late 80's. I'd say that "The Hunt For Red October" is a solid thriller that will have a hard time disappointing many of its viewers.

    After two seminal action films, director John McTiernan shifts towards political suspense thriller territory with very impressive results. The strength of this thriller is the a lot of the story and drama plays out through close ups and characters in confined spaces, and John McTiernan exploits this fully. The plot, adapted from the Tom Clancy novel, is sophisticated and involving, and congratulations go to screenwriters Larry Ferguson, Donald Stewart and John Milius(who did some un-credited work) for crafting a clever, suspenseful, well informed screenplay, peppered with moments of dry humour. Acting performances are fairly broad, and it is no surprise that despite a Scottish accent, Sean Connery's sheer charisma leads to yet another commanding performance that anchors the film. He is ably supported by the cast that plays his submarine crew, albeit for me Sam Neill seemed an unusual choice and didn't quite work. While in small role, Peter Firth is ideal in the political officer role, and Tim Curry is rather amusing as the slightly na&iuml;ve and sycophantic doctor. Alec Baldwin is surprisingly refreshing as the slightly out his depth analyst thrown into the front line, but his character rises to the challenge and becomes the reluctant hero in the end. He receives outstanding support from James Earl Jones, Scott Glenn, Courtney Vance, Anthony Peck, Richard Jordan and Joss Ackland. In fact all these performances are grounded and charismatic, albeit Richard Jordan's and Joss Ackland's diplomatic exchanges are the main vehicle for the film's humour, which plays out very cleverly in what is actually plot exposition for the audience. The production is also expertly crafted by director John McTiernan. He makes full use of Jan de Bont's first rate photography (they had collaborated on Die Hard), and together with production designer Terence Marsh and co-operation from the US Navy, leads to some great in camera set pieces. This is fully realised by Basil Poledouris's excellent score, which creates a truly terrific atmosphere, and the Oscar winning sound effects, that also help bring the audience into the film's settings. Sound editor Cecelia Hall was already a very experienced sound effects editor, having worked on a variety of films including Star Treks 2 and 3, Airplane II, Staying Alive, Beverly Hills Cops 1 & 2,Terms of Endearment, Top Gun, The Golden Child and Action Jackson. After her success on Red October, she would on other high profile films such as Days of Thunder, The Adams Family Movies and Patriot Games. She went on to be Senior Vice-President of Post Production Sound at Paramount, and works as a Professor at UCLA. George Walters II is one of Hollywood's most successful sound editors. After starting work in Hollywood in the seventies, his CV prior to Red October included work on the first three Star Trek movies, Staying Alive, Flash-dance, Beverly Hills Cop 1 & 2, Critical Condition, Crocodile Dundee 2, Naked Gun. After Red October, he continues to rack up first rate work on yet more films including Naked Gun 2.5, Patriot Games, Star Trek VI, The War, Crimson Tide, Broken Arrow, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon, Thomas Crown Affair, Pirates of the Caribbean 1 & 2, Enemy of the State including winning a second Oscar for best sound on Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour. Unfortunately the one failing in the film, despite all the excellent other technical contributions is the visual effects. While not terrible they are clearly not at the level of the rest of the film. Disagreements between director McTiernan and original visual supervisor Richard Edlund, heading up the BOSS fx house, led to the company being removed from the project late in post-production, and George Lucas's ILM having to come in to do a rush job to get something in place for the films March 1990 release. They had to make do with the models that had been built when BOSS was running the visual effects; using a smoked studio with the miniatures hanging from wires, and some subtle digital effects to help sell the illusion of being underwater. They managed to do a reasonable if unremarkable job (albeit the films budget did mushroom). For example the visual fx do not come close to the outstanding work that was done on James Cameron's The Abyss, whose underwater visual fx was so much better, even though that film came out nearly a year earlier(and had its own production problems). Tony Scott's Crimson Tide, that came five years later showed what underwater submarine visual fx should look like. However the film-makers do mitigate the poor quality through editing the shots in quick cuts which means they don't have the opportunity to pull you out of the story. Another clever albeit cynical approach is to blur the footage. This helps sell "underwater", but sometimes makes it difficult to see what is going on, and is a way of potentially hiding imperfections in the actual shot. Nevertheless, despite this the fact the rest of the film was so good allows the audience to still get a great deal of enjoyment out of an expertly crafted political thriller.

    I'll admit it. I don't like war movies. But "Hunt for Red October" is not a war movie, its a story about an era in human history: a story about comradery, friends, enemies, sober pausing at the edge of human destruction, the bomb :-) I watched this movie again and was struck by its power (again!). Its all-male casting makes it a true depiction of a men's world, except here the men are not lone wolves like Rambo, but rather family men trying to avoid the third world war, playing a clever game of cat and mouse with the enemy who is not always the stereotypical savage. When I first saw this as a 15 yo, I couldn't get over the awesome music: I watched the beginning credits on Sony Beta tape over and over again... I still listen to the soundtrack occasionally. If you haven't seen this, you must. You will fall in love with the intricate characters like the sonar operators, sub drivers, etc. The character performances and especially the dialog between soviet officers is absolutely brilliant. This movie is definitely way up there on my top 10 all time movies list.

    Easily the best film ever about a Russian sub captain with a Scottish accent. Actually he's of Lithuanian ancestry, but still... The first movie adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel, an adaptation of his very first one, this is also the first to feature his regular protagonist, Jack Ryan, played here by Alec Baldwin, who plays him quite well as the out-of-his-depth intelligence analyst. It is Sean Connery who dominates the film however as Red October's captain, Marko Ramius. Despite the accent, he is on excellent form throughout. The supporting cast are no slackers either - Sam Neill as Borodin, James Earl Jones as Ryan's mentor Admiral Greer, Scott Glenn as Bart Mancuso, Courtney B Vance as Jones. Underwater scenes often provide pacing problems, and while the models used never actually saw any water, there are a few moments when the pace threatens to sag. Fortunately, it never does, with some hair-raising moments such as the Dallas stalking Red October without the latter even aware they're there, and the climactic battle with the Alfa-class V K Konovolov. There are many other great scenes too such as Ryan's set-to with a saboteur, and the Red October's evasion of a torpedo launched from a 'Bear-Foxtrot'. Basil Poledouris' score is fantastic, lending the film an epic feel, while also ominous in more tense scenes. The film is not without flaws. Some of the effects weren't convincing even in 1990. There are moments when the Red October looks every bit a model, an external shot of a 'Bear-Foxtrot' never looks anything less than one. It would appear a bit of corner-cutting went on with the budget. Witness an F-14 about to crash suddenly turn into vintage footage of an old 50s Grumman F9F. The same shot of a torpedo being dropped from into sea is used twice, once for the Bear, and another for an SH-60 Seahawk. While far more believable than most spy thrillers, a few changes take away from the realism that the book's author is often praised for. The manner in which Jack concludes what Ramius is up to for instance seems awfully contrived - the evidence he bases his conclusion on in the book was actually more simple and perfectly reasonable. Caveats aside, this remains a high point in Cold War cinema, coming out just as that era was effectively over.

    The Hunt For Red October is a quality thriller from one the better action directors of late 80's and early 90's John McTiernan. It features an excellent ensemble cast, convoluted Cold War plot and Sean Connery at his very Connery best. While at times it feels dated and has some annoying clich&eacute;s here and there, it's very entertaining as hell. The strongest element aside from the excellent direction, is the cast. We have Sean Connery, Sam Neill, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Tim Curry, James Earl Jones, Stellan Skarsgard and Jeffrey Jones to name a few. The acting is top notch all around with the highlights being Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin. The only thing that bothered me a lot was the terrible line deliveries in Russian. For a person who has an excellent ear for languages, it felt so out of place and borderline hilarious. But when they start all speaking English it's fine but the first 10 or so minutes are very awkward to watch. From the technical side of things, The Hunt for Red October is great. Lots of practical effects and real locations used for great effect. If they spared the terrible early 90's CGI, it would have felt more timeless and less dated. Just like Das Boot, John McTiernan knows how to create tension and suspense without showing much. It's not as good as Das Boot but still does a fine job. The skillful direction elevates the painfully mediocre and convoluted script considerably. Plot and characters are were The Hunt for Red October falls short. The plot is beyond convoluted and there are many moments you keep scratching your head in confusion. Also some of the characters like the rock star sonar technician were too silly and just felt out place. All the problems are very minor and these small details doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. The Hunt for Red October is a quality early 90's thriller that will satisfy any fans of the Cold War themed films. By all means not the best Cold War thriller or the best submarine film, but easily of the better and more entertaining ones. If you like the cast and the idea of Sean Connery failing in Russian, this is a must see.

    After the pent up, singular set shenanigans of Die Hard comes the grandeur, submarines and warships set, more narratively driven espionage thriller of The Hunt for Red October; John McTiernan's follow up to an action film masterpiece which, itself, is a bit of an action film masterpiece anyway. The film is a nourishing piece; carrying with it a genuine sense of there being craft at hand, a two hour plus piece which rattles along because it's depicting characters and doing well with its premise. Here is the English language thriller that depicts secret agents; nuclear submarines and a general sense of chase, but is happens to be gripping and smart. Where did the process of forcing us to sit stuck in a film's icy grip of ill thought filmmaking, as poorly put together set pieces are spoon fed to us, suddenly vanish to? Aside from the obvious Soviet connotations, the film's immediate opening calls to mind Sergei Eisenstein's montage editing experiment of the 1920s, when three separate objects were inter-cut with a lone man's reaction: To which item was he reacting? Was it all three? How was he reacting to each item? How do we interpret his reaction? When we observe Sean Connery's Russian naval captain Marko Ramius stand aboard his submarine, shortly before it delves below into the depths of the icy ocean and away, we are allowed entry into his 'looking' out at the snowy tips that make up the tail end of whatever stretches of land this is that still constitutes as the Soviet Union. Through a similar method to Eisenstein, McTiernan allows us this "person/item/reaction" structure in his editing of the opening scene. The film's IMDb pitch reads: "the USSR's best submarine captain in their newest sub violates orders and heads for the USA. Is he trying to defect, or to start a war?" - if you know you're cinema, and with all this in mind, you might be able to work out the truth behind such a premise from this cine-literate process of montage construction, something that's revealed ninety minutes later anyway. That's not to degrade the film for being predictable; on the contrary, the film is a remarkably well constructed drama which toys with this premise and sews in a lot of other material wonderfully well. With this rouge Russian submarine loose, the Americans call in the man they have employed in the C.I.A. so as to aid them in their action against it. This man is Jack Ryan, here played by Alec Baldwin; an agent working with a government organisation and a man whose smooth named invokes the likes of "James Bond"; a man whose existence extends to the knowing of the precise dynamics that makes up turbulence before he flirts with a stewardess who's working on board the plane he's using to fly to The States from his home in London. This is, of course, after he's already been driven to the airport in a fancy looking car amidst all the nondescript taxis inferring pre-eminence. Meanwhile, on board Ramius' vessel, the man speaks of doom-laden bible passages and we observe through the props littering his quarters an apparent fondness for a kind of warfare via the literature and certain paintings on show. The unrest extends to the fact one of his crew does well to infiltrate the man's domain before appearing to be killed with Ramius' own bare hands. How the Soviets themselves react is through distributing a second submarine to go after Ramius, with a scattershot Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd character in charge, and whose intentions are to bring Ramius down. The film will spill out into a suspicion and distrust laden piece wherein the dynamic will read something along the lines of the Soviets, who're on the ground, are too stunned by what the Soviets underwater are doing who themselves are confusing the Americans in their submarine underwater who're themselves frightening the Americans on the ground with their actions. This is cut adrift of the gunfire and shooting of Die Hard, ingredients of which indeed make up most English language American action thrillers. But here is a film which, much later on, has a character reveal a gun. Its presence is actually quite startling, if only for the fact we'd completely forgotten about the very existence of such things, and now that one has been introduced into the fray, we're so much more aware of what damage it might induce than we have most probably of any firearm in any proceedings film of The Hunt for Red October's ilk. Such a statement will sound derogatory toward Die Hard. Rest assured, how that film was made was precisely how one should go about making such a film, but this is McTiernan proving he can operate at either ends of the scale. This is one of those all-star cast American 'event' films that happen to be really good instead of empty; overly long and fragmented by this insistence to provide its audience with episodic stunts that disguise its inability to provide a congealed experience of storytelling and depiction of character. The "action" consists of suited men in rooms arguing with one another; the "drama" the ambiguity surrounding a central character's actions.

    This movie is based on a Tom Clancy novel of the same name. It is about a Russian Submarine captain, Rameus, who wishes to defect to the United States because his faith in the system has vanished. The themes in this movie revolve around the arms race, a first strike war policy, and immoral policy decisions. The Russians have created a submarine with a silent drive. As such, it can sneak up on the American shore and launch missiles at them without being detected. It is very much a first strike weapon and Rameus does not like this because policy makers in the Kremlin have created it simply to start a war. This is the whole idea of the policy decisions. Rameus respects his motherland, but has come to the conclusion that such a weapon is designed to start a war, not end it and as such he does not want a part of it. In the end he decides that he has had enough and leaves. It is ironic that even though this sub has a silent engine, one American submarine is able to track it. It knows what its signature sounds like and this seems to defeat the entire purpose of this silent engine. The thing that irked me about this movie is that the Russians are the bad guys and the Americans are the good guys. This was set during the Cold War and as such patriotism was required. The thing is that the politician in this movie is a liar and a cheat - a real slime bag, yet he comes out on top and the Russians are portrayed as being the idiots. The Americans land up with this first strike weapon and the Russians lose out big time. This is not surprising because the author is American and he is writing at a time when the Russians were bad and Americans were good. Yet this was written during the time I was a teenager and as such we loved the Russians because they were the bad guys and our parents (mine especially) would constantly rave about how bad they were. In the end I sympathise with the Russians because I do not see them as the evil empire, but rather the other side in a war in which can only be one winner. History is written by the victors and the victors are always seen as being the good guys, even though they probably are not. This is clear when we see the slimy politician in this movie. He is slime yet he is on the side of the winners - though I would hardly call him a good guy. Anyway, I still quite like this movie, and was disappointed with the sequels as they removed Alec Baldwin and replaced him with Harrison Ford. I hate it when they do that.

    The Hunt for Red October is a thriller based on the novel of the same name by Tom Clancy. It was directed by John McTiernan and stars Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin.This was the first of several films based on Tom Clancy's thrillers that presents eccentric CIA analyst Jack Ryan. The year was 1984. Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius sets the plot in motion when he murders his political adviser, burns his orders, and steers his submarine,Red October towards American waters, hoping to defect. The CIA, aware that the Red October was about to embark on an evasive mission to demonstrate its ability to avoid detection and fire its nuclear missiles upon U.S. installations, believes that Ramius is insane, and that he plans to start World War III. To cover their own behinds, the Russians back up the CIA's suspicion. Only Jack Ryan believes that Ramius' mission is not as apocalyptic as it seems -- and it is Ryan who is assigned to infiltrate the Red October to prove his theory. The first Jack Ryan thriller film is a supremely mounted film and well acted by Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery as Jack Ryan and Marko Ramius respectively.It was vastly enjoyable and entertaining that one will not regret watching it and spending many hours discussing about it after viewing the film.And most of all,it was a great adaptation of Tom Clancy's novel.

    Tom Clancy was almost a sleeper hit, in the novel world, anyways, back in the 1980's, and this first film in the Jack Ryan movie adaptations, is a true wonder. Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Sam Niell, James Earl Jones, and more big stars fill the screen in good, sometimes great performances that just enhance the experience. The film shines in the way that it explores submarines, not just the insides in a way like a documentary, but the mood of the sub, the way you could at almost anytime fire a missile and eliminate a city, the duty a seaman has and the pressure he is under with millions and billions of dollars of taxpayers money, and it is almost a haunting film at times, aided by Basil Poledouris' brilliant score. As for the Jack Ryan character, Alec Baldwin, I must admit, gives a realist performance as an up and excited guy who is an analyst on his first field job, sort of, that is. A great film also in its story, and a pace that is seemingly slow at times, but it works nonetheless.

    "The Hunt For Red October" is a 1990 film directed by John McTiernan and stars Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery. The film is adapted from the 1984 Tom Clancy novel about a Soviet nuclear submarine which drops off U.S. scanners, prompting a young CIA analyst (Baldwin) to scramble to find out what the captain's (Connery) motives really are. To start off, I love Tom Clancy. I'm a fairly big fan of his Splinter Cell, Rainbow SIx, and Ghost Recon franchises. I had also heard of "Red October" and that it was directed by the guy who made "Predator" and "Die Hard", so I was already pretty excited to watch this movie. In short, the film did not, in any way, disappoint. What kind of shocked and worried me about this is that this film was filed under the "Thriller" section on Netflix. . .and it's rated PG. Needless to say, this fact sort of worried me. I was wrong though - just because this movie is PG does not mean it isn't "thrilling" in any sense of the word. "Red October" is in fact an "edge of your seat" thriller by definition. Almost every facet of this film is excellent. The script, I found, was very witty and well written by Larry Ferguson. The acting was spectacular, specifically of course from Connery and Baldwin. The score was very awesome and appropriate for the source material. The special effects were very good, especially for the late 80's. I'd say that "The Hunt For Red October" is a solid thriller that will have a hard time disappointing many of its viewers.
