 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  After a botched mission in Cuba, professional mercenary Shale and his crew Joey Six, Hollan, Rem, and Wellman head home to Miami, Florida, where Shale is reunited with his fiance Jane Hetzko, who is a history teacher at Columbus High School in Miami. Some of Jane's students happen to be members of a street gang known as the "Kings of Destruction" (KOD), led by Juan Lacas, who has been terrorizing Jane. After Jane's kneecap is broken by a big seminole named Bull, she tells Shale that she believes Lacas ordered the attack, so Shale goes undercover as Jane's substitute, and initially, Jane has no idea that Shale is doing this. At the school, Shale meets principal Claude Rolle, librarian Hannah Dillon, and english and drama teacher Darrell Sherman. It turns out that Lacas is one of Jane's students. As Shale investigates the attack on Jane, he discovers that drugs are being circulated into the school. Shale even investigates local drug kingpin Johnny Glades, who may or may not have someone...

    (Plot) A mercenary is reunited with his fianc&eacute; after a failed mission in Cuba. The kids have a habit of terrorizing Jane and she ends up succumbing to injury. Tom Berenger is forced to take over her responsibilities and become the substitute teacher. He may have gotten a little more than he bargained for. Maybe it was Tom Berenger's stone faced performance, maybe it was the dullness that permeated for the whole movie, or maybe it was because I had nobody to root for. The answer? all of the above. It does have some scenes that are quite intense and gritty, but it's not nearly as powerful as it likes to believe. It does have a nice little twist near the end, but that's about it. Tom Berenger is pretty wooden here in my opinion. His stone faced performance got on my nerves. Diane Venora is fitfully sassy as the fianc&eacute;e. She did well. William Forsythe, Luis Guzman and others add good support Final Thoughts: I don't remember a whole lot about this movie. It wasn't terrible, just mundane and not very interesting. I'd check out other films if I were you. Followed by three DTV sequels which I have yet to see. 4.3/10

    If you've seen "Death Wish", "The Principal", "Dangerous Minds", "187", etc., then you'll know what to expect, and will enjoy "The Substitute". "High School High" is also one example, but since that was mostly comedy, at least when Jon Lovitz was on-screen, that one doesn't really count. On the surface, this is formula, but what's interesting is that unlike the aforementioned movies, or any other similar movie, this one doesn't turn the students into achievers, and the teacher doesn't take anyone under his wing. It's basically a Stallone, or a Schwarzeneggar, or a Seagall movie disguised as a movie about a school in the city. Also, you don't immediately realize the principal is part of the gang activity. I enjoyed this movie not just because it's formula, but also because of some unexpected moments, too. I'll have to say though, that Berenger is no Stallone or Schwarzeneggar. I was expecting more from the character. And the scenes with just him and Diane Venra aren't all that interesting, because they don't have any purpose, other than to remind us she is recuperating, all because of one of her students. *** out of ****

    This is like the ultimate "everyday" action movie. It's pulp fiction with a human touch. Tom Berenger is a beautiful warm hearted human actor. He makes roles seem human. I guess the weakness in that, is that since it's so human and less flashy, it may very well be the reason he never became a huge star - just human. He's so underrated. Anyway he is a big part in making this movie your ultimate take it easy and enjoy flick. This movie knows right from wrong and it gives us the satisfaction in a non cheesy way of supporting our belief that good will win in the end. Maybe I should have given it a 10. Cause it's a classic and perfect in it's genre. I guess it's a "B" movie that gets an A big time..

    While this movie isn't the greatest example of it's genre, it is a very fun film. I started out with fairly low expectations. But the story concept sounded good so I thought I would give it a try. A few actors were too stiff, and one was too much of a ham, the rest of the cast gave fairly to very solid performances. I know some viewers liked the idea of teachers finally getting back at the bad students. That was only a minor concern to me. What I liked was the military assault specialist that discovers that he has a taste for teaching. I also like the idea that everyone is trying to figure out whom he is working for when he is working for himself. I didn't like the way most of his team dies in the final engagement. On the whole, it was much better than I was expecting and I would recommend it for people who want an interesting action movie with some funny moments but don't want to have to think much while watching it.

    The Substitute is a rare timeless gems that many people will ignore because the mainstream media wasn't ready to handle the shear scope of this film. Tom Berenger plays a mercenary who solves and avenges his girlfriend's broken knee by infiltrating her school as a substitute teacher. The twist is that because the principal has insinuated police ties, Tom has no choice but to reassemble his team of commandos and go on a killing rampage that would make Rambo blush. Where most people would simply call law enforcement, Berenger would kill them all. There are some pretty major plot holes and the justification for many of the action scenes is laughable but this movie works because it doesn't take itself seriously. There is no reason that this movie can't be enjoyed by everyone and anyone.

    "FX" director Robert Mandel's urban crime thriller "The Substitute" fuses elements of "Blackboard Jungle" with "The Equalizer." In "Blackboard Jungle," a teacher (Glenn Ford) tangled with savage, inner-city youth. In the CBS-TV thriller series "The Equalizer," an urban security expert allowed his clients to resume life without fear from assailants. Tom Berenger stars as a covert operations specialist on holiday who finds himself back into the classroom to rumble with a drug czar and his killers. The action is as fast and as furious as one of the submachine guns fired in this larger-than-life, but exciting exercise in educational reform. Mandel and "Street Trash" scenarist Roy Frumkes, "Substitute 2" scribe Rocco Simonelli, and "Cat People" writer Alan Ormsby have created an entertaining, suspenseful, sometimes amusing, melodrama with a minor surprise or two. "Ghost Busters" star Ernie Hudson registers splendidly as a corrupt high school principal who abuses his authority by allowing sales of narcotics on his premises. An earnest, forthright teacher Jane Hetzko (Diane Venora of "True Crime") confronts high-ranking gang-banger Juan Lacas (Marc Anthony of "Hackers") during a campus brawl, and he doesn't like the way that she talks to him so he threatens her. Later, as Jane is jogging by herself along the beach, a thuggish Seminole confronts her and cracks one of her knee caps with a bat. Jane's off-again, on-again boyfriend Jonathan Shale (Tom Berenger of the "Sniper" movies)tangles briefly with the brute before the brute escapes. Jane lands in the hospital and Shale takes care of her. Shale calls for Jane's usual substitute, but the man isn't available. Instead, Shale gets one of his mercenary buddies, Rem (Luis Guzm&aacute;n of "Anger Management"), to put him into the school's computer system as James Smith with three diplomas from prestigious Ivy League universities. Shale has the time to devote to Jane's problem, because his men and he have completed a mission that attracted too much international attention and he has to cool it for a while. Meantime, he keeps his surviving commandos in line and out of harm's way. A job to guard drug shipments comes up, but once our virtuous hero learns that he would be killing to ensure the safe passage of narcotics, he turns the job down cold and reprimands his comrade, Joey 6 (Raymond Cruz of "The Rock") for setting up the interview. Instead, Shale masquerades as a substitute school teacher when he cannot get an actual substitute for Jane. He assembles his team and tells them that where drugs are concerned, money can be found in large quantities. This serves as their inducement to mobilize their special skills. Along the way, another caring teacher, Mr. Darrell Sherman (Glenn Plummer of "Saw 2") gets in the way of the villains, particularly Claude Rolle (Ernie Hudson of "Ghost Busters") and pays the ultimate price. The heroes and the villains turn the high school into a battlefield. The villains have stashed a lifetime's worth of cocaine in the school's maintenance garage and Hollan (William Forsythe of "Once Upon A Time in America") rigs it up with explosives so when the bad guys go to retrieve it, they are blown up. Not all of the good guys survive this bullet-riddled shoot'em up. "The Substitute" ranks as an above-average thriller.

    Tom Berenger, why are you not in the same position Bruce Willis and Stallone are in now? The Substitute is every bit as good as Die Hard and Rambo, switching these backgrounds for a gritty school in LA. Berenger stars as Shale (isn't that a great name for an action hero?), a battle scarred mercenary who's still haunted by a number of casualties after a recent mission to Cuba. He gets home to find his girlfriend (Diane Venora), a teacher, kneecapped, most likely a result of her resistance to drug kingpin/student Juan Lackas (Marc Anthony). Shale gets the remaining members of his mercenary team together for a crackdown on the corruption of not only the students, but the possibly sleazy Principal Claude Rolle (Ernie Husdon). (That's a classic badguy name too, Claude Rolle.) The backgrounds are real, and the school itself is a great symbol. It's covered in graffiti, which adds to the gravity the films produces. Another thing, "The Substitute" never, at any point, gets unrealistic. Things explode as they must in an action picture, but at a level that always feel legitimate and not too fake. This is an action classic, and it's a mystery to me why it hasn't been inducted into the same hall of fame category as Rambo and Die Hard. Well worth your money.

    Here's one of those immensely satisfying albeit somewhat unlikely flicks in which the scumbags really get their just deserts. Think Dangerous Minds crossed with Death Wish and you'll have a pretty good gist of things here. The ever excellent Tom Berenger stars as a tough as nails mercenary who seeks retribution after his teacher girlfriend is viciously assaulted on the orders of a high school gang calling themselves the Kings Of Destruction. And what better way for our hero to get up close and personal with his quarry than to take the now vacant teaching position his girl friend has left at school and to pose as a substitute. In this assumed role our man quickly weeds out the problem students with some no nonsense discipline which will be sure to raise a smile on most viewers faces. Matters turn out to be a bit more complex however when it is revealed that the school principle is not quite such a genial chap as he at first appears.....in fact far from it as he is orchestrating the gang within his school and trafficking drugs via them. Subsequently our hero enlists the aid of his mercenary buddies to lend a hand and all merry hell subsequently breaks out including in one hilarious scene, one of our boys firing off a rocket launcher down a school corridor(!!!!!) Yes, whilst realism this may be woefully lacking, in fun it more than makes up for! Go on, treat yourself to this wonderful slice of carefree and highly satisfying escapism - you know you want to.

    What strikes me as strange is that this film has a 5.5 star rating on IMDb - why?? Even more of a crime like Perfect Weapon, why hasn't this seen the time of day on DVD? Hell, I managed to obtain a legit DVD from Sweden(with a very cool menu by the way!) To me, (and would have to agree with another comment on this board), this is very much an unofficial Punisher movie. If anyone's read the War Journals, it echos a very similar storyline where Frank Castle goes undercover in a rundown school. With the way society is, this film has a strong message on how to deal with scumbag students who won't tow the line (yeah, call me Dirty Harry!) I love Ernie Hudson who plays a very unlikely principal, as well as Diane Venora and William Forsythe. In an age where action demands being either CGI or stylized choreography, the action here at least, kicks ass. Tom Berenger not only looks like Frank Castle, but handles action with gutso and relishes every opportunity. In my opinion, he is such a gifted actor and should've been given better roles after this. If you liked James Belushi in The Principal, you'll definitely love this - and trust me, it gets better with repeated viewing. Do yourself a favour and order a DVD from Sweden!

    this movie was not bad.it's a little too dramatic for my tastes.there is some action,just not as much as i'd hoped for.i was bored for a lot of it.there's a lot of talking in this movie,but nothing memorable about that aspect.the concept has likely been done before.a new substitute takes over teaching duties usually in a classroom full of troubled teens/gang members,delinquents,etc.but this sub is no ordinary sub.he has skills.in fact he isn't actually a teacher.but he pretend to be.he has ulterior motives.usually,someone he knows has been either killed or seriously injured.so he poses as a teacher to find out the truth.he usually teaches the students,some of them anyway,respect for themselves and tries to get them on the right track in life.that's pretty much the plot line for the substitute,among other similar movies.if you like that kind of movie,and you don't mind a fair amount of dialogue,with a bit of action,you might like "The Substitute".i didn't like it all that much,so i'd have to give it a 5/10

Yes, whilst realism this may be woefully lacking, in fun it more than makes up for! Go on, treat yourself to this wonderful slice of carefree and highly satisfying escapism - you know you want to.

    What strikes me as strange is that this film has a 5.5 star rating on IMDb - why?? Even more of a crime like Perfect Weapon, why hasn't this seen the time of day on DVD? Hell, I managed to obtain a legit DVD from Sweden(with a very cool menu by the way!) To me, (and would have to agree with another comment on this board), this is very much an unofficial Punisher movie. If anyone's read the War Journals, it echos a very similar storyline where Frank Castle goes undercover in a rundown school. With the way society is, this film has a strong message on how to deal with scumbag students who won't tow the line (yeah, call me Dirty Harry!) I love Ernie Hudson who plays a very unlikely principal, as well as Diane Venora and William Forsythe. In an age where action demands being either CGI or stylized choreography, the action here at least, kicks ass. Tom Berenger not only looks like Frank Castle, but handles action with gutso and relishes every opportunity. In my opinion, he is such a gifted actor and should've been given better roles after this. If you liked James Belushi in The Principal, you'll definitely love this - and trust me, it gets better with repeated viewing. Do yourself a favour and order a DVD from Sweden!

    this movie was not bad.it's a little too dramatic for my tastes.there is some action,just not as much as i'd hoped for.i was bored for a lot of it.there's a lot of talking in this movie,but nothing memorable about that aspect.the concept has likely been done before.a new substitute takes over teaching duties usually in a classroom full of troubled teens/gang members,delinquents,etc.but this sub is no ordinary sub.he has skills.in fact he isn't actually a teacher.but he pretend to be.he has ulterior motives.usually,someone he knows has been either killed or seriously injured.so he poses as a teacher to find out the truth.he usually teaches the students,some of them anyway,respect for themselves and tries to get them on the right track in life.that's pretty much the plot line for the substitute,among other similar movies.if you like that kind of movie,and you don't mind a fair amount of dialogue,with a bit of action,you might like "The Substitute".i didn't like it all that much,so i'd have to give it a 5/10

    (Plot) A mercenary is reunited with his fianc&eacute; after a failed mission in Cuba. The kids have a habit of terrorizing Jane and she ends up succumbing to injury. Tom Berenger is forced to take over her responsibilities and become the substitute teacher. He may have gotten a little more than he bargained for. Maybe it was Tom Berenger's stone faced performance, maybe it was the dullness that permeated for the whole movie, or maybe it was because I had nobody to root for. The answer? all of the above. It does have some scenes that are quite intense and gritty, but it's not nearly as powerful as it likes to believe. It does have a nice little twist near the end, but that's about it. Tom Berenger is pretty wooden here in my opinion. His stone faced performance got on my nerves. Diane Venora is fitfully sassy as the fianc&eacute;e. She did well. William Forsythe, Luis Guzman and others add good support Final Thoughts: I don't remember a whole lot about this movie. It wasn't terrible, just mundane and not very interesting. I'd check out other films if I were you. Followed by three DTV sequels which I have yet to see. 4.3/10

    If you've seen "Death Wish", "The Principal", "Dangerous Minds", "187", etc., then you'll know what to expect, and will enjoy "The Substitute". "High School High" is also one example, but since that was mostly comedy, at least when Jon Lovitz was on-screen, that one doesn't really count. On the surface, this is formula, but what's interesting is that unlike the aforementioned movies, or any other similar movie, this one doesn't turn the students into achievers, and the teacher doesn't take anyone under his wing. It's basically a Stallone, or a Schwarzeneggar, or a Seagall movie disguised as a movie about a school in the city. Also, you don't immediately realize the principal is part of the gang activity. I enjoyed this movie not just because it's formula, but also because of some unexpected moments, too. I'll have to say though, that Berenger is no Stallone or Schwarzeneggar. I was expecting more from the character. And the scenes with just him and Diane Venra aren't all that interesting, because they don't have any purpose, other than to remind us she is recuperating, all because of one of her students. *** out of ****

    This is like the ultimate "everyday" action movie. It's pulp fiction with a human touch. Tom Berenger is a beautiful warm hearted human actor. He makes roles seem human. I guess the weakness in that, is that since it's so human and less flashy, it may very well be the reason he never became a huge star - just human. He's so underrated. Anyway he is a big part in making this movie your ultimate take it easy and enjoy flick. This movie knows right from wrong and it gives us the satisfaction in a non cheesy way of supporting our belief that good will win in the end. Maybe I should have given it a 10. Cause it's a classic and perfect in it's genre. I guess it's a "B" movie that gets an A big time..

    While this movie isn't the greatest example of it's genre, it is a very fun film. I started out with fairly low expectations. But the story concept sounded good so I thought I would give it a try. A few actors were too stiff, and one was too much of a ham, the rest of the cast gave fairly to very solid performances. I know some viewers liked the idea of teachers finally getting back at the bad students. That was only a minor concern to me. What I liked was the military assault specialist that discovers that he has a taste for teaching. I also like the idea that everyone is trying to figure out whom he is working for when he is working for himself. I didn't like the way most of his team dies in the final engagement. On the whole, it was much better than I was expecting and I would recommend it for people who want an interesting action movie with some funny moments but don't want to have to think much while watching it.

    The Substitute is a rare timeless gems that many people will ignore because the mainstream media wasn't ready to handle the shear scope of this film. Tom Berenger plays a mercenary who solves and avenges his girlfriend's broken knee by infiltrating her school as a substitute teacher. The twist is that because the principal has insinuated police ties, Tom has no choice but to reassemble his team of commandos and go on a killing rampage that would make Rambo blush. Where most people would simply call law enforcement, Berenger would kill them all. There are some pretty major plot holes and the justification for many of the action scenes is laughable but this movie works because it doesn't take itself seriously. There is no reason that this movie can't be enjoyed by everyone and anyone.

    "FX" director Robert Mandel's urban crime thriller "The Substitute" fuses elements of "Blackboard Jungle" with "The Equalizer." In "Blackboard Jungle," a teacher (Glenn Ford) tangled with savage, inner-city youth. In the CBS-TV thriller series "The Equalizer," an urban security expert allowed his clients to resume life without fear from assailants. Tom Berenger stars as a covert operations specialist on holiday who finds himself back into the classroom to rumble with a drug czar and his killers. The action is as fast and as furious as one of the submachine guns fired in this larger-than-life, but exciting exercise in educational reform. Mandel and "Street Trash" scenarist Roy Frumkes, "Substitute 2" scribe Rocco Simonelli, and "Cat People" writer Alan Ormsby have created an entertaining, suspenseful, sometimes amusing, melodrama with a minor surprise or two. "Ghost Busters" star Ernie Hudson registers splendidly as a corrupt high school principal who abuses his authority by allowing sales of narcotics on his premises. An earnest, forthright teacher Jane Hetzko (Diane Venora of "True Crime") confronts high-ranking gang-banger Juan Lacas (Marc Anthony of "Hackers") during a campus brawl, and he doesn't like the way that she talks to him so he threatens her. Later, as Jane is jogging by herself along the beach, a thuggish Seminole confronts her and cracks one of her knee caps with a bat. Jane's off-again, on-again boyfriend Jonathan Shale (Tom Berenger of the "Sniper" movies)tangles briefly with the brute before the brute escapes. Jane lands in the hospital and Shale takes care of her. Shale calls for Jane's usual substitute, but the man isn't available. Instead, Shale gets one of his mercenary buddies, Rem (Luis Guzm&aacute;n of "Anger Management"), to put him into the school's computer system as James Smith with three diplomas from prestigious Ivy League universities. Shale has the time to devote to Jane's problem, because his men and he have completed a mission that attracted too much international attention and he has to cool it for a while. Meantime, he keeps his surviving commandos in line and out of harm's way. A job to guard drug shipments comes up, but once our virtuous hero learns that he would be killing to ensure the safe passage of narcotics, he turns the job down cold and reprimands his comrade, Joey 6 (Raymond Cruz of "The Rock") for setting up the interview. Instead, Shale masquerades as a substitute school teacher when he cannot get an actual substitute for Jane. He assembles his team and tells them that where drugs are concerned, money can be found in large quantities. This serves as their inducement to mobilize their special skills. Along the way, another caring teacher, Mr. Darrell Sherman (Glenn Plummer of "Saw 2") gets in the way of the villains, particularly Claude Rolle (Ernie Hudson of "Ghost Busters") and pays the ultimate price. The heroes and the villains turn the high school into a battlefield. The villains have stashed a lifetime's worth of cocaine in the school's maintenance garage and Hollan (William Forsythe of "Once Upon A Time in America") rigs it up with explosives so when the bad guys go to retrieve it, they are blown up. Not all of the good guys survive this bullet-riddled shoot'em up. "The Substitute" ranks as an above-average thriller.

    Tom Berenger, why are you not in the same position Bruce Willis and Stallone are in now? The Substitute is every bit as good as Die Hard and Rambo, switching these backgrounds for a gritty school in LA. Berenger stars as Shale (isn't that a great name for an action hero?), a battle scarred mercenary who's still haunted by a number of casualties after a recent mission to Cuba. He gets home to find his girlfriend (Diane Venora), a teacher, kneecapped, most likely a result of her resistance to drug kingpin/student Juan Lackas (Marc Anthony). Shale gets the remaining members of his mercenary team together for a crackdown on the corruption of not only the students, but the possibly sleazy Principal Claude Rolle (Ernie Husdon). (That's a classic badguy name too, Claude Rolle.) The backgrounds are real, and the school itself is a great symbol. It's covered in graffiti, which adds to the gravity the films produces. Another thing, "The Substitute" never, at any point, gets unrealistic. Things explode as they must in an action picture, but at a level that always feel legitimate and not too fake. This is an action classic, and it's a mystery to me why it hasn't been inducted into the same hall of fame category as Rambo and Die Hard. Well worth your money.

    Here's one of those immensely satisfying albeit somewhat unlikely flicks in which the scumbags really get their just deserts. Think Dangerous Minds crossed with Death Wish and you'll have a pretty good gist of things here. The ever excellent Tom Berenger stars as a tough as nails mercenary who seeks retribution after his teacher girlfriend is viciously assaulted on the orders of a high school gang calling themselves the Kings Of Destruction. And what better way for our hero to get up close and personal with his quarry than to take the now vacant teaching position his girl friend has left at school and to pose as a substitute. In this assumed role our man quickly weeds out the problem students with some no nonsense discipline which will be sure to raise a smile on most viewers faces. Matters turn out to be a bit more complex however when it is revealed that the school principle is not quite such a genial chap as he at first appears.....in fact far from it as he is orchestrating the gang within his school and trafficking drugs via them. Subsequently our hero enlists the aid of his mercenary buddies to lend a hand and all merry hell subsequently breaks out including in one hilarious scene, one of our boys firing off a rocket launcher down a school corridor(!!!!!) Yes, whilst realism this may be woefully lacking, in fun it more than makes up for! Go on, treat yourself to this wonderful slice of carefree and highly satisfying escapism - you know you want to.

The ever excellent Tom Berenger stars as a tough as nails mercenary who seeks retribution after his teacher girlfriend is viciously assaulted on the orders of a high school gang calling themselves the Kings Of Destruction. And what better way for our hero to get up close and personal with his quarry than to take the now vacant teaching position his girl friend has left at school and to pose as a substitute. In this assumed role our man quickly weeds out the problem students with some no nonsense discipline which will be sure to raise a smile on most viewers faces. Matters turn out to be a bit more complex however when it is revealed that the school principle is not quite such a genial chap as he at first appears.....in fact far from it as he is orchestrating the gang within his school and trafficking drugs via them. Subsequently our hero enlists the aid of his mercenary buddies to lend a hand and all merry hell subsequently breaks out including in one hilarious scene, one of our boys firing off a rocket launcher down a school corridor(!!!!!) Yes, whilst realism this may be woefully lacking, in fun it more than makes up for! Go on, treat yourself to this wonderful slice of carefree and highly satisfying escapism - you know you want to.

    What strikes me as strange is that this film has a 5.5 star rating on IMDb - why?? Even more of a crime like Perfect Weapon, why hasn't this seen the time of day on DVD? Hell, I managed to obtain a legit DVD from Sweden(with a very cool menu by the way!) To me, (and would have to agree with another comment on this board), this is very much an unofficial Punisher movie. If anyone's read the War Journals, it echos a very similar storyline where Frank Castle goes undercover in a rundown school. With the way society is, this film has a strong message on how to deal with scumbag students who won't tow the line (yeah, call me Dirty Harry!) I love Ernie Hudson who plays a very unlikely principal, as well as Diane Venora and William Forsythe. In an age where action demands being either CGI or stylized choreography, the action here at least, kicks ass. Tom Berenger not only looks like Frank Castle, but handles action with gutso and relishes every opportunity. In my opinion, he is such a gifted actor and should've been given better roles after this. If you liked James Belushi in The Principal, you'll definitely love this - and trust me, it gets better with repeated viewing. Do yourself a favour and order a DVD from Sweden!

    this movie was not bad.it's a little too dramatic for my tastes.there is some action,just not as much as i'd hoped for.i was bored for a lot of it.there's a lot of talking in this movie,but nothing memorable about that aspect.the concept has likely been done before.a new substitute takes over teaching duties usually in a classroom full of troubled teens/gang members,delinquents,etc.but this sub is no ordinary sub.he has skills.in fact he isn't actually a teacher.but he pretend to be.he has ulterior motives.usually,someone he knows has been either killed or seriously injured.so he poses as a teacher to find out the truth.he usually teaches the students,some of them anyway,respect for themselves and tries to get them on the right track in life.that's pretty much the plot line for the substitute,among other similar movies.if you like that kind of movie,and you don't mind a fair amount of dialogue,with a bit of action,you might like "The Substitute".i didn't like it all that much,so i'd have to give it a 5/10

    (Plot) A mercenary is reunited with his fianc&eacute; after a failed mission in Cuba. The kids have a habit of terrorizing Jane and she ends up succumbing to injury. Tom Berenger is forced to take over her responsibilities and become the substitute teacher. He may have gotten a little more than he bargained for. Maybe it was Tom Berenger's stone faced performance, maybe it was the dullness that permeated for the whole movie, or maybe it was because I had nobody to root for. The answer? all of the above. It does have some scenes that are quite intense and gritty, but it's not nearly as powerful as it likes to believe. It does have a nice little twist near the end, but that's about it. Tom Berenger is pretty wooden here in my opinion. His stone faced performance got on my nerves. Diane Venora is fitfully sassy as the fianc&eacute;e. She did well. William Forsythe, Luis Guzman and others add good support Final Thoughts: I don't remember a whole lot about this movie. It wasn't terrible, just mundane and not very interesting. I'd check out other films if I were you. Followed by three DTV sequels which I have yet to see. 4.3/10

    If you've seen "Death Wish", "The Principal", "Dangerous Minds", "187", etc., then you'll know what to expect, and will enjoy "The Substitute". "High School High" is also one example, but since that was mostly comedy, at least when Jon Lovitz was on-screen, that one doesn't really count. On the surface, this is formula, but what's interesting is that unlike the aforementioned movies, or any other similar movie, this one doesn't turn the students into achievers, and the teacher doesn't take anyone under his wing. It's basically a Stallone, or a Schwarzeneggar, or a Seagall movie disguised as a movie about a school in the city. Also, you don't immediately realize the principal is part of the gang activity. I enjoyed this movie not just because it's formula, but also because of some unexpected moments, too. I'll have to say though, that Berenger is no Stallone or Schwarzeneggar. I was expecting more from the character. And the scenes with just him and Diane Venra aren't all that interesting, because they don't have any purpose, other than to remind us she is recuperating, all because of one of her students. *** out of ****

    This is like the ultimate "everyday" action movie. It's pulp fiction with a human touch. Tom Berenger is a beautiful warm hearted human actor. He makes roles seem human. I guess the weakness in that, is that since it's so human and less flashy, it may very well be the reason he never became a huge star - just human. He's so underrated. Anyway he is a big part in making this movie your ultimate take it easy and enjoy flick. This movie knows right from wrong and it gives us the satisfaction in a non cheesy way of supporting our belief that good will win in the end. Maybe I should have given it a 10. Cause it's a classic and perfect in it's genre. I guess it's a "B" movie that gets an A big time..

    While this movie isn't the greatest example of it's genre, it is a very fun film. I started out with fairly low expectations. But the story concept sounded good so I thought I would give it a try. A few actors were too stiff, and one was too much of a ham, the rest of the cast gave fairly to very solid performances. I know some viewers liked the idea of teachers finally getting back at the bad students. That was only a minor concern to me. What I liked was the military assault specialist that discovers that he has a taste for teaching. I also like the idea that everyone is trying to figure out whom he is working for when he is working for himself. I didn't like the way most of his team dies in the final engagement. On the whole, it was much better than I was expecting and I would recommend it for people who want an interesting action movie with some funny moments but don't want to have to think much while watching it.

    The Substitute is a rare timeless gems that many people will ignore because the mainstream media wasn't ready to handle the shear scope of this film. Tom Berenger plays a mercenary who solves and avenges his girlfriend's broken knee by infiltrating her school as a substitute teacher. The twist is that because the principal has insinuated police ties, Tom has no choice but to reassemble his team of commandos and go on a killing rampage that would make Rambo blush. Where most people would simply call law enforcement, Berenger would kill them all. There are some pretty major plot holes and the justification for many of the action scenes is laughable but this movie works because it doesn't take itself seriously. There is no reason that this movie can't be enjoyed by everyone and anyone.

    "FX" director Robert Mandel's urban crime thriller "The Substitute" fuses elements of "Blackboard Jungle" with "The Equalizer." In "Blackboard Jungle," a teacher (Glenn Ford) tangled with savage, inner-city youth. In the CBS-TV thriller series "The Equalizer," an urban security expert allowed his clients to resume life without fear from assailants. Tom Berenger stars as a covert operations specialist on holiday who finds himself back into the classroom to rumble with a drug czar and his killers. The action is as fast and as furious as one of the submachine guns fired in this larger-than-life, but exciting exercise in educational reform. Mandel and "Street Trash" scenarist Roy Frumkes, "Substitute 2" scribe Rocco Simonelli, and "Cat People" writer Alan Ormsby have created an entertaining, suspenseful, sometimes amusing, melodrama with a minor surprise or two. "Ghost Busters" star Ernie Hudson registers splendidly as a corrupt high school principal who abuses his authority by allowing sales of narcotics on his premises. An earnest, forthright teacher Jane Hetzko (Diane Venora of "True Crime") confronts high-ranking gang-banger Juan Lacas (Marc Anthony of "Hackers") during a campus brawl, and he doesn't like the way that she talks to him so he threatens her. Later, as Jane is jogging by herself along the beach, a thuggish Seminole confronts her and cracks one of her knee caps with a bat. Jane's off-again, on-again boyfriend Jonathan Shale (Tom Berenger of the "Sniper" movies)tangles briefly with the brute before the brute escapes. Jane lands in the hospital and Shale takes care of her. Shale calls for Jane's usual substitute, but the man isn't available. Instead, Shale gets one of his mercenary buddies, Rem (Luis Guzm&aacute;n of "Anger Management"), to put him into the school's computer system as James Smith with three diplomas from prestigious Ivy League universities. Shale has the time to devote to Jane's problem, because his men and he have completed a mission that attracted too much international attention and he has to cool it for a while. Meantime, he keeps his surviving commandos in line and out of harm's way. A job to guard drug shipments comes up, but once our virtuous hero learns that he would be killing to ensure the safe passage of narcotics, he turns the job down cold and reprimands his comrade, Joey 6 (Raymond Cruz of "The Rock") for setting up the interview. Instead, Shale masquerades as a substitute school teacher when he cannot get an actual substitute for Jane. He assembles his team and tells them that where drugs are concerned, money can be found in large quantities. This serves as their inducement to mobilize their special skills. Along the way, another caring teacher, Mr. Darrell Sherman (Glenn Plummer of "Saw 2") gets in the way of the villains, particularly Claude Rolle (Ernie Hudson of "Ghost Busters") and pays the ultimate price. The heroes and the villains turn the high school into a battlefield. The villains have stashed a lifetime's worth of cocaine in the school's maintenance garage and Hollan (William Forsythe of "Once Upon A Time in America") rigs it up with explosives so when the bad guys go to retrieve it, they are blown up. Not all of the good guys survive this bullet-riddled shoot'em up. "The Substitute" ranks as an above-average thriller.

    Tom Berenger, why are you not in the same position Bruce Willis and Stallone are in now? The Substitute is every bit as good as Die Hard and Rambo, switching these backgrounds for a gritty school in LA. Berenger stars as Shale (isn't that a great name for an action hero?), a battle scarred mercenary who's still haunted by a number of casualties after a recent mission to Cuba. He gets home to find his girlfriend (Diane Venora), a teacher, kneecapped, most likely a result of her resistance to drug kingpin/student Juan Lackas (Marc Anthony). Shale gets the remaining members of his mercenary team together for a crackdown on the corruption of not only the students, but the possibly sleazy Principal Claude Rolle (Ernie Husdon). (That's a classic badguy name too, Claude Rolle.) The backgrounds are real, and the school itself is a great symbol. It's covered in graffiti, which adds to the gravity the films produces. Another thing, "The Substitute" never, at any point, gets unrealistic. Things explode as they must in an action picture, but at a level that always feel legitimate and not too fake. This is an action classic, and it's a mystery to me why it hasn't been inducted into the same hall of fame category as Rambo and Die Hard. Well worth your money.
