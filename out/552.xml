    A surprisingly strong cast of solid actors(past & future Academy Award winners Ben Kingsly & Forest Whitaker among them!), and a good director(Roger Donaldson) all involved in a trashy Sci-Fi story about an alien replicated from captured DNA in a secret government experiment, being pursued by a crack team of scientists and soldiers after she escapes, and wrecks havoc across the city as it becomes determined to reproduce its species on Earth, or die trying... Nothing new or original in this story at all, certainly not thought-provoking Science Fiction, but is slickly put together, though why such fuss was made about such low-rent material is unknown...

    This is a B Movie trapped in an A Production. It tries to break free of its Fancy-Pants foundation and succeeds with some Charm. There is a Name Cast here headlined by an Oscar Winner, Ben Kingsley giving what must be the worst Performance of his Career. The Scene in the Lab when the Scientist are trapped with the "New Alien" is downright deplorable and He and the Director should be ashamed. The Movie is a lot of Sci-Fi and Horror Movie Fun. The central theme here is Sex overlaid by all the Gore and expensive SFX and Action. It is a Sex Story (think Kinsey and Freud on Acid), and is the prime of this pump. The Sex is sexy, the Violence is violent, the Gore is gory, the Alien looks Alien, and the Script is, well that's the rub. The Dialog is sometimes so Corny, Clich&eacute;d, and Bad that one can only hope that it was an attempt at Cheap Laughs and aimed at less than the usual Cerebral Sci-Fi intellect. But who knows. Most of this isn't even as good as those "penny a word" Pulps. Overall this will not disappoint Fans of Fangoria and Cinefantastique and casual Folks slumming for a Thrill, but this isn't really anything more than an Entertaining Movie based on past expectations to do nothing more and nothing less at the Drive-In or a Saturday Matin&eacute;e.

    Somehow this knockabout trash about an escaped alien-human hybrid in search of a mate managed to avoid the straight-to-video pile despite being little more than an excuse for a few car chases and many sightings of Natasha Henstridge's knockers. In a stroke of luck, the first programmes Henstridge sees on TV once she's on the loose teach her how to use money and credit cards, drive, have sex, dye her hair and crash a car into a pylon, all of which come in handy as the plot unfolds. Meanwhile Ben Kingsley and Forest Whitaker take it all too seriously, Alfred Molina is funny on purpose, the score is atmospheric if reminiscent of 'Aliens' in places, and there's a nicely played romance between Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger. This is, of course, absolute rubbish, but there's a sense that the movie knows that and as a result it's all rather likable.

    This movie is B-Grade Sci-Fi with copious amounts of nudity on the part of Ms.Hestridge. Aliens send us a DNA code, and we combine it with human DNA and create a "Docile" female hybrid, who proceeds to fornicate and kill her way across Los Angeles. Unlike it's sloppy sequels, this movie is tight, the characters are well-written, and you get a sense of tension as Sil and her pursuers track each other. Sil is actually a sympathetic monster. She didn't ask to be created or programmed to destroy humanity. Most annoying character is Forrest Whitacker, who was barely following the "Don't go full" rule from "Tropic Thunder". He states things like "Captain Obvious".

    As this movie came to an end, Dr. Baker (Marg Helgenberger) asked a question that I thought was surprisingly thought provoking, given that the movie as a whole wasn't especially thought provoking. According to the story, several years before, SETI (The Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence) had received a signal from an alien civilization. They interpreted it as having been a friendly signal sent in response to signals from earth. The signal included an alien DNA code, in response to a human DNA code that had been sent into space. The scientists decided to implant the alien DNA into a human ovum to make an alien- human hybrid creature. OK. (I suppose the opening is thought provoking as well, in depicting this poor, human looking young girl locked in what was little more than a comfortable cage with little contact with anyone, but it was the ending quote I found most thought provoking - from Dr. Baker: "she was half us and half something else. I wonder what half was the predatory half?" Good question! (Maybe the aliens tried the same experiment with our DNA with equally disastrous results and were trying to get back at us!) You see, this hybrid was predatory. It was a killer. It grew rapidly, reached maturity quickly and had the desire to mate and reproduce and would do whatever it took to find the right partner. If that included killing, so be it. But, yeah, from what we were told, the aliens seemed friendly enough. So where did the predatory half come from? Us? Interesting, and thought-provoking enough that it actually made me raise my estimation of the movie just a bit. Having said, that, this is overall not a great movie. It has some moments. No doubt about that. Some of the animation - revolving around the alien in the underground caverns near the end of the movie - was pretty primitive looking, though. There was really no need for Dr. Baker and Preston (Michael Madsen) to get together romantically, and Forrest Whitaker's character of the empath Dan seemed really out of place. In fact, the movie seemed to reach its silliest pretty early on when Xavier (Ben Kingsley) gathered this team who had been brought together to search out and destroy the creature, looked at Preston (who was some sort of special ops/government hit man type) and said to him "as the non-scientist among us ..." "THE" non-scientist? Are we to infer that Xavier considered an empath to be a scientist? Pretty silly line. One line, yes, but it stuck in my head for some reason. Anyway. The cast here is a very interesting one. It ranges from the very well known and accomplished Ben Kingsley to the (at the time) unknown and not at all accomplished Natasha Henstridge, who has never really built a major acting career out of this beginning. She's quite beautiful, but she didn't really blow me away. (As an aside, when I lived for a few years in Newfoundland, I lived near her home town of Springdale and actually knew a couple of people who were related to her and some who knew her as a child when the family would return home to visit after moving away. I actually was living there when this movie was released, so it created quite a buzz that one of Newfoundland's own was starring in a movie!) Between Kingsley and Henstridge, there were other faces, some (like Whitaker or Alfred Molina) better known (to me anyway) than others (such as Madsen or Helgenberger.) So there was quite a range of talent and experience in this. Kingsley's character looked a bit silly in the end as he picked up the flame thrower to go after the creature. I still see him as Ghandi, I guess, and Ghandi with a flame thrower is not an image my brain can process easily! In fact, at various times scattered throughout this I picked up an almost tongue in cheek attitude in the movie. This isn't great but it also isn't really bad, and, yes, it does have its moments. (5/10)

    Well, I think we can all recall what makes an exploitation film and how it relates to this movie. Gratuitous sex and nudity-check, a plot so simplistic and yet so poorly executed-check, a monster so cheesy that you can't help but giggle at it's presence in what are supposed to be serious scenes-check! When I was viewing this film, I felt as if this was a rejected porno-parody from the 1970's. An alien monster that needs to breed so it goes around and tries to sleep with any guy that she can find. Surprisingly the film boasts an all-star cast. While they no doubt bring some pretty top notch acting, the story cannot be saved. On another note, this movie is a perfect example of how over-dependence on CGI will no doubt make your movie look positively stupid and silly in only a matter of 17 years. There are movies from the 1970s that have more convincing monsters than this one! With that I can only say that the movie is dumb, however if you want a good laugh and go in with the expectation that it's going to be nothing but a cheesy good time, then you may find some joy in this picture.

    This is not just a cheesier, trashier knockoff of the second Terminator with some Alien and nudity thrown in. It has something else going. You have four 'watchers', four pairs of eyes led by the scientific 'mastermind' of an experiment in engineering hybrid vision. One is an action nut, one is intuitive, the other two are analytical minds. All four watch and make guesses on the direction that the monster movie plot is taking. Instead of this enhancing the product, it only reveals limitations in the work. Each of the four is as broadly characterized as the rest. Each one is played by an actor who simply 'looks' the part - Madsen as the cocky bastard - and will need no substantial acting chops to pull it off - except the analyst woman, who is a nondescript blonde and only there it seems to show some skin. The movie does not transform as we switch to a different point-of-view of the hybrid vision. In spite of the movie's structure to the contrary, it has one fabric and it's squarely rooted in action dynamics. And you can see this carried over in the cinematic presentation of the monster, another aspect of engineered vision. Giger has come up with pretty cool tentacles and cocoon. But it's not half of it in shadows and half of it fused in the fabric and walls of the film, as in the first Alien. It is all of it in front of the camera. We see more, register less. There is a memorable dream scene. It is quite obviously separated from the 'reality' of the film - nothing here bleeds two ways, all the energy of watching goes to satisfy the desire to. It is fun to watch, as derivative and comfortable as a pair of slippers. And it is once again showcased in the film that Ben Kingsley is the most corny and ridiculous presence in movies. Still. I am tapping this for my cinematic Los Angeles project.

    I rather enjoyed this story about scientists taking the extra-terrestrial advice about reshaping DNA and then growing something from it only to have it escape, destroy, kill, kill, kill, kill, and have all the moral empathy of a rock. Producer Frank Mancuso Jr. does a pretty good job here bestowing a generous budget for special effects(H. R. Giger designed the creature), the cast which includes heavyweights like Ben Kingley, Forrest Whitaker, Alfred Molina(SOOO young here) as well as always fun to watch Michael Madsen and beauties Marge Helgenberger, newcomer Natasha Henstridge and a very young Michelle Willimas, a decent script, very workmanlike directing from Roger Donaldson(who generally does a good job creating suspense and action). All of these add up for a roller-coaster THAT did keep me on the edge of my seat. I cared about the characters, the story was inventive, and the acting was very good for a vehicle like this. Are there some big holes in the script? You betcha! Are some of the lines and the ending in particular a bit troublesome to swallow? Yes, again, but I liked the movie nonetheless. Kinglsey is very good in his role as a bureaucrat. Whitaker excels as an empath. Henstridge is absolutely stunning and very fresh. This is your typical government makes-a-mistake-then-gathers-a-group-of-experts film, but one that I thought was very well done and highly entertaining.

    I'm almost ashamed to say that the exquisitely perfect body of a fairly often nude Natasha Henstridge is my main reason for enjoying 'Species'. Aside of that, the film now seems slightly laughable, the SFX elementary and Alfred Molina, plain awful. Forest Whittaker isn't much better and Michael Madsen just stupid. Ben Kingsley adds some credence as the ruthless scientist who has "developed" the little girl who then goes on to grow up into a sex hungry alien who only wants to reproduce her own 'Species' with the help of human sperm. It's a film that I can quarter watch, whilst doing something else. I don't take it seriously and there is little suspense and is certainly not in the league of 'Alien' and the like. I don't really like any of the sequels and wouldn't watch them again. Yes, 7/10 is probably way too generous, but we all have illogical reasoning when it comes to things we really like.

    After escaping from a government lab, a team is gathered to track down he half-human, half-alien being disguised as a beautiful woman as she leaves a blood-soaked trail of carnage looking to mate. This wasn't all that bad and certainly has a lot going for it. The action-movie focus during the latter half results in some fine moments, as they chase her around town leading to scenes like the freeway chase into the hillside or the spectacular series of stalking and shoot-outs in the underground caves at the finale, among other top choices. The underground scenes in particular are among the film's best parts, as the disorienting caves, dark pits and waterways provide some great locations to generate some amazing shootouts and spectacle amongst it all. Other big action scenes are spread throughout the film and really help mask the fact that this is slightly too long, it's only big flaw, since there's several subplots that last too long or don't need to be included at all. Fortunately, the marvelous special effects for the alien being, abundant gore in the graphic kills and copious nudity also manage to overcome the film's rather weak CGI for the finale, and with enough tension and suspense from the main, make this one rather entertaining. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, several Sex Scenes and animal violence

Producer Frank Mancuso Jr. does a pretty good job here bestowing a generous budget for special effects(H. R. Giger designed the creature), the cast which includes heavyweights like Ben Kingley, Forrest Whitaker, Alfred Molina(SOOO young here) as well as always fun to watch Michael Madsen and beauties Marge Helgenberger, newcomer Natasha Henstridge and a very young Michelle Willimas, a decent script, very workmanlike directing from Roger Donaldson(who generally does a good job creating suspense and action). All of these add up for a roller-coaster THAT did keep me on the edge of my seat. I cared about the characters, the story was inventive, and the acting was very good for a vehicle like this. Are there some big holes in the script? You betcha! Are some of the lines and the ending in particular a bit troublesome to swallow? Yes, again, but I liked the movie nonetheless. Kinglsey is very good in his role as a bureaucrat. Whitaker excels as an empath. Henstridge is absolutely stunning and very fresh. This is your typical government makes-a-mistake-then-gathers-a-group-of-experts film, but one that I thought was very well done and highly entertaining.

    I'm almost ashamed to say that the exquisitely perfect body of a fairly often nude Natasha Henstridge is my main reason for enjoying 'Species'. Aside of that, the film now seems slightly laughable, the SFX elementary and Alfred Molina, plain awful. Forest Whittaker isn't much better and Michael Madsen just stupid. Ben Kingsley adds some credence as the ruthless scientist who has "developed" the little girl who then goes on to grow up into a sex hungry alien who only wants to reproduce her own 'Species' with the help of human sperm. It's a film that I can quarter watch, whilst doing something else. I don't take it seriously and there is little suspense and is certainly not in the league of 'Alien' and the like. I don't really like any of the sequels and wouldn't watch them again. Yes, 7/10 is probably way too generous, but we all have illogical reasoning when it comes to things we really like.

    After escaping from a government lab, a team is gathered to track down he half-human, half-alien being disguised as a beautiful woman as she leaves a blood-soaked trail of carnage looking to mate. This wasn't all that bad and certainly has a lot going for it. The action-movie focus during the latter half results in some fine moments, as they chase her around town leading to scenes like the freeway chase into the hillside or the spectacular series of stalking and shoot-outs in the underground caves at the finale, among other top choices. The underground scenes in particular are among the film's best parts, as the disorienting caves, dark pits and waterways provide some great locations to generate some amazing shootouts and spectacle amongst it all. Other big action scenes are spread throughout the film and really help mask the fact that this is slightly too long, it's only big flaw, since there's several subplots that last too long or don't need to be included at all. Fortunately, the marvelous special effects for the alien being, abundant gore in the graphic kills and copious nudity also manage to overcome the film's rather weak CGI for the finale, and with enough tension and suspense from the main, make this one rather entertaining. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, several Sex Scenes and animal violence

    A surprisingly strong cast of solid actors(past & future Academy Award winners Ben Kingsly & Forest Whitaker among them!), and a good director(Roger Donaldson) all involved in a trashy Sci-Fi story about an alien replicated from captured DNA in a secret government experiment, being pursued by a crack team of scientists and soldiers after she escapes, and wrecks havoc across the city as it becomes determined to reproduce its species on Earth, or die trying... Nothing new or original in this story at all, certainly not thought-provoking Science Fiction, but is slickly put together, though why such fuss was made about such low-rent material is unknown...

    This is a B Movie trapped in an A Production. It tries to break free of its Fancy-Pants foundation and succeeds with some Charm. There is a Name Cast here headlined by an Oscar Winner, Ben Kingsley giving what must be the worst Performance of his Career. The Scene in the Lab when the Scientist are trapped with the "New Alien" is downright deplorable and He and the Director should be ashamed. The Movie is a lot of Sci-Fi and Horror Movie Fun. The central theme here is Sex overlaid by all the Gore and expensive SFX and Action. It is a Sex Story (think Kinsey and Freud on Acid), and is the prime of this pump. The Sex is sexy, the Violence is violent, the Gore is gory, the Alien looks Alien, and the Script is, well that's the rub. The Dialog is sometimes so Corny, Clich&eacute;d, and Bad that one can only hope that it was an attempt at Cheap Laughs and aimed at less than the usual Cerebral Sci-Fi intellect. But who knows. Most of this isn't even as good as those "penny a word" Pulps. Overall this will not disappoint Fans of Fangoria and Cinefantastique and casual Folks slumming for a Thrill, but this isn't really anything more than an Entertaining Movie based on past expectations to do nothing more and nothing less at the Drive-In or a Saturday Matin&eacute;e.

    Somehow this knockabout trash about an escaped alien-human hybrid in search of a mate managed to avoid the straight-to-video pile despite being little more than an excuse for a few car chases and many sightings of Natasha Henstridge's knockers. In a stroke of luck, the first programmes Henstridge sees on TV once she's on the loose teach her how to use money and credit cards, drive, have sex, dye her hair and crash a car into a pylon, all of which come in handy as the plot unfolds. Meanwhile Ben Kingsley and Forest Whitaker take it all too seriously, Alfred Molina is funny on purpose, the score is atmospheric if reminiscent of 'Aliens' in places, and there's a nicely played romance between Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger. This is, of course, absolute rubbish, but there's a sense that the movie knows that and as a result it's all rather likable.

    This movie is B-Grade Sci-Fi with copious amounts of nudity on the part of Ms.Hestridge. Aliens send us a DNA code, and we combine it with human DNA and create a "Docile" female hybrid, who proceeds to fornicate and kill her way across Los Angeles. Unlike it's sloppy sequels, this movie is tight, the characters are well-written, and you get a sense of tension as Sil and her pursuers track each other. Sil is actually a sympathetic monster. She didn't ask to be created or programmed to destroy humanity. Most annoying character is Forrest Whitacker, who was barely following the "Don't go full" rule from "Tropic Thunder". He states things like "Captain Obvious".

    As this movie came to an end, Dr. Baker (Marg Helgenberger) asked a question that I thought was surprisingly thought provoking, given that the movie as a whole wasn't especially thought provoking. According to the story, several years before, SETI (The Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence) had received a signal from an alien civilization. They interpreted it as having been a friendly signal sent in response to signals from earth. The signal included an alien DNA code, in response to a human DNA code that had been sent into space. The scientists decided to implant the alien DNA into a human ovum to make an alien- human hybrid creature. OK. (I suppose the opening is thought provoking as well, in depicting this poor, human looking young girl locked in what was little more than a comfortable cage with little contact with anyone, but it was the ending quote I found most thought provoking - from Dr. Baker: "she was half us and half something else. I wonder what half was the predatory half?" Good question! (Maybe the aliens tried the same experiment with our DNA with equally disastrous results and were trying to get back at us!) You see, this hybrid was predatory. It was a killer. It grew rapidly, reached maturity quickly and had the desire to mate and reproduce and would do whatever it took to find the right partner. If that included killing, so be it. But, yeah, from what we were told, the aliens seemed friendly enough. So where did the predatory half come from? Us? Interesting, and thought-provoking enough that it actually made me raise my estimation of the movie just a bit. Having said, that, this is overall not a great movie. It has some moments. No doubt about that. Some of the animation - revolving around the alien in the underground caverns near the end of the movie - was pretty primitive looking, though. There was really no need for Dr. Baker and Preston (Michael Madsen) to get together romantically, and Forrest Whitaker's character of the empath Dan seemed really out of place. In fact, the movie seemed to reach its silliest pretty early on when Xavier (Ben Kingsley) gathered this team who had been brought together to search out and destroy the creature, looked at Preston (who was some sort of special ops/government hit man type) and said to him "as the non-scientist among us ..." "THE" non-scientist? Are we to infer that Xavier considered an empath to be a scientist? Pretty silly line. One line, yes, but it stuck in my head for some reason. Anyway. The cast here is a very interesting one. It ranges from the very well known and accomplished Ben Kingsley to the (at the time) unknown and not at all accomplished Natasha Henstridge, who has never really built a major acting career out of this beginning. She's quite beautiful, but she didn't really blow me away. (As an aside, when I lived for a few years in Newfoundland, I lived near her home town of Springdale and actually knew a couple of people who were related to her and some who knew her as a child when the family would return home to visit after moving away. I actually was living there when this movie was released, so it created quite a buzz that one of Newfoundland's own was starring in a movie!) Between Kingsley and Henstridge, there were other faces, some (like Whitaker or Alfred Molina) better known (to me anyway) than others (such as Madsen or Helgenberger.) So there was quite a range of talent and experience in this. Kingsley's character looked a bit silly in the end as he picked up the flame thrower to go after the creature. I still see him as Ghandi, I guess, and Ghandi with a flame thrower is not an image my brain can process easily! In fact, at various times scattered throughout this I picked up an almost tongue in cheek attitude in the movie. This isn't great but it also isn't really bad, and, yes, it does have its moments. (5/10)

    Well, I think we can all recall what makes an exploitation film and how it relates to this movie. Gratuitous sex and nudity-check, a plot so simplistic and yet so poorly executed-check, a monster so cheesy that you can't help but giggle at it's presence in what are supposed to be serious scenes-check! When I was viewing this film, I felt as if this was a rejected porno-parody from the 1970's. An alien monster that needs to breed so it goes around and tries to sleep with any guy that she can find. Surprisingly the film boasts an all-star cast. While they no doubt bring some pretty top notch acting, the story cannot be saved. On another note, this movie is a perfect example of how over-dependence on CGI will no doubt make your movie look positively stupid and silly in only a matter of 17 years. There are movies from the 1970s that have more convincing monsters than this one! With that I can only say that the movie is dumb, however if you want a good laugh and go in with the expectation that it's going to be nothing but a cheesy good time, then you may find some joy in this picture.

    This is not just a cheesier, trashier knockoff of the second Terminator with some Alien and nudity thrown in. It has something else going. You have four 'watchers', four pairs of eyes led by the scientific 'mastermind' of an experiment in engineering hybrid vision. One is an action nut, one is intuitive, the other two are analytical minds. All four watch and make guesses on the direction that the monster movie plot is taking. Instead of this enhancing the product, it only reveals limitations in the work. Each of the four is as broadly characterized as the rest. Each one is played by an actor who simply 'looks' the part - Madsen as the cocky bastard - and will need no substantial acting chops to pull it off - except the analyst woman, who is a nondescript blonde and only there it seems to show some skin. The movie does not transform as we switch to a different point-of-view of the hybrid vision. In spite of the movie's structure to the contrary, it has one fabric and it's squarely rooted in action dynamics. And you can see this carried over in the cinematic presentation of the monster, another aspect of engineered vision. Giger has come up with pretty cool tentacles and cocoon. But it's not half of it in shadows and half of it fused in the fabric and walls of the film, as in the first Alien. It is all of it in front of the camera. We see more, register less. There is a memorable dream scene. It is quite obviously separated from the 'reality' of the film - nothing here bleeds two ways, all the energy of watching goes to satisfy the desire to. It is fun to watch, as derivative and comfortable as a pair of slippers. And it is once again showcased in the film that Ben Kingsley is the most corny and ridiculous presence in movies. Still. I am tapping this for my cinematic Los Angeles project.

    I rather enjoyed this story about scientists taking the extra-terrestrial advice about reshaping DNA and then growing something from it only to have it escape, destroy, kill, kill, kill, kill, and have all the moral empathy of a rock. Producer Frank Mancuso Jr. does a pretty good job here bestowing a generous budget for special effects(H. R. Giger designed the creature), the cast which includes heavyweights like Ben Kingley, Forrest Whitaker, Alfred Molina(SOOO young here) as well as always fun to watch Michael Madsen and beauties Marge Helgenberger, newcomer Natasha Henstridge and a very young Michelle Willimas, a decent script, very workmanlike directing from Roger Donaldson(who generally does a good job creating suspense and action). All of these add up for a roller-coaster THAT did keep me on the edge of my seat. I cared about the characters, the story was inventive, and the acting was very good for a vehicle like this. Are there some big holes in the script? You betcha! Are some of the lines and the ending in particular a bit troublesome to swallow? Yes, again, but I liked the movie nonetheless. Kinglsey is very good in his role as a bureaucrat. Whitaker excels as an empath. Henstridge is absolutely stunning and very fresh. This is your typical government makes-a-mistake-then-gathers-a-group-of-experts film, but one that I thought was very well done and highly entertaining.

One is an action nut, one is intuitive, the other two are analytical minds. All four watch and make guesses on the direction that the monster movie plot is taking. Instead of this enhancing the product, it only reveals limitations in the work. Each of the four is as broadly characterized as the rest. Each one is played by an actor who simply 'looks' the part - Madsen as the cocky bastard - and will need no substantial acting chops to pull it off - except the analyst woman, who is a nondescript blonde and only there it seems to show some skin. The movie does not transform as we switch to a different point-of-view of the hybrid vision. In spite of the movie's structure to the contrary, it has one fabric and it's squarely rooted in action dynamics. And you can see this carried over in the cinematic presentation of the monster, another aspect of engineered vision. Giger has come up with pretty cool tentacles and cocoon. But it's not half of it in shadows and half of it fused in the fabric and walls of the film, as in the first Alien. It is all of it in front of the camera. We see more, register less. There is a memorable dream scene. It is quite obviously separated from the 'reality' of the film - nothing here bleeds two ways, all the energy of watching goes to satisfy the desire to. It is fun to watch, as derivative and comfortable as a pair of slippers. And it is once again showcased in the film that Ben Kingsley is the most corny and ridiculous presence in movies. Still. I am tapping this for my cinematic Los Angeles project.

    I rather enjoyed this story about scientists taking the extra-terrestrial advice about reshaping DNA and then growing something from it only to have it escape, destroy, kill, kill, kill, kill, and have all the moral empathy of a rock. Producer Frank Mancuso Jr. does a pretty good job here bestowing a generous budget for special effects(H. R. Giger designed the creature), the cast which includes heavyweights like Ben Kingley, Forrest Whitaker, Alfred Molina(SOOO young here) as well as always fun to watch Michael Madsen and beauties Marge Helgenberger, newcomer Natasha Henstridge and a very young Michelle Willimas, a decent script, very workmanlike directing from Roger Donaldson(who generally does a good job creating suspense and action). All of these add up for a roller-coaster THAT did keep me on the edge of my seat. I cared about the characters, the story was inventive, and the acting was very good for a vehicle like this. Are there some big holes in the script? You betcha! Are some of the lines and the ending in particular a bit troublesome to swallow? Yes, again, but I liked the movie nonetheless. Kinglsey is very good in his role as a bureaucrat. Whitaker excels as an empath. Henstridge is absolutely stunning and very fresh. This is your typical government makes-a-mistake-then-gathers-a-group-of-experts film, but one that I thought was very well done and highly entertaining.

    I'm almost ashamed to say that the exquisitely perfect body of a fairly often nude Natasha Henstridge is my main reason for enjoying 'Species'. Aside of that, the film now seems slightly laughable, the SFX elementary and Alfred Molina, plain awful. Forest Whittaker isn't much better and Michael Madsen just stupid. Ben Kingsley adds some credence as the ruthless scientist who has "developed" the little girl who then goes on to grow up into a sex hungry alien who only wants to reproduce her own 'Species' with the help of human sperm. It's a film that I can quarter watch, whilst doing something else. I don't take it seriously and there is little suspense and is certainly not in the league of 'Alien' and the like. I don't really like any of the sequels and wouldn't watch them again. Yes, 7/10 is probably way too generous, but we all have illogical reasoning when it comes to things we really like.

    After escaping from a government lab, a team is gathered to track down he half-human, half-alien being disguised as a beautiful woman as she leaves a blood-soaked trail of carnage looking to mate. This wasn't all that bad and certainly has a lot going for it. The action-movie focus during the latter half results in some fine moments, as they chase her around town leading to scenes like the freeway chase into the hillside or the spectacular series of stalking and shoot-outs in the underground caves at the finale, among other top choices. The underground scenes in particular are among the film's best parts, as the disorienting caves, dark pits and waterways provide some great locations to generate some amazing shootouts and spectacle amongst it all. Other big action scenes are spread throughout the film and really help mask the fact that this is slightly too long, it's only big flaw, since there's several subplots that last too long or don't need to be included at all. Fortunately, the marvelous special effects for the alien being, abundant gore in the graphic kills and copious nudity also manage to overcome the film's rather weak CGI for the finale, and with enough tension and suspense from the main, make this one rather entertaining. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, several Sex Scenes and animal violence

    A surprisingly strong cast of solid actors(past & future Academy Award winners Ben Kingsly & Forest Whitaker among them!), and a good director(Roger Donaldson) all involved in a trashy Sci-Fi story about an alien replicated from captured DNA in a secret government experiment, being pursued by a crack team of scientists and soldiers after she escapes, and wrecks havoc across the city as it becomes determined to reproduce its species on Earth, or die trying... Nothing new or original in this story at all, certainly not thought-provoking Science Fiction, but is slickly put together, though why such fuss was made about such low-rent material is unknown...

    This is a B Movie trapped in an A Production. It tries to break free of its Fancy-Pants foundation and succeeds with some Charm. There is a Name Cast here headlined by an Oscar Winner, Ben Kingsley giving what must be the worst Performance of his Career. The Scene in the Lab when the Scientist are trapped with the "New Alien" is downright deplorable and He and the Director should be ashamed. The Movie is a lot of Sci-Fi and Horror Movie Fun. The central theme here is Sex overlaid by all the Gore and expensive SFX and Action. It is a Sex Story (think Kinsey and Freud on Acid), and is the prime of this pump. The Sex is sexy, the Violence is violent, the Gore is gory, the Alien looks Alien, and the Script is, well that's the rub. The Dialog is sometimes so Corny, Clich&eacute;d, and Bad that one can only hope that it was an attempt at Cheap Laughs and aimed at less than the usual Cerebral Sci-Fi intellect. But who knows. Most of this isn't even as good as those "penny a word" Pulps. Overall this will not disappoint Fans of Fangoria and Cinefantastique and casual Folks slumming for a Thrill, but this isn't really anything more than an Entertaining Movie based on past expectations to do nothing more and nothing less at the Drive-In or a Saturday Matin&eacute;e.

    Somehow this knockabout trash about an escaped alien-human hybrid in search of a mate managed to avoid the straight-to-video pile despite being little more than an excuse for a few car chases and many sightings of Natasha Henstridge's knockers. In a stroke of luck, the first programmes Henstridge sees on TV once she's on the loose teach her how to use money and credit cards, drive, have sex, dye her hair and crash a car into a pylon, all of which come in handy as the plot unfolds. Meanwhile Ben Kingsley and Forest Whitaker take it all too seriously, Alfred Molina is funny on purpose, the score is atmospheric if reminiscent of 'Aliens' in places, and there's a nicely played romance between Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger. This is, of course, absolute rubbish, but there's a sense that the movie knows that and as a result it's all rather likable.

    This movie is B-Grade Sci-Fi with copious amounts of nudity on the part of Ms.Hestridge. Aliens send us a DNA code, and we combine it with human DNA and create a "Docile" female hybrid, who proceeds to fornicate and kill her way across Los Angeles. Unlike it's sloppy sequels, this movie is tight, the characters are well-written, and you get a sense of tension as Sil and her pursuers track each other. Sil is actually a sympathetic monster. She didn't ask to be created or programmed to destroy humanity. Most annoying character is Forrest Whitacker, who was barely following the "Don't go full" rule from "Tropic Thunder". He states things like "Captain Obvious".

    As this movie came to an end, Dr. Baker (Marg Helgenberger) asked a question that I thought was surprisingly thought provoking, given that the movie as a whole wasn't especially thought provoking. According to the story, several years before, SETI (The Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence) had received a signal from an alien civilization. They interpreted it as having been a friendly signal sent in response to signals from earth. The signal included an alien DNA code, in response to a human DNA code that had been sent into space. The scientists decided to implant the alien DNA into a human ovum to make an alien- human hybrid creature. OK. (I suppose the opening is thought provoking as well, in depicting this poor, human looking young girl locked in what was little more than a comfortable cage with little contact with anyone, but it was the ending quote I found most thought provoking - from Dr. Baker: "she was half us and half something else. I wonder what half was the predatory half?" Good question! (Maybe the aliens tried the same experiment with our DNA with equally disastrous results and were trying to get back at us!) You see, this hybrid was predatory. It was a killer. It grew rapidly, reached maturity quickly and had the desire to mate and reproduce and would do whatever it took to find the right partner. If that included killing, so be it. But, yeah, from what we were told, the aliens seemed friendly enough. So where did the predatory half come from? Us? Interesting, and thought-provoking enough that it actually made me raise my estimation of the movie just a bit. Having said, that, this is overall not a great movie. It has some moments. No doubt about that. Some of the animation - revolving around the alien in the underground caverns near the end of the movie - was pretty primitive looking, though. There was really no need for Dr. Baker and Preston (Michael Madsen) to get together romantically, and Forrest Whitaker's character of the empath Dan seemed really out of place. In fact, the movie seemed to reach its silliest pretty early on when Xavier (Ben Kingsley) gathered this team who had been brought together to search out and destroy the creature, looked at Preston (who was some sort of special ops/government hit man type) and said to him "as the non-scientist among us ..." "THE" non-scientist? Are we to infer that Xavier considered an empath to be a scientist? Pretty silly line. One line, yes, but it stuck in my head for some reason. Anyway. The cast here is a very interesting one. It ranges from the very well known and accomplished Ben Kingsley to the (at the time) unknown and not at all accomplished Natasha Henstridge, who has never really built a major acting career out of this beginning. She's quite beautiful, but she didn't really blow me away. (As an aside, when I lived for a few years in Newfoundland, I lived near her home town of Springdale and actually knew a couple of people who were related to her and some who knew her as a child when the family would return home to visit after moving away. I actually was living there when this movie was released, so it created quite a buzz that one of Newfoundland's own was starring in a movie!) Between Kingsley and Henstridge, there were other faces, some (like Whitaker or Alfred Molina) better known (to me anyway) than others (such as Madsen or Helgenberger.) So there was quite a range of talent and experience in this. Kingsley's character looked a bit silly in the end as he picked up the flame thrower to go after the creature. I still see him as Ghandi, I guess, and Ghandi with a flame thrower is not an image my brain can process easily! In fact, at various times scattered throughout this I picked up an almost tongue in cheek attitude in the movie. This isn't great but it also isn't really bad, and, yes, it does have its moments. (5/10)

    Well, I think we can all recall what makes an exploitation film and how it relates to this movie. Gratuitous sex and nudity-check, a plot so simplistic and yet so poorly executed-check, a monster so cheesy that you can't help but giggle at it's presence in what are supposed to be serious scenes-check! When I was viewing this film, I felt as if this was a rejected porno-parody from the 1970's. An alien monster that needs to breed so it goes around and tries to sleep with any guy that she can find. Surprisingly the film boasts an all-star cast. While they no doubt bring some pretty top notch acting, the story cannot be saved. On another note, this movie is a perfect example of how over-dependence on CGI will no doubt make your movie look positively stupid and silly in only a matter of 17 years. There are movies from the 1970s that have more convincing monsters than this one! With that I can only say that the movie is dumb, however if you want a good laugh and go in with the expectation that it's going to be nothing but a cheesy good time, then you may find some joy in this picture.

    This is not just a cheesier, trashier knockoff of the second Terminator with some Alien and nudity thrown in. It has something else going. You have four 'watchers', four pairs of eyes led by the scientific 'mastermind' of an experiment in engineering hybrid vision. One is an action nut, one is intuitive, the other two are analytical minds. All four watch and make guesses on the direction that the monster movie plot is taking. Instead of this enhancing the product, it only reveals limitations in the work. Each of the four is as broadly characterized as the rest. Each one is played by an actor who simply 'looks' the part - Madsen as the cocky bastard - and will need no substantial acting chops to pull it off - except the analyst woman, who is a nondescript blonde and only there it seems to show some skin. The movie does not transform as we switch to a different point-of-view of the hybrid vision. In spite of the movie's structure to the contrary, it has one fabric and it's squarely rooted in action dynamics. And you can see this carried over in the cinematic presentation of the monster, another aspect of engineered vision. Giger has come up with pretty cool tentacles and cocoon. But it's not half of it in shadows and half of it fused in the fabric and walls of the film, as in the first Alien. It is all of it in front of the camera. We see more, register less. There is a memorable dream scene. It is quite obviously separated from the 'reality' of the film - nothing here bleeds two ways, all the energy of watching goes to satisfy the desire to. It is fun to watch, as derivative and comfortable as a pair of slippers. And it is once again showcased in the film that Ben Kingsley is the most corny and ridiculous presence in movies. Still. I am tapping this for my cinematic Los Angeles project.

    Well, I think we can all recall what makes an exploitation film and how it relates to this movie. Gratuitous sex and nudity-check, a plot so simplistic and yet so poorly executed-check, a monster so cheesy that you can't help but giggle at it's presence in what are supposed to be serious scenes-check! When I was viewing this film, I felt as if this was a rejected porno-parody from the 1970's. An alien monster that needs to breed so it goes around and tries to sleep with any guy that she can find. Surprisingly the film boasts an all-star cast. While they no doubt bring some pretty top notch acting, the story cannot be saved. On another note, this movie is a perfect example of how over-dependence on CGI will no doubt make your movie look positively stupid and silly in only a matter of 17 years. There are movies from the 1970s that have more convincing monsters than this one! With that I can only say that the movie is dumb, however if you want a good laugh and go in with the expectation that it's going to be nothing but a cheesy good time, then you may find some joy in this picture.

    This is not just a cheesier, trashier knockoff of the second Terminator with some Alien and nudity thrown in. It has something else going. You have four 'watchers', four pairs of eyes led by the scientific 'mastermind' of an experiment in engineering hybrid vision. One is an action nut, one is intuitive, the other two are analytical minds. All four watch and make guesses on the direction that the monster movie plot is taking. Instead of this enhancing the product, it only reveals limitations in the work. Each of the four is as broadly characterized as the rest. Each one is played by an actor who simply 'looks' the part - Madsen as the cocky bastard - and will need no substantial acting chops to pull it off - except the analyst woman, who is a nondescript blonde and only there it seems to show some skin. The movie does not transform as we switch to a different point-of-view of the hybrid vision. In spite of the movie's structure to the contrary, it has one fabric and it's squarely rooted in action dynamics. And you can see this carried over in the cinematic presentation of the monster, another aspect of engineered vision. Giger has come up with pretty cool tentacles and cocoon. But it's not half of it in shadows and half of it fused in the fabric and walls of the film, as in the first Alien. It is all of it in front of the camera. We see more, register less. There is a memorable dream scene. It is quite obviously separated from the 'reality' of the film - nothing here bleeds two ways, all the energy of watching goes to satisfy the desire to. It is fun to watch, as derivative and comfortable as a pair of slippers. And it is once again showcased in the film that Ben Kingsley is the most corny and ridiculous presence in movies. Still. I am tapping this for my cinematic Los Angeles project.

    I rather enjoyed this story about scientists taking the extra-terrestrial advice about reshaping DNA and then growing something from it only to have it escape, destroy, kill, kill, kill, kill, and have all the moral empathy of a rock. Producer Frank Mancuso Jr. does a pretty good job here bestowing a generous budget for special effects(H. R. Giger designed the creature), the cast which includes heavyweights like Ben Kingley, Forrest Whitaker, Alfred Molina(SOOO young here) as well as always fun to watch Michael Madsen and beauties Marge Helgenberger, newcomer Natasha Henstridge and a very young Michelle Willimas, a decent script, very workmanlike directing from Roger Donaldson(who generally does a good job creating suspense and action). All of these add up for a roller-coaster THAT did keep me on the edge of my seat. I cared about the characters, the story was inventive, and the acting was very good for a vehicle like this. Are there some big holes in the script? You betcha! Are some of the lines and the ending in particular a bit troublesome to swallow? Yes, again, but I liked the movie nonetheless. Kinglsey is very good in his role as a bureaucrat. Whitaker excels as an empath. Henstridge is absolutely stunning and very fresh. This is your typical government makes-a-mistake-then-gathers-a-group-of-experts film, but one that I thought was very well done and highly entertaining.

    I'm almost ashamed to say that the exquisitely perfect body of a fairly often nude Natasha Henstridge is my main reason for enjoying 'Species'. Aside of that, the film now seems slightly laughable, the SFX elementary and Alfred Molina, plain awful. Forest Whittaker isn't much better and Michael Madsen just stupid. Ben Kingsley adds some credence as the ruthless scientist who has "developed" the little girl who then goes on to grow up into a sex hungry alien who only wants to reproduce her own 'Species' with the help of human sperm. It's a film that I can quarter watch, whilst doing something else. I don't take it seriously and there is little suspense and is certainly not in the league of 'Alien' and the like. I don't really like any of the sequels and wouldn't watch them again. Yes, 7/10 is probably way too generous, but we all have illogical reasoning when it comes to things we really like.

    After escaping from a government lab, a team is gathered to track down he half-human, half-alien being disguised as a beautiful woman as she leaves a blood-soaked trail of carnage looking to mate. This wasn't all that bad and certainly has a lot going for it. The action-movie focus during the latter half results in some fine moments, as they chase her around town leading to scenes like the freeway chase into the hillside or the spectacular series of stalking and shoot-outs in the underground caves at the finale, among other top choices. The underground scenes in particular are among the film's best parts, as the disorienting caves, dark pits and waterways provide some great locations to generate some amazing shootouts and spectacle amongst it all. Other big action scenes are spread throughout the film and really help mask the fact that this is slightly too long, it's only big flaw, since there's several subplots that last too long or don't need to be included at all. Fortunately, the marvelous special effects for the alien being, abundant gore in the graphic kills and copious nudity also manage to overcome the film's rather weak CGI for the finale, and with enough tension and suspense from the main, make this one rather entertaining. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, several Sex Scenes and animal violence

    A surprisingly strong cast of solid actors(past & future Academy Award winners Ben Kingsly & Forest Whitaker among them!), and a good director(Roger Donaldson) all involved in a trashy Sci-Fi story about an alien replicated from captured DNA in a secret government experiment, being pursued by a crack team of scientists and soldiers after she escapes, and wrecks havoc across the city as it becomes determined to reproduce its species on Earth, or die trying... Nothing new or original in this story at all, certainly not thought-provoking Science Fiction, but is slickly put together, though why such fuss was made about such low-rent material is unknown...

    This is a B Movie trapped in an A Production. It tries to break free of its Fancy-Pants foundation and succeeds with some Charm. There is a Name Cast here headlined by an Oscar Winner, Ben Kingsley giving what must be the worst Performance of his Career. The Scene in the Lab when the Scientist are trapped with the "New Alien" is downright deplorable and He and the Director should be ashamed. The Movie is a lot of Sci-Fi and Horror Movie Fun. The central theme here is Sex overlaid by all the Gore and expensive SFX and Action. It is a Sex Story (think Kinsey and Freud on Acid), and is the prime of this pump. The Sex is sexy, the Violence is violent, the Gore is gory, the Alien looks Alien, and the Script is, well that's the rub. The Dialog is sometimes so Corny, Clich&eacute;d, and Bad that one can only hope that it was an attempt at Cheap Laughs and aimed at less than the usual Cerebral Sci-Fi intellect. But who knows. Most of this isn't even as good as those "penny a word" Pulps. Overall this will not disappoint Fans of Fangoria and Cinefantastique and casual Folks slumming for a Thrill, but this isn't really anything more than an Entertaining Movie based on past expectations to do nothing more and nothing less at the Drive-In or a Saturday Matin&eacute;e.

    Somehow this knockabout trash about an escaped alien-human hybrid in search of a mate managed to avoid the straight-to-video pile despite being little more than an excuse for a few car chases and many sightings of Natasha Henstridge's knockers. In a stroke of luck, the first programmes Henstridge sees on TV once she's on the loose teach her how to use money and credit cards, drive, have sex, dye her hair and crash a car into a pylon, all of which come in handy as the plot unfolds. Meanwhile Ben Kingsley and Forest Whitaker take it all too seriously, Alfred Molina is funny on purpose, the score is atmospheric if reminiscent of 'Aliens' in places, and there's a nicely played romance between Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger. This is, of course, absolute rubbish, but there's a sense that the movie knows that and as a result it's all rather likable.

    This movie is B-Grade Sci-Fi with copious amounts of nudity on the part of Ms.Hestridge. Aliens send us a DNA code, and we combine it with human DNA and create a "Docile" female hybrid, who proceeds to fornicate and kill her way across Los Angeles. Unlike it's sloppy sequels, this movie is tight, the characters are well-written, and you get a sense of tension as Sil and her pursuers track each other. Sil is actually a sympathetic monster. She didn't ask to be created or programmed to destroy humanity. Most annoying character is Forrest Whitacker, who was barely following the "Don't go full" rule from "Tropic Thunder". He states things like "Captain Obvious".

    As this movie came to an end, Dr. Baker (Marg Helgenberger) asked a question that I thought was surprisingly thought provoking, given that the movie as a whole wasn't especially thought provoking. According to the story, several years before, SETI (The Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence) had received a signal from an alien civilization. They interpreted it as having been a friendly signal sent in response to signals from earth. The signal included an alien DNA code, in response to a human DNA code that had been sent into space. The scientists decided to implant the alien DNA into a human ovum to make an alien- human hybrid creature. OK. (I suppose the opening is thought provoking as well, in depicting this poor, human looking young girl locked in what was little more than a comfortable cage with little contact with anyone, but it was the ending quote I found most thought provoking - from Dr. Baker: "she was half us and half something else. I wonder what half was the predatory half?" Good question! (Maybe the aliens tried the same experiment with our DNA with equally disastrous results and were trying to get back at us!) You see, this hybrid was predatory. It was a killer. It grew rapidly, reached maturity quickly and had the desire to mate and reproduce and would do whatever it took to find the right partner. If that included killing, so be it. But, yeah, from what we were told, the aliens seemed friendly enough. So where did the predatory half come from? Us? Interesting, and thought-provoking enough that it actually made me raise my estimation of the movie just a bit. Having said, that, this is overall not a great movie. It has some moments. No doubt about that. Some of the animation - revolving around the alien in the underground caverns near the end of the movie - was pretty primitive looking, though. There was really no need for Dr. Baker and Preston (Michael Madsen) to get together romantically, and Forrest Whitaker's character of the empath Dan seemed really out of place. In fact, the movie seemed to reach its silliest pretty early on when Xavier (Ben Kingsley) gathered this team who had been brought together to search out and destroy the creature, looked at Preston (who was some sort of special ops/government hit man type) and said to him "as the non-scientist among us ..." "THE" non-scientist? Are we to infer that Xavier considered an empath to be a scientist? Pretty silly line. One line, yes, but it stuck in my head for some reason. Anyway. The cast here is a very interesting one. It ranges from the very well known and accomplished Ben Kingsley to the (at the time) unknown and not at all accomplished Natasha Henstridge, who has never really built a major acting career out of this beginning. She's quite beautiful, but she didn't really blow me away. (As an aside, when I lived for a few years in Newfoundland, I lived near her home town of Springdale and actually knew a couple of people who were related to her and some who knew her as a child when the family would return home to visit after moving away. I actually was living there when this movie was released, so it created quite a buzz that one of Newfoundland's own was starring in a movie!) Between Kingsley and Henstridge, there were other faces, some (like Whitaker or Alfred Molina) better known (to me anyway) than others (such as Madsen or Helgenberger.) So there was quite a range of talent and experience in this. Kingsley's character looked a bit silly in the end as he picked up the flame thrower to go after the creature. I still see him as Ghandi, I guess, and Ghandi with a flame thrower is not an image my brain can process easily! In fact, at various times scattered throughout this I picked up an almost tongue in cheek attitude in the movie. This isn't great but it also isn't really bad, and, yes, it does have its moments. (5/10)

    Well, I think we can all recall what makes an exploitation film and how it relates to this movie.

You have four 'watchers', four pairs of eyes led by the scientific 'mastermind' of an experiment in engineering hybrid vision. One is an action nut, one is intuitive, the other two are analytical minds. All four watch and make guesses on the direction that the monster movie plot is taking. Instead of this enhancing the product, it only reveals limitations in the work. Each of the four is as broadly characterized as the rest. Each one is played by an actor who simply 'looks' the part - Madsen as the cocky bastard - and will need no substantial acting chops to pull it off - except the analyst woman, who is a nondescript blonde and only there it seems to show some skin. The movie does not transform as we switch to a different point-of-view of the hybrid vision. In spite of the movie's structure to the contrary, it has one fabric and it's squarely rooted in action dynamics. And you can see this carried over in the cinematic presentation of the monster, another aspect of engineered vision. Giger has come up with pretty cool tentacles and cocoon. But it's not half of it in shadows and half of it fused in the fabric and walls of the film, as in the first Alien. It is all of it in front of the camera. We see more, register less.

In fact, the movie seemed to reach its silliest pretty early on when Xavier (Ben Kingsley) gathered this team who had been brought together to search out and destroy the creature, looked at Preston (who was some sort of special ops/government hit man type) and said to him "as the non-scientist among us ..." "THE" non-scientist? Are we to infer that Xavier considered an empath to be a scientist? Pretty silly line. One line, yes, but it stuck in my head for some reason. Anyway. The cast here is a very interesting one. It ranges from the very well known and accomplished Ben Kingsley to the (at the time) unknown and not at all accomplished Natasha Henstridge, who has never really built a major acting career out of this beginning. She's quite beautiful, but she didn't really blow me away. (As an aside, when I lived for a few years in Newfoundland, I lived near her home town of Springdale and actually knew a couple of people who were related to her and some who knew her as a child when the family would return home to visit after moving away. I actually was living there when this movie was released, so it created quite a buzz that one of Newfoundland's own was starring in a movie!) Between Kingsley and Henstridge, there were other faces, some (like Whitaker or Alfred Molina) better known (to me anyway) than others (such as Madsen or Helgenberger.) So there was quite a range of talent and experience in this. Kingsley's character looked a bit silly in the end as he picked up the flame thrower to go after the creature. I still see him as Ghandi, I guess, and Ghandi with a flame thrower is not an image my brain can process easily! In fact, at various times scattered throughout this I picked up an almost tongue in cheek attitude in the movie. This isn't great but it also isn't really bad, and, yes, it does have its moments. (5/10)

    Well, I think we can all recall what makes an exploitation film and how it relates to this movie. Gratuitous sex and nudity-check, a plot so simplistic and yet so poorly executed-check, a monster so cheesy that you can't help but giggle at it's presence in what are supposed to be serious scenes-check! When I was viewing this film, I felt as if this was a rejected porno-parody from the 1970's. An alien monster that needs to breed so it goes around and tries to sleep with any guy that she can find. Surprisingly the film boasts an all-star cast. While they no doubt bring some pretty top notch acting, the story cannot be saved. On another note, this movie is a perfect example of how over-dependence on CGI will no doubt make your movie look positively stupid and silly in only a matter of 17 years. There are movies from the 1970s that have more convincing monsters than this one! With that I can only say that the movie is dumb, however if you want a good laugh and go in with the expectation that it's going to be nothing but a cheesy good time, then you may find some joy in this picture.

    This is not just a cheesier, trashier knockoff of the second Terminator with some Alien and nudity thrown in. It has something else going. You have four 'watchers', four pairs of eyes led by the scientific 'mastermind' of an experiment in engineering hybrid vision. One is an action nut, one is intuitive, the other two are analytical minds. All four watch and make guesses on the direction that the monster movie plot is taking. Instead of this enhancing the product, it only reveals limitations in the work. Each of the four is as broadly characterized as the rest. Each one is played by an actor who simply 'looks' the part - Madsen as the cocky bastard - and will need no substantial acting chops to pull it off - except the analyst woman, who is a nondescript blonde and only there it seems to show some skin. The movie does not transform as we switch to a different point-of-view of the hybrid vision. In spite of the movie's structure to the contrary, it has one fabric and it's squarely rooted in action dynamics. And you can see this carried over in the cinematic presentation of the monster, another aspect of engineered vision. Giger has come up with pretty cool tentacles and cocoon. But it's not half of it in shadows and half of it fused in the fabric and walls of the film, as in the first Alien. It is all of it in front of the camera. We see more, register less. There is a memorable dream scene. It is quite obviously separated from the 'reality' of the film - nothing here bleeds two ways, all the energy of watching goes to satisfy the desire to. It is fun to watch, as derivative and comfortable as a pair of slippers. And it is once again showcased in the film that Ben Kingsley is the most corny and ridiculous presence in movies. Still. I am tapping this for my cinematic Los Angeles project.

    I rather enjoyed this story about scientists taking the extra-terrestrial advice about reshaping DNA and then growing something from it only to have it escape, destroy, kill, kill, kill, kill, and have all the moral empathy of a rock. Producer Frank Mancuso Jr. does a pretty good job here bestowing a generous budget for special effects(H. R. Giger designed the creature), the cast which includes heavyweights like Ben Kingley, Forrest Whitaker, Alfred Molina(SOOO young here) as well as always fun to watch Michael Madsen and beauties Marge Helgenberger, newcomer Natasha Henstridge and a very young Michelle Willimas, a decent script, very workmanlike directing from Roger Donaldson(who generally does a good job creating suspense and action). All of these add up for a roller-coaster THAT did keep me on the edge of my seat. I cared about the characters, the story was inventive, and the acting was very good for a vehicle like this. Are there some big holes in the script? You betcha! Are some of the lines and the ending in particular a bit troublesome to swallow? Yes, again, but I liked the movie nonetheless. Kinglsey is very good in his role as a bureaucrat. Whitaker excels as an empath. Henstridge is absolutely stunning and very fresh. This is your typical government makes-a-mistake-then-gathers-a-group-of-experts film, but one that I thought was very well done and highly entertaining.

    I'm almost ashamed to say that the exquisitely perfect body of a fairly often nude Natasha Henstridge is my main reason for enjoying 'Species'. Aside of that, the film now seems slightly laughable, the SFX elementary and Alfred Molina, plain awful. Forest Whittaker isn't much better and Michael Madsen just stupid. Ben Kingsley adds some credence as the ruthless scientist who has "developed" the little girl who then goes on to grow up into a sex hungry alien who only wants to reproduce her own 'Species' with the help of human sperm. It's a film that I can quarter watch, whilst doing something else. I don't take it seriously and there is little suspense and is certainly not in the league of 'Alien' and the like. I don't really like any of the sequels and wouldn't watch them again. Yes, 7/10 is probably way too generous, but we all have illogical reasoning when it comes to things we really like.

    After escaping from a government lab, a team is gathered to track down he half-human, half-alien being disguised as a beautiful woman as she leaves a blood-soaked trail of carnage looking to mate. This wasn't all that bad and certainly has a lot going for it. The action-movie focus during the latter half results in some fine moments, as they chase her around town leading to scenes like the freeway chase into the hillside or the spectacular series of stalking and shoot-outs in the underground caves at the finale, among other top choices. The underground scenes in particular are among the film's best parts, as the disorienting caves, dark pits and waterways provide some great locations to generate some amazing shootouts and spectacle amongst it all. Other big action scenes are spread throughout the film and really help mask the fact that this is slightly too long, it's only big flaw, since there's several subplots that last too long or don't need to be included at all. Fortunately, the marvelous special effects for the alien being, abundant gore in the graphic kills and copious nudity also manage to overcome the film's rather weak CGI for the finale, and with enough tension and suspense from the main, make this one rather entertaining. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, several Sex Scenes and animal violence

    A surprisingly strong cast of solid actors(past & future Academy Award winners Ben Kingsly & Forest Whitaker among them!), and a good director(Roger Donaldson) all involved in a trashy Sci-Fi story about an alien replicated from captured DNA in a secret government experiment, being pursued by a crack team of scientists and soldiers after she escapes, and wrecks havoc across the city as it becomes determined to reproduce its species on Earth, or die trying... Nothing new or original in this story at all, certainly not thought-provoking Science Fiction, but is slickly put together, though why such fuss was made about such low-rent material is unknown...

    Somehow this knockabout trash about an escaped alien-human hybrid in search of a mate managed to avoid the straight-to-video pile despite being little more than an excuse for a few car chases and many sightings of Natasha Henstridge's knockers. In a stroke of luck, the first programmes Henstridge sees on TV once she's on the loose teach her how to use money and credit cards, drive, have sex, dye her hair and crash a car into a pylon, all of which come in handy as the plot unfolds. Meanwhile Ben Kingsley and Forest Whitaker take it all too seriously, Alfred Molina is funny on purpose, the score is atmospheric if reminiscent of 'Aliens' in places, and there's a nicely played romance between Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger. This is, of course, absolute rubbish, but there's a sense that the movie knows that and as a result it's all rather likable.

    This movie is B-Grade Sci-Fi with copious amounts of nudity on the part of Ms.Hestridge. Aliens send us a DNA code, and we combine it with human DNA and create a "Docile" female hybrid, who proceeds to fornicate and kill her way across Los Angeles. Unlike it's sloppy sequels, this movie is tight, the characters are well-written, and you get a sense of tension as Sil and her pursuers track each other. Sil is actually a sympathetic monster. She didn't ask to be created or programmed to destroy humanity. Most annoying character is Forrest Whitacker, who was barely following the "Don't go full" rule from "Tropic Thunder". He states things like "Captain Obvious".

    As this movie came to an end, Dr. Baker (Marg Helgenberger) asked a question that I thought was surprisingly thought provoking, given that the movie as a whole wasn't especially thought provoking. According to the story, several years before, SETI (The Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence) had received a signal from an alien civilization. They interpreted it as having been a friendly signal sent in response to signals from earth. The signal included an alien DNA code, in response to a human DNA code that had been sent into space. The scientists decided to implant the alien DNA into a human ovum to make an alien- human hybrid creature. OK. (I suppose the opening is thought provoking as well, in depicting this poor, human looking young girl locked in what was little more than a comfortable cage with little contact with anyone, but it was the ending quote I found most thought provoking - from Dr. Baker: "she was half us and half something else. I wonder what half was the predatory half?" Good question! (Maybe the aliens tried the same experiment with our DNA with equally disastrous results and were trying to get back at us!) You see, this hybrid was predatory. It was a killer. It grew rapidly, reached maturity quickly and had the desire to mate and reproduce and would do whatever it took to find the right partner. If that included killing, so be it. But, yeah, from what we were told, the aliens seemed friendly enough. So where did the predatory half come from? Us? Interesting, and thought-provoking enough that it actually made me raise my estimation of the movie just a bit. Having said, that, this is overall not a great movie. It has some moments. No doubt about that. Some of the animation - revolving around the alien in the underground caverns near the end of the movie - was pretty primitive looking, though. There was really no need for Dr. Baker and Preston (Michael Madsen) to get together romantically, and Forrest Whitaker's character of the empath Dan seemed really out of place. In fact, the movie seemed to reach its silliest pretty early on when Xavier (Ben Kingsley) gathered this team who had been brought together to search out and destroy the creature, looked at Preston (who was some sort of special ops/government hit man type) and said to him "as the non-scientist among us ..." "THE" non-scientist? Are we to infer that Xavier considered an empath to be a scientist? Pretty silly line. One line, yes, but it stuck in my head for some reason. Anyway. The cast here is a very interesting one. It ranges from the very well known and accomplished Ben Kingsley to the (at the time) unknown and not at all accomplished Natasha Henstridge, who has never really built a major acting career out of this beginning. She's quite beautiful, but she didn't really blow me away. (As an aside, when I lived for a few years in Newfoundland, I lived near her home town of Springdale and actually knew a couple of people who were related to her and some who knew her as a child when the family would return home to visit after moving away. I actually was living there when this movie was released, so it created quite a buzz that one of Newfoundland's own was starring in a movie!) Between Kingsley and Henstridge, there were other faces, some (like Whitaker or Alfred Molina) better known (to me anyway) than others (such as Madsen or Helgenberger.) So there was quite a range of talent and experience in this. Kingsley's character looked a bit silly in the end as he picked up the flame thrower to go after the creature. I still see him as Ghandi, I guess, and Ghandi with a flame thrower is not an image my brain can process easily! In fact, at various times scattered throughout this I picked up an almost tongue in cheek attitude in the movie. This isn't great but it also isn't really bad, and, yes, it does have its moments.

    As this movie came to an end, Dr. Baker (Marg Helgenberger) asked a question that I thought was surprisingly thought provoking, given that the movie as a whole wasn't especially thought provoking. According to the story, several years before, SETI (The Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence) had received a signal from an alien civilization. They interpreted it as having been a friendly signal sent in response to signals from earth. The signal included an alien DNA code, in response to a human DNA code that had been sent into space. The scientists decided to implant the alien DNA into a human ovum to make an alien- human hybrid creature. OK. (I suppose the opening is thought provoking as well, in depicting this poor, human looking young girl locked in what was little more than a comfortable cage with little contact with anyone, but it was the ending quote I found most thought provoking - from Dr. Baker: "she was half us and half something else. I wonder what half was the predatory half?" Good question! (Maybe the aliens tried the same experiment with our DNA with equally disastrous results and were trying to get back at us!) You see, this hybrid was predatory. It was a killer. It grew rapidly, reached maturity quickly and had the desire to mate and reproduce and would do whatever it took to find the right partner. If that included killing, so be it. But, yeah, from what we were told, the aliens seemed friendly enough. So where did the predatory half come from? Us? Interesting, and thought-provoking enough that it actually made me raise my estimation of the movie just a bit. Having said, that, this is overall not a great movie. It has some moments. No doubt about that. Some of the animation - revolving around the alien in the underground caverns near the end of the movie - was pretty primitive looking, though. There was really no need for Dr. Baker and Preston (Michael Madsen) to get together romantically, and Forrest Whitaker's character of the empath Dan seemed really out of place. In fact, the movie seemed to reach its silliest pretty early on when Xavier (Ben Kingsley) gathered this team who had been brought together to search out and destroy the creature, looked at Preston (who was some sort of special ops/government hit man type) and said to him "as the non-scientist among us ..." "THE" non-scientist? Are we to infer that Xavier considered an empath to be a scientist? Pretty silly line. One line, yes, but it stuck in my head for some reason. Anyway. The cast here is a very interesting one. It ranges from the very well known and accomplished Ben Kingsley to the (at the time) unknown and not at all accomplished Natasha Henstridge, who has never really built a major acting career out of this beginning. She's quite beautiful, but she didn't really blow me away. (As an aside, when I lived for a few years in Newfoundland, I lived near her home town of Springdale and actually knew a couple of people who were related to her and some who knew her as a child when the family would return home to visit after moving away. I actually was living there when this movie was released, so it created quite a buzz that one of Newfoundland's own was starring in a movie!) Between Kingsley and Henstridge, there were other faces, some (like Whitaker or Alfred Molina) better known (to me anyway) than others (such as Madsen or Helgenberger.) So there was quite a range of talent and experience in this. Kingsley's character looked a bit silly in the end as he picked up the flame thrower to go after the creature. I still see him as Ghandi, I guess, and Ghandi with a flame thrower is not an image my brain can process easily! In fact, at various times scattered throughout this I picked up an almost tongue in cheek attitude in the movie. This isn't great but it also isn't really bad, and, yes, it does have its moments. (5/10)

    Well, I think we can all recall what makes an exploitation film and how it relates to this movie. Gratuitous sex and nudity-check, a plot so simplistic and yet so poorly executed-check, a monster so cheesy that you can't help but giggle at it's presence in what are supposed to be serious scenes-check! When I was viewing this film, I felt as if this was a rejected porno-parody from the 1970's. An alien monster that needs to breed so it goes around and tries to sleep with any guy that she can find. Surprisingly the film boasts an all-star cast. While they no doubt bring some pretty top notch acting, the story cannot be saved. On another note, this movie is a perfect example of how over-dependence on CGI will no doubt make your movie look positively stupid and silly in only a matter of 17 years. There are movies from the 1970s that have more convincing monsters than this one! With that I can only say that the movie is dumb, however if you want a good laugh and go in with the expectation that it's going to be nothing but a cheesy good time, then you may find some joy in this picture.

    This is not just a cheesier, trashier knockoff of the second Terminator with some Alien and nudity thrown in. It has something else going. You have four 'watchers', four pairs of eyes led by the scientific 'mastermind' of an experiment in engineering hybrid vision. One is an action nut, one is intuitive, the other two are analytical minds. All four watch and make guesses on the direction that the monster movie plot is taking. Instead of this enhancing the product, it only reveals limitations in the work. Each of the four is as broadly characterized as the rest. Each one is played by an actor who simply 'looks' the part - Madsen as the cocky bastard - and will need no substantial acting chops to pull it off - except the analyst woman, who is a nondescript blonde and only there it seems to show some skin. The movie does not transform as we switch to a different point-of-view of the hybrid vision. In spite of the movie's structure to the contrary, it has one fabric and it's squarely rooted in action dynamics. And you can see this carried over in the cinematic presentation of the monster, another aspect of engineered vision. Giger has come up with pretty cool tentacles and cocoon. But it's not half of it in shadows and half of it fused in the fabric and walls of the film, as in the first Alien. It is all of it in front of the camera. We see more, register less. There is a memorable dream scene. It is quite obviously separated from the 'reality' of the film - nothing here bleeds two ways, all the energy of watching goes to satisfy the desire to. It is fun to watch, as derivative and comfortable as a pair of slippers. And it is once again showcased in the film that Ben Kingsley is the most corny and ridiculous presence in movies. Still. I am tapping this for my cinematic Los Angeles project.

    I rather enjoyed this story about scientists taking the extra-terrestrial advice about reshaping DNA and then growing something from it only to have it escape, destroy, kill, kill, kill, kill, and have all the moral empathy of a rock. Producer Frank Mancuso Jr. does a pretty good job here bestowing a generous budget for special effects(H. R. Giger designed the creature), the cast which includes heavyweights like Ben Kingley, Forrest Whitaker, Alfred Molina(SOOO young here) as well as always fun to watch Michael Madsen and beauties Marge Helgenberger, newcomer Natasha Henstridge and a very young Michelle Willimas, a decent script, very workmanlike directing from Roger Donaldson(who generally does a good job creating suspense and action). All of these add up for a roller-coaster THAT did keep me on the edge of my seat. I cared about the characters, the story was inventive, and the acting was very good for a vehicle like this. Are there some big holes in the script? You betcha! Are some of the lines and the ending in particular a bit troublesome to swallow? Yes, again, but I liked the movie nonetheless. Kinglsey is very good in his role as a bureaucrat. Whitaker excels as an empath. Henstridge is absolutely stunning and very fresh. This is your typical government makes-a-mistake-then-gathers-a-group-of-experts film, but one that I thought was very well done and highly entertaining.

    I'm almost ashamed to say that the exquisitely perfect body of a fairly often nude Natasha Henstridge is my main reason for enjoying 'Species'. Aside of that, the film now seems slightly laughable, the SFX elementary and Alfred Molina, plain awful. Forest Whittaker isn't much better and Michael Madsen just stupid. Ben Kingsley adds some credence as the ruthless scientist who has "developed" the little girl who then goes on to grow up into a sex hungry alien who only wants to reproduce her own 'Species' with the help of human sperm. It's a film that I can quarter watch, whilst doing something else. I don't take it seriously and there is little suspense and is certainly not in the league of 'Alien' and the like. I don't really like any of the sequels and wouldn't watch them again. Yes, 7/10 is probably way too generous, but we all have illogical reasoning when it comes to things we really like.

    After escaping from a government lab, a team is gathered to track down he half-human, half-alien being disguised as a beautiful woman as she leaves a blood-soaked trail of carnage looking to mate. This wasn't all that bad and certainly has a lot going for it. The action-movie focus during the latter half results in some fine moments, as they chase her around town leading to scenes like the freeway chase into the hillside or the spectacular series of stalking and shoot-outs in the underground caves at the finale, among other top choices. The underground scenes in particular are among the film's best parts, as the disorienting caves, dark pits and waterways provide some great locations to generate some amazing shootouts and spectacle amongst it all. Other big action scenes are spread throughout the film and really help mask the fact that this is slightly too long, it's only big flaw, since there's several subplots that last too long or don't need to be included at all. Fortunately, the marvelous special effects for the alien being, abundant gore in the graphic kills and copious nudity also manage to overcome the film's rather weak CGI for the finale, and with enough tension and suspense from the main, make this one rather entertaining. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, several Sex Scenes and animal violence
