 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  This film is based on a true story about a British teenager who allegedly poisoned family, friends, and co-workers. Graham is highly intelligent, but completely amoral. He becomes interested in science, especially chemistry, and begins to read avidly. Something of a social misfit, he is fascinated by morbid subjects such as poisons and murder. His family environment is intolerable to him and, in particular, his stepmother torments him. He decides to poison those who annoy him, first with antimony and later with thallium. He smugly thinks himself cleverer than all those around him, but nevertheless he is caught and sentenced to 'rehabilitation' at a psychiatric institution. Once there, he undertakes to deceive the new eminent psychiatrist sent there to 'cure' him, thereby securing his release.

    The poisoner in question is Graham Young, played in early years by Tobias Arnold and then later by Hugh O' Conor, a true life psychopathic in 1960s England. A combination of "A Clockwork Orange" and "Fargo," this brilliant dark and vicious comedy-drama may well be the best unknown film I've ever seen. Graham became infamous after killing his step mom by spiking her food with thallium and after arrest is treated in a mental hospital. After his "cure" and release, the criminal genius reverts to his true nature and resumes his previous path of bad deeds. Along with Ted Bundy, Graham Young is one of the most interesting criminal subjects brought to the screen.

    This is a movie that I *wanted* to like. I just watched it for the second time and my reaction remained the same: indifferent. So we have this loose portrayal of Graham Young, a cold young man with a passion for poison. He poisons some family members, takes notes like a good scientist, prison, more poison, end. I liked the look of the film, and the acting was adequate. But it just drags. It's not dark enough to be disturbing (In a Glass Cage),and there's not enough humor to be a good black comedy (such as 1995's To Die For). Mechanical dialogue. None of the characters felt fleshed out enough to support a 90 minute viewing experience; the shallow characterizations would be fine for, say, appearances in a brief flashback scene. But full length films usually require some characters that aren't so 2 dimensional. A few nice moments, but I was disappointed.

    I came to this film expecting something darkly funny. Perhaps it is just the changing society from 1995 to 2008, but I fully captured the grit, the emotional void, the shallowness, and the stunted life views -but missed even a wisp of humor. Mid-way through the film, I openly wondered if there would be something that engaging or funny to come. But the extra time in viewership brought nothing of value. The sneak -peek into the living standards of a working-class English family kept me mildly interested. One did hope that the relationship between the main character - a boy killer who is trying to fake remorse - and his bunk mate - a young soldier in guilty suffering from an act of murder - would lead to some caring by a viewer about the characters. That hope is quickly dashed and the film grinds on. If one were looking for a film interesting, gritty, and or more lasting value, I'd suggest Jeffrey Wright in Basquiat.

    A young and intelligent degenerate poisons everyone in sight. The film works well as an interesting oddity, but fails completely as a (black) comedy; there is absolutely nothing funny about people getting poisoned and dying in extreme agony, especially since this is supposedly based on a true story. It would be funny if it were an all-out absurdist horror in the Peter Jackson vein, but it isn't. If I hadn't read that it was suppose to be comedic and if the film hadn't been promoted in its trailers as black comedy I would have never guessed that it was intended as such. There are also obvious references to "A Clockwork Orange", starting with its main theme (melody) which is used here several times. There are other - probably quite conscious - similarities to this film: the psychiatrist that wants to "cure" him; the two-year period that passes from capture to starting "recovery"; the attracting of attention to himself when the psychiatrist passes by the inmates; the question of whether a psychopathic freak can be cured or not (though not a main theme here), etc.

    Why has 'The Young Poisoner's Handbook' not developed a cult following? I have some theories, but this is certainly a film that should have found a larger audience at some point. This is pitch black British comedy near its best, reminiscent of both Hitchcock and 'A Clockwork Orange' -- its three-part structure is similar to that of 'A Clockwork Orange,' given that the protagonist is free, then confined, then free again to illustrate the vanity of "rehabilitation" where it concerns psychopaths, and we even hear excerpts from Purcell's Funeral Music for Queen Mary, which Wendy Carlos incorporated into her electronic score for 'Clockwork.' Whether 'The Young Poisoner's Handbook' is paying homage or borrowing, the movie itself is a highly individual work that should please anyone with a fondness for Orwell or Ealing. Hugh O'Conor, with his wide-eyed gift for simulating innocence, is an ideal selection for the role of Graham Young, the real-life poisoner of the British village of Bovingdon, who slowly poisoned his stepmother to death with antimony sulfide, finishing the job with thallium. Cursed with a banal home life and a sociopathic mind, his self-described "gift for chemistry" is put to obviously nefarious uses, occasionally using friends as guinea pigs before the main attraction. The director, Benjamin Ross, makes a tremendously impressive debut here. His selection of music together with his fluid editing and camera-work often produce stirring and exciting results, the 1960s small British town setting keenly observed, with a very black wit. Graham's wicked stepmother, played by the singular Ruth Sheen (seen in many Mike Leigh films), joyfully accepts her first dose of poison after finding a box of Velvet Victories chocolates on her bedroom pillow, with a note reading "To my darling mother, xxxx." There's a vivid sense of the dustiness of the Young household, the darkness of Graham's bedroom punctured by the eerie glow of his flasks, the frustration of an overcrowded working class household where the telly's always running with the silliness of popular variety programs. The film also adroitly contrasts the self-important grandeur of Young's genocidal ambitions with the unglamorous pettiness of the actual crimes and the prosaic Bovingdon environment to which his perpetration of them was fortunately limited (the real Graham Young had wanted to be known as "The World's Poisoner," but was instead given the considerably less flattering moniker "The Teacup Poisoner"). Absurdity and grimness are very skillfully balanced. A marvelous, overlooked film.

    I thought this film was brilliant. I actually found myself on the side of the main character, even though... ***SPOILER WARNING*** he killed his mother and was trying to kill his employees! The scene where he opens the cupboard to find all new mugs was devastating as it meant that his plan had gone wrong and he wouldn't be able to kill the people he wanted to! Alas!

    young poisoner's handbook clearly shows where it's stylish inspiration came from, i find it hilarious that certain reviewers can be so daft they are bashing this movie as a clockwork orange rip-off, the director wants us to know his inspirations, get it? furthermore, this is not a bad movie at all. the witty and funny yet insane atmosphere creates an enjoyable adult's fairytale. HOWEVER, remember this is not a fairytale. as far as info about young tells me he was a sick sick man who was fascinated with nazi's chemical methods and also used them. the world is full of evil murderers who have hands that are smooth as a baby's bottom.

    ...A Clockwork Orange to be precise. Which is something of a bafflement, as besides the occasional coincidental similarity the basic story ears no relation or resemblance to the Stanley Kubrick film or the Anthony Burgess novel. And they don't try to shy away from the fact that they've ripped off the film - they even use the same piece of music at certain times. So, inspired by the nadsat talk of the original and far superior film, the story is; Your Humble Narrator is only interesovatted in one lesson at the skolliwoll - Chemistry. He uses his knowledge to slowly poison his poor old pee and em but gets found out by the millecents and sent to Staja. There, he sucks up to the psychologist and gets an early release for being so horrorshow with the old chemicals. But once out, he begins poisoning the grahzny vonny malchicks and ptitsas at his firm, until they also figure out what he's up to and send him away again, O my brothers. And if you understood that you're a better man (or woman) than most. The film has identical shots and similar scenes to Kubrick's film, but has none of the originality or daring subject matter of it. As A Clockwork Orange was still banned when this film was released, I can only assume they thought no-one would remember what it was like and would let this pass. It makes absolutely no sense, but it has created a talking point that the film otherwise wouldn't have, since essentially this is nothing more than another average British movie.

    As a boy, Graham was always keen on chemistry. When he is introduced to a deadly chemical he begins to conduct experiments on his cruel family  namely by slowly poisoning his mother. Shortly after her death Graham is caught for her murder and sentenced to a mental institution. With help and treatment from a physiatrist, Graham is rehabilitated and released into the community. But can his love of poison be controlled? I first saw this in the cinema many years ago and held off writing a review because I wanted to be sure that I could give it a fair review  memory not that great you know. So I watched it on channel 4 last week and was quite taken aback  I didn't remember it being quite that dark and disturbed. The plot is quite like Kind Hearts & Coronets in the set up and delivery (more in the delivery) but is a lot darker and more cruel than that classic. The comedy is of the very dark type and mostly comes from Graham's narration. His narration plays his acceptance of very shocking events as run-of-the-mill things that happen in the background, this juxtaposition works well and makes it funny. The actual poisonings are not always easy to laugh through, while some of his mother's ordeal is played for laughs, most of it is quite cruel and upsetting. I think it worked well for playing the audience on the fact that we didn't quite know what this was  it was based on a true story yet was played for laughs as well as serious at times. However this same ploy is to it's weakness as it is difficult to settle into for this same reason. The director seems very assured and handles this better, mixing inappropriate music with the action as well as directing it very flat and clinically. O'Conor is the perfect choice for the role. Onscreen he is cold and cruel but it is his narration is where he excels  delivering perfectly deadpan lines. The support cast are all OK but mostly play exaggerated characters on the whole  British stereotypes and such. The film wisely leaves them as undeveloped this because if we cared too much for them or related to them then it would have been impossible to feel anything but revulsion for Graham. As cardboard cutouts they seem less than Graham in terms of the film (wonder how the real victims' families felt about this view). Overall this is a strange film but one that has enough going for it to be worht watching. However it should be noted that it is quite cruel and upsetting  we are not allowed to feel anything for Graham's victims. The humour is rarely laugh out loud funny and this will probably only be for those who like their comedy very dark.

    I saw a docu-drama on Graham Young several years ago and I remember it being rather cliched in style with characters complaining of feeling unwell followed by a jump cut to their funeral with Young standing at the graveside with a smug expression . Despite its flaws the docu-drama did at least stick to the true life story of Young unlike THE YOUNG POISONER`S HANDBOOK which starts with a disclaimer that many events are fictionalised . It`s no bad thing twisting the truth to this story because I`d have felt extremely guilty laughing out loud as people were poisoned The one obvious problem is Hugh O`Conor as Graham Young . He`s very good in the role but if the Young family are working class then why does young Graham speak with an upper class public schoolboy accent ? Couldn`t the director have told him to tone it down a bit ? Worse still - And there`s no way anyone would have known this in 1995 when the film was made - Mr O`Conor looks exactly like Gareth Gates . If you`ve no idea who GG is let me explain that he was runner up in Britain`s POP IDOL contest last year . He lost out to Will Young ( No relation I take it ) in the final but Gareth was the real star who became an even bigger selling artist than Will , all the teenage girls loved him due to his choir boy looks and perfect manners and I can`t hammer home enough the striking physical similarities between Mr Gates and Mr O`Conor . I spent the entire duration of THE YOUNG POISONER`S HANDBOOK convinced that the star of POP IDOL was killing people which made me laugh even louder Yeah but I shouldn`t have laughed . Despite much artistic license this is still a true story of how innocent people were murdered by a psycopath and I hope no one else decides to make more black comedies featuring mass murderers . I hate myself for enjoying this movie

    I saw a docu-drama on Graham Young several years ago and I remember it being rather cliched in style with characters complaining of feeling unwell followed by a jump cut to their funeral with Young standing at the graveside with a smug expression . Despite its flaws the docu-drama did at least stick to the true life story of Young unlike THE YOUNG POISONER`S HANDBOOK which starts with a disclaimer that many events are fictionalised . It`s no bad thing twisting the truth to this story because I`d have felt extremely guilty laughing out loud as people were poisoned The one obvious problem is Hugh O`Conor as Graham Young . He`s very good in the role but if the Young family are working class then why does young Graham speak with an upper class public schoolboy accent ? Couldn`t the director have told him to tone it down a bit ? Worse still - And there`s no way anyone would have known this in 1995 when the film was made - Mr O`Conor looks exactly like Gareth Gates . If you`ve no idea who GG is let me explain that he was runner up in Britain`s POP IDOL contest last year . He lost out to Will Young ( No relation I take it ) in the final but Gareth was the real star who became an even bigger selling artist than Will , all the teenage girls loved him due to his choir boy looks and perfect manners and I can`t hammer home enough the striking physical similarities between Mr Gates and Mr O`Conor . I spent the entire duration of THE YOUNG POISONER`S HANDBOOK convinced that the star of POP IDOL was killing people which made me laugh even louder Yeah but I shouldn`t have laughed . Despite much artistic license this is still a true story of how innocent people were murdered by a psycopath and I hope no one else decides to make more black comedies featuring mass murderers . I hate myself for enjoying this movie

    The poisoner in question is Graham Young, played in early years by Tobias Arnold and then later by Hugh O' Conor, a true life psychopathic in 1960s England. A combination of "A Clockwork Orange" and "Fargo," this brilliant dark and vicious comedy-drama may well be the best unknown film I've ever seen. Graham became infamous after killing his step mom by spiking her food with thallium and after arrest is treated in a mental hospital. After his "cure" and release, the criminal genius reverts to his true nature and resumes his previous path of bad deeds. Along with Ted Bundy, Graham Young is one of the most interesting criminal subjects brought to the screen.

    This is a movie that I *wanted* to like. I just watched it for the second time and my reaction remained the same: indifferent. So we have this loose portrayal of Graham Young, a cold young man with a passion for poison. He poisons some family members, takes notes like a good scientist, prison, more poison, end. I liked the look of the film, and the acting was adequate. But it just drags. It's not dark enough to be disturbing (In a Glass Cage),and there's not enough humor to be a good black comedy (such as 1995's To Die For). Mechanical dialogue. None of the characters felt fleshed out enough to support a 90 minute viewing experience; the shallow characterizations would be fine for, say, appearances in a brief flashback scene. But full length films usually require some characters that aren't so 2 dimensional. A few nice moments, but I was disappointed.

    I came to this film expecting something darkly funny. Perhaps it is just the changing society from 1995 to 2008, but I fully captured the grit, the emotional void, the shallowness, and the stunted life views -but missed even a wisp of humor. Mid-way through the film, I openly wondered if there would be something that engaging or funny to come. But the extra time in viewership brought nothing of value. The sneak -peek into the living standards of a working-class English family kept me mildly interested. One did hope that the relationship between the main character - a boy killer who is trying to fake remorse - and his bunk mate - a young soldier in guilty suffering from an act of murder - would lead to some caring by a viewer about the characters. That hope is quickly dashed and the film grinds on. If one were looking for a film interesting, gritty, and or more lasting value, I'd suggest Jeffrey Wright in Basquiat.

    A young and intelligent degenerate poisons everyone in sight. The film works well as an interesting oddity, but fails completely as a (black) comedy; there is absolutely nothing funny about people getting poisoned and dying in extreme agony, especially since this is supposedly based on a true story. It would be funny if it were an all-out absurdist horror in the Peter Jackson vein, but it isn't. If I hadn't read that it was suppose to be comedic and if the film hadn't been promoted in its trailers as black comedy I would have never guessed that it was intended as such. There are also obvious references to "A Clockwork Orange", starting with its main theme (melody) which is used here several times. There are other - probably quite conscious - similarities to this film: the psychiatrist that wants to "cure" him; the two-year period that passes from capture to starting "recovery"; the attracting of attention to himself when the psychiatrist passes by the inmates; the question of whether a psychopathic freak can be cured or not (though not a main theme here), etc.

    Why has 'The Young Poisoner's Handbook' not developed a cult following? I have some theories, but this is certainly a film that should have found a larger audience at some point. This is pitch black British comedy near its best, reminiscent of both Hitchcock and 'A Clockwork Orange' -- its three-part structure is similar to that of 'A Clockwork Orange,' given that the protagonist is free, then confined, then free again to illustrate the vanity of "rehabilitation" where it concerns psychopaths, and we even hear excerpts from Purcell's Funeral Music for Queen Mary, which Wendy Carlos incorporated into her electronic score for 'Clockwork.' Whether 'The Young Poisoner's Handbook' is paying homage or borrowing, the movie itself is a highly individual work that should please anyone with a fondness for Orwell or Ealing. Hugh O'Conor, with his wide-eyed gift for simulating innocence, is an ideal selection for the role of Graham Young, the real-life poisoner of the British village of Bovingdon, who slowly poisoned his stepmother to death with antimony sulfide, finishing the job with thallium. Cursed with a banal home life and a sociopathic mind, his self-described "gift for chemistry" is put to obviously nefarious uses, occasionally using friends as guinea pigs before the main attraction. The director, Benjamin Ross, makes a tremendously impressive debut here. His selection of music together with his fluid editing and camera-work often produce stirring and exciting results, the 1960s small British town setting keenly observed, with a very black wit. Graham's wicked stepmother, played by the singular Ruth Sheen (seen in many Mike Leigh films), joyfully accepts her first dose of poison after finding a box of Velvet Victories chocolates on her bedroom pillow, with a note reading "To my darling mother, xxxx." There's a vivid sense of the dustiness of the Young household, the darkness of Graham's bedroom punctured by the eerie glow of his flasks, the frustration of an overcrowded working class household where the telly's always running with the silliness of popular variety programs. The film also adroitly contrasts the self-important grandeur of Young's genocidal ambitions with the unglamorous pettiness of the actual crimes and the prosaic Bovingdon environment to which his perpetration of them was fortunately limited (the real Graham Young had wanted to be known as "The World's Poisoner," but was instead given the considerably less flattering moniker "The Teacup Poisoner"). Absurdity and grimness are very skillfully balanced. A marvelous, overlooked film.

    I thought this film was brilliant. I actually found myself on the side of the main character, even though... ***SPOILER WARNING*** he killed his mother and was trying to kill his employees! The scene where he opens the cupboard to find all new mugs was devastating as it meant that his plan had gone wrong and he wouldn't be able to kill the people he wanted to! Alas!

    young poisoner's handbook clearly shows where it's stylish inspiration came from, i find it hilarious that certain reviewers can be so daft they are bashing this movie as a clockwork orange rip-off, the director wants us to know his inspirations, get it? furthermore, this is not a bad movie at all. the witty and funny yet insane atmosphere creates an enjoyable adult's fairytale. HOWEVER, remember this is not a fairytale. as far as info about young tells me he was a sick sick man who was fascinated with nazi's chemical methods and also used them. the world is full of evil murderers who have hands that are smooth as a baby's bottom.

    ...A Clockwork Orange to be precise. Which is something of a bafflement, as besides the occasional coincidental similarity the basic story ears no relation or resemblance to the Stanley Kubrick film or the Anthony Burgess novel. And they don't try to shy away from the fact that they've ripped off the film - they even use the same piece of music at certain times. So, inspired by the nadsat talk of the original and far superior film, the story is; Your Humble Narrator is only interesovatted in one lesson at the skolliwoll - Chemistry. He uses his knowledge to slowly poison his poor old pee and em but gets found out by the millecents and sent to Staja. There, he sucks up to the psychologist and gets an early release for being so horrorshow with the old chemicals. But once out, he begins poisoning the grahzny vonny malchicks and ptitsas at his firm, until they also figure out what he's up to and send him away again, O my brothers. And if you understood that you're a better man (or woman) than most. The film has identical shots and similar scenes to Kubrick's film, but has none of the originality or daring subject matter of it. As A Clockwork Orange was still banned when this film was released, I can only assume they thought no-one would remember what it was like and would let this pass. It makes absolutely no sense, but it has created a talking point that the film otherwise wouldn't have, since essentially this is nothing more than another average British movie.

    As a boy, Graham was always keen on chemistry. When he is introduced to a deadly chemical he begins to conduct experiments on his cruel family  namely by slowly poisoning his mother. Shortly after her death Graham is caught for her murder and sentenced to a mental institution. With help and treatment from a physiatrist, Graham is rehabilitated and released into the community. But can his love of poison be controlled? I first saw this in the cinema many years ago and held off writing a review because I wanted to be sure that I could give it a fair review  memory not that great you know. So I watched it on channel 4 last week and was quite taken aback  I didn't remember it being quite that dark and disturbed. The plot is quite like Kind Hearts & Coronets in the set up and delivery (more in the delivery) but is a lot darker and more cruel than that classic. The comedy is of the very dark type and mostly comes from Graham's narration. His narration plays his acceptance of very shocking events as run-of-the-mill things that happen in the background, this juxtaposition works well and makes it funny. The actual poisonings are not always easy to laugh through, while some of his mother's ordeal is played for laughs, most of it is quite cruel and upsetting. I think it worked well for playing the audience on the fact that we didn't quite know what this was  it was based on a true story yet was played for laughs as well as serious at times. However this same ploy is to it's weakness as it is difficult to settle into for this same reason. The director seems very assured and handles this better, mixing inappropriate music with the action as well as directing it very flat and clinically. O'Conor is the perfect choice for the role. Onscreen he is cold and cruel but it is his narration is where he excels  delivering perfectly deadpan lines. The support cast are all OK but mostly play exaggerated characters on the whole  British stereotypes and such. The film wisely leaves them as undeveloped this because if we cared too much for them or related to them then it would have been impossible to feel anything but revulsion for Graham. As cardboard cutouts they seem less than Graham in terms of the film (wonder how the real victims' families felt about this view). Overall this is a strange film but one that has enough going for it to be worht watching. However it should be noted that it is quite cruel and upsetting  we are not allowed to feel anything for Graham's victims. The humour is rarely laugh out loud funny and this will probably only be for those who like their comedy very dark.
