    John Wayne embarks on a quest for sex in "The Quiet Man", a 1952 film by director John Ford. Wayne plays Sean Thornton, an American boxer who journeys to Ireland, the land of his birth. Here he attempts to woo the voluptuous Kate Danagher, played by Maureen O'Hara. Like most films "about" Ireland, "The Quiet Man's" packed to the brim with stereotypes. All Ford's townsfolk are staggering drunks, fiery redheads, rambunctious Catholics or uncouth brutes. His women, meanwhile, exist to be widows, virgins or young wives comically beaten by intoxicated louts. The film ends with a band of Irish folk granting Kate's hand in marriage to Sean; they're impressed with his manly boxing abilities. She loves being knocked around too. Ford clearly loves his band of Irish rascals, but this is Ireland as filtered through fantasy and clich&eacute;s. No Irish Troubles or religious conflict, just fields of green and bottles of gin. Wayne, meanwhile, is one of the most bizarre romantic leads in movie history. His scenes of courtship are awkward, frequently giving way to slaps, threats, condescending sexism and "humorous" wife "beatings". Like most Ford films, "Quiet" ends with regenerative violence, Wayne breaking skulls in the name of "family". It's not as insidious as some of Ford's other pictures, but almost. 4/10  Worth one viewing.

    If you thought that John Wayne cannot act this film proves you wrong. No gunfights, no posturing, no cattle drives and Rocky Mountain scenery to hide behind here. Just characters, .. Acting. If there is a bad performance in this film I just cannot see where. From Micheleen to the Station master, all spot on. Even the lady offering the stick to beat Maureen O'Hara with is just perfect. It is clich&eacute;d, I know. It is a "fantasy" Ireland I know. The characters are archetypal and exaggerated, .... again, I know. But, and it is a big but, no film I can think off gives me such an overwhelmingly good feeling. As it winds up I am immediately regretting its end, I just want it to go on and on. The constant, repetitive background music, (again, clich&eacute;d Irish fayre) is so spiritually uplifting, like the best ceilidh that you have ever heard. The whole film makes me feel like I did the first time I saw Riverdance. Oh, by the way, I am not Irish so you cannot lay that bias on me. I love Terminator 2, Dirty Harry films, Pulp Fiction and Star Wars/Trek et al. But they do not hold a candle to The Quiet Man". Best film of all time? Yes, I truly think so.

    I've just come back from seeing this film at the movies, and I had a heated discussion with my friends about it. I have to say that I found it really dated and offensive towards women. It's not only the fact that violence generally and specifically against women is glorified. I just couldn't stand the fact that the woman was expecting her husband to be violent against her. She doesn't respect him and thinks he's a coward until he finally gets all macho and treats her really rough, which is greeted by applause and cheers from the whole village. My friend argued that this was just how things were those days, but I think it's one thing to show how things are in society, and another to take a quite dubious custom and transform it into supposedly light entertainment. Although this was my main complaint about the movie, there were other aspects I didn't like: This seems to be more an American fantasy of idyllic Ireland than a remotely realistic portrait, and most of the actors do not even have an Irish accent, as far as I can judge. John Wayne's acting is quite bad, and the film is much too long for my taste. I liked the beautiful landscape though, and Maureen O'Hara is absolutely stunning. Also there were some funny moments that made me chuckle.

    Who doesn't love John Wayne? And Maureen O'Hara? Wow! Those two had chemistry and no mistake. Good friends in life they paired on screen better than most. Funny, sometimes silly, this movie still stands as great entertainment in the battle of the sexes. Although a bit thin in plot you quickly catch on that Sean Thornton is home to stay and the amusing wrangling to buy back the family home play out in the most satisfying set up for brother "Squire Danaher" to be at loggerheads with Sean as he attempts to woo his darlin' Mary Kate Danaher, sister of the Squire himself. The sparks do fly but all too quickly the story is told and we are left only to smile as the ups and downs are sorted out "in no time at all". Truly a classic worth watching time and again if you find yerself feelin blue and missing thoughts of days gone by in happier times when the sun is shining most lovely on fields that seem always green and the troubles at present be too much for 'ye. Enjoy!

    As soon as I saw Barry Fitzgerald, I was transported to that scene in Going My Way where he meets with his elderly mother from Ireland. There are no tear-jerking moments in this film, which is full of laughs. The film is known for being the second collaboration between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. This collaboration started in 1951 with Rio Grande, and followed by this film, Wings of Eagles, McClintock, and Big Jake. These two made the perfect couple. The film was shot in Ireland for all the exterior shots. The beauty of that country and the great music made it a timeless film that can be enjoyed over and over.

    The plot is about an American who returns to his Irish ancestral homeland and buys his ancestral home for far more than it was worth. This happens to annoy a local man who wanted the land, and said man is more annoyed when the American falls in love with his sister, and she with him. The problem is presumably resolved when the American marries the sister, while the brother expects to marry the young widow who owned the land-but the widow refuses to marry the man, and the offended brother refuses to pay the promised dowry to his sister. The American tries to convince his new bride that the dowry is unimportant, but she is adamant as a matter of principle. Either he must fight his brother-in-law, or face contempt from both the townspeople and his wife. Yet there is one problem-the American turns out to be a former boxer who accidentally killed an opponent, and who in fact went to Ireland in the first place to leave this past behind him. Now instead of the happy quiet existence he hoped to have, he is forced to consider doing what he hoped never to do again. What to do? The answer is all too predictable, and admittedly the story has an overly happy Hollywood ending. But still the performers excel (even John Wayne, whom I don't usually like), and one sees what it is like to face an unwanted moral dilemma.

    To say that this film "promotes wife-beating" is beyond preposterous. The worst thing John Wayne does to Maureen O'Hara is to give her a largely symbolic and clearly harmless 'boot in the backside' - something which by that point in the film her character has richly earned. This is no more violent nor misogynistic than, say, the opening scene in The Philadelphia Story. Or scenes in many, many other films that show men and women roughhousing with each other, essentially by mutual consent. Furthermore, to see this film as *promoting* violence, against women or anyone else, is to miss it's main point, by a country mile. This is a film about exactly that peculiar cultural norm, in which violence becomes sublimated into traditions of friendship and caring. It's a film that suggests how our violent natures and our violent past are evolving. Even the title should make this obvious. John Wayne's character is so appalled by violence that he's run as far away from it as he can, to what he views as a garden of Eden. But the seeds of violence remain in his nature, and in those around him. What makes the Ireland of this film an Eden indeed is how the culture has turned malicious violence into a formality, a sort of stylized ritual of friendship. One could say that this is a criticism of Ireland, and perhaps an unwarranted one. Of course, it's not. It could not be more obvious that Ford is using a mythic Ireland to make a point about all of human culture in the mid-20th Century. He suggests that perhaps we are violent animals, but that denying our nature isn't the right answer. He suggests that a healthy culture uses tradition to formalize conflict and allow it to play out in a benign and even creative way. Wayne at first fails to understand that this ritualized 'violence' is not the real thing. That it conveys love, not malice. That it's a peculiar but lively tradition, which acts as a conduit for the relationships of both men and women. Whether all this takes place in anything resembling the 'real' Ireland is obviously irrelevant. This Ireland of Ford's fond remembering is as real as Hilton and Capra's Shangri-La. It's a heaven that we all seek. In a way, Ford's Ireland is an answer to Hilton's. Ford asserts that a paradise that depends on humans acting like angels is unrealistic. We need a paradise where we can acknowledge our darker side, and turn it into a positive thing. Does Ford succeed in making that point? That's another question... But I would say that he does, brilliantly. The Quiet Man is a love story, a story of deep friendship - between the two supposed antagonists, Wayne and McLaglen, who are clearly destined to be devoted friends. Moreover, The Quiet Man is a brilliant evocation of every human's personal quest for a separate peace, a place where they can be themselves, only better. The Quiet Man is one of the greatest masterpieces of film, always in my own top five. It's also one of the most enjoyable, uplifting films of all time. If you emerged from it with any other feeling than joy, you brought that feeling in with you, and simply refused to let go of it.

    This movie was recommended to me by my relatives. And there is much to recommend it: Maureen O ' Hara's brother writing down people's names if they did something he did not like (is this an older version of kicking someone's butt and taking their name?); the courting rituals were great - takes me back to a time before even me - made me even more aware of our hedonistic society where people are mating like dogs in heat - 75% of their children out of wedlock; John Wayne trying to take control of his wedding night & failing; and John Wayne dragging Maureen O' Hara home for miles (he'd be in jail today for that kind of treatment.) But the fight scene is the classic moment - John & the brother fought seemingly from Innisfree to Dublin! This fell short of Rowdy Roddy Piper and Keith David in They LIve, but it was humorous - still not bad for 1952. I was wondering why I missed this film - but then I was only 4 years old & my parents would not have let me see such violence - well, actually they would have. I guess my enduring thought as I watched this classic was: What would Quentin have done with this picture? Sorry for the sacrilege, Auntie.

    Sean Thornton (John Wayne) arrives by train in Castletown in Ireland coming from Pittsburgh and in the train station, he seeks direction to Inisfree. Michaleen Oge Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) comes with his horse- drawn chaise and takes Sean to Inisfree. Along their way, Sean sees the red-haired Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara) in the field and a cottage in White O'Morn that belongs to the widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick). Sean tells to Michaleen that he was born in that cottage and he wants to buy the real-estate. The coachman recognizes him and then they meet Father Peter Lonergan (Ward Bond) that had known Sean's family and welcomes him. When Sean meets Ms. Tillane, her neighbor Squire 'Red' Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) that wants to buy the property and marry Tillane is very upset with her. When she sells the real-estate to Sean, Will becomes his declared enemy. Sean decides to get married with Mary Kate and he hires the service of the matchmaker Michaleen; however, he does not succeed since Mary Kate is the sister of Will Danaher. However, Michaleen, Father Peter Lonergan, and other locals lure Will and he consents the marriage of his sister expecting to marry the widow Tillane. When he finds that he was deceived, he does not pay the dowry for his sister. Mary Kate tries to force Sean to take her money by force from her brother, but Sean does not want to fight against Will Danaher. Mary Kate and the locals believe that he is a coward, but Sean actually wants to forget a fatal incident from his past and start a new life. "A Quiet Man" is a delightful romantic comedy by John Ford. The Irish Maureen O'Hara is sensational in the role of a stubborn woman that wants her dowry no matter how. John Wayne is hilarious in the role of a man that wants to forget his past and start a new life. The situations are very funny in the small Irish village and I loved when a woman gives a stick to Sean to beat the lovely lady. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "Depois do Vendaval" ("After the Windstorm")

    While I will admit that this is not the greatest film ever made, I would argue that it's one of the most entertaining. This, combined with lovely acting, nice directing from John Ford, a great script and fine location shooting make this a film you must see. On top of that, the film crosses several genres--with some fine romance, a bit of comedy and a lot of escapism. The film begins with an American (John Wayne) wandering into a small Irish town. It seems that his family was originally from there and he wants to settle there. However, from the very start, an obnoxious brute (Victor McLaglen) stands in his way to buy some property and then things heat up when Wayne begins dating McLaglen's sister (Maureen O'Hara). However, this version of John Wayne doesn't just slug McLaglen--he hates violence and is hiding a secret. What's next? See the film. Perhaps the best thing about the film is the wonderful cast of supporting characters--one of the best in Hollywood history. You have Barry Fitzgerald, Arthur Shields (Fiztgerald's real-life brother), Midred Natwick, Ward Bond and many others to provide color and a touch of the Old Country. It's thoroughly charming and sweet throughout--see this film. It's near perfection!

And there is much to recommend it: Maureen O ' Hara's brother writing down people's names if they did something he did not like (is this an older version of kicking someone's butt and taking their name?); the courting rituals were great - takes me back to a time before even me - made me even more aware of our hedonistic society where people are mating like dogs in heat - 75% of their children out of wedlock; John Wayne trying to take control of his wedding night & failing; and John Wayne dragging Maureen O' Hara home for miles (he'd be in jail today for that kind of treatment.) But the fight scene is the classic moment - John & the brother fought seemingly from Innisfree to Dublin! This fell short of Rowdy Roddy Piper and Keith David in They LIve, but it was humorous - still not bad for 1952. I was wondering why I missed this film - but then I was only 4 years old & my parents would not have let me see such violence - well, actually they would have. I guess my enduring thought as I watched this classic was: What would Quentin have done with this picture? Sorry for the sacrilege, Auntie.

    Sean Thornton (John Wayne) arrives by train in Castletown in Ireland coming from Pittsburgh and in the train station, he seeks direction to Inisfree. Michaleen Oge Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) comes with his horse- drawn chaise and takes Sean to Inisfree. Along their way, Sean sees the red-haired Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara) in the field and a cottage in White O'Morn that belongs to the widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick). Sean tells to Michaleen that he was born in that cottage and he wants to buy the real-estate. The coachman recognizes him and then they meet Father Peter Lonergan (Ward Bond) that had known Sean's family and welcomes him. When Sean meets Ms. Tillane, her neighbor Squire 'Red' Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) that wants to buy the property and marry Tillane is very upset with her. When she sells the real-estate to Sean, Will becomes his declared enemy. Sean decides to get married with Mary Kate and he hires the service of the matchmaker Michaleen; however, he does not succeed since Mary Kate is the sister of Will Danaher. However, Michaleen, Father Peter Lonergan, and other locals lure Will and he consents the marriage of his sister expecting to marry the widow Tillane. When he finds that he was deceived, he does not pay the dowry for his sister. Mary Kate tries to force Sean to take her money by force from her brother, but Sean does not want to fight against Will Danaher. Mary Kate and the locals believe that he is a coward, but Sean actually wants to forget a fatal incident from his past and start a new life. "A Quiet Man" is a delightful romantic comedy by John Ford. The Irish Maureen O'Hara is sensational in the role of a stubborn woman that wants her dowry no matter how. John Wayne is hilarious in the role of a man that wants to forget his past and start a new life. The situations are very funny in the small Irish village and I loved when a woman gives a stick to Sean to beat the lovely lady. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "Depois do Vendaval" ("After the Windstorm")

    While I will admit that this is not the greatest film ever made, I would argue that it's one of the most entertaining. This, combined with lovely acting, nice directing from John Ford, a great script and fine location shooting make this a film you must see. On top of that, the film crosses several genres--with some fine romance, a bit of comedy and a lot of escapism. The film begins with an American (John Wayne) wandering into a small Irish town. It seems that his family was originally from there and he wants to settle there. However, from the very start, an obnoxious brute (Victor McLaglen) stands in his way to buy some property and then things heat up when Wayne begins dating McLaglen's sister (Maureen O'Hara). However, this version of John Wayne doesn't just slug McLaglen--he hates violence and is hiding a secret. What's next? See the film. Perhaps the best thing about the film is the wonderful cast of supporting characters--one of the best in Hollywood history. You have Barry Fitzgerald, Arthur Shields (Fiztgerald's real-life brother), Midred Natwick, Ward Bond and many others to provide color and a touch of the Old Country. It's thoroughly charming and sweet throughout--see this film. It's near perfection!

    John Wayne embarks on a quest for sex in "The Quiet Man", a 1952 film by director John Ford. Wayne plays Sean Thornton, an American boxer who journeys to Ireland, the land of his birth. Here he attempts to woo the voluptuous Kate Danagher, played by Maureen O'Hara. Like most films "about" Ireland, "The Quiet Man's" packed to the brim with stereotypes. All Ford's townsfolk are staggering drunks, fiery redheads, rambunctious Catholics or uncouth brutes. His women, meanwhile, exist to be widows, virgins or young wives comically beaten by intoxicated louts. The film ends with a band of Irish folk granting Kate's hand in marriage to Sean; they're impressed with his manly boxing abilities. She loves being knocked around too. Ford clearly loves his band of Irish rascals, but this is Ireland as filtered through fantasy and clich&eacute;s. No Irish Troubles or religious conflict, just fields of green and bottles of gin. Wayne, meanwhile, is one of the most bizarre romantic leads in movie history. His scenes of courtship are awkward, frequently giving way to slaps, threats, condescending sexism and "humorous" wife "beatings". Like most Ford films, "Quiet" ends with regenerative violence, Wayne breaking skulls in the name of "family". It's not as insidious as some of Ford's other pictures, but almost. 4/10  Worth one viewing.

    If you thought that John Wayne cannot act this film proves you wrong. No gunfights, no posturing, no cattle drives and Rocky Mountain scenery to hide behind here. Just characters, .. Acting. If there is a bad performance in this film I just cannot see where. From Micheleen to the Station master, all spot on. Even the lady offering the stick to beat Maureen O'Hara with is just perfect. It is clich&eacute;d, I know. It is a "fantasy" Ireland I know. The characters are archetypal and exaggerated, .... again, I know. But, and it is a big but, no film I can think off gives me such an overwhelmingly good feeling. As it winds up I am immediately regretting its end, I just want it to go on and on. The constant, repetitive background music, (again, clich&eacute;d Irish fayre) is so spiritually uplifting, like the best ceilidh that you have ever heard. The whole film makes me feel like I did the first time I saw Riverdance. Oh, by the way, I am not Irish so you cannot lay that bias on me. I love Terminator 2, Dirty Harry films, Pulp Fiction and Star Wars/Trek et al. But they do not hold a candle to The Quiet Man". Best film of all time? Yes, I truly think so.

    I've just come back from seeing this film at the movies, and I had a heated discussion with my friends about it. I have to say that I found it really dated and offensive towards women. It's not only the fact that violence generally and specifically against women is glorified. I just couldn't stand the fact that the woman was expecting her husband to be violent against her. She doesn't respect him and thinks he's a coward until he finally gets all macho and treats her really rough, which is greeted by applause and cheers from the whole village. My friend argued that this was just how things were those days, but I think it's one thing to show how things are in society, and another to take a quite dubious custom and transform it into supposedly light entertainment. Although this was my main complaint about the movie, there were other aspects I didn't like: This seems to be more an American fantasy of idyllic Ireland than a remotely realistic portrait, and most of the actors do not even have an Irish accent, as far as I can judge. John Wayne's acting is quite bad, and the film is much too long for my taste. I liked the beautiful landscape though, and Maureen O'Hara is absolutely stunning. Also there were some funny moments that made me chuckle.

    Who doesn't love John Wayne? And Maureen O'Hara? Wow! Those two had chemistry and no mistake. Good friends in life they paired on screen better than most. Funny, sometimes silly, this movie still stands as great entertainment in the battle of the sexes. Although a bit thin in plot you quickly catch on that Sean Thornton is home to stay and the amusing wrangling to buy back the family home play out in the most satisfying set up for brother "Squire Danaher" to be at loggerheads with Sean as he attempts to woo his darlin' Mary Kate Danaher, sister of the Squire himself. The sparks do fly but all too quickly the story is told and we are left only to smile as the ups and downs are sorted out "in no time at all". Truly a classic worth watching time and again if you find yerself feelin blue and missing thoughts of days gone by in happier times when the sun is shining most lovely on fields that seem always green and the troubles at present be too much for 'ye. Enjoy!

    As soon as I saw Barry Fitzgerald, I was transported to that scene in Going My Way where he meets with his elderly mother from Ireland. There are no tear-jerking moments in this film, which is full of laughs. The film is known for being the second collaboration between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. This collaboration started in 1951 with Rio Grande, and followed by this film, Wings of Eagles, McClintock, and Big Jake. These two made the perfect couple. The film was shot in Ireland for all the exterior shots. The beauty of that country and the great music made it a timeless film that can be enjoyed over and over.

    The plot is about an American who returns to his Irish ancestral homeland and buys his ancestral home for far more than it was worth. This happens to annoy a local man who wanted the land, and said man is more annoyed when the American falls in love with his sister, and she with him. The problem is presumably resolved when the American marries the sister, while the brother expects to marry the young widow who owned the land-but the widow refuses to marry the man, and the offended brother refuses to pay the promised dowry to his sister. The American tries to convince his new bride that the dowry is unimportant, but she is adamant as a matter of principle. Either he must fight his brother-in-law, or face contempt from both the townspeople and his wife. Yet there is one problem-the American turns out to be a former boxer who accidentally killed an opponent, and who in fact went to Ireland in the first place to leave this past behind him. Now instead of the happy quiet existence he hoped to have, he is forced to consider doing what he hoped never to do again. What to do? The answer is all too predictable, and admittedly the story has an overly happy Hollywood ending. But still the performers excel (even John Wayne, whom I don't usually like), and one sees what it is like to face an unwanted moral dilemma.

    To say that this film "promotes wife-beating" is beyond preposterous. The worst thing John Wayne does to Maureen O'Hara is to give her a largely symbolic and clearly harmless 'boot in the backside' - something which by that point in the film her character has richly earned. This is no more violent nor misogynistic than, say, the opening scene in The Philadelphia Story. Or scenes in many, many other films that show men and women roughhousing with each other, essentially by mutual consent. Furthermore, to see this film as *promoting* violence, against women or anyone else, is to miss it's main point, by a country mile. This is a film about exactly that peculiar cultural norm, in which violence becomes sublimated into traditions of friendship and caring. It's a film that suggests how our violent natures and our violent past are evolving. Even the title should make this obvious. John Wayne's character is so appalled by violence that he's run as far away from it as he can, to what he views as a garden of Eden. But the seeds of violence remain in his nature, and in those around him. What makes the Ireland of this film an Eden indeed is how the culture has turned malicious violence into a formality, a sort of stylized ritual of friendship. One could say that this is a criticism of Ireland, and perhaps an unwarranted one. Of course, it's not. It could not be more obvious that Ford is using a mythic Ireland to make a point about all of human culture in the mid-20th Century. He suggests that perhaps we are violent animals, but that denying our nature isn't the right answer. He suggests that a healthy culture uses tradition to formalize conflict and allow it to play out in a benign and even creative way. Wayne at first fails to understand that this ritualized 'violence' is not the real thing. That it conveys love, not malice. That it's a peculiar but lively tradition, which acts as a conduit for the relationships of both men and women. Whether all this takes place in anything resembling the 'real' Ireland is obviously irrelevant. This Ireland of Ford's fond remembering is as real as Hilton and Capra's Shangri-La. It's a heaven that we all seek. In a way, Ford's Ireland is an answer to Hilton's. Ford asserts that a paradise that depends on humans acting like angels is unrealistic. We need a paradise where we can acknowledge our darker side, and turn it into a positive thing. Does Ford succeed in making that point? That's another question... But I would say that he does, brilliantly. The Quiet Man is a love story, a story of deep friendship - between the two supposed antagonists, Wayne and McLaglen, who are clearly destined to be devoted friends. Moreover, The Quiet Man is a brilliant evocation of every human's personal quest for a separate peace, a place where they can be themselves, only better. The Quiet Man is one of the greatest masterpieces of film, always in my own top five. It's also one of the most enjoyable, uplifting films of all time. If you emerged from it with any other feeling than joy, you brought that feeling in with you, and simply refused to let go of it.

Furthermore, to see this film as *promoting* violence, against women or anyone else, is to miss it's main point, by a country mile. This is a film about exactly that peculiar cultural norm, in which violence becomes sublimated into traditions of friendship and caring. It's a film that suggests how our violent natures and our violent past are evolving. Even the title should make this obvious. John Wayne's character is so appalled by violence that he's run as far away from it as he can, to what he views as a garden of Eden. But the seeds of violence remain in his nature, and in those around him. What makes the Ireland of this film an Eden indeed is how the culture has turned malicious violence into a formality, a sort of stylized ritual of friendship. One could say that this is a criticism of Ireland, and perhaps an unwarranted one. Of course, it's not. It could not be more obvious that Ford is using a mythic Ireland to make a point about all of human culture in the mid-20th Century. He suggests that perhaps we are violent animals, but that denying our nature isn't the right answer. He suggests that a healthy culture uses tradition to formalize conflict and allow it to play out in a benign and even creative way. Wayne at first fails to understand that this ritualized 'violence' is not the real thing. That it conveys love, not malice. That it's a peculiar but lively tradition, which acts as a conduit for the relationships of both men and women. Whether all this takes place in anything resembling the 'real' Ireland is obviously irrelevant. This Ireland of Ford's fond remembering is as real as Hilton and Capra's Shangri-La. It's a heaven that we all seek. In a way, Ford's Ireland is an answer to Hilton's. Ford asserts that a paradise that depends on humans acting like angels is unrealistic. We need a paradise where we can acknowledge our darker side, and turn it into a positive thing. Does Ford succeed in making that point? That's another question... But I would say that he does, brilliantly. The Quiet Man is a love story, a story of deep friendship - between the two supposed antagonists, Wayne and McLaglen, who are clearly destined to be devoted friends. Moreover, The Quiet Man is a brilliant evocation of every human's personal quest for a separate peace, a place where they can be themselves, only better. The Quiet Man is one of the greatest masterpieces of film, always in my own top five. It's also one of the most enjoyable, uplifting films of all time. If you emerged from it with any other feeling than joy, you brought that feeling in with you, and simply refused to let go of it.

    This movie was recommended to me by my relatives. And there is much to recommend it: Maureen O ' Hara's brother writing down people's names if they did something he did not like (is this an older version of kicking someone's butt and taking their name?); the courting rituals were great - takes me back to a time before even me - made me even more aware of our hedonistic society where people are mating like dogs in heat - 75% of their children out of wedlock; John Wayne trying to take control of his wedding night & failing; and John Wayne dragging Maureen O' Hara home for miles (he'd be in jail today for that kind of treatment.) But the fight scene is the classic moment - John & the brother fought seemingly from Innisfree to Dublin! This fell short of Rowdy Roddy Piper and Keith David in They LIve, but it was humorous - still not bad for 1952. I was wondering why I missed this film - but then I was only 4 years old & my parents would not have let me see such violence - well, actually they would have. I guess my enduring thought as I watched this classic was: What would Quentin have done with this picture? Sorry for the sacrilege, Auntie.

    Sean Thornton (John Wayne) arrives by train in Castletown in Ireland coming from Pittsburgh and in the train station, he seeks direction to Inisfree. Michaleen Oge Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) comes with his horse- drawn chaise and takes Sean to Inisfree. Along their way, Sean sees the red-haired Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara) in the field and a cottage in White O'Morn that belongs to the widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick). Sean tells to Michaleen that he was born in that cottage and he wants to buy the real-estate. The coachman recognizes him and then they meet Father Peter Lonergan (Ward Bond) that had known Sean's family and welcomes him. When Sean meets Ms. Tillane, her neighbor Squire 'Red' Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) that wants to buy the property and marry Tillane is very upset with her. When she sells the real-estate to Sean, Will becomes his declared enemy. Sean decides to get married with Mary Kate and he hires the service of the matchmaker Michaleen; however, he does not succeed since Mary Kate is the sister of Will Danaher. However, Michaleen, Father Peter Lonergan, and other locals lure Will and he consents the marriage of his sister expecting to marry the widow Tillane. When he finds that he was deceived, he does not pay the dowry for his sister. Mary Kate tries to force Sean to take her money by force from her brother, but Sean does not want to fight against Will Danaher. Mary Kate and the locals believe that he is a coward, but Sean actually wants to forget a fatal incident from his past and start a new life. "A Quiet Man" is a delightful romantic comedy by John Ford. The Irish Maureen O'Hara is sensational in the role of a stubborn woman that wants her dowry no matter how. John Wayne is hilarious in the role of a man that wants to forget his past and start a new life. The situations are very funny in the small Irish village and I loved when a woman gives a stick to Sean to beat the lovely lady. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "Depois do Vendaval" ("After the Windstorm")

    While I will admit that this is not the greatest film ever made, I would argue that it's one of the most entertaining. This, combined with lovely acting, nice directing from John Ford, a great script and fine location shooting make this a film you must see. On top of that, the film crosses several genres--with some fine romance, a bit of comedy and a lot of escapism. The film begins with an American (John Wayne) wandering into a small Irish town. It seems that his family was originally from there and he wants to settle there. However, from the very start, an obnoxious brute (Victor McLaglen) stands in his way to buy some property and then things heat up when Wayne begins dating McLaglen's sister (Maureen O'Hara). However, this version of John Wayne doesn't just slug McLaglen--he hates violence and is hiding a secret. What's next? See the film. Perhaps the best thing about the film is the wonderful cast of supporting characters--one of the best in Hollywood history. You have Barry Fitzgerald, Arthur Shields (Fiztgerald's real-life brother), Midred Natwick, Ward Bond and many others to provide color and a touch of the Old Country. It's thoroughly charming and sweet throughout--see this film. It's near perfection!

    John Wayne embarks on a quest for sex in "The Quiet Man", a 1952 film by director John Ford. Wayne plays Sean Thornton, an American boxer who journeys to Ireland, the land of his birth. Here he attempts to woo the voluptuous Kate Danagher, played by Maureen O'Hara. Like most films "about" Ireland, "The Quiet Man's" packed to the brim with stereotypes. All Ford's townsfolk are staggering drunks, fiery redheads, rambunctious Catholics or uncouth brutes. His women, meanwhile, exist to be widows, virgins or young wives comically beaten by intoxicated louts. The film ends with a band of Irish folk granting Kate's hand in marriage to Sean; they're impressed with his manly boxing abilities. She loves being knocked around too. Ford clearly loves his band of Irish rascals, but this is Ireland as filtered through fantasy and clich&eacute;s. No Irish Troubles or religious conflict, just fields of green and bottles of gin. Wayne, meanwhile, is one of the most bizarre romantic leads in movie history. His scenes of courtship are awkward, frequently giving way to slaps, threats, condescending sexism and "humorous" wife "beatings". Like most Ford films, "Quiet" ends with regenerative violence, Wayne breaking skulls in the name of "family". It's not as insidious as some of Ford's other pictures, but almost. 4/10  Worth one viewing.

    If you thought that John Wayne cannot act this film proves you wrong. No gunfights, no posturing, no cattle drives and Rocky Mountain scenery to hide behind here. Just characters, .. Acting. If there is a bad performance in this film I just cannot see where. From Micheleen to the Station master, all spot on. Even the lady offering the stick to beat Maureen O'Hara with is just perfect. It is clich&eacute;d, I know. It is a "fantasy" Ireland I know. The characters are archetypal and exaggerated, .... again, I know. But, and it is a big but, no film I can think off gives me such an overwhelmingly good feeling. As it winds up I am immediately regretting its end, I just want it to go on and on. The constant, repetitive background music, (again, clich&eacute;d Irish fayre) is so spiritually uplifting, like the best ceilidh that you have ever heard. The whole film makes me feel like I did the first time I saw Riverdance. Oh, by the way, I am not Irish so you cannot lay that bias on me. I love Terminator 2, Dirty Harry films, Pulp Fiction and Star Wars/Trek et al. But they do not hold a candle to The Quiet Man". Best film of all time? Yes, I truly think so.

    I've just come back from seeing this film at the movies, and I had a heated discussion with my friends about it. I have to say that I found it really dated and offensive towards women. It's not only the fact that violence generally and specifically against women is glorified. I just couldn't stand the fact that the woman was expecting her husband to be violent against her. She doesn't respect him and thinks he's a coward until he finally gets all macho and treats her really rough, which is greeted by applause and cheers from the whole village. My friend argued that this was just how things were those days, but I think it's one thing to show how things are in society, and another to take a quite dubious custom and transform it into supposedly light entertainment. Although this was my main complaint about the movie, there were other aspects I didn't like: This seems to be more an American fantasy of idyllic Ireland than a remotely realistic portrait, and most of the actors do not even have an Irish accent, as far as I can judge. John Wayne's acting is quite bad, and the film is much too long for my taste. I liked the beautiful landscape though, and Maureen O'Hara is absolutely stunning. Also there were some funny moments that made me chuckle.

    Who doesn't love John Wayne? And Maureen O'Hara? Wow! Those two had chemistry and no mistake. Good friends in life they paired on screen better than most. Funny, sometimes silly, this movie still stands as great entertainment in the battle of the sexes. Although a bit thin in plot you quickly catch on that Sean Thornton is home to stay and the amusing wrangling to buy back the family home play out in the most satisfying set up for brother "Squire Danaher" to be at loggerheads with Sean as he attempts to woo his darlin' Mary Kate Danaher, sister of the Squire himself. The sparks do fly but all too quickly the story is told and we are left only to smile as the ups and downs are sorted out "in no time at all". Truly a classic worth watching time and again if you find yerself feelin blue and missing thoughts of days gone by in happier times when the sun is shining most lovely on fields that seem always green and the troubles at present be too much for 'ye. Enjoy!

    As soon as I saw Barry Fitzgerald, I was transported to that scene in Going My Way where he meets with his elderly mother from Ireland. There are no tear-jerking moments in this film, which is full of laughs. The film is known for being the second collaboration between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. This collaboration started in 1951 with Rio Grande, and followed by this film, Wings of Eagles, McClintock, and Big Jake. These two made the perfect couple. The film was shot in Ireland for all the exterior shots. The beauty of that country and the great music made it a timeless film that can be enjoyed over and over.

    The plot is about an American who returns to his Irish ancestral homeland and buys his ancestral home for far more than it was worth. This happens to annoy a local man who wanted the land, and said man is more annoyed when the American falls in love with his sister, and she with him. The problem is presumably resolved when the American marries the sister, while the brother expects to marry the young widow who owned the land-but the widow refuses to marry the man, and the offended brother refuses to pay the promised dowry to his sister. The American tries to convince his new bride that the dowry is unimportant, but she is adamant as a matter of principle. Either he must fight his brother-in-law, or face contempt from both the townspeople and his wife. Yet there is one problem-the American turns out to be a former boxer who accidentally killed an opponent, and who in fact went to Ireland in the first place to leave this past behind him. Now instead of the happy quiet existence he hoped to have, he is forced to consider doing what he hoped never to do again. What to do? The answer is all too predictable, and admittedly the story has an overly happy Hollywood ending. But still the performers excel (even John Wayne, whom I don't usually like), and one sees what it is like to face an unwanted moral dilemma.

    To say that this film "promotes wife-beating" is beyond preposterous. The worst thing John Wayne does to Maureen O'Hara is to give her a largely symbolic and clearly harmless 'boot in the backside' - something which by that point in the film her character has richly earned. This is no more violent nor misogynistic than, say, the opening scene in The Philadelphia Story. Or scenes in many, many other films that show men and women roughhousing with each other, essentially by mutual consent. Furthermore, to see this film as *promoting* violence, against women or anyone else, is to miss it's main point, by a country mile. This is a film about exactly that peculiar cultural norm, in which violence becomes sublimated into traditions of friendship and caring. It's a film that suggests how our violent natures and our violent past are evolving. Even the title should make this obvious. John Wayne's character is so appalled by violence that he's run as far away from it as he can, to what he views as a garden of Eden. But the seeds of violence remain in his nature, and in those around him. What makes the Ireland of this film an Eden indeed is how the culture has turned malicious violence into a formality, a sort of stylized ritual of friendship. One could say that this is a criticism of Ireland, and perhaps an unwarranted one. Of course, it's not. It could not be more obvious that Ford is using a mythic Ireland to make a point about all of human culture in the mid-20th Century. He suggests that perhaps we are violent animals, but that denying our nature isn't the right answer. He suggests that a healthy culture uses tradition to formalize conflict and allow it to play out in a benign and even creative way. Wayne at first fails to understand that this ritualized 'violence' is not the real thing. That it conveys love, not malice. That it's a peculiar but lively tradition, which acts as a conduit for the relationships of both men and women. Whether all this takes place in anything resembling the 'real' Ireland is obviously irrelevant. This Ireland of Ford's fond remembering is as real as Hilton and Capra's Shangri-La.

There are no tear-jerking moments in this film, which is full of laughs. The film is known for being the second collaboration between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. This collaboration started in 1951 with Rio Grande, and followed by this film, Wings of Eagles, McClintock, and Big Jake. These two made the perfect couple. The film was shot in Ireland for all the exterior shots. The beauty of that country and the great music made it a timeless film that can be enjoyed over and over.

    The plot is about an American who returns to his Irish ancestral homeland and buys his ancestral home for far more than it was worth. This happens to annoy a local man who wanted the land, and said man is more annoyed when the American falls in love with his sister, and she with him. The problem is presumably resolved when the American marries the sister, while the brother expects to marry the young widow who owned the land-but the widow refuses to marry the man, and the offended brother refuses to pay the promised dowry to his sister. The American tries to convince his new bride that the dowry is unimportant, but she is adamant as a matter of principle. Either he must fight his brother-in-law, or face contempt from both the townspeople and his wife. Yet there is one problem-the American turns out to be a former boxer who accidentally killed an opponent, and who in fact went to Ireland in the first place to leave this past behind him. Now instead of the happy quiet existence he hoped to have, he is forced to consider doing what he hoped never to do again. What to do? The answer is all too predictable, and admittedly the story has an overly happy Hollywood ending. But still the performers excel (even John Wayne, whom I don't usually like), and one sees what it is like to face an unwanted moral dilemma.

    To say that this film "promotes wife-beating" is beyond preposterous. The worst thing John Wayne does to Maureen O'Hara is to give her a largely symbolic and clearly harmless 'boot in the backside' - something which by that point in the film her character has richly earned. This is no more violent nor misogynistic than, say, the opening scene in The Philadelphia Story. Or scenes in many, many other films that show men and women roughhousing with each other, essentially by mutual consent. Furthermore, to see this film as *promoting* violence, against women or anyone else, is to miss it's main point, by a country mile. This is a film about exactly that peculiar cultural norm, in which violence becomes sublimated into traditions of friendship and caring. It's a film that suggests how our violent natures and our violent past are evolving. Even the title should make this obvious. John Wayne's character is so appalled by violence that he's run as far away from it as he can, to what he views as a garden of Eden. But the seeds of violence remain in his nature, and in those around him. What makes the Ireland of this film an Eden indeed is how the culture has turned malicious violence into a formality, a sort of stylized ritual of friendship. One could say that this is a criticism of Ireland, and perhaps an unwarranted one. Of course, it's not. It could not be more obvious that Ford is using a mythic Ireland to make a point about all of human culture in the mid-20th Century. He suggests that perhaps we are violent animals, but that denying our nature isn't the right answer. He suggests that a healthy culture uses tradition to formalize conflict and allow it to play out in a benign and even creative way. Wayne at first fails to understand that this ritualized 'violence' is not the real thing. That it conveys love, not malice. That it's a peculiar but lively tradition, which acts as a conduit for the relationships of both men and women. Whether all this takes place in anything resembling the 'real' Ireland is obviously irrelevant. This Ireland of Ford's fond remembering is as real as Hilton and Capra's Shangri-La. It's a heaven that we all seek. In a way, Ford's Ireland is an answer to Hilton's. Ford asserts that a paradise that depends on humans acting like angels is unrealistic. We need a paradise where we can acknowledge our darker side, and turn it into a positive thing. Does Ford succeed in making that point? That's another question... But I would say that he does, brilliantly. The Quiet Man is a love story, a story of deep friendship - between the two supposed antagonists, Wayne and McLaglen, who are clearly destined to be devoted friends. Moreover, The Quiet Man is a brilliant evocation of every human's personal quest for a separate peace, a place where they can be themselves, only better. The Quiet Man is one of the greatest masterpieces of film, always in my own top five. It's also one of the most enjoyable, uplifting films of all time. If you emerged from it with any other feeling than joy, you brought that feeling in with you, and simply refused to let go of it.

    This movie was recommended to me by my relatives. And there is much to recommend it: Maureen O ' Hara's brother writing down people's names if they did something he did not like (is this an older version of kicking someone's butt and taking their name?); the courting rituals were great - takes me back to a time before even me - made me even more aware of our hedonistic society where people are mating like dogs in heat - 75% of their children out of wedlock; John Wayne trying to take control of his wedding night & failing; and John Wayne dragging Maureen O' Hara home for miles (he'd be in jail today for that kind of treatment.) But the fight scene is the classic moment - John & the brother fought seemingly from Innisfree to Dublin! This fell short of Rowdy Roddy Piper and Keith David in They LIve, but it was humorous - still not bad for 1952. I was wondering why I missed this film - but then I was only 4 years old & my parents would not have let me see such violence - well, actually they would have. I guess my enduring thought as I watched this classic was: What would Quentin have done with this picture? Sorry for the sacrilege, Auntie.

    Sean Thornton (John Wayne) arrives by train in Castletown in Ireland coming from Pittsburgh and in the train station, he seeks direction to Inisfree. Michaleen Oge Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) comes with his horse- drawn chaise and takes Sean to Inisfree. Along their way, Sean sees the red-haired Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara) in the field and a cottage in White O'Morn that belongs to the widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick). Sean tells to Michaleen that he was born in that cottage and he wants to buy the real-estate. The coachman recognizes him and then they meet Father Peter Lonergan (Ward Bond) that had known Sean's family and welcomes him. When Sean meets Ms. Tillane, her neighbor Squire 'Red' Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) that wants to buy the property and marry Tillane is very upset with her. When she sells the real-estate to Sean, Will becomes his declared enemy. Sean decides to get married with Mary Kate and he hires the service of the matchmaker Michaleen; however, he does not succeed since Mary Kate is the sister of Will Danaher. However, Michaleen, Father Peter Lonergan, and other locals lure Will and he consents the marriage of his sister expecting to marry the widow Tillane. When he finds that he was deceived, he does not pay the dowry for his sister. Mary Kate tries to force Sean to take her money by force from her brother, but Sean does not want to fight against Will Danaher. Mary Kate and the locals believe that he is a coward, but Sean actually wants to forget a fatal incident from his past and start a new life. "A Quiet Man" is a delightful romantic comedy by John Ford. The Irish Maureen O'Hara is sensational in the role of a stubborn woman that wants her dowry no matter how. John Wayne is hilarious in the role of a man that wants to forget his past and start a new life. The situations are very funny in the small Irish village and I loved when a woman gives a stick to Sean to beat the lovely lady. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "Depois do Vendaval" ("After the Windstorm")

    While I will admit that this is not the greatest film ever made, I would argue that it's one of the most entertaining. This, combined with lovely acting, nice directing from John Ford, a great script and fine location shooting make this a film you must see. On top of that, the film crosses several genres--with some fine romance, a bit of comedy and a lot of escapism. The film begins with an American (John Wayne) wandering into a small Irish town. It seems that his family was originally from there and he wants to settle there. However, from the very start, an obnoxious brute (Victor McLaglen) stands in his way to buy some property and then things heat up when Wayne begins dating McLaglen's sister (Maureen O'Hara). However, this version of John Wayne doesn't just slug McLaglen--he hates violence and is hiding a secret. What's next? See the film. Perhaps the best thing about the film is the wonderful cast of supporting characters--one of the best in Hollywood history. You have Barry Fitzgerald, Arthur Shields (Fiztgerald's real-life brother), Midred Natwick, Ward Bond and many others to provide color and a touch of the Old Country. It's thoroughly charming and sweet throughout--see this film. It's near perfection!

    John Wayne embarks on a quest for sex in "The Quiet Man", a 1952 film by director John Ford. Wayne plays Sean Thornton, an American boxer who journeys to Ireland, the land of his birth. Here he attempts to woo the voluptuous Kate Danagher, played by Maureen O'Hara. Like most films "about" Ireland, "The Quiet Man's" packed to the brim with stereotypes. All Ford's townsfolk are staggering drunks, fiery redheads, rambunctious Catholics or uncouth brutes. His women, meanwhile, exist to be widows, virgins or young wives comically beaten by intoxicated louts. The film ends with a band of Irish folk granting Kate's hand in marriage to Sean; they're impressed with his manly boxing abilities. She loves being knocked around too. Ford clearly loves his band of Irish rascals, but this is Ireland as filtered through fantasy and clich&eacute;s. No Irish Troubles or religious conflict, just fields of green and bottles of gin. Wayne, meanwhile, is one of the most bizarre romantic leads in movie history. His scenes of courtship are awkward, frequently giving way to slaps, threats, condescending sexism and "humorous" wife "beatings". Like most Ford films, "Quiet" ends with regenerative violence, Wayne breaking skulls in the name of "family". It's not as insidious as some of Ford's other pictures, but almost. 4/10  Worth one viewing.

    If you thought that John Wayne cannot act this film proves you wrong. No gunfights, no posturing, no cattle drives and Rocky Mountain scenery to hide behind here. Just characters, .. Acting. If there is a bad performance in this film I just cannot see where. From Micheleen to the Station master, all spot on. Even the lady offering the stick to beat Maureen O'Hara with is just perfect. It is clich&eacute;d, I know. It is a "fantasy" Ireland I know. The characters are archetypal and exaggerated, .... again, I know. But, and it is a big but, no film I can think off gives me such an overwhelmingly good feeling. As it winds up I am immediately regretting its end, I just want it to go on and on. The constant, repetitive background music, (again, clich&eacute;d Irish fayre) is so spiritually uplifting, like the best ceilidh that you have ever heard. The whole film makes me feel like I did the first time I saw Riverdance. Oh, by the way, I am not Irish so you cannot lay that bias on me. I love Terminator 2, Dirty Harry films, Pulp Fiction and Star Wars/Trek et al. But they do not hold a candle to The Quiet Man". Best film of all time? Yes, I truly think so.

    I've just come back from seeing this film at the movies, and I had a heated discussion with my friends about it. I have to say that I found it really dated and offensive towards women. It's not only the fact that violence generally and specifically against women is glorified. I just couldn't stand the fact that the woman was expecting her husband to be violent against her. She doesn't respect him and thinks he's a coward until he finally gets all macho and treats her really rough, which is greeted by applause and cheers from the whole village. My friend argued that this was just how things were those days, but I think it's one thing to show how things are in society, and another to take a quite dubious custom and transform it into supposedly light entertainment. Although this was my main complaint about the movie, there were other aspects I didn't like: This seems to be more an American fantasy of idyllic Ireland than a remotely realistic portrait, and most of the actors do not even have an Irish accent, as far as I can judge. John Wayne's acting is quite bad, and the film is much too long for my taste. I liked the beautiful landscape though, and Maureen O'Hara is absolutely stunning. Also there were some funny moments that made me chuckle.

    Who doesn't love John Wayne? And Maureen O'Hara? Wow! Those two had chemistry and no mistake. Good friends in life they paired on screen better than most. Funny, sometimes silly, this movie still stands as great entertainment in the battle of the sexes. Although a bit thin in plot you quickly catch on that Sean Thornton is home to stay and the amusing wrangling to buy back the family home play out in the most satisfying set up for brother "Squire Danaher" to be at loggerheads with Sean as he attempts to woo his darlin' Mary Kate Danaher, sister of the Squire himself. The sparks do fly but all too quickly the story is told and we are left only to smile as the ups and downs are sorted out "in no time at all". Truly a classic worth watching time and again if you find yerself feelin blue and missing thoughts of days gone by in happier times when the sun is shining most lovely on fields that seem always green and the troubles at present be too much for 'ye. Enjoy!

    As soon as I saw Barry Fitzgerald, I was transported to that scene in Going My Way where he meets with his elderly mother from Ireland. There are no tear-jerking moments in this film, which is full of laughs. The film is known for being the second collaboration between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. This collaboration started in 1951 with Rio Grande, and followed by this film, Wings of Eagles, McClintock, and Big Jake. These two made the perfect couple. The film was shot in Ireland for all the exterior shots. The beauty of that country and the great music made it a timeless film that can be enjoyed over and over.

    I've just come back from seeing this film at the movies, and I had a heated discussion with my friends about it. I have to say that I found it really dated and offensive towards women. It's not only the fact that violence generally and specifically against women is glorified. I just couldn't stand the fact that the woman was expecting her husband to be violent against her. She doesn't respect him and thinks he's a coward until he finally gets all macho and treats her really rough, which is greeted by applause and cheers from the whole village. My friend argued that this was just how things were those days, but I think it's one thing to show how things are in society, and another to take a quite dubious custom and transform it into supposedly light entertainment. Although this was my main complaint about the movie, there were other aspects I didn't like: This seems to be more an American fantasy of idyllic Ireland than a remotely realistic portrait, and most of the actors do not even have an Irish accent, as far as I can judge. John Wayne's acting is quite bad, and the film is much too long for my taste. I liked the beautiful landscape though, and Maureen O'Hara is absolutely stunning. Also there were some funny moments that made me chuckle.

    Who doesn't love John Wayne? And Maureen O'Hara? Wow! Those two had chemistry and no mistake. Good friends in life they paired on screen better than most. Funny, sometimes silly, this movie still stands as great entertainment in the battle of the sexes. Although a bit thin in plot you quickly catch on that Sean Thornton is home to stay and the amusing wrangling to buy back the family home play out in the most satisfying set up for brother "Squire Danaher" to be at loggerheads with Sean as he attempts to woo his darlin' Mary Kate Danaher, sister of the Squire himself. The sparks do fly but all too quickly the story is told and we are left only to smile as the ups and downs are sorted out "in no time at all". Truly a classic worth watching time and again if you find yerself feelin blue and missing thoughts of days gone by in happier times when the sun is shining most lovely on fields that seem always green and the troubles at present be too much for 'ye. Enjoy!

    As soon as I saw Barry Fitzgerald, I was transported to that scene in Going My Way where he meets with his elderly mother from Ireland. There are no tear-jerking moments in this film, which is full of laughs. The film is known for being the second collaboration between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. This collaboration started in 1951 with Rio Grande, and followed by this film, Wings of Eagles, McClintock, and Big Jake. These two made the perfect couple. The film was shot in Ireland for all the exterior shots. The beauty of that country and the great music made it a timeless film that can be enjoyed over and over.

    The plot is about an American who returns to his Irish ancestral homeland and buys his ancestral home for far more than it was worth. This happens to annoy a local man who wanted the land, and said man is more annoyed when the American falls in love with his sister, and she with him. The problem is presumably resolved when the American marries the sister, while the brother expects to marry the young widow who owned the land-but the widow refuses to marry the man, and the offended brother refuses to pay the promised dowry to his sister. The American tries to convince his new bride that the dowry is unimportant, but she is adamant as a matter of principle. Either he must fight his brother-in-law, or face contempt from both the townspeople and his wife. Yet there is one problem-the American turns out to be a former boxer who accidentally killed an opponent, and who in fact went to Ireland in the first place to leave this past behind him. Now instead of the happy quiet existence he hoped to have, he is forced to consider doing what he hoped never to do again. What to do? The answer is all too predictable, and admittedly the story has an overly happy Hollywood ending. But still the performers excel (even John Wayne, whom I don't usually like), and one sees what it is like to face an unwanted moral dilemma.

    To say that this film "promotes wife-beating" is beyond preposterous. The worst thing John Wayne does to Maureen O'Hara is to give her a largely symbolic and clearly harmless 'boot in the backside' - something which by that point in the film her character has richly earned. This is no more violent nor misogynistic than, say, the opening scene in The Philadelphia Story. Or scenes in many, many other films that show men and women roughhousing with each other, essentially by mutual consent. Furthermore, to see this film as *promoting* violence, against women or anyone else, is to miss it's main point, by a country mile. This is a film about exactly that peculiar cultural norm, in which violence becomes sublimated into traditions of friendship and caring. It's a film that suggests how our violent natures and our violent past are evolving. Even the title should make this obvious. John Wayne's character is so appalled by violence that he's run as far away from it as he can, to what he views as a garden of Eden. But the seeds of violence remain in his nature, and in those around him. What makes the Ireland of this film an Eden indeed is how the culture has turned malicious violence into a formality, a sort of stylized ritual of friendship. One could say that this is a criticism of Ireland, and perhaps an unwarranted one. Of course, it's not. It could not be more obvious that Ford is using a mythic Ireland to make a point about all of human culture in the mid-20th Century. He suggests that perhaps we are violent animals, but that denying our nature isn't the right answer. He suggests that a healthy culture uses tradition to formalize conflict and allow it to play out in a benign and even creative way. Wayne at first fails to understand that this ritualized 'violence' is not the real thing. That it conveys love, not malice. That it's a peculiar but lively tradition, which acts as a conduit for the relationships of both men and women. Whether all this takes place in anything resembling the 'real' Ireland is obviously irrelevant. This Ireland of Ford's fond remembering is as real as Hilton and Capra's Shangri-La. It's a heaven that we all seek. In a way, Ford's Ireland is an answer to Hilton's. Ford asserts that a paradise that depends on humans acting like angels is unrealistic. We need a paradise where we can acknowledge our darker side, and turn it into a positive thing. Does Ford succeed in making that point? That's another question... But I would say that he does, brilliantly. The Quiet Man is a love story, a story of deep friendship - between the two supposed antagonists, Wayne and McLaglen, who are clearly destined to be devoted friends. Moreover, The Quiet Man is a brilliant evocation of every human's personal quest for a separate peace, a place where they can be themselves, only better. The Quiet Man is one of the greatest masterpieces of film, always in my own top five. It's also one of the most enjoyable, uplifting films of all time. If you emerged from it with any other feeling than joy, you brought that feeling in with you, and simply refused to let go of it.

    This movie was recommended to me by my relatives. And there is much to recommend it: Maureen O ' Hara's brother writing down people's names if they did something he did not like (is this an older version of kicking someone's butt and taking their name?); the courting rituals were great - takes me back to a time before even me - made me even more aware of our hedonistic society where people are mating like dogs in heat - 75% of their children out of wedlock; John Wayne trying to take control of his wedding night & failing; and John Wayne dragging Maureen O' Hara home for miles (he'd be in jail today for that kind of treatment.) But the fight scene is the classic moment - John & the brother fought seemingly from Innisfree to Dublin! This fell short of Rowdy Roddy Piper and Keith David in They LIve, but it was humorous - still not bad for 1952. I was wondering why I missed this film - but then I was only 4 years old & my parents would not have let me see such violence - well, actually they would have. I guess my enduring thought as I watched this classic was: What would Quentin have done with this picture? Sorry for the sacrilege, Auntie.

    Sean Thornton (John Wayne) arrives by train in Castletown in Ireland coming from Pittsburgh and in the train station, he seeks direction to Inisfree. Michaleen Oge Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) comes with his horse- drawn chaise and takes Sean to Inisfree. Along their way, Sean sees the red-haired Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara) in the field and a cottage in White O'Morn that belongs to the widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick). Sean tells to Michaleen that he was born in that cottage and he wants to buy the real-estate. The coachman recognizes him and then they meet Father Peter Lonergan (Ward Bond) that had known Sean's family and welcomes him. When Sean meets Ms. Tillane, her neighbor Squire 'Red' Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) that wants to buy the property and marry Tillane is very upset with her. When she sells the real-estate to Sean, Will becomes his declared enemy. Sean decides to get married with Mary Kate and he hires the service of the matchmaker Michaleen; however, he does not succeed since Mary Kate is the sister of Will Danaher. However, Michaleen, Father Peter Lonergan, and other locals lure Will and he consents the marriage of his sister expecting to marry the widow Tillane. When he finds that he was deceived, he does not pay the dowry for his sister. Mary Kate tries to force Sean to take her money by force from her brother, but Sean does not want to fight against Will Danaher. Mary Kate and the locals believe that he is a coward, but Sean actually wants to forget a fatal incident from his past and start a new life. "A Quiet Man" is a delightful romantic comedy by John Ford. The Irish Maureen O'Hara is sensational in the role of a stubborn woman that wants her dowry no matter how. John Wayne is hilarious in the role of a man that wants to forget his past and start a new life. The situations are very funny in the small Irish village and I loved when a woman gives a stick to Sean to beat the lovely lady. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "Depois do Vendaval" ("After the Windstorm")

    While I will admit that this is not the greatest film ever made, I would argue that it's one of the most entertaining. This, combined with lovely acting, nice directing from John Ford, a great script and fine location shooting make this a film you must see. On top of that, the film crosses several genres--with some fine romance, a bit of comedy and a lot of escapism. The film begins with an American (John Wayne) wandering into a small Irish town. It seems that his family was originally from there and he wants to settle there. However, from the very start, an obnoxious brute (Victor McLaglen) stands in his way to buy some property and then things heat up when Wayne begins dating McLaglen's sister (Maureen O'Hara). However, this version of John Wayne doesn't just slug McLaglen--he hates violence and is hiding a secret. What's next? See the film. Perhaps the best thing about the film is the wonderful cast of supporting characters--one of the best in Hollywood history. You have Barry Fitzgerald, Arthur Shields (Fiztgerald's real-life brother), Midred Natwick, Ward Bond and many others to provide color and a touch of the Old Country. It's thoroughly charming and sweet throughout--see this film. It's near perfection!

    John Wayne embarks on a quest for sex in "The Quiet Man", a 1952 film by director John Ford. Wayne plays Sean Thornton, an American boxer who journeys to Ireland, the land of his birth. Here he attempts to woo the voluptuous Kate Danagher, played by Maureen O'Hara. Like most films "about" Ireland, "The Quiet Man's" packed to the brim with stereotypes. All Ford's townsfolk are staggering drunks, fiery redheads, rambunctious Catholics or uncouth brutes. His women, meanwhile, exist to be widows, virgins or young wives comically beaten by intoxicated louts. The film ends with a band of Irish folk granting Kate's hand in marriage to Sean; they're impressed with his manly boxing abilities. She loves being knocked around too. Ford clearly loves his band of Irish rascals, but this is Ireland as filtered through fantasy and clich&eacute;s. No Irish Troubles or religious conflict, just fields of green and bottles of gin. Wayne, meanwhile, is one of the most bizarre romantic leads in movie history. His scenes of courtship are awkward, frequently giving way to slaps, threats, condescending sexism and "humorous" wife "beatings". Like most Ford films, "Quiet" ends with regenerative violence, Wayne breaking skulls in the name of "family". It's not as insidious as some of Ford's other pictures, but almost. 4/10  Worth one viewing.

    If you thought that John Wayne cannot act this film proves you wrong. No gunfights, no posturing, no cattle drives and Rocky Mountain scenery to hide behind here. Just characters, .. Acting. If there is a bad performance in this film I just cannot see where. From Micheleen to the Station master, all spot on. Even the lady offering the stick to beat Maureen O'Hara with is just perfect. It is clich&eacute;d, I know. It is a "fantasy" Ireland I know. The characters are archetypal and exaggerated, .... again, I know. But, and it is a big but, no film I can think off gives me such an overwhelmingly good feeling. As it winds up I am immediately regretting its end, I just want it to go on and on. The constant, repetitive background music, (again, clich&eacute;d Irish fayre) is so spiritually uplifting, like the best ceilidh that you have ever heard. The whole film makes me feel like I did the first time I saw Riverdance. Oh, by the way, I am not Irish so you cannot lay that bias on me. I love Terminator 2, Dirty Harry films, Pulp Fiction and Star Wars/Trek et al. But they do not hold a candle to The Quiet Man". Best film of all time? Yes, I truly think so.

It's not only the fact that violence generally and specifically against women is glorified. I just couldn't stand the fact that the woman was expecting her husband to be violent against her. She doesn't respect him and thinks he's a coward until he finally gets all macho and treats her really rough, which is greeted by applause and cheers from the whole village. My friend argued that this was just how things were those days, but I think it's one thing to show how things are in society, and another to take a quite dubious custom and transform it into supposedly light entertainment. Although this was my main complaint about the movie, there were other aspects I didn't like: This seems to be more an American fantasy of idyllic Ireland than a remotely realistic portrait, and most of the actors do not even have an Irish accent, as far as I can judge. John Wayne's acting is quite bad, and the film is much too long for my taste. I liked the beautiful landscape though, and Maureen O'Hara is absolutely stunning.

His women, meanwhile, exist to be widows, virgins or young wives comically beaten by intoxicated louts. The film ends with a band of Irish folk granting Kate's hand in marriage to Sean; they're impressed with his manly boxing abilities. She loves being knocked around too. Ford clearly loves his band of Irish rascals, but this is Ireland as filtered through fantasy and clich&eacute;s. No Irish Troubles or religious conflict, just fields of green and bottles of gin. Wayne, meanwhile, is one of the most bizarre romantic leads in movie history. His scenes of courtship are awkward, frequently giving way to slaps, threats, condescending sexism and "humorous" wife "beatings". Like most Ford films, "Quiet" ends with regenerative violence, Wayne breaking skulls in the name of "family". It's not as insidious as some of Ford's other pictures, but almost. 4/10  Worth one viewing.

    If you thought that John Wayne cannot act this film proves you wrong. No gunfights, no posturing, no cattle drives and Rocky Mountain scenery to hide behind here. Just characters, .. Acting. If there is a bad performance in this film I just cannot see where. From Micheleen to the Station master, all spot on. Even the lady offering the stick to beat Maureen O'Hara with is just perfect. It is clich&eacute;d, I know. It is a "fantasy" Ireland I know. The characters are archetypal and exaggerated, .... again, I know. But, and it is a big but, no film I can think off gives me such an overwhelmingly good feeling. As it winds up I am immediately regretting its end, I just want it to go on and on. The constant, repetitive background music, (again, clich&eacute;d Irish fayre) is so spiritually uplifting, like the best ceilidh that you have ever heard. The whole film makes me feel like I did the first time I saw Riverdance. Oh, by the way, I am not Irish so you cannot lay that bias on me. I love Terminator 2, Dirty Harry films, Pulp Fiction and Star Wars/Trek et al. But they do not hold a candle to The Quiet Man". Best film of all time? Yes, I truly think so.

    I've just come back from seeing this film at the movies, and I had a heated discussion with my friends about it. I have to say that I found it really dated and offensive towards women. It's not only the fact that violence generally and specifically against women is glorified. I just couldn't stand the fact that the woman was expecting her husband to be violent against her. She doesn't respect him and thinks he's a coward until he finally gets all macho and treats her really rough, which is greeted by applause and cheers from the whole village. My friend argued that this was just how things were those days, but I think it's one thing to show how things are in society, and another to take a quite dubious custom and transform it into supposedly light entertainment. Although this was my main complaint about the movie, there were other aspects I didn't like: This seems to be more an American fantasy of idyllic Ireland than a remotely realistic portrait, and most of the actors do not even have an Irish accent, as far as I can judge. John Wayne's acting is quite bad, and the film is much too long for my taste. I liked the beautiful landscape though, and Maureen O'Hara is absolutely stunning. Also there were some funny moments that made me chuckle.

    Who doesn't love John Wayne? And Maureen O'Hara? Wow! Those two had chemistry and no mistake. Good friends in life they paired on screen better than most. Funny, sometimes silly, this movie still stands as great entertainment in the battle of the sexes. Although a bit thin in plot you quickly catch on that Sean Thornton is home to stay and the amusing wrangling to buy back the family home play out in the most satisfying set up for brother "Squire Danaher" to be at loggerheads with Sean as he attempts to woo his darlin' Mary Kate Danaher, sister of the Squire himself. The sparks do fly but all too quickly the story is told and we are left only to smile as the ups and downs are sorted out "in no time at all". Truly a classic worth watching time and again if you find yerself feelin blue and missing thoughts of days gone by in happier times when the sun is shining most lovely on fields that seem always green and the troubles at present be too much for 'ye. Enjoy!

    As soon as I saw Barry Fitzgerald, I was transported to that scene in Going My Way where he meets with his elderly mother from Ireland. There are no tear-jerking moments in this film, which is full of laughs. The film is known for being the second collaboration between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. This collaboration started in 1951 with Rio Grande, and followed by this film, Wings of Eagles, McClintock, and Big Jake. These two made the perfect couple. The film was shot in Ireland for all the exterior shots. The beauty of that country and the great music made it a timeless film that can be enjoyed over and over.

    The plot is about an American who returns to his Irish ancestral homeland and buys his ancestral home for far more than it was worth. This happens to annoy a local man who wanted the land, and said man is more annoyed when the American falls in love with his sister, and she with him. The problem is presumably resolved when the American marries the sister, while the brother expects to marry the young widow who owned the land-but the widow refuses to marry the man, and the offended brother refuses to pay the promised dowry to his sister. The American tries to convince his new bride that the dowry is unimportant, but she is adamant as a matter of principle. Either he must fight his brother-in-law, or face contempt from both the townspeople and his wife. Yet there is one problem-the American turns out to be a former boxer who accidentally killed an opponent, and who in fact went to Ireland in the first place to leave this past behind him. Now instead of the happy quiet existence he hoped to have, he is forced to consider doing what he hoped never to do again. What to do? The answer is all too predictable, and admittedly the story has an overly happy Hollywood ending. But still the performers excel (even John Wayne, whom I don't usually like), and one sees what it is like to face an unwanted moral dilemma.

    To say that this film "promotes wife-beating" is beyond preposterous. The worst thing John Wayne does to Maureen O'Hara is to give her a largely symbolic and clearly harmless 'boot in the backside' - something which by that point in the film her character has richly earned. This is no more violent nor misogynistic than, say, the opening scene in The Philadelphia Story. Or scenes in many, many other films that show men and women roughhousing with each other, essentially by mutual consent. Furthermore, to see this film as *promoting* violence, against women or anyone else, is to miss it's main point, by a country mile. This is a film about exactly that peculiar cultural norm, in which violence becomes sublimated into traditions of friendship and caring. It's a film that suggests how our violent natures and our violent past are evolving. Even the title should make this obvious. John Wayne's character is so appalled by violence that he's run as far away from it as he can, to what he views as a garden of Eden. But the seeds of violence remain in his nature, and in those around him. What makes the Ireland of this film an Eden indeed is how the culture has turned malicious violence into a formality, a sort of stylized ritual of friendship. One could say that this is a criticism of Ireland, and perhaps an unwarranted one. Of course, it's not. It could not be more obvious that Ford is using a mythic Ireland to make a point about all of human culture in the mid-20th Century. He suggests that perhaps we are violent animals, but that denying our nature isn't the right answer. He suggests that a healthy culture uses tradition to formalize conflict and allow it to play out in a benign and even creative way. Wayne at first fails to understand that this ritualized 'violence' is not the real thing. That it conveys love, not malice. That it's a peculiar but lively tradition, which acts as a conduit for the relationships of both men and women. Whether all this takes place in anything resembling the 'real' Ireland is obviously irrelevant. This Ireland of Ford's fond remembering is as real as Hilton and Capra's Shangri-La. It's a heaven that we all seek. In a way, Ford's Ireland is an answer to Hilton's. Ford asserts that a paradise that depends on humans acting like angels is unrealistic. We need a paradise where we can acknowledge our darker side, and turn it into a positive thing. Does Ford succeed in making that point? That's another question... But I would say that he does, brilliantly. The Quiet Man is a love story, a story of deep friendship - between the two supposed antagonists, Wayne and McLaglen, who are clearly destined to be devoted friends. Moreover, The Quiet Man is a brilliant evocation of every human's personal quest for a separate peace, a place where they can be themselves, only better. The Quiet Man is one of the greatest masterpieces of film, always in my own top five. It's also one of the most enjoyable, uplifting films of all time. If you emerged from it with any other feeling than joy, you brought that feeling in with you, and simply refused to let go of it.

    This movie was recommended to me by my relatives. And there is much to recommend it: Maureen O ' Hara's brother writing down people's names if they did something he did not like (is this an older version of kicking someone's butt and taking their name?); the courting rituals were great - takes me back to a time before even me - made me even more aware of our hedonistic society where people are mating like dogs in heat - 75% of their children out of wedlock; John Wayne trying to take control of his wedding night & failing; and John Wayne dragging Maureen O' Hara home for miles (he'd be in jail today for that kind of treatment.) But the fight scene is the classic moment - John & the brother fought seemingly from Innisfree to Dublin! This fell short of Rowdy Roddy Piper and Keith David in They LIve, but it was humorous - still not bad for 1952. I was wondering why I missed this film - but then I was only 4 years old & my parents would not have let me see such violence - well, actually they would have. I guess my enduring thought as I watched this classic was: What would Quentin have done with this picture? Sorry for the sacrilege, Auntie.

    Sean Thornton (John Wayne) arrives by train in Castletown in Ireland coming from Pittsburgh and in the train station, he seeks direction to Inisfree. Michaleen Oge Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) comes with his horse- drawn chaise and takes Sean to Inisfree. Along their way, Sean sees the red-haired Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara) in the field and a cottage in White O'Morn that belongs to the widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick). Sean tells to Michaleen that he was born in that cottage and he wants to buy the real-estate. The coachman recognizes him and then they meet Father Peter Lonergan (Ward Bond) that had known Sean's family and welcomes him. When Sean meets Ms. Tillane, her neighbor Squire 'Red' Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) that wants to buy the property and marry Tillane is very upset with her. When she sells the real-estate to Sean, Will becomes his declared enemy. Sean decides to get married with Mary Kate and he hires the service of the matchmaker Michaleen; however, he does not succeed since Mary Kate is the sister of Will Danaher. However, Michaleen, Father Peter Lonergan, and other locals lure Will and he consents the marriage of his sister expecting to marry the widow Tillane. When he finds that he was deceived, he does not pay the dowry for his sister. Mary Kate tries to force Sean to take her money by force from her brother, but Sean does not want to fight against Will Danaher. Mary Kate and the locals believe that he is a coward, but Sean actually wants to forget a fatal incident from his past and start a new life. "A Quiet Man" is a delightful romantic comedy by John Ford. The Irish Maureen O'Hara is sensational in the role of a stubborn woman that wants her dowry no matter how. John Wayne is hilarious in the role of a man that wants to forget his past and start a new life. The situations are very funny in the small Irish village and I loved when a woman gives a stick to Sean to beat the lovely lady. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "Depois do Vendaval" ("After the Windstorm")

    While I will admit that this is not the greatest film ever made, I would argue that it's one of the most entertaining. This, combined with lovely acting, nice directing from John Ford, a great script and fine location shooting make this a film you must see. On top of that, the film crosses several genres--with some fine romance, a bit of comedy and a lot of escapism. The film begins with an American (John Wayne) wandering into a small Irish town. It seems that his family was originally from there and he wants to settle there. However, from the very start, an obnoxious brute (Victor McLaglen) stands in his way to buy some property and then things heat up when Wayne begins dating McLaglen's sister (Maureen O'Hara). However, this version of John Wayne doesn't just slug McLaglen--he hates violence and is hiding a secret. What's next? See the film. Perhaps the best thing about the film is the wonderful cast of supporting characters--one of the best in Hollywood history. You have Barry Fitzgerald, Arthur Shields (Fiztgerald's real-life brother), Midred Natwick, Ward Bond and many others to provide color and a touch of the Old Country. It's thoroughly charming and sweet throughout--see this film. It's near perfection!
