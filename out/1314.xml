 <sinopse>
  A homeless man is hired as a survival guide for a group of wealthy businessmen on a hunting trip in the mountains, unaware that they are killers who hunt humans for sport, and that he is their new prey.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Mason, who lives on the streets, wants to cease his life when on the same day his two best friends die: His dog and an older man with whom he shared his food and roof. Just in time Cole, from a charity organization, can prevent his suicide and also offers him a quite well paid job as servant for a hunting party in the Rocky Mountains. Mason accepts the job and flies with them to a hut in the wilderness where they prepare everything for the four rich businessmen who want to hunt something special. Mason does not yet know that he is the victim of their sports that should lead to the basic insticts of man, but they did not count with his cleverness...

    Boy it sure has been awhile since I've done a movie review Lol, So I thought I'd do a review of an underrated old school classic action flick called Surviving The Game. In this movie Ice T plays a homeless man that gets a job as a wilderness guide for some wealthy people. But what he does not know is that he is going to be the prey. After the chase gets started he manages to put them down one by one. A great manhunt movie in a beautiful environment. Some nice twist in the plot to. This movie is a great piece of work set forth by Ernest Dickerson. The music and action sequences were great. I remember when TNT use too play this movie a lot back in the day when I was younger and I would watch it every time. This is a must watch, very old movie but it will keep you on the edge of your seat.

    I rated this G-awful turkey a 1 just to try to get its rating down to about where it belongs - a 2 or 3 at best! Unbelievable that such high caliber actors would take part in such a cinematic mess - they must have been paid well or desperate for something to do. Normally only a bunch of unknowns would act in such a turkey. The events and actions portrayed are absolute nonsense and totally unrealistic - did anyone with half a brain read the script before shooting began? Could have been much better with a better script. SPOILER: One of the biggest nonsense parts (towards the end) was how the heck did Mason (Ice_T) get back to civilization when he was stranded in the middle of nowhere AND IN ONLY 3 DAYS! Just one of the MANY ridiculous story elements. Don't waste your time with this.

    "Surviving the game" is a movie based on story that by today's standards is very clich&eacute;. It was done before (for example : "The Most dangerous game " , "The Running man") it appears today ("The Hunger games") and probably will appear in the future . It's a classic story like a bank robbery or mysterious man from nowhere saves the city . The audience already knows what to expect from this kind of movie. I'm not saying it's a bad thing . In good hands you can make a good movie from unoriginal story. "STG" is somewhere in the middle in terms of quality. There is some impressive cast for a B-class movie : Ice T (famous raper, well maybe not now , but in the past) Rutger Hauer ("Blade runner") , Charles Dutton ("Alien 3") , Gary Busey ("Lethal weapon") and F. Murray Abraham ("Amadeus") . It isn't strange to see Hauer in a B-class movie ( sadly , most of his movies are that) , but to have such interesting bunch of actors in one movie is certainly a rare treat for movie lovers . None of them shows here anything really memorable , but they did a decent job. The story is rather obvious from start to finish. Thankfully it's never boring . The movie itself is a decent popcorn flick . Not a bad way to spend your time . There is nothing you haven't seen here that wasn't done before and better . Still , I was quite entertained for hour and half , and after all I could spend my time in much more painful way watching some crap movie . I give it 5/10.

    In one of our local video store chains, if a movie was considered morally objectionable it was emblazoned with a huge yellow sticker which proclaimed that it was 'Strictly over 18's'. To me, as a youngster, this was like showing a light bulb to a moth. By the time 'Surviving the Game' was released, I was already a seasoned Ice-T and Bodycount fan and so would happily devour any of the nonsensical films which he would associate himself with (a trait which still exists to a certain degree, albeit somewhat diminished at this stage  thanks a lot 'Leprechaun In Da Hood'). Those yellow stickers never failed me; they drew me to movies such as the Tom Savini remake of Night of the Living Dead (1990), Body Melt (1993) and Bad Taste (1987). The peculiar thing about 'Surviving the Game' was that it was only classified with a 15 certificate in the UK, but as I was growing up in Ireland and they had just introduced their own film classification system (one which still prohibits the release of many, many titles today*) one can only assume that they were being extra vigilant. Such vigilance, however, was not displayed by any staff members at any of my frequented VHS rental outlets and so I was pretty much free to choose whatever I wanted and on one fine day I took the afternoon off school and retreated to my abode to wallow in some Ice-T based goodness. I regret none of those actions and this all came flooding back when I re-watched STG last week. The first thing that struck me was the plethora of character actors on show, Charles S. Dutton, Ernest R. Dickerson, F. Murray Abraham, Gary Busey, Jack Mason, John C. 'Dr Cox' McGinley and Rutger Hauer all come out in force as a group of hunters in pursuit of the deadliest game of allman. The man in question is Jack Mason (Ice-T) a man battling his demons to the extent that he has lost everything, his wife, his child, his home. Now living rough on the streets of Seattle, he even loses his best friend when his dog is run over by a careless taxi driver in the first few minutes of the movie. The altercation with the driver brings Mason to the attention of Walter Cole (Dutton), a man posing as a charity worker, but who is in reality a recruitment officer for Thomas Burns (Hauer), an entrepreneur who facilitates the immoral bloodlusts of the rich and ethically vacuous Mason is brought to Burns' offices whereupon he is offered a job (with very little details provided), he reluctantly accepts and before he knows it, he's held up in a remote cabin in the wilderness with half a dozen of the most peculiar characters you're likely to see share a dinner together. It doesn't take long before their motives are made clear and Mason is cast out on his own, given a small head start before being tracked by the hunters. Guess what? The hunters soon become the hunted and the tables get well and truly turned. OK, so it sounds dreadful and in many ways, it is. Yet, it is so enjoyably dreadful that you soon find yourself letting go and immersing yourself in Mason's plight. There is an intensity and a unique self-awareness which makes this stand out from similar movies and eventually, this makes this a remarkably endearing viewing experience. It's violent without being excessively so, it has just the right amount of humour to maintain a suspension of disbelief and by the time comeuppance is delivered, you'll be cheering along. It was refreshing to see a strong African-American lead actor at the time and whist one wouldn't go as far as to call it ground-breaking in any sense of the word, that fact is certainly notable. Ice-T is quite far removed from his hip-hop persona and suits the crusty, dreadlocked role very well. Hauer and Busey are typically and wonderfully bonkers and the support of Abraham and McGinley are both worthy additions. It was a pleasure to be reminded of a time when action movies could be so enjoyable and when character actors would partake in the movie without dominating it. Admittedly, the rush that I got for simply acquiring it wasn't there this time, but I think that was due to the lack of the yellow sticker. Read more reviews at zombiehamster.com

Ice-T does hard target, in this okay straight to video action movie. I remember it to be a lot better though when i first ever saw this. 'T' is good in his role, and has the biggest hair in the world, and you can tell the out come of the film from the beginning because of the perma-scowl 'T' wears through the majority of the movie. Hauer, Busey, and Abraham have enough swagger about hem to know that they are making this to get paid, and look like they are having a great time making the film. McGinley is the weak link to the film, due to the whining of the character throughout the whole movie. It's a faced paced movie, but takes a while to get going, but once 'T' realises what is going on, it's relentless until the silly, and what seems, re-shot ending. But if you are a fan of the Van Damme movie mentioned earlier, and nineties cheese, It's a fun movie.

    Homeless Mason (Ice-T) is taken under the wing of soup-kitchen worker Cole (Charles S. Dutton) and businessman Burns (Rutger Hauer), offered a comfortable position as a tour guide at Burns' ranch, and taken out there by private plane. Mason meets other hunters (F. Murray Abraham, Gary Busey, John C. McGinley, and William McNamara). Turns out things are good to be true, and the thing being hunted is Mason himself. A great movie. Flawless, and exactly what an action movie should be. It has you asking questions, wondering what you would do in that situation. It's a tour-de-force, with outstanding performances by everyone involved. The villains are vile and Ice-T is a great hero. The action is tight and believable. I can't endorse it enough, this is a great movie. Enjoy.

    The early nineties was a massive cross-over period for the hip-hop artist looking to solidify a lengthy career outside of the music biz. Ice-T plays a bum on the street until he crosses paths with Rutger Hauer who invites him to earn some cash out in the woods with a couple of his rich buddies. For his ignorance he's rewarded with being the pawn in a game of human hunting. But he's not nearly as easy to kill as he seems (dreadlocks) and he ends up collecting some scalps of his own en-route to a crisp finish(Toasty). The movie was a cable classic, an adventure with the likes of Gary Busey and Charles Dutton brandishing hi-caliber firearms and fast motor bikes. And guess what? You just might learn sumthin from this here, inner-city meets outer-limits tale of deception and greed. For one, never, EVER, shoot a gun you just found on the street. Clean it first. The end.

    I fell in love with this film from the first time i saw it. I'm a massive Ice-T fan and it was the first film i'd ever seen him in. I thought he was great and i was rooting for him the whole way through the story. There are a few classic scenes e.g. Gary Busey telling Ice-T how he got his birthmark, and Ice-T has a few cheesy one-liners. All this makes the movie a cult classic for me. If you liked Hard Target, you'll love Surviving The Game. Okay, Ice-T is obviously not the greatest actor, but his performance here is actually very good. It's all meant to be a bit cheesy anyway! McGinlay, Dutton and especially Busey all did well with their reasonably small roles. Hauer is, as usual, brilliant. So if you like your guns, motorbikes, fights and trees... you're in luck. 10/10

    "Surviving the Game" is a hunted in the woods action picture with numerous problems. The set up in Seattle, with Ice T being duped into becoming the hunted, takes way too long. Once in the remote wilderness, there are frequent talky moments that seem like, and are, nothing but celluloid filler. The movie becomes less and less logical as it goes along, and the conclusion is a total train wreck. A night instantly changing into day sequence on atv's is absolutely priceless. Some of the acting is acceptable, and character development is pretty good, but the film fails to impress, because eventually all logic flies out the window, and the ending is rushed and wretched. - MERK

    There is not much good to say about this movie. The pretty much only thing I remember are the nice nature pictures. Everything else about this movie is plain bad or mediocre. The dialog is stupid and ridiculous at the same time. She story is silly and uninteresting. Not even the action scenes have been acceptable. They have been poorly directed: Often illogical and all the time boring. For example, during one action scene, the night turned into day within 2 seconds. The movie felt like a complete waste of time. - It wasn't even bad enough to be funny. Avoid this movie at all costs unless you are a fan of brain dead action movies.

McGinlay, Dutton and especially Busey all did well with their reasonably small roles. Hauer is, as usual, brilliant. So if you like your guns, motorbikes, fights and trees... you're in luck. 10/10

    "Surviving the Game" is a hunted in the woods action picture with numerous problems. The set up in Seattle, with Ice T being duped into becoming the hunted, takes way too long. Once in the remote wilderness, there are frequent talky moments that seem like, and are, nothing but celluloid filler. The movie becomes less and less logical as it goes along, and the conclusion is a total train wreck. A night instantly changing into day sequence on atv's is absolutely priceless. Some of the acting is acceptable, and character development is pretty good, but the film fails to impress, because eventually all logic flies out the window, and the ending is rushed and wretched. - MERK

    There is not much good to say about this movie. The pretty much only thing I remember are the nice nature pictures. Everything else about this movie is plain bad or mediocre. The dialog is stupid and ridiculous at the same time. She story is silly and uninteresting. Not even the action scenes have been acceptable. They have been poorly directed: Often illogical and all the time boring. For example, during one action scene, the night turned into day within 2 seconds. The movie felt like a complete waste of time. - It wasn't even bad enough to be funny. Avoid this movie at all costs unless you are a fan of brain dead action movies.

    Boy it sure has been awhile since I've done a movie review Lol, So I thought I'd do a review of an underrated old school classic action flick called Surviving The Game. In this movie Ice T plays a homeless man that gets a job as a wilderness guide for some wealthy people. But what he does not know is that he is going to be the prey. After the chase gets started he manages to put them down one by one. A great manhunt movie in a beautiful environment. Some nice twist in the plot to. This movie is a great piece of work set forth by Ernest Dickerson. The music and action sequences were great. I remember when TNT use too play this movie a lot back in the day when I was younger and I would watch it every time. This is a must watch, very old movie but it will keep you on the edge of your seat.

    I rated this G-awful turkey a 1 just to try to get its rating down to about where it belongs - a 2 or 3 at best! Unbelievable that such high caliber actors would take part in such a cinematic mess - they must have been paid well or desperate for something to do. Normally only a bunch of unknowns would act in such a turkey. The events and actions portrayed are absolute nonsense and totally unrealistic - did anyone with half a brain read the script before shooting began? Could have been much better with a better script. SPOILER: One of the biggest nonsense parts (towards the end) was how the heck did Mason (Ice_T) get back to civilization when he was stranded in the middle of nowhere AND IN ONLY 3 DAYS! Just one of the MANY ridiculous story elements. Don't waste your time with this.

    "Surviving the game" is a movie based on story that by today's standards is very clich&eacute;. It was done before (for example : "The Most dangerous game " , "The Running man") it appears today ("The Hunger games") and probably will appear in the future . It's a classic story like a bank robbery or mysterious man from nowhere saves the city . The audience already knows what to expect from this kind of movie. I'm not saying it's a bad thing . In good hands you can make a good movie from unoriginal story. "STG" is somewhere in the middle in terms of quality. There is some impressive cast for a B-class movie : Ice T (famous raper, well maybe not now , but in the past) Rutger Hauer ("Blade runner") , Charles Dutton ("Alien 3") , Gary Busey ("Lethal weapon") and F. Murray Abraham ("Amadeus") . It isn't strange to see Hauer in a B-class movie ( sadly , most of his movies are that) , but to have such interesting bunch of actors in one movie is certainly a rare treat for movie lovers . None of them shows here anything really memorable , but they did a decent job. The story is rather obvious from start to finish. Thankfully it's never boring . The movie itself is a decent popcorn flick . Not a bad way to spend your time . There is nothing you haven't seen here that wasn't done before and better . Still , I was quite entertained for hour and half , and after all I could spend my time in much more painful way watching some crap movie . I give it 5/10.

    In one of our local video store chains, if a movie was considered morally objectionable it was emblazoned with a huge yellow sticker which proclaimed that it was 'Strictly over 18's'. To me, as a youngster, this was like showing a light bulb to a moth. By the time 'Surviving the Game' was released, I was already a seasoned Ice-T and Bodycount fan and so would happily devour any of the nonsensical films which he would associate himself with (a trait which still exists to a certain degree, albeit somewhat diminished at this stage  thanks a lot 'Leprechaun In Da Hood'). Those yellow stickers never failed me; they drew me to movies such as the Tom Savini remake of Night of the Living Dead (1990), Body Melt (1993) and Bad Taste (1987). The peculiar thing about 'Surviving the Game' was that it was only classified with a 15 certificate in the UK, but as I was growing up in Ireland and they had just introduced their own film classification system (one which still prohibits the release of many, many titles today*) one can only assume that they were being extra vigilant. Such vigilance, however, was not displayed by any staff members at any of my frequented VHS rental outlets and so I was pretty much free to choose whatever I wanted and on one fine day I took the afternoon off school and retreated to my abode to wallow in some Ice-T based goodness. I regret none of those actions and this all came flooding back when I re-watched STG last week. The first thing that struck me was the plethora of character actors on show, Charles S. Dutton, Ernest R. Dickerson, F. Murray Abraham, Gary Busey, Jack Mason, John C. 'Dr Cox' McGinley and Rutger Hauer all come out in force as a group of hunters in pursuit of the deadliest game of allman. The man in question is Jack Mason (Ice-T) a man battling his demons to the extent that he has lost everything, his wife, his child, his home. Now living rough on the streets of Seattle, he even loses his best friend when his dog is run over by a careless taxi driver in the first few minutes of the movie. The altercation with the driver brings Mason to the attention of Walter Cole (Dutton), a man posing as a charity worker, but who is in reality a recruitment officer for Thomas Burns (Hauer), an entrepreneur who facilitates the immoral bloodlusts of the rich and ethically vacuous Mason is brought to Burns' offices whereupon he is offered a job (with very little details provided), he reluctantly accepts and before he knows it, he's held up in a remote cabin in the wilderness with half a dozen of the most peculiar characters you're likely to see share a dinner together. It doesn't take long before their motives are made clear and Mason is cast out on his own, given a small head start before being tracked by the hunters. Guess what? The hunters soon become the hunted and the tables get well and truly turned. OK, so it sounds dreadful and in many ways, it is. Yet, it is so enjoyably dreadful that you soon find yourself letting go and immersing yourself in Mason's plight. There is an intensity and a unique self-awareness which makes this stand out from similar movies and eventually, this makes this a remarkably endearing viewing experience. It's violent without being excessively so, it has just the right amount of humour to maintain a suspension of disbelief and by the time comeuppance is delivered, you'll be cheering along. It was refreshing to see a strong African-American lead actor at the time and whist one wouldn't go as far as to call it ground-breaking in any sense of the word, that fact is certainly notable. Ice-T is quite far removed from his hip-hop persona and suits the crusty, dreadlocked role very well. Hauer and Busey are typically and wonderfully bonkers and the support of Abraham and McGinley are both worthy additions. It was a pleasure to be reminded of a time when action movies could be so enjoyable and when character actors would partake in the movie without dominating it. Admittedly, the rush that I got for simply acquiring it wasn't there this time, but I think that was due to the lack of the yellow sticker. Read more reviews at zombiehamster.com

    Mason, who lives on the streets, wants to cease his life when on the same day his two best friends die: His dog and an older man with whom he shared his food and roof. Just in time Cole, from a charity organisation, can prevent his suicide and also offers him a quite well paid job as servant for a hunting party in the Rocky Mountains. Mason accepts the job and flies with them to a hut in the wilderness where they prepare everything for the four rich businessmen who want to hunt something special. Mason does not yet know that he is the victim of their sports that should lead to the basic instincts of man, but they did not count with his cleverness... Ice-T does hard target, in this okay straight to video action movie. I remember it to be a lot better though when i first ever saw this. 'T' is good in his role, and has the biggest hair in the world, and you can tell the out come of the film from the beginning because of the perma-scowl 'T' wears through the majority of the movie. Hauer, Busey, and Abraham have enough swagger about hem to know that they are making this to get paid, and look like they are having a great time making the film. McGinley is the weak link to the film, due to the whining of the character throughout the whole movie. It's a faced paced movie, but takes a while to get going, but once 'T' realises what is going on, it's relentless until the silly, and what seems, re-shot ending. But if you are a fan of the Van Damme movie mentioned earlier, and nineties cheese, It's a fun movie.

    Homeless Mason (Ice-T) is taken under the wing of soup-kitchen worker Cole (Charles S. Dutton) and businessman Burns (Rutger Hauer), offered a comfortable position as a tour guide at Burns' ranch, and taken out there by private plane. Mason meets other hunters (F. Murray Abraham, Gary Busey, John C. McGinley, and William McNamara). Turns out things are good to be true, and the thing being hunted is Mason himself. A great movie. Flawless, and exactly what an action movie should be. It has you asking questions, wondering what you would do in that situation. It's a tour-de-force, with outstanding performances by everyone involved. The villains are vile and Ice-T is a great hero. The action is tight and believable. I can't endorse it enough, this is a great movie. Enjoy.

    The early nineties was a massive cross-over period for the hip-hop artist looking to solidify a lengthy career outside of the music biz. Ice-T plays a bum on the street until he crosses paths with Rutger Hauer who invites him to earn some cash out in the woods with a couple of his rich buddies. For his ignorance he's rewarded with being the pawn in a game of human hunting. But he's not nearly as easy to kill as he seems (dreadlocks) and he ends up collecting some scalps of his own en-route to a crisp finish(Toasty). The movie was a cable classic, an adventure with the likes of Gary Busey and Charles Dutton brandishing hi-caliber firearms and fast motor bikes. And guess what? You just might learn sumthin from this here, inner-city meets outer-limits tale of deception and greed. For one, never, EVER, shoot a gun you just found on the street. Clean it first. The end.

If you liked Hard Target, you'll love Surviving The Game. Okay, Ice-T is obviously not the greatest actor, but his performance here is actually very good. It's all meant to be a bit cheesy anyway! McGinlay, Dutton and especially Busey all did well with their reasonably small roles. Hauer is, as usual, brilliant. So if you like your guns, motorbikes, fights and trees... you're in luck. 10/10

    "Surviving the Game" is a hunted in the woods action picture with numerous problems. The set up in Seattle, with Ice T being duped into becoming the hunted, takes way too long. Once in the remote wilderness, there are frequent talky moments that seem like, and are, nothing but celluloid filler. The movie becomes less and less logical as it goes along, and the conclusion is a total train wreck. A night instantly changing into day sequence on atv's is absolutely priceless. Some of the acting is acceptable, and character development is pretty good, but the film fails to impress, because eventually all logic flies out the window, and the ending is rushed and wretched. - MERK

    There is not much good to say about this movie. The pretty much only thing I remember are the nice nature pictures. Everything else about this movie is plain bad or mediocre. The dialog is stupid and ridiculous at the same time. She story is silly and uninteresting. Not even the action scenes have been acceptable. They have been poorly directed: Often illogical and all the time boring. For example, during one action scene, the night turned into day within 2 seconds. The movie felt like a complete waste of time. - It wasn't even bad enough to be funny. Avoid this movie at all costs unless you are a fan of brain dead action movies.

    Boy it sure has been awhile since I've done a movie review Lol, So I thought I'd do a review of an underrated old school classic action flick called Surviving The Game. In this movie Ice T plays a homeless man that gets a job as a wilderness guide for some wealthy people. But what he does not know is that he is going to be the prey. After the chase gets started he manages to put them down one by one. A great manhunt movie in a beautiful environment. Some nice twist in the plot to. This movie is a great piece of work set forth by Ernest Dickerson. The music and action sequences were great. I remember when TNT use too play this movie a lot back in the day when I was younger and I would watch it every time. This is a must watch, very old movie but it will keep you on the edge of your seat.

    I rated this G-awful turkey a 1 just to try to get its rating down to about where it belongs - a 2 or 3 at best! Unbelievable that such high caliber actors would take part in such a cinematic mess - they must have been paid well or desperate for something to do. Normally only a bunch of unknowns would act in such a turkey. The events and actions portrayed are absolute nonsense and totally unrealistic - did anyone with half a brain read the script before shooting began? Could have been much better with a better script. SPOILER: One of the biggest nonsense parts (towards the end) was how the heck did Mason (Ice_T) get back to civilization when he was stranded in the middle of nowhere AND IN ONLY 3 DAYS! Just one of the MANY ridiculous story elements. Don't waste your time with this.

    "Surviving the game" is a movie based on story that by today's standards is very clich&eacute;. It was done before (for example : "The Most dangerous game " , "The Running man") it appears today ("The Hunger games") and probably will appear in the future . It's a classic story like a bank robbery or mysterious man from nowhere saves the city . The audience already knows what to expect from this kind of movie. I'm not saying it's a bad thing . In good hands you can make a good movie from unoriginal story. "STG" is somewhere in the middle in terms of quality. There is some impressive cast for a B-class movie : Ice T (famous raper, well maybe not now , but in the past) Rutger Hauer ("Blade runner") , Charles Dutton ("Alien 3") , Gary Busey ("Lethal weapon") and F. Murray Abraham ("Amadeus") . It isn't strange to see Hauer in a B-class movie ( sadly , most of his movies are that) , but to have such interesting bunch of actors in one movie is certainly a rare treat for movie lovers . None of them shows here anything really memorable , but they did a decent job. The story is rather obvious from start to finish. Thankfully it's never boring . The movie itself is a decent popcorn flick . Not a bad way to spend your time . There is nothing you haven't seen here that wasn't done before and better . Still , I was quite entertained for hour and half , and after all I could spend my time in much more painful way watching some crap movie . I give it 5/10.

    In one of our local video store chains, if a movie was considered morally objectionable it was emblazoned with a huge yellow sticker which proclaimed that it was 'Strictly over 18's'. To me, as a youngster, this was like showing a light bulb to a moth. By the time 'Surviving the Game' was released, I was already a seasoned Ice-T and Bodycount fan and so would happily devour any of the nonsensical films which he would associate himself with (a trait which still exists to a certain degree, albeit somewhat diminished at this stage  thanks a lot 'Leprechaun In Da Hood'). Those yellow stickers never failed me; they drew me to movies such as the Tom Savini remake of Night of the Living Dead (1990), Body Melt (1993) and Bad Taste (1987). The peculiar thing about 'Surviving the Game' was that it was only classified with a 15 certificate in the UK, but as I was growing up in Ireland and they had just introduced their own film classification system (one which still prohibits the release of many, many titles today*) one can only assume that they were being extra vigilant. Such vigilance, however, was not displayed by any staff members at any of my frequented VHS rental outlets and so I was pretty much free to choose whatever I wanted and on one fine day I took the afternoon off school and retreated to my abode to wallow in some Ice-T based goodness. I regret none of those actions and this all came flooding back when I re-watched STG last week. The first thing that struck me was the plethora of character actors on show, Charles S. Dutton, Ernest R. Dickerson, F. Murray Abraham, Gary Busey, Jack Mason, John C. 'Dr Cox' McGinley and Rutger Hauer all come out in force as a group of hunters in pursuit of the deadliest game of allman. The man in question is Jack Mason (Ice-T) a man battling his demons to the extent that he has lost everything, his wife, his child, his home. Now living rough on the streets of Seattle, he even loses his best friend when his dog is run over by a careless taxi driver in the first few minutes of the movie. The altercation with the driver brings Mason to the attention of Walter Cole (Dutton), a man posing as a charity worker, but who is in reality a recruitment officer for Thomas Burns (Hauer), an entrepreneur who facilitates the immoral bloodlusts of the rich and ethically vacuous Mason is brought to Burns' offices whereupon he is offered a job (with very little details provided), he reluctantly accepts and before he knows it, he's held up in a remote cabin in the wilderness with half a dozen of the most peculiar characters you're likely to see share a dinner together. It doesn't take long before their motives are made clear and Mason is cast out on his own, given a small head start before being tracked by the hunters. Guess what? The hunters soon become the hunted and the tables get well and truly turned. OK, so it sounds dreadful and in many ways, it is. Yet, it is so enjoyably dreadful that you soon find yourself letting go and immersing yourself in Mason's plight. There is an intensity and a unique self-awareness which makes this stand out from similar movies and eventually, this makes this a remarkably endearing viewing experience. It's violent without being excessively so, it has just the right amount of humour to maintain a suspension of disbelief and by the time comeuppance is delivered, you'll be cheering along. It was refreshing to see a strong African-American lead actor at the time and whist one wouldn't go as far as to call it ground-breaking in any sense of the word, that fact is certainly notable. Ice-T is quite far removed from his hip-hop persona and suits the crusty, dreadlocked role very well. Hauer and Busey are typically and wonderfully bonkers and the support of Abraham and McGinley are both worthy additions. It was a pleasure to be reminded of a time when action movies could be so enjoyable and when character actors would partake in the movie without dominating it. Admittedly, the rush that I got for simply acquiring it wasn't there this time, but I think that was due to the lack of the yellow sticker. Read more reviews at zombiehamster.com

    Mason, who lives on the streets, wants to cease his life when on the same day his two best friends die: His dog and an older man with whom he shared his food and roof. Just in time Cole, from a charity organisation, can prevent his suicide and also offers him a quite well paid job as servant for a hunting party in the Rocky Mountains. Mason accepts the job and flies with them to a hut in the wilderness where they prepare everything for the four rich businessmen who want to hunt something special. Mason does not yet know that he is the victim of their sports that should lead to the basic instincts of man, but they did not count with his cleverness... Ice-T does hard target, in this okay straight to video action movie. I remember it to be a lot better though when i first ever saw this. 'T' is good in his role, and has the biggest hair in the world, and you can tell the out come of the film from the beginning because of the perma-scowl 'T' wears through the majority of the movie. Hauer, Busey, and Abraham have enough swagger about hem to know that they are making this to get paid, and look like they are having a great time making the film. McGinley is the weak link to the film, due to the whining of the character throughout the whole movie. It's a faced paced movie, but takes a while to get going, but once 'T' realises what is going on, it's relentless until the silly, and what seems, re-shot ending. But if you are a fan of the Van Damme movie mentioned earlier, and nineties cheese, It's a fun movie.

    Homeless Mason (Ice-T) is taken under the wing of soup-kitchen worker Cole (Charles S. Dutton) and businessman Burns (Rutger Hauer), offered a comfortable position as a tour guide at Burns' ranch, and taken out there by private plane. Mason meets other hunters (F. Murray Abraham, Gary Busey, John C. McGinley, and William McNamara). Turns out things are good to be true, and the thing being hunted is Mason himself. A great movie. Flawless, and exactly what an action movie should be. It has you asking questions, wondering what you would do in that situation. It's a tour-de-force, with outstanding performances by everyone involved. The villains are vile and Ice-T is a great hero. The action is tight and believable. I can't endorse it enough, this is a great movie. Enjoy.

    The early nineties was a massive cross-over period for the hip-hop artist looking to solidify a lengthy career outside of the music biz. Ice-T plays a bum on the street until he crosses paths with Rutger Hauer who invites him to earn some cash out in the woods with a couple of his rich buddies. For his ignorance he's rewarded with being the pawn in a game of human hunting. But he's not nearly as easy to kill as he seems (dreadlocks) and he ends up collecting some scalps of his own en-route to a crisp finish(Toasty). The movie was a cable classic, an adventure with the likes of Gary Busey and Charles Dutton brandishing hi-caliber firearms and fast motor bikes. And guess what? You just might learn sumthin from this here, inner-city meets outer-limits tale of deception and greed. For one, never, EVER, shoot a gun you just found on the street. Clean it first. The end.

If you liked Hard Target, you'll love Surviving The Game. Okay, Ice-T is obviously not the greatest actor, but his performance here is actually very good. It's all meant to be a bit cheesy anyway! McGinlay, Dutton and especially Busey all did well with their reasonably small roles. Hauer is, as usual, brilliant. So if you like your guns, motorbikes, fights and trees... you're in luck. 10/10

    "Surviving the Game" is a hunted in the woods action picture with numerous problems. The set up in Seattle, with Ice T being duped into becoming the hunted, takes way too long. Once in the remote wilderness, there are frequent talky moments that seem like, and are, nothing but celluloid filler. The movie becomes less and less logical as it goes along, and the conclusion is a total train wreck. A night instantly changing into day sequence on atv's is absolutely priceless. Some of the acting is acceptable, and character development is pretty good, but the film fails to impress, because eventually all logic flies out the window, and the ending is rushed and wretched. - MERK

    There is not much good to say about this movie. The pretty much only thing I remember are the nice nature pictures. Everything else about this movie is plain bad or mediocre. The dialog is stupid and ridiculous at the same time. She story is silly and uninteresting. Not even the action scenes have been acceptable. They have been poorly directed: Often illogical and all the time boring. For example, during one action scene, the night turned into day within 2 seconds. The movie felt like a complete waste of time. - It wasn't even bad enough to be funny. Avoid this movie at all costs unless you are a fan of brain dead action movies.
