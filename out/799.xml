It is via this guy that she realizes that she could settle down for herself and her son (do caprio). As an when their lives get intertwined, di caprio faces angst from deniro and tries to get a future for himself out of the small town. This is his struggle to learn, to get a direction and to survive! Follow Tobias Wolff's memoir into his journey beyond the brutality and the hopelessness. For all the depth, I give this movie an 8 on 10

    Wow. This was a harsh film, but a damn good one at that. What is more amazing about this movie is that it is based on the memoirs of the real Tobias Wolf! It's a true story, and that made it all the more better while viewing this one. I cannot state how unpleasant this movie can be at times. The stuff Jack (Tobias) has to endure is really heart wrenching, and there were a few moments where I actually gasped out loud. It's not very often a movie can grip me with complete astonishment, but this managed to do just that. I give a lot of credit to the ensemble performances. Leo DiCaprio is astonishing for a kid at his age at this juncture. He is solely responsible for taking me on a journey I won't soon forget. He is sympathetic, very vulnerable, and I was able to empathize with him all the way. You will feel desperation when it comes to some of his scenes. Robert DeNiro plays one of the most brazen, and detestable characters I have ever seen. He is often terrifying as Dwight. DeNiro is credited for many amazing roles and rightfully so, but this one is shockingly neglected a lot of the time when it comes to his resume. What a chilling performance! Ellen Barkin is exceptionally good as the clueless, yet likable Mother. She may make you wanna slap her one at times, but you'll lover her for the most part, i'm sure. Eliza Dushku, Tobey Maguire, among others have small roles here. Final Thoughts: It's a hard film to review without revealing so much. It's a fantastic, if draining experience. If you're in the mood for an excellent heavy drama, I would choose this one without question. It'll stay with you after it is over 9/10

    Moving adaptation of Tobias Wolff's memoir. Leonardo DiCaprio, in the same year he became a break-out star for What's Eating Gilbert Grape, stars as Wolff, a teenager who moves all around the country with his mother (Ellen Barkin). They finally settle down in Concrete, Washington when Barkin falls for a mechanic (Robert De Niro). After the two marry, De Niro quickly reveals his true colors: he's a petulant, petty jerk. In particular, he treats DiCaprio like total crap. He has three kids of his own (including a young Carla Gugino and Eliza Dushku), and he treats them well enough, but he feels jealous of DiCaprio. He's severely emotionally abusive toward him and even physically so when pushed. DiCaprio, who isn't exactly a good kid, gets his life straighter, seemingly just to spite his stepfather. DiCaprio was quite good in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but, for my money, his talent shines through here much more in a less showy role. I think most people have known a guy just like De Niro's character, and he's very good here. Barkin is also quite good. Jonah Blechman is also very good as DiCaprio's gay buddy. Tobey Maguire appears in his first credited role.

    Tobias (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his mother Caroline (Ellen Barkin) are at loose ends after Caroline's divorce. Caroline has the get rich scheme of heading for uranium mining out west. After this and other other ideas fail, Caroline and Tobias wind up in Concrete, Washington (yes, it actually exists) where they are getting desperate. In steps Dwight, a local mechanic. Dwight seems sincere in his courting of Caroline and, since he offers stability and security, Caroline is willing to buy what he is offering by marrying him. After the marriage Dwight's dark side surfaces in the major conflict that develops between him and Tobias. Tobias is no angel, but to me his behavior was no more out of line than that of your typical rebellious youth, whereas Dwight's tyrannical behavior struck me as bordering on the sadistic. The scenes of physical abuse I found hard to watch. Why Dwight's reaction to Tobias is so extreme is open to speculation. In part I think it comes from Dwight's perception of what it means to be a man--you are the ultimate authority, one who brooks no opposition. Expanding on that theme, Dwight senses that Tobias is not living up to his stereotypical image, for example Tobias likes to read books of all things. In some ways I got the feeling that Dwight's behavior was not all malicious; some small part of him felt for Tobias and he was trying to impose his vision on him as how to deal with the world. However, there is one pivotal scene that said a lot about Dwight to me. While Dwight and Tobias were watching television a news report came on about Lana Turner's daughter Cheryl Crane murdering Turner's boyfriend Johnny Stompanato, on the grounds that he was brutalizing her mother. Crane was acquitted on the grounds of justifiable homicide. When that last piece of information was mentioned, Dwight looked over at Tobias (who was paying intense attention to the program) with a look that said, "Hmmmm, could this apply to me?" This indicated to me that Dwight knew he had gone over the line in his dealings with Tobias and maybe would pay the ultimate price. The movie takes place in the late 1950s and period details are inserted in order to make that point: cars, hair styles, clothes, TV, movies, music. De Niro is good here--I think you have to be a good actor to play such a thoroughly unlikeable bully as Dwight with such convincing realism. It is no small treat to see De Niro dressed in a scout uniform. Barkin is fine, but Caroline moves to deep background once the major struggle between Dwight and Tobias takes center stage. DiCaprio turns in a particularly good performance, being able to hold his own against two experienced actors. This is billed as a true story, being an accounting of author Tobias Wollf's experiences. I think this should more appropriately be labeled as based on truth, since there are some things that don't ring quite true. For example, the scene that has Tobias running a table saw in shop class at school is wrong. Not even the most inexperienced novice in a wood class would be passing the wood through the saw in the dangerous way that Tobias was. I was cringing just to watch it. And the injury we see he sustains could in no way be caused by the accident as pictured, at the least it would have been more serious. And there was no purpose to what he was doing with the saw to start with. After seeing this I wondered just how well the rest of the movie had been researched. To say that something is a true story is risky--not even most documentaries are without bias. What an author says in an autobiographical text has to be taken with some reservations as to the truth I am left wanting to read the book, since I am sure the relationships are more complicated than what can be presented here in two hours. We don't get to know Caroline very well, and how Dwight's kids from a previous marriage fit into the family is hardly treated. In particular I wanted to know more about Dwight's relationship with the other kids, especially with his son. More details on Tobias' relationship with the effeminate Arthur would be interesting--how did he square that relationship with his other tough friends? Was Arthur as stereotypically gay as shown? Overall I found this to be well acted and absorbing. It reminds me of the father/son battle waged in the 1979 movie, "The Great Santini."

    "You'll never forget me!" shouts an angry Dwight to Tobias and his mother when they're finally leaving the house of so many haunting memories. That's probably the only true thing he ever said, and the proof is, Tobias Wolff, the author wrote a novel about the Dwight years, adapted in 1993 by Michael Caton-Jones. And I remember having seen the film many years ago, before "Titanic", before all Leonardo Di Caprio's adult roles, I didn't forget Dwight, played by De Niro, but I didn't forget Leo either. "This Boy's Life" is the chronicle of Tobias Wolff's teenage days, when his nomadic mother, played by the a sensual Ellen Barkin, decided to go west, the land of greener grasses. She looks for a job, a roof, a school for her boy, but marrying a man would provide everything she needs in once, and a fatherly figure, an extra Tobias severely needs. Finally, in a small town, conveniently named 'Concrete', she meets Dwight, a divorced father with three children, whose gallantry and gentleness don't fool Tobias. His suspicions are immediately confirmed when Dwight confronts him in the car and dares him to ever try to mock him. The character is set, and De Niro here plays one of his most underrated and memorable villainous roles as a bully so blinded by his inferiority complex he doesn't realize he's only venting his anger on Tobias. De Niro maintains a puzzling mix of genuine authority or pathetic craziness that we're never quite sure about his intentions, and even the mother, while feeling the aggressiveness, still believes he can be a model for Tobias. Naturally, as the movie progresses, Dwight's actions get more and more explicit about how cruel and abusive he is, each of his seemingly good actions are followed by a treachery. He encourages Tobias to deliver newspapers yet he steals his money, he buys him a dog, but sells his Winchester to get the money, he registers him to the scout but can't buy him a proper suit, or shoes to play baskets, he teaches him to fight yet only seems to enjoy his towering position to humiliate him. All the film is a succession of conflictual situations between Dwight and Toby, and as soon as De Niro emerges on screen, Barkin dissolves in his shadow. Less than an underusing, it illustrates the fact that she accepts her fate, and choose a neutral position: she doesn't want to be the 'umpire', a wise move that probably avoids an aggravation, since she also endures Dwight complex in bed and makes her only involvement more significant and crucial to the story, which ends in the most cheerful way. Dwight is a dark and unforgettable parenthesis in Tobias' life that marked him forever. We can feel it by the level of emotion displayed by Tobis when he finally escaped from him, yet at this moment, we can't help but feel sorry for De Niro, who as douche-bag as he was, couldn't hide his vulnerability and an obvious insecurity. Only an actor like De Niro could have inspired so many contradictory reactions  and I guess a part of the credit is to the directing, and the storytelling. "This Boy's Life" features many difficult parts, the injustice, the bullying, starting with the most random things like toothpaste, mustard, and it's so futile that you can't doubt that it's true, but it doesn't overdo the pathos, and even translates it into comedy. When De Niro and Leo take the picture in the scout camp, you can't help but smile at the discomposure in Toby's face with De Niro's trademark grin. And the 'comedy' aspect also relies on Toby's capability to resist Dwight's pressure, sometimes he accepts it, he does in the beginning, but as he gets older and grows more rebel, he responds to him, even laugh at him, almost not realizing that he's being influenced by him. On that level, the film features many other subplots, involving a friendship with Arthur Gayle, an ambiguously homosexual who seems infatuated on Toby, and later, he has the feeling that it's Dwight's voice speaking in him, and Toby realizes he might have been molded the worst way, with the only choice being becoming Dwight or like his losers friends. His only chance of escape is to apply for prep schools with the help of Arthur to get the teacher's favors. The conflict between Dwight and Toby is the core of the film, and no matter how powerful is De Niro, Leo is capable to steal the show, to take him face to face, and when a young snotty punk like him can take it from the guy who was already a legend you know there's something promising in this talent. And it's no wonder that Leo was nominated the same year for 'Gilbert Grape'. In my recent reviews, I've been very critical toward Leonardo Di Caprio especially the way he was typecast as a macho tough lead, while there was more to exploit in his angelic face. That's true, I've never bought him as a tough guy, maybe because I didn't want to, maybe because I thought there was a lot of potential wasted, he could have more interesting roles. "The Aviator" was my favorite of his 'recent' roles and I'm still waiting to see "Django Unchained", till that day, all I can do is revisit his performance and "This Boy's Life", and the unforgettable breakdown part, his shout in the mountains finally exorcising the deliverance of getting rid of Dwight, such a communicative moment, or his Eddie Cochran in the car (the scene I remembered the most&agrave;) and put my unfair bias into perspective.

    As time goes by, I'm starting to realize how much of a talent Di Caprio was in his youth. I wonder what went wrong... I also ponder upon a question why movies like "This Boy's Life" don't hit the big screen anymore? When did film making become a shallow business with it's only interest in profits. "This Boy's Life" is anything but a classic Hollywood blockbuster. It's a slice of life presented both in it's best and worst. And life is not like a film either... Being young, smart and trapped in a behindhand environment is tough, often frustrating and inhibiting. It's a first major battle in a war called survival, a battle that would set a young man on it's way and pave the road to his future. Being alone in such a struggle is not easy, and young Toby Wolff would feel it on his skin quite some. Well, maybe not completely alone. Toby's mother tries hard to soldier on in life, and yet, she lacks the energy and will to make that final push. In the absence of a father figure, fourteen year old Tobias endeavors to model himself on his own, fighting not only his inner demons, but also a harsh, inert and primitive surrounding portrayed in the character of Dwigh and the village of Concrete. Will he succeed and break away? It's all in his hands... The entire cast made a remarkable job - Di Caprio for one, followed by Ellen Barkin and Robert De Niro, as well as rest of the team. A tribute would also deservedly go to all of the technical crew, scriptwriter and director. Even without the real-life reference at the end, it's quite obvious this story was written by life itself, which makes it that special and unique. "This Boy's Life" is a good story well portrayed, and as such it rightfully earns it's 10 points. More flicks like this, please! This also presents a small jubilee, since it is my 50th review here on IMDb (including the needlessly removed one). Cheers!

    The story about the relationship between a rebellious 50s teenager and his abusive father, based on the memoirs of writer and literature professor Tobias Wolff. This Boy's Life is incredible, it is absolutely incredibly, it is a powerful an incredibly movie drama that benefits from great directing and powerful performances. I was really surprised at how great this movie was, I was expecting it to be a good movie, but I wasn't expecting it to be a "great" movie, and it is a great movie, it really and truly is. I honestly believe that this is one of the best movies of the last 25 years, it really is that powerful of a movie, it is powerful, touching, moving, and there are a few parts that just might leave you with some tears in your eyes. This Boy's Life is a movie that you will probably have to watch more than once just because of how great it is. If you want to see how great a movie can get, then watch this movie, because it will show you just how great a movie can get. I love this movie, it's honestly one of the best movies that I've seen in a very long time. Let's talk about some of the acting, shall we? Yes lets. In one of his major breakthrough roles, Leonardo DiCaprio gives a marvelous performance as the main character, who suffers a torrent of verbal, emotional, and physical abuse at the hands of his monster of a stepfather, played by the always fabulous Robert De Niro. I also liked the performance of Jonah Blechman, who plays Arthur Gayle, a person who DiCaprio's character doesn't get along with at first, but eventually becomes good friends with. Robert De Niro's performance as the horrid stepfather is a great one, but while he was great, Leonardo DiCaprio gets the most praise from me, for being a young adult at the time he made this movie, he was certainly phenomenal in the role he played. To make an extremely long story short, everyone who starred in this movie did a great job, especially Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. In short, This Boy's Life is one of the best movies that I've seen in a very, very, very long time, it's spectacular, marvelous, fabulous, and unforgettable. I expected De Niro to be good in this movie, as I absolutely adore the man, but I didn't like the movie just because he was in it, I liked it for a lot of other reason as well, such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Blechman. If you haven't seen this movie, then you've got to see it, because there is an extremely high chance that you will love it. You will laugh, you will cry, you will cheer, you will be thrilled with what you will watch. This Boy's Life is a movie that will last, it will never grow old, it will remain a great movie until the end of time, it is not only one of the best I've seen, but it is also one of the best of both Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. So if you haven't seen this movie yet, then watch it, because the chances are you will really, really, really enjoy it. 10/10

    I read the book so many times. Even knew there was a movie about it I had read and re read the book. I loved Tobias Wolff's writing. I think a major reason I didn't like it was because the book had so much to offer. It felt as though there wasn't enough depth in the movie. The movie was good no doubt. I am not a fan of Leonardo Di caprio. However, he did do a good job in this movie. I could think of no one better who could play the role of father as well as Robert De Niro did... Overall it was good and I wouldn't mind watching it again. Though I would prefer reading it again a lot more. Which is a lot for me to say because I do prefer movies a lot more than books. (sorry)

    A single mother and her difficult son find family life isn't necessarily all it's cracked up to be in this film.This Boy's Life is a film adaptation of the memoir of the same name by Tobias Wolff. It is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and it features Leonardo DiCaprio as Tobias Wolff together with Robert De Niro and Ellen Barkin. The film also co-stars Chris Cooper,Carla Gugino,Eliza Dushku and Tobey Maguire in a small role. Nomadic, flaky Caroline just wants to settle down in one place, find a decent guy, and provide a better home for her handful of a son, Toby. When she moves to Seattle and meets the respectful, respectable Dwight Hansen, she thinks she's got it made. Toby, however, feels differently after spending a few months with Dwight and his children and away from Caroline. The boy's stepfather-to-be seems to want to mold Toby into a better person, but to do so he emotionally, verbally, and physically abuses the kid. The marriage proceeds, and soon Caroline, too, recognizes Dwight's need to dominate everyone around him. She sticks with it, though, convinced it's the best thing for her son, and several years of dysfunction ensue. During this time, Tobias befriends another misfit, the possibly homosexual young Arthur Gayle, while continuing to chafe under the yoke of his repressive stepfather.Hoping to leave Concrete and live with his older brother Gregory, Toby decides to apply for east-coast prep-school scholarships. Realizing his grades are not adequate to apply, Toby devises a plan to submit falsified grade reports. Meanwhile, the friendship between Arthur and Toby becomes strained when Arthur confronts Toby regarding his behavior; Arthur tells Toby he is acting more and more like Dwight and asks Toby, "why should you be the one who gets to leave?" Even so, Arthur helps his friend get the papers Toby needs to falsify his grade records and Toby sends in his prep-school applications. When Toby tells Arthur he can leave Concrete and have a better life too, Arthur tells him he will most likely stay. After numerous rejections, Toby is accepted to the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania with a full scholarship.At the end of the film following two years of marriage, Caroline defends Toby during a physically violent argument between her son and husband and they are both seen leaving Dwight and Concrete. This movie provided the first lead role for future superstar Leonardo DiCaprio. He steals the show in this tale of learning how to be a man, with a sly Robert De Niro also giving a good performance.It was a a compelling character study that is well worth watching despite of being too long and a plot that drags.It shows how a resilient teenager survives childhood trauma and adversity through independence, anger and creativity.In short,it is a powerful and compelling stuff that makes it a must-see.

    This Boys Life A Review by Ashley "I SEE YOUR SPOTS LEOPARD!" If I were to explain to you what this movie is actually about it would really put you off. It could make you not even want to see the movie. That being said, this movie is a total gem! It was a boring, hot, sunny afternoon and there was absolutely nothing to watch on television. I was literally flipping through channels when somewhere along the line I decided that a slow paced, uncomfortable, movie about child abuse on Showcase would do. I soon realized that the child being abused was Leonardo DiCaprio and the person doing the abusing was none other than Robert De Niro. This movie is pretty much non- stop action, and by action I mean child abuse. If you hate Robert De Niro this may not be a good movie for you to watch because it will make you hate him even more. This Boy's Life is an incredibly thorough movie; all the main groups of abuse are represented: emotional, physical, psychological and even financial abuses are present throughout. One of the best scenes is when Robert De Niro crams an old mustard jar into Leonardo DiCaprio's eye to teach him a lesson about wasting condiments. This movie has it all, sad drunk driving, awkward gay teens and a bulldog! The sad fact is this movie is actually based on a true story. But, I prefer to forget that and just enjoy the ride.

Tobey Maguire appears in his first credited role.

    Tobias (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his mother Caroline (Ellen Barkin) are at loose ends after Caroline's divorce. Caroline has the get rich scheme of heading for uranium mining out west. After this and other other ideas fail, Caroline and Tobias wind up in Concrete, Washington (yes, it actually exists) where they are getting desperate. In steps Dwight, a local mechanic. Dwight seems sincere in his courting of Caroline and, since he offers stability and security, Caroline is willing to buy what he is offering by marrying him. After the marriage Dwight's dark side surfaces in the major conflict that develops between him and Tobias. Tobias is no angel, but to me his behavior was no more out of line than that of your typical rebellious youth, whereas Dwight's tyrannical behavior struck me as bordering on the sadistic. The scenes of physical abuse I found hard to watch. Why Dwight's reaction to Tobias is so extreme is open to speculation. In part I think it comes from Dwight's perception of what it means to be a man--you are the ultimate authority, one who brooks no opposition. Expanding on that theme, Dwight senses that Tobias is not living up to his stereotypical image, for example Tobias likes to read books of all things. In some ways I got the feeling that Dwight's behavior was not all malicious; some small part of him felt for Tobias and he was trying to impose his vision on him as how to deal with the world. However, there is one pivotal scene that said a lot about Dwight to me. While Dwight and Tobias were watching television a news report came on about Lana Turner's daughter Cheryl Crane murdering Turner's boyfriend Johnny Stompanato, on the grounds that he was brutalizing her mother. Crane was acquitted on the grounds of justifiable homicide. When that last piece of information was mentioned, Dwight looked over at Tobias (who was paying intense attention to the program) with a look that said, "Hmmmm, could this apply to me?" This indicated to me that Dwight knew he had gone over the line in his dealings with Tobias and maybe would pay the ultimate price. The movie takes place in the late 1950s and period details are inserted in order to make that point: cars, hair styles, clothes, TV, movies, music. De Niro is good here--I think you have to be a good actor to play such a thoroughly unlikeable bully as Dwight with such convincing realism. It is no small treat to see De Niro dressed in a scout uniform. Barkin is fine, but Caroline moves to deep background once the major struggle between Dwight and Tobias takes center stage. DiCaprio turns in a particularly good performance, being able to hold his own against two experienced actors. This is billed as a true story, being an accounting of author Tobias Wollf's experiences. I think this should more appropriately be labeled as based on truth, since there are some things that don't ring quite true. For example, the scene that has Tobias running a table saw in shop class at school is wrong. Not even the most inexperienced novice in a wood class would be passing the wood through the saw in the dangerous way that Tobias was. I was cringing just to watch it. And the injury we see he sustains could in no way be caused by the accident as pictured, at the least it would have been more serious. And there was no purpose to what he was doing with the saw to start with. After seeing this I wondered just how well the rest of the movie had been researched. To say that something is a true story is risky--not even most documentaries are without bias. What an author says in an autobiographical text has to be taken with some reservations as to the truth I am left wanting to read the book, since I am sure the relationships are more complicated than what can be presented here in two hours. We don't get to know Caroline very well, and how Dwight's kids from a previous marriage fit into the family is hardly treated. In particular I wanted to know more about Dwight's relationship with the other kids, especially with his son. More details on Tobias' relationship with the effeminate Arthur would be interesting--how did he square that relationship with his other tough friends? Was Arthur as stereotypically gay as shown? Overall I found this to be well acted and absorbing. It reminds me of the father/son battle waged in the 1979 movie, "The Great Santini."

    "You'll never forget me!" shouts an angry Dwight to Tobias and his mother when they're finally leaving the house of so many haunting memories. That's probably the only true thing he ever said, and the proof is, Tobias Wolff, the author wrote a novel about the Dwight years, adapted in 1993 by Michael Caton-Jones. And I remember having seen the film many years ago, before "Titanic", before all Leonardo Di Caprio's adult roles, I didn't forget Dwight, played by De Niro, but I didn't forget Leo either. "This Boy's Life" is the chronicle of Tobias Wolff's teenage days, when his nomadic mother, played by the a sensual Ellen Barkin, decided to go west, the land of greener grasses. She looks for a job, a roof, a school for her boy, but marrying a man would provide everything she needs in once, and a fatherly figure, an extra Tobias severely needs. Finally, in a small town, conveniently named 'Concrete', she meets Dwight, a divorced father with three children, whose gallantry and gentleness don't fool Tobias. His suspicions are immediately confirmed when Dwight confronts him in the car and dares him to ever try to mock him. The character is set, and De Niro here plays one of his most underrated and memorable villainous roles as a bully so blinded by his inferiority complex he doesn't realize he's only venting his anger on Tobias. De Niro maintains a puzzling mix of genuine authority or pathetic craziness that we're never quite sure about his intentions, and even the mother, while feeling the aggressiveness, still believes he can be a model for Tobias. Naturally, as the movie progresses, Dwight's actions get more and more explicit about how cruel and abusive he is, each of his seemingly good actions are followed by a treachery. He encourages Tobias to deliver newspapers yet he steals his money, he buys him a dog, but sells his Winchester to get the money, he registers him to the scout but can't buy him a proper suit, or shoes to play baskets, he teaches him to fight yet only seems to enjoy his towering position to humiliate him. All the film is a succession of conflictual situations between Dwight and Toby, and as soon as De Niro emerges on screen, Barkin dissolves in his shadow. Less than an underusing, it illustrates the fact that she accepts her fate, and choose a neutral position: she doesn't want to be the 'umpire', a wise move that probably avoids an aggravation, since she also endures Dwight complex in bed and makes her only involvement more significant and crucial to the story, which ends in the most cheerful way. Dwight is a dark and unforgettable parenthesis in Tobias' life that marked him forever. We can feel it by the level of emotion displayed by Tobis when he finally escaped from him, yet at this moment, we can't help but feel sorry for De Niro, who as douche-bag as he was, couldn't hide his vulnerability and an obvious insecurity. Only an actor like De Niro could have inspired so many contradictory reactions  and I guess a part of the credit is to the directing, and the storytelling. "This Boy's Life" features many difficult parts, the injustice, the bullying, starting with the most random things like toothpaste, mustard, and it's so futile that you can't doubt that it's true, but it doesn't overdo the pathos, and even translates it into comedy. When De Niro and Leo take the picture in the scout camp, you can't help but smile at the discomposure in Toby's face with De Niro's trademark grin. And the 'comedy' aspect also relies on Toby's capability to resist Dwight's pressure, sometimes he accepts it, he does in the beginning, but as he gets older and grows more rebel, he responds to him, even laugh at him, almost not realizing that he's being influenced by him. On that level, the film features many other subplots, involving a friendship with Arthur Gayle, an ambiguously homosexual who seems infatuated on Toby, and later, he has the feeling that it's Dwight's voice speaking in him, and Toby realizes he might have been molded the worst way, with the only choice being becoming Dwight or like his losers friends. His only chance of escape is to apply for prep schools with the help of Arthur to get the teacher's favors. The conflict between Dwight and Toby is the core of the film, and no matter how powerful is De Niro, Leo is capable to steal the show, to take him face to face, and when a young snotty punk like him can take it from the guy who was already a legend you know there's something promising in this talent. And it's no wonder that Leo was nominated the same year for 'Gilbert Grape'. In my recent reviews, I've been very critical toward Leonardo Di Caprio especially the way he was typecast as a macho tough lead, while there was more to exploit in his angelic face. That's true, I've never bought him as a tough guy, maybe because I didn't want to, maybe because I thought there was a lot of potential wasted, he could have more interesting roles. "The Aviator" was my favorite of his 'recent' roles and I'm still waiting to see "Django Unchained", till that day, all I can do is revisit his performance and "This Boy's Life", and the unforgettable breakdown part, his shout in the mountains finally exorcising the deliverance of getting rid of Dwight, such a communicative moment, or his Eddie Cochran in the car (the scene I remembered the most&agrave;) and put my unfair bias into perspective.

    As time goes by, I'm starting to realize how much of a talent Di Caprio was in his youth. I wonder what went wrong... I also ponder upon a question why movies like "This Boy's Life" don't hit the big screen anymore? When did film making become a shallow business with it's only interest in profits. "This Boy's Life" is anything but a classic Hollywood blockbuster. It's a slice of life presented both in it's best and worst. And life is not like a film either... Being young, smart and trapped in a behindhand environment is tough, often frustrating and inhibiting. It's a first major battle in a war called survival, a battle that would set a young man on it's way and pave the road to his future. Being alone in such a struggle is not easy, and young Toby Wolff would feel it on his skin quite some. Well, maybe not completely alone. Toby's mother tries hard to soldier on in life, and yet, she lacks the energy and will to make that final push. In the absence of a father figure, fourteen year old Tobias endeavors to model himself on his own, fighting not only his inner demons, but also a harsh, inert and primitive surrounding portrayed in the character of Dwigh and the village of Concrete. Will he succeed and break away? It's all in his hands... The entire cast made a remarkable job - Di Caprio for one, followed by Ellen Barkin and Robert De Niro, as well as rest of the team. A tribute would also deservedly go to all of the technical crew, scriptwriter and director. Even without the real-life reference at the end, it's quite obvious this story was written by life itself, which makes it that special and unique. "This Boy's Life" is a good story well portrayed, and as such it rightfully earns it's 10 points. More flicks like this, please! This also presents a small jubilee, since it is my 50th review here on IMDb (including the needlessly removed one). Cheers!

    The story about the relationship between a rebellious 50s teenager and his abusive father, based on the memoirs of writer and literature professor Tobias Wolff. This Boy's Life is incredible, it is absolutely incredibly, it is a powerful an incredibly movie drama that benefits from great directing and powerful performances. I was really surprised at how great this movie was, I was expecting it to be a good movie, but I wasn't expecting it to be a "great" movie, and it is a great movie, it really and truly is. I honestly believe that this is one of the best movies of the last 25 years, it really is that powerful of a movie, it is powerful, touching, moving, and there are a few parts that just might leave you with some tears in your eyes. This Boy's Life is a movie that you will probably have to watch more than once just because of how great it is. If you want to see how great a movie can get, then watch this movie, because it will show you just how great a movie can get. I love this movie, it's honestly one of the best movies that I've seen in a very long time. Let's talk about some of the acting, shall we? Yes lets. In one of his major breakthrough roles, Leonardo DiCaprio gives a marvelous performance as the main character, who suffers a torrent of verbal, emotional, and physical abuse at the hands of his monster of a stepfather, played by the always fabulous Robert De Niro. I also liked the performance of Jonah Blechman, who plays Arthur Gayle, a person who DiCaprio's character doesn't get along with at first, but eventually becomes good friends with. Robert De Niro's performance as the horrid stepfather is a great one, but while he was great, Leonardo DiCaprio gets the most praise from me, for being a young adult at the time he made this movie, he was certainly phenomenal in the role he played. To make an extremely long story short, everyone who starred in this movie did a great job, especially Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. In short, This Boy's Life is one of the best movies that I've seen in a very, very, very long time, it's spectacular, marvelous, fabulous, and unforgettable. I expected De Niro to be good in this movie, as I absolutely adore the man, but I didn't like the movie just because he was in it, I liked it for a lot of other reason as well, such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Blechman. If you haven't seen this movie, then you've got to see it, because there is an extremely high chance that you will love it. You will laugh, you will cry, you will cheer, you will be thrilled with what you will watch. This Boy's Life is a movie that will last, it will never grow old, it will remain a great movie until the end of time, it is not only one of the best I've seen, but it is also one of the best of both Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. So if you haven't seen this movie yet, then watch it, because the chances are you will really, really, really enjoy it. 10/10

    I read the book so many times. Even knew there was a movie about it I had read and re read the book. I loved Tobias Wolff's writing. I think a major reason I didn't like it was because the book had so much to offer. It felt as though there wasn't enough depth in the movie. The movie was good no doubt. I am not a fan of Leonardo Di caprio. However, he did do a good job in this movie. I could think of no one better who could play the role of father as well as Robert De Niro did... Overall it was good and I wouldn't mind watching it again. Though I would prefer reading it again a lot more. Which is a lot for me to say because I do prefer movies a lot more than books. (sorry)

    A single mother and her difficult son find family life isn't necessarily all it's cracked up to be in this film.This Boy's Life is a film adaptation of the memoir of the same name by Tobias Wolff. It is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and it features Leonardo DiCaprio as Tobias Wolff together with Robert De Niro and Ellen Barkin. The film also co-stars Chris Cooper,Carla Gugino,Eliza Dushku and Tobey Maguire in a small role. Nomadic, flaky Caroline just wants to settle down in one place, find a decent guy, and provide a better home for her handful of a son, Toby. When she moves to Seattle and meets the respectful, respectable Dwight Hansen, she thinks she's got it made. Toby, however, feels differently after spending a few months with Dwight and his children and away from Caroline. The boy's stepfather-to-be seems to want to mold Toby into a better person, but to do so he emotionally, verbally, and physically abuses the kid. The marriage proceeds, and soon Caroline, too, recognizes Dwight's need to dominate everyone around him. She sticks with it, though, convinced it's the best thing for her son, and several years of dysfunction ensue. During this time, Tobias befriends another misfit, the possibly homosexual young Arthur Gayle, while continuing to chafe under the yoke of his repressive stepfather.Hoping to leave Concrete and live with his older brother Gregory, Toby decides to apply for east-coast prep-school scholarships. Realizing his grades are not adequate to apply, Toby devises a plan to submit falsified grade reports. Meanwhile, the friendship between Arthur and Toby becomes strained when Arthur confronts Toby regarding his behavior; Arthur tells Toby he is acting more and more like Dwight and asks Toby, "why should you be the one who gets to leave?" Even so, Arthur helps his friend get the papers Toby needs to falsify his grade records and Toby sends in his prep-school applications. When Toby tells Arthur he can leave Concrete and have a better life too, Arthur tells him he will most likely stay. After numerous rejections, Toby is accepted to the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania with a full scholarship.At the end of the film following two years of marriage, Caroline defends Toby during a physically violent argument between her son and husband and they are both seen leaving Dwight and Concrete. This movie provided the first lead role for future superstar Leonardo DiCaprio. He steals the show in this tale of learning how to be a man, with a sly Robert De Niro also giving a good performance.It was a a compelling character study that is well worth watching despite of being too long and a plot that drags.It shows how a resilient teenager survives childhood trauma and adversity through independence, anger and creativity.In short,it is a powerful and compelling stuff that makes it a must-see.

    This Boys Life A Review by Ashley "I SEE YOUR SPOTS LEOPARD!" If I were to explain to you what this movie is actually about it would really put you off. It could make you not even want to see the movie. That being said, this movie is a total gem! It was a boring, hot, sunny afternoon and there was absolutely nothing to watch on television. I was literally flipping through channels when somewhere along the line I decided that a slow paced, uncomfortable, movie about child abuse on Showcase would do. I soon realized that the child being abused was Leonardo DiCaprio and the person doing the abusing was none other than Robert De Niro. This movie is pretty much non- stop action, and by action I mean child abuse. If you hate Robert De Niro this may not be a good movie for you to watch because it will make you hate him even more. This Boy's Life is an incredibly thorough movie; all the main groups of abuse are represented: emotional, physical, psychological and even financial abuses are present throughout. One of the best scenes is when Robert De Niro crams an old mustard jar into Leonardo DiCaprio's eye to teach him a lesson about wasting condiments. This movie has it all, sad drunk driving, awkward gay teens and a bulldog! The sad fact is this movie is actually based on a true story. But, I prefer to forget that and just enjoy the ride.

    There are times when you get sad and the task at hand seems so hard. What you don't realize is that there are people who have faced times harder, and done equally challenging things. This story is one such narrative of a boy from a small town with a mother trying to get settled somewhere. As the attempts of settling at a new city goes on, she meets a guy(de niro). It is via this guy that she realizes that she could settle down for herself and her son (do caprio). As an when their lives get intertwined, di caprio faces angst from deniro and tries to get a future for himself out of the small town. This is his struggle to learn, to get a direction and to survive! Follow Tobias Wolff's memoir into his journey beyond the brutality and the hopelessness. For all the depth, I give this movie an 8 on 10

    Wow. This was a harsh film, but a damn good one at that. What is more amazing about this movie is that it is based on the memoirs of the real Tobias Wolf! It's a true story, and that made it all the more better while viewing this one. I cannot state how unpleasant this movie can be at times. The stuff Jack (Tobias) has to endure is really heart wrenching, and there were a few moments where I actually gasped out loud. It's not very often a movie can grip me with complete astonishment, but this managed to do just that. I give a lot of credit to the ensemble performances. Leo DiCaprio is astonishing for a kid at his age at this juncture. He is solely responsible for taking me on a journey I won't soon forget. He is sympathetic, very vulnerable, and I was able to empathize with him all the way. You will feel desperation when it comes to some of his scenes. Robert DeNiro plays one of the most brazen, and detestable characters I have ever seen. He is often terrifying as Dwight. DeNiro is credited for many amazing roles and rightfully so, but this one is shockingly neglected a lot of the time when it comes to his resume. What a chilling performance! Ellen Barkin is exceptionally good as the clueless, yet likable Mother. She may make you wanna slap her one at times, but you'll lover her for the most part, i'm sure. Eliza Dushku, Tobey Maguire, among others have small roles here. Final Thoughts: It's a hard film to review without revealing so much. It's a fantastic, if draining experience. If you're in the mood for an excellent heavy drama, I would choose this one without question. It'll stay with you after it is over 9/10

    Moving adaptation of Tobias Wolff's memoir. Leonardo DiCaprio, in the same year he became a break-out star for What's Eating Gilbert Grape, stars as Wolff, a teenager who moves all around the country with his mother (Ellen Barkin). They finally settle down in Concrete, Washington when Barkin falls for a mechanic (Robert De Niro). After the two marry, De Niro quickly reveals his true colors: he's a petulant, petty jerk. In particular, he treats DiCaprio like total crap. He has three kids of his own (including a young Carla Gugino and Eliza Dushku), and he treats them well enough, but he feels jealous of DiCaprio. He's severely emotionally abusive toward him and even physically so when pushed. DiCaprio, who isn't exactly a good kid, gets his life straighter, seemingly just to spite his stepfather. DiCaprio was quite good in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but, for my money, his talent shines through here much more in a less showy role. I think most people have known a guy just like De Niro's character, and he's very good here. Barkin is also quite good. Jonah Blechman is also very good as DiCaprio's gay buddy. Tobey Maguire appears in his first credited role.

    Tobias (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his mother Caroline (Ellen Barkin) are at loose ends after Caroline's divorce. Caroline has the get rich scheme of heading for uranium mining out west. After this and other other ideas fail, Caroline and Tobias wind up in Concrete, Washington (yes, it actually exists) where they are getting desperate. In steps Dwight, a local mechanic.

This indicated to me that Dwight knew he had gone over the line in his dealings with Tobias and maybe would pay the ultimate price. The movie takes place in the late 1950s and period details are inserted in order to make that point: cars, hair styles, clothes, TV, movies, music. De Niro is good here--I think you have to be a good actor to play such a thoroughly unlikeable bully as Dwight with such convincing realism. It is no small treat to see De Niro dressed in a scout uniform. Barkin is fine, but Caroline moves to deep background once the major struggle between Dwight and Tobias takes center stage. DiCaprio turns in a particularly good performance, being able to hold his own against two experienced actors. This is billed as a true story, being an accounting of author Tobias Wollf's experiences. I think this should more appropriately be labeled as based on truth, since there are some things that don't ring quite true. For example, the scene that has Tobias running a table saw in shop class at school is wrong. Not even the most inexperienced novice in a wood class would be passing the wood through the saw in the dangerous way that Tobias was. I was cringing just to watch it. And the injury we see he sustains could in no way be caused by the accident as pictured, at the least it would have been more serious. And there was no purpose to what he was doing with the saw to start with. After seeing this I wondered just how well the rest of the movie had been researched. To say that something is a true story is risky--not even most documentaries are without bias.

All the film is a succession of conflictual situations between Dwight and Toby, and as soon as De Niro emerges on screen, Barkin dissolves in his shadow. Less than an underusing, it illustrates the fact that she accepts her fate, and choose a neutral position: she doesn't want to be the 'umpire', a wise move that probably avoids an aggravation, since she also endures Dwight complex in bed and makes her only involvement more significant and crucial to the story, which ends in the most cheerful way. Dwight is a dark and unforgettable parenthesis in Tobias' life that marked him forever. We can feel it by the level of emotion displayed by Tobis when he finally escaped from him, yet at this moment, we can't help but feel sorry for De Niro, who as douche-bag as he was, couldn't hide his vulnerability and an obvious insecurity. Only an actor like De Niro could have inspired so many contradictory reactions  and I guess a part of the credit is to the directing, and the storytelling. "This Boy's Life" features many difficult parts, the injustice, the bullying, starting with the most random things like toothpaste, mustard, and it's so futile that you can't doubt that it's true, but it doesn't overdo the pathos, and even translates it into comedy. When De Niro and Leo take the picture in the scout camp, you can't help but smile at the discomposure in Toby's face with De Niro's trademark grin. And the 'comedy' aspect also relies on Toby's capability to resist Dwight's pressure, sometimes he accepts it, he does in the beginning, but as he gets older and grows more rebel, he responds to him, even laugh at him, almost not realizing that he's being influenced by him. On that level, the film features many other subplots, involving a friendship with Arthur Gayle, an ambiguously homosexual who seems infatuated on Toby, and later, he has the feeling that it's Dwight's voice speaking in him, and Toby realizes he might have been molded the worst way, with the only choice being becoming Dwight or like his losers friends. His only chance of escape is to apply for prep schools with the help of Arthur to get the teacher's favors. The conflict between Dwight and Toby is the core of the film, and no matter how powerful is De Niro, Leo is capable to steal the show, to take him face to face, and when a young snotty punk like him can take it from the guy who was already a legend you know there's something promising in this talent. And it's no wonder that Leo was nominated the same year for 'Gilbert Grape'. In my recent reviews, I've been very critical toward Leonardo Di Caprio especially the way he was typecast as a macho tough lead, while there was more to exploit in his angelic face. That's true, I've never bought him as a tough guy, maybe because I didn't want to, maybe because I thought there was a lot of potential wasted, he could have more interesting roles. "The Aviator" was my favorite of his 'recent' roles and I'm still waiting to see "Django Unchained", till that day, all I can do is revisit his performance and "This Boy's Life", and the unforgettable breakdown part, his shout in the mountains finally exorcising the deliverance of getting rid of Dwight, such a communicative moment, or his Eddie Cochran in the car (the scene I remembered the most&agrave;) and put my unfair bias into perspective.

    As time goes by, I'm starting to realize how much of a talent Di Caprio was in his youth. I wonder what went wrong... I also ponder upon a question why movies like "This Boy's Life" don't hit the big screen anymore? When did film making become a shallow business with it's only interest in profits. "This Boy's Life" is anything but a classic Hollywood blockbuster. It's a slice of life presented both in it's best and worst. And life is not like a film either... Being young, smart and trapped in a behindhand environment is tough, often frustrating and inhibiting. It's a first major battle in a war called survival, a battle that would set a young man on it's way and pave the road to his future. Being alone in such a struggle is not easy, and young Toby Wolff would feel it on his skin quite some. Well, maybe not completely alone. Toby's mother tries hard to soldier on in life, and yet, she lacks the energy and will to make that final push. In the absence of a father figure, fourteen year old Tobias endeavors to model himself on his own, fighting not only his inner demons, but also a harsh, inert and primitive surrounding portrayed in the character of Dwigh and the village of Concrete. Will he succeed and break away? It's all in his hands... The entire cast made a remarkable job - Di Caprio for one, followed by Ellen Barkin and Robert De Niro, as well as rest of the team. A tribute would also deservedly go to all of the technical crew, scriptwriter and director. Even without the real-life reference at the end, it's quite obvious this story was written by life itself, which makes it that special and unique. "This Boy's Life" is a good story well portrayed, and as such it rightfully earns it's 10 points. More flicks like this, please! This also presents a small jubilee, since it is my 50th review here on IMDb (including the needlessly removed one). Cheers!

    The story about the relationship between a rebellious 50s teenager and his abusive father, based on the memoirs of writer and literature professor Tobias Wolff. This Boy's Life is incredible, it is absolutely incredibly, it is a powerful an incredibly movie drama that benefits from great directing and powerful performances. I was really surprised at how great this movie was, I was expecting it to be a good movie, but I wasn't expecting it to be a "great" movie, and it is a great movie, it really and truly is. I honestly believe that this is one of the best movies of the last 25 years, it really is that powerful of a movie, it is powerful, touching, moving, and there are a few parts that just might leave you with some tears in your eyes. This Boy's Life is a movie that you will probably have to watch more than once just because of how great it is. If you want to see how great a movie can get, then watch this movie, because it will show you just how great a movie can get. I love this movie, it's honestly one of the best movies that I've seen in a very long time. Let's talk about some of the acting, shall we? Yes lets. In one of his major breakthrough roles, Leonardo DiCaprio gives a marvelous performance as the main character, who suffers a torrent of verbal, emotional, and physical abuse at the hands of his monster of a stepfather, played by the always fabulous Robert De Niro. I also liked the performance of Jonah Blechman, who plays Arthur Gayle, a person who DiCaprio's character doesn't get along with at first, but eventually becomes good friends with. Robert De Niro's performance as the horrid stepfather is a great one, but while he was great, Leonardo DiCaprio gets the most praise from me, for being a young adult at the time he made this movie, he was certainly phenomenal in the role he played. To make an extremely long story short, everyone who starred in this movie did a great job, especially Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. In short, This Boy's Life is one of the best movies that I've seen in a very, very, very long time, it's spectacular, marvelous, fabulous, and unforgettable. I expected De Niro to be good in this movie, as I absolutely adore the man, but I didn't like the movie just because he was in it, I liked it for a lot of other reason as well, such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Blechman. If you haven't seen this movie, then you've got to see it, because there is an extremely high chance that you will love it. You will laugh, you will cry, you will cheer, you will be thrilled with what you will watch. This Boy's Life is a movie that will last, it will never grow old, it will remain a great movie until the end of time, it is not only one of the best I've seen, but it is also one of the best of both Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. So if you haven't seen this movie yet, then watch it, because the chances are you will really, really, really enjoy it. 10/10

    I read the book so many times. Even knew there was a movie about it I had read and re read the book. I loved Tobias Wolff's writing. I think a major reason I didn't like it was because the book had so much to offer. It felt as though there wasn't enough depth in the movie. The movie was good no doubt. I am not a fan of Leonardo Di caprio. However, he did do a good job in this movie. I could think of no one better who could play the role of father as well as Robert De Niro did... Overall it was good and I wouldn't mind watching it again. Though I would prefer reading it again a lot more. Which is a lot for me to say because I do prefer movies a lot more than books. (sorry)

    A single mother and her difficult son find family life isn't necessarily all it's cracked up to be in this film.This Boy's Life is a film adaptation of the memoir of the same name by Tobias Wolff. It is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and it features Leonardo DiCaprio as Tobias Wolff together with Robert De Niro and Ellen Barkin. The film also co-stars Chris Cooper,Carla Gugino,Eliza Dushku and Tobey Maguire in a small role. Nomadic, flaky Caroline just wants to settle down in one place, find a decent guy, and provide a better home for her handful of a son, Toby. When she moves to Seattle and meets the respectful, respectable Dwight Hansen, she thinks she's got it made. Toby, however, feels differently after spending a few months with Dwight and his children and away from Caroline. The boy's stepfather-to-be seems to want to mold Toby into a better person, but to do so he emotionally, verbally, and physically abuses the kid. The marriage proceeds, and soon Caroline, too, recognizes Dwight's need to dominate everyone around him. She sticks with it, though, convinced it's the best thing for her son, and several years of dysfunction ensue. During this time, Tobias befriends another misfit, the possibly homosexual young Arthur Gayle, while continuing to chafe under the yoke of his repressive stepfather.Hoping to leave Concrete and live with his older brother Gregory, Toby decides to apply for east-coast prep-school scholarships. Realizing his grades are not adequate to apply, Toby devises a plan to submit falsified grade reports. Meanwhile, the friendship between Arthur and Toby becomes strained when Arthur confronts Toby regarding his behavior; Arthur tells Toby he is acting more and more like Dwight and asks Toby, "why should you be the one who gets to leave?" Even so, Arthur helps his friend get the papers Toby needs to falsify his grade records and Toby sends in his prep-school applications. When Toby tells Arthur he can leave Concrete and have a better life too, Arthur tells him he will most likely stay. After numerous rejections, Toby is accepted to the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania with a full scholarship.At the end of the film following two years of marriage, Caroline defends Toby during a physically violent argument between her son and husband and they are both seen leaving Dwight and Concrete. This movie provided the first lead role for future superstar Leonardo DiCaprio. He steals the show in this tale of learning how to be a man, with a sly Robert De Niro also giving a good performance.It was a a compelling character study that is well worth watching despite of being too long and a plot that drags.It shows how a resilient teenager survives childhood trauma and adversity through independence, anger and creativity.In short,it is a powerful and compelling stuff that makes it a must-see.

    This Boys Life A Review by Ashley "I SEE YOUR SPOTS LEOPARD!" If I were to explain to you what this movie is actually about it would really put you off. It could make you not even want to see the movie. That being said, this movie is a total gem! It was a boring, hot, sunny afternoon and there was absolutely nothing to watch on television. I was literally flipping through channels when somewhere along the line I decided that a slow paced, uncomfortable, movie about child abuse on Showcase would do. I soon realized that the child being abused was Leonardo DiCaprio and the person doing the abusing was none other than Robert De Niro. This movie is pretty much non- stop action, and by action I mean child abuse. If you hate Robert De Niro this may not be a good movie for you to watch because it will make you hate him even more. This Boy's Life is an incredibly thorough movie; all the main groups of abuse are represented: emotional, physical, psychological and even financial abuses are present throughout. One of the best scenes is when Robert De Niro crams an old mustard jar into Leonardo DiCaprio's eye to teach him a lesson about wasting condiments. This movie has it all, sad drunk driving, awkward gay teens and a bulldog! The sad fact is this movie is actually based on a true story. But, I prefer to forget that and just enjoy the ride.

    There are times when you get sad and the task at hand seems so hard. What you don't realize is that there are people who have faced times harder, and done equally challenging things. This story is one such narrative of a boy from a small town with a mother trying to get settled somewhere. As the attempts of settling at a new city goes on, she meets a guy(de niro). It is via this guy that she realizes that she could settle down for herself and her son (do caprio). As an when their lives get intertwined, di caprio faces angst from deniro and tries to get a future for himself out of the small town. This is his struggle to learn, to get a direction and to survive! Follow Tobias Wolff's memoir into his journey beyond the brutality and the hopelessness. For all the depth, I give this movie an 8 on 10

    Wow. This was a harsh film, but a damn good one at that. What is more amazing about this movie is that it is based on the memoirs of the real Tobias Wolf! It's a true story, and that made it all the more better while viewing this one. I cannot state how unpleasant this movie can be at times. The stuff Jack (Tobias) has to endure is really heart wrenching, and there were a few moments where I actually gasped out loud. It's not very often a movie can grip me with complete astonishment, but this managed to do just that. I give a lot of credit to the ensemble performances. Leo DiCaprio is astonishing for a kid at his age at this juncture. He is solely responsible for taking me on a journey I won't soon forget. He is sympathetic, very vulnerable, and I was able to empathize with him all the way. You will feel desperation when it comes to some of his scenes. Robert DeNiro plays one of the most brazen, and detestable characters I have ever seen. He is often terrifying as Dwight. DeNiro is credited for many amazing roles and rightfully so, but this one is shockingly neglected a lot of the time when it comes to his resume. What a chilling performance! Ellen Barkin is exceptionally good as the clueless, yet likable Mother. She may make you wanna slap her one at times, but you'll lover her for the most part, i'm sure. Eliza Dushku, Tobey Maguire, among others have small roles here. Final Thoughts: It's a hard film to review without revealing so much. It's a fantastic, if draining experience. If you're in the mood for an excellent heavy drama, I would choose this one without question. It'll stay with you after it is over 9/10

    Moving adaptation of Tobias Wolff's memoir. Leonardo DiCaprio, in the same year he became a break-out star for What's Eating Gilbert Grape, stars as Wolff, a teenager who moves all around the country with his mother (Ellen Barkin). They finally settle down in Concrete, Washington when Barkin falls for a mechanic (Robert De Niro). After the two marry, De Niro quickly reveals his true colors: he's a petulant, petty jerk. In particular, he treats DiCaprio like total crap. He has three kids of his own (including a young Carla Gugino and Eliza Dushku), and he treats them well enough, but he feels jealous of DiCaprio. He's severely emotionally abusive toward him and even physically so when pushed. DiCaprio, who isn't exactly a good kid, gets his life straighter, seemingly just to spite his stepfather. DiCaprio was quite good in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but, for my money, his talent shines through here much more in a less showy role. I think most people have known a guy just like De Niro's character, and he's very good here. Barkin is also quite good. Jonah Blechman is also very good as DiCaprio's gay buddy. Tobey Maguire appears in his first credited role.

    Tobias (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his mother Caroline (Ellen Barkin) are at loose ends after Caroline's divorce. Caroline has the get rich scheme of heading for uranium mining out west. After this and other other ideas fail, Caroline and Tobias wind up in Concrete, Washington (yes, it actually exists) where they are getting desperate. In steps Dwight, a local mechanic. Dwight seems sincere in his courting of Caroline and, since he offers stability and security, Caroline is willing to buy what he is offering by marrying him. After the marriage Dwight's dark side surfaces in the major conflict that develops between him and Tobias. Tobias is no angel, but to me his behavior was no more out of line than that of your typical rebellious youth, whereas Dwight's tyrannical behavior struck me as bordering on the sadistic. The scenes of physical abuse I found hard to watch. Why Dwight's reaction to Tobias is so extreme is open to speculation. In part I think it comes from Dwight's perception of what it means to be a man--you are the ultimate authority, one who brooks no opposition. Expanding on that theme, Dwight senses that Tobias is not living up to his stereotypical image, for example Tobias likes to read books of all things. In some ways I got the feeling that Dwight's behavior was not all malicious; some small part of him felt for Tobias and he was trying to impose his vision on him as how to deal with the world. However, there is one pivotal scene that said a lot about Dwight to me. While Dwight and Tobias were watching television a news report came on about Lana Turner's daughter Cheryl Crane murdering Turner's boyfriend Johnny Stompanato, on the grounds that he was brutalizing her mother. Crane was acquitted on the grounds of justifiable homicide. When that last piece of information was mentioned, Dwight looked over at Tobias (who was paying intense attention to the program) with a look that said, "Hmmmm, could this apply to me?" This indicated to me that Dwight knew he had gone over the line in his dealings with Tobias and maybe would pay the ultimate price. The movie takes place in the late 1950s and period details are inserted in order to make that point: cars, hair styles, clothes, TV, movies, music. De Niro is good here--I think you have to be a good actor to play such a thoroughly unlikeable bully as Dwight with such convincing realism. It is no small treat to see De Niro dressed in a scout uniform. Barkin is fine, but Caroline moves to deep background once the major struggle between Dwight and Tobias takes center stage. DiCaprio turns in a particularly good performance, being able to hold his own against two experienced actors. This is billed as a true story, being an accounting of author Tobias Wollf's experiences. I think this should more appropriately be labeled as based on truth, since there are some things that don't ring quite true. For example, the scene that has Tobias running a table saw in shop class at school is wrong. Not even the most inexperienced novice in a wood class would be passing the wood through the saw in the dangerous way that Tobias was. I was cringing just to watch it. And the injury we see he sustains could in no way be caused by the accident as pictured, at the least it would have been more serious. And there was no purpose to what he was doing with the saw to start with. After seeing this I wondered just how well the rest of the movie had been researched. To say that something is a true story is risky--not even most documentaries are without bias. What an author says in an autobiographical text has to be taken with some reservations as to the truth I am left wanting to read the book, since I am sure the relationships are more complicated than what can be presented here in two hours. We don't get to know Caroline very well, and how Dwight's kids from a previous marriage fit into the family is hardly treated. In particular I wanted to know more about Dwight's relationship with the other kids, especially with his son. More details on Tobias' relationship with the effeminate Arthur would be interesting--how did he square that relationship with his other tough friends? Was Arthur as stereotypically gay as shown? Overall I found this to be well acted and absorbing. It reminds me of the father/son battle waged in the 1979 movie, "The Great Santini."

    "You'll never forget me!" shouts an angry Dwight to Tobias and his mother when they're finally leaving the house of so many haunting memories. That's probably the only true thing he ever said, and the proof is, Tobias Wolff, the author wrote a novel about the Dwight years, adapted in 1993 by Michael Caton-Jones. And I remember having seen the film many years ago, before "Titanic", before all Leonardo Di Caprio's adult roles, I didn't forget Dwight, played by De Niro, but I didn't forget Leo either. "This Boy's Life" is the chronicle of Tobias Wolff's teenage days, when his nomadic mother, played by the a sensual Ellen Barkin, decided to go west, the land of greener grasses. She looks for a job, a roof, a school for her boy, but marrying a man would provide everything she needs in once, and a fatherly figure, an extra Tobias severely needs. Finally, in a small town, conveniently named 'Concrete', she meets Dwight, a divorced father with three children, whose gallantry and gentleness don't fool Tobias. His suspicions are immediately confirmed when Dwight confronts him in the car and dares him to ever try to mock him. The character is set, and De Niro here plays one of his most underrated and memorable villainous roles as a bully so blinded by his inferiority complex he doesn't realize he's only venting his anger on Tobias. De Niro maintains a puzzling mix of genuine authority or pathetic craziness that we're never quite sure about his intentions, and even the mother, while feeling the aggressiveness, still believes he can be a model for Tobias. Naturally, as the movie progresses, Dwight's actions get more and more explicit about how cruel and abusive he is, each of his seemingly good actions are followed by a treachery. He encourages Tobias to deliver newspapers yet he steals his money, he buys him a dog, but sells his Winchester to get the money, he registers him to the scout but can't buy him a proper suit, or shoes to play baskets, he teaches him to fight yet only seems to enjoy his towering position to humiliate him. All the film is a succession of conflictual situations between Dwight and Toby, and as soon as De Niro emerges on screen, Barkin dissolves in his shadow. Less than an underusing, it illustrates the fact that she accepts her fate, and choose a neutral position: she doesn't want to be the 'umpire', a wise move that probably avoids an aggravation, since she also endures Dwight complex in bed and makes her only involvement more significant and crucial to the story, which ends in the most cheerful way. Dwight is a dark and unforgettable parenthesis in Tobias' life that marked him forever. We can feel it by the level of emotion displayed by Tobis when he finally escaped from him, yet at this moment, we can't help but feel sorry for De Niro, who as douche-bag as he was, couldn't hide his vulnerability and an obvious insecurity. Only an actor like De Niro could have inspired so many contradictory reactions  and I guess a part of the credit is to the directing, and the storytelling. "This Boy's Life" features many difficult parts, the injustice, the bullying, starting with the most random things like toothpaste, mustard, and it's so futile that you can't doubt that it's true, but it doesn't overdo the pathos, and even translates it into comedy. When De Niro and Leo take the picture in the scout camp, you can't help but smile at the discomposure in Toby's face with De Niro's trademark grin. And the 'comedy' aspect also relies on Toby's capability to resist Dwight's pressure, sometimes he accepts it, he does in the beginning, but as he gets older and grows more rebel, he responds to him, even laugh at him, almost not realizing that he's being influenced by him. On that level, the film features many other subplots, involving a friendship with Arthur Gayle, an ambiguously homosexual who seems infatuated on Toby, and later, he has the feeling that it's Dwight's voice speaking in him, and Toby realizes he might have been molded the worst way, with the only choice being becoming Dwight or like his losers friends. His only chance of escape is to apply for prep schools with the help of Arthur to get the teacher's favors. The conflict between Dwight and Toby is the core of the film, and no matter how powerful is De Niro, Leo is capable to steal the show, to take him face to face, and when a young snotty punk like him can take it from the guy who was already a legend you know there's something promising in this talent. And it's no wonder that Leo was nominated the same year for 'Gilbert Grape'. In my recent reviews, I've been very critical toward Leonardo Di Caprio especially the way he was typecast as a macho tough lead, while there was more to exploit in his angelic face. That's true, I've never bought him as a tough guy, maybe because I didn't want to, maybe because I thought there was a lot of potential wasted, he could have more interesting roles. "The Aviator" was my favorite of his 'recent' roles and I'm still waiting to see "Django Unchained", till that day, all I can do is revisit his performance and "This Boy's Life", and the unforgettable breakdown part, his shout in the mountains finally exorcising the deliverance of getting rid of Dwight, such a communicative moment, or his Eddie Cochran in the car (the scene I remembered the most&agrave;) and put my unfair bias into perspective.

If you want to see how great a movie can get, then watch this movie, because it will show you just how great a movie can get. I love this movie, it's honestly one of the best movies that I've seen in a very long time. Let's talk about some of the acting, shall we? Yes lets. In one of his major breakthrough roles, Leonardo DiCaprio gives a marvelous performance as the main character, who suffers a torrent of verbal, emotional, and physical abuse at the hands of his monster of a stepfather, played by the always fabulous Robert De Niro. I also liked the performance of Jonah Blechman, who plays Arthur Gayle, a person who DiCaprio's character doesn't get along with at first, but eventually becomes good friends with. Robert De Niro's performance as the horrid stepfather is a great one, but while he was great, Leonardo DiCaprio gets the most praise from me, for being a young adult at the time he made this movie, he was certainly phenomenal in the role he played. To make an extremely long story short, everyone who starred in this movie did a great job, especially Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. In short, This Boy's Life is one of the best movies that I've seen in a very, very, very long time, it's spectacular, marvelous, fabulous, and unforgettable. I expected De Niro to be good in this movie, as I absolutely adore the man, but I didn't like the movie just because he was in it, I liked it for a lot of other reason as well, such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Blechman. If you haven't seen this movie, then you've got to see it, because there is an extremely high chance that you will love it. You will laugh, you will cry, you will cheer, you will be thrilled with what you will watch. This Boy's Life is a movie that will last, it will never grow old, it will remain a great movie until the end of time, it is not only one of the best I've seen, but it is also one of the best of both Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. So if you haven't seen this movie yet, then watch it, because the chances are you will really, really, really enjoy it. 10/10

    I read the book so many times. Even knew there was a movie about it I had read and re read the book. I loved Tobias Wolff's writing. I think a major reason I didn't like it was because the book had so much to offer. It felt as though there wasn't enough depth in the movie. The movie was good no doubt. I am not a fan of Leonardo Di caprio. However, he did do a good job in this movie. I could think of no one better who could play the role of father as well as Robert De Niro did... Overall it was good and I wouldn't mind watching it again. Though I would prefer reading it again a lot more. Which is a lot for me to say because I do prefer movies a lot more than books. (sorry)

    A single mother and her difficult son find family life isn't necessarily all it's cracked up to be in this film.This Boy's Life is a film adaptation of the memoir of the same name by Tobias Wolff. It is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and it features Leonardo DiCaprio as Tobias Wolff together with Robert De Niro and Ellen Barkin. The film also co-stars Chris Cooper,Carla Gugino,Eliza Dushku and Tobey Maguire in a small role. Nomadic, flaky Caroline just wants to settle down in one place, find a decent guy, and provide a better home for her handful of a son, Toby. When she moves to Seattle and meets the respectful, respectable Dwight Hansen, she thinks she's got it made. Toby, however, feels differently after spending a few months with Dwight and his children and away from Caroline. The boy's stepfather-to-be seems to want to mold Toby into a better person, but to do so he emotionally, verbally, and physically abuses the kid. The marriage proceeds, and soon Caroline, too, recognizes Dwight's need to dominate everyone around him. She sticks with it, though, convinced it's the best thing for her son, and several years of dysfunction ensue. During this time, Tobias befriends another misfit, the possibly homosexual young Arthur Gayle, while continuing to chafe under the yoke of his repressive stepfather.Hoping to leave Concrete and live with his older brother Gregory, Toby decides to apply for east-coast prep-school scholarships. Realizing his grades are not adequate to apply, Toby devises a plan to submit falsified grade reports. Meanwhile, the friendship between Arthur and Toby becomes strained when Arthur confronts Toby regarding his behavior; Arthur tells Toby he is acting more and more like Dwight and asks Toby, "why should you be the one who gets to leave?" Even so, Arthur helps his friend get the papers Toby needs to falsify his grade records and Toby sends in his prep-school applications. When Toby tells Arthur he can leave Concrete and have a better life too, Arthur tells him he will most likely stay. After numerous rejections, Toby is accepted to the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania with a full scholarship.At the end of the film following two years of marriage, Caroline defends Toby during a physically violent argument between her son and husband and they are both seen leaving Dwight and Concrete. This movie provided the first lead role for future superstar Leonardo DiCaprio. He steals the show in this tale of learning how to be a man, with a sly Robert De Niro also giving a good performance.It was a a compelling character study that is well worth watching despite of being too long and a plot that drags.It shows how a resilient teenager survives childhood trauma and adversity through independence, anger and creativity.In short,it is a powerful and compelling stuff that makes it a must-see.

    This Boys Life A Review by Ashley "I SEE YOUR SPOTS LEOPARD!" If I were to explain to you what this movie is actually about it would really put you off. It could make you not even want to see the movie. That being said, this movie is a total gem! It was a boring, hot, sunny afternoon and there was absolutely nothing to watch on television. I was literally flipping through channels when somewhere along the line I decided that a slow paced, uncomfortable, movie about child abuse on Showcase would do. I soon realized that the child being abused was Leonardo DiCaprio and the person doing the abusing was none other than Robert De Niro. This movie is pretty much non- stop action, and by action I mean child abuse. If you hate Robert De Niro this may not be a good movie for you to watch because it will make you hate him even more. This Boy's Life is an incredibly thorough movie; all the main groups of abuse are represented: emotional, physical, psychological and even financial abuses are present throughout. One of the best scenes is when Robert De Niro crams an old mustard jar into Leonardo DiCaprio's eye to teach him a lesson about wasting condiments. This movie has it all, sad drunk driving, awkward gay teens and a bulldog! The sad fact is this movie is actually based on a true story. But, I prefer to forget that and just enjoy the ride.

    There are times when you get sad and the task at hand seems so hard. What you don't realize is that there are people who have faced times harder, and done equally challenging things. This story is one such narrative of a boy from a small town with a mother trying to get settled somewhere. As the attempts of settling at a new city goes on, she meets a guy(de niro). It is via this guy that she realizes that she could settle down for herself and her son (do caprio). As an when their lives get intertwined, di caprio faces angst from deniro and tries to get a future for himself out of the small town. This is his struggle to learn, to get a direction and to survive! Follow Tobias Wolff's memoir into his journey beyond the brutality and the hopelessness. For all the depth, I give this movie an 8 on 10

    Wow. This was a harsh film, but a damn good one at that. What is more amazing about this movie is that it is based on the memoirs of the real Tobias Wolf! It's a true story, and that made it all the more better while viewing this one. I cannot state how unpleasant this movie can be at times. The stuff Jack (Tobias) has to endure is really heart wrenching, and there were a few moments where I actually gasped out loud. It's not very often a movie can grip me with complete astonishment, but this managed to do just that. I give a lot of credit to the ensemble performances. Leo DiCaprio is astonishing for a kid at his age at this juncture. He is solely responsible for taking me on a journey I won't soon forget. He is sympathetic, very vulnerable, and I was able to empathize with him all the way. You will feel desperation when it comes to some of his scenes. Robert DeNiro plays one of the most brazen, and detestable characters I have ever seen. He is often terrifying as Dwight. DeNiro is credited for many amazing roles and rightfully so, but this one is shockingly neglected a lot of the time when it comes to his resume. What a chilling performance! Ellen Barkin is exceptionally good as the clueless, yet likable Mother. She may make you wanna slap her one at times, but you'll lover her for the most part, i'm sure. Eliza Dushku, Tobey Maguire, among others have small roles here. Final Thoughts: It's a hard film to review without revealing so much. It's a fantastic, if draining experience. If you're in the mood for an excellent heavy drama, I would choose this one without question. It'll stay with you after it is over 9/10

    Moving adaptation of Tobias Wolff's memoir. Leonardo DiCaprio, in the same year he became a break-out star for What's Eating Gilbert Grape, stars as Wolff, a teenager who moves all around the country with his mother (Ellen Barkin). They finally settle down in Concrete, Washington when Barkin falls for a mechanic (Robert De Niro). After the two marry, De Niro quickly reveals his true colors: he's a petulant, petty jerk. In particular, he treats DiCaprio like total crap. He has three kids of his own (including a young Carla Gugino and Eliza Dushku), and he treats them well enough, but he feels jealous of DiCaprio. He's severely emotionally abusive toward him and even physically so when pushed. DiCaprio, who isn't exactly a good kid, gets his life straighter, seemingly just to spite his stepfather. DiCaprio was quite good in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but, for my money, his talent shines through here much more in a less showy role. I think most people have known a guy just like De Niro's character, and he's very good here. Barkin is also quite good. Jonah Blechman is also very good as DiCaprio's gay buddy. Tobey Maguire appears in his first credited role.

    Tobias (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his mother Caroline (Ellen Barkin) are at loose ends after Caroline's divorce. Caroline has the get rich scheme of heading for uranium mining out west. After this and other other ideas fail, Caroline and Tobias wind up in Concrete, Washington (yes, it actually exists) where they are getting desperate. In steps Dwight, a local mechanic. Dwight seems sincere in his courting of Caroline and, since he offers stability and security, Caroline is willing to buy what he is offering by marrying him. After the marriage Dwight's dark side surfaces in the major conflict that develops between him and Tobias. Tobias is no angel, but to me his behavior was no more out of line than that of your typical rebellious youth, whereas Dwight's tyrannical behavior struck me as bordering on the sadistic. The scenes of physical abuse I found hard to watch. Why Dwight's reaction to Tobias is so extreme is open to speculation. In part I think it comes from Dwight's perception of what it means to be a man--you are the ultimate authority, one who brooks no opposition. Expanding on that theme, Dwight senses that Tobias is not living up to his stereotypical image, for example Tobias likes to read books of all things. In some ways I got the feeling that Dwight's behavior was not all malicious; some small part of him felt for Tobias and he was trying to impose his vision on him as how to deal with the world. However, there is one pivotal scene that said a lot about Dwight to me. While Dwight and Tobias were watching television a news report came on about Lana Turner's daughter Cheryl Crane murdering Turner's boyfriend Johnny Stompanato, on the grounds that he was brutalizing her mother. Crane was acquitted on the grounds of justifiable homicide. When that last piece of information was mentioned, Dwight looked over at Tobias (who was paying intense attention to the program) with a look that said, "Hmmmm, could this apply to me?" This indicated to me that Dwight knew he had gone over the line in his dealings with Tobias and maybe would pay the ultimate price. The movie takes place in the late 1950s and period details are inserted in order to make that point: cars, hair styles, clothes, TV, movies, music. De Niro is good here--I think you have to be a good actor to play such a thoroughly unlikeable bully as Dwight with such convincing realism. It is no small treat to see De Niro dressed in a scout uniform. Barkin is fine, but Caroline moves to deep background once the major struggle between Dwight and Tobias takes center stage. DiCaprio turns in a particularly good performance, being able to hold his own against two experienced actors. This is billed as a true story, being an accounting of author Tobias Wollf's experiences. I think this should more appropriately be labeled as based on truth, since there are some things that don't ring quite true. For example, the scene that has Tobias running a table saw in shop class at school is wrong. Not even the most inexperienced novice in a wood class would be passing the wood through the saw in the dangerous way that Tobias was. I was cringing just to watch it. And the injury we see he sustains could in no way be caused by the accident as pictured, at the least it would have been more serious. And there was no purpose to what he was doing with the saw to start with. After seeing this I wondered just how well the rest of the movie had been researched. To say that something is a true story is risky--not even most documentaries are without bias. What an author says in an autobiographical text has to be taken with some reservations as to the truth I am left wanting to read the book, since I am sure the relationships are more complicated than what can be presented here in two hours. We don't get to know Caroline very well, and how Dwight's kids from a previous marriage fit into the family is hardly treated. In particular I wanted to know more about Dwight's relationship with the other kids, especially with his son. More details on Tobias' relationship with the effeminate Arthur would be interesting--how did he square that relationship with his other tough friends? Was Arthur as stereotypically gay as shown? Overall I found this to be well acted and absorbing. It reminds me of the father/son battle waged in the 1979 movie, "The Great Santini."

    "You'll never forget me!" shouts an angry Dwight to Tobias and his mother when they're finally leaving the house of so many haunting memories. That's probably the only true thing he ever said, and the proof is, Tobias Wolff, the author wrote a novel about the Dwight years, adapted in 1993 by Michael Caton-Jones. And I remember having seen the film many years ago, before "Titanic", before all Leonardo Di Caprio's adult roles, I didn't forget Dwight, played by De Niro, but I didn't forget Leo either. "This Boy's Life" is the chronicle of Tobias Wolff's teenage days, when his nomadic mother, played by the a sensual Ellen Barkin, decided to go west, the land of greener grasses. She looks for a job, a roof, a school for her boy, but marrying a man would provide everything she needs in once, and a fatherly figure, an extra Tobias severely needs. Finally, in a small town, conveniently named 'Concrete', she meets Dwight, a divorced father with three children, whose gallantry and gentleness don't fool Tobias. His suspicions are immediately confirmed when Dwight confronts him in the car and dares him to ever try to mock him. The character is set, and De Niro here plays one of his most underrated and memorable villainous roles as a bully so blinded by his inferiority complex he doesn't realize he's only venting his anger on Tobias. De Niro maintains a puzzling mix of genuine authority or pathetic craziness that we're never quite sure about his intentions, and even the mother, while feeling the aggressiveness, still believes he can be a model for Tobias. Naturally, as the movie progresses, Dwight's actions get more and more explicit about how cruel and abusive he is, each of his seemingly good actions are followed by a treachery. He encourages Tobias to deliver newspapers yet he steals his money, he buys him a dog, but sells his Winchester to get the money, he registers him to the scout but can't buy him a proper suit, or shoes to play baskets, he teaches him to fight yet only seems to enjoy his towering position to humiliate him. All the film is a succession of conflictual situations between Dwight and Toby, and as soon as De Niro emerges on screen, Barkin dissolves in his shadow. Less than an underusing, it illustrates the fact that she accepts her fate, and choose a neutral position: she doesn't want to be the 'umpire', a wise move that probably avoids an aggravation, since she also endures Dwight complex in bed and makes her only involvement more significant and crucial to the story, which ends in the most cheerful way. Dwight is a dark and unforgettable parenthesis in Tobias' life that marked him forever. We can feel it by the level of emotion displayed by Tobis when he finally escaped from him, yet at this moment, we can't help but feel sorry for De Niro, who as douche-bag as he was, couldn't hide his vulnerability and an obvious insecurity. Only an actor like De Niro could have inspired so many contradictory reactions  and I guess a part of the credit is to the directing, and the storytelling. "This Boy's Life" features many difficult parts, the injustice, the bullying, starting with the most random things like toothpaste, mustard, and it's so futile that you can't doubt that it's true, but it doesn't overdo the pathos, and even translates it into comedy. When De Niro and Leo take the picture in the scout camp, you can't help but smile at the discomposure in Toby's face with De Niro's trademark grin. And the 'comedy' aspect also relies on Toby's capability to resist Dwight's pressure, sometimes he accepts it, he does in the beginning, but as he gets older and grows more rebel, he responds to him, even laugh at him, almost not realizing that he's being influenced by him. On that level, the film features many other subplots, involving a friendship with Arthur Gayle, an ambiguously homosexual who seems infatuated on Toby, and later, he has the feeling that it's Dwight's voice speaking in him, and Toby realizes he might have been molded the worst way, with the only choice being becoming Dwight or like his losers friends. His only chance of escape is to apply for prep schools with the help of Arthur to get the teacher's favors. The conflict between Dwight and Toby is the core of the film, and no matter how powerful is De Niro, Leo is capable to steal the show, to take him face to face, and when a young snotty punk like him can take it from the guy who was already a legend you know there's something promising in this talent. And it's no wonder that Leo was nominated the same year for 'Gilbert Grape'. In my recent reviews, I've been very critical toward Leonardo Di Caprio especially the way he was typecast as a macho tough lead, while there was more to exploit in his angelic face. That's true, I've never bought him as a tough guy, maybe because I didn't want to, maybe because I thought there was a lot of potential wasted, he could have more interesting roles. "The Aviator" was my favorite of his 'recent' roles and I'm still waiting to see "Django Unchained", till that day, all I can do is revisit his performance and "This Boy's Life", and the unforgettable breakdown part, his shout in the mountains finally exorcising the deliverance of getting rid of Dwight, such a communicative moment, or his Eddie Cochran in the car (the scene I remembered the most&agrave;) and put my unfair bias into perspective.

    As time goes by, I'm starting to realize how much of a talent Di Caprio was in his youth. I wonder what went wrong... I also ponder upon a question why movies like "This Boy's Life" don't hit the big screen anymore? When did film making become a shallow business with it's only interest in profits. "This Boy's Life" is anything but a classic Hollywood blockbuster. It's a slice of life presented both in it's best and worst. And life is not like a film either... Being young, smart and trapped in a behindhand environment is tough, often frustrating and inhibiting. It's a first major battle in a war called survival, a battle that would set a young man on it's way and pave the road to his future. Being alone in such a struggle is not easy, and young Toby Wolff would feel it on his skin quite some. Well, maybe not completely alone. Toby's mother tries hard to soldier on in life, and yet, she lacks the energy and will to make that final push. In the absence of a father figure, fourteen year old Tobias endeavors to model himself on his own, fighting not only his inner demons, but also a harsh, inert and primitive surrounding portrayed in the character of Dwigh and the village of Concrete. Will he succeed and break away? It's all in his hands... The entire cast made a remarkable job - Di Caprio for one, followed by Ellen Barkin and Robert De Niro, as well as rest of the team. A tribute would also deservedly go to all of the technical crew, scriptwriter and director. Even without the real-life reference at the end, it's quite obvious this story was written by life itself, which makes it that special and unique. "This Boy's Life" is a good story well portrayed, and as such it rightfully earns it's 10 points. More flicks like this, please! This also presents a small jubilee, since it is my 50th review here on IMDb (including the needlessly removed one). Cheers!

This Boy's Life is incredible, it is absolutely incredibly, it is a powerful an incredibly movie drama that benefits from great directing and powerful performances. I was really surprised at how great this movie was, I was expecting it to be a good movie, but I wasn't expecting it to be a "great" movie, and it is a great movie, it really and truly is. I honestly believe that this is one of the best movies of the last 25 years, it really is that powerful of a movie, it is powerful, touching, moving, and there are a few parts that just might leave you with some tears in your eyes.

It could make you not even want to see the movie. That being said, this movie is a total gem! It was a boring, hot, sunny afternoon and there was absolutely nothing to watch on television. I was literally flipping through channels when somewhere along the line I decided that a slow paced, uncomfortable, movie about child abuse on Showcase would do. I soon realized that the child being abused was Leonardo DiCaprio and the person doing the abusing was none other than Robert De Niro. This movie is pretty much non- stop action, and by action I mean child abuse. If you hate Robert De Niro this may not be a good movie for you to watch because it will make you hate him even more. This Boy's Life is an incredibly thorough movie; all the main groups of abuse are represented: emotional, physical, psychological and even financial abuses are present throughout. One of the best scenes is when Robert De Niro crams an old mustard jar into Leonardo DiCaprio's eye to teach him a lesson about wasting condiments. This movie has it all, sad drunk driving, awkward gay teens and a bulldog! The sad fact is this movie is actually based on a true story. But, I prefer to forget that and just enjoy the ride.

    There are times when you get sad and the task at hand seems so hard. What you don't realize is that there are people who have faced times harder, and done equally challenging things. This story is one such narrative of a boy from a small town with a mother trying to get settled somewhere. As the attempts of settling at a new city goes on, she meets a guy(de niro). It is via this guy that she realizes that she could settle down for herself and her son (do caprio). As an when their lives get intertwined, di caprio faces angst from deniro and tries to get a future for himself out of the small town. This is his struggle to learn, to get a direction and to survive! Follow Tobias Wolff's memoir into his journey beyond the brutality and the hopelessness. For all the depth, I give this movie an 8 on 10

    Wow. This was a harsh film, but a damn good one at that. What is more amazing about this movie is that it is based on the memoirs of the real Tobias Wolf! It's a true story, and that made it all the more better while viewing this one. I cannot state how unpleasant this movie can be at times. The stuff Jack (Tobias) has to endure is really heart wrenching, and there were a few moments where I actually gasped out loud. It's not very often a movie can grip me with complete astonishment, but this managed to do just that. I give a lot of credit to the ensemble performances. Leo DiCaprio is astonishing for a kid at his age at this juncture. He is solely responsible for taking me on a journey I won't soon forget. He is sympathetic, very vulnerable, and I was able to empathize with him all the way. You will feel desperation when it comes to some of his scenes. Robert DeNiro plays one of the most brazen, and detestable characters I have ever seen. He is often terrifying as Dwight. DeNiro is credited for many amazing roles and rightfully so, but this one is shockingly neglected a lot of the time when it comes to his resume. What a chilling performance! Ellen Barkin is exceptionally good as the clueless, yet likable Mother. She may make you wanna slap her one at times, but you'll lover her for the most part, i'm sure. Eliza Dushku, Tobey Maguire, among others have small roles here. Final Thoughts: It's a hard film to review without revealing so much. It's a fantastic, if draining experience. If you're in the mood for an excellent heavy drama, I would choose this one without question. It'll stay with you after it is over 9/10

    Moving adaptation of Tobias Wolff's memoir. Leonardo DiCaprio, in the same year he became a break-out star for What's Eating Gilbert Grape, stars as Wolff, a teenager who moves all around the country with his mother (Ellen Barkin). They finally settle down in Concrete, Washington when Barkin falls for a mechanic (Robert De Niro). After the two marry, De Niro quickly reveals his true colors: he's a petulant, petty jerk. In particular, he treats DiCaprio like total crap. He has three kids of his own (including a young Carla Gugino and Eliza Dushku), and he treats them well enough, but he feels jealous of DiCaprio. He's severely emotionally abusive toward him and even physically so when pushed. DiCaprio, who isn't exactly a good kid, gets his life straighter, seemingly just to spite his stepfather. DiCaprio was quite good in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but, for my money, his talent shines through here much more in a less showy role. I think most people have known a guy just like De Niro's character, and he's very good here. Barkin is also quite good. Jonah Blechman is also very good as DiCaprio's gay buddy. Tobey Maguire appears in his first credited role.

    Tobias (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his mother Caroline (Ellen Barkin) are at loose ends after Caroline's divorce. Caroline has the get rich scheme of heading for uranium mining out west. After this and other other ideas fail, Caroline and Tobias wind up in Concrete, Washington (yes, it actually exists) where they are getting desperate. In steps Dwight, a local mechanic. Dwight seems sincere in his courting of Caroline and, since he offers stability and security, Caroline is willing to buy what he is offering by marrying him. After the marriage Dwight's dark side surfaces in the major conflict that develops between him and Tobias. Tobias is no angel, but to me his behavior was no more out of line than that of your typical rebellious youth, whereas Dwight's tyrannical behavior struck me as bordering on the sadistic. The scenes of physical abuse I found hard to watch. Why Dwight's reaction to Tobias is so extreme is open to speculation. In part I think it comes from Dwight's perception of what it means to be a man--you are the ultimate authority, one who brooks no opposition. Expanding on that theme, Dwight senses that Tobias is not living up to his stereotypical image, for example Tobias likes to read books of all things. In some ways I got the feeling that Dwight's behavior was not all malicious; some small part of him felt for Tobias and he was trying to impose his vision on him as how to deal with the world. However, there is one pivotal scene that said a lot about Dwight to me. While Dwight and Tobias were watching television a news report came on about Lana Turner's daughter Cheryl Crane murdering Turner's boyfriend Johnny Stompanato, on the grounds that he was brutalizing her mother. Crane was acquitted on the grounds of justifiable homicide. When that last piece of information was mentioned, Dwight looked over at Tobias (who was paying intense attention to the program) with a look that said, "Hmmmm, could this apply to me?" This indicated to me that Dwight knew he had gone over the line in his dealings with Tobias and maybe would pay the ultimate price. The movie takes place in the late 1950s and period details are inserted in order to make that point: cars, hair styles, clothes, TV, movies, music. De Niro is good here--I think you have to be a good actor to play such a thoroughly unlikeable bully as Dwight with such convincing realism. It is no small treat to see De Niro dressed in a scout uniform. Barkin is fine, but Caroline moves to deep background once the major struggle between Dwight and Tobias takes center stage. DiCaprio turns in a particularly good performance, being able to hold his own against two experienced actors. This is billed as a true story, being an accounting of author Tobias Wollf's experiences. I think this should more appropriately be labeled as based on truth, since there are some things that don't ring quite true. For example, the scene that has Tobias running a table saw in shop class at school is wrong. Not even the most inexperienced novice in a wood class would be passing the wood through the saw in the dangerous way that Tobias was. I was cringing just to watch it. And the injury we see he sustains could in no way be caused by the accident as pictured, at the least it would have been more serious. And there was no purpose to what he was doing with the saw to start with. After seeing this I wondered just how well the rest of the movie had been researched. To say that something is a true story is risky--not even most documentaries are without bias. What an author says in an autobiographical text has to be taken with some reservations as to the truth I am left wanting to read the book, since I am sure the relationships are more complicated than what can be presented here in two hours. We don't get to know Caroline very well, and how Dwight's kids from a previous marriage fit into the family is hardly treated. In particular I wanted to know more about Dwight's relationship with the other kids, especially with his son. More details on Tobias' relationship with the effeminate Arthur would be interesting--how did he square that relationship with his other tough friends? Was Arthur as stereotypically gay as shown? Overall I found this to be well acted and absorbing. It reminds me of the father/son battle waged in the 1979 movie, "The Great Santini."

    "You'll never forget me!" shouts an angry Dwight to Tobias and his mother when they're finally leaving the house of so many haunting memories. That's probably the only true thing he ever said, and the proof is, Tobias Wolff, the author wrote a novel about the Dwight years, adapted in 1993 by Michael Caton-Jones. And I remember having seen the film many years ago, before "Titanic", before all Leonardo Di Caprio's adult roles, I didn't forget Dwight, played by De Niro, but I didn't forget Leo either. "This Boy's Life" is the chronicle of Tobias Wolff's teenage days, when his nomadic mother, played by the a sensual Ellen Barkin, decided to go west, the land of greener grasses. She looks for a job, a roof, a school for her boy, but marrying a man would provide everything she needs in once, and a fatherly figure, an extra Tobias severely needs. Finally, in a small town, conveniently named 'Concrete', she meets Dwight, a divorced father with three children, whose gallantry and gentleness don't fool Tobias. His suspicions are immediately confirmed when Dwight confronts him in the car and dares him to ever try to mock him. The character is set, and De Niro here plays one of his most underrated and memorable villainous roles as a bully so blinded by his inferiority complex he doesn't realize he's only venting his anger on Tobias. De Niro maintains a puzzling mix of genuine authority or pathetic craziness that we're never quite sure about his intentions, and even the mother, while feeling the aggressiveness, still believes he can be a model for Tobias. Naturally, as the movie progresses, Dwight's actions get more and more explicit about how cruel and abusive he is, each of his seemingly good actions are followed by a treachery. He encourages Tobias to deliver newspapers yet he steals his money, he buys him a dog, but sells his Winchester to get the money, he registers him to the scout but can't buy him a proper suit, or shoes to play baskets, he teaches him to fight yet only seems to enjoy his towering position to humiliate him. All the film is a succession of conflictual situations between Dwight and Toby, and as soon as De Niro emerges on screen, Barkin dissolves in his shadow. Less than an underusing, it illustrates the fact that she accepts her fate, and choose a neutral position: she doesn't want to be the 'umpire', a wise move that probably avoids an aggravation, since she also endures Dwight complex in bed and makes her only involvement more significant and crucial to the story, which ends in the most cheerful way. Dwight is a dark and unforgettable parenthesis in Tobias' life that marked him forever. We can feel it by the level of emotion displayed by Tobis when he finally escaped from him, yet at this moment, we can't help but feel sorry for De Niro, who as douche-bag as he was, couldn't hide his vulnerability and an obvious insecurity. Only an actor like De Niro could have inspired so many contradictory reactions  and I guess a part of the credit is to the directing, and the storytelling. "This Boy's Life" features many difficult parts, the injustice, the bullying, starting with the most random things like toothpaste, mustard, and it's so futile that you can't doubt that it's true, but it doesn't overdo the pathos, and even translates it into comedy. When De Niro and Leo take the picture in the scout camp, you can't help but smile at the discomposure in Toby's face with De Niro's trademark grin. And the 'comedy' aspect also relies on Toby's capability to resist Dwight's pressure, sometimes he accepts it, he does in the beginning, but as he gets older and grows more rebel, he responds to him, even laugh at him, almost not realizing that he's being influenced by him. On that level, the film features many other subplots, involving a friendship with Arthur Gayle, an ambiguously homosexual who seems infatuated on Toby, and later, he has the feeling that it's Dwight's voice speaking in him, and Toby realizes he might have been molded the worst way, with the only choice being becoming Dwight or like his losers friends. His only chance of escape is to apply for prep schools with the help of Arthur to get the teacher's favors. The conflict between Dwight and Toby is the core of the film, and no matter how powerful is De Niro, Leo is capable to steal the show, to take him face to face, and when a young snotty punk like him can take it from the guy who was already a legend you know there's something promising in this talent. And it's no wonder that Leo was nominated the same year for 'Gilbert Grape'. In my recent reviews, I've been very critical toward Leonardo Di Caprio especially the way he was typecast as a macho tough lead, while there was more to exploit in his angelic face. That's true, I've never bought him as a tough guy, maybe because I didn't want to, maybe because I thought there was a lot of potential wasted, he could have more interesting roles. "The Aviator" was my favorite of his 'recent' roles and I'm still waiting to see "Django Unchained", till that day, all I can do is revisit his performance and "This Boy's Life", and the unforgettable breakdown part, his shout in the mountains finally exorcising the deliverance of getting rid of Dwight, such a communicative moment, or his Eddie Cochran in the car (the scene I remembered the most&agrave;) and put my unfair bias into perspective.

    As time goes by, I'm starting to realize how much of a talent Di Caprio was in his youth. I wonder what went wrong... I also ponder upon a question why movies like "This Boy's Life" don't hit the big screen anymore? When did film making become a shallow business with it's only interest in profits. "This Boy's Life" is anything but a classic Hollywood blockbuster. It's a slice of life presented both in it's best and worst. And life is not like a film either... Being young, smart and trapped in a behindhand environment is tough, often frustrating and inhibiting. It's a first major battle in a war called survival, a battle that would set a young man on it's way and pave the road to his future. Being alone in such a struggle is not easy, and young Toby Wolff would feel it on his skin quite some. Well, maybe not completely alone. Toby's mother tries hard to soldier on in life, and yet, she lacks the energy and will to make that final push. In the absence of a father figure, fourteen year old Tobias endeavors to model himself on his own, fighting not only his inner demons, but also a harsh, inert and primitive surrounding portrayed in the character of Dwigh and the village of Concrete. Will he succeed and break away? It's all in his hands... The entire cast made a remarkable job - Di Caprio for one, followed by Ellen Barkin and Robert De Niro, as well as rest of the team. A tribute would also deservedly go to all of the technical crew, scriptwriter and director. Even without the real-life reference at the end, it's quite obvious this story was written by life itself, which makes it that special and unique. "This Boy's Life" is a good story well portrayed, and as such it rightfully earns it's 10 points. More flicks like this, please! This also presents a small jubilee, since it is my 50th review here on IMDb (including the needlessly removed one). Cheers!

    The story about the relationship between a rebellious 50s teenager and his abusive father, based on the memoirs of writer and literature professor Tobias Wolff. This Boy's Life is incredible, it is absolutely incredibly, it is a powerful an incredibly movie drama that benefits from great directing and powerful performances. I was really surprised at how great this movie was, I was expecting it to be a good movie, but I wasn't expecting it to be a "great" movie, and it is a great movie, it really and truly is. I honestly believe that this is one of the best movies of the last 25 years, it really is that powerful of a movie, it is powerful, touching, moving, and there are a few parts that just might leave you with some tears in your eyes. This Boy's Life is a movie that you will probably have to watch more than once just because of how great it is. If you want to see how great a movie can get, then watch this movie, because it will show you just how great a movie can get. I love this movie, it's honestly one of the best movies that I've seen in a very long time. Let's talk about some of the acting, shall we? Yes lets. In one of his major breakthrough roles, Leonardo DiCaprio gives a marvelous performance as the main character, who suffers a torrent of verbal, emotional, and physical abuse at the hands of his monster of a stepfather, played by the always fabulous Robert De Niro. I also liked the performance of Jonah Blechman, who plays Arthur Gayle, a person who DiCaprio's character doesn't get along with at first, but eventually becomes good friends with. Robert De Niro's performance as the horrid stepfather is a great one, but while he was great, Leonardo DiCaprio gets the most praise from me, for being a young adult at the time he made this movie, he was certainly phenomenal in the role he played. To make an extremely long story short, everyone who starred in this movie did a great job, especially Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. In short, This Boy's Life is one of the best movies that I've seen in a very, very, very long time, it's spectacular, marvelous, fabulous, and unforgettable. I expected De Niro to be good in this movie, as I absolutely adore the man, but I didn't like the movie just because he was in it, I liked it for a lot of other reason as well, such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Blechman. If you haven't seen this movie, then you've got to see it, because there is an extremely high chance that you will love it. You will laugh, you will cry, you will cheer, you will be thrilled with what you will watch. This Boy's Life is a movie that will last, it will never grow old, it will remain a great movie until the end of time, it is not only one of the best I've seen, but it is also one of the best of both Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. So if you haven't seen this movie yet, then watch it, because the chances are you will really, really, really enjoy it. 10/10

    I read the book so many times. Even knew there was a movie about it I had read and re read the book. I loved Tobias Wolff's writing. I think a major reason I didn't like it was because the book had so much to offer. It felt as though there wasn't enough depth in the movie. The movie was good no doubt. I am not a fan of Leonardo Di caprio. However, he did do a good job in this movie. I could think of no one better who could play the role of father as well as Robert De Niro did... Overall it was good and I wouldn't mind watching it again. Though I would prefer reading it again a lot more. Which is a lot for me to say because I do prefer movies a lot more than books. (sorry)

    A single mother and her difficult son find family life isn't necessarily all it's cracked up to be in this film.This Boy's Life is a film adaptation of the memoir of the same name by Tobias Wolff. It is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and it features Leonardo DiCaprio as Tobias Wolff together with Robert De Niro and Ellen Barkin. The film also co-stars Chris Cooper,Carla Gugino,Eliza Dushku and Tobey Maguire in a small role. Nomadic, flaky Caroline just wants to settle down in one place, find a decent guy, and provide a better home for her handful of a son, Toby. When she moves to Seattle and meets the respectful, respectable Dwight Hansen, she thinks she's got it made. Toby, however, feels differently after spending a few months with Dwight and his children and away from Caroline. The boy's stepfather-to-be seems to want to mold Toby into a better person, but to do so he emotionally, verbally, and physically abuses the kid. The marriage proceeds, and soon Caroline, too, recognizes Dwight's need to dominate everyone around him. She sticks with it, though, convinced it's the best thing for her son, and several years of dysfunction ensue. During this time, Tobias befriends another misfit, the possibly homosexual young Arthur Gayle, while continuing to chafe under the yoke of his repressive stepfather.Hoping to leave Concrete and live with his older brother Gregory, Toby decides to apply for east-coast prep-school scholarships. Realizing his grades are not adequate to apply, Toby devises a plan to submit falsified grade reports. Meanwhile, the friendship between Arthur and Toby becomes strained when Arthur confronts Toby regarding his behavior; Arthur tells Toby he is acting more and more like Dwight and asks Toby, "why should you be the one who gets to leave?" Even so, Arthur helps his friend get the papers Toby needs to falsify his grade records and Toby sends in his prep-school applications. When Toby tells Arthur he can leave Concrete and have a better life too, Arthur tells him he will most likely stay. After numerous rejections, Toby is accepted to the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania with a full scholarship.At the end of the film following two years of marriage, Caroline defends Toby during a physically violent argument between her son and husband and they are both seen leaving Dwight and Concrete. This movie provided the first lead role for future superstar Leonardo DiCaprio. He steals the show in this tale of learning how to be a man, with a sly Robert De Niro also giving a good performance.It was a a compelling character study that is well worth watching despite of being too long and a plot that drags.It shows how a resilient teenager survives childhood trauma and adversity through independence, anger and creativity.In short,it is a powerful and compelling stuff that makes it a must-see.

This Boy's Life is an incredibly thorough movie; all the main groups of abuse are represented: emotional, physical, psychological and even financial abuses are present throughout. One of the best scenes is when Robert De Niro crams an old mustard jar into Leonardo DiCaprio's eye to teach him a lesson about wasting condiments. This movie has it all, sad drunk driving, awkward gay teens and a bulldog! The sad fact is this movie is actually based on a true story. But, I prefer to forget that and just enjoy the ride.

Tobias is no angel, but to me his behavior was no more out of line than that of your typical rebellious youth, whereas Dwight's tyrannical behavior struck me as bordering on the sadistic. The scenes of physical abuse I found hard to watch. Why Dwight's reaction to Tobias is so extreme is open to speculation. In part I think it comes from Dwight's perception of what it means to be a man--you are the ultimate authority, one who brooks no opposition. Expanding on that theme, Dwight senses that Tobias is not living up to his stereotypical image, for example Tobias likes to read books of all things. In some ways I got the feeling that Dwight's behavior was not all malicious; some small part of him felt for Tobias and he was trying to impose his vision on him as how to deal with the world. However, there is one pivotal scene that said a lot about Dwight to me. While Dwight and Tobias were watching television a news report came on about Lana Turner's daughter Cheryl Crane murdering Turner's boyfriend Johnny Stompanato, on the grounds that he was brutalizing her mother. Crane was acquitted on the grounds of justifiable homicide. When that last piece of information was mentioned, Dwight looked over at Tobias (who was paying intense attention to the program) with a look that said, "Hmmmm, could this apply to me?" This indicated to me that Dwight knew he had gone over the line in his dealings with Tobias and maybe would pay the ultimate price. The movie takes place in the late 1950s and period details are inserted in order to make that point: cars, hair styles, clothes, TV, movies, music. De Niro is good here--I think you have to be a good actor to play such a thoroughly unlikeable bully as Dwight with such convincing realism. It is no small treat to see De Niro dressed in a scout uniform. Barkin is fine, but Caroline moves to deep background once the major struggle between Dwight and Tobias takes center stage. DiCaprio turns in a particularly good performance, being able to hold his own against two experienced actors. This is billed as a true story, being an accounting of author Tobias Wollf's experiences. I think this should more appropriately be labeled as based on truth, since there are some things that don't ring quite true. For example, the scene that has Tobias running a table saw in shop class at school is wrong. Not even the most inexperienced novice in a wood class would be passing the wood through the saw in the dangerous way that Tobias was. I was cringing just to watch it. And the injury we see he sustains could in no way be caused by the accident as pictured, at the least it would have been more serious. And there was no purpose to what he was doing with the saw to start with. After seeing this I wondered just how well the rest of the movie had been researched. To say that something is a true story is risky--not even most documentaries are without bias. What an author says in an autobiographical text has to be taken with some reservations as to the truth I am left wanting to read the book, since I am sure the relationships are more complicated than what can be presented here in two hours. We don't get to know Caroline very well, and how Dwight's kids from a previous marriage fit into the family is hardly treated. In particular I wanted to know more about Dwight's relationship with the other kids, especially with his son. More details on Tobias' relationship with the effeminate Arthur would be interesting--how did he square that relationship with his other tough friends? Was Arthur as stereotypically gay as shown? Overall I found this to be well acted and absorbing. It reminds me of the father/son battle waged in the 1979 movie, "The Great Santini."

    "You'll never forget me!" shouts an angry Dwight to Tobias and his mother when they're finally leaving the house of so many haunting memories. That's probably the only true thing he ever said, and the proof is, Tobias Wolff, the author wrote a novel about the Dwight years, adapted in 1993 by Michael Caton-Jones. And I remember having seen the film many years ago, before "Titanic", before all Leonardo Di Caprio's adult roles, I didn't forget Dwight, played by De Niro, but I didn't forget Leo either. "This Boy's Life" is the chronicle of Tobias Wolff's teenage days, when his nomadic mother, played by the a sensual Ellen Barkin, decided to go west, the land of greener grasses. She looks for a job, a roof, a school for her boy, but marrying a man would provide everything she needs in once, and a fatherly figure, an extra Tobias severely needs. Finally, in a small town, conveniently named 'Concrete', she meets Dwight, a divorced father with three children, whose gallantry and gentleness don't fool Tobias. His suspicions are immediately confirmed when Dwight confronts him in the car and dares him to ever try to mock him. The character is set, and De Niro here plays one of his most underrated and memorable villainous roles as a bully so blinded by his inferiority complex he doesn't realize he's only venting his anger on Tobias. De Niro maintains a puzzling mix of genuine authority or pathetic craziness that we're never quite sure about his intentions, and even the mother, while feeling the aggressiveness, still believes he can be a model for Tobias. Naturally, as the movie progresses, Dwight's actions get more and more explicit about how cruel and abusive he is, each of his seemingly good actions are followed by a treachery. He encourages Tobias to deliver newspapers yet he steals his money, he buys him a dog, but sells his Winchester to get the money, he registers him to the scout but can't buy him a proper suit, or shoes to play baskets, he teaches him to fight yet only seems to enjoy his towering position to humiliate him. All the film is a succession of conflictual situations between Dwight and Toby, and as soon as De Niro emerges on screen, Barkin dissolves in his shadow. Less than an underusing, it illustrates the fact that she accepts her fate, and choose a neutral position: she doesn't want to be the 'umpire', a wise move that probably avoids an aggravation, since she also endures Dwight complex in bed and makes her only involvement more significant and crucial to the story, which ends in the most cheerful way. Dwight is a dark and unforgettable parenthesis in Tobias' life that marked him forever. We can feel it by the level of emotion displayed by Tobis when he finally escaped from him, yet at this moment, we can't help but feel sorry for De Niro, who as douche-bag as he was, couldn't hide his vulnerability and an obvious insecurity. Only an actor like De Niro could have inspired so many contradictory reactions  and I guess a part of the credit is to the directing, and the storytelling. "This Boy's Life" features many difficult parts, the injustice, the bullying, starting with the most random things like toothpaste, mustard, and it's so futile that you can't doubt that it's true, but it doesn't overdo the pathos, and even translates it into comedy. When De Niro and Leo take the picture in the scout camp, you can't help but smile at the discomposure in Toby's face with De Niro's trademark grin. And the 'comedy' aspect also relies on Toby's capability to resist Dwight's pressure, sometimes he accepts it, he does in the beginning, but as he gets older and grows more rebel, he responds to him, even laugh at him, almost not realizing that he's being influenced by him. On that level, the film features many other subplots, involving a friendship with Arthur Gayle, an ambiguously homosexual who seems infatuated on Toby, and later, he has the feeling that it's Dwight's voice speaking in him, and Toby realizes he might have been molded the worst way, with the only choice being becoming Dwight or like his losers friends. His only chance of escape is to apply for prep schools with the help of Arthur to get the teacher's favors. The conflict between Dwight and Toby is the core of the film, and no matter how powerful is De Niro, Leo is capable to steal the show, to take him face to face, and when a young snotty punk like him can take it from the guy who was already a legend you know there's something promising in this talent. And it's no wonder that Leo was nominated the same year for 'Gilbert Grape'. In my recent reviews, I've been very critical toward Leonardo Di Caprio especially the way he was typecast as a macho tough lead, while there was more to exploit in his angelic face. That's true, I've never bought him as a tough guy, maybe because I didn't want to, maybe because I thought there was a lot of potential wasted, he could have more interesting roles. "The Aviator" was my favorite of his 'recent' roles and I'm still waiting to see "Django Unchained", till that day, all I can do is revisit his performance and "This Boy's Life", and the unforgettable breakdown part, his shout in the mountains finally exorcising the deliverance of getting rid of Dwight, such a communicative moment, or his Eddie Cochran in the car (the scene I remembered the most&agrave;) and put my unfair bias into perspective.

    As time goes by, I'm starting to realize how much of a talent Di Caprio was in his youth. I wonder what went wrong... I also ponder upon a question why movies like "This Boy's Life" don't hit the big screen anymore? When did film making become a shallow business with it's only interest in profits. "This Boy's Life" is anything but a classic Hollywood blockbuster. It's a slice of life presented both in it's best and worst. And life is not like a film either... Being young, smart and trapped in a behindhand environment is tough, often frustrating and inhibiting. It's a first major battle in a war called survival, a battle that would set a young man on it's way and pave the road to his future. Being alone in such a struggle is not easy, and young Toby Wolff would feel it on his skin quite some. Well, maybe not completely alone. Toby's mother tries hard to soldier on in life, and yet, she lacks the energy and will to make that final push. In the absence of a father figure, fourteen year old Tobias endeavors to model himself on his own, fighting not only his inner demons, but also a harsh, inert and primitive surrounding portrayed in the character of Dwigh and the village of Concrete. Will he succeed and break away? It's all in his hands... The entire cast made a remarkable job - Di Caprio for one, followed by Ellen Barkin and Robert De Niro, as well as rest of the team. A tribute would also deservedly go to all of the technical crew, scriptwriter and director. Even without the real-life reference at the end, it's quite obvious this story was written by life itself, which makes it that special and unique. "This Boy's Life" is a good story well portrayed, and as such it rightfully earns it's 10 points. More flicks like this, please! This also presents a small jubilee, since it is my 50th review here on IMDb (including the needlessly removed one). Cheers!

    The story about the relationship between a rebellious 50s teenager and his abusive father, based on the memoirs of writer and literature professor Tobias Wolff. This Boy's Life is incredible, it is absolutely incredibly, it is a powerful an incredibly movie drama that benefits from great directing and powerful performances. I was really surprised at how great this movie was, I was expecting it to be a good movie, but I wasn't expecting it to be a "great" movie, and it is a great movie, it really and truly is. I honestly believe that this is one of the best movies of the last 25 years, it really is that powerful of a movie, it is powerful, touching, moving, and there are a few parts that just might leave you with some tears in your eyes. This Boy's Life is a movie that you will probably have to watch more than once just because of how great it is. If you want to see how great a movie can get, then watch this movie, because it will show you just how great a movie can get. I love this movie, it's honestly one of the best movies that I've seen in a very long time. Let's talk about some of the acting, shall we? Yes lets. In one of his major breakthrough roles, Leonardo DiCaprio gives a marvelous performance as the main character, who suffers a torrent of verbal, emotional, and physical abuse at the hands of his monster of a stepfather, played by the always fabulous Robert De Niro. I also liked the performance of Jonah Blechman, who plays Arthur Gayle, a person who DiCaprio's character doesn't get along with at first, but eventually becomes good friends with. Robert De Niro's performance as the horrid stepfather is a great one, but while he was great, Leonardo DiCaprio gets the most praise from me, for being a young adult at the time he made this movie, he was certainly phenomenal in the role he played. To make an extremely long story short, everyone who starred in this movie did a great job, especially Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. In short, This Boy's Life is one of the best movies that I've seen in a very, very, very long time, it's spectacular, marvelous, fabulous, and unforgettable. I expected De Niro to be good in this movie, as I absolutely adore the man, but I didn't like the movie just because he was in it, I liked it for a lot of other reason as well, such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Blechman. If you haven't seen this movie, then you've got to see it, because there is an extremely high chance that you will love it. You will laugh, you will cry, you will cheer, you will be thrilled with what you will watch. This Boy's Life is a movie that will last, it will never grow old, it will remain a great movie until the end of time, it is not only one of the best I've seen, but it is also one of the best of both Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. So if you haven't seen this movie yet, then watch it, because the chances are you will really, really, really enjoy it. 10/10

    I read the book so many times. Even knew there was a movie about it I had read and re read the book. I loved Tobias Wolff's writing. I think a major reason I didn't like it was because the book had so much to offer. It felt as though there wasn't enough depth in the movie. The movie was good no doubt. I am not a fan of Leonardo Di caprio. However, he did do a good job in this movie. I could think of no one better who could play the role of father as well as Robert De Niro did... Overall it was good and I wouldn't mind watching it again. Though I would prefer reading it again a lot more. Which is a lot for me to say because I do prefer movies a lot more than books. (sorry)

    A single mother and her difficult son find family life isn't necessarily all it's cracked up to be in this film.This Boy's Life is a film adaptation of the memoir of the same name by Tobias Wolff. It is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and it features Leonardo DiCaprio as Tobias Wolff together with Robert De Niro and Ellen Barkin. The film also co-stars Chris Cooper,Carla Gugino,Eliza Dushku and Tobey Maguire in a small role. Nomadic, flaky Caroline just wants to settle down in one place, find a decent guy, and provide a better home for her handful of a son, Toby. When she moves to Seattle and meets the respectful, respectable Dwight Hansen, she thinks she's got it made. Toby, however, feels differently after spending a few months with Dwight and his children and away from Caroline. The boy's stepfather-to-be seems to want to mold Toby into a better person, but to do so he emotionally, verbally, and physically abuses the kid. The marriage proceeds, and soon Caroline, too, recognizes Dwight's need to dominate everyone around him. She sticks with it, though, convinced it's the best thing for her son, and several years of dysfunction ensue. During this time, Tobias befriends another misfit, the possibly homosexual young Arthur Gayle, while continuing to chafe under the yoke of his repressive stepfather.Hoping to leave Concrete and live with his older brother Gregory, Toby decides to apply for east-coast prep-school scholarships. Realizing his grades are not adequate to apply, Toby devises a plan to submit falsified grade reports. Meanwhile, the friendship between Arthur and Toby becomes strained when Arthur confronts Toby regarding his behavior; Arthur tells Toby he is acting more and more like Dwight and asks Toby, "why should you be the one who gets to leave?" Even so, Arthur helps his friend get the papers Toby needs to falsify his grade records and Toby sends in his prep-school applications. When Toby tells Arthur he can leave Concrete and have a better life too, Arthur tells him he will most likely stay. After numerous rejections, Toby is accepted to the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania with a full scholarship.At the end of the film following two years of marriage, Caroline defends Toby during a physically violent argument between her son and husband and they are both seen leaving Dwight and Concrete. This movie provided the first lead role for future superstar Leonardo DiCaprio. He steals the show in this tale of learning how to be a man, with a sly Robert De Niro also giving a good performance.It was a a compelling character study that is well worth watching despite of being too long and a plot that drags.It shows how a resilient teenager survives childhood trauma and adversity through independence, anger and creativity.In short,it is a powerful and compelling stuff that makes it a must-see.

    This Boys Life A Review by Ashley "I SEE YOUR SPOTS LEOPARD!" If I were to explain to you what this movie is actually about it would really put you off. It could make you not even want to see the movie. That being said, this movie is a total gem! It was a boring, hot, sunny afternoon and there was absolutely nothing to watch on television. I was literally flipping through channels when somewhere along the line I decided that a slow paced, uncomfortable, movie about child abuse on Showcase would do. I soon realized that the child being abused was Leonardo DiCaprio and the person doing the abusing was none other than Robert De Niro. This movie is pretty much non- stop action, and by action I mean child abuse. If you hate Robert De Niro this may not be a good movie for you to watch because it will make you hate him even more. This Boy's Life is an incredibly thorough movie; all the main groups of abuse are represented: emotional, physical, psychological and even financial abuses are present throughout. One of the best scenes is when Robert De Niro crams an old mustard jar into Leonardo DiCaprio's eye to teach him a lesson about wasting condiments. This movie has it all, sad drunk driving, awkward gay teens and a bulldog! The sad fact is this movie is actually based on a true story. But, I prefer to forget that and just enjoy the ride.

    There are times when you get sad and the task at hand seems so hard. What you don't realize is that there are people who have faced times harder, and done equally challenging things. This story is one such narrative of a boy from a small town with a mother trying to get settled somewhere. As the attempts of settling at a new city goes on, she meets a guy(de niro). It is via this guy that she realizes that she could settle down for herself and her son (do caprio). As an when their lives get intertwined, di caprio faces angst from deniro and tries to get a future for himself out of the small town. This is his struggle to learn, to get a direction and to survive! Follow Tobias Wolff's memoir into his journey beyond the brutality and the hopelessness. For all the depth, I give this movie an 8 on 10

    Wow. This was a harsh film, but a damn good one at that. What is more amazing about this movie is that it is based on the memoirs of the real Tobias Wolf! It's a true story, and that made it all the more better while viewing this one. I cannot state how unpleasant this movie can be at times. The stuff Jack (Tobias) has to endure is really heart wrenching, and there were a few moments where I actually gasped out loud. It's not very often a movie can grip me with complete astonishment, but this managed to do just that. I give a lot of credit to the ensemble performances. Leo DiCaprio is astonishing for a kid at his age at this juncture. He is solely responsible for taking me on a journey I won't soon forget. He is sympathetic, very vulnerable, and I was able to empathize with him all the way. You will feel desperation when it comes to some of his scenes. Robert DeNiro plays one of the most brazen, and detestable characters I have ever seen. He is often terrifying as Dwight. DeNiro is credited for many amazing roles and rightfully so, but this one is shockingly neglected a lot of the time when it comes to his resume. What a chilling performance! Ellen Barkin is exceptionally good as the clueless, yet likable Mother. She may make you wanna slap her one at times, but you'll lover her for the most part, i'm sure. Eliza Dushku, Tobey Maguire, among others have small roles here. Final Thoughts: It's a hard film to review without revealing so much. It's a fantastic, if draining experience. If you're in the mood for an excellent heavy drama, I would choose this one without question. It'll stay with you after it is over 9/10

    Moving adaptation of Tobias Wolff's memoir. Leonardo DiCaprio, in the same year he became a break-out star for What's Eating Gilbert Grape, stars as Wolff, a teenager who moves all around the country with his mother (Ellen Barkin). They finally settle down in Concrete, Washington when Barkin falls for a mechanic (Robert De Niro). After the two marry, De Niro quickly reveals his true colors: he's a petulant, petty jerk. In particular, he treats DiCaprio like total crap. He has three kids of his own (including a young Carla Gugino and Eliza Dushku), and he treats them well enough, but he feels jealous of DiCaprio. He's severely emotionally abusive toward him and even physically so when pushed. DiCaprio, who isn't exactly a good kid, gets his life straighter, seemingly just to spite his stepfather. DiCaprio was quite good in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but, for my money, his talent shines through here much more in a less showy role. I think most people have known a guy just like De Niro's character, and he's very good here. Barkin is also quite good. Jonah Blechman is also very good as DiCaprio's gay buddy. Tobey Maguire appears in his first credited role.

    Tobias (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his mother Caroline (Ellen Barkin) are at loose ends after Caroline's divorce. Caroline has the get rich scheme of heading for uranium mining out west. After this and other other ideas fail, Caroline and Tobias wind up in Concrete, Washington (yes, it actually exists) where they are getting desperate. In steps Dwight, a local mechanic. Dwight seems sincere in his courting of Caroline and, since he offers stability and security, Caroline is willing to buy what he is offering by marrying him. After the marriage Dwight's dark side surfaces in the major conflict that develops between him and Tobias. Tobias is no angel, but to me his behavior was no more out of line than that of your typical rebellious youth, whereas Dwight's tyrannical behavior struck me as bordering on the sadistic. The scenes of physical abuse I found hard to watch. Why Dwight's reaction to Tobias is so extreme is open to speculation. In part I think it comes from Dwight's perception of what it means to be a man--you are the ultimate authority, one who brooks no opposition. Expanding on that theme, Dwight senses that Tobias is not living up to his stereotypical image, for example Tobias likes to read books of all things. In some ways I got the feeling that Dwight's behavior was not all malicious; some small part of him felt for Tobias and he was trying to impose his vision on him as how to deal with the world. However, there is one pivotal scene that said a lot about Dwight to me. While Dwight and Tobias were watching television a news report came on about Lana Turner's daughter Cheryl Crane murdering Turner's boyfriend Johnny Stompanato, on the grounds that he was brutalizing her mother. Crane was acquitted on the grounds of justifiable homicide. When that last piece of information was mentioned, Dwight looked over at Tobias (who was paying intense attention to the program) with a look that said, "Hmmmm, could this apply to me?" This indicated to me that Dwight knew he had gone over the line in his dealings with Tobias and maybe would pay the ultimate price. The movie takes place in the late 1950s and period details are inserted in order to make that point: cars, hair styles, clothes, TV, movies, music. De Niro is good here--I think you have to be a good actor to play such a thoroughly unlikeable bully as Dwight with such convincing realism. It is no small treat to see De Niro dressed in a scout uniform. Barkin is fine, but Caroline moves to deep background once the major struggle between Dwight and Tobias takes center stage. DiCaprio turns in a particularly good performance, being able to hold his own against two experienced actors. This is billed as a true story, being an accounting of author Tobias Wollf's experiences. I think this should more appropriately be labeled as based on truth, since there are some things that don't ring quite true. For example, the scene that has Tobias running a table saw in shop class at school is wrong. Not even the most inexperienced novice in a wood class would be passing the wood through the saw in the dangerous way that Tobias was. I was cringing just to watch it. And the injury we see he sustains could in no way be caused by the accident as pictured, at the least it would have been more serious. And there was no purpose to what he was doing with the saw to start with. After seeing this I wondered just how well the rest of the movie had been researched. To say that something is a true story is risky--not even most documentaries are without bias. What an author says in an autobiographical text has to be taken with some reservations as to the truth I am left wanting to read the book, since I am sure the relationships are more complicated than what can be presented here in two hours. We don't get to know Caroline very well, and how Dwight's kids from a previous marriage fit into the family is hardly treated. In particular I wanted to know more about Dwight's relationship with the other kids, especially with his son.

When De Niro and Leo take the picture in the scout camp, you can't help but smile at the discomposure in Toby's face with De Niro's trademark grin. And the 'comedy' aspect also relies on Toby's capability to resist Dwight's pressure, sometimes he accepts it, he does in the beginning, but as he gets older and grows more rebel, he responds to him, even laugh at him, almost not realizing that he's being influenced by him. On that level, the film features many other subplots, involving a friendship with Arthur Gayle, an ambiguously homosexual who seems infatuated on Toby, and later, he has the feeling that it's Dwight's voice speaking in him, and Toby realizes he might have been molded the worst way, with the only choice being becoming Dwight or like his losers friends. His only chance of escape is to apply for prep schools with the help of Arthur to get the teacher's favors. The conflict between Dwight and Toby is the core of the film, and no matter how powerful is De Niro, Leo is capable to steal the show, to take him face to face, and when a young snotty punk like him can take it from the guy who was already a legend you know there's something promising in this talent. And it's no wonder that Leo was nominated the same year for 'Gilbert Grape'. In my recent reviews, I've been very critical toward Leonardo Di Caprio especially the way he was typecast as a macho tough lead, while there was more to exploit in his angelic face. That's true, I've never bought him as a tough guy, maybe because I didn't want to, maybe because I thought there was a lot of potential wasted, he could have more interesting roles. "The Aviator" was my favorite of his 'recent' roles and I'm still waiting to see "Django Unchained", till that day, all I can do is revisit his performance and "This Boy's Life", and the unforgettable breakdown part, his shout in the mountains finally exorcising the deliverance of getting rid of Dwight, such a communicative moment, or his Eddie Cochran in the car (the scene I remembered the most&agrave;) and put my unfair bias into perspective.

    As time goes by, I'm starting to realize how much of a talent Di Caprio was in his youth. I wonder what went wrong... I also ponder upon a question why movies like "This Boy's Life" don't hit the big screen anymore? When did film making become a shallow business with it's only interest in profits. "This Boy's Life" is anything but a classic Hollywood blockbuster. It's a slice of life presented both in it's best and worst. And life is not like a film either... Being young, smart and trapped in a behindhand environment is tough, often frustrating and inhibiting. It's a first major battle in a war called survival, a battle that would set a young man on it's way and pave the road to his future. Being alone in such a struggle is not easy, and young Toby Wolff would feel it on his skin quite some. Well, maybe not completely alone. Toby's mother tries hard to soldier on in life, and yet, she lacks the energy and will to make that final push. In the absence of a father figure, fourteen year old Tobias endeavors to model himself on his own, fighting not only his inner demons, but also a harsh, inert and primitive surrounding portrayed in the character of Dwigh and the village of Concrete. Will he succeed and break away? It's all in his hands... The entire cast made a remarkable job - Di Caprio for one, followed by Ellen Barkin and Robert De Niro, as well as rest of the team. A tribute would also deservedly go to all of the technical crew, scriptwriter and director. Even without the real-life reference at the end, it's quite obvious this story was written by life itself, which makes it that special and unique. "This Boy's Life" is a good story well portrayed, and as such it rightfully earns it's 10 points. More flicks like this, please! This also presents a small jubilee, since it is my 50th review here on IMDb (including the needlessly removed one). Cheers!

    The story about the relationship between a rebellious 50s teenager and his abusive father, based on the memoirs of writer and literature professor Tobias Wolff. This Boy's Life is incredible, it is absolutely incredibly, it is a powerful an incredibly movie drama that benefits from great directing and powerful performances. I was really surprised at how great this movie was, I was expecting it to be a good movie, but I wasn't expecting it to be a "great" movie, and it is a great movie, it really and truly is. I honestly believe that this is one of the best movies of the last 25 years, it really is that powerful of a movie, it is powerful, touching, moving, and there are a few parts that just might leave you with some tears in your eyes. This Boy's Life is a movie that you will probably have to watch more than once just because of how great it is. If you want to see how great a movie can get, then watch this movie, because it will show you just how great a movie can get. I love this movie, it's honestly one of the best movies that I've seen in a very long time. Let's talk about some of the acting, shall we? Yes lets. In one of his major breakthrough roles, Leonardo DiCaprio gives a marvelous performance as the main character, who suffers a torrent of verbal, emotional, and physical abuse at the hands of his monster of a stepfather, played by the always fabulous Robert De Niro. I also liked the performance of Jonah Blechman, who plays Arthur Gayle, a person who DiCaprio's character doesn't get along with at first, but eventually becomes good friends with. Robert De Niro's performance as the horrid stepfather is a great one, but while he was great, Leonardo DiCaprio gets the most praise from me, for being a young adult at the time he made this movie, he was certainly phenomenal in the role he played. To make an extremely long story short, everyone who starred in this movie did a great job, especially Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. In short, This Boy's Life is one of the best movies that I've seen in a very, very, very long time, it's spectacular, marvelous, fabulous, and unforgettable. I expected De Niro to be good in this movie, as I absolutely adore the man, but I didn't like the movie just because he was in it, I liked it for a lot of other reason as well, such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Blechman. If you haven't seen this movie, then you've got to see it, because there is an extremely high chance that you will love it. You will laugh, you will cry, you will cheer, you will be thrilled with what you will watch. This Boy's Life is a movie that will last, it will never grow old, it will remain a great movie until the end of time, it is not only one of the best I've seen, but it is also one of the best of both Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. So if you haven't seen this movie yet, then watch it, because the chances are you will really, really, really enjoy it. 10/10

    I read the book so many times. Even knew there was a movie about it I had read and re read the book. I loved Tobias Wolff's writing. I think a major reason I didn't like it was because the book had so much to offer. It felt as though there wasn't enough depth in the movie. The movie was good no doubt. I am not a fan of Leonardo Di caprio. However, he did do a good job in this movie. I could think of no one better who could play the role of father as well as Robert De Niro did... Overall it was good and I wouldn't mind watching it again. Though I would prefer reading it again a lot more. Which is a lot for me to say because I do prefer movies a lot more than books. (sorry)

    A single mother and her difficult son find family life isn't necessarily all it's cracked up to be in this film.This Boy's Life is a film adaptation of the memoir of the same name by Tobias Wolff. It is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and it features Leonardo DiCaprio as Tobias Wolff together with Robert De Niro and Ellen Barkin. The film also co-stars Chris Cooper,Carla Gugino,Eliza Dushku and Tobey Maguire in a small role. Nomadic, flaky Caroline just wants to settle down in one place, find a decent guy, and provide a better home for her handful of a son, Toby. When she moves to Seattle and meets the respectful, respectable Dwight Hansen, she thinks she's got it made. Toby, however, feels differently after spending a few months with Dwight and his children and away from Caroline. The boy's stepfather-to-be seems to want to mold Toby into a better person, but to do so he emotionally, verbally, and physically abuses the kid. The marriage proceeds, and soon Caroline, too, recognizes Dwight's need to dominate everyone around him. She sticks with it, though, convinced it's the best thing for her son, and several years of dysfunction ensue. During this time, Tobias befriends another misfit, the possibly homosexual young Arthur Gayle, while continuing to chafe under the yoke of his repressive stepfather.Hoping to leave Concrete and live with his older brother Gregory, Toby decides to apply for east-coast prep-school scholarships. Realizing his grades are not adequate to apply, Toby devises a plan to submit falsified grade reports. Meanwhile, the friendship between Arthur and Toby becomes strained when Arthur confronts Toby regarding his behavior; Arthur tells Toby he is acting more and more like Dwight and asks Toby, "why should you be the one who gets to leave?" Even so, Arthur helps his friend get the papers Toby needs to falsify his grade records and Toby sends in his prep-school applications. When Toby tells Arthur he can leave Concrete and have a better life too, Arthur tells him he will most likely stay. After numerous rejections, Toby is accepted to the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania with a full scholarship.At the end of the film following two years of marriage, Caroline defends Toby during a physically violent argument between her son and husband and they are both seen leaving Dwight and Concrete. This movie provided the first lead role for future superstar Leonardo DiCaprio. He steals the show in this tale of learning how to be a man, with a sly Robert De Niro also giving a good performance.It was a a compelling character study that is well worth watching despite of being too long and a plot that drags.It shows how a resilient teenager survives childhood trauma and adversity through independence, anger and creativity.In short,it is a powerful and compelling stuff that makes it a must-see.

    This Boys Life A Review by Ashley "I SEE YOUR SPOTS LEOPARD!" If I were to explain to you what this movie is actually about it would really put you off. It could make you not even want to see the movie. That being said, this movie is a total gem! It was a boring, hot, sunny afternoon and there was absolutely nothing to watch on television. I was literally flipping through channels when somewhere along the line I decided that a slow paced, uncomfortable, movie about child abuse on Showcase would do. I soon realized that the child being abused was Leonardo DiCaprio and the person doing the abusing was none other than Robert De Niro. This movie is pretty much non- stop action, and by action I mean child abuse. If you hate Robert De Niro this may not be a good movie for you to watch because it will make you hate him even more. This Boy's Life is an incredibly thorough movie; all the main groups of abuse are represented: emotional, physical, psychological and even financial abuses are present throughout. One of the best scenes is when Robert De Niro crams an old mustard jar into Leonardo DiCaprio's eye to teach him a lesson about wasting condiments. This movie has it all, sad drunk driving, awkward gay teens and a bulldog! The sad fact is this movie is actually based on a true story. But, I prefer to forget that and just enjoy the ride.
