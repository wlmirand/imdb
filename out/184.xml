 <sinopse>
  A man is accidentally transported to 1300 A.D., where he must battle an army of the dead and retrieve the Necronomicon so he can return home.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In this sequel to the Evil Dead films, a discount-store employee ("Name's Ash. Housewares.") is time-warped to a medieval castle beset by monstrous forces. Initially mistaken for an enemy, he is soon revealed as the prophecised savior who can quest for the Necronomicon, a book which can dispel the evil. Unfortunately, he screws up the magic words while collecting the tome, and releases an army of skeletons, led by his own Deadite counterpart. What follows is a thrilling, yet tongue-in-cheek battle between Ash's 20th Century tactics and the minions of darkness.

    Army of Darkness continues right from get go of Evil Dead II (which was hinted earlier in that movie) Showing our hero Ash hurdled into the dark ages; battling demons and beasts head on- promising a truly unique piece to a horror comedy trilogy. But that's not exactly what we get. While it's still unique it fails to live up to the evil dead name.And the main reason is: 1)The writers/director ran out of ideas. And forced to say" Screw it!" and changed the whole direction of the trilogy. 2)it's extremely low in quality. The story and film itself completely takes the high road, making Ash a completely different character with a macho personality and cheesy one liners in his place- He is the savior who doesn't give a ****. And that's funny and interesting but where the movie falls apart is how the movie stops any attempt at being scary or original in any sense and puts jokes and slapstick in it's place. And leaves you with a result of the three stooges mixed with Monty Python's Holy Grail. Which is a let down compared to the other 2. As for quality: I'm talking chopped scenes, with slowed and speed up frames, bad stop motion, walmart costumes and green screens.Which is very messed up because it's budget is more than 4X(13 mil) more than it's previous(3 mil) but looks half the amount. I honestly don't know how this movie was rated R because there is zero amount of gore or scary in this film. What there is to like about this film is that it's very quotable and memorable andvery self aware of it's flaws-making it relevant in a cult film sense and becomes a so bad it's great schlock fest. Army of Darkness is at times a hilarious yet disappointing part of a Trilogy.

    Army of Darkness is a nice chance of pace to The Evil Dead franchise and Ash is hilarious as ever here. This film contains so many excellent one liners even though they can be very cheesy and silly sometimes. I'm amazed by how the director makes it so visually interesting by creating some really bizarre and unique sequences. This third chapter was a great piece of entertainment, but I must admit I missed the frights and the gore from the previous films here and I thought the villain (captain of the deadites) was quite lame, not being menacing at all. Nevertheless, Bruce Campbell's character more than makes up for the other forgettable ones since you notice how much fun he's having with his role, making Army of Darkness a very enjoyable experience and a nice fitting end to the trilogy.

    After Ash (Bruce Campbell) was sucked into a vortex and sent back to the medieval age at the end of Evil Dead 2, he now must go on a quest for the Book of the Dead in order to be returned to his own time. In doing so, he accidentally resurrects an army of living skeletons led by his evil undead twin! Lots of carnage and laughs ensue as the shotgun toting, chainsaw armed hero must now battle these monstrous forces with his 20th century tactics and deliver mankind from an ancient evil! This highly entertaining third installment in the awesome Evil Dead series takes a completely different direction than it's two predecessors. Whereas the first two films were strictly horror (though there were many humorous moments in part 2), this film is a straight up action comedy with Three Stooges type gags and filled with slapstick humor. I love how much the protagonist Ash has evolved in the course of three films. In the first movie, he was quite an introverted coward but is now a wisecracking, one liner spitting action hero. He also happens to be my favorite movie character of all time. Bruce Campbell is the man! This is his movie, and he shines throughout every scene he's in. This movie comes highly recommended if you're a fan of hilarious and action packed horror comedies. I know I am!

    When I first watched this, I had no idea it was part of a series. It's been over 10 years since then and I have re-watched this (after watching Evil Dead 1 & 2) and it still very much holds up. As part 2 did, this invents a totally different back-story to support the new direction this is going. While part 2 also hinted on the funnier side of horror, this almost goes completely overboard with it! And it also shows Sam Raimis love for "The Day the Earth stood still" (the original that is, not the awful Keanu Reeves remake). The movie had it tough though and Sam had to shoot a different ending than he intended. I actually like both endings (should be on the disc you're about to buy/rent), but I did watch the commercial/producers request one first. I might tend to like that one more because it seems to come full circle. Whatever your feelings are, this is funny and I can only hope an Army of Darkness 2 entry here on IMDb (even for 2016) proves to be legit (we've been waiting for so long now)!

    Cant say that this is the greatest comedy but I was NOT disappointed. Clearly it is not a horror movie and it has nothing to do with the first installment. I was really impressed with Evil Dead and highly disappointed with Evil Dead II - mostly because I was expecting another horror movie and the jokes were not that funny to me. Being said that, I knew what to expect from Army of Darkness, Only here everything was so much better. Summing up it is not the greatest film but unique in its own way, and I am really looking forward watching Army of Darkness II in 2016, of course if the rumor is true.

    It's not good as "Evil Dead 2" but it's still a fun humorous wacky movie with a bit of horror(well when it comes to the surroundings anyways). This doesn't really have that scare factor compared to the first two, but instead it brings out the crazy, humorous and wacky elements way more this time around. And it takes place in the Medieval Ages I think. Even though this one doesn't really have much to do with the previous installments it's still has that flare going for it. sure it's one of those movies that is the epitome of just going with the flow. Because a lot of it is random or doesn't make much sense. But if you can just go with it, you can enjoy this. What really drives this movie though is Bruce Campbell reprising his role as Ash. His goofy, silly and wackiness while also being a badass brings a lot to this movie. And gives a incentive to root for his side. Although it can be cheesy at times it's still a very fast-paced and entertaining film. Overall it's a ridiculous movie that is so good. 7.9/10

    That's what I thought when I first saw the movie . I wonder why didn't they call it "Evil Dead 3" ? After all it's part of that story . Oh well. The movie is definitely not for everyone . It moves fast , real fast . The characters are barely written . And of course the wild sense of humor won't please everybody . You have to admire Raimi's imagination. The whole movie feels like a crazy mix of cartoon + horror + grindhouse movies. Bruce Campbell rocks as Ash in his macho performance . I can't imagine any other actor playing this part. Yes , sometimes he overacts , but the whole movie has that hiper-active feel to it. The music by Joseph LoDuca is great and the special effects after all these years still look quite good . Compare to two previous movies this one is rather light in terms of violence . Some people might be disappointed with it. Anyway , I had fun . My favourite scene is in the mill. I give it 6/10. Mark Twain would be proud. Watch out for Sam Raimi in a small role of knight.

    This movie is great. It's quotable, and funny as hell. Also, if you don't like horror movies, it's not a problem. If you have gotten the wrong idea from the tone of other films in this franchise, it doesn't effect how much you should watch this one. The first Evil Dead and the remake are outrageously violent (still awesome!) but this one is an all out comedy! This movie should be PG, but this isn't about the tone. Its about the quality. And this movie has it. It's awesome. Its hilarious. Its bad ass. You cant go into this movie expecting a great story and developed characters (though Ash is incredible), thats not what evil dead films are about. They're supposed to be fun, and that is exactly what they are! This movie is (in my opinion only) the best of the Evil Dead films. I rented this movie and watched it three times in one day! It's so fun. Just watch it! Go! Just find it and watch the hell out of it! Great movie! This movie is my BOOMSTICK Nuff said.

    Army of Darkness is pulp art. It sacrifices being good using a normal centralized story design and instead it is good by executing unrefined, spattered entertainment from a different realm. Army of Darkness is a crazy comedy, not much of a horror. It's a unique movie with a great niche. Bruce Campbell is perfect as Ash. Campbell's animated acting throughout the film is consistently approving as it never gets stale. Embeth Davidtz is so lovely and such a great actress. Embeth emits a true capturing characterization of the good and evil Sheila. Sam Raimi does an excellent job with the Evil Dead series. Raimi's true abilities are brought to life within Evil Dead's type of genre. I've never seen The Evil Dead or Evil Dead II but a little, but I understand Army of Darkness to be distinctly different from its prequels primarily for its comedy and as such Army of Darkness is the best of the 3.

    I seem to be on an endless search for a great horror movie. It is almost inevitable that a horror on IMDb scores between 3 and 6 out of 10, yet here we are with an old classic at 7.6. Anything that gets a 7 on IMDb is usually worth a watch for the unprejudiced! How disappointed was I... It's not a real horror, of course, it is a comedy with horror aspects. I really only raised a smile once or twice during viewing, which destroys the comedy aspect. The acting wasn't great, there wasn't much of a story and the effects on 1992 don't translate particularly well. It's probably harsh to judge a movie 20 years on. After all, some real horror classics which rate even higher than this from even earlier are un-watchably poor. All of that aside, this just isn't a great film. It's a silly film with no great story, acting, emotion, anything. Its just something to watch for an hour and a half. It never deserves above a 7 and fits perfectly with the rest of the genuine horror movies at about a 5 or 6.

What there is to like about this film is that it's very quotable and memorable andvery self aware of it's flaws-making it relevant in a cult film sense and becomes a so bad it's great schlock fest. Army of Darkness is at times a hilarious yet disappointing part of a Trilogy.

    Army of Darkness is a nice chance of pace to The Evil Dead franchise and Ash is hilarious as ever here. This film contains so many excellent one liners even though they can be very cheesy and silly sometimes. I'm amazed by how the director makes it so visually interesting by creating some really bizarre and unique sequences. This third chapter was a great piece of entertainment, but I must admit I missed the frights and the gore from the previous films here and I thought the villain (captain of the deadites) was quite lame, not being menacing at all. Nevertheless, Bruce Campbell's character more than makes up for the other forgettable ones since you notice how much fun he's having with his role, making Army of Darkness a very enjoyable experience and a nice fitting end to the trilogy.

    After Ash (Bruce Campbell) was sucked into a vortex and sent back to the medieval age at the end of Evil Dead 2, he now must go on a quest for the Book of the Dead in order to be returned to his own time. In doing so, he accidentally resurrects an army of living skeletons led by his evil undead twin! Lots of carnage and laughs ensue as the shotgun toting, chainsaw armed hero must now battle these monstrous forces with his 20th century tactics and deliver mankind from an ancient evil! This highly entertaining third installment in the awesome Evil Dead series takes a completely different direction than it's two predecessors. Whereas the first two films were strictly horror (though there were many humorous moments in part 2), this film is a straight up action comedy with Three Stooges type gags and filled with slapstick humor. I love how much the protagonist Ash has evolved in the course of three films. In the first movie, he was quite an introverted coward but is now a wisecracking, one liner spitting action hero. He also happens to be my favorite movie character of all time. Bruce Campbell is the man! This is his movie, and he shines throughout every scene he's in. This movie comes highly recommended if you're a fan of hilarious and action packed horror comedies. I know I am!

    When I first watched this, I had no idea it was part of a series. It's been over 10 years since then and I have re-watched this (after watching Evil Dead 1 & 2) and it still very much holds up. As part 2 did, this invents a totally different back-story to support the new direction this is going. While part 2 also hinted on the funnier side of horror, this almost goes completely overboard with it! And it also shows Sam Raimis love for "The Day the Earth stood still" (the original that is, not the awful Keanu Reeves remake). The movie had it tough though and Sam had to shoot a different ending than he intended. I actually like both endings (should be on the disc you're about to buy/rent), but I did watch the commercial/producers request one first. I might tend to like that one more because it seems to come full circle. Whatever your feelings are, this is funny and I can only hope an Army of Darkness 2 entry here on IMDb (even for 2016) proves to be legit (we've been waiting for so long now)!

    Cant say that this is the greatest comedy but I was NOT disappointed. Clearly it is not a horror movie and it has nothing to do with the first installment. I was really impressed with Evil Dead and highly disappointed with Evil Dead II - mostly because I was expecting another horror movie and the jokes were not that funny to me. Being said that, I knew what to expect from Army of Darkness, Only here everything was so much better. Summing up it is not the greatest film but unique in its own way, and I am really looking forward watching Army of Darkness II in 2016, of course if the rumor is true.

    It's not good as "Evil Dead 2" but it's still a fun humorous wacky movie with a bit of horror(well when it comes to the surroundings anyways). This doesn't really have that scare factor compared to the first two, but instead it brings out the crazy, humorous and wacky elements way more this time around. And it takes place in the Medieval Ages I think. Even though this one doesn't really have much to do with the previous installments it's still has that flare going for it. sure it's one of those movies that is the epitome of just going with the flow. Because a lot of it is random or doesn't make much sense. But if you can just go with it, you can enjoy this. What really drives this movie though is Bruce Campbell reprising his role as Ash. His goofy, silly and wackiness while also being a badass brings a lot to this movie. And gives a incentive to root for his side. Although it can be cheesy at times it's still a very fast-paced and entertaining film. Overall it's a ridiculous movie that is so good. 7.9/10

    That's what I thought when I first saw the movie . I wonder why didn't they call it "Evil Dead 3" ? After all it's part of that story . Oh well. The movie is definitely not for everyone . It moves fast , real fast . The characters are barely written . And of course the wild sense of humor won't please everybody . You have to admire Raimi's imagination. The whole movie feels like a crazy mix of cartoon + horror + grindhouse movies. Bruce Campbell rocks as Ash in his macho performance . I can't imagine any other actor playing this part. Yes , sometimes he overacts , but the whole movie has that hiper-active feel to it. The music by Joseph LoDuca is great and the special effects after all these years still look quite good . Compare to two previous movies this one is rather light in terms of violence . Some people might be disappointed with it. Anyway , I had fun . My favourite scene is in the mill. I give it 6/10. Mark Twain would be proud. Watch out for Sam Raimi in a small role of knight.

    This movie is great. It's quotable, and funny as hell. Also, if you don't like horror movies, it's not a problem. If you have gotten the wrong idea from the tone of other films in this franchise, it doesn't effect how much you should watch this one. The first Evil Dead and the remake are outrageously violent (still awesome!) but this one is an all out comedy! This movie should be PG, but this isn't about the tone. Its about the quality. And this movie has it. It's awesome. Its hilarious. Its bad ass. You cant go into this movie expecting a great story and developed characters (though Ash is incredible), thats not what evil dead films are about. They're supposed to be fun, and that is exactly what they are! This movie is (in my opinion only) the best of the Evil Dead films. I rented this movie and watched it three times in one day! It's so fun. Just watch it! Go! Just find it and watch the hell out of it! Great movie! This movie is my BOOMSTICK Nuff said.

    Army of Darkness is pulp art. It sacrifices being good using a normal centralized story design and instead it is good by executing unrefined, spattered entertainment from a different realm. Army of Darkness is a crazy comedy, not much of a horror. It's a unique movie with a great niche. Bruce Campbell is perfect as Ash. Campbell's animated acting throughout the film is consistently approving as it never gets stale. Embeth Davidtz is so lovely and such a great actress. Embeth emits a true capturing characterization of the good and evil Sheila. Sam Raimi does an excellent job with the Evil Dead series. Raimi's true abilities are brought to life within Evil Dead's type of genre. I've never seen The Evil Dead or Evil Dead II but a little, but I understand Army of Darkness to be distinctly different from its prequels primarily for its comedy and as such Army of Darkness is the best of the 3.

    I seem to be on an endless search for a great horror movie. It is almost inevitable that a horror on IMDb scores between 3 and 6 out of 10, yet here we are with an old classic at 7.6. Anything that gets a 7 on IMDb is usually worth a watch for the unprejudiced! How disappointed was I... It's not a real horror, of course, it is a comedy with horror aspects. I really only raised a smile once or twice during viewing, which destroys the comedy aspect. The acting wasn't great, there wasn't much of a story and the effects on 1992 don't translate particularly well. It's probably harsh to judge a movie 20 years on. After all, some real horror classics which rate even higher than this from even earlier are un-watchably poor. All of that aside, this just isn't a great film. It's a silly film with no great story, acting, emotion, anything. Its just something to watch for an hour and a half. It never deserves above a 7 and fits perfectly with the rest of the genuine horror movies at about a 5 or 6.

    Army of Darkness continues right from get go of Evil Dead II (which was hinted earlier in that movie) Showing our hero Ash hurdled into the dark ages; battling demons and beasts head on- promising a truly unique piece to a horror comedy trilogy. But that's not exactly what we get. While it's still unique it fails to live up to the evil dead name.And the main reason is: 1)The writers/director ran out of ideas. And forced to say" Screw it!" and changed the whole direction of the trilogy. 2)it's extremely low in quality. The story and film itself completely takes the high road, making Ash a completely different character with a macho personality and cheesy one liners in his place- He is the savior who doesn't give a ****. And that's funny and interesting but where the movie falls apart is how the movie stops any attempt at being scary or original in any sense and puts jokes and slapstick in it's place. And leaves you with a result of the three stooges mixed with Monty Python's Holy Grail. Which is a let down compared to the other 2. As for quality: I'm talking chopped scenes, with slowed and speed up frames, bad stop motion, walmart costumes and green screens.Which is very messed up because it's budget is more than 4X(13 mil) more than it's previous(3 mil) but looks half the amount.

And it also shows Sam Raimis love for "The Day the Earth stood still" (the original that is, not the awful Keanu Reeves remake). The movie had it tough though and Sam had to shoot a different ending than he intended. I actually like both endings (should be on the disc you're about to buy/rent), but I did watch the commercial/producers request one first. I might tend to like that one more because it seems to come full circle. Whatever your feelings are, this is funny and I can only hope an Army of Darkness 2 entry here on IMDb (even for 2016) proves to be legit (we've been waiting for so long now)!

    Cant say that this is the greatest comedy but I was NOT disappointed. Clearly it is not a horror movie and it has nothing to do with the first installment. I was really impressed with Evil Dead and highly disappointed with Evil Dead II - mostly because I was expecting another horror movie and the jokes were not that funny to me. Being said that, I knew what to expect from Army of Darkness, Only here everything was so much better. Summing up it is not the greatest film but unique in its own way, and I am really looking forward watching Army of Darkness II in 2016, of course if the rumor is true.

    It's not good as "Evil Dead 2" but it's still a fun humorous wacky movie with a bit of horror(well when it comes to the surroundings anyways). This doesn't really have that scare factor compared to the first two, but instead it brings out the crazy, humorous and wacky elements way more this time around. And it takes place in the Medieval Ages I think. Even though this one doesn't really have much to do with the previous installments it's still has that flare going for it. sure it's one of those movies that is the epitome of just going with the flow. Because a lot of it is random or doesn't make much sense. But if you can just go with it, you can enjoy this. What really drives this movie though is Bruce Campbell reprising his role as Ash. His goofy, silly and wackiness while also being a badass brings a lot to this movie. And gives a incentive to root for his side. Although it can be cheesy at times it's still a very fast-paced and entertaining film. Overall it's a ridiculous movie that is so good. 7.9/10

    That's what I thought when I first saw the movie . I wonder why didn't they call it "Evil Dead 3" ? After all it's part of that story . Oh well. The movie is definitely not for everyone . It moves fast , real fast . The characters are barely written . And of course the wild sense of humor won't please everybody . You have to admire Raimi's imagination. The whole movie feels like a crazy mix of cartoon + horror + grindhouse movies. Bruce Campbell rocks as Ash in his macho performance . I can't imagine any other actor playing this part. Yes , sometimes he overacts , but the whole movie has that hiper-active feel to it. The music by Joseph LoDuca is great and the special effects after all these years still look quite good . Compare to two previous movies this one is rather light in terms of violence . Some people might be disappointed with it. Anyway , I had fun . My favourite scene is in the mill. I give it 6/10. Mark Twain would be proud. Watch out for Sam Raimi in a small role of knight.

    This movie is great. It's quotable, and funny as hell. Also, if you don't like horror movies, it's not a problem. If you have gotten the wrong idea from the tone of other films in this franchise, it doesn't effect how much you should watch this one. The first Evil Dead and the remake are outrageously violent (still awesome!) but this one is an all out comedy! This movie should be PG, but this isn't about the tone. Its about the quality. And this movie has it. It's awesome. Its hilarious. Its bad ass. You cant go into this movie expecting a great story and developed characters (though Ash is incredible), thats not what evil dead films are about. They're supposed to be fun, and that is exactly what they are! This movie is (in my opinion only) the best of the Evil Dead films. I rented this movie and watched it three times in one day! It's so fun. Just watch it! Go! Just find it and watch the hell out of it! Great movie! This movie is my BOOMSTICK Nuff said.

    Army of Darkness is pulp art. It sacrifices being good using a normal centralized story design and instead it is good by executing unrefined, spattered entertainment from a different realm. Army of Darkness is a crazy comedy, not much of a horror. It's a unique movie with a great niche. Bruce Campbell is perfect as Ash. Campbell's animated acting throughout the film is consistently approving as it never gets stale. Embeth Davidtz is so lovely and such a great actress. Embeth emits a true capturing characterization of the good and evil Sheila. Sam Raimi does an excellent job with the Evil Dead series. Raimi's true abilities are brought to life within Evil Dead's type of genre. I've never seen The Evil Dead or Evil Dead II but a little, but I understand Army of Darkness to be distinctly different from its prequels primarily for its comedy and as such Army of Darkness is the best of the 3.

    I seem to be on an endless search for a great horror movie. It is almost inevitable that a horror on IMDb scores between 3 and 6 out of 10, yet here we are with an old classic at 7.6. Anything that gets a 7 on IMDb is usually worth a watch for the unprejudiced! How disappointed was I... It's not a real horror, of course, it is a comedy with horror aspects. I really only raised a smile once or twice during viewing, which destroys the comedy aspect. The acting wasn't great, there wasn't much of a story and the effects on 1992 don't translate particularly well. It's probably harsh to judge a movie 20 years on. After all, some real horror classics which rate even higher than this from even earlier are un-watchably poor. All of that aside, this just isn't a great film. It's a silly film with no great story, acting, emotion, anything. Its just something to watch for an hour and a half. It never deserves above a 7 and fits perfectly with the rest of the genuine horror movies at about a 5 or 6.

    Army of Darkness continues right from get go of Evil Dead II (which was hinted earlier in that movie) Showing our hero Ash hurdled into the dark ages; battling demons and beasts head on- promising a truly unique piece to a horror comedy trilogy. But that's not exactly what we get. While it's still unique it fails to live up to the evil dead name.And the main reason is: 1)The writers/director ran out of ideas. And forced to say" Screw it!" and changed the whole direction of the trilogy. 2)it's extremely low in quality. The story and film itself completely takes the high road, making Ash a completely different character with a macho personality and cheesy one liners in his place- He is the savior who doesn't give a ****. And that's funny and interesting but where the movie falls apart is how the movie stops any attempt at being scary or original in any sense and puts jokes and slapstick in it's place. And leaves you with a result of the three stooges mixed with Monty Python's Holy Grail. Which is a let down compared to the other 2. As for quality: I'm talking chopped scenes, with slowed and speed up frames, bad stop motion, walmart costumes and green screens.Which is very messed up because it's budget is more than 4X(13 mil) more than it's previous(3 mil) but looks half the amount. I honestly don't know how this movie was rated R because there is zero amount of gore or scary in this film. What there is to like about this film is that it's very quotable and memorable andvery self aware of it's flaws-making it relevant in a cult film sense and becomes a so bad it's great schlock fest. Army of Darkness is at times a hilarious yet disappointing part of a Trilogy.

    Army of Darkness is a nice chance of pace to The Evil Dead franchise and Ash is hilarious as ever here. This film contains so many excellent one liners even though they can be very cheesy and silly sometimes. I'm amazed by how the director makes it so visually interesting by creating some really bizarre and unique sequences. This third chapter was a great piece of entertainment, but I must admit I missed the frights and the gore from the previous films here and I thought the villain (captain of the deadites) was quite lame, not being menacing at all. Nevertheless, Bruce Campbell's character more than makes up for the other forgettable ones since you notice how much fun he's having with his role, making Army of Darkness a very enjoyable experience and a nice fitting end to the trilogy.

    After Ash (Bruce Campbell) was sucked into a vortex and sent back to the medieval age at the end of Evil Dead 2, he now must go on a quest for the Book of the Dead in order to be returned to his own time. In doing so, he accidentally resurrects an army of living skeletons led by his evil undead twin! Lots of carnage and laughs ensue as the shotgun toting, chainsaw armed hero must now battle these monstrous forces with his 20th century tactics and deliver mankind from an ancient evil! This highly entertaining third installment in the awesome Evil Dead series takes a completely different direction than it's two predecessors. Whereas the first two films were strictly horror (though there were many humorous moments in part 2), this film is a straight up action comedy with Three Stooges type gags and filled with slapstick humor. I love how much the protagonist Ash has evolved in the course of three films. In the first movie, he was quite an introverted coward but is now a wisecracking, one liner spitting action hero. He also happens to be my favorite movie character of all time. Bruce Campbell is the man! This is his movie, and he shines throughout every scene he's in. This movie comes highly recommended if you're a fan of hilarious and action packed horror comedies. I know I am!

Yes , sometimes he overacts , but the whole movie has that hiper-active feel to it. The music by Joseph LoDuca is great and the special effects after all these years still look quite good . Compare to two previous movies this one is rather light in terms of violence . Some people might be disappointed with it. Anyway , I had fun . My favourite scene is in the mill. I give it 6/10. Mark Twain would be proud. Watch out for Sam Raimi in a small role of knight.

    This movie is great. It's quotable, and funny as hell. Also, if you don't like horror movies, it's not a problem. If you have gotten the wrong idea from the tone of other films in this franchise, it doesn't effect how much you should watch this one. The first Evil Dead and the remake are outrageously violent (still awesome!) but this one is an all out comedy! This movie should be PG, but this isn't about the tone. Its about the quality. And this movie has it. It's awesome. Its hilarious. Its bad ass. You cant go into this movie expecting a great story and developed characters (though Ash is incredible), thats not what evil dead films are about. They're supposed to be fun, and that is exactly what they are! This movie is (in my opinion only) the best of the Evil Dead films. I rented this movie and watched it three times in one day! It's so fun. Just watch it! Go! Just find it and watch the hell out of it! Great movie! This movie is my BOOMSTICK Nuff said.

    Army of Darkness is pulp art. It sacrifices being good using a normal centralized story design and instead it is good by executing unrefined, spattered entertainment from a different realm. Army of Darkness is a crazy comedy, not much of a horror. It's a unique movie with a great niche. Bruce Campbell is perfect as Ash. Campbell's animated acting throughout the film is consistently approving as it never gets stale. Embeth Davidtz is so lovely and such a great actress. Embeth emits a true capturing characterization of the good and evil Sheila. Sam Raimi does an excellent job with the Evil Dead series. Raimi's true abilities are brought to life within Evil Dead's type of genre. I've never seen The Evil Dead or Evil Dead II but a little, but I understand Army of Darkness to be distinctly different from its prequels primarily for its comedy and as such Army of Darkness is the best of the 3.

    I seem to be on an endless search for a great horror movie. It is almost inevitable that a horror on IMDb scores between 3 and 6 out of 10, yet here we are with an old classic at 7.6. Anything that gets a 7 on IMDb is usually worth a watch for the unprejudiced! How disappointed was I... It's not a real horror, of course, it is a comedy with horror aspects. I really only raised a smile once or twice during viewing, which destroys the comedy aspect. The acting wasn't great, there wasn't much of a story and the effects on 1992 don't translate particularly well. It's probably harsh to judge a movie 20 years on. After all, some real horror classics which rate even higher than this from even earlier are un-watchably poor. All of that aside, this just isn't a great film. It's a silly film with no great story, acting, emotion, anything. Its just something to watch for an hour and a half. It never deserves above a 7 and fits perfectly with the rest of the genuine horror movies at about a 5 or 6.

    Army of Darkness continues right from get go of Evil Dead II (which was hinted earlier in that movie) Showing our hero Ash hurdled into the dark ages; battling demons and beasts head on- promising a truly unique piece to a horror comedy trilogy. But that's not exactly what we get. While it's still unique it fails to live up to the evil dead name.And the main reason is: 1)The writers/director ran out of ideas. And forced to say" Screw it!" and changed the whole direction of the trilogy. 2)it's extremely low in quality. The story and film itself completely takes the high road, making Ash a completely different character with a macho personality and cheesy one liners in his place- He is the savior who doesn't give a ****. And that's funny and interesting but where the movie falls apart is how the movie stops any attempt at being scary or original in any sense and puts jokes and slapstick in it's place. And leaves you with a result of the three stooges mixed with Monty Python's Holy Grail. Which is a let down compared to the other 2. As for quality: I'm talking chopped scenes, with slowed and speed up frames, bad stop motion, walmart costumes and green screens.Which is very messed up because it's budget is more than 4X(13 mil) more than it's previous(3 mil) but looks half the amount. I honestly don't know how this movie was rated R because there is zero amount of gore or scary in this film. What there is to like about this film is that it's very quotable and memorable andvery self aware of it's flaws-making it relevant in a cult film sense and becomes a so bad it's great schlock fest. Army of Darkness is at times a hilarious yet disappointing part of a Trilogy.

    Army of Darkness is a nice chance of pace to The Evil Dead franchise and Ash is hilarious as ever here. This film contains so many excellent one liners even though they can be very cheesy and silly sometimes. I'm amazed by how the director makes it so visually interesting by creating some really bizarre and unique sequences. This third chapter was a great piece of entertainment, but I must admit I missed the frights and the gore from the previous films here and I thought the villain (captain of the deadites) was quite lame, not being menacing at all. Nevertheless, Bruce Campbell's character more than makes up for the other forgettable ones since you notice how much fun he's having with his role, making Army of Darkness a very enjoyable experience and a nice fitting end to the trilogy.

    After Ash (Bruce Campbell) was sucked into a vortex and sent back to the medieval age at the end of Evil Dead 2, he now must go on a quest for the Book of the Dead in order to be returned to his own time. In doing so, he accidentally resurrects an army of living skeletons led by his evil undead twin! Lots of carnage and laughs ensue as the shotgun toting, chainsaw armed hero must now battle these monstrous forces with his 20th century tactics and deliver mankind from an ancient evil! This highly entertaining third installment in the awesome Evil Dead series takes a completely different direction than it's two predecessors. Whereas the first two films were strictly horror (though there were many humorous moments in part 2), this film is a straight up action comedy with Three Stooges type gags and filled with slapstick humor. I love how much the protagonist Ash has evolved in the course of three films. In the first movie, he was quite an introverted coward but is now a wisecracking, one liner spitting action hero. He also happens to be my favorite movie character of all time. Bruce Campbell is the man! This is his movie, and he shines throughout every scene he's in. This movie comes highly recommended if you're a fan of hilarious and action packed horror comedies. I know I am!

    When I first watched this, I had no idea it was part of a series. It's been over 10 years since then and I have re-watched this (after watching Evil Dead 1 & 2) and it still very much holds up. As part 2 did, this invents a totally different back-story to support the new direction this is going. While part 2 also hinted on the funnier side of horror, this almost goes completely overboard with it! And it also shows Sam Raimis love for "The Day the Earth stood still" (the original that is, not the awful Keanu Reeves remake). The movie had it tough though and Sam had to shoot a different ending than he intended. I actually like both endings (should be on the disc you're about to buy/rent), but I did watch the commercial/producers request one first. I might tend to like that one more because it seems to come full circle. Whatever your feelings are, this is funny and I can only hope an Army of Darkness 2 entry here on IMDb (even for 2016) proves to be legit (we've been waiting for so long now)!

    Cant say that this is the greatest comedy but I was NOT disappointed. Clearly it is not a horror movie and it has nothing to do with the first installment. I was really impressed with Evil Dead and highly disappointed with Evil Dead II - mostly because I was expecting another horror movie and the jokes were not that funny to me. Being said that, I knew what to expect from Army of Darkness, Only here everything was so much better. Summing up it is not the greatest film but unique in its own way, and I am really looking forward watching Army of Darkness II in 2016, of course if the rumor is true.

    It's not good as "Evil Dead 2" but it's still a fun humorous wacky movie with a bit of horror(well when it comes to the surroundings anyways). This doesn't really have that scare factor compared to the first two, but instead it brings out the crazy, humorous and wacky elements way more this time around. And it takes place in the Medieval Ages I think. Even though this one doesn't really have much to do with the previous installments it's still has that flare going for it. sure it's one of those movies that is the epitome of just going with the flow. Because a lot of it is random or doesn't make much sense. But if you can just go with it, you can enjoy this. What really drives this movie though is Bruce Campbell reprising his role as Ash. His goofy, silly and wackiness while also being a badass brings a lot to this movie. And gives a incentive to root for his side. Although it can be cheesy at times it's still a very fast-paced and entertaining film. Overall it's a ridiculous movie that is so good. 7.9/10

I really only raised a smile once or twice during viewing, which destroys the comedy aspect. The acting wasn't great, there wasn't much of a story and the effects on 1992 don't translate particularly well. It's probably harsh to judge a movie 20 years on. After all, some real horror classics which rate even higher than this from even earlier are un-watchably poor. All of that aside, this just isn't a great film. It's a silly film with no great story, acting, emotion, anything. Its just something to watch for an hour and a half. It never deserves above a 7 and fits perfectly with the rest of the genuine horror movies at about a 5 or 6.

    Army of Darkness continues right from get go of Evil Dead II (which was hinted earlier in that movie) Showing our hero Ash hurdled into the dark ages; battling demons and beasts head on- promising a truly unique piece to a horror comedy trilogy. But that's not exactly what we get. While it's still unique it fails to live up to the evil dead name.And the main reason is: 1)The writers/director ran out of ideas. And forced to say" Screw it!" and changed the whole direction of the trilogy. 2)it's extremely low in quality. The story and film itself completely takes the high road, making Ash a completely different character with a macho personality and cheesy one liners in his place- He is the savior who doesn't give a ****. And that's funny and interesting but where the movie falls apart is how the movie stops any attempt at being scary or original in any sense and puts jokes and slapstick in it's place. And leaves you with a result of the three stooges mixed with Monty Python's Holy Grail. Which is a let down compared to the other 2. As for quality: I'm talking chopped scenes, with slowed and speed up frames, bad stop motion, walmart costumes and green screens.Which is very messed up because it's budget is more than 4X(13 mil) more than it's previous(3 mil) but looks half the amount. I honestly don't know how this movie was rated R because there is zero amount of gore or scary in this film. What there is to like about this film is that it's very quotable and memorable andvery self aware of it's flaws-making it relevant in a cult film sense and becomes a so bad it's great schlock fest. Army of Darkness is at times a hilarious yet disappointing part of a Trilogy.

    Army of Darkness is a nice chance of pace to The Evil Dead franchise and Ash is hilarious as ever here. This film contains so many excellent one liners even though they can be very cheesy and silly sometimes. I'm amazed by how the director makes it so visually interesting by creating some really bizarre and unique sequences. This third chapter was a great piece of entertainment, but I must admit I missed the frights and the gore from the previous films here and I thought the villain (captain of the deadites) was quite lame, not being menacing at all. Nevertheless, Bruce Campbell's character more than makes up for the other forgettable ones since you notice how much fun he's having with his role, making Army of Darkness a very enjoyable experience and a nice fitting end to the trilogy.

    After Ash (Bruce Campbell) was sucked into a vortex and sent back to the medieval age at the end of Evil Dead 2, he now must go on a quest for the Book of the Dead in order to be returned to his own time. In doing so, he accidentally resurrects an army of living skeletons led by his evil undead twin! Lots of carnage and laughs ensue as the shotgun toting, chainsaw armed hero must now battle these monstrous forces with his 20th century tactics and deliver mankind from an ancient evil! This highly entertaining third installment in the awesome Evil Dead series takes a completely different direction than it's two predecessors. Whereas the first two films were strictly horror (though there were many humorous moments in part 2), this film is a straight up action comedy with Three Stooges type gags and filled with slapstick humor. I love how much the protagonist Ash has evolved in the course of three films. In the first movie, he was quite an introverted coward but is now a wisecracking, one liner spitting action hero. He also happens to be my favorite movie character of all time. Bruce Campbell is the man! This is his movie, and he shines throughout every scene he's in. This movie comes highly recommended if you're a fan of hilarious and action packed horror comedies. I know I am!

    When I first watched this, I had no idea it was part of a series. It's been over 10 years since then and I have re-watched this (after watching Evil Dead 1 & 2) and it still very much holds up. As part 2 did, this invents a totally different back-story to support the new direction this is going. While part 2 also hinted on the funnier side of horror, this almost goes completely overboard with it! And it also shows Sam Raimis love for "The Day the Earth stood still" (the original that is, not the awful Keanu Reeves remake). The movie had it tough though and Sam had to shoot a different ending than he intended. I actually like both endings (should be on the disc you're about to buy/rent), but I did watch the commercial/producers request one first. I might tend to like that one more because it seems to come full circle. Whatever your feelings are, this is funny and I can only hope an Army of Darkness 2 entry here on IMDb (even for 2016) proves to be legit (we've been waiting for so long now)!

    Cant say that this is the greatest comedy but I was NOT disappointed. Clearly it is not a horror movie and it has nothing to do with the first installment. I was really impressed with Evil Dead and highly disappointed with Evil Dead II - mostly because I was expecting another horror movie and the jokes were not that funny to me. Being said that, I knew what to expect from Army of Darkness, Only here everything was so much better. Summing up it is not the greatest film but unique in its own way, and I am really looking forward watching Army of Darkness II in 2016, of course if the rumor is true.

    It's not good as "Evil Dead 2" but it's still a fun humorous wacky movie with a bit of horror(well when it comes to the surroundings anyways). This doesn't really have that scare factor compared to the first two, but instead it brings out the crazy, humorous and wacky elements way more this time around. And it takes place in the Medieval Ages I think. Even though this one doesn't really have much to do with the previous installments it's still has that flare going for it. sure it's one of those movies that is the epitome of just going with the flow. Because a lot of it is random or doesn't make much sense. But if you can just go with it, you can enjoy this. What really drives this movie though is Bruce Campbell reprising his role as Ash. His goofy, silly and wackiness while also being a badass brings a lot to this movie. And gives a incentive to root for his side. Although it can be cheesy at times it's still a very fast-paced and entertaining film. Overall it's a ridiculous movie that is so good. 7.9/10

    That's what I thought when I first saw the movie . I wonder why didn't they call it "Evil Dead 3" ? After all it's part of that story . Oh well. The movie is definitely not for everyone . It moves fast , real fast . The characters are barely written . And of course the wild sense of humor won't please everybody . You have to admire Raimi's imagination. The whole movie feels like a crazy mix of cartoon + horror + grindhouse movies. Bruce Campbell rocks as Ash in his macho performance . I can't imagine any other actor playing this part. Yes , sometimes he overacts , but the whole movie has that hiper-active feel to it. The music by Joseph LoDuca is great and the special effects after all these years still look quite good . Compare to two previous movies this one is rather light in terms of violence . Some people might be disappointed with it. Anyway , I had fun . My favourite scene is in the mill. I give it 6/10. Mark Twain would be proud. Watch out for Sam Raimi in a small role of knight.

    This movie is great. It's quotable, and funny as hell. Also, if you don't like horror movies, it's not a problem. If you have gotten the wrong idea from the tone of other films in this franchise, it doesn't effect how much you should watch this one. The first Evil Dead and the remake are outrageously violent (still awesome!) but this one is an all out comedy! This movie should be PG, but this isn't about the tone. Its about the quality. And this movie has it. It's awesome. Its hilarious. Its bad ass. You cant go into this movie expecting a great story and developed characters (though Ash is incredible), thats not what evil dead films are about. They're supposed to be fun, and that is exactly what they are! This movie is (in my opinion only) the best of the Evil Dead films. I rented this movie and watched it three times in one day! It's so fun. Just watch it! Go! Just find it and watch the hell out of it! Great movie! This movie is my BOOMSTICK Nuff said.

    Army of Darkness is pulp art. It sacrifices being good using a normal centralized story design and instead it is good by executing unrefined, spattered entertainment from a different realm. Army of Darkness is a crazy comedy, not much of a horror. It's a unique movie with a great niche. Bruce Campbell is perfect as Ash. Campbell's animated acting throughout the film is consistently approving as it never gets stale. Embeth Davidtz is so lovely and such a great actress. Embeth emits a true capturing characterization of the good and evil Sheila. Sam Raimi does an excellent job with the Evil Dead series. Raimi's true abilities are brought to life within Evil Dead's type of genre. I've never seen The Evil Dead or Evil Dead II but a little, but I understand Army of Darkness to be distinctly different from its prequels primarily for its comedy and as such Army of Darkness is the best of the 3.
