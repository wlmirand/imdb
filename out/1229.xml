    Here we have a sequel which has pretty much nothing to do with the first film in the series. Which is probably a good thing as that first film was quite terrible. Unfortunately this one is really no better. Alyssa Milano plays Lily, a shy girl from Michigan who goes to college in Los Angeles. There she comes out of her shell. And out of her clothes. Milano, at the point in her career where she felt the need to show how grown-up she was, dutifully doffs her top a few times. Honestly that's the only reason this movie exists, as a vehicle to put Milano on naked display. And again being honest that's probably the only reason anyone would ever watch this movie. You want a topless Alyssa Milano you got it. You want a decent movie you are well and truly out of luck. Whereas Ivy, the central figure in the first film, was an unapologetic seductress and homewrecker Lily is a good girl at heart. A bit clueless but good nonetheless. Anyhow her pervy art professor tries to take advantage of her. And one of her fellow students treats her badly and publicly humiliates her so she of course immediately sleeps with him. Eventually she tries to tap into her darker, more seductive side but that effort fails rather miserably. Some other weirdos float around on the periphery of the story and eventually it all comes to an end in what may be the worst final fifteen minutes of any movie ever. The movie had very little going for it throughout and in that ending it completely falls apart. It's an ending which piles one laughable absurdity upon another. The movie's supposed to be a thriller but it ends up as an unintentional comedy. Sadly it's not even a good unintentional comedy. The story stinks, the dialogue is pitiful, the acting is generally terrible and the obtrusive music is just painful. This is a movie with nothing to recommend it. If you're just here for Alyssa Milano's breasts enjoy them. You won't enjoy anything else.

    Lily (Alyssa Milano) is a shy Michigan art student who has somehow managed to secure herself a place at an LA college despite her pathetic scribblings resembling that of an average twelve year old. Soon after moving into her student lodgings, Lily discovers a diary that once belonged to Ivy, the disturbed babe played by Drew Barrymore in the first film. Inspired by Ivy's confidence and fearlessness, Lily adopts a new, more seductive persona to help her overcome her reservations and be accepted by her peers. Having briefly held a reputation for being a wild child, hottie Alyssa Milano must have seemed like the obvious choice to follow in Drew Barrymore's footsteps for this sequel to Poison Ivy; but despite Milano happily shedding her clothes to indulge in several steamy soft-core sex scenes, Poison Ivy 2 proves to be less fun than the original movie. Barrymore's Ivy was damaged goods: an unpredictable loose cannon, she exuded a genuine air of sexual danger, and yet this 'bad-girl' was still worthy of our compassion, her damaged psyche clearly the result of a very troubled childhood. In short, she was complex as well as sexy. Poison Ivy 2's Lily has a far less valid excuse for her wanton behaviour: her upbringing apparently trauma-free, Lily is simply desperate to be popular and feels that the best way to achieve this is to act like a total slut. It doesn't make her very endearing (alluring yes, but not exactly likable) or particularly interesting. The male characters in this film are as equally vapid and unagreeable: Lily's sculptor boyfriend Gredin (Johnathon Schaech) is a clingy pretty boy who proves to be as bland as his 'art', while lustful teacher Donald Falk (Xander Berkeley) is not only an adulterous sleaze-bag but every bit as bad an artist as his students. After lots of fairly unexceptional eroticism, during which Milano flashes her tits a lot (yayy!), Poison Ivy 2 moves into predictable thriller mode for the final&eacute;, a frustrated Falk getting his rape on with temptress Lily, only to be caught in the act by Gredin, Falk's wife Angela (Belinda Bauer) and his daughter Daphne (a young Camilla Belle), and then become a knife wielding lunatic destined to die by the closing credits. Poison Ivy 2 is available in both rated and unrated versions on Region 1, but unrated is clearly the way to go, with several minutes more of Alyssa in the buff being a naughty, naughty girl.

    This is a first class stinker of major proportions. A young girl goes off to art school in California, leaving her home in Michigan. Her parents call once to speak to her and despite their so called concern, you never hear from them again. The movie is unbearably slow moving. It essentially comes down to the young lady supposedly asserting herself by getting involved in simultaneous affairs with both her art professor and a fellow student. Our heroine is more like a witch. She is really the embodiment of a possessive misery and that word is most appropriate to describe this dull film with an unhappy ending.

    Poison Ivy II is set in Los Angeles as a teenage student named Lily Leonetti (Alyssa Milano) arrives two weeks late for the start of her life study art class at university having been delayed in Michigan. Shy, retiring & modest Lily is a very pretty girl who attracts the attention of local hunk Gredin (Jonathon Schaech) & her art class teacher Donald (Xander Berkeley). While at home in a university dorm Lily finds a box in her wardrobe, inside the box are some slutty clothes & & diary that belonged to the last resident, a girl named Ivy. Lily is fascinated by the diary & Ivy's thoughts, Lily starts to copy Ivy & think like her as she cuts her hair, gets a piercing & starts to wear very revealing clothes as she tries to decide whether she wants to date Gredin or Donald. Lily settles on Gredin but Donald won't let her go as easily as Lily would like & things turn violent as lives are torn apart... Directed by Anne Goursaud this was the first sequel to the erotic thriller Poison Ivy (1992) whose only claim to fame is that it starred a young Drew Barrymore but otherwise was total crap, I saw the original Poison Ivy only last week & really didn't like it at all so while my expectations for Poison Ivy II weren't high even I was unprepared for just how bad this is. It's interesting to note that the script was written by someone called Chloe King so if we then remember the director was also a woman you could say that the main creative driving forces behind Poison Ivy II are women & it's maybe no surprise that it's the men who turn out to be the biggest scumbags here. In fact Lily does very little wrong here, she certainly doesn't do anything illegal or physically hurt anyone & it's the art teacher who goes all mental & comes across as the real villain of the film. Sure Lilly leads him on a little bit & flirts between the young hunky Gredin & the older married Donald but otherwise does nothing even remotely evil or dangerous or nasty. I thought the whole point of a Poison Ivy film was that it was the woman who was the seductive evildoer who used her looks & manipulative charm to get what she wanted & ruin lives in the process? Or am I wrong? Poison Ivy II is a slow moving, tepid, uneventful bore of a film that I really hated, at almost an hour & fifty minutes long I was seriously considering using the fast-forward button on many occasions & even the plot is a damp squib with hardly anything happening. There's a fight between Gredin & Donald at the end before Donald rather randomly walks off a roof for reasons I can't figure out but otherwise next to nothing happens. I haven't been this bored by a film in a while. Poison Ivy II has no edge, it's not dark enough, it has nothing relevant to say, it has zero entertainment value, it feels like it goes on forever, it's not thrilling or erotic &the connection to the original Poison Ivy is tenuous at best with the main florally named character Lily not acting like her anyway & quite why reading a diary would change her so drastically so quickly (like in a few hours) is hard to believe. No-one dies in this & I can't remember any violence, a young girl gets hit by a car but it's her own fault since she runs out in front of it & she's fine anyway so it doesn't count. Even the so-called erotic scenes are completely lacking, they are very short & very tame as to be almost inconsequential. Although competently made Poison Ivy II is bland & forgettable, sure leading lady Alyssa Milano is a nice looking bird but so what when the rest of the films such a bore to sit through? The laughably bad moral message at the end about being yourself is so corny, badly written & delivered I was left shaking my head & ever so slightly embarrassed. Rather randomly there's also this small character named Robert who just seems to sit in his room all day playing the Chello, I'm not sure what he to do with anything but at least he was dedicated. Probably a fairly low budget film Poison Ivy II has nothing going for it, it's drab & dull with no excitement or satisfying erotic content. The acting is average, I didn't think anyone came out with any great credit but then again I have seen worse performances I suppose. Poison Ivy II is one of the most boring & tepid films I have seen in ages, Lily doesn't do anything wrong so there's no edge & the moral nonsense about being yourself is just to badly done to be effective. Unfortunately two further Poison Ivy films have been made, Poison Ivy: The New Seduction (1997) & Poison Ivy: The Secret Society (2008). Please no more, just stop now, thanks.

    I've just finished watching this insanely bad movie, and I'm having trouble deciding which is worse - the script or the music. It's a tough choice. I actually was in the mood for a bad movie tonight, but a fun bad movie. And that's exactly what I expected from this. Also, I watched the unrated version, so I expected a few sexy moments. Sadly, there are none. There is nothing the least bit erotic about this movie. Even if you watched it with the sound off to avoid the horrible (and horribly intrusive) music, the lighting is so bad, and the shots so poorly composed, that the sex scenes are boring and irritating. And then there's the script. Johnathon Schaech's character has slept with Alyssa Milano's character twice and then says, "I don't even know who I'm making love to anymore." Really? After sleeping with her twice? It's after a Halloween party, and they've established that she showed up to campus two weeks after the semester started. So she's been there, what, a month? The back of the DVD box calls it an erotic thriller. It's not erotic, and the director tried to make it a thriller when there was just under 13 minutes left in the film. Suddenly there is a shadow lurking outside her window, and then someone coming up the stairs, with those ridiculous early 1980s-type shots. Right before this we had the only bit in the film that made me laugh - the teacher's child suddenly running out of the house in slow motion. Oh no, is she heading toward the road? What could possibly happen here? Will there be a car? Will she get hit? Will we get the closeup of the headlights? Will her stuffed animal go flying up in the air, also in slow motion? Of course. Terrible. How do the writer and director of this film live with themselves? And at the end, Alyssa Milano's character explains everything that she's done, everything that's happened in the film, in a sort of apology to Jonathon Schaech's character, while he seemingly ignores her and continues work on his backyard sculpture. And then when she's done telling us everything that we just watched, will she walk away, only to hear Jonathon Schaech say, "I love you"? And will the music swell insanely right then? And is that the end of the film? Yes, yes, yes.

    Personally I thought the film was very entertaining. The plot itself was very well planned out and the actors were fantastic. I'd describe this film as a great representation of a 90's genre flick, being that it was sensual and erotic while at the same time providing a thrilling storyline. As a fan of Alyssa Milano I'd say this was one of her best films and Jonathon Schaech did a great job in this film as well. More than just a movie full of sexual scenes, it touches and delves into a topic we can all relate to. I mean how many of us haven't imitated a person we've idolized? It's not unnatural to want to be like someone you thoroughly admire. Overall, this movie was very entertaining and worth the watch. If you're looking for a throwback to the good old 90's while getting to see some sensual action, then this is the movie for you. Definitely better than the first I'd say. But then, why don't you see for yourself?

    They ripped off the title from an earlier successful trashy movie, "Poison Ivy" with the all-grown-up Drew Barrymore as one of those seductive babysitters, and they ripped off the story from an earlier successful trashy movie, "Embrace of the Vampire" with the exuberantly nubile Alyssa Milano herself. That will give you an idea of how much creative effort went into the making of this film, which is to say, none that you'd notice. Here's the shamelessly permuted plot. Alyssa Milano, nice virginal girl, goes to a Bohemian art school, has an affair with an equally Bohemian guy, starts reading somebody else's diary, takes on some of the traits of the diarist, develops a crush on the sensitive but happily married guru in her painting class, begins to dress Goth, cuts her hair to a wicked length, begins to smoke (gasp!), treats her loving boyfriend recklessly, shuns her art teacher when he finally begins to put moves on her after she's practically thrown herself on him, bosom first, drives art instructor mad, destroys instructor's family, is discovered in flagrante delicto by the wife, throws her black girl friend out of her room, .... zzzzzzzz. The only conceivable reason to see this piece of atrocious offal is to see Alyssa Milano take off her clothes and/or simulate intercourse, which she doesn't do nearly often enough in my opinion as expert on art schools, the perils of wearing black garments, erotic cinema, and the contours of Milano's bosom. This is pretty crummy stuff we're dealing with here. Milano looks fine. How could she look otherwise? But her acting skills are modest, to put it kindly. Nice performance by her insane art instructor, though. Another plus for the androgyne who plays a soothing cello so that our ears are given a respite from the relentless WHANG of the score. I mean, look at this. After a wild party, her alarm wakes her for an early class with her mad art teacher. She rolls out of the bed she's occupying with her boy friend. While she's performing her morning ablutions off screen, her lover begins to complain that she's changing. She's becoming weird. "You're not yourself anymore. I don't know who I'm talking to. I don't know who I'm making love to." Should he really CARE? Whoever he's making love to, the face and body resemble that of Allysa Milano. And let's face facts == no man would ever organize that sort of statement, nor would any man even know what the words mean. "I don't know who I'm talking to"? A WOMAN would say it, but a man? And then, to top it all off, while they're having this faux conversation, she's slinking around the room apparently wearing his jockey shorts, the kind with the fly and double fabric in front so you can't see through them. Has such perfidy ever been shown on screen? Don't miss this if you can.

    Well,if you are Alyssa fan like me then this is the one which is surely not to be missed.Extremely tame story line and full of eroticism, the movie don't have much to offer in terms of any substance or plot.Lily(Alyssa Milano) is an art student who comes to California and join the drawing school.She rent the house nearby where she discovers the dairy of a women she has never met.The dairy is full of erotic desires & nude images which awakes passion in Lily and she become obsessed with the dairy,try to mould herself like that women....... But this is only one part of the story.Later its being shown that her art teacher is lustful about Lily,besides she is having a boyfriend also.Though movie is quite predictable and rather slow but there is no doubt that Alyssa Milano looked extremely cute & beautiful and totally the movie belonged to her.Sex scenes in the movie are rather unconventional but interesting.So inspite of having nothing the movie lives to its B-grade sex-flicks standard and as far as Alyssa fans are considered its a feast for them.

    wow......Alyssa Milano, dang i'll never watch Who's the Boss the same way ever again. She does have a banging body let me say that much,, as for the movie.. where do i start, well here goes nothing, the premise i thought was okay,, i mean finding a diary, then trying to be somebody y our'e not to gain attention,, hmmm., anyway, she discovers her body, and what she want to do,, she is betrayed, betrays others, and is downright cold. i didn't care for the ending though, but everything else in between made sense to me. This isn't a bad sequel,, i thought the original was better, but this one was more sensual, and had more depth to it sexually than the first. This film reminds me of like a Soft Core Porn almost, sort of like Nicolas Cage in Zandalee, but softer, overall not a bad pic,

No-one dies in this & I can't remember any violence, a young girl gets hit by a car but it's her own fault since she runs out in front of it & she's fine anyway so it doesn't count. Even the so-called erotic scenes are completely lacking, they are very short & very tame as to be almost inconsequential. Although competently made Poison Ivy II is bland & forgettable, sure leading lady Alyssa Milano is a nice looking bird but so what when the rest of the films such a bore to sit through? The laughably bad moral message at the end about being yourself is so corny, badly written & delivered I was left shaking my head & ever so slightly embarrassed. Rather randomly there's also this small character named Robert who just seems to sit in his room all day playing the Chello, I'm not sure what he to do with anything but at least he was dedicated. Probably a fairly low budget film Poison Ivy II has nothing going for it, it's drab & dull with no excitement or satisfying erotic content. The acting is average, I didn't think anyone came out with any great credit but then again I have seen worse performances I suppose. Poison Ivy II is one of the most boring & tepid films I have seen in ages, Lily doesn't do anything wrong so there's no edge & the moral nonsense about being yourself is just to badly done to be effective. Unfortunately two further Poison Ivy films have been made, Poison Ivy: The New Seduction (1997) & Poison Ivy: The Secret Society (2008). Please no more, just stop now, thanks.

    I've just finished watching this insanely bad movie, and I'm having trouble deciding which is worse - the script or the music. It's a tough choice. I actually was in the mood for a bad movie tonight, but a fun bad movie. And that's exactly what I expected from this. Also, I watched the unrated version, so I expected a few sexy moments. Sadly, there are none. There is nothing the least bit erotic about this movie. Even if you watched it with the sound off to avoid the horrible (and horribly intrusive) music, the lighting is so bad, and the shots so poorly composed, that the sex scenes are boring and irritating. And then there's the script. Johnathon Schaech's character has slept with Alyssa Milano's character twice and then says, "I don't even know who I'm making love to anymore." Really? After sleeping with her twice? It's after a Halloween party, and they've established that she showed up to campus two weeks after the semester started. So she's been there, what, a month? The back of the DVD box calls it an erotic thriller. It's not erotic, and the director tried to make it a thriller when there was just under 13 minutes left in the film. Suddenly there is a shadow lurking outside her window, and then someone coming up the stairs, with those ridiculous early 1980s-type shots. Right before this we had the only bit in the film that made me laugh - the teacher's child suddenly running out of the house in slow motion. Oh no, is she heading toward the road? What could possibly happen here? Will there be a car? Will she get hit? Will we get the closeup of the headlights? Will her stuffed animal go flying up in the air, also in slow motion? Of course. Terrible. How do the writer and director of this film live with themselves? And at the end, Alyssa Milano's character explains everything that she's done, everything that's happened in the film, in a sort of apology to Jonathon Schaech's character, while he seemingly ignores her and continues work on his backyard sculpture. And then when she's done telling us everything that we just watched, will she walk away, only to hear Jonathon Schaech say, "I love you"? And will the music swell insanely right then? And is that the end of the film? Yes, yes, yes.

    Personally I thought the film was very entertaining. The plot itself was very well planned out and the actors were fantastic. I'd describe this film as a great representation of a 90's genre flick, being that it was sensual and erotic while at the same time providing a thrilling storyline. As a fan of Alyssa Milano I'd say this was one of her best films and Jonathon Schaech did a great job in this film as well. More than just a movie full of sexual scenes, it touches and delves into a topic we can all relate to. I mean how many of us haven't imitated a person we've idolized? It's not unnatural to want to be like someone you thoroughly admire. Overall, this movie was very entertaining and worth the watch. If you're looking for a throwback to the good old 90's while getting to see some sensual action, then this is the movie for you. Definitely better than the first I'd say. But then, why don't you see for yourself?

    They ripped off the title from an earlier successful trashy movie, "Poison Ivy" with the all-grown-up Drew Barrymore as one of those seductive babysitters, and they ripped off the story from an earlier successful trashy movie, "Embrace of the Vampire" with the exuberantly nubile Alyssa Milano herself. That will give you an idea of how much creative effort went into the making of this film, which is to say, none that you'd notice. Here's the shamelessly permuted plot. Alyssa Milano, nice virginal girl, goes to a Bohemian art school, has an affair with an equally Bohemian guy, starts reading somebody else's diary, takes on some of the traits of the diarist, develops a crush on the sensitive but happily married guru in her painting class, begins to dress Goth, cuts her hair to a wicked length, begins to smoke (gasp!), treats her loving boyfriend recklessly, shuns her art teacher when he finally begins to put moves on her after she's practically thrown herself on him, bosom first, drives art instructor mad, destroys instructor's family, is discovered in flagrante delicto by the wife, throws her black girl friend out of her room, .... zzzzzzzz. The only conceivable reason to see this piece of atrocious offal is to see Alyssa Milano take off her clothes and/or simulate intercourse, which she doesn't do nearly often enough in my opinion as expert on art schools, the perils of wearing black garments, erotic cinema, and the contours of Milano's bosom. This is pretty crummy stuff we're dealing with here. Milano looks fine. How could she look otherwise? But her acting skills are modest, to put it kindly. Nice performance by her insane art instructor, though. Another plus for the androgyne who plays a soothing cello so that our ears are given a respite from the relentless WHANG of the score. I mean, look at this. After a wild party, her alarm wakes her for an early class with her mad art teacher. She rolls out of the bed she's occupying with her boy friend. While she's performing her morning ablutions off screen, her lover begins to complain that she's changing. She's becoming weird. "You're not yourself anymore. I don't know who I'm talking to. I don't know who I'm making love to." Should he really CARE? Whoever he's making love to, the face and body resemble that of Allysa Milano. And let's face facts == no man would ever organize that sort of statement, nor would any man even know what the words mean. "I don't know who I'm talking to"? A WOMAN would say it, but a man? And then, to top it all off, while they're having this faux conversation, she's slinking around the room apparently wearing his jockey shorts, the kind with the fly and double fabric in front so you can't see through them. Has such perfidy ever been shown on screen? Don't miss this if you can.

    Well,if you are Alyssa fan like me then this is the one which is surely not to be missed.Extremely tame story line and full of eroticism, the movie don't have much to offer in terms of any substance or plot.Lily(Alyssa Milano) is an art student who comes to California and join the drawing school.She rent the house nearby where she discovers the dairy of a women she has never met.The dairy is full of erotic desires & nude images which awakes passion in Lily and she become obsessed with the dairy,try to mould herself like that women....... But this is only one part of the story.Later its being shown that her art teacher is lustful about Lily,besides she is having a boyfriend also.Though movie is quite predictable and rather slow but there is no doubt that Alyssa Milano looked extremely cute & beautiful and totally the movie belonged to her.Sex scenes in the movie are rather unconventional but interesting.So inspite of having nothing the movie lives to its B-grade sex-flicks standard and as far as Alyssa fans are considered its a feast for them.

    wow......Alyssa Milano, dang i'll never watch Who's the Boss the same way ever again. She does have a banging body let me say that much,, as for the movie.. where do i start, well here goes nothing, the premise i thought was okay,, i mean finding a diary, then trying to be somebody y our'e not to gain attention,, hmmm., anyway, she discovers her body, and what she want to do,, she is betrayed, betrays others, and is downright cold. i didn't care for the ending though, but everything else in between made sense to me. This isn't a bad sequel,, i thought the original was better, but this one was more sensual, and had more depth to it sexually than the first. This film reminds me of like a Soft Core Porn almost, sort of like Nicolas Cage in Zandalee, but softer, overall not a bad pic,

    wow.i was disappointed in the first Poison Ivy movie,but compared to this movie,it is a masterpiece.this is one long,slow,tedious movie.the plot of the movie(if you can call it that,is incoherent.i would say it was ant climatic,but there is no climax,and without that,you can't have an anti climatic movie.to me,this movie is basically a soft core porn.i watched the whole movie hoping for some good to come out of it.no such luck.there are a few minutes of action,but not enough to redeem this movie.plus,i thought the dialogue was cringe worthy.i think the movie was just an excuse for people to get naked.anyway,i didn't like it at all.for me Poison Ivy II is a 1/10

    Here we have a sequel which has pretty much nothing to do with the first film in the series. Which is probably a good thing as that first film was quite terrible. Unfortunately this one is really no better. Alyssa Milano plays Lily, a shy girl from Michigan who goes to college in Los Angeles. There she comes out of her shell. And out of her clothes. Milano, at the point in her career where she felt the need to show how grown-up she was, dutifully doffs her top a few times. Honestly that's the only reason this movie exists, as a vehicle to put Milano on naked display. And again being honest that's probably the only reason anyone would ever watch this movie. You want a topless Alyssa Milano you got it. You want a decent movie you are well and truly out of luck. Whereas Ivy, the central figure in the first film, was an unapologetic seductress and homewrecker Lily is a good girl at heart. A bit clueless but good nonetheless. Anyhow her pervy art professor tries to take advantage of her. And one of her fellow students treats her badly and publicly humiliates her so she of course immediately sleeps with him. Eventually she tries to tap into her darker, more seductive side but that effort fails rather miserably. Some other weirdos float around on the periphery of the story and eventually it all comes to an end in what may be the worst final fifteen minutes of any movie ever. The movie had very little going for it throughout and in that ending it completely falls apart. It's an ending which piles one laughable absurdity upon another. The movie's supposed to be a thriller but it ends up as an unintentional comedy. Sadly it's not even a good unintentional comedy. The story stinks, the dialogue is pitiful, the acting is generally terrible and the obtrusive music is just painful. This is a movie with nothing to recommend it. If you're just here for Alyssa Milano's breasts enjoy them. You won't enjoy anything else.

    Lily (Alyssa Milano) is a shy Michigan art student who has somehow managed to secure herself a place at an LA college despite her pathetic scribblings resembling that of an average twelve year old. Soon after moving into her student lodgings, Lily discovers a diary that once belonged to Ivy, the disturbed babe played by Drew Barrymore in the first film. Inspired by Ivy's confidence and fearlessness, Lily adopts a new, more seductive persona to help her overcome her reservations and be accepted by her peers. Having briefly held a reputation for being a wild child, hottie Alyssa Milano must have seemed like the obvious choice to follow in Drew Barrymore's footsteps for this sequel to Poison Ivy; but despite Milano happily shedding her clothes to indulge in several steamy soft-core sex scenes, Poison Ivy 2 proves to be less fun than the original movie. Barrymore's Ivy was damaged goods: an unpredictable loose cannon, she exuded a genuine air of sexual danger, and yet this 'bad-girl' was still worthy of our compassion, her damaged psyche clearly the result of a very troubled childhood. In short, she was complex as well as sexy. Poison Ivy 2's Lily has a far less valid excuse for her wanton behaviour: her upbringing apparently trauma-free, Lily is simply desperate to be popular and feels that the best way to achieve this is to act like a total slut. It doesn't make her very endearing (alluring yes, but not exactly likable) or particularly interesting. The male characters in this film are as equally vapid and unagreeable: Lily's sculptor boyfriend Gredin (Johnathon Schaech) is a clingy pretty boy who proves to be as bland as his 'art', while lustful teacher Donald Falk (Xander Berkeley) is not only an adulterous sleaze-bag but every bit as bad an artist as his students. After lots of fairly unexceptional eroticism, during which Milano flashes her tits a lot (yayy!), Poison Ivy 2 moves into predictable thriller mode for the final&eacute;, a frustrated Falk getting his rape on with temptress Lily, only to be caught in the act by Gredin, Falk's wife Angela (Belinda Bauer) and his daughter Daphne (a young Camilla Belle), and then become a knife wielding lunatic destined to die by the closing credits. Poison Ivy 2 is available in both rated and unrated versions on Region 1, but unrated is clearly the way to go, with several minutes more of Alyssa in the buff being a naughty, naughty girl.

    This is a first class stinker of major proportions. A young girl goes off to art school in California, leaving her home in Michigan. Her parents call once to speak to her and despite their so called concern, you never hear from them again. The movie is unbearably slow moving. It essentially comes down to the young lady supposedly asserting herself by getting involved in simultaneous affairs with both her art professor and a fellow student. Our heroine is more like a witch. She is really the embodiment of a possessive misery and that word is most appropriate to describe this dull film with an unhappy ending.

    Poison Ivy II is set in Los Angeles as a teenage student named Lily Leonetti (Alyssa Milano) arrives two weeks late for the start of her life study art class at university having been delayed in Michigan. Shy, retiring & modest Lily is a very pretty girl who attracts the attention of local hunk Gredin (Jonathon Schaech) & her art class teacher Donald (Xander Berkeley). While at home in a university dorm Lily finds a box in her wardrobe, inside the box are some slutty clothes & & diary that belonged to the last resident, a girl named Ivy. Lily is fascinated by the diary & Ivy's thoughts, Lily starts to copy Ivy & think like her as she cuts her hair, gets a piercing & starts to wear very revealing clothes as she tries to decide whether she wants to date Gredin or Donald. Lily settles on Gredin but Donald won't let her go as easily as Lily would like & things turn violent as lives are torn apart... Directed by Anne Goursaud this was the first sequel to the erotic thriller Poison Ivy (1992) whose only claim to fame is that it starred a young Drew Barrymore but otherwise was total crap, I saw the original Poison Ivy only last week & really didn't like it at all so while my expectations for Poison Ivy II weren't high even I was unprepared for just how bad this is. It's interesting to note that the script was written by someone called Chloe King so if we then remember the director was also a woman you could say that the main creative driving forces behind Poison Ivy II are women & it's maybe no surprise that it's the men who turn out to be the biggest scumbags here. In fact Lily does very little wrong here, she certainly doesn't do anything illegal or physically hurt anyone & it's the art teacher who goes all mental & comes across as the real villain of the film. Sure Lilly leads him on a little bit & flirts between the young hunky Gredin & the older married Donald but otherwise does nothing even remotely evil or dangerous or nasty. I thought the whole point of a Poison Ivy film was that it was the woman who was the seductive evildoer who used her looks & manipulative charm to get what she wanted & ruin lives in the process? Or am I wrong? Poison Ivy II is a slow moving, tepid, uneventful bore of a film that I really hated, at almost an hour & fifty minutes long I was seriously considering using the fast-forward button on many occasions & even the plot is a damp squib with hardly anything happening. There's a fight between Gredin & Donald at the end before Donald rather randomly walks off a roof for reasons I can't figure out but otherwise next to nothing happens. I haven't been this bored by a film in a while. Poison Ivy II has no edge, it's not dark enough, it has nothing relevant to say, it has zero entertainment value, it feels like it goes on forever, it's not thrilling or erotic &the connection to the original Poison Ivy is tenuous at best with the main florally named character Lily not acting like her anyway & quite why reading a diary would change her so drastically so quickly (like in a few hours) is hard to believe. No-one dies in this & I can't remember any violence, a young girl gets hit by a car but it's her own fault since she runs out in front of it & she's fine anyway so it doesn't count. Even the so-called erotic scenes are completely lacking, they are very short & very tame as to be almost inconsequential.

This film reminds me of like a Soft Core Porn almost, sort of like Nicolas Cage in Zandalee, but softer, overall not a bad pic,

    Here we have a sequel which has pretty much nothing to do with the first film in the series. Which is probably a good thing as that first film was quite terrible. Unfortunately this one is really no better. Alyssa Milano plays Lily, a shy girl from Michigan who goes to college in Los Angeles. There she comes out of her shell. And out of her clothes. Milano, at the point in her career where she felt the need to show how grown-up she was, dutifully doffs her top a few times. Honestly that's the only reason this movie exists, as a vehicle to put Milano on naked display. And again being honest that's probably the only reason anyone would ever watch this movie. You want a topless Alyssa Milano you got it. You want a decent movie you are well and truly out of luck. Whereas Ivy, the central figure in the first film, was an unapologetic seductress and homewrecker Lily is a good girl at heart. A bit clueless but good nonetheless. Anyhow her pervy art professor tries to take advantage of her. And one of her fellow students treats her badly and publicly humiliates her so she of course immediately sleeps with him. Eventually she tries to tap into her darker, more seductive side but that effort fails rather miserably. Some other weirdos float around on the periphery of the story and eventually it all comes to an end in what may be the worst final fifteen minutes of any movie ever. The movie had very little going for it throughout and in that ending it completely falls apart. It's an ending which piles one laughable absurdity upon another. The movie's supposed to be a thriller but it ends up as an unintentional comedy. Sadly it's not even a good unintentional comedy. The story stinks, the dialogue is pitiful, the acting is generally terrible and the obtrusive music is just painful. This is a movie with nothing to recommend it. If you're just here for Alyssa Milano's breasts enjoy them. You won't enjoy anything else.

    Lily (Alyssa Milano) is a shy Michigan art student who has somehow managed to secure herself a place at an LA college despite her pathetic scribblings resembling that of an average twelve year old. Soon after moving into her student lodgings, Lily discovers a diary that once belonged to Ivy, the disturbed babe played by Drew Barrymore in the first film. Inspired by Ivy's confidence and fearlessness, Lily adopts a new, more seductive persona to help her overcome her reservations and be accepted by her peers. Having briefly held a reputation for being a wild child, hottie Alyssa Milano must have seemed like the obvious choice to follow in Drew Barrymore's footsteps for this sequel to Poison Ivy; but despite Milano happily shedding her clothes to indulge in several steamy soft-core sex scenes, Poison Ivy 2 proves to be less fun than the original movie. Barrymore's Ivy was damaged goods: an unpredictable loose cannon, she exuded a genuine air of sexual danger, and yet this 'bad-girl' was still worthy of our compassion, her damaged psyche clearly the result of a very troubled childhood. In short, she was complex as well as sexy. Poison Ivy 2's Lily has a far less valid excuse for her wanton behaviour: her upbringing apparently trauma-free, Lily is simply desperate to be popular and feels that the best way to achieve this is to act like a total slut. It doesn't make her very endearing (alluring yes, but not exactly likable) or particularly interesting. The male characters in this film are as equally vapid and unagreeable: Lily's sculptor boyfriend Gredin (Johnathon Schaech) is a clingy pretty boy who proves to be as bland as his 'art', while lustful teacher Donald Falk (Xander Berkeley) is not only an adulterous sleaze-bag but every bit as bad an artist as his students. After lots of fairly unexceptional eroticism, during which Milano flashes her tits a lot (yayy!), Poison Ivy 2 moves into predictable thriller mode for the final&eacute;, a frustrated Falk getting his rape on with temptress Lily, only to be caught in the act by Gredin, Falk's wife Angela (Belinda Bauer) and his daughter Daphne (a young Camilla Belle), and then become a knife wielding lunatic destined to die by the closing credits. Poison Ivy 2 is available in both rated and unrated versions on Region 1, but unrated is clearly the way to go, with several minutes more of Alyssa in the buff being a naughty, naughty girl.

    This is a first class stinker of major proportions. A young girl goes off to art school in California, leaving her home in Michigan. Her parents call once to speak to her and despite their so called concern, you never hear from them again. The movie is unbearably slow moving. It essentially comes down to the young lady supposedly asserting herself by getting involved in simultaneous affairs with both her art professor and a fellow student. Our heroine is more like a witch. She is really the embodiment of a possessive misery and that word is most appropriate to describe this dull film with an unhappy ending.

    Poison Ivy II is set in Los Angeles as a teenage student named Lily Leonetti (Alyssa Milano) arrives two weeks late for the start of her life study art class at university having been delayed in Michigan. Shy, retiring & modest Lily is a very pretty girl who attracts the attention of local hunk Gredin (Jonathon Schaech) & her art class teacher Donald (Xander Berkeley). While at home in a university dorm Lily finds a box in her wardrobe, inside the box are some slutty clothes & & diary that belonged to the last resident, a girl named Ivy. Lily is fascinated by the diary & Ivy's thoughts, Lily starts to copy Ivy & think like her as she cuts her hair, gets a piercing & starts to wear very revealing clothes as she tries to decide whether she wants to date Gredin or Donald. Lily settles on Gredin but Donald won't let her go as easily as Lily would like & things turn violent as lives are torn apart... Directed by Anne Goursaud this was the first sequel to the erotic thriller Poison Ivy (1992) whose only claim to fame is that it starred a young Drew Barrymore but otherwise was total crap, I saw the original Poison Ivy only last week & really didn't like it at all so while my expectations for Poison Ivy II weren't high even I was unprepared for just how bad this is. It's interesting to note that the script was written by someone called Chloe King so if we then remember the director was also a woman you could say that the main creative driving forces behind Poison Ivy II are women & it's maybe no surprise that it's the men who turn out to be the biggest scumbags here. In fact Lily does very little wrong here, she certainly doesn't do anything illegal or physically hurt anyone & it's the art teacher who goes all mental & comes across as the real villain of the film. Sure Lilly leads him on a little bit & flirts between the young hunky Gredin & the older married Donald but otherwise does nothing even remotely evil or dangerous or nasty. I thought the whole point of a Poison Ivy film was that it was the woman who was the seductive evildoer who used her looks & manipulative charm to get what she wanted & ruin lives in the process? Or am I wrong? Poison Ivy II is a slow moving, tepid, uneventful bore of a film that I really hated, at almost an hour & fifty minutes long I was seriously considering using the fast-forward button on many occasions & even the plot is a damp squib with hardly anything happening. There's a fight between Gredin & Donald at the end before Donald rather randomly walks off a roof for reasons I can't figure out but otherwise next to nothing happens. I haven't been this bored by a film in a while. Poison Ivy II has no edge, it's not dark enough, it has nothing relevant to say, it has zero entertainment value, it feels like it goes on forever, it's not thrilling or erotic &the connection to the original Poison Ivy is tenuous at best with the main florally named character Lily not acting like her anyway & quite why reading a diary would change her so drastically so quickly (like in a few hours) is hard to believe. No-one dies in this & I can't remember any violence, a young girl gets hit by a car but it's her own fault since she runs out in front of it & she's fine anyway so it doesn't count. Even the so-called erotic scenes are completely lacking, they are very short & very tame as to be almost inconsequential. Although competently made Poison Ivy II is bland & forgettable, sure leading lady Alyssa Milano is a nice looking bird but so what when the rest of the films such a bore to sit through? The laughably bad moral message at the end about being yourself is so corny, badly written & delivered I was left shaking my head & ever so slightly embarrassed. Rather randomly there's also this small character named Robert who just seems to sit in his room all day playing the Chello, I'm not sure what he to do with anything but at least he was dedicated. Probably a fairly low budget film Poison Ivy II has nothing going for it, it's drab & dull with no excitement or satisfying erotic content. The acting is average, I didn't think anyone came out with any great credit but then again I have seen worse performances I suppose. Poison Ivy II is one of the most boring & tepid films I have seen in ages, Lily doesn't do anything wrong so there's no edge & the moral nonsense about being yourself is just to badly done to be effective. Unfortunately two further Poison Ivy films have been made, Poison Ivy: The New Seduction (1997) & Poison Ivy: The Secret Society (2008). Please no more, just stop now, thanks.

    I've just finished watching this insanely bad movie, and I'm having trouble deciding which is worse - the script or the music. It's a tough choice. I actually was in the mood for a bad movie tonight, but a fun bad movie. And that's exactly what I expected from this. Also, I watched the unrated version, so I expected a few sexy moments. Sadly, there are none. There is nothing the least bit erotic about this movie. Even if you watched it with the sound off to avoid the horrible (and horribly intrusive) music, the lighting is so bad, and the shots so poorly composed, that the sex scenes are boring and irritating. And then there's the script. Johnathon Schaech's character has slept with Alyssa Milano's character twice and then says, "I don't even know who I'm making love to anymore." Really? After sleeping with her twice? It's after a Halloween party, and they've established that she showed up to campus two weeks after the semester started. So she's been there, what, a month? The back of the DVD box calls it an erotic thriller. It's not erotic, and the director tried to make it a thriller when there was just under 13 minutes left in the film. Suddenly there is a shadow lurking outside her window, and then someone coming up the stairs, with those ridiculous early 1980s-type shots. Right before this we had the only bit in the film that made me laugh - the teacher's child suddenly running out of the house in slow motion. Oh no, is she heading toward the road? What could possibly happen here? Will there be a car? Will she get hit? Will we get the closeup of the headlights? Will her stuffed animal go flying up in the air, also in slow motion? Of course. Terrible. How do the writer and director of this film live with themselves? And at the end, Alyssa Milano's character explains everything that she's done, everything that's happened in the film, in a sort of apology to Jonathon Schaech's character, while he seemingly ignores her and continues work on his backyard sculpture. And then when she's done telling us everything that we just watched, will she walk away, only to hear Jonathon Schaech say, "I love you"? And will the music swell insanely right then? And is that the end of the film? Yes, yes, yes.

    Personally I thought the film was very entertaining. The plot itself was very well planned out and the actors were fantastic. I'd describe this film as a great representation of a 90's genre flick, being that it was sensual and erotic while at the same time providing a thrilling storyline. As a fan of Alyssa Milano I'd say this was one of her best films and Jonathon Schaech did a great job in this film as well. More than just a movie full of sexual scenes, it touches and delves into a topic we can all relate to. I mean how many of us haven't imitated a person we've idolized? It's not unnatural to want to be like someone you thoroughly admire. Overall, this movie was very entertaining and worth the watch. If you're looking for a throwback to the good old 90's while getting to see some sensual action, then this is the movie for you. Definitely better than the first I'd say. But then, why don't you see for yourself?

    They ripped off the title from an earlier successful trashy movie, "Poison Ivy" with the all-grown-up Drew Barrymore as one of those seductive babysitters, and they ripped off the story from an earlier successful trashy movie, "Embrace of the Vampire" with the exuberantly nubile Alyssa Milano herself. That will give you an idea of how much creative effort went into the making of this film, which is to say, none that you'd notice. Here's the shamelessly permuted plot. Alyssa Milano, nice virginal girl, goes to a Bohemian art school, has an affair with an equally Bohemian guy, starts reading somebody else's diary, takes on some of the traits of the diarist, develops a crush on the sensitive but happily married guru in her painting class, begins to dress Goth, cuts her hair to a wicked length, begins to smoke (gasp!), treats her loving boyfriend recklessly, shuns her art teacher when he finally begins to put moves on her after she's practically thrown herself on him, bosom first, drives art instructor mad, destroys instructor's family, is discovered in flagrante delicto by the wife, throws her black girl friend out of her room, .... zzzzzzzz. The only conceivable reason to see this piece of atrocious offal is to see Alyssa Milano take off her clothes and/or simulate intercourse, which she doesn't do nearly often enough in my opinion as expert on art schools, the perils of wearing black garments, erotic cinema, and the contours of Milano's bosom. This is pretty crummy stuff we're dealing with here. Milano looks fine. How could she look otherwise? But her acting skills are modest, to put it kindly. Nice performance by her insane art instructor, though. Another plus for the androgyne who plays a soothing cello so that our ears are given a respite from the relentless WHANG of the score. I mean, look at this. After a wild party, her alarm wakes her for an early class with her mad art teacher. She rolls out of the bed she's occupying with her boy friend. While she's performing her morning ablutions off screen, her lover begins to complain that she's changing. She's becoming weird. "You're not yourself anymore. I don't know who I'm talking to. I don't know who I'm making love to." Should he really CARE? Whoever he's making love to, the face and body resemble that of Allysa Milano. And let's face facts == no man would ever organize that sort of statement, nor would any man even know what the words mean. "I don't know who I'm talking to"? A WOMAN would say it, but a man? And then, to top it all off, while they're having this faux conversation, she's slinking around the room apparently wearing his jockey shorts, the kind with the fly and double fabric in front so you can't see through them. Has such perfidy ever been shown on screen? Don't miss this if you can.

    Well,if you are Alyssa fan like me then this is the one which is surely not to be missed.Extremely tame story line and full of eroticism, the movie don't have much to offer in terms of any substance or plot.Lily(Alyssa Milano) is an art student who comes to California and join the drawing school.She rent the house nearby where she discovers the dairy of a women she has never met.The dairy is full of erotic desires & nude images which awakes passion in Lily and she become obsessed with the dairy,try to mould herself like that women....... But this is only one part of the story.Later its being shown that her art teacher is lustful about Lily,besides she is having a boyfriend also.Though movie is quite predictable and rather slow but there is no doubt that Alyssa Milano looked extremely cute & beautiful and totally the movie belonged to her.Sex scenes in the movie are rather unconventional but interesting.So inspite of having nothing the movie lives to its B-grade sex-flicks standard and as far as Alyssa fans are considered its a feast for them.
