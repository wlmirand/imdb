    I have truly loved the Narnia books by Clive Staples Lewis since I was 7. I have a memory of staying up late in bed, reading the last few chapters of "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" before seeing the movie the next day. Little did I know of C. S. Lewis' (Jack) personal life. He was a very reserved man as is shown here, and he doesn't have much of a life outside of teaching and writing. That is, until he meets Joy Gresham, an American woman living a hard life with her abusive husband and young son. Jack takes them in and for the first time, begins to love like he never thought he could. There is much more to this film than what meets the eye. It it is a story of compassion, love, loss, grief, and faith. As a Christian, it is wonderful to see a film with such deep and moral messages that revolve and even feel aimed, at me specifically. Anthony Hopkins does a magnificent job in portraying the famous and troubled writer. This is a movie worth watching again and again.

    I'm impressed with the volume of favorable reviews of this film. If you've gone this far, there's no reason at all for me to rehash the plot, the marvelous acting, or the directorial skills displayed here. If I may add something new to the reviews, I would like to say that it's a sad world where Anthony Hopkins is much more known for his portrayal of Hannibal Lechter in The Silence Of The Lambs franchise. I despised those movies, not because I don't like horrific flicks. Check out my other reviews if you think I'm a sob sister who just can't take it. But this is not a review of those films, so I'll proceed...What makes this film rise to greatness is it's portrayal of a man who thinks he has life, the universe, and everything, all wrapped up in a tidy intellectual package, and then finds himself doing and feeling things which force him to completely reevaluate the foundations of his life and faith. I can't help but think that there are many Christians who considered the subject of C. S. Lewis to be safe ground to venture through. Those who only know him through his Narnia stories, and the approval given for those films by their clergy, must have been quite surprised to find the man willing to break immigration laws to wed a somewhat bohemian woman for reasons of citizenship. I hope that those who first recoil at the truth of his life, grow as Lewis did as he faced the contradictions to his smug, self satisfied, view of himself and his faith. If you're a macho man who can't imagine himself capable of crying at a film, get ready to have the rug pulled out from under your pretension. This film hits notes of truth in sadness that are specifically male, and completely missing from 99.99% of cinematography. You will cry not because you are manipulated, but because you recognize yourself in this gentle intellectual facing the glory of love, the pain of unfair tragedy, and the responsibility that endures beyond the drama. Whoever you are, whatever you believe, watch this wonderful film. Share it with a loved one.

    Richard Attenboroughs best directorial piece. This is the true story about C.S.Lewis...an above average English novelist. The year is 1951 when he meets a fan( a U.S.A. lady) played by Debra Winger. Lewis gives us the very strong impression..that he does not know how to..."do it". Well there was no internet then..!! He tries a weak kiss...but it doesn't really work... Winger puts on an ..."&Iuml; know its very complex" act as she attempts to give reassurance. There is a huge stop sign for these fine people...and it says STOP. Winger develops terminal cancer..which is never a good sign......C.S.--- Decides to fall in love with this...USA....lady ...and marries her. It really is a fine film...even if the young kids wont get it. They will be looking for...Super--Heroes, or Will Ferrel. Is there a difference..???.....Both are not funny..... A good...movie,,,,,if you are over 32

    Movies don't always have to have an exciting premise. Sometimes a touching romance is not about two passionate young lovers but about an older couple finding each other long after their well-travelled youth. Shadowlands does not even have The African Queen's adventuresome setting, being set amid the quietness of 1950s Oxford. And yet it has on its side exceptional writing, deep humanity and good taste. Based by writer William Nicholson on an episode in the life of author C.S. Lewis, every scene is like a warm and meticulously sculpted syllabub, a little slice of human interaction that, whether joyful, angry or sad seems shot through with affection and universal truth. The picture benefits considerably from the sublime tranquillity of its lead man Anthony Hopkins. Blessed with such a piercing gaze, Hopkins has never needed to do anything ostentatious to hold our attention, but this is not to say his acting is simple. Shadowlands sees him moving in the depths of serene understatement, portraying a man not so much repressed as sparing in his emotional expression. When he does have a few outbursts towards the end of the movie, the effect hits us all the harder. On the other hand, Debra Winger seems to me a rather lazy choice for the role of Joy Gresham, since her most successful role prior to that had been in Terms of Endearment as another woman dying of cancer. She gives a decent account of herself though, showing us a woman with a hard exterior around a warm heart. Richard Attenborough has never been anything more than a mediocre director of drama or comedy or action, or anything. But he does have a few exceptional qualities, and one is the beauty with which he endows his work. There are several moments in Shadowlands, such as when Hopkins and Winger ascend a narrow staircase onto a tower top, or wend their way through the Herefordshire countryside, that something quietly breathtaking will slowly steal across the shot. Attenborough gives us a feeling of awe at landscapes and cityscapes without drawing too much obvious attention to them. Above all he directs with a slow subtlety that grants the picture its necessary dignity. One of the strangest things about it all was that when he helmed this movie he had just come back from playing a man with a bad Scots accent in Jurassic Park. Despite being all about the man, Shadowlands barely mentions the high fantasy of Lewis's Narnia novels for which he is best-known. The fact that he is famous for his work in fact seems entirely inconsequential to the story. Rather, it's the case that a handful of real events of his life have provided a story in themselves. This is a picture that is often profoundly moving in its normality.

    "Shadowlands" is possibly the most emotionally resonant, evocative film made in the 1990s, and it is amazing that this motion picture has not been available on region 1 DVD for many years. Anthony Hopkins plays the Oxford don well, though his Welsh-accented English would have been more accurate had it an Irish tinge instead. Debra Winger is an appealing choice for Joy Gresham, but her Brooklyn accent comes and goes, sometimes within a single scene. She could have used a language coach. Though much attention is paid to period detail (1952), it is jarring to see some post-Beatles moptops on several of Lewis' Oxford colleagues (Christopher Riley, marvellously played by John Wood, for one) and their scenes spoil the illusion somewhat. The film ends with a crisis of faith for C. S. Lewis after the death of his beloved Joy, which doubtless resonated with many viewers who have no particular convictions, but in truth Lewis' faith in Jesus Christ was renewed yet again. Lord Richard Attenborough did a fine job of direction, as did George Fenton with the film's score, and William Nicholson who adapted his own stage play. The resulting movie, whether intentional or not, shares some of the same ambiance as "Love Letters" and "Brief Encounter" (both filmed in 1945).

    Shadowlands is a wonderful movie, for so many reasons: the fact that it is about the author of the Narnia books (many people know nothing about him except for "Narnia"), the beautiful interiors and the academic, time-honoured atmosphere at the old university, philosophical thoughts, poetical language, the fact that Anthony Hopkins had the lead (everything with Antony Hopkins in it automatically becomes sublime!)... One wishes that one could have had a teacher like Lewis/Hopkins when one was young! :-) But best of all was the love story, of course. It was very romantic when the bogus marriage turned into real love, and the couple got married for real with a priest! This is of course a not uncommon theme in romantic movies - but this time it was about real people, and it had happened just like that in reality, which made the impact on the viewer even stronger! ...and it was of course even more tragic when Joy (the American wife) died, as love had come to C.S. Lewis so late in life... The reasons I give the movie "only" 9 stars instead of 10, are two. First, I did not find the American woman very sympathetic. It would have been much more fun with a nicer and more beautiful woman as Lewis'/Hopkins' great love... Of course it might be that she is portrayed accurately, but as the portrait of Lewis is also romanticized (he was not as handsome or charming as Hopkins! :-) ), the filmmakers could have used their poetical license to make the wife a more lovable character as well! The other reason is that I found the movie just a little too slow and long. It would have been a great improvement if they had shortened the slow parts with 10-15 minutes all in all.

    Immensely moving, with a stunning, complex performance by Anthony Hopkins, and a very good one by Debra Winger as his slow developing love. Yes, it's corny in a few moments, obvious in a few others, but overall this is a highly intelligent, thoughtful, subtle look at damaged adults reaching for love and dealing with loss. By far my favorite of Attenborough's films. A 'tearjerker', but elevated way beyond that by the writing, direction and acting, into a profound examination of the way we need love to lift us up, while that very thing makes us so vulnerable. Ironically, while this may be the strongest of Attenborough's films, with a stellar cast, great reviews, a fascinating main character (The novelist C.S. Lewis), and powerful universal emotions, it has long been unavailable on DVD. It seems almost a forgotten film, which is everyone's loss.

    This is a very strange film, a most extraordinary film. C.S. Lewis and his brother are two unmarried professors in Oxford, living together in the same house. They are living in this haven of peace that Oxford is, entirely dedicated to learning and knowledge, to the maturation of men in the teenagers they get every year, year in and year out. It is their function, their aim, their target and they cannot be derailed from this perspective. Oxford is their own territory and their own world and the world has no limits within these limits of Oxford, and an eventual trip to London for a lecture, but never beyond. C.S. Lewis is a special case in that entirely ghettoized intellectual world. He writes stories for children, for the children he will never have. These stories are about a strange world beyond the bottom of a wardrobe in the attic of his home. A world of bad and evil, of fighting for good and against evil. And yet his life is a routine that would kill thinking out of any human being. But not him, and plenty others around him. They are righteously living in the comfort of academia. The top echelon of that academia. Till one day when an American woman and her young child comes up and asks for an autograph. And the ghetto implodes. The peace is gone, love takes its place. The diplomatic marriage will eventually give way to a real marriage, but on a sick bed in a hospital. She finds out, too late of course, she has bone cancer and will eventually and soon die. And that's how C.S. Lewis discovers there is another love he had never really thought of and certainly not experienced: love for another human being that becomes your horizon and for whom you are dawn and dusk at the same time. That love that makes you mute and talkative in the same minute, so much the one and so much the other that your tongue trips on your muteness and your words get strangled in your talk. Love as a feeling of total gift of yourself to the other and of the other to yourself, with the tremendous responsibility that goes along with it. And death then becomes an unacceptable step away from this reality. Death comes and love will never go away and will turn into suffering, longing, wanting, needing and never getting the satisfaction you could ever wish to get. Love is for life I was going to say, oh yes, love is for life and even beyond life, for death if it comes and when it comes. Love never turns into ashes and never goes back to dirt because it is not dirt, it is the soul of the heart and the mind of life. And that's what C.S. Lewis actually discovers late in his life and never forgot after that. He finally learned how to be a fully blooming man, but it hurts so much when you learn love from within the death of your beloved. I must say the slow rhythm of the film, the very intimates scenes, the delicacy of the language and the acting, and the art of Anthony Hopkins serve that theme so well, so beautifully. It seems to be able to last for ever and ever, and yet the young son, now step-son, is there to remind you the show of life goes on for ever and ever on the stage of the strutting human beings we are.

    Richard Attenborough is a classy fellow who deserves to be recognized as a great film director. His more recent "Grey Owl" is brilliant! This film moves the heart like no other film I have ever witnessed! "Forrest Gump" gently touches the nerve endings. This film rams the gut! But what a classy production this is all the way through. A beautiful mellifluous script with tenderly rendered scenes of sensitive acting will have any audience in full approbation clamouring for more. I have said enough. You will cry in this one. Hopkins as a leading man makes C.S. Lewis human. This is a wonderful, tender, gentle-paced film that will stand the test of time! Mark my words! Own it today!

    Many years ago I read C.S. Lewis' wonderful book "A Grief Observed" - essentially his journal of his journey to rediscover his faith after the death from cancer of his wife Joy Gresham. I didn't deliberately steal the concept from Lewis, but perhaps he was at the back of my mind, since now, as a pastor, I often at funerals remind mourners that "grief is the price we pay for love." A concept similar to a central theme in both that book and this movie. This movie, which deals with the Lewis-Gresham relationship, surprised me in some ways. I had their relationship burned into my memory as a sudden and passionate thing, with Lewis being swept off his feet by this vivacious American divorc&eacute;e. Instead, we see here a picture of a very cautious relationship that develops slowly. Lewis, the lifelong bachelor, meets Gresham and is clearly taken with her, but always maintains a distance. Even when they marry, it's - in Lewis' words - only "technically," so that Joy can claim his British citizenship as her own. The romance - the open acknowledgement of love - comes only after her diagnosis, when Lewis is forced to confront the fact that she gives his life meaning, and that he can't imagine life without her, and they're married "properly" - by clergy, before God and without hiding the fact. Then, of course, there is the remission of her cancer, its return and her death, which forces Lewis to re-evaluate everything he believes about God, in the end, coming back to the realization that pain is a part of happiness, and that God is not to be blamed for Joy's death, but thanked for her life. Although the movie is spiritual, it's not in your face religious. It's a human movie; a sensitive movie - in the end, it's very moving. There's a lot of theological reflection that takes place on the relationship between suffering and faith, pain and happiness and how God fits into the picture, but there's nothing here that demands that one be a believer to enjoy this. It's fascinating to see the evolution of Lewis, who - by the sudden love he feels for Joy - has to change virtually everything about his life; perhaps best summed up by the bedroom scene, in which, on the first night they share a room together, Joy asks him what his routine is. He describes it, but then admits that he doesn't know what to do now that she's part of it. She says something like "you do everything you did before, then you just lie down - and I'm here." That exchange summed up both the gentleness of the movie and the challenge for Lewis of re-evaluating his entire life and everything he believed. C.S. Lewis is best known, of course, as an author of children's books. Fewer people realize that he was also quite an accomplished theologian. Regardless of how you think of him, though, he is a fascinating man, and while this movie is certainly gentle rather than exciting and romantic rather than passionate, it provides a fascinating glimpse of his spiritual journey. One also shouldn't overlook the excellent performances from Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger in the lead roles. 8/10

    Shadowlands is a wonderful movie, for so many reasons: the fact that it is about the author of the Narnia books (many people know nothing about him except for "Narnia"), the beautiful interiors and the academic, time-honoured atmosphere at the old university, philosophical thoughts, poetical language, the fact that Anthony Hopkins had the lead (everything with Antony Hopkins in it automatically becomes sublime!)... One wishes that one could have had a teacher like Lewis/Hopkins when one was young! :-) But best of all was the love story, of course. It was very romantic when the bogus marriage turned into real love, and the couple got married for real with a priest! This is of course a not uncommon theme in romantic movies - but this time it was about real people, and it had happened just like that in reality, which made the impact on the viewer even stronger! ...and it was of course even more tragic when Joy (the American wife) died, as love had come to C.S. Lewis so late in life... The reasons I give the movie "only" 9 stars instead of 10, are two. First, I did not find the American woman very sympathetic. It would have been much more fun with a nicer and more beautiful woman as Lewis'/Hopkins' great love... Of course it might be that she is portrayed accurately, but as the portrait of Lewis is also romanticized (he was not as handsome or charming as Hopkins! :-) ), the filmmakers could have used their poetical license to make the wife a more lovable character as well! The other reason is that I found the movie just a little too slow and long. It would have been a great improvement if they had shortened the slow parts with 10-15 minutes all in all.

    Immensely moving, with a stunning, complex performance by Anthony Hopkins, and a very good one by Debra Winger as his slow developing love. Yes, it's corny in a few moments, obvious in a few others, but overall this is a highly intelligent, thoughtful, subtle look at damaged adults reaching for love and dealing with loss. By far my favorite of Attenborough's films. A 'tearjerker', but elevated way beyond that by the writing, direction and acting, into a profound examination of the way we need love to lift us up, while that very thing makes us so vulnerable. Ironically, while this may be the strongest of Attenborough's films, with a stellar cast, great reviews, a fascinating main character (The novelist C.S. Lewis), and powerful universal emotions, it has long been unavailable on DVD. It seems almost a forgotten film, which is everyone's loss.

    This is a very strange film, a most extraordinary film. C.S. Lewis and his brother are two unmarried professors in Oxford, living together in the same house. They are living in this haven of peace that Oxford is, entirely dedicated to learning and knowledge, to the maturation of men in the teenagers they get every year, year in and year out. It is their function, their aim, their target and they cannot be derailed from this perspective. Oxford is their own territory and their own world and the world has no limits within these limits of Oxford, and an eventual trip to London for a lecture, but never beyond. C.S. Lewis is a special case in that entirely ghettoized intellectual world. He writes stories for children, for the children he will never have. These stories are about a strange world beyond the bottom of a wardrobe in the attic of his home. A world of bad and evil, of fighting for good and against evil. And yet his life is a routine that would kill thinking out of any human being. But not him, and plenty others around him. They are righteously living in the comfort of academia. The top echelon of that academia. Till one day when an American woman and her young child comes up and asks for an autograph. And the ghetto implodes. The peace is gone, love takes its place. The diplomatic marriage will eventually give way to a real marriage, but on a sick bed in a hospital. She finds out, too late of course, she has bone cancer and will eventually and soon die. And that's how C.S. Lewis discovers there is another love he had never really thought of and certainly not experienced: love for another human being that becomes your horizon and for whom you are dawn and dusk at the same time. That love that makes you mute and talkative in the same minute, so much the one and so much the other that your tongue trips on your muteness and your words get strangled in your talk. Love as a feeling of total gift of yourself to the other and of the other to yourself, with the tremendous responsibility that goes along with it. And death then becomes an unacceptable step away from this reality. Death comes and love will never go away and will turn into suffering, longing, wanting, needing and never getting the satisfaction you could ever wish to get. Love is for life I was going to say, oh yes, love is for life and even beyond life, for death if it comes and when it comes. Love never turns into ashes and never goes back to dirt because it is not dirt, it is the soul of the heart and the mind of life. And that's what C.S. Lewis actually discovers late in his life and never forgot after that. He finally learned how to be a fully blooming man, but it hurts so much when you learn love from within the death of your beloved. I must say the slow rhythm of the film, the very intimates scenes, the delicacy of the language and the acting, and the art of Anthony Hopkins serve that theme so well, so beautifully. It seems to be able to last for ever and ever, and yet the young son, now step-son, is there to remind you the show of life goes on for ever and ever on the stage of the strutting human beings we are.

    Richard Attenborough is a classy fellow who deserves to be recognized as a great film director. His more recent "Grey Owl" is brilliant! This film moves the heart like no other film I have ever witnessed! "Forrest Gump" gently touches the nerve endings. This film rams the gut! But what a classy production this is all the way through. A beautiful mellifluous script with tenderly rendered scenes of sensitive acting will have any audience in full approbation clamouring for more. I have said enough. You will cry in this one. Hopkins as a leading man makes C.S. Lewis human. This is a wonderful, tender, gentle-paced film that will stand the test of time! Mark my words! Own it today!

    Many years ago I read C.S. Lewis' wonderful book "A Grief Observed" - essentially his journal of his journey to rediscover his faith after the death from cancer of his wife Joy Gresham. I didn't deliberately steal the concept from Lewis, but perhaps he was at the back of my mind, since now, as a pastor, I often at funerals remind mourners that "grief is the price we pay for love." A concept similar to a central theme in both that book and this movie. This movie, which deals with the Lewis-Gresham relationship, surprised me in some ways. I had their relationship burned into my memory as a sudden and passionate thing, with Lewis being swept off his feet by this vivacious American divorc&eacute;e. Instead, we see here a picture of a very cautious relationship that develops slowly. Lewis, the lifelong bachelor, meets Gresham and is clearly taken with her, but always maintains a distance. Even when they marry, it's - in Lewis' words - only "technically," so that Joy can claim his British citizenship as her own. The romance - the open acknowledgement of love - comes only after her diagnosis, when Lewis is forced to confront the fact that she gives his life meaning, and that he can't imagine life without her, and they're married "properly" - by clergy, before God and without hiding the fact. Then, of course, there is the remission of her cancer, its return and her death, which forces Lewis to re-evaluate everything he believes about God, in the end, coming back to the realization that pain is a part of happiness, and that God is not to be blamed for Joy's death, but thanked for her life. Although the movie is spiritual, it's not in your face religious. It's a human movie; a sensitive movie - in the end, it's very moving. There's a lot of theological reflection that takes place on the relationship between suffering and faith, pain and happiness and how God fits into the picture, but there's nothing here that demands that one be a believer to enjoy this. It's fascinating to see the evolution of Lewis, who - by the sudden love he feels for Joy - has to change virtually everything about his life; perhaps best summed up by the bedroom scene, in which, on the first night they share a room together, Joy asks him what his routine is. He describes it, but then admits that he doesn't know what to do now that she's part of it. She says something like "you do everything you did before, then you just lie down - and I'm here." That exchange summed up both the gentleness of the movie and the challenge for Lewis of re-evaluating his entire life and everything he believed. C.S. Lewis is best known, of course, as an author of children's books. Fewer people realize that he was also quite an accomplished theologian. Regardless of how you think of him, though, he is a fascinating man, and while this movie is certainly gentle rather than exciting and romantic rather than passionate, it provides a fascinating glimpse of his spiritual journey. One also shouldn't overlook the excellent performances from Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger in the lead roles. 8/10

    I have truly loved the Narnia books by Clive Staples Lewis since I was 7. I have a memory of staying up late in bed, reading the last few chapters of "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" before seeing the movie the next day. Little did I know of C. S. Lewis' (Jack) personal life. He was a very reserved man as is shown here, and he doesn't have much of a life outside of teaching and writing. That is, until he meets Joy Gresham, an American woman living a hard life with her abusive husband and young son. Jack takes them in and for the first time, begins to love like he never thought he could. There is much more to this film than what meets the eye. It it is a story of compassion, love, loss, grief, and faith. As a Christian, it is wonderful to see a film with such deep and moral messages that revolve and even feel aimed, at me specifically. Anthony Hopkins does a magnificent job in portraying the famous and troubled writer. This is a movie worth watching again and again.

    I'm impressed with the volume of favorable reviews of this film. If you've gone this far, there's no reason at all for me to rehash the plot, the marvelous acting, or the directorial skills displayed here. If I may add something new to the reviews, I would like to say that it's a sad world where Anthony Hopkins is much more known for his portrayal of Hannibal Lechter in The Silence Of The Lambs franchise. I despised those movies, not because I don't like horrific flicks. Check out my other reviews if you think I'm a sob sister who just can't take it. But this is not a review of those films, so I'll proceed...What makes this film rise to greatness is it's portrayal of a man who thinks he has life, the universe, and everything, all wrapped up in a tidy intellectual package, and then finds himself doing and feeling things which force him to completely reevaluate the foundations of his life and faith. I can't help but think that there are many Christians who considered the subject of C. S. Lewis to be safe ground to venture through. Those who only know him through his Narnia stories, and the approval given for those films by their clergy, must have been quite surprised to find the man willing to break immigration laws to wed a somewhat bohemian woman for reasons of citizenship. I hope that those who first recoil at the truth of his life, grow as Lewis did as he faced the contradictions to his smug, self satisfied, view of himself and his faith. If you're a macho man who can't imagine himself capable of crying at a film, get ready to have the rug pulled out from under your pretension. This film hits notes of truth in sadness that are specifically male, and completely missing from 99.99% of cinematography. You will cry not because you are manipulated, but because you recognize yourself in this gentle intellectual facing the glory of love, the pain of unfair tragedy, and the responsibility that endures beyond the drama. Whoever you are, whatever you believe, watch this wonderful film. Share it with a loved one.

    Richard Attenboroughs best directorial piece. This is the true story about C.S.Lewis...an above average English novelist. The year is 1951 when he meets a fan( a U.S.A. lady) played by Debra Winger. Lewis gives us the very strong impression..that he does not know how to..."do it". Well there was no internet then..!! He tries a weak kiss...but it doesn't really work... Winger puts on an ..."&Iuml; know its very complex" act as she attempts to give reassurance. There is a huge stop sign for these fine people...and it says STOP. Winger develops terminal cancer..which is never a good sign......C.S.--- Decides to fall in love with this...USA....lady ...and marries her. It really is a fine film...even if the young kids wont get it. They will be looking for...Super--Heroes, or Will Ferrel. Is there a difference..???.....Both are not funny..... A good...movie,,,,,if you are over 32

    Movies don't always have to have an exciting premise. Sometimes a touching romance is not about two passionate young lovers but about an older couple finding each other long after their well-travelled youth. Shadowlands does not even have The African Queen's adventuresome setting, being set amid the quietness of 1950s Oxford. And yet it has on its side exceptional writing, deep humanity and good taste. Based by writer William Nicholson on an episode in the life of author C.S. Lewis, every scene is like a warm and meticulously sculpted syllabub, a little slice of human interaction that, whether joyful, angry or sad seems shot through with affection and universal truth. The picture benefits considerably from the sublime tranquillity of its lead man Anthony Hopkins. Blessed with such a piercing gaze, Hopkins has never needed to do anything ostentatious to hold our attention, but this is not to say his acting is simple. Shadowlands sees him moving in the depths of serene understatement, portraying a man not so much repressed as sparing in his emotional expression. When he does have a few outbursts towards the end of the movie, the effect hits us all the harder. On the other hand, Debra Winger seems to me a rather lazy choice for the role of Joy Gresham, since her most successful role prior to that had been in Terms of Endearment as another woman dying of cancer. She gives a decent account of herself though, showing us a woman with a hard exterior around a warm heart. Richard Attenborough has never been anything more than a mediocre director of drama or comedy or action, or anything. But he does have a few exceptional qualities, and one is the beauty with which he endows his work. There are several moments in Shadowlands, such as when Hopkins and Winger ascend a narrow staircase onto a tower top, or wend their way through the Herefordshire countryside, that something quietly breathtaking will slowly steal across the shot. Attenborough gives us a feeling of awe at landscapes and cityscapes without drawing too much obvious attention to them. Above all he directs with a slow subtlety that grants the picture its necessary dignity. One of the strangest things about it all was that when he helmed this movie he had just come back from playing a man with a bad Scots accent in Jurassic Park. Despite being all about the man, Shadowlands barely mentions the high fantasy of Lewis's Narnia novels for which he is best-known. The fact that he is famous for his work in fact seems entirely inconsequential to the story. Rather, it's the case that a handful of real events of his life have provided a story in themselves. This is a picture that is often profoundly moving in its normality.

    "Shadowlands" is possibly the most emotionally resonant, evocative film made in the 1990s, and it is amazing that this motion picture has not been available on region 1 DVD for many years. Anthony Hopkins plays the Oxford don well, though his Welsh-accented English would have been more accurate had it an Irish tinge instead. Debra Winger is an appealing choice for Joy Gresham, but her Brooklyn accent comes and goes, sometimes within a single scene. She could have used a language coach. Though much attention is paid to period detail (1952), it is jarring to see some post-Beatles moptops on several of Lewis' Oxford colleagues (Christopher Riley, marvellously played by John Wood, for one) and their scenes spoil the illusion somewhat. The film ends with a crisis of faith for C. S. Lewis after the death of his beloved Joy, which doubtless resonated with many viewers who have no particular convictions, but in truth Lewis' faith in Jesus Christ was renewed yet again. Lord Richard Attenborough did a fine job of direction, as did George Fenton with the film's score, and William Nicholson who adapted his own stage play. The resulting movie, whether intentional or not, shares some of the same ambiance as "Love Letters" and "Brief Encounter" (both filmed in 1945).

    I'm impressed with the volume of favorable reviews of this film. If you've gone this far, there's no reason at all for me to rehash the plot, the marvelous acting, or the directorial skills displayed here. If I may add something new to the reviews, I would like to say that it's a sad world where Anthony Hopkins is much more known for his portrayal of Hannibal Lechter in The Silence Of The Lambs franchise. I despised those movies, not because I don't like horrific flicks. Check out my other reviews if you think I'm a sob sister who just can't take it. But this is not a review of those films, so I'll proceed...What makes this film rise to greatness is it's portrayal of a man who thinks he has life, the universe, and everything, all wrapped up in a tidy intellectual package, and then finds himself doing and feeling things which force him to completely reevaluate the foundations of his life and faith. I can't help but think that there are many Christians who considered the subject of C. S. Lewis to be safe ground to venture through. Those who only know him through his Narnia stories, and the approval given for those films by their clergy, must have been quite surprised to find the man willing to break immigration laws to wed a somewhat bohemian woman for reasons of citizenship. I hope that those who first recoil at the truth of his life, grow as Lewis did as he faced the contradictions to his smug, self satisfied, view of himself and his faith. If you're a macho man who can't imagine himself capable of crying at a film, get ready to have the rug pulled out from under your pretension. This film hits notes of truth in sadness that are specifically male, and completely missing from 99.99% of cinematography. You will cry not because you are manipulated, but because you recognize yourself in this gentle intellectual facing the glory of love, the pain of unfair tragedy, and the responsibility that endures beyond the drama. Whoever you are, whatever you believe, watch this wonderful film. Share it with a loved one.

    Richard Attenboroughs best directorial piece. This is the true story about C.S.Lewis...an above average English novelist. The year is 1951 when he meets a fan( a U.S.A. lady) played by Debra Winger. Lewis gives us the very strong impression..that he does not know how to..."do it". Well there was no internet then..!! He tries a weak kiss...but it doesn't really work... Winger puts on an ..."&Iuml; know its very complex" act as she attempts to give reassurance. There is a huge stop sign for these fine people...and it says STOP. Winger develops terminal cancer..which is never a good sign......C.S.--- Decides to fall in love with this...USA....lady ...and marries her. It really is a fine film...even if the young kids wont get it. They will be looking for...Super--Heroes, or Will Ferrel. Is there a difference..???.....Both are not funny..... A good...movie,,,,,if you are over 32

    Movies don't always have to have an exciting premise. Sometimes a touching romance is not about two passionate young lovers but about an older couple finding each other long after their well-travelled youth. Shadowlands does not even have The African Queen's adventuresome setting, being set amid the quietness of 1950s Oxford. And yet it has on its side exceptional writing, deep humanity and good taste. Based by writer William Nicholson on an episode in the life of author C.S. Lewis, every scene is like a warm and meticulously sculpted syllabub, a little slice of human interaction that, whether joyful, angry or sad seems shot through with affection and universal truth. The picture benefits considerably from the sublime tranquillity of its lead man Anthony Hopkins. Blessed with such a piercing gaze, Hopkins has never needed to do anything ostentatious to hold our attention, but this is not to say his acting is simple. Shadowlands sees him moving in the depths of serene understatement, portraying a man not so much repressed as sparing in his emotional expression. When he does have a few outbursts towards the end of the movie, the effect hits us all the harder. On the other hand, Debra Winger seems to me a rather lazy choice for the role of Joy Gresham, since her most successful role prior to that had been in Terms of Endearment as another woman dying of cancer. She gives a decent account of herself though, showing us a woman with a hard exterior around a warm heart. Richard Attenborough has never been anything more than a mediocre director of drama or comedy or action, or anything. But he does have a few exceptional qualities, and one is the beauty with which he endows his work. There are several moments in Shadowlands, such as when Hopkins and Winger ascend a narrow staircase onto a tower top, or wend their way through the Herefordshire countryside, that something quietly breathtaking will slowly steal across the shot. Attenborough gives us a feeling of awe at landscapes and cityscapes without drawing too much obvious attention to them. Above all he directs with a slow subtlety that grants the picture its necessary dignity. One of the strangest things about it all was that when he helmed this movie he had just come back from playing a man with a bad Scots accent in Jurassic Park. Despite being all about the man, Shadowlands barely mentions the high fantasy of Lewis's Narnia novels for which he is best-known. The fact that he is famous for his work in fact seems entirely inconsequential to the story. Rather, it's the case that a handful of real events of his life have provided a story in themselves. This is a picture that is often profoundly moving in its normality.

    "Shadowlands" is possibly the most emotionally resonant, evocative film made in the 1990s, and it is amazing that this motion picture has not been available on region 1 DVD for many years. Anthony Hopkins plays the Oxford don well, though his Welsh-accented English would have been more accurate had it an Irish tinge instead. Debra Winger is an appealing choice for Joy Gresham, but her Brooklyn accent comes and goes, sometimes within a single scene. She could have used a language coach. Though much attention is paid to period detail (1952), it is jarring to see some post-Beatles moptops on several of Lewis' Oxford colleagues (Christopher Riley, marvellously played by John Wood, for one) and their scenes spoil the illusion somewhat. The film ends with a crisis of faith for C. S. Lewis after the death of his beloved Joy, which doubtless resonated with many viewers who have no particular convictions, but in truth Lewis' faith in Jesus Christ was renewed yet again. Lord Richard Attenborough did a fine job of direction, as did George Fenton with the film's score, and William Nicholson who adapted his own stage play. The resulting movie, whether intentional or not, shares some of the same ambiance as "Love Letters" and "Brief Encounter" (both filmed in 1945).

    Shadowlands is a wonderful movie, for so many reasons: the fact that it is about the author of the Narnia books (many people know nothing about him except for "Narnia"), the beautiful interiors and the academic, time-honoured atmosphere at the old university, philosophical thoughts, poetical language, the fact that Anthony Hopkins had the lead (everything with Antony Hopkins in it automatically becomes sublime!)... One wishes that one could have had a teacher like Lewis/Hopkins when one was young! :-) But best of all was the love story, of course. It was very romantic when the bogus marriage turned into real love, and the couple got married for real with a priest! This is of course a not uncommon theme in romantic movies - but this time it was about real people, and it had happened just like that in reality, which made the impact on the viewer even stronger! ...and it was of course even more tragic when Joy (the American wife) died, as love had come to C.S. Lewis so late in life... The reasons I give the movie "only" 9 stars instead of 10, are two. First, I did not find the American woman very sympathetic. It would have been much more fun with a nicer and more beautiful woman as Lewis'/Hopkins' great love... Of course it might be that she is portrayed accurately, but as the portrait of Lewis is also romanticized (he was not as handsome or charming as Hopkins! :-) ), the filmmakers could have used their poetical license to make the wife a more lovable character as well! The other reason is that I found the movie just a little too slow and long. It would have been a great improvement if they had shortened the slow parts with 10-15 minutes all in all.

    Immensely moving, with a stunning, complex performance by Anthony Hopkins, and a very good one by Debra Winger as his slow developing love. Yes, it's corny in a few moments, obvious in a few others, but overall this is a highly intelligent, thoughtful, subtle look at damaged adults reaching for love and dealing with loss. By far my favorite of Attenborough's films. A 'tearjerker', but elevated way beyond that by the writing, direction and acting, into a profound examination of the way we need love to lift us up, while that very thing makes us so vulnerable. Ironically, while this may be the strongest of Attenborough's films, with a stellar cast, great reviews, a fascinating main character (The novelist C.S. Lewis), and powerful universal emotions, it has long been unavailable on DVD. It seems almost a forgotten film, which is everyone's loss.

    This is a very strange film, a most extraordinary film. C.S. Lewis and his brother are two unmarried professors in Oxford, living together in the same house. They are living in this haven of peace that Oxford is, entirely dedicated to learning and knowledge, to the maturation of men in the teenagers they get every year, year in and year out. It is their function, their aim, their target and they cannot be derailed from this perspective. Oxford is their own territory and their own world and the world has no limits within these limits of Oxford, and an eventual trip to London for a lecture, but never beyond. C.S. Lewis is a special case in that entirely ghettoized intellectual world. He writes stories for children, for the children he will never have. These stories are about a strange world beyond the bottom of a wardrobe in the attic of his home. A world of bad and evil, of fighting for good and against evil. And yet his life is a routine that would kill thinking out of any human being. But not him, and plenty others around him. They are righteously living in the comfort of academia. The top echelon of that academia. Till one day when an American woman and her young child comes up and asks for an autograph. And the ghetto implodes. The peace is gone, love takes its place. The diplomatic marriage will eventually give way to a real marriage, but on a sick bed in a hospital. She finds out, too late of course, she has bone cancer and will eventually and soon die. And that's how C.S. Lewis discovers there is another love he had never really thought of and certainly not experienced: love for another human being that becomes your horizon and for whom you are dawn and dusk at the same time. That love that makes you mute and talkative in the same minute, so much the one and so much the other that your tongue trips on your muteness and your words get strangled in your talk. Love as a feeling of total gift of yourself to the other and of the other to yourself, with the tremendous responsibility that goes along with it. And death then becomes an unacceptable step away from this reality. Death comes and love will never go away and will turn into suffering, longing, wanting, needing and never getting the satisfaction you could ever wish to get. Love is for life I was going to say, oh yes, love is for life and even beyond life, for death if it comes and when it comes. Love never turns into ashes and never goes back to dirt because it is not dirt, it is the soul of the heart and the mind of life. And that's what C.S. Lewis actually discovers late in his life and never forgot after that. He finally learned how to be a fully blooming man, but it hurts so much when you learn love from within the death of your beloved. I must say the slow rhythm of the film, the very intimates scenes, the delicacy of the language and the acting, and the art of Anthony Hopkins serve that theme so well, so beautifully. It seems to be able to last for ever and ever, and yet the young son, now step-son, is there to remind you the show of life goes on for ever and ever on the stage of the strutting human beings we are.

    Richard Attenborough is a classy fellow who deserves to be recognized as a great film director. His more recent "Grey Owl" is brilliant! This film moves the heart like no other film I have ever witnessed! "Forrest Gump" gently touches the nerve endings. This film rams the gut! But what a classy production this is all the way through. A beautiful mellifluous script with tenderly rendered scenes of sensitive acting will have any audience in full approbation clamouring for more. I have said enough. You will cry in this one. Hopkins as a leading man makes C.S. Lewis human. This is a wonderful, tender, gentle-paced film that will stand the test of time! Mark my words! Own it today!

    Many years ago I read C.S. Lewis' wonderful book "A Grief Observed" - essentially his journal of his journey to rediscover his faith after the death from cancer of his wife Joy Gresham. I didn't deliberately steal the concept from Lewis, but perhaps he was at the back of my mind, since now, as a pastor, I often at funerals remind mourners that "grief is the price we pay for love." A concept similar to a central theme in both that book and this movie. This movie, which deals with the Lewis-Gresham relationship, surprised me in some ways. I had their relationship burned into my memory as a sudden and passionate thing, with Lewis being swept off his feet by this vivacious American divorc&eacute;e. Instead, we see here a picture of a very cautious relationship that develops slowly. Lewis, the lifelong bachelor, meets Gresham and is clearly taken with her, but always maintains a distance. Even when they marry, it's - in Lewis' words - only "technically," so that Joy can claim his British citizenship as her own. The romance - the open acknowledgement of love - comes only after her diagnosis, when Lewis is forced to confront the fact that she gives his life meaning, and that he can't imagine life without her, and they're married "properly" - by clergy, before God and without hiding the fact. Then, of course, there is the remission of her cancer, its return and her death, which forces Lewis to re-evaluate everything he believes about God, in the end, coming back to the realization that pain is a part of happiness, and that God is not to be blamed for Joy's death, but thanked for her life. Although the movie is spiritual, it's not in your face religious. It's a human movie; a sensitive movie - in the end, it's very moving. There's a lot of theological reflection that takes place on the relationship between suffering and faith, pain and happiness and how God fits into the picture, but there's nothing here that demands that one be a believer to enjoy this. It's fascinating to see the evolution of Lewis, who - by the sudden love he feels for Joy - has to change virtually everything about his life; perhaps best summed up by the bedroom scene, in which, on the first night they share a room together, Joy asks him what his routine is. He describes it, but then admits that he doesn't know what to do now that she's part of it. She says something like "you do everything you did before, then you just lie down - and I'm here." That exchange summed up both the gentleness of the movie and the challenge for Lewis of re-evaluating his entire life and everything he believed. C.S. Lewis is best known, of course, as an author of children's books. Fewer people realize that he was also quite an accomplished theologian. Regardless of how you think of him, though, he is a fascinating man, and while this movie is certainly gentle rather than exciting and romantic rather than passionate, it provides a fascinating glimpse of his spiritual journey. One also shouldn't overlook the excellent performances from Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger in the lead roles. 8/10

    I have truly loved the Narnia books by Clive Staples Lewis since I was 7. I have a memory of staying up late in bed, reading the last few chapters of "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" before seeing the movie the next day. Little did I know of C. S. Lewis' (Jack) personal life. He was a very reserved man as is shown here, and he doesn't have much of a life outside of teaching and writing. That is, until he meets Joy Gresham, an American woman living a hard life with her abusive husband and young son. Jack takes them in and for the first time, begins to love like he never thought he could. There is much more to this film than what meets the eye. It it is a story of compassion, love, loss, grief, and faith. As a Christian, it is wonderful to see a film with such deep and moral messages that revolve and even feel aimed, at me specifically. Anthony Hopkins does a magnificent job in portraying the famous and troubled writer. This is a movie worth watching again and again.

These stories are about a strange world beyond the bottom of a wardrobe in the attic of his home. A world of bad and evil, of fighting for good and against evil. And yet his life is a routine that would kill thinking out of any human being. But not him, and plenty others around him. They are righteously living in the comfort of academia. The top echelon of that academia. Till one day when an American woman and her young child comes up and asks for an autograph. And the ghetto implodes. The peace is gone, love takes its place. The diplomatic marriage will eventually give way to a real marriage, but on a sick bed in a hospital. She finds out, too late of course, she has bone cancer and will eventually and soon die. And that's how C.S. Lewis discovers there is another love he had never really thought of and certainly not experienced: love for another human being that becomes your horizon and for whom you are dawn and dusk at the same time. That love that makes you mute and talkative in the same minute, so much the one and so much the other that your tongue trips on your muteness and your words get strangled in your talk. Love as a feeling of total gift of yourself to the other and of the other to yourself, with the tremendous responsibility that goes along with it. And death then becomes an unacceptable step away from this reality. Death comes and love will never go away and will turn into suffering, longing, wanting, needing and never getting the satisfaction you could ever wish to get. Love is for life I was going to say, oh yes, love is for life and even beyond life, for death if it comes and when it comes. Love never turns into ashes and never goes back to dirt because it is not dirt, it is the soul of the heart and the mind of life. And that's what C.S. Lewis actually discovers late in his life and never forgot after that. He finally learned how to be a fully blooming man, but it hurts so much when you learn love from within the death of your beloved. I must say the slow rhythm of the film, the very intimates scenes, the delicacy of the language and the acting, and the art of Anthony Hopkins serve that theme so well, so beautifully. It seems to be able to last for ever and ever, and yet the young son, now step-son, is there to remind you the show of life goes on for ever and ever on the stage of the strutting human beings we are.

    Richard Attenborough is a classy fellow who deserves to be recognized as a great film director. His more recent "Grey Owl" is brilliant! This film moves the heart like no other film I have ever witnessed! "Forrest Gump" gently touches the nerve endings. This film rams the gut! But what a classy production this is all the way through. A beautiful mellifluous script with tenderly rendered scenes of sensitive acting will have any audience in full approbation clamouring for more. I have said enough. You will cry in this one. Hopkins as a leading man makes C.S. Lewis human. This is a wonderful, tender, gentle-paced film that will stand the test of time! Mark my words! Own it today!

    Many years ago I read C.S. Lewis' wonderful book "A Grief Observed" - essentially his journal of his journey to rediscover his faith after the death from cancer of his wife Joy Gresham. I didn't deliberately steal the concept from Lewis, but perhaps he was at the back of my mind, since now, as a pastor, I often at funerals remind mourners that "grief is the price we pay for love." A concept similar to a central theme in both that book and this movie. This movie, which deals with the Lewis-Gresham relationship, surprised me in some ways. I had their relationship burned into my memory as a sudden and passionate thing, with Lewis being swept off his feet by this vivacious American divorc&eacute;e. Instead, we see here a picture of a very cautious relationship that develops slowly. Lewis, the lifelong bachelor, meets Gresham and is clearly taken with her, but always maintains a distance. Even when they marry, it's - in Lewis' words - only "technically," so that Joy can claim his British citizenship as her own. The romance - the open acknowledgement of love - comes only after her diagnosis, when Lewis is forced to confront the fact that she gives his life meaning, and that he can't imagine life without her, and they're married "properly" - by clergy, before God and without hiding the fact. Then, of course, there is the remission of her cancer, its return and her death, which forces Lewis to re-evaluate everything he believes about God, in the end, coming back to the realization that pain is a part of happiness, and that God is not to be blamed for Joy's death, but thanked for her life. Although the movie is spiritual, it's not in your face religious. It's a human movie; a sensitive movie - in the end, it's very moving. There's a lot of theological reflection that takes place on the relationship between suffering and faith, pain and happiness and how God fits into the picture, but there's nothing here that demands that one be a believer to enjoy this. It's fascinating to see the evolution of Lewis, who - by the sudden love he feels for Joy - has to change virtually everything about his life; perhaps best summed up by the bedroom scene, in which, on the first night they share a room together, Joy asks him what his routine is. He describes it, but then admits that he doesn't know what to do now that she's part of it. She says something like "you do everything you did before, then you just lie down - and I'm here." That exchange summed up both the gentleness of the movie and the challenge for Lewis of re-evaluating his entire life and everything he believed. C.S. Lewis is best known, of course, as an author of children's books. Fewer people realize that he was also quite an accomplished theologian. Regardless of how you think of him, though, he is a fascinating man, and while this movie is certainly gentle rather than exciting and romantic rather than passionate, it provides a fascinating glimpse of his spiritual journey. One also shouldn't overlook the excellent performances from Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger in the lead roles. 8/10

    I have truly loved the Narnia books by Clive Staples Lewis since I was 7. I have a memory of staying up late in bed, reading the last few chapters of "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" before seeing the movie the next day. Little did I know of C. S. Lewis' (Jack) personal life. He was a very reserved man as is shown here, and he doesn't have much of a life outside of teaching and writing. That is, until he meets Joy Gresham, an American woman living a hard life with her abusive husband and young son. Jack takes them in and for the first time, begins to love like he never thought he could. There is much more to this film than what meets the eye. It it is a story of compassion, love, loss, grief, and faith. As a Christian, it is wonderful to see a film with such deep and moral messages that revolve and even feel aimed, at me specifically. Anthony Hopkins does a magnificent job in portraying the famous and troubled writer. This is a movie worth watching again and again.

    I'm impressed with the volume of favorable reviews of this film. If you've gone this far, there's no reason at all for me to rehash the plot, the marvelous acting, or the directorial skills displayed here. If I may add something new to the reviews, I would like to say that it's a sad world where Anthony Hopkins is much more known for his portrayal of Hannibal Lechter in The Silence Of The Lambs franchise. I despised those movies, not because I don't like horrific flicks. Check out my other reviews if you think I'm a sob sister who just can't take it. But this is not a review of those films, so I'll proceed...What makes this film rise to greatness is it's portrayal of a man who thinks he has life, the universe, and everything, all wrapped up in a tidy intellectual package, and then finds himself doing and feeling things which force him to completely reevaluate the foundations of his life and faith. I can't help but think that there are many Christians who considered the subject of C. S. Lewis to be safe ground to venture through. Those who only know him through his Narnia stories, and the approval given for those films by their clergy, must have been quite surprised to find the man willing to break immigration laws to wed a somewhat bohemian woman for reasons of citizenship. I hope that those who first recoil at the truth of his life, grow as Lewis did as he faced the contradictions to his smug, self satisfied, view of himself and his faith. If you're a macho man who can't imagine himself capable of crying at a film, get ready to have the rug pulled out from under your pretension. This film hits notes of truth in sadness that are specifically male, and completely missing from 99.99% of cinematography. You will cry not because you are manipulated, but because you recognize yourself in this gentle intellectual facing the glory of love, the pain of unfair tragedy, and the responsibility that endures beyond the drama. Whoever you are, whatever you believe, watch this wonderful film. Share it with a loved one.

    Richard Attenboroughs best directorial piece. This is the true story about C.S.Lewis...an above average English novelist. The year is 1951 when he meets a fan( a U.S.A. lady) played by Debra Winger. Lewis gives us the very strong impression..that he does not know how to..."do it". Well there was no internet then..!! He tries a weak kiss...but it doesn't really work... Winger puts on an ..."&Iuml; know its very complex" act as she attempts to give reassurance. There is a huge stop sign for these fine people...and it says STOP. Winger develops terminal cancer..which is never a good sign......C.S.--- Decides to fall in love with this...USA....lady ...and marries her. It really is a fine film...even if the young kids wont get it. They will be looking for...Super--Heroes, or Will Ferrel. Is there a difference..???.....Both are not funny.....

    Movies don't always have to have an exciting premise. Sometimes a touching romance is not about two passionate young lovers but about an older couple finding each other long after their well-travelled youth. Shadowlands does not even have The African Queen's adventuresome setting, being set amid the quietness of 1950s Oxford. And yet it has on its side exceptional writing, deep humanity and good taste. Based by writer William Nicholson on an episode in the life of author C.S. Lewis, every scene is like a warm and meticulously sculpted syllabub, a little slice of human interaction that, whether joyful, angry or sad seems shot through with affection and universal truth. The picture benefits considerably from the sublime tranquillity of its lead man Anthony Hopkins. Blessed with such a piercing gaze, Hopkins has never needed to do anything ostentatious to hold our attention, but this is not to say his acting is simple. Shadowlands sees him moving in the depths of serene understatement, portraying a man not so much repressed as sparing in his emotional expression. When he does have a few outbursts towards the end of the movie, the effect hits us all the harder. On the other hand, Debra Winger seems to me a rather lazy choice for the role of Joy Gresham, since her most successful role prior to that had been in Terms of Endearment as another woman dying of cancer. She gives a decent account of herself though, showing us a woman with a hard exterior around a warm heart. Richard Attenborough has never been anything more than a mediocre director of drama or comedy or action, or anything. But he does have a few exceptional qualities, and one is the beauty with which he endows his work. There are several moments in Shadowlands, such as when Hopkins and Winger ascend a narrow staircase onto a tower top, or wend their way through the Herefordshire countryside, that something quietly breathtaking will slowly steal across the shot. Attenborough gives us a feeling of awe at landscapes and cityscapes without drawing too much obvious attention to them. Above all he directs with a slow subtlety that grants the picture its necessary dignity. One of the strangest things about it all was that when he helmed this movie he had just come back from playing a man with a bad Scots accent in Jurassic Park. Despite being all about the man, Shadowlands barely mentions the high fantasy of Lewis's Narnia novels for which he is best-known. The fact that he is famous for his work in fact seems entirely inconsequential to the story. Rather, it's the case that a handful of real events of his life have provided a story in themselves. This is a picture that is often profoundly moving in its normality.

    "Shadowlands" is possibly the most emotionally resonant, evocative film made in the 1990s, and it is amazing that this motion picture has not been available on region 1 DVD for many years. Anthony Hopkins plays the Oxford don well, though his Welsh-accented English would have been more accurate had it an Irish tinge instead. Debra Winger is an appealing choice for Joy Gresham, but her Brooklyn accent comes and goes, sometimes within a single scene. She could have used a language coach. Though much attention is paid to period detail (1952), it is jarring to see some post-Beatles moptops on several of Lewis' Oxford colleagues (Christopher Riley, marvellously played by John Wood, for one) and their scenes spoil the illusion somewhat. The film ends with a crisis of faith for C. S. Lewis after the death of his beloved Joy, which doubtless resonated with many viewers who have no particular convictions, but in truth Lewis' faith in Jesus Christ was renewed yet again. Lord Richard Attenborough did a fine job of direction, as did George Fenton with the film's score, and William Nicholson who adapted his own stage play. The resulting movie, whether intentional or not, shares some of the same ambiance as "Love Letters" and "Brief Encounter" (both filmed in 1945).

    Shadowlands is a wonderful movie, for so many reasons: the fact that it is about the author of the Narnia books (many people know nothing about him except for "Narnia"), the beautiful interiors and the academic, time-honoured atmosphere at the old university, philosophical thoughts, poetical language, the fact that Anthony Hopkins had the lead (everything with Antony Hopkins in it automatically becomes sublime!)... One wishes that one could have had a teacher like Lewis/Hopkins when one was young! :-) But best of all was the love story, of course. It was very romantic when the bogus marriage turned into real love, and the couple got married for real with a priest! This is of course a not uncommon theme in romantic movies - but this time it was about real people, and it had happened just like that in reality, which made the impact on the viewer even stronger! ...and it was of course even more tragic when Joy (the American wife) died, as love had come to C.S. Lewis so late in life... The reasons I give the movie "only" 9 stars instead of 10, are two. First, I did not find the American woman very sympathetic. It would have been much more fun with a nicer and more beautiful woman as Lewis'/Hopkins' great love... Of course it might be that she is portrayed accurately, but as the portrait of Lewis is also romanticized (he was not as handsome or charming as Hopkins! :-) ), the filmmakers could have used their poetical license to make the wife a more lovable character as well! The other reason is that I found the movie just a little too slow and long. It would have been a great improvement if they had shortened the slow parts with 10-15 minutes all in all.

    Immensely moving, with a stunning, complex performance by Anthony Hopkins, and a very good one by Debra Winger as his slow developing love. Yes, it's corny in a few moments, obvious in a few others, but overall this is a highly intelligent, thoughtful, subtle look at damaged adults reaching for love and dealing with loss. By far my favorite of Attenborough's films. A 'tearjerker', but elevated way beyond that by the writing, direction and acting, into a profound examination of the way we need love to lift us up, while that very thing makes us so vulnerable. Ironically, while this may be the strongest of Attenborough's films, with a stellar cast, great reviews, a fascinating main character (The novelist C.S. Lewis), and powerful universal emotions, it has long been unavailable on DVD. It seems almost a forgotten film, which is everyone's loss.

    This is a very strange film, a most extraordinary film. C.S. Lewis and his brother are two unmarried professors in Oxford, living together in the same house. They are living in this haven of peace that Oxford is, entirely dedicated to learning and knowledge, to the maturation of men in the teenagers they get every year, year in and year out. It is their function, their aim, their target and they cannot be derailed from this perspective. Oxford is their own territory and their own world and the world has no limits within these limits of Oxford, and an eventual trip to London for a lecture, but never beyond. C.S. Lewis is a special case in that entirely ghettoized intellectual world. He writes stories for children, for the children he will never have. These stories are about a strange world beyond the bottom of a wardrobe in the attic of his home. A world of bad and evil, of fighting for good and against evil. And yet his life is a routine that would kill thinking out of any human being. But not him, and plenty others around him. They are righteously living in the comfort of academia. The top echelon of that academia. Till one day when an American woman and her young child comes up and asks for an autograph. And the ghetto implodes. The peace is gone, love takes its place. The diplomatic marriage will eventually give way to a real marriage, but on a sick bed in a hospital. She finds out, too late of course, she has bone cancer and will eventually and soon die. And that's how C.S. Lewis discovers there is another love he had never really thought of and certainly not experienced: love for another human being that becomes your horizon and for whom you are dawn and dusk at the same time. That love that makes you mute and talkative in the same minute, so much the one and so much the other that your tongue trips on your muteness and your words get strangled in your talk. Love as a feeling of total gift of yourself to the other and of the other to yourself, with the tremendous responsibility that goes along with it. And death then becomes an unacceptable step away from this reality. Death comes and love will never go away and will turn into suffering, longing, wanting, needing and never getting the satisfaction you could ever wish to get.

    Movies don't always have to have an exciting premise. Sometimes a touching romance is not about two passionate young lovers but about an older couple finding each other long after their well-travelled youth. Shadowlands does not even have The African Queen's adventuresome setting, being set amid the quietness of 1950s Oxford. And yet it has on its side exceptional writing, deep humanity and good taste. Based by writer William Nicholson on an episode in the life of author C.S. Lewis, every scene is like a warm and meticulously sculpted syllabub, a little slice of human interaction that, whether joyful, angry or sad seems shot through with affection and universal truth. The picture benefits considerably from the sublime tranquillity of its lead man Anthony Hopkins. Blessed with such a piercing gaze, Hopkins has never needed to do anything ostentatious to hold our attention, but this is not to say his acting is simple. Shadowlands sees him moving in the depths of serene understatement, portraying a man not so much repressed as sparing in his emotional expression. When he does have a few outbursts towards the end of the movie, the effect hits us all the harder. On the other hand, Debra Winger seems to me a rather lazy choice for the role of Joy Gresham, since her most successful role prior to that had been in Terms of Endearment as another woman dying of cancer. She gives a decent account of herself though, showing us a woman with a hard exterior around a warm heart. Richard Attenborough has never been anything more than a mediocre director of drama or comedy or action, or anything. But he does have a few exceptional qualities, and one is the beauty with which he endows his work. There are several moments in Shadowlands, such as when Hopkins and Winger ascend a narrow staircase onto a tower top, or wend their way through the Herefordshire countryside, that something quietly breathtaking will slowly steal across the shot. Attenborough gives us a feeling of awe at landscapes and cityscapes without drawing too much obvious attention to them. Above all he directs with a slow subtlety that grants the picture its necessary dignity. One of the strangest things about it all was that when he helmed this movie he had just come back from playing a man with a bad Scots accent in Jurassic Park. Despite being all about the man, Shadowlands barely mentions the high fantasy of Lewis's Narnia novels for which he is best-known. The fact that he is famous for his work in fact seems entirely inconsequential to the story. Rather, it's the case that a handful of real events of his life have provided a story in themselves. This is a picture that is often profoundly moving in its normality.

    "Shadowlands" is possibly the most emotionally resonant, evocative film made in the 1990s, and it is amazing that this motion picture has not been available on region 1 DVD for many years. Anthony Hopkins plays the Oxford don well, though his Welsh-accented English would have been more accurate had it an Irish tinge instead. Debra Winger is an appealing choice for Joy Gresham, but her Brooklyn accent comes and goes, sometimes within a single scene. She could have used a language coach. Though much attention is paid to period detail (1952), it is jarring to see some post-Beatles moptops on several of Lewis' Oxford colleagues (Christopher Riley, marvellously played by John Wood, for one) and their scenes spoil the illusion somewhat. The film ends with a crisis of faith for C. S. Lewis after the death of his beloved Joy, which doubtless resonated with many viewers who have no particular convictions, but in truth Lewis' faith in Jesus Christ was renewed yet again. Lord Richard Attenborough did a fine job of direction, as did George Fenton with the film's score, and William Nicholson who adapted his own stage play. The resulting movie, whether intentional or not, shares some of the same ambiance as "Love Letters" and "Brief Encounter" (both filmed in 1945).

    Shadowlands is a wonderful movie, for so many reasons: the fact that it is about the author of the Narnia books (many people know nothing about him except for "Narnia"), the beautiful interiors and the academic, time-honoured atmosphere at the old university, philosophical thoughts, poetical language, the fact that Anthony Hopkins had the lead (everything with Antony Hopkins in it automatically becomes sublime!)... One wishes that one could have had a teacher like Lewis/Hopkins when one was young! :-) But best of all was the love story, of course. It was very romantic when the bogus marriage turned into real love, and the couple got married for real with a priest! This is of course a not uncommon theme in romantic movies - but this time it was about real people, and it had happened just like that in reality, which made the impact on the viewer even stronger! ...and it was of course even more tragic when Joy (the American wife) died, as love had come to C.S. Lewis so late in life... The reasons I give the movie "only" 9 stars instead of 10, are two. First, I did not find the American woman very sympathetic. It would have been much more fun with a nicer and more beautiful woman as Lewis'/Hopkins' great love... Of course it might be that she is portrayed accurately, but as the portrait of Lewis is also romanticized (he was not as handsome or charming as Hopkins! :-) ), the filmmakers could have used their poetical license to make the wife a more lovable character as well! The other reason is that I found the movie just a little too slow and long. It would have been a great improvement if they had shortened the slow parts with 10-15 minutes all in all.

    Immensely moving, with a stunning, complex performance by Anthony Hopkins, and a very good one by Debra Winger as his slow developing love. Yes, it's corny in a few moments, obvious in a few others, but overall this is a highly intelligent, thoughtful, subtle look at damaged adults reaching for love and dealing with loss. By far my favorite of Attenborough's films. A 'tearjerker', but elevated way beyond that by the writing, direction and acting, into a profound examination of the way we need love to lift us up, while that very thing makes us so vulnerable. Ironically, while this may be the strongest of Attenborough's films, with a stellar cast, great reviews, a fascinating main character (The novelist C.S. Lewis), and powerful universal emotions, it has long been unavailable on DVD. It seems almost a forgotten film, which is everyone's loss.

    This is a very strange film, a most extraordinary film. C.S. Lewis and his brother are two unmarried professors in Oxford, living together in the same house. They are living in this haven of peace that Oxford is, entirely dedicated to learning and knowledge, to the maturation of men in the teenagers they get every year, year in and year out. It is their function, their aim, their target and they cannot be derailed from this perspective. Oxford is their own territory and their own world and the world has no limits within these limits of Oxford, and an eventual trip to London for a lecture, but never beyond. C.S. Lewis is a special case in that entirely ghettoized intellectual world. He writes stories for children, for the children he will never have. These stories are about a strange world beyond the bottom of a wardrobe in the attic of his home. A world of bad and evil, of fighting for good and against evil. And yet his life is a routine that would kill thinking out of any human being. But not him, and plenty others around him. They are righteously living in the comfort of academia. The top echelon of that academia. Till one day when an American woman and her young child comes up and asks for an autograph. And the ghetto implodes. The peace is gone, love takes its place. The diplomatic marriage will eventually give way to a real marriage, but on a sick bed in a hospital. She finds out, too late of course, she has bone cancer and will eventually and soon die. And that's how C.S. Lewis discovers there is another love he had never really thought of and certainly not experienced: love for another human being that becomes your horizon and for whom you are dawn and dusk at the same time. That love that makes you mute and talkative in the same minute, so much the one and so much the other that your tongue trips on your muteness and your words get strangled in your talk. Love as a feeling of total gift of yourself to the other and of the other to yourself, with the tremendous responsibility that goes along with it. And death then becomes an unacceptable step away from this reality. Death comes and love will never go away and will turn into suffering, longing, wanting, needing and never getting the satisfaction you could ever wish to get. Love is for life I was going to say, oh yes, love is for life and even beyond life, for death if it comes and when it comes. Love never turns into ashes and never goes back to dirt because it is not dirt, it is the soul of the heart and the mind of life. And that's what C.S. Lewis actually discovers late in his life and never forgot after that. He finally learned how to be a fully blooming man, but it hurts so much when you learn love from within the death of your beloved. I must say the slow rhythm of the film, the very intimates scenes, the delicacy of the language and the acting, and the art of Anthony Hopkins serve that theme so well, so beautifully. It seems to be able to last for ever and ever, and yet the young son, now step-son, is there to remind you the show of life goes on for ever and ever on the stage of the strutting human beings we are.

    Richard Attenborough is a classy fellow who deserves to be recognized as a great film director. His more recent "Grey Owl" is brilliant! This film moves the heart like no other film I have ever witnessed! "Forrest Gump" gently touches the nerve endings. This film rams the gut! But what a classy production this is all the way through. A beautiful mellifluous script with tenderly rendered scenes of sensitive acting will have any audience in full approbation clamouring for more. I have said enough. You will cry in this one. Hopkins as a leading man makes C.S. Lewis human. This is a wonderful, tender, gentle-paced film that will stand the test of time! Mark my words! Own it today!

    Many years ago I read C.S. Lewis' wonderful book "A Grief Observed" - essentially his journal of his journey to rediscover his faith after the death from cancer of his wife Joy Gresham. I didn't deliberately steal the concept from Lewis, but perhaps he was at the back of my mind, since now, as a pastor, I often at funerals remind mourners that "grief is the price we pay for love." A concept similar to a central theme in both that book and this movie. This movie, which deals with the Lewis-Gresham relationship, surprised me in some ways. I had their relationship burned into my memory as a sudden and passionate thing, with Lewis being swept off his feet by this vivacious American divorc&eacute;e. Instead, we see here a picture of a very cautious relationship that develops slowly. Lewis, the lifelong bachelor, meets Gresham and is clearly taken with her, but always maintains a distance. Even when they marry, it's - in Lewis' words - only "technically," so that Joy can claim his British citizenship as her own. The romance - the open acknowledgement of love - comes only after her diagnosis, when Lewis is forced to confront the fact that she gives his life meaning, and that he can't imagine life without her, and they're married "properly" - by clergy, before God and without hiding the fact. Then, of course, there is the remission of her cancer, its return and her death, which forces Lewis to re-evaluate everything he believes about God, in the end, coming back to the realization that pain is a part of happiness, and that God is not to be blamed for Joy's death, but thanked for her life. Although the movie is spiritual, it's not in your face religious. It's a human movie; a sensitive movie - in the end, it's very moving. There's a lot of theological reflection that takes place on the relationship between suffering and faith, pain and happiness and how God fits into the picture, but there's nothing here that demands that one be a believer to enjoy this. It's fascinating to see the evolution of Lewis, who - by the sudden love he feels for Joy - has to change virtually everything about his life; perhaps best summed up by the bedroom scene, in which, on the first night they share a room together, Joy asks him what his routine is. He describes it, but then admits that he doesn't know what to do now that she's part of it. She says something like "you do everything you did before, then you just lie down - and I'm here." That exchange summed up both the gentleness of the movie and the challenge for Lewis of re-evaluating his entire life and everything he believed. C.S. Lewis is best known, of course, as an author of children's books. Fewer people realize that he was also quite an accomplished theologian. Regardless of how you think of him, though, he is a fascinating man, and while this movie is certainly gentle rather than exciting and romantic rather than passionate, it provides a fascinating glimpse of his spiritual journey. One also shouldn't overlook the excellent performances from Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger in the lead roles. 8/10

    I have truly loved the Narnia books by Clive Staples Lewis since I was 7. I have a memory of staying up late in bed, reading the last few chapters of "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" before seeing the movie the next day. Little did I know of C. S. Lewis' (Jack) personal life. He was a very reserved man as is shown here, and he doesn't have much of a life outside of teaching and writing. That is, until he meets Joy Gresham, an American woman living a hard life with her abusive husband and young son. Jack takes them in and for the first time, begins to love like he never thought he could. There is much more to this film than what meets the eye. It it is a story of compassion, love, loss, grief, and faith. As a Christian, it is wonderful to see a film with such deep and moral messages that revolve and even feel aimed, at me specifically. Anthony Hopkins does a magnificent job in portraying the famous and troubled writer. This is a movie worth watching again and again.

    I'm impressed with the volume of favorable reviews of this film. If you've gone this far, there's no reason at all for me to rehash the plot, the marvelous acting, or the directorial skills displayed here. If I may add something new to the reviews, I would like to say that it's a sad world where Anthony Hopkins is much more known for his portrayal of Hannibal Lechter in The Silence Of The Lambs franchise. I despised those movies, not because I don't like horrific flicks. Check out my other reviews if you think I'm a sob sister who just can't take it. But this is not a review of those films, so I'll proceed...What makes this film rise to greatness is it's portrayal of a man who thinks he has life, the universe, and everything, all wrapped up in a tidy intellectual package, and then finds himself doing and feeling things which force him to completely reevaluate the foundations of his life and faith. I can't help but think that there are many Christians who considered the subject of C. S. Lewis to be safe ground to venture through. Those who only know him through his Narnia stories, and the approval given for those films by their clergy, must have been quite surprised to find the man willing to break immigration laws to wed a somewhat bohemian woman for reasons of citizenship. I hope that those who first recoil at the truth of his life, grow as Lewis did as he faced the contradictions to his smug, self satisfied, view of himself and his faith. If you're a macho man who can't imagine himself capable of crying at a film, get ready to have the rug pulled out from under your pretension. This film hits notes of truth in sadness that are specifically male, and completely missing from 99.99% of cinematography. You will cry not because you are manipulated, but because you recognize yourself in this gentle intellectual facing the glory of love, the pain of unfair tragedy, and the responsibility that endures beyond the drama. Whoever you are, whatever you believe, watch this wonderful film. Share it with a loved one.

    Richard Attenboroughs best directorial piece. This is the true story about C.S.Lewis...an above average English novelist. The year is 1951 when he meets a fan( a U.S.A. lady) played by Debra Winger. Lewis gives us the very strong impression..that he does not know how to..."do it". Well there was no internet then..!! He tries a weak kiss...but it doesn't really work... Winger puts on an ..."&Iuml; know its very complex" act as she attempts to give reassurance. There is a huge stop sign for these fine people...and it says STOP. Winger develops terminal cancer..which is never a good sign......C.S.--- Decides to fall in love with this...USA....lady ...and marries her. It really is a fine film...even if the young kids wont get it. They will be looking for...Super--Heroes, or Will Ferrel. Is there a difference..???.....Both are not funny..... A good...movie,,,,,if you are over 32

    Many years ago I read C.S. Lewis' wonderful book "A Grief Observed" - essentially his journal of his journey to rediscover his faith after the death from cancer of his wife Joy Gresham. I didn't deliberately steal the concept from Lewis, but perhaps he was at the back of my mind, since now, as a pastor, I often at funerals remind mourners that "grief is the price we pay for love." A concept similar to a central theme in both that book and this movie. This movie, which deals with the Lewis-Gresham relationship, surprised me in some ways. I had their relationship burned into my memory as a sudden and passionate thing, with Lewis being swept off his feet by this vivacious American divorc&eacute;e. Instead, we see here a picture of a very cautious relationship that develops slowly. Lewis, the lifelong bachelor, meets Gresham and is clearly taken with her, but always maintains a distance. Even when they marry, it's - in Lewis' words - only "technically," so that Joy can claim his British citizenship as her own. The romance - the open acknowledgement of love - comes only after her diagnosis, when Lewis is forced to confront the fact that she gives his life meaning, and that he can't imagine life without her, and they're married "properly" - by clergy, before God and without hiding the fact. Then, of course, there is the remission of her cancer, its return and her death, which forces Lewis to re-evaluate everything he believes about God, in the end, coming back to the realization that pain is a part of happiness, and that God is not to be blamed for Joy's death, but thanked for her life. Although the movie is spiritual, it's not in your face religious. It's a human movie; a sensitive movie - in the end, it's very moving. There's a lot of theological reflection that takes place on the relationship between suffering and faith, pain and happiness and how God fits into the picture, but there's nothing here that demands that one be a believer to enjoy this. It's fascinating to see the evolution of Lewis, who - by the sudden love he feels for Joy - has to change virtually everything about his life; perhaps best summed up by the bedroom scene, in which, on the first night they share a room together, Joy asks him what his routine is. He describes it, but then admits that he doesn't know what to do now that she's part of it. She says something like "you do everything you did before, then you just lie down - and I'm here." That exchange summed up both the gentleness of the movie and the challenge for Lewis of re-evaluating his entire life and everything he believed. C.S. Lewis is best known, of course, as an author of children's books. Fewer people realize that he was also quite an accomplished theologian. Regardless of how you think of him, though, he is a fascinating man, and while this movie is certainly gentle rather than exciting and romantic rather than passionate, it provides a fascinating glimpse of his spiritual journey. One also shouldn't overlook the excellent performances from Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger in the lead roles. 8/10

    I have truly loved the Narnia books by Clive Staples Lewis since I was 7. I have a memory of staying up late in bed, reading the last few chapters of "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" before seeing the movie the next day. Little did I know of C. S. Lewis' (Jack) personal life. He was a very reserved man as is shown here, and he doesn't have much of a life outside of teaching and writing. That is, until he meets Joy Gresham, an American woman living a hard life with her abusive husband and young son. Jack takes them in and for the first time, begins to love like he never thought he could. There is much more to this film than what meets the eye. It it is a story of compassion, love, loss, grief, and faith. As a Christian, it is wonderful to see a film with such deep and moral messages that revolve and even feel aimed, at me specifically. Anthony Hopkins does a magnificent job in portraying the famous and troubled writer. This is a movie worth watching again and again.

    I'm impressed with the volume of favorable reviews of this film. If you've gone this far, there's no reason at all for me to rehash the plot, the marvelous acting, or the directorial skills displayed here. If I may add something new to the reviews, I would like to say that it's a sad world where Anthony Hopkins is much more known for his portrayal of Hannibal Lechter in The Silence Of The Lambs franchise. I despised those movies, not because I don't like horrific flicks. Check out my other reviews if you think I'm a sob sister who just can't take it. But this is not a review of those films, so I'll proceed...What makes this film rise to greatness is it's portrayal of a man who thinks he has life, the universe, and everything, all wrapped up in a tidy intellectual package, and then finds himself doing and feeling things which force him to completely reevaluate the foundations of his life and faith. I can't help but think that there are many Christians who considered the subject of C. S. Lewis to be safe ground to venture through. Those who only know him through his Narnia stories, and the approval given for those films by their clergy, must have been quite surprised to find the man willing to break immigration laws to wed a somewhat bohemian woman for reasons of citizenship. I hope that those who first recoil at the truth of his life, grow as Lewis did as he faced the contradictions to his smug, self satisfied, view of himself and his faith. If you're a macho man who can't imagine himself capable of crying at a film, get ready to have the rug pulled out from under your pretension. This film hits notes of truth in sadness that are specifically male, and completely missing from 99.99% of cinematography. You will cry not because you are manipulated, but because you recognize yourself in this gentle intellectual facing the glory of love, the pain of unfair tragedy, and the responsibility that endures beyond the drama. Whoever you are, whatever you believe, watch this wonderful film. Share it with a loved one.

    Richard Attenboroughs best directorial piece. This is the true story about C.S.Lewis...an above average English novelist. The year is 1951 when he meets a fan( a U.S.A. lady) played by Debra Winger. Lewis gives us the very strong impression..that he does not know how to..."do it". Well there was no internet then..!! He tries a weak kiss...but it doesn't really work... Winger puts on an ..."&Iuml; know its very complex" act as she attempts to give reassurance. There is a huge stop sign for these fine people...and it says STOP. Winger develops terminal cancer..which is never a good sign......C.S.--- Decides to fall in love with this...USA....lady ...and marries her. It really is a fine film...even if the young kids wont get it. They will be looking for...Super--Heroes, or Will Ferrel. Is there a difference..???.....Both are not funny..... A good...movie,,,,,if you are over 32

    Movies don't always have to have an exciting premise. Sometimes a touching romance is not about two passionate young lovers but about an older couple finding each other long after their well-travelled youth. Shadowlands does not even have The African Queen's adventuresome setting, being set amid the quietness of 1950s Oxford. And yet it has on its side exceptional writing, deep humanity and good taste. Based by writer William Nicholson on an episode in the life of author C.S. Lewis, every scene is like a warm and meticulously sculpted syllabub, a little slice of human interaction that, whether joyful, angry or sad seems shot through with affection and universal truth. The picture benefits considerably from the sublime tranquillity of its lead man Anthony Hopkins. Blessed with such a piercing gaze, Hopkins has never needed to do anything ostentatious to hold our attention, but this is not to say his acting is simple. Shadowlands sees him moving in the depths of serene understatement, portraying a man not so much repressed as sparing in his emotional expression. When he does have a few outbursts towards the end of the movie, the effect hits us all the harder. On the other hand, Debra Winger seems to me a rather lazy choice for the role of Joy Gresham, since her most successful role prior to that had been in Terms of Endearment as another woman dying of cancer. She gives a decent account of herself though, showing us a woman with a hard exterior around a warm heart. Richard Attenborough has never been anything more than a mediocre director of drama or comedy or action, or anything. But he does have a few exceptional qualities, and one is the beauty with which he endows his work. There are several moments in Shadowlands, such as when Hopkins and Winger ascend a narrow staircase onto a tower top, or wend their way through the Herefordshire countryside, that something quietly breathtaking will slowly steal across the shot. Attenborough gives us a feeling of awe at landscapes and cityscapes without drawing too much obvious attention to them. Above all he directs with a slow subtlety that grants the picture its necessary dignity. One of the strangest things about it all was that when he helmed this movie he had just come back from playing a man with a bad Scots accent in Jurassic Park. Despite being all about the man, Shadowlands barely mentions the high fantasy of Lewis's Narnia novels for which he is best-known. The fact that he is famous for his work in fact seems entirely inconsequential to the story. Rather, it's the case that a handful of real events of his life have provided a story in themselves. This is a picture that is often profoundly moving in its normality.

    "Shadowlands" is possibly the most emotionally resonant, evocative film made in the 1990s, and it is amazing that this motion picture has not been available on region 1 DVD for many years. Anthony Hopkins plays the Oxford don well, though his Welsh-accented English would have been more accurate had it an Irish tinge instead. Debra Winger is an appealing choice for Joy Gresham, but her Brooklyn accent comes and goes, sometimes within a single scene. She could have used a language coach. Though much attention is paid to period detail (1952), it is jarring to see some post-Beatles moptops on several of Lewis' Oxford colleagues (Christopher Riley, marvellously played by John Wood, for one) and their scenes spoil the illusion somewhat. The film ends with a crisis of faith for C. S. Lewis after the death of his beloved Joy, which doubtless resonated with many viewers who have no particular convictions, but in truth Lewis' faith in Jesus Christ was renewed yet again. Lord Richard Attenborough did a fine job of direction, as did George Fenton with the film's score, and William Nicholson who adapted his own stage play. The resulting movie, whether intentional or not, shares some of the same ambiance as "Love Letters" and "Brief Encounter" (both filmed in 1945).

    Shadowlands is a wonderful movie, for so many reasons: the fact that it is about the author of the Narnia books (many people know nothing about him except for "Narnia"), the beautiful interiors and the academic, time-honoured atmosphere at the old university, philosophical thoughts, poetical language, the fact that Anthony Hopkins had the lead (everything with Antony Hopkins in it automatically becomes sublime!)... One wishes that one could have had a teacher like Lewis/Hopkins when one was young! :-) But best of all was the love story, of course. It was very romantic when the bogus marriage turned into real love, and the couple got married for real with a priest! This is of course a not uncommon theme in romantic movies - but this time it was about real people, and it had happened just like that in reality, which made the impact on the viewer even stronger! ...and it was of course even more tragic when Joy (the American wife) died, as love had come to C.S. Lewis so late in life... The reasons I give the movie "only" 9 stars instead of 10, are two. First, I did not find the American woman very sympathetic. It would have been much more fun with a nicer and more beautiful woman as Lewis'/Hopkins' great love... Of course it might be that she is portrayed accurately, but as the portrait of Lewis is also romanticized (he was not as handsome or charming as Hopkins! :-) ), the filmmakers could have used their poetical license to make the wife a more lovable character as well! The other reason is that I found the movie just a little too slow and long. It would have been a great improvement if they had shortened the slow parts with 10-15 minutes all in all.

    Immensely moving, with a stunning, complex performance by Anthony Hopkins, and a very good one by Debra Winger as his slow developing love. Yes, it's corny in a few moments, obvious in a few others, but overall this is a highly intelligent, thoughtful, subtle look at damaged adults reaching for love and dealing with loss. By far my favorite of Attenborough's films. A 'tearjerker', but elevated way beyond that by the writing, direction and acting, into a profound examination of the way we need love to lift us up, while that very thing makes us so vulnerable. Ironically, while this may be the strongest of Attenborough's films, with a stellar cast, great reviews, a fascinating main character (The novelist C.S. Lewis), and powerful universal emotions, it has long been unavailable on DVD. It seems almost a forgotten film, which is everyone's loss.

    This is a very strange film, a most extraordinary film. C.S. Lewis and his brother are two unmarried professors in Oxford, living together in the same house. They are living in this haven of peace that Oxford is, entirely dedicated to learning and knowledge, to the maturation of men in the teenagers they get every year, year in and year out. It is their function, their aim, their target and they cannot be derailed from this perspective. Oxford is their own territory and their own world and the world has no limits within these limits of Oxford, and an eventual trip to London for a lecture, but never beyond. C.S. Lewis is a special case in that entirely ghettoized intellectual world. He writes stories for children, for the children he will never have. These stories are about a strange world beyond the bottom of a wardrobe in the attic of his home. A world of bad and evil, of fighting for good and against evil. And yet his life is a routine that would kill thinking out of any human being. But not him, and plenty others around him. They are righteously living in the comfort of academia. The top echelon of that academia. Till one day when an American woman and her young child comes up and asks for an autograph. And the ghetto implodes. The peace is gone, love takes its place. The diplomatic marriage will eventually give way to a real marriage, but on a sick bed in a hospital. She finds out, too late of course, she has bone cancer and will eventually and soon die. And that's how C.S. Lewis discovers there is another love he had never really thought of and certainly not experienced: love for another human being that becomes your horizon and for whom you are dawn and dusk at the same time. That love that makes you mute and talkative in the same minute, so much the one and so much the other that your tongue trips on your muteness and your words get strangled in your talk. Love as a feeling of total gift of yourself to the other and of the other to yourself, with the tremendous responsibility that goes along with it. And death then becomes an unacceptable step away from this reality. Death comes and love will never go away and will turn into suffering, longing, wanting, needing and never getting the satisfaction you could ever wish to get. Love is for life I was going to say, oh yes, love is for life and even beyond life, for death if it comes and when it comes. Love never turns into ashes and never goes back to dirt because it is not dirt, it is the soul of the heart and the mind of life. And that's what C.S. Lewis actually discovers late in his life and never forgot after that. He finally learned how to be a fully blooming man, but it hurts so much when you learn love from within the death of your beloved. I must say the slow rhythm of the film, the very intimates scenes, the delicacy of the language and the acting, and the art of Anthony Hopkins serve that theme so well, so beautifully. It seems to be able to last for ever and ever, and yet the young son, now step-son, is there to remind you the show of life goes on for ever and ever on the stage of the strutting human beings we are.

    Richard Attenborough is a classy fellow who deserves to be recognized as a great film director. His more recent "Grey Owl" is brilliant! This film moves the heart like no other film I have ever witnessed! "Forrest Gump" gently touches the nerve endings. This film rams the gut! But what a classy production this is all the way through. A beautiful mellifluous script with tenderly rendered scenes of sensitive acting will have any audience in full approbation clamouring for more. I have said enough. You will cry in this one. Hopkins as a leading man makes C.S. Lewis human. This is a wonderful, tender, gentle-paced film that will stand the test of time! Mark my words! Own it today!
