    I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and "Jumanji" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie & it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life.

    The thing that grabs people about this movie is the computer effects. They are supposed to be of a very high quality and very realistic. I must digress at this point because when I saw this movie recently I discovered that the effects were not as great as they are made out to be. In fact, the lion looked quite out of proportion and the monkeys looked quite fake. I think that they pushed themselves to a point where they could not do any better. Even though some of the effects were quite irritating, I did enjoy Jumanji. It is an adventure movie with everything, a stampede, deadly insects, lions, floods, earthquakes, and even a psychotic hunter with a very big gun. What makes this adventure movie different is that it is not set in the middle of Africa but rather in a quiet New England town, that is quiet until all of these things are unleashed upon it. The film begins in 1969 where little Alan Parrish is running away from bullies. He goes to his father's factory and notices a chest in one of the construction sites. Opening the chest he finds the game Jumanji. He takes it back home and plays it with his friend at which he promptly disappears. Fifteen years later, another two children find the game and decide to play it and release poor Alan Parrish. Having done that they realise that they must finished the game and revert everything back to normal. The interesting thing that I see in this movie is the difference in the time between 1969 and 1995. In 1969 everything is nice and everybody is friendly, with the exception of the bullies. Business is booming and the town is lovely and clean. This changes in 1995 for when Alan walks through the town we see a very different place. The once clean town park is now a squat for beggars, most of the shops have closed down and the Parish Shoe company has been abandoned. Alan Parrish spends 16 years in a jungle to emerge in a world that has completely changed. As is typical of Hollywood, everything reverts back to its original form at the end, which deludes us with the idea that we can return the world to the good old days. This is something that we cannot do. The pleasant memories of our past will always remain there, and as is seen in Jumaji, not everything about the past is all that pleasant. We can look forward to a time when everything is restored, but this restoration goes back to the time of the Garden of Eden. The perfect world of Eden will be restored, rather than our pleasant childhood memories. I still like this movie though. Robin Williams is not one of my most favourite actors, but he does not turn me off as actors such as Van Damme do. Rather, he is reasonable. It is not him that attracts me to the movie, but rather the story. The story is an adventure and it is what you get. Jumaji basically delivers what it promises.

    Unhappy young Alan disappears while playing creepy board game Jumanji. Years later, two more children find the game and continue where Alan left off. This film takes a simple idea and fills it with wonderfully executed fantasy. The CGI - this was one of the earliest films to contain extensive computer generated effects, principally to bring various animals to life - still holds up well, but the excitement generated by the rapidly deteriorating circumstances of the protagonists takes second place to the character progression of Alan, his friend Sarah (as an adult) and Peter and Judy, the later children. All the performers do well, but Robin Williams excels in a part which particularly suits his barely reined in mania. Jumanji has heart, and is a hugely entertaining family movie.

    I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was. The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done. This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too.

    Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. "Jumanji" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game.

    When Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realise its unimaginable powers until he is magically transported, in front of his friend Sarah,into the game. There he remains for 26 years until he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children. Now a grown man, Alan reunites with Sarah and, together with Judy and Peter, tries to outwit the game's powerful forces.... Released at that strange time when Williams was one of the most bankable stars in movies, this marked the start of him thinking anything he did turned to gold. It's the kind of film you thought you like the first time you saw it, but on a second viewing, it's pretty bad stuff. Firstly, it's an effects extravaganza where the effects are really bad, I mean, even Williams false beard sucks. and then too much happens toward the end. Parrish has father issues with a hunter, the boy turns into a monkey, and Dunst just stands around waiting for 2002. See it, and remember how good you thought it was, and how poor it really is.

    Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good. There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid. With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him. Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him. What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film. Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good.

    My rate: 7/10. My "own" Oscars: BEST ACTOR-ROBIN WILLIAMS, BEST SPECIAL EFFECTS, BEST FAMILY FANTASY ADVENTURE, BEST STORY! These are the Oscars I will add for Jumanji. In one word: a very fun film! This "original" film just blew up my mind with amazement!!! Robin Williams has a wonderful performance in the film and plays perfectly. The cast, good either. It's a wonderful film. What I like about the film is that it is mysterious (there is some suspense) and terrifying at the same time. It is a delicious little mix of comedy and of very clever ideas. Probably, the best ideas I've ever imagined. Very imaginative. I strongly recommend it for those who are very interested in mix of comedy-fantasy-adventure. This is the one. I did like it. My last word: PERFECT!

    Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid & I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game. 'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism & magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh & Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining & magical. It offers humor, magic & emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd & Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up!

It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game.

    When Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realise its unimaginable powers until he is magically transported, in front of his friend Sarah,into the game. There he remains for 26 years until he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children. Now a grown man, Alan reunites with Sarah and, together with Judy and Peter, tries to outwit the game's powerful forces.... Released at that strange time when Williams was one of the most bankable stars in movies, this marked the start of him thinking anything he did turned to gold. It's the kind of film you thought you like the first time you saw it, but on a second viewing, it's pretty bad stuff. Firstly, it's an effects extravaganza where the effects are really bad, I mean, even Williams false beard sucks. and then too much happens toward the end. Parrish has father issues with a hunter, the boy turns into a monkey, and Dunst just stands around waiting for 2002. See it, and remember how good you thought it was, and how poor it really is.

    Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good. There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid. With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him. Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him. What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film. Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good.

    My rate: 7/10. My "own" Oscars: BEST ACTOR-ROBIN WILLIAMS, BEST SPECIAL EFFECTS, BEST FAMILY FANTASY ADVENTURE, BEST STORY! These are the Oscars I will add for Jumanji. In one word: a very fun film! This "original" film just blew up my mind with amazement!!! Robin Williams has a wonderful performance in the film and plays perfectly. The cast, good either. It's a wonderful film. What I like about the film is that it is mysterious (there is some suspense) and terrifying at the same time. It is a delicious little mix of comedy and of very clever ideas. Probably, the best ideas I've ever imagined. Very imaginative. I strongly recommend it for those who are very interested in mix of comedy-fantasy-adventure. This is the one. I did like it. My last word: PERFECT!

    Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid & I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game. 'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism & magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh & Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining & magical. It offers humor, magic & emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd & Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up!

    I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and "Jumanji" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie & it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life.

    The thing that grabs people about this movie is the computer effects. They are supposed to be of a very high quality and very realistic. I must digress at this point because when I saw this movie recently I discovered that the effects were not as great as they are made out to be. In fact, the lion looked quite out of proportion and the monkeys looked quite fake. I think that they pushed themselves to a point where they could not do any better. Even though some of the effects were quite irritating, I did enjoy Jumanji. It is an adventure movie with everything, a stampede, deadly insects, lions, floods, earthquakes, and even a psychotic hunter with a very big gun. What makes this adventure movie different is that it is not set in the middle of Africa but rather in a quiet New England town, that is quiet until all of these things are unleashed upon it. The film begins in 1969 where little Alan Parrish is running away from bullies. He goes to his father's factory and notices a chest in one of the construction sites. Opening the chest he finds the game Jumanji. He takes it back home and plays it with his friend at which he promptly disappears. Fifteen years later, another two children find the game and decide to play it and release poor Alan Parrish. Having done that they realise that they must finished the game and revert everything back to normal. The interesting thing that I see in this movie is the difference in the time between 1969 and 1995. In 1969 everything is nice and everybody is friendly, with the exception of the bullies. Business is booming and the town is lovely and clean. This changes in 1995 for when Alan walks through the town we see a very different place. The once clean town park is now a squat for beggars, most of the shops have closed down and the Parish Shoe company has been abandoned. Alan Parrish spends 16 years in a jungle to emerge in a world that has completely changed. As is typical of Hollywood, everything reverts back to its original form at the end, which deludes us with the idea that we can return the world to the good old days. This is something that we cannot do. The pleasant memories of our past will always remain there, and as is seen in Jumaji, not everything about the past is all that pleasant. We can look forward to a time when everything is restored, but this restoration goes back to the time of the Garden of Eden. The perfect world of Eden will be restored, rather than our pleasant childhood memories. I still like this movie though. Robin Williams is not one of my most favourite actors, but he does not turn me off as actors such as Van Damme do. Rather, he is reasonable. It is not him that attracts me to the movie, but rather the story. The story is an adventure and it is what you get. Jumaji basically delivers what it promises.

    Unhappy young Alan disappears while playing creepy board game Jumanji. Years later, two more children find the game and continue where Alan left off. This film takes a simple idea and fills it with wonderfully executed fantasy. The CGI - this was one of the earliest films to contain extensive computer generated effects, principally to bring various animals to life - still holds up well, but the excitement generated by the rapidly deteriorating circumstances of the protagonists takes second place to the character progression of Alan, his friend Sarah (as an adult) and Peter and Judy, the later children. All the performers do well, but Robin Williams excels in a part which particularly suits his barely reined in mania. Jumanji has heart, and is a hugely entertaining family movie.

    I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was. The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done. This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too.

    Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. "Jumanji" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game.

This is something that we cannot do. The pleasant memories of our past will always remain there, and as is seen in Jumaji, not everything about the past is all that pleasant. We can look forward to a time when everything is restored, but this restoration goes back to the time of the Garden of Eden. The perfect world of Eden will be restored, rather than our pleasant childhood memories. I still like this movie though. Robin Williams is not one of my most favourite actors, but he does not turn me off as actors such as Van Damme do. Rather, he is reasonable. It is not him that attracts me to the movie, but rather the story. The story is an adventure and it is what you get. Jumaji basically delivers what it promises.

    Unhappy young Alan disappears while playing creepy board game Jumanji. Years later, two more children find the game and continue where Alan left off. This film takes a simple idea and fills it with wonderfully executed fantasy. The CGI - this was one of the earliest films to contain extensive computer generated effects, principally to bring various animals to life - still holds up well, but the excitement generated by the rapidly deteriorating circumstances of the protagonists takes second place to the character progression of Alan, his friend Sarah (as an adult) and Peter and Judy, the later children. All the performers do well, but Robin Williams excels in a part which particularly suits his barely reined in mania. Jumanji has heart, and is a hugely entertaining family movie.

    I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was. The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done. This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too.

    Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. "Jumanji" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game.

    When Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realise its unimaginable powers until he is magically transported, in front of his friend Sarah,into the game. There he remains for 26 years until he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children. Now a grown man, Alan reunites with Sarah and, together with Judy and Peter, tries to outwit the game's powerful forces.... Released at that strange time when Williams was one of the most bankable stars in movies, this marked the start of him thinking anything he did turned to gold. It's the kind of film you thought you like the first time you saw it, but on a second viewing, it's pretty bad stuff. Firstly, it's an effects extravaganza where the effects are really bad, I mean, even Williams false beard sucks. and then too much happens toward the end. Parrish has father issues with a hunter, the boy turns into a monkey, and Dunst just stands around waiting for 2002. See it, and remember how good you thought it was, and how poor it really is.

    Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good. There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid. With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him. Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him. What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film. Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good.

    My rate: 7/10. My "own" Oscars: BEST ACTOR-ROBIN WILLIAMS, BEST SPECIAL EFFECTS, BEST FAMILY FANTASY ADVENTURE, BEST STORY! These are the Oscars I will add for Jumanji. In one word: a very fun film! This "original" film just blew up my mind with amazement!!! Robin Williams has a wonderful performance in the film and plays perfectly. The cast, good either. It's a wonderful film. What I like about the film is that it is mysterious (there is some suspense) and terrifying at the same time. It is a delicious little mix of comedy and of very clever ideas. Probably, the best ideas I've ever imagined. Very imaginative. I strongly recommend it for those who are very interested in mix of comedy-fantasy-adventure. This is the one. I did like it. My last word: PERFECT!

    Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid & I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game. 'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism & magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh & Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining & magical. It offers humor, magic & emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd & Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up!

    I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and "Jumanji" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie & it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life.

    The thing that grabs people about this movie is the computer effects. They are supposed to be of a very high quality and very realistic. I must digress at this point because when I saw this movie recently I discovered that the effects were not as great as they are made out to be. In fact, the lion looked quite out of proportion and the monkeys looked quite fake. I think that they pushed themselves to a point where they could not do any better. Even though some of the effects were quite irritating, I did enjoy Jumanji. It is an adventure movie with everything, a stampede, deadly insects, lions, floods, earthquakes, and even a psychotic hunter with a very big gun. What makes this adventure movie different is that it is not set in the middle of Africa but rather in a quiet New England town, that is quiet until all of these things are unleashed upon it. The film begins in 1969 where little Alan Parrish is running away from bullies. He goes to his father's factory and notices a chest in one of the construction sites. Opening the chest he finds the game Jumanji. He takes it back home and plays it with his friend at which he promptly disappears. Fifteen years later, another two children find the game and decide to play it and release poor Alan Parrish. Having done that they realise that they must finished the game and revert everything back to normal. The interesting thing that I see in this movie is the difference in the time between 1969 and 1995. In 1969 everything is nice and everybody is friendly, with the exception of the bullies. Business is booming and the town is lovely and clean. This changes in 1995 for when Alan walks through the town we see a very different place. The once clean town park is now a squat for beggars, most of the shops have closed down and the Parish Shoe company has been abandoned. Alan Parrish spends 16 years in a jungle to emerge in a world that has completely changed. As is typical of Hollywood, everything reverts back to its original form at the end, which deludes us with the idea that we can return the world to the good old days. This is something that we cannot do. The pleasant memories of our past will always remain there, and as is seen in Jumaji, not everything about the past is all that pleasant. We can look forward to a time when everything is restored, but this restoration goes back to the time of the Garden of Eden. The perfect world of Eden will be restored, rather than our pleasant childhood memories. I still like this movie though. Robin Williams is not one of my most favourite actors, but he does not turn me off as actors such as Van Damme do. Rather, he is reasonable. It is not him that attracts me to the movie, but rather the story. The story is an adventure and it is what you get. Jumaji basically delivers what it promises.

    My rate: 7/10. My "own" Oscars: BEST ACTOR-ROBIN WILLIAMS, BEST SPECIAL EFFECTS, BEST FAMILY FANTASY ADVENTURE, BEST STORY! These are the Oscars I will add for Jumanji. In one word: a very fun film! This "original" film just blew up my mind with amazement!!! Robin Williams has a wonderful performance in the film and plays perfectly. The cast, good either. It's a wonderful film. What I like about the film is that it is mysterious (there is some suspense) and terrifying at the same time. It is a delicious little mix of comedy and of very clever ideas. Probably, the best ideas I've ever imagined. Very imaginative. I strongly recommend it for those who are very interested in mix of comedy-fantasy-adventure. This is the one. I did like it. My last word: PERFECT!

    Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid & I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game. 'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism & magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh & Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining & magical. It offers humor, magic & emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd & Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up!

    I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and "Jumanji" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie & it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life.

    The thing that grabs people about this movie is the computer effects. They are supposed to be of a very high quality and very realistic. I must digress at this point because when I saw this movie recently I discovered that the effects were not as great as they are made out to be. In fact, the lion looked quite out of proportion and the monkeys looked quite fake. I think that they pushed themselves to a point where they could not do any better. Even though some of the effects were quite irritating, I did enjoy Jumanji. It is an adventure movie with everything, a stampede, deadly insects, lions, floods, earthquakes, and even a psychotic hunter with a very big gun. What makes this adventure movie different is that it is not set in the middle of Africa but rather in a quiet New England town, that is quiet until all of these things are unleashed upon it. The film begins in 1969 where little Alan Parrish is running away from bullies. He goes to his father's factory and notices a chest in one of the construction sites. Opening the chest he finds the game Jumanji. He takes it back home and plays it with his friend at which he promptly disappears. Fifteen years later, another two children find the game and decide to play it and release poor Alan Parrish. Having done that they realise that they must finished the game and revert everything back to normal. The interesting thing that I see in this movie is the difference in the time between 1969 and 1995. In 1969 everything is nice and everybody is friendly, with the exception of the bullies. Business is booming and the town is lovely and clean. This changes in 1995 for when Alan walks through the town we see a very different place. The once clean town park is now a squat for beggars, most of the shops have closed down and the Parish Shoe company has been abandoned. Alan Parrish spends 16 years in a jungle to emerge in a world that has completely changed. As is typical of Hollywood, everything reverts back to its original form at the end, which deludes us with the idea that we can return the world to the good old days. This is something that we cannot do. The pleasant memories of our past will always remain there, and as is seen in Jumaji, not everything about the past is all that pleasant. We can look forward to a time when everything is restored, but this restoration goes back to the time of the Garden of Eden. The perfect world of Eden will be restored, rather than our pleasant childhood memories. I still like this movie though. Robin Williams is not one of my most favourite actors, but he does not turn me off as actors such as Van Damme do. Rather, he is reasonable. It is not him that attracts me to the movie, but rather the story. The story is an adventure and it is what you get. Jumaji basically delivers what it promises.

    Unhappy young Alan disappears while playing creepy board game Jumanji. Years later, two more children find the game and continue where Alan left off. This film takes a simple idea and fills it with wonderfully executed fantasy. The CGI - this was one of the earliest films to contain extensive computer generated effects, principally to bring various animals to life - still holds up well, but the excitement generated by the rapidly deteriorating circumstances of the protagonists takes second place to the character progression of Alan, his friend Sarah (as an adult) and Peter and Judy, the later children. All the performers do well, but Robin Williams excels in a part which particularly suits his barely reined in mania. Jumanji has heart, and is a hugely entertaining family movie.

    I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was. The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done. This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too.

    Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. "Jumanji" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game.

    When Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realise its unimaginable powers until he is magically transported, in front of his friend Sarah,into the game. There he remains for 26 years until he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children. Now a grown man, Alan reunites with Sarah and, together with Judy and Peter, tries to outwit the game's powerful forces.... Released at that strange time when Williams was one of the most bankable stars in movies, this marked the start of him thinking anything he did turned to gold. It's the kind of film you thought you like the first time you saw it, but on a second viewing, it's pretty bad stuff. Firstly, it's an effects extravaganza where the effects are really bad, I mean, even Williams false beard sucks. and then too much happens toward the end. Parrish has father issues with a hunter, the boy turns into a monkey, and Dunst just stands around waiting for 2002. See it, and remember how good you thought it was, and how poor it really is.

    Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good. There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid. With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him. Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him. What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film. Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good.

Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game.

    When Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realise its unimaginable powers until he is magically transported, in front of his friend Sarah,into the game. There he remains for 26 years until he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children. Now a grown man, Alan reunites with Sarah and, together with Judy and Peter, tries to outwit the game's powerful forces.... Released at that strange time when Williams was one of the most bankable stars in movies, this marked the start of him thinking anything he did turned to gold. It's the kind of film you thought you like the first time you saw it, but on a second viewing, it's pretty bad stuff. Firstly, it's an effects extravaganza where the effects are really bad, I mean, even Williams false beard sucks. and then too much happens toward the end. Parrish has father issues with a hunter, the boy turns into a monkey, and Dunst just stands around waiting for 2002. See it, and remember how good you thought it was, and how poor it really is.

    Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good. There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid. With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him. Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him. What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film. Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good.

    My rate: 7/10. My "own" Oscars: BEST ACTOR-ROBIN WILLIAMS, BEST SPECIAL EFFECTS, BEST FAMILY FANTASY ADVENTURE, BEST STORY! These are the Oscars I will add for Jumanji. In one word: a very fun film! This "original" film just blew up my mind with amazement!!! Robin Williams has a wonderful performance in the film and plays perfectly. The cast, good either. It's a wonderful film. What I like about the film is that it is mysterious (there is some suspense) and terrifying at the same time. It is a delicious little mix of comedy and of very clever ideas. Probably, the best ideas I've ever imagined. Very imaginative. I strongly recommend it for those who are very interested in mix of comedy-fantasy-adventure. This is the one. I did like it. My last word: PERFECT!

    Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid & I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game. 'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism & magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh & Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining & magical. It offers humor, magic & emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd & Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up!

    I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and "Jumanji" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie & it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life.

    The thing that grabs people about this movie is the computer effects. They are supposed to be of a very high quality and very realistic. I must digress at this point because when I saw this movie recently I discovered that the effects were not as great as they are made out to be. In fact, the lion looked quite out of proportion and the monkeys looked quite fake. I think that they pushed themselves to a point where they could not do any better. Even though some of the effects were quite irritating, I did enjoy Jumanji. It is an adventure movie with everything, a stampede, deadly insects, lions, floods, earthquakes, and even a psychotic hunter with a very big gun. What makes this adventure movie different is that it is not set in the middle of Africa but rather in a quiet New England town, that is quiet until all of these things are unleashed upon it. The film begins in 1969 where little Alan Parrish is running away from bullies. He goes to his father's factory and notices a chest in one of the construction sites. Opening the chest he finds the game Jumanji. He takes it back home and plays it with his friend at which he promptly disappears. Fifteen years later, another two children find the game and decide to play it and release poor Alan Parrish. Having done that they realise that they must finished the game and revert everything back to normal. The interesting thing that I see in this movie is the difference in the time between 1969 and 1995. In 1969 everything is nice and everybody is friendly, with the exception of the bullies. Business is booming and the town is lovely and clean. This changes in 1995 for when Alan walks through the town we see a very different place. The once clean town park is now a squat for beggars, most of the shops have closed down and the Parish Shoe company has been abandoned. Alan Parrish spends 16 years in a jungle to emerge in a world that has completely changed. As is typical of Hollywood, everything reverts back to its original form at the end, which deludes us with the idea that we can return the world to the good old days. This is something that we cannot do. The pleasant memories of our past will always remain there, and as is seen in Jumaji, not everything about the past is all that pleasant. We can look forward to a time when everything is restored, but this restoration goes back to the time of the Garden of Eden. The perfect world of Eden will be restored, rather than our pleasant childhood memories. I still like this movie though. Robin Williams is not one of my most favourite actors, but he does not turn me off as actors such as Van Damme do. Rather, he is reasonable. It is not him that attracts me to the movie, but rather the story. The story is an adventure and it is what you get. Jumaji basically delivers what it promises.

    Unhappy young Alan disappears while playing creepy board game Jumanji. Years later, two more children find the game and continue where Alan left off. This film takes a simple idea and fills it with wonderfully executed fantasy. The CGI - this was one of the earliest films to contain extensive computer generated effects, principally to bring various animals to life - still holds up well, but the excitement generated by the rapidly deteriorating circumstances of the protagonists takes second place to the character progression of Alan, his friend Sarah (as an adult) and Peter and Judy, the later children. All the performers do well, but Robin Williams excels in a part which particularly suits his barely reined in mania. Jumanji has heart, and is a hugely entertaining family movie.

    I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was. The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done. This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too.

    Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. "Jumanji" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets.

Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game.

What makes this adventure movie different is that it is not set in the middle of Africa but rather in a quiet New England town, that is quiet until all of these things are unleashed upon it. The film begins in 1969 where little Alan Parrish is running away from bullies. He goes to his father's factory and notices a chest in one of the construction sites. Opening the chest he finds the game Jumanji. He takes it back home and plays it with his friend at which he promptly disappears. Fifteen years later, another two children find the game and decide to play it and release poor Alan Parrish. Having done that they realise that they must finished the game and revert everything back to normal. The interesting thing that I see in this movie is the difference in the time between 1969 and 1995. In 1969 everything is nice and everybody is friendly, with the exception of the bullies. Business is booming and the town is lovely and clean. This changes in 1995 for when Alan walks through the town we see a very different place. The once clean town park is now a squat for beggars, most of the shops have closed down and the Parish Shoe company has been abandoned. Alan Parrish spends 16 years in a jungle to emerge in a world that has completely changed. As is typical of Hollywood, everything reverts back to its original form at the end, which deludes us with the idea that we can return the world to the good old days. This is something that we cannot do. The pleasant memories of our past will always remain there, and as is seen in Jumaji, not everything about the past is all that pleasant. We can look forward to a time when everything is restored, but this restoration goes back to the time of the Garden of Eden. The perfect world of Eden will be restored, rather than our pleasant childhood memories. I still like this movie though. Robin Williams is not one of my most favourite actors, but he does not turn me off as actors such as Van Damme do. Rather, he is reasonable. It is not him that attracts me to the movie, but rather the story. The story is an adventure and it is what you get. Jumaji basically delivers what it promises.

    Unhappy young Alan disappears while playing creepy board game Jumanji. Years later, two more children find the game and continue where Alan left off. This film takes a simple idea and fills it with wonderfully executed fantasy. The CGI - this was one of the earliest films to contain extensive computer generated effects, principally to bring various animals to life - still holds up well, but the excitement generated by the rapidly deteriorating circumstances of the protagonists takes second place to the character progression of Alan, his friend Sarah (as an adult) and Peter and Judy, the later children. All the performers do well, but Robin Williams excels in a part which particularly suits his barely reined in mania. Jumanji has heart, and is a hugely entertaining family movie.

    I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn't remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was. The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done. This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they'd like it too.

    Unlike the game that has it's players being forced to play until it's finish. The movie can be easily turn off people, but it's not that bad of a movie. The CGI is not that great, and the jokes have this very corny humor to them, but getting past that, it's an entertaining film to watch. At least, it kept my attention for the nearly 2 hours. "Jumanji" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The basic premise stays the same: a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure. When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start creating havoc to their house and life. Only by finishing the game will make it all go away. The different between the movie and the game is the introduction of adult characters, and how the main characters (The children: Peter and Judy Shepard) on the book are now supporting cast. The movie starts out in 1969, young Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realize its unimaginable powers, until he is magically exile before the eyes of his friend, Sarah, into the untamed jungles of Jumanji. The things that come out of Jumanji are just overblown fears of what a jungle might hold for a uneducation person. Some of the things are just not that common in a jungle settling such as earthquakes, man-eating vines, and certain animals. They cut some things such as the volcano based on the book, from the movie. 26 years later he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) playing the same game. Makes you wonder what happens if its Alan turn and no body has rolled a 5 or an 8 in the game at all or a player dies. There is a plot-hole right there. Robin Williams plays the adult Alan whom rapid-fire humor makes him the most eccentric personality ever. He is great, but in this film, he's more kept back from going too crazy. It's gives the character depth so they can focus more on the story. Alan find out the world he used to know as a child, is gone as a adult. There is a very powerful nostalgia feel to the film that shows how much him being missing has effect the community. Alan reunites with Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), the young girl he play the game with in 1969. Hunt as Sarah both funny and appealing. She afraid of everything, but able to show strength when needed. She is not the damsel in distress all the time, her character is pretty believable. Together with the kids try to finish the game before more people get hurt.The producers wanted to make something of this Oedipal angle - Alan, Sarah and the kids form somewhat a makeshift nuclear family - but it's haphazard, forced and totally overwhelmed by the spectacle. The truth is they could have lick their wounds and stop playing, and never finish it and still have great lives. The CGI was great for the day for the animals action scenes. The stampede, the monkeys and others might look badly done today, but it's doesn't hurt the film too bad. Sadly, the film lacks a Jurassic Park realish feel CGI to it, some of the animals, you can totally see where they distorted the UV mapping. Some things saving this movie is the fantastic music score. James Horner did a amazing job on it. The Jumanji drums are just chilling to hear, and the visual of the games first showing up with that sound are creepy. Another character that gives fresh air to the movie is Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde), a villain man-game hunter from Jumanji who quest is to kill Alan. Jonathan Hyde play as both Alan's dad and the hunter in the film. There seems to be a thematic thing than purely to cut costs in casting. It's like it's represent the conflict between the ideas of his father and the son. Alan argument with his father about attending a boarding school, and about facing the bullying he suffer in school. It wasn't until the Jumanji, that Alan was able to grow up to be a man and face all his fears, even his father. It was the most dangerous game type of chase between them that borderline like a Richard Connell's novel. Another supporting character was Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier) a hapless shoemaker-turned-police officer who gives the movie interesting comedy humor when bad thing happen to his car and him. Director Joe Johnston was hired due to his ILM background, and the film was really trying to improve the special effects and visual effects department, but it's didn't live up to that. Certain visual effects like the animatronic spiders, and the robotic vine flower come out looking like puppets. The effects are clever but mildly disappointing; the creatures' movements have a hint of '50s-style Harryhausen puppet animation. Some children might find the film scary, will prove unnerving to small children, though violence per se is not a factor. Parents ought to consider keeping away children younger than 5. The movie is still a good movie for children, and still holds its hold. So check it out, and play the game.

    When Alan Parrish discovers a mysterious board game, he doesn't realise its unimaginable powers until he is magically transported, in front of his friend Sarah,into the game. There he remains for 26 years until he is freed from the game's spell by two unsuspecting children. Now a grown man, Alan reunites with Sarah and, together with Judy and Peter, tries to outwit the game's powerful forces.... Released at that strange time when Williams was one of the most bankable stars in movies, this marked the start of him thinking anything he did turned to gold. It's the kind of film you thought you like the first time you saw it, but on a second viewing, it's pretty bad stuff. Firstly, it's an effects extravaganza where the effects are really bad, I mean, even Williams false beard sucks. and then too much happens toward the end. Parrish has father issues with a hunter, the boy turns into a monkey, and Dunst just stands around waiting for 2002. See it, and remember how good you thought it was, and how poor it really is.

    Growing as a child, I used to love this movie when I had it on a video copy. I've watched it dozens of times and it's repeated viewings never fail to amuse me. I haven't read the children's illustration book this was based on, but later I did and I found it very amusing. Looking back at the movie, however, even as a young adult, I still love this film as much as anyone else even though the picture book itself is rather good. There are two flaws that prevented me from giving this an even higher rating. While the story is imaginative and heartwarming, the script is completely uneven. The beginning and the first few minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but the second half is where the movie started to get a lot better. There are also some really dark scenes that could easily frighten younger kids because I will admit, I did get scared at the lion and stampede parts during the film when I was a kid. With those flaws aside, everything still holds up. The 1969-1995 time-setting is magnificent and they were connected really well with the storyline as is the beautiful scenery and solid cinematography. The direction from Joe Johnston is perfect and the atmosphere is so creative that when something is wrong, it just takes you into the dangers that lie ahead especially the board game's magic power throughout the film. The characters are pretty good, too. Adam Hann-Byrd did a nice job as the young Alan Parrish as did Robin Williams, a master of comedic talent, as the older Alan Parrish. At times I actually felt sorry for him especially the scene in the beginning where he argues with his father about not wanting to be a Parrish. Even his parents' deaths made me feel sad for him. Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him. What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film. Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good.

    My rate: 7/10. My "own" Oscars: BEST ACTOR-ROBIN WILLIAMS, BEST SPECIAL EFFECTS, BEST FAMILY FANTASY ADVENTURE, BEST STORY! These are the Oscars I will add for Jumanji. In one word: a very fun film! This "original" film just blew up my mind with amazement!!! Robin Williams has a wonderful performance in the film and plays perfectly. The cast, good either. It's a wonderful film. What I like about the film is that it is mysterious (there is some suspense) and terrifying at the same time. It is a delicious little mix of comedy and of very clever ideas. Probably, the best ideas I've ever imagined. Very imaginative. I strongly recommend it for those who are very interested in mix of comedy-fantasy-adventure. This is the one. I did like it. My last word: PERFECT!

    Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid & I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game. 'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism & magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh & Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining & magical. It offers humor, magic & emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd & Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up!

    I have always thought of a parallel world right from my childhood like someone definitely is witnessing us and "Jumanji" was like a parallel world to me because i was 12 or may be 13 when i first watched this movie & it is still embedded in my heart as all time block buster. A game which is magical by its true nature and it can call animals which are very different from those of earthly animals and then we have to finish that game in order to send them back in their own world is simply fascinating. Robin sir and all others have done such an awesome job. The feeling of being in an adventurous ride is right there from start to end. The monkeys and the lion , the amazing water and the cave men , all the kids and the format of the game are simply awesome. I can say i started loving Hollywood movies right from childhood and Jumanji was surely one of the foundation stone of my present affection towards Hollywood. Truly if someone who is reading this has not witnessed this masterpiece then i must advice him/her to just watch it NOW and have a good time of their life.

    The thing that grabs people about this movie is the computer effects. They are supposed to be of a very high quality and very realistic. I must digress at this point because when I saw this movie recently I discovered that the effects were not as great as they are made out to be. In fact, the lion looked quite out of proportion and the monkeys looked quite fake. I think that they pushed themselves to a point where they could not do any better. Even though some of the effects were quite irritating, I did enjoy Jumanji. It is an adventure movie with everything, a stampede, deadly insects, lions, floods, earthquakes, and even a psychotic hunter with a very big gun. What makes this adventure movie different is that it is not set in the middle of Africa but rather in a quiet New England town, that is quiet until all of these things are unleashed upon it. The film begins in 1969 where little Alan Parrish is running away from bullies. He goes to his father's factory and notices a chest in one of the construction sites. Opening the chest he finds the game Jumanji. He takes it back home and plays it with his friend at which he promptly disappears. Fifteen years later, another two children find the game and decide to play it and release poor Alan Parrish. Having done that they realise that they must finished the game and revert everything back to normal. The interesting thing that I see in this movie is the difference in the time between 1969 and 1995. In 1969 everything is nice and everybody is friendly, with the exception of the bullies. Business is booming and the town is lovely and clean. This changes in 1995 for when Alan walks through the town we see a very different place. The once clean town park is now a squat for beggars, most of the shops have closed down and the Parish Shoe company has been abandoned. Alan Parrish spends 16 years in a jungle to emerge in a world that has completely changed. As is typical of Hollywood, everything reverts back to its original form at the end, which deludes us with the idea that we can return the world to the good old days. This is something that we cannot do. The pleasant memories of our past will always remain there, and as is seen in Jumaji, not everything about the past is all that pleasant. We can look forward to a time when everything is restored, but this restoration goes back to the time of the Garden of Eden. The perfect world of Eden will be restored, rather than our pleasant childhood memories. I still like this movie though. Robin Williams is not one of my most favourite actors, but he does not turn me off as actors such as Van Damme do. Rather, he is reasonable. It is not him that attracts me to the movie, but rather the story. The story is an adventure and it is what you get. Jumaji basically delivers what it promises.

Several cast members did their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is so cute as Judy Shepard and Bradley Pierce (the voice actor of Chip from Beauty and the Beast) is also likable as Peter Shepard. While Laura Bell Bundy did a decent job as the young Sarah Whittle, I think Bonnie Hunt did great playing the older Sarah Whittle due to her chemistry with Alan. The villain, Van Pelt, is great and Jonathan Hyde, who also plays Alan's father, Sam Parrish, played his role perfectly with a sinister tone to him. What I liked the most about the movie, however, is the music score from James Horner. I didn't understand why some people hated it for being too boring and overlong. I personally disagree because it's orchestra is well-made with an atmospheric drum chanting. It also had some nice action moments that never fails to take ever single inch of my breath away and they fitted perfectly to the overall darker tone of the film. Overall, Jumanji isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's completely underrated despite the mixed reception it had upon it's first release. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet. It's that good.

    My rate: 7/10. My "own" Oscars: BEST ACTOR-ROBIN WILLIAMS, BEST SPECIAL EFFECTS, BEST FAMILY FANTASY ADVENTURE, BEST STORY! These are the Oscars I will add for Jumanji. In one word: a very fun film! This "original" film just blew up my mind with amazement!!! Robin Williams has a wonderful performance in the film and plays perfectly. The cast, good either. It's a wonderful film. What I like about the film is that it is mysterious (there is some suspense) and terrifying at the same time. It is a delicious little mix of comedy and of very clever ideas. Probably, the best ideas I've ever imagined. Very imaginative. I strongly recommend it for those who are very interested in mix of comedy-fantasy-adventure. This is the one. I did like it. My last word: PERFECT!

    Joe Johnston's 'Jumanji' is A Great Family Entertainer, that holds tremendous recall value. I Loved It as a kid & I still enjoy myself watching it. Its A Gem of a Film! 'Jumanji' Synopsis: When two kids play an old magic board-game they found, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game. 'Jumanji' is for those who believe in escapism & magic. The Screenplay Written by Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh & Jim Strain, is hugely entertaining & magical. It offers humor, magic & emotion. Joe Johnston's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography & Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is marvelous in the lead role. Bonnie Hunt is delightful. Adam Hann-Byrd & Kirsten Dunst are charming. Bradley Pierce is adequate. On the whole, 'Jumanji' is a joyride. Two Thumbs Up!
