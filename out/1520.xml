    Richard takes a group of his friends up to a secluded cottage to discuss their fears as a part of his university report. He finds an old wooden life-size dummy which is named "Morty". It was in his family for years. Anyways, they decide to tell Morty their fears. Some of their fears include bugs, water, heights, growing old, etc. Eventually, Morty begins to pop up in places scaring the group. And it isn't long before Morty comes to life and begins killing a few of them by using their fears. There are some subplots involved in the movie such as the identity of the campus rapist. We see a woman attacked on campus by an unknown assailant and discover that someone has been raping girls at the college. It is quickly obvious that the rapist is among the group of friends. And we also follow the individual relationships between each of the couples, which are mostly dysfunctional. There is also some weird borderline incest scene which was unnecessary. A lot of it just seemed to over the place. The acting is decent enough to not ruin the movie. And there are some interesting twists regarding some of the character's pasts (especially Richard's), but the film is too all over the place. The Fear never sticks to one plot for long periods of time. We've got this wooden person roaming around, but we are also trying to figure out the identity of the campus rapist. I think The Fear would have been better if it focused more on the creepy wooden dummy Morty. It trailed off too much onto other story lines and failed to provide any scares or frightening moments. Interesting twists, but this did not scare me in the slightest which is what a horror movie should do. 4/10

    I give this movie a 10 for several reasons. The acting was excellent and the movie had the effect that a horror movie is supposed to elicit. This movie brings the same emotions to mind as if and when you have ever had a clown or some other doll sitting in your bedroom at night staring at you, only in this instance it is worse because the doll is a life-sized carved wooden effigy, kind of like a cigar-store Indian. There is subtle suspense throughout the movie, and gets delightfully worse at the end. The horror in this movie is both at times psychological(is it all in their heads?)and at other times actually happening. I recommend this movie to horror movie fans and it is a prized possession in my collection.

    This movie is seriously lacking in its one fundamental ingredient; horror. It's amazingly shocking to see what weird choices the film-makers made with this movie, that all go at the expense of the quality of the movie. The main concept and idea behind this movie certainly deserved to get a better treatment. And I also must admit that when the true horror/slasher aspects of the movie kick in, the movie is actually still quite good and enjoyable to watch. But only problem is that it isn't until the last 20 minutes or so that the movie truly becomes a slasher and 10 minutes later it has all ended again already. And what an horrible sudden ending it has. So there is actually very little to enjoy for the horror lovers among us, myself included. The movie is basically all build up and no pay off. The movie keeps dragging on with its character development and only throws in some fake scares to help you to remind that this is supposed to be an horror movie you're watching. This movie is some real wasted potential. I really liked the killer and the whole idea behind him, which makes me wish that this movie was given into the hands of someone more capable, or someone with some more experience with the genre at the very least. This was the first and only, as of yet, movie that Vincent Robert directed. Prior to this he also had very little experience with the movie making business, so why he ever was given the opportunity to directed this movie is a bit of a mystery to me. Wes Craven was in the cast, couldn't he at least had given the film-makers a couple of tips on film-making as well. The movie has a cheap video look over it but hey, that's what you get from an '90's movie. It tries to be like a good genre movie from the '80's but it basically only does this by throwing in a bunch of unlikeable persons, who are also all sleeping with each other, or at least are busy trying to. Granted that this is far from the worst thing I have ever seen but it unfortunately ain't much good, original or interesting enough either. 4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    ***Three Out of Ten Stars*** A serial killer possesses a Native American wooden statue named Morty, because the serial killer committed suicide and just cant rest! The serial killer's son convinces a bunch of his friends to spend Halloween at his grandparent's estate in the country. Their plan is to complete a ritual on Halloween night that will bring Morty, the wooden statue, to life. All of this to bring peace to the serial killer! It seems the serial killer's son instigated this activity, perhaps because he's a psycho himself? All we do know for sure is that these friends are unaware that the statue is possessed by a serial killer's spirit. What this all has to do with Halloween, I don't know. And that's why I rented the film, because I thought it had something to do with Halloween. The only thing this film has to do with Halloween is that there are some lighted pumpkins in the background, and that the events supposedly take place on Halloween night. That's one of the biggest disappointments here, the film tickets itself as a Halloween scare, but there's no feeling of Halloween whatsoever. The filmmakers clearly tacked their crappy plot onto Halloween to trick people into seeing this debacle. Wow! That's all I can say, is wow! This film is a complete disaster... I gave it every chance but it failed on every level. The only slightly redeeming quality of this film is the cinematography: There is nothing lazy about the cinematography; the shots progress rapidly and are probably the only thing that kept me from falling asleep. Besides rapid shot cuts, there's nothing redeeming in regards to the acting, directing, or plot. The sound and lighting are sufficient, but nothing to write home about. It's really frustrating, because it seems as if the filmmakers had the financial means to produce a somewhat respectable film. The basic idea of a mystical figure stalking and killing people based on their inner most fears is a great idea. Unfortunately, the filmmakers delve into ridiculous relationship sequences and obnoxious youth group gatherings that have no impact on the core story. The serial killer's son's friends have no personalities and are extremely unlikeable. Let me also mention Mitch, the douche bag boyfriend with an obviously fake English accent and the resident Native American who acts as the guardian for the wooden statue Morty for some unbeknownst reason. I could go on and on with the negatives of this film, but why? It's simply horrid. I really don't know what the bottom line plot of this film is? The jump scares don't work. There's no gore. There's NO nudity. There's no graphic violence. What the hell is the point of this film? The climax is non-existent. Morty is supposed to be made of wood but looks like some ham actor in a rubber jump suit. It's really just one asinine film making error after another. Just stay away!

    "The Fear" is certainly flawed for what could've been a lot of fun. **SPOILERS** In order to get a better understanding of psychological aspects, student Richard, (Eddie Bowz) is assigned a group of students, Ashley, (Heather Medway) Troy, (Darin Heames) Gerald, (Antonio Lewis Todd) Mindy, (Monique Mannen) and tag-alongs Leslie, (Ann Turkel) and Vance Cooper, (Leland Howard III) to a cabin in the woods for an experiment on fear. As he begins his sessions, his Uncle Pete, (Vince Edwards) and daughter Tanya, (Anna Karin) show up to ask for a room for the weekend, and he takes them in on his sessions. As they start to overcome their fears one by one, they have an idea that an Indian statue is more than just that, and when it eventually is proved true, they all have to face their individual fears to survive. The Good News: There was a couple of things that stood out in this. Morty looks quite freaky. The actor did a good job of portraying the fact that he is a wooden dummy and so he couldn't walk or move like a normal person. We get stilted, almost comical, walking and movement but it's quite realistic and incredibly creepy the first time around. He doesn't say anything here either so his creepiness is enhanced by not having him turned into the wise-cracking killer he could've been. There is some effective moments of dread and suspense, especially the scenes inside the carnival ride. The designs on the statues around the walls, the darkness of the location, and the way their filmed make for some great moments. The first scare attempt, using a dummy and a pool did get a little jump out, even though it's pretty much expected, but the timing of the scene wins it out. The original premise is rife with potential and has some interesting set-ups possible that would lead to believe it had a chance. To bad it wasn't founded up as good as it could've. The Bad News: There really wasn't a whole lot of good things, which means that there must be a lot more negative aspects. It would take a lot of coffee to stay awake during the running time, as it's too long. There is way too much running around talking in this film, or unnecessary moments placed within that really test viewers patience. The film needed some livening up and death scenes usually do that, but this one cheats us out even more as most of the deaths don't happen on screen. Just before it gets ready to have someone done away with, the scene cuts to someone talking, then the dead body is found later and more talking happens. Without on screen deaths, we don't get any blood or gore either. These are all bloodless kills, leaving the gore-hound without that much to really invest in it. The chase scenes are only really spectacular due to the dummy, but beyond that, there really isn't much to them. They just sort of happen and pass over without scoring that much in the suspense department. So without action, without gore and without any true suspense, the film is pretty boring and hollow. The perfectly potential-filled plot is also wasted at times, as the kills come so late in the film half the viewers won't care, but also, as most of them were supposed to be based on fears, only a scarce few actually are. A really big cheat there, as that just opens up tons of different scenarios to work and explore, yet this one doesn't really do any of them. The Final Verdict: An interesting premise with a great killer spoiled by a long period of inactivity and not playing out the full of it's potential. Worth it mainly for those that like to get a little deeper into films, but advance with caution if you like a fast pace with lots of stuff going on. Rated R: Graphic Language, Violence, Brief Nudity, a mild sex scene and an attempted Rape

    Saw this movie the other day on SciFi Channel. The thumbnail description sounded good so I figured I'd give it a shot. Bad idea. The whole premise of the movie is a monster that capitalizes on the fears of its victims. So I was immediately skeptical when the opening credits said..."Morty" effects created by... "Morty?" Are you kidding me? If this thing is supposed to exploit fear, you've got to come to the table with a name better than "Morty." Why not just call it "Bambi" or "Winnie the Pooh?" Anyway, the movie doesn't deliver on anything else, either. It's not scary, the acting sucks, the characters are completely unlikeable, and there's almost no action to speak of in the entire flick. Bottom line, I am very glad my fantasy football draft was scheduled to begin immediately after this movie ended so I could put this train-wreck of a film out of my mind for good. Definitely deserving of the lowest possible rating.

    I finally was able to track down a copy of this movie that I haven't seen since it was first released (As always, it came from my local pawn shop) the story goes that a psychology student named RICHARD takes a group of people up to a remote cabin for the weekend to study their fears as part of a research paper he is doing, upon arriving, his girlfriend discovers a creepy wooden mannequin named MORTY stashed away, RICHARD tells them that this was in his grandfathers store when he was a kid & uses the mannequin as a means for the group to talk to, to tell about their fears, however this turns out to be a bad thing to do, because soon Morty gets up & starts using their fears against them in order to do them in & soon Richard discovers some startling revelations to many questions about his past that he never knew & what a re-curring dream is trying to tell him, Can he defeat Morty & stop these heinous killings? or will he too die to his own "Fear"? THE FEAR was a lot better than what you would expect from the usual hack n' slash thrillers about inanimate objects coming to life to do people in, instead of the usual bloodbath or Friday The 13th rip-off, it uses a unique method & idea for the killer to kill his victims with, their own deep & personal fears! there's also plenty of plot twists in the movie & some very neat & interesting revelations about the hero's past. The location where they shot the film was beautiful. The special effects zombie & Morty was also well done. The film also has some really creepy moments at times (The scene where one of the students is Possessed by Morty's spirit which then attacks Richard, is spooky & reminded me of THE EVIL DEAD) & Morty is a pretty scary looking & interesting villain. That said, the film seems to fail in other areas, much of the murders only occur in the last twenty minutes of the movie & are pretty bloodless & most of the characters are annoying & hateful, making us just wish that Morty would come to life & kill them sooner & speaking of Morty getting up & killing, he doesn't actually start to move around until the film is almost over & really that's when this movie only comes to life, since the rest of the film up until the last twenty minutes it pretty talky & how the hero's of the film deal with Morty at the climax feels like a major cheat & dampened things a little. IVAN REITMAN was given a "Special Thanks" credit at the end of the movie (I hear it was because the cabin featured in the film was his)) & WES CRAVEN (Director of SCREAM & A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET) appears in a cameo at the beginning & ending of the film as Richard's psychiatrist. All in all while the review sounds somewhat positive, I will say it wasn't mean't to be, don't get me wrong, THE FEAR has many creepy moments, but it takes far to long to get up to speed, doesn't take it's premise all the way, is burdened with mediocre acting & worse direction & by the time it's over, one can't help but feeling disappointed by what the film could have & should have been, with a story about a creepy wooden mannequin that can kill you, based on your fears, the pretty, but spooky atmosphere, none of it is handled well. In this day of endless remakes, THE FEAR could definitely benefit for one, with the right writers, producers & directors at the helm, this could so easily have been (& if remade still has the chance to be) one of the scariest horror films ever made. The DVD version is horrendously cut clocking in at an 88 minute running time & is to be avoided at all costs. If you can try & get a hold of the uncut VHS version which is how the film was really mean't to be seen. The ending also left the door wide open for a sequel, which despite getting one, seemingly bared little, to no relation to this film at all & in truth, was just a remake called THE FEAR: HALLOWEEN NIGHT PROLOX TRIVIA: Writer RON FORD later stated that he wasn't to impressed with the final project, saying that the director was to slow when filming this & that a lot of the scenes in the script failed to make it into the film. **1/2 stars

    Nice trybut that's about the only positive thing you can say about this lackluster attempt to blend psychological thriller with eerie horror monsters. The script desperately tries to be intelligent and innovating but the result is a very poor and tedious movie, even for the already low 90's standards. The story handles about an overly ambitious psychology student who motivates a clique of people to go on a mountain-weekend where he'll finish his thesis about phobias. The point is that all the participants get over their fears by talking about them and, in the meantime, our college boy can process his own childhood trauma. Upon arrival, everyone's fear comes to life in the shape of a life-size wooden dummy. Of course the puppet means trouble! It's made by Indiansit's always the Indians with their spiritual evils, I tell you!! This movie takes itself way too seriously and the makers actually seem to believe that the subject matter is deep and complex! It's not! It's more than obvious that every character hides one of several dark secrets and the viewer figures them all out long before they reveal the "truth" themselves. I've rarely seen a movie so predictable than "The Fear". The story gets more and more annoying near the end and, the more clever it tries to be, the more ridiculous it all looks. The wooden "evil personified" dummy isn't very impressive and the squeaky stretching-sounds he constantly makes aren't my idea of eerie sound effects. Pinocchio actually was a lot scarierat least he could do tricks with his nose. The acting performances are forgettable, even though I'm sure the guy who came up with the idea to offer Wes Craven a small role is very proud of himself. In case you're looking for some really unsettling evil-dummy horror movies, check out "Pin" (brilliant but disgracefully underrated 80's thriller) and "Magic" (staring a young Anthony Hopkins".

    The Fear (1995) was a total snooze fest. I saw this movie several years ago on cable t.v. For the life of me I had no idea why I even bother watching the entire movie. I never thought I would experience such a lame horror film (that was until I watched a couple of Asylum productions). The only saving grace was the attractive mail order bride from Europe that guest star Vince Edwards shared screen time with. The story (if you want to know or bothering even caring about) has something to do with a wooden statue and a psycho killer. Horror hack Wes Craven makes a cameo appearance as a doctor. Put this bad boy in your D.V.D. player. Is it so lame and offensive that'll make you want to smash your t.v. set? No, it's lame in the sense that it'll put you to sleep in no time. Just wait until the European woman makes an appearance, then you'll have something to think about when you nod off. I would have to pass on this movie and run away from it the next time I see it on the video store shelf or on t.v. Not at all recommended.

    I can't really add upon the guy above's comments except to say that this film has one moment of sheer comedy brilliance. I, like the person who wrote previously watched this film with no expectations except maybe some good "b" movie fun. the moment worth watching this film for comes towards the end.... all the moments of promise have passed and Morty is chasing a potential victim as he finally grabs hold of her he............. shakes her! i kid you not! all he can do is shake her! not bite of her face, or remove her heart and use it as a football! if you have a phobia of being shook, then stay away! If however you love a good shake and no, i don't mean porn movie style! then this just may be the movie for you.

I could go on and on with the negatives of this film, but why? It's simply horrid. I really don't know what the bottom line plot of this film is? The jump scares don't work. There's no gore. There's NO nudity. There's no graphic violence. What the hell is the point of this film? The climax is non-existent. Morty is supposed to be made of wood but looks like some ham actor in a rubber jump suit. It's really just one asinine film making error after another. Just stay away!

    "The Fear" is certainly flawed for what could've been a lot of fun. **SPOILERS** In order to get a better understanding of psychological aspects, student Richard, (Eddie Bowz) is assigned a group of students, Ashley, (Heather Medway) Troy, (Darin Heames) Gerald, (Antonio Lewis Todd) Mindy, (Monique Mannen) and tag-alongs Leslie, (Ann Turkel) and Vance Cooper, (Leland Howard III) to a cabin in the woods for an experiment on fear. As he begins his sessions, his Uncle Pete, (Vince Edwards) and daughter Tanya, (Anna Karin) show up to ask for a room for the weekend, and he takes them in on his sessions. As they start to overcome their fears one by one, they have an idea that an Indian statue is more than just that, and when it eventually is proved true, they all have to face their individual fears to survive. The Good News: There was a couple of things that stood out in this. Morty looks quite freaky. The actor did a good job of portraying the fact that he is a wooden dummy and so he couldn't walk or move like a normal person. We get stilted, almost comical, walking and movement but it's quite realistic and incredibly creepy the first time around. He doesn't say anything here either so his creepiness is enhanced by not having him turned into the wise-cracking killer he could've been. There is some effective moments of dread and suspense, especially the scenes inside the carnival ride. The designs on the statues around the walls, the darkness of the location, and the way their filmed make for some great moments. The first scare attempt, using a dummy and a pool did get a little jump out, even though it's pretty much expected, but the timing of the scene wins it out. The original premise is rife with potential and has some interesting set-ups possible that would lead to believe it had a chance. To bad it wasn't founded up as good as it could've. The Bad News: There really wasn't a whole lot of good things, which means that there must be a lot more negative aspects. It would take a lot of coffee to stay awake during the running time, as it's too long. There is way too much running around talking in this film, or unnecessary moments placed within that really test viewers patience. The film needed some livening up and death scenes usually do that, but this one cheats us out even more as most of the deaths don't happen on screen. Just before it gets ready to have someone done away with, the scene cuts to someone talking, then the dead body is found later and more talking happens. Without on screen deaths, we don't get any blood or gore either. These are all bloodless kills, leaving the gore-hound without that much to really invest in it. The chase scenes are only really spectacular due to the dummy, but beyond that, there really isn't much to them. They just sort of happen and pass over without scoring that much in the suspense department. So without action, without gore and without any true suspense, the film is pretty boring and hollow. The perfectly potential-filled plot is also wasted at times, as the kills come so late in the film half the viewers won't care, but also, as most of them were supposed to be based on fears, only a scarce few actually are. A really big cheat there, as that just opens up tons of different scenarios to work and explore, yet this one doesn't really do any of them. The Final Verdict: An interesting premise with a great killer spoiled by a long period of inactivity and not playing out the full of it's potential. Worth it mainly for those that like to get a little deeper into films, but advance with caution if you like a fast pace with lots of stuff going on. Rated R: Graphic Language, Violence, Brief Nudity, a mild sex scene and an attempted Rape

    Saw this movie the other day on SciFi Channel. The thumbnail description sounded good so I figured I'd give it a shot. Bad idea. The whole premise of the movie is a monster that capitalizes on the fears of its victims. So I was immediately skeptical when the opening credits said..."Morty" effects created by... "Morty?" Are you kidding me? If this thing is supposed to exploit fear, you've got to come to the table with a name better than "Morty." Why not just call it "Bambi" or "Winnie the Pooh?" Anyway, the movie doesn't deliver on anything else, either. It's not scary, the acting sucks, the characters are completely unlikeable, and there's almost no action to speak of in the entire flick. Bottom line, I am very glad my fantasy football draft was scheduled to begin immediately after this movie ended so I could put this train-wreck of a film out of my mind for good. Definitely deserving of the lowest possible rating.

    I finally was able to track down a copy of this movie that I haven't seen since it was first released (As always, it came from my local pawn shop) the story goes that a psychology student named RICHARD takes a group of people up to a remote cabin for the weekend to study their fears as part of a research paper he is doing, upon arriving, his girlfriend discovers a creepy wooden mannequin named MORTY stashed away, RICHARD tells them that this was in his grandfathers store when he was a kid & uses the mannequin as a means for the group to talk to, to tell about their fears, however this turns out to be a bad thing to do, because soon Morty gets up & starts using their fears against them in order to do them in & soon Richard discovers some startling revelations to many questions about his past that he never knew & what a re-curring dream is trying to tell him, Can he defeat Morty & stop these heinous killings? or will he too die to his own "Fear"? THE FEAR was a lot better than what you would expect from the usual hack n' slash thrillers about inanimate objects coming to life to do people in, instead of the usual bloodbath or Friday The 13th rip-off, it uses a unique method & idea for the killer to kill his victims with, their own deep & personal fears! there's also plenty of plot twists in the movie & some very neat & interesting revelations about the hero's past. The location where they shot the film was beautiful. The special effects zombie & Morty was also well done. The film also has some really creepy moments at times (The scene where one of the students is Possessed by Morty's spirit which then attacks Richard, is spooky & reminded me of THE EVIL DEAD) & Morty is a pretty scary looking & interesting villain. That said, the film seems to fail in other areas, much of the murders only occur in the last twenty minutes of the movie & are pretty bloodless & most of the characters are annoying & hateful, making us just wish that Morty would come to life & kill them sooner & speaking of Morty getting up & killing, he doesn't actually start to move around until the film is almost over & really that's when this movie only comes to life, since the rest of the film up until the last twenty minutes it pretty talky & how the hero's of the film deal with Morty at the climax feels like a major cheat & dampened things a little. IVAN REITMAN was given a "Special Thanks" credit at the end of the movie (I hear it was because the cabin featured in the film was his)) & WES CRAVEN (Director of SCREAM & A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET) appears in a cameo at the beginning & ending of the film as Richard's psychiatrist. All in all while the review sounds somewhat positive, I will say it wasn't mean't to be, don't get me wrong, THE FEAR has many creepy moments, but it takes far to long to get up to speed, doesn't take it's premise all the way, is burdened with mediocre acting & worse direction & by the time it's over, one can't help but feeling disappointed by what the film could have & should have been, with a story about a creepy wooden mannequin that can kill you, based on your fears, the pretty, but spooky atmosphere, none of it is handled well. In this day of endless remakes, THE FEAR could definitely benefit for one, with the right writers, producers & directors at the helm, this could so easily have been (& if remade still has the chance to be) one of the scariest horror films ever made. The DVD version is horrendously cut clocking in at an 88 minute running time & is to be avoided at all costs. If you can try & get a hold of the uncut VHS version which is how the film was really mean't to be seen. The ending also left the door wide open for a sequel, which despite getting one, seemingly bared little, to no relation to this film at all & in truth, was just a remake called THE FEAR: HALLOWEEN NIGHT PROLOX TRIVIA: Writer RON FORD later stated that he wasn't to impressed with the final project, saying that the director was to slow when filming this & that a lot of the scenes in the script failed to make it into the film. **1/2 stars

    Nice trybut that's about the only positive thing you can say about this lackluster attempt to blend psychological thriller with eerie horror monsters. The script desperately tries to be intelligent and innovating but the result is a very poor and tedious movie, even for the already low 90's standards. The story handles about an overly ambitious psychology student who motivates a clique of people to go on a mountain-weekend where he'll finish his thesis about phobias. The point is that all the participants get over their fears by talking about them and, in the meantime, our college boy can process his own childhood trauma. Upon arrival, everyone's fear comes to life in the shape of a life-size wooden dummy. Of course the puppet means trouble! It's made by Indiansit's always the Indians with their spiritual evils, I tell you!! This movie takes itself way too seriously and the makers actually seem to believe that the subject matter is deep and complex! It's not! It's more than obvious that every character hides one of several dark secrets and the viewer figures them all out long before they reveal the "truth" themselves. I've rarely seen a movie so predictable than "The Fear". The story gets more and more annoying near the end and, the more clever it tries to be, the more ridiculous it all looks. The wooden "evil personified" dummy isn't very impressive and the squeaky stretching-sounds he constantly makes aren't my idea of eerie sound effects. Pinocchio actually was a lot scarierat least he could do tricks with his nose. The acting performances are forgettable, even though I'm sure the guy who came up with the idea to offer Wes Craven a small role is very proud of himself. In case you're looking for some really unsettling evil-dummy horror movies, check out "Pin" (brilliant but disgracefully underrated 80's thriller) and "Magic" (staring a young Anthony Hopkins".

    The Fear (1995) was a total snooze fest. I saw this movie several years ago on cable t.v. For the life of me I had no idea why I even bother watching the entire movie. I never thought I would experience such a lame horror film (that was until I watched a couple of Asylum productions). The only saving grace was the attractive mail order bride from Europe that guest star Vince Edwards shared screen time with. The story (if you want to know or bothering even caring about) has something to do with a wooden statue and a psycho killer. Horror hack Wes Craven makes a cameo appearance as a doctor. Put this bad boy in your D.V.D. player. Is it so lame and offensive that'll make you want to smash your t.v. set? No, it's lame in the sense that it'll put you to sleep in no time. Just wait until the European woman makes an appearance, then you'll have something to think about when you nod off. I would have to pass on this movie and run away from it the next time I see it on the video store shelf or on t.v. Not at all recommended.

    I can't really add upon the guy above's comments except to say that this film has one moment of sheer comedy brilliance. I, like the person who wrote previously watched this film with no expectations except maybe some good "b" movie fun. the moment worth watching this film for comes towards the end.... all the moments of promise have passed and Morty is chasing a potential victim as he finally grabs hold of her he............. shakes her! i kid you not! all he can do is shake her! not bite of her face, or remove her heart and use it as a football! if you have a phobia of being shook, then stay away! If however you love a good shake and no, i don't mean porn movie style! then this just may be the movie for you.

    Richard takes a group of his friends up to a secluded cottage to discuss their fears as a part of his university report. He finds an old wooden life-size dummy which is named "Morty". It was in his family for years. Anyways, they decide to tell Morty their fears. Some of their fears include bugs, water, heights, growing old, etc. Eventually, Morty begins to pop up in places scaring the group. And it isn't long before Morty comes to life and begins killing a few of them by using their fears. There are some subplots involved in the movie such as the identity of the campus rapist. We see a woman attacked on campus by an unknown assailant and discover that someone has been raping girls at the college. It is quickly obvious that the rapist is among the group of friends. And we also follow the individual relationships between each of the couples, which are mostly dysfunctional. There is also some weird borderline incest scene which was unnecessary. A lot of it just seemed to over the place. The acting is decent enough to not ruin the movie. And there are some interesting twists regarding some of the character's pasts (especially Richard's), but the film is too all over the place. The Fear never sticks to one plot for long periods of time. We've got this wooden person roaming around, but we are also trying to figure out the identity of the campus rapist. I think The Fear would have been better if it focused more on the creepy wooden dummy Morty. It trailed off too much onto other story lines and failed to provide any scares or frightening moments. Interesting twists, but this did not scare me in the slightest which is what a horror movie should do. 4/10

    I give this movie a 10 for several reasons. The acting was excellent and the movie had the effect that a horror movie is supposed to elicit. This movie brings the same emotions to mind as if and when you have ever had a clown or some other doll sitting in your bedroom at night staring at you, only in this instance it is worse because the doll is a life-sized carved wooden effigy, kind of like a cigar-store Indian. There is subtle suspense throughout the movie, and gets delightfully worse at the end. The horror in this movie is both at times psychological(is it all in their heads?)and at other times actually happening. I recommend this movie to horror movie fans and it is a prized possession in my collection.

    This movie is seriously lacking in its one fundamental ingredient; horror. It's amazingly shocking to see what weird choices the film-makers made with this movie, that all go at the expense of the quality of the movie. The main concept and idea behind this movie certainly deserved to get a better treatment. And I also must admit that when the true horror/slasher aspects of the movie kick in, the movie is actually still quite good and enjoyable to watch. But only problem is that it isn't until the last 20 minutes or so that the movie truly becomes a slasher and 10 minutes later it has all ended again already. And what an horrible sudden ending it has. So there is actually very little to enjoy for the horror lovers among us, myself included. The movie is basically all build up and no pay off. The movie keeps dragging on with its character development and only throws in some fake scares to help you to remind that this is supposed to be an horror movie you're watching. This movie is some real wasted potential. I really liked the killer and the whole idea behind him, which makes me wish that this movie was given into the hands of someone more capable, or someone with some more experience with the genre at the very least. This was the first and only, as of yet, movie that Vincent Robert directed. Prior to this he also had very little experience with the movie making business, so why he ever was given the opportunity to directed this movie is a bit of a mystery to me. Wes Craven was in the cast, couldn't he at least had given the film-makers a couple of tips on film-making as well. The movie has a cheap video look over it but hey, that's what you get from an '90's movie. It tries to be like a good genre movie from the '80's but it basically only does this by throwing in a bunch of unlikeable persons, who are also all sleeping with each other, or at least are busy trying to. Granted that this is far from the worst thing I have ever seen but it unfortunately ain't much good, original or interesting enough either. 4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    ***Three Out of Ten Stars*** A serial killer possesses a Native American wooden statue named Morty, because the serial killer committed suicide and just cant rest! The serial killer's son convinces a bunch of his friends to spend Halloween at his grandparent's estate in the country. Their plan is to complete a ritual on Halloween night that will bring Morty, the wooden statue, to life. All of this to bring peace to the serial killer! It seems the serial killer's son instigated this activity, perhaps because he's a psycho himself? All we do know for sure is that these friends are unaware that the statue is possessed by a serial killer's spirit. What this all has to do with Halloween, I don't know. And that's why I rented the film, because I thought it had something to do with Halloween. The only thing this film has to do with Halloween is that there are some lighted pumpkins in the background, and that the events supposedly take place on Halloween night. That's one of the biggest disappointments here, the film tickets itself as a Halloween scare, but there's no feeling of Halloween whatsoever. The filmmakers clearly tacked their crappy plot onto Halloween to trick people into seeing this debacle. Wow! That's all I can say, is wow! This film is a complete disaster... I gave it every chance but it failed on every level. The only slightly redeeming quality of this film is the cinematography: There is nothing lazy about the cinematography; the shots progress rapidly and are probably the only thing that kept me from falling asleep. Besides rapid shot cuts, there's nothing redeeming in regards to the acting, directing, or plot. The sound and lighting are sufficient, but nothing to write home about. It's really frustrating, because it seems as if the filmmakers had the financial means to produce a somewhat respectable film. The basic idea of a mystical figure stalking and killing people based on their inner most fears is a great idea. Unfortunately, the filmmakers delve into ridiculous relationship sequences and obnoxious youth group gatherings that have no impact on the core story. The serial killer's son's friends have no personalities and are extremely unlikeable. Let me also mention Mitch, the douche bag boyfriend with an obviously fake English accent and the resident Native American who acts as the guardian for the wooden statue Morty for some unbeknownst reason. I could go on and on with the negatives of this film, but why? It's simply horrid. I really don't know what the bottom line plot of this film is? The jump scares don't work. There's no gore. There's NO nudity. There's no graphic violence. What the hell is the point of this film? The climax is non-existent. Morty is supposed to be made of wood but looks like some ham actor in a rubber jump suit. It's really just one asinine film making error after another. Just stay away!

The ending also left the door wide open for a sequel, which despite getting one, seemingly bared little, to no relation to this film at all & in truth, was just a remake called THE FEAR: HALLOWEEN NIGHT PROLOX TRIVIA: Writer RON FORD later stated that he wasn't to impressed with the final project, saying that the director was to slow when filming this & that a lot of the scenes in the script failed to make it into the film. **1/2 stars

    Nice trybut that's about the only positive thing you can say about this lackluster attempt to blend psychological thriller with eerie horror monsters. The script desperately tries to be intelligent and innovating but the result is a very poor and tedious movie, even for the already low 90's standards. The story handles about an overly ambitious psychology student who motivates a clique of people to go on a mountain-weekend where he'll finish his thesis about phobias. The point is that all the participants get over their fears by talking about them and, in the meantime, our college boy can process his own childhood trauma. Upon arrival, everyone's fear comes to life in the shape of a life-size wooden dummy. Of course the puppet means trouble! It's made by Indiansit's always the Indians with their spiritual evils, I tell you!! This movie takes itself way too seriously and the makers actually seem to believe that the subject matter is deep and complex! It's not! It's more than obvious that every character hides one of several dark secrets and the viewer figures them all out long before they reveal the "truth" themselves. I've rarely seen a movie so predictable than "The Fear". The story gets more and more annoying near the end and, the more clever it tries to be, the more ridiculous it all looks. The wooden "evil personified" dummy isn't very impressive and the squeaky stretching-sounds he constantly makes aren't my idea of eerie sound effects. Pinocchio actually was a lot scarierat least he could do tricks with his nose. The acting performances are forgettable, even though I'm sure the guy who came up with the idea to offer Wes Craven a small role is very proud of himself. In case you're looking for some really unsettling evil-dummy horror movies, check out "Pin" (brilliant but disgracefully underrated 80's thriller) and "Magic" (staring a young Anthony Hopkins".

    The Fear (1995) was a total snooze fest. I saw this movie several years ago on cable t.v. For the life of me I had no idea why I even bother watching the entire movie. I never thought I would experience such a lame horror film (that was until I watched a couple of Asylum productions). The only saving grace was the attractive mail order bride from Europe that guest star Vince Edwards shared screen time with. The story (if you want to know or bothering even caring about) has something to do with a wooden statue and a psycho killer. Horror hack Wes Craven makes a cameo appearance as a doctor. Put this bad boy in your D.V.D. player. Is it so lame and offensive that'll make you want to smash your t.v. set? No, it's lame in the sense that it'll put you to sleep in no time. Just wait until the European woman makes an appearance, then you'll have something to think about when you nod off. I would have to pass on this movie and run away from it the next time I see it on the video store shelf or on t.v. Not at all recommended.

    I can't really add upon the guy above's comments except to say that this film has one moment of sheer comedy brilliance. I, like the person who wrote previously watched this film with no expectations except maybe some good "b" movie fun. the moment worth watching this film for comes towards the end.... all the moments of promise have passed and Morty is chasing a potential victim as he finally grabs hold of her he............. shakes her! i kid you not! all he can do is shake her! not bite of her face, or remove her heart and use it as a football! if you have a phobia of being shook, then stay away! If however you love a good shake and no, i don't mean porn movie style! then this just may be the movie for you.

    Richard takes a group of his friends up to a secluded cottage to discuss their fears as a part of his university report. He finds an old wooden life-size dummy which is named "Morty". It was in his family for years. Anyways, they decide to tell Morty their fears. Some of their fears include bugs, water, heights, growing old, etc. Eventually, Morty begins to pop up in places scaring the group. And it isn't long before Morty comes to life and begins killing a few of them by using their fears. There are some subplots involved in the movie such as the identity of the campus rapist. We see a woman attacked on campus by an unknown assailant and discover that someone has been raping girls at the college. It is quickly obvious that the rapist is among the group of friends. And we also follow the individual relationships between each of the couples, which are mostly dysfunctional. There is also some weird borderline incest scene which was unnecessary. A lot of it just seemed to over the place. The acting is decent enough to not ruin the movie. And there are some interesting twists regarding some of the character's pasts (especially Richard's), but the film is too all over the place. The Fear never sticks to one plot for long periods of time. We've got this wooden person roaming around, but we are also trying to figure out the identity of the campus rapist. I think The Fear would have been better if it focused more on the creepy wooden dummy Morty. It trailed off too much onto other story lines and failed to provide any scares or frightening moments. Interesting twists, but this did not scare me in the slightest which is what a horror movie should do. 4/10

    I give this movie a 10 for several reasons. The acting was excellent and the movie had the effect that a horror movie is supposed to elicit. This movie brings the same emotions to mind as if and when you have ever had a clown or some other doll sitting in your bedroom at night staring at you, only in this instance it is worse because the doll is a life-sized carved wooden effigy, kind of like a cigar-store Indian. There is subtle suspense throughout the movie, and gets delightfully worse at the end. The horror in this movie is both at times psychological(is it all in their heads?)and at other times actually happening. I recommend this movie to horror movie fans and it is a prized possession in my collection.

    This movie is seriously lacking in its one fundamental ingredient; horror. It's amazingly shocking to see what weird choices the film-makers made with this movie, that all go at the expense of the quality of the movie. The main concept and idea behind this movie certainly deserved to get a better treatment. And I also must admit that when the true horror/slasher aspects of the movie kick in, the movie is actually still quite good and enjoyable to watch. But only problem is that it isn't until the last 20 minutes or so that the movie truly becomes a slasher and 10 minutes later it has all ended again already. And what an horrible sudden ending it has. So there is actually very little to enjoy for the horror lovers among us, myself included. The movie is basically all build up and no pay off. The movie keeps dragging on with its character development and only throws in some fake scares to help you to remind that this is supposed to be an horror movie you're watching. This movie is some real wasted potential. I really liked the killer and the whole idea behind him, which makes me wish that this movie was given into the hands of someone more capable, or someone with some more experience with the genre at the very least. This was the first and only, as of yet, movie that Vincent Robert directed. Prior to this he also had very little experience with the movie making business, so why he ever was given the opportunity to directed this movie is a bit of a mystery to me. Wes Craven was in the cast, couldn't he at least had given the film-makers a couple of tips on film-making as well. The movie has a cheap video look over it but hey, that's what you get from an '90's movie. It tries to be like a good genre movie from the '80's but it basically only does this by throwing in a bunch of unlikeable persons, who are also all sleeping with each other, or at least are busy trying to. Granted that this is far from the worst thing I have ever seen but it unfortunately ain't much good, original or interesting enough either. 4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    ***Three Out of Ten Stars*** A serial killer possesses a Native American wooden statue named Morty, because the serial killer committed suicide and just cant rest! The serial killer's son convinces a bunch of his friends to spend Halloween at his grandparent's estate in the country. Their plan is to complete a ritual on Halloween night that will bring Morty, the wooden statue, to life. All of this to bring peace to the serial killer! It seems the serial killer's son instigated this activity, perhaps because he's a psycho himself? All we do know for sure is that these friends are unaware that the statue is possessed by a serial killer's spirit. What this all has to do with Halloween, I don't know. And that's why I rented the film, because I thought it had something to do with Halloween. The only thing this film has to do with Halloween is that there are some lighted pumpkins in the background, and that the events supposedly take place on Halloween night. That's one of the biggest disappointments here, the film tickets itself as a Halloween scare, but there's no feeling of Halloween whatsoever. The filmmakers clearly tacked their crappy plot onto Halloween to trick people into seeing this debacle. Wow! That's all I can say, is wow! This film is a complete disaster... I gave it every chance but it failed on every level. The only slightly redeeming quality of this film is the cinematography: There is nothing lazy about the cinematography; the shots progress rapidly and are probably the only thing that kept me from falling asleep. Besides rapid shot cuts, there's nothing redeeming in regards to the acting, directing, or plot. The sound and lighting are sufficient, but nothing to write home about. It's really frustrating, because it seems as if the filmmakers had the financial means to produce a somewhat respectable film. The basic idea of a mystical figure stalking and killing people based on their inner most fears is a great idea. Unfortunately, the filmmakers delve into ridiculous relationship sequences and obnoxious youth group gatherings that have no impact on the core story. The serial killer's son's friends have no personalities and are extremely unlikeable. Let me also mention Mitch, the douche bag boyfriend with an obviously fake English accent and the resident Native American who acts as the guardian for the wooden statue Morty for some unbeknownst reason. I could go on and on with the negatives of this film, but why? It's simply horrid. I really don't know what the bottom line plot of this film is? The jump scares don't work. There's no gore. There's NO nudity. There's no graphic violence. What the hell is the point of this film? The climax is non-existent. Morty is supposed to be made of wood but looks like some ham actor in a rubber jump suit. It's really just one asinine film making error after another. Just stay away!

    "The Fear" is certainly flawed for what could've been a lot of fun. **SPOILERS** In order to get a better understanding of psychological aspects, student Richard, (Eddie Bowz) is assigned a group of students, Ashley, (Heather Medway) Troy, (Darin Heames) Gerald, (Antonio Lewis Todd) Mindy, (Monique Mannen) and tag-alongs Leslie, (Ann Turkel) and Vance Cooper, (Leland Howard III) to a cabin in the woods for an experiment on fear. As he begins his sessions, his Uncle Pete, (Vince Edwards) and daughter Tanya, (Anna Karin) show up to ask for a room for the weekend, and he takes them in on his sessions. As they start to overcome their fears one by one, they have an idea that an Indian statue is more than just that, and when it eventually is proved true, they all have to face their individual fears to survive. The Good News: There was a couple of things that stood out in this. Morty looks quite freaky. The actor did a good job of portraying the fact that he is a wooden dummy and so he couldn't walk or move like a normal person. We get stilted, almost comical, walking and movement but it's quite realistic and incredibly creepy the first time around. He doesn't say anything here either so his creepiness is enhanced by not having him turned into the wise-cracking killer he could've been. There is some effective moments of dread and suspense, especially the scenes inside the carnival ride. The designs on the statues around the walls, the darkness of the location, and the way their filmed make for some great moments. The first scare attempt, using a dummy and a pool did get a little jump out, even though it's pretty much expected, but the timing of the scene wins it out. The original premise is rife with potential and has some interesting set-ups possible that would lead to believe it had a chance. To bad it wasn't founded up as good as it could've. The Bad News: There really wasn't a whole lot of good things, which means that there must be a lot more negative aspects. It would take a lot of coffee to stay awake during the running time, as it's too long. There is way too much running around talking in this film, or unnecessary moments placed within that really test viewers patience. The film needed some livening up and death scenes usually do that, but this one cheats us out even more as most of the deaths don't happen on screen. Just before it gets ready to have someone done away with, the scene cuts to someone talking, then the dead body is found later and more talking happens. Without on screen deaths, we don't get any blood or gore either. These are all bloodless kills, leaving the gore-hound without that much to really invest in it. The chase scenes are only really spectacular due to the dummy, but beyond that, there really isn't much to them. They just sort of happen and pass over without scoring that much in the suspense department. So without action, without gore and without any true suspense, the film is pretty boring and hollow. The perfectly potential-filled plot is also wasted at times, as the kills come so late in the film half the viewers won't care, but also, as most of them were supposed to be based on fears, only a scarce few actually are. A really big cheat there, as that just opens up tons of different scenarios to work and explore, yet this one doesn't really do any of them. The Final Verdict: An interesting premise with a great killer spoiled by a long period of inactivity and not playing out the full of it's potential. Worth it mainly for those that like to get a little deeper into films, but advance with caution if you like a fast pace with lots of stuff going on. Rated R: Graphic Language, Violence, Brief Nudity, a mild sex scene and an attempted Rape

    Saw this movie the other day on SciFi Channel. The thumbnail description sounded good so I figured I'd give it a shot. Bad idea. The whole premise of the movie is a monster that capitalizes on the fears of its victims. So I was immediately skeptical when the opening credits said..."Morty" effects created by... "Morty?" Are you kidding me? If this thing is supposed to exploit fear, you've got to come to the table with a name better than "Morty." Why not just call it "Bambi" or "Winnie the Pooh?" Anyway, the movie doesn't deliver on anything else, either. It's not scary, the acting sucks, the characters are completely unlikeable, and there's almost no action to speak of in the entire flick. Bottom line, I am very glad my fantasy football draft was scheduled to begin immediately after this movie ended so I could put this train-wreck of a film out of my mind for good. Definitely deserving of the lowest possible rating.

    I finally was able to track down a copy of this movie that I haven't seen since it was first released (As always, it came from my local pawn shop) the story goes that a psychology student named RICHARD takes a group of people up to a remote cabin for the weekend to study their fears as part of a research paper he is doing, upon arriving, his girlfriend discovers a creepy wooden mannequin named MORTY stashed away, RICHARD tells them that this was in his grandfathers store when he was a kid & uses the mannequin as a means for the group to talk to, to tell about their fears, however this turns out to be a bad thing to do, because soon Morty gets up & starts using their fears against them in order to do them in & soon Richard discovers some startling revelations to many questions about his past that he never knew & what a re-curring dream is trying to tell him, Can he defeat Morty & stop these heinous killings? or will he too die to his own "Fear"? THE FEAR was a lot better than what you would expect from the usual hack n' slash thrillers about inanimate objects coming to life to do people in, instead of the usual bloodbath or Friday The 13th rip-off, it uses a unique method & idea for the killer to kill his victims with, their own deep & personal fears! there's also plenty of plot twists in the movie & some very neat & interesting revelations about the hero's past. The location where they shot the film was beautiful. The special effects zombie & Morty was also well done. The film also has some really creepy moments at times (The scene where one of the students is Possessed by Morty's spirit which then attacks Richard, is spooky & reminded me of THE EVIL DEAD) & Morty is a pretty scary looking & interesting villain. That said, the film seems to fail in other areas, much of the murders only occur in the last twenty minutes of the movie & are pretty bloodless & most of the characters are annoying & hateful, making us just wish that Morty would come to life & kill them sooner & speaking of Morty getting up & killing, he doesn't actually start to move around until the film is almost over & really that's when this movie only comes to life, since the rest of the film up until the last twenty minutes it pretty talky & how the hero's of the film deal with Morty at the climax feels like a major cheat & dampened things a little. IVAN REITMAN was given a "Special Thanks" credit at the end of the movie (I hear it was because the cabin featured in the film was his)) & WES CRAVEN (Director of SCREAM & A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET) appears in a cameo at the beginning & ending of the film as Richard's psychiatrist. All in all while the review sounds somewhat positive, I will say it wasn't mean't to be, don't get me wrong, THE FEAR has many creepy moments, but it takes far to long to get up to speed, doesn't take it's premise all the way, is burdened with mediocre acting & worse direction & by the time it's over, one can't help but feeling disappointed by what the film could have & should have been, with a story about a creepy wooden mannequin that can kill you, based on your fears, the pretty, but spooky atmosphere, none of it is handled well. In this day of endless remakes, THE FEAR could definitely benefit for one, with the right writers, producers & directors at the helm, this could so easily have been (& if remade still has the chance to be) one of the scariest horror films ever made. The DVD version is horrendously cut clocking in at an 88 minute running time & is to be avoided at all costs. If you can try & get a hold of the uncut VHS version which is how the film was really mean't to be seen. The ending also left the door wide open for a sequel, which despite getting one, seemingly bared little, to no relation to this film at all & in truth, was just a remake called THE FEAR: HALLOWEEN NIGHT PROLOX TRIVIA: Writer RON FORD later stated that he wasn't to impressed with the final project, saying that the director was to slow when filming this & that a lot of the scenes in the script failed to make it into the film. **1/2 stars
