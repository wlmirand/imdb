    "So Dear to My Heart" is the sort of unabashed bit of schmaltz that Disney did very well and which you would never see today. It's pure Americana--the sort of perfectly groomed and manicured America that Walt Disney himself wanted to promote--and which he later promoted with Disneyland and Disneyworld. It represents a look at a time and place that isn't realistic--it's more hyper-idealized and sweet--and it's pure nostalgia. Some might balk at this sort of thing--I felt like it was an incredibly sweet film. The story is about a boy (Bobby Discoll) and his pet lamb. It's also a parable about hard work, determination and good old fashioned values. And, it culminates with the lamb going to the county fair. When the film was tested, audiences didn't like that there was no animation as they expected animation in a Disney film. I really do NOT think it was needed and the animated sequences are completely unnecessary for the film, though they have a certain charm. I think they weren't needed because the film had so much going for it already--great acting by Driscoll (a very talented child actor), Beulah Bondi and Burl Ives, some AMAZING cinematography (with amazing shots of forests and meadows) and a nice but very simple script. It's a great film for kids--especially because of its healthy messages and an unusually strong religious message for a Disney film. Well worth seeing for all ages.

    So Dear To My Heart is a Disney movie often easily forgotten when considering the vast selection of better movies to choose from. It's a slice of apple pie Americana, a schmaltzy tale that tries to mix that standard Disney magic with some of The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer. Yet, despite my cynicism and the way I often dislike this kind of thing, I couldn't help liking it. I won't rush to watch it again and I wouldn't recommend it to others but I liked it for what it was - adequate Sunday afternoon viewing material on a par with Little House On The Prairie. Young Bobby Driscoll plays Jeremiah Kincaid, a good boy at heart who gets himself in trouble when he starts looking after a newborn black lamb (destined to grow into the unwanted black sheep, literally). Jeremiah upsets his gran (played by Beulah Bondi) but has an ally in the shape of Uncle Hiram Douglas (Burl Ives) while he tries to gain a trip to the county fair. Directed by Harold Schuster and Hamilton Luske, So Dear To My Heart is the movie equivalent of a weekend spent at an olde world American experience. The steam train that passes by, only occasionally stopping, the local store containing anything and everything, the farmland life and the general "gee willikers" atmosphere of it all. You want to wander on screen and explore the area while chewing a strand of straw. No, really. But the fact is that the movie presents this bygone world in such an innocent and straightforward manner that it's hard to dislike. The whole thing may be a confection overloaded with sugar but it IS an era from a bygone age and you can't watch it without feeling just the smallest pang of remorse, a small regret that life just couldn't stay that simple and carefree for all of us. There are many writers involved, adapting a novel by Sterling North, but this isn't a movie to be appreciated for the dialogue. I can't even say that it's a movie to be appreciated for the acting - Burl Ives comes out of it the best but a lot of the other performances are quite poor. No, this is a movie all about thinking back to your childhood and then rewriting it to fit in with what's on screen. I grew up a world away from the environment shown here but there are moments that remain the same in any childhood, that sense of striving to achieve something that you're too young to know could well be impossible, that naive belief that everything will always work out somehow. Which is why So Dear To My Heart is still surprisingly enjoyable if you keep those childhood experiences in mind.

    'So Dear To My Heart' was one of Walt Disney's personal favorites and it happens to be one of my favorite Disney classics as well as one of my favorite films in cinema in general. as far as Hollywood filmmaking goes in particular, it's one of the very best products they have ever manufactured. it has a heartfelt sincerity and genuineness that is exceptionally rare. even in this kind of sentimentalized nostalgia, sentiment can often end up as a maudlin mix of syrupy, overwrought contrivance and recollections that are overly idealized. not here. everything is fashioned to matter of fact perfection without dismissing the power of feeling or emotional responses. this is a example of superior craftsmanship. not only in it's beautiful Technicolor photography and rural panorama, it has set direction that details authenticity and features some of Disney's best and most attractive animation from the 1940's. the old steam trains and general stores, the horses and cows grazing in meadows, the nostalgia of the old time state fairs and of it's accurate depiction of American rural farm life, all of it depicted with such warmth and loving perfection that has few equals. even in a time period where there were so many films that attempted to do this kind of thing. but few with such real success as this film. the performances are charming and cosy, as is the case with the honest, unaffectedness of Burl Ives singing, and the children (Disney child stars Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten) are believable rather than molded facsimiles of a idealized childhood. but for me, the core performance here is the eternal sagacity of Beulah Bondi's grandmother. she is essence itself. essence of life, love, and femininity that evokes not only motherliness and age, but also a girlishness when being flirtatious with a much younger Ives when they dance to "krick-it-on-da-fryun pan ya'll'. Beulah Bondi's spirituality, as she interprets through rural American Christianity, is often really more pragmatic than anything too ethereal. often what she interprets as the ways of the Lord are simply common sense observations. Bondi's granny character often gets taxed or irritably preachy when pushed, but she never seems cruel or arrogant. Bondi's performance is one of my very favorite Hollywood film performances and something the Academy Awards neglectfully overlooked. what i like so much about this dear little film, is that it's cosy sweetness is for real and not something that the viewer is manipulated, sold or forced into. in troubled times it's often hard to believe that anyone in America ever lived or thought like this, but believe it or not it's very true and accurate. there are such a thing as simpler times. many of us are never born into them but they do exist. any real study of American history will verify that statement and the accuracy of this film's assertions. for me personally, cinema is rarely finer than this. and it's the genuine article. it's a film not about magical or super power humans, but real life people coping with everyday understandings we often all share together. it's also about our dreams that occur in the earthy, everyday reality and how they manifest realistically and practically, with advice, a little "stick-to-it-ivity" and a humble understanding of what you've got. God Bless. may you find peace with the Lord.

    I'm sure that everyone who loves this film agrees that its title is exactly how they feel about it. And so do I. It really becomes very dear to the heart. Unfortunately it is very injusticed for being extremely difficult to find, even almost impossible. An insane amount of luck is necessary to find this movie and apparently it is ridiculously expensive, which only will scare off potential buyers. Consider yourself lucky if you find a copy of this for a good price. 'So Dear To My Heart' follows the basic formula of 'Song of the South': live-action and animation combined, the similar scenario and environment, the same two charming children (Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten). By taking inspiration on 'Song of the South', they made a better 'Song of the South' out of it. This film is gold! It's so sweet, endearing, innocent, immensely enchanting and oh so beautiful! It's made with dedication and values. It's perfect in every way. The whole thing is adorable. It doesn't have too much songs, which is a good thing. The few songs it has are very simple and may not be the most memorable Disney songs, but they eventually grown on us. The 2 kids were and will always be 2 of the most charismatic Disney child stars ever. They always had a perfect chemistry in everything they did together and they had a gift for acting. They bring such joy and tenderness to the movie, a real feeling of the age of innocence to it. The adults (Beulah Bondi and Burl Ives) are excellent. The movie has lots of fun and classic humor and at the same time it teaches good values which sadly seem to mean nothing anymore for this generation and society without values, without color, without soul... Disney's films in general of nowadays pale behind treasures like this. Whatever happened to good old Disney? This is from a time when Disney was really Disney. Nowadays's Disney is not worthy of the prestigious Disney name. Not by shadows! I don't think anybody who was involved in this film is alive, but wherever they are they must be ashamed of what Disney has become and at the same time proud of having been part of something really good as this. This should definitely be on Top 250.

    The title matches my feelings about it: indeed it is so dear to my heart. This is one of those early Disney classics which mix live-action and animation. It's a relic, one of those cinema pearls incredibly difficult to find and almost completely forgotten today. Which is a shame. It really is a fine little film. A small Disney masterpiece. I can even use the old-fashioned but charming exclamation of surprise &laquo;Gee whiz&raquo; to describe it. &laquo;Gee whiz&raquo; was probably Bobby Driscoll's favorite saying, as he often used this phrase in his films. They don't make anything like this nowadays. This is from a time when films were made with love, art and talent. Now the priority is purely to profit, with no real quality, no real talent and sadistic humor. Made shortly after 'Song of the South', has evident similarities with that one. Like that one, it mixes live-action and cartoons and has the same couple of children: the unforgettable Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten. Another thing in common is the beauty of sceneries and locations, all in a big farm and they're about farm life. On the other hand, I can see that the famous 1995 film 'Babe' got some of its inspiration from 'So Dear To My Heart'. Now, as for the comparison between 'Song of the South' and 'So Dear To My Heart', which one is the better film? 'Song of the South' is good, but 'So Dear To My Heart' is the winner to me. The 4 main actors are excellent: Bobby Driscoll as Jeremiah Kincaid, Luana Patten as Tildy, Beulah Bondi as Jeremiah's loving grandmother but serious Granny Kincaid and Burl Ives as Uncle Hiram Douglas. The narrator does a wonderful job too. Oh yes, I can also mention the black lamb that portrays Danny: a fine animal actor, even though it might sound a little strange to say this. Danny the lamb is quite an extraordinary creature, to say the least. Danny is completely hilarious whenever he runs and causes mess and Jeremiah runs after him and tries to stop him. So, this film takes place in the early 20th century (in the year 1903, to be exact). It is basically the tale of Jeremiah and his love for his lamb Danny, being also a very educative film that teaches some culture and some good messages. Both the live-action and the animation look beautiful, pure, colorful, alive, artistic and magical. This and 'The Window' from 1949 are both masterpieces with the great Bobby Driscoll. Title in Portugal: 'T&atilde;o Perto do Cora&ccedil;&atilde;o'.

    One of the most enduring products from the Magic Kingdom is So Dear To My Heart still retains its charm after 62 years. It's a very simple story about a young lad trying to earn enough money to get to the Pike County Fair at the turn of the last century. Young Bobby Driscoll aided and abetted by Luana Patten wants to get his lamb Danny to the County Fair and get awarded the first prize. Young Danny came by his name because of a passing visit to their town of the Great Dan Patch legendary trotting horse champion from back in those days. He is literally the black sheep of the family with a fine coat of black wool. He also has no pedigree to speak of and that's important in these county fair events. Still Driscoll is full of hope. He also has to convince is grandmother/guardian Beulah Bondi, a kindly and pious woman who's not really into wasting money on frivolities. For that the kids rely on Burl Ives, village blacksmith with a continual song for all occasions. This film marked the farewell performance of Harry Carey who has a small role as the judge at the County Fair. So Dear To My Heart features a nice musical score by Elliot Daniel and Hy Morey which includes the Oscar nominated Lavendar Blue which Burl Ives delivers in a straightforward style. The song lost however to Baby It's Cold Outside from Neptune's Daughter. The ensemble cast is great, especially the kids. Hard to believe what eventually happened with Bobby Driscoll, he looks so innocent here. Still that's the power of film, to freeze time and images that were more favorable. After 62 years a great family film.

    So Dear To My Heart is an immensely charming live-action Dsiney film, but sadly it is overlooked. Same with Song of the South, and that was great too. I will say that asides from seeing it twice when I was 10, I didn't see this wonderful film til recently, and boy I am glad I did. It has a lot of charm, that makes it a genuine joy to watch. Considering that it was made in 1949, it looks beautiful, and I loved the animated sequences, especially with the scholarly owl. The songs are beautiful, from the stunning title song So Dear To My Heart, the charming Lavender Blue, the rousing Oodalay to the triumphant historical song with figures such as Christopher Colombus. The performances were great, with Bobby Driscoll very convincing as Jeremiah, and Beulah Bondi superb as his grandmother and Burl Ives appealing as Uncle Hiram. Danny, the neglected lamb was absolutely adorable, and Jeremiah was very loving towards him. The dialogue wasn't so bad either. So Dear to My Heart shouldn't be overlooked as a bittersweet kids film, instead it should be recognised as a charming film for the whole family, for that is exactly what it is. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    The title of this motion picture is just how I feel about it. It is "So Dear To My Heart". This film is easily my most-favorite motion picture. Some may feel the theme of "It's What You Do With What You Got" is out-dated or otherwise not applicable to current times. To me, nothing is further from the truth. The dream of a young man to achieve with what he is given, no matter the odds or the obstacles, is as current now as when this film was made or even from the year it is supposed to be from (1903). With the animated portions showing life's simple truths and how others in history have overcome long odds, the viewer can find room for its use in his/her own life. I feel that will always be true.

    This film was another opportunity to see the talented Bobby Driscoll(possibly the best child actor of all time) and Luana Patten(the epitome of feminine demureness and modesty in a child actress). Although not as good overall as The Song of the South, which featured Driscoll and Patten at a younger age, this film celebrates the anglo-protestant core of America, and the honesty and religious values of America's past before Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson launched us on the road to empire-a road Americans never wanted to travel. The animated beginning is poignant, and the Christian faith that unselfconciously permeates the film portray America's rural past as an idyll, The cast is superb-Harry Carey captures perfectly the kindly rectitude of an older generation of Americans as the chief livestock judge at the county fair-he has the air of a stern but insightful church deacon, touched by and concerned with rewarding the virtues he sees in the emerging generation of his day. Beulah Bondi is superb as the stern but wise and loving grandmother. Each of the adults, even Uncle Hiram(Burl Ives) show a commendable concern for the children, providing not only for their safety but protecting their souls as well. What a wonderful world we once had!

    Like other Disney's films, simplicity is the support of an intense message about life.I think this old movie would be seen by today's children, considering the actual tendency to loose essential valors and go on the fantastic ways, putting wonder-workers and extraordinary actions on service of something in the antipodes of the day by day. This movie is today more important than it was in 1948. Then it was a poetic image of real life and real valors. Today it proposes the recuperation of a lost paradise. But the real paradise built by man's inside.Yonder postures and feelings, the music represents, per sea,the right sonorous image of life equilibrium:support,tenderness and peace. Remains of a lost paradise is, today and by me, the true sense of this great Walt Disney's film.

    The title matches my feelings about it: indeed it is so dear to my heart. This is one of those early Disney classics which mix live-action and animation. It's a relic, one of those cinema pearls incredibly difficult to find and almost completely forgotten today. Which is a shame. It really is a fine little film. A small Disney masterpiece. I can even use the old-fashioned but charming exclamation of surprise &laquo;Gee whiz&raquo; to describe it. &laquo;Gee whiz&raquo; was probably Bobby Driscoll's favorite saying, as he often used this phrase in his films. They don't make anything like this nowadays. This is from a time when films were made with love, art and talent. Now the priority is purely to profit, with no real quality, no real talent and sadistic humor. Made shortly after 'Song of the South', has evident similarities with that one. Like that one, it mixes live-action and cartoons and has the same couple of children: the unforgettable Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten. Another thing in common is the beauty of sceneries and locations, all in a big farm and they're about farm life. On the other hand, I can see that the famous 1995 film 'Babe' got some of its inspiration from 'So Dear To My Heart'. Now, as for the comparison between 'Song of the South' and 'So Dear To My Heart', which one is the better film? 'Song of the South' is good, but 'So Dear To My Heart' is the winner to me. The 4 main actors are excellent: Bobby Driscoll as Jeremiah Kincaid, Luana Patten as Tildy, Beulah Bondi as Jeremiah's loving grandmother but serious Granny Kincaid and Burl Ives as Uncle Hiram Douglas. The narrator does a wonderful job too. Oh yes, I can also mention the black lamb that portrays Danny: a fine animal actor, even though it might sound a little strange to say this. Danny the lamb is quite an extraordinary creature, to say the least. Danny is completely hilarious whenever he runs and causes mess and Jeremiah runs after him and tries to stop him. So, this film takes place in the early 20th century (in the year 1903, to be exact). It is basically the tale of Jeremiah and his love for his lamb Danny, being also a very educative film that teaches some culture and some good messages. Both the live-action and the animation look beautiful, pure, colorful, alive, artistic and magical. This and 'The Window' from 1949 are both masterpieces with the great Bobby Driscoll. Title in Portugal: 'T&atilde;o Perto do Cora&ccedil;&atilde;o'.

    One of the most enduring products from the Magic Kingdom is So Dear To My Heart still retains its charm after 62 years. It's a very simple story about a young lad trying to earn enough money to get to the Pike County Fair at the turn of the last century. Young Bobby Driscoll aided and abetted by Luana Patten wants to get his lamb Danny to the County Fair and get awarded the first prize. Young Danny came by his name because of a passing visit to their town of the Great Dan Patch legendary trotting horse champion from back in those days. He is literally the black sheep of the family with a fine coat of black wool. He also has no pedigree to speak of and that's important in these county fair events. Still Driscoll is full of hope. He also has to convince is grandmother/guardian Beulah Bondi, a kindly and pious woman who's not really into wasting money on frivolities. For that the kids rely on Burl Ives, village blacksmith with a continual song for all occasions. This film marked the farewell performance of Harry Carey who has a small role as the judge at the County Fair. So Dear To My Heart features a nice musical score by Elliot Daniel and Hy Morey which includes the Oscar nominated Lavendar Blue which Burl Ives delivers in a straightforward style. The song lost however to Baby It's Cold Outside from Neptune's Daughter. The ensemble cast is great, especially the kids. Hard to believe what eventually happened with Bobby Driscoll, he looks so innocent here. Still that's the power of film, to freeze time and images that were more favorable. After 62 years a great family film.

    So Dear To My Heart is an immensely charming live-action Dsiney film, but sadly it is overlooked. Same with Song of the South, and that was great too. I will say that asides from seeing it twice when I was 10, I didn't see this wonderful film til recently, and boy I am glad I did. It has a lot of charm, that makes it a genuine joy to watch. Considering that it was made in 1949, it looks beautiful, and I loved the animated sequences, especially with the scholarly owl. The songs are beautiful, from the stunning title song So Dear To My Heart, the charming Lavender Blue, the rousing Oodalay to the triumphant historical song with figures such as Christopher Colombus. The performances were great, with Bobby Driscoll very convincing as Jeremiah, and Beulah Bondi superb as his grandmother and Burl Ives appealing as Uncle Hiram. Danny, the neglected lamb was absolutely adorable, and Jeremiah was very loving towards him. The dialogue wasn't so bad either. So Dear to My Heart shouldn't be overlooked as a bittersweet kids film, instead it should be recognised as a charming film for the whole family, for that is exactly what it is. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    The title of this motion picture is just how I feel about it. It is "So Dear To My Heart". This film is easily my most-favorite motion picture. Some may feel the theme of "It's What You Do With What You Got" is out-dated or otherwise not applicable to current times. To me, nothing is further from the truth. The dream of a young man to achieve with what he is given, no matter the odds or the obstacles, is as current now as when this film was made or even from the year it is supposed to be from (1903). With the animated portions showing life's simple truths and how others in history have overcome long odds, the viewer can find room for its use in his/her own life. I feel that will always be true.

    This film was another opportunity to see the talented Bobby Driscoll(possibly the best child actor of all time) and Luana Patten(the epitome of feminine demureness and modesty in a child actress). Although not as good overall as The Song of the South, which featured Driscoll and Patten at a younger age, this film celebrates the anglo-protestant core of America, and the honesty and religious values of America's past before Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson launched us on the road to empire-a road Americans never wanted to travel. The animated beginning is poignant, and the Christian faith that unselfconciously permeates the film portray America's rural past as an idyll, The cast is superb-Harry Carey captures perfectly the kindly rectitude of an older generation of Americans as the chief livestock judge at the county fair-he has the air of a stern but insightful church deacon, touched by and concerned with rewarding the virtues he sees in the emerging generation of his day. Beulah Bondi is superb as the stern but wise and loving grandmother. Each of the adults, even Uncle Hiram(Burl Ives) show a commendable concern for the children, providing not only for their safety but protecting their souls as well. What a wonderful world we once had!

    Like other Disney's films, simplicity is the support of an intense message about life.I think this old movie would be seen by today's children, considering the actual tendency to loose essential valors and go on the fantastic ways, putting wonder-workers and extraordinary actions on service of something in the antipodes of the day by day. This movie is today more important than it was in 1948. Then it was a poetic image of real life and real valors. Today it proposes the recuperation of a lost paradise. But the real paradise built by man's inside.Yonder postures and feelings, the music represents, per sea,the right sonorous image of life equilibrium:support,tenderness and peace. Remains of a lost paradise is, today and by me, the true sense of this great Walt Disney's film.

    "So Dear to My Heart" is the sort of unabashed bit of schmaltz that Disney did very well and which you would never see today. It's pure Americana--the sort of perfectly groomed and manicured America that Walt Disney himself wanted to promote--and which he later promoted with Disneyland and Disneyworld. It represents a look at a time and place that isn't realistic--it's more hyper-idealized and sweet--and it's pure nostalgia. Some might balk at this sort of thing--I felt like it was an incredibly sweet film. The story is about a boy (Bobby Discoll) and his pet lamb. It's also a parable about hard work, determination and good old fashioned values. And, it culminates with the lamb going to the county fair. When the film was tested, audiences didn't like that there was no animation as they expected animation in a Disney film. I really do NOT think it was needed and the animated sequences are completely unnecessary for the film, though they have a certain charm. I think they weren't needed because the film had so much going for it already--great acting by Driscoll (a very talented child actor), Beulah Bondi and Burl Ives, some AMAZING cinematography (with amazing shots of forests and meadows) and a nice but very simple script. It's a great film for kids--especially because of its healthy messages and an unusually strong religious message for a Disney film. Well worth seeing for all ages.

    So Dear To My Heart is a Disney movie often easily forgotten when considering the vast selection of better movies to choose from. It's a slice of apple pie Americana, a schmaltzy tale that tries to mix that standard Disney magic with some of The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer. Yet, despite my cynicism and the way I often dislike this kind of thing, I couldn't help liking it. I won't rush to watch it again and I wouldn't recommend it to others but I liked it for what it was - adequate Sunday afternoon viewing material on a par with Little House On The Prairie. Young Bobby Driscoll plays Jeremiah Kincaid, a good boy at heart who gets himself in trouble when he starts looking after a newborn black lamb (destined to grow into the unwanted black sheep, literally). Jeremiah upsets his gran (played by Beulah Bondi) but has an ally in the shape of Uncle Hiram Douglas (Burl Ives) while he tries to gain a trip to the county fair. Directed by Harold Schuster and Hamilton Luske, So Dear To My Heart is the movie equivalent of a weekend spent at an olde world American experience. The steam train that passes by, only occasionally stopping, the local store containing anything and everything, the farmland life and the general "gee willikers" atmosphere of it all. You want to wander on screen and explore the area while chewing a strand of straw. No, really. But the fact is that the movie presents this bygone world in such an innocent and straightforward manner that it's hard to dislike. The whole thing may be a confection overloaded with sugar but it IS an era from a bygone age and you can't watch it without feeling just the smallest pang of remorse, a small regret that life just couldn't stay that simple and carefree for all of us. There are many writers involved, adapting a novel by Sterling North, but this isn't a movie to be appreciated for the dialogue. I can't even say that it's a movie to be appreciated for the acting - Burl Ives comes out of it the best but a lot of the other performances are quite poor. No, this is a movie all about thinking back to your childhood and then rewriting it to fit in with what's on screen. I grew up a world away from the environment shown here but there are moments that remain the same in any childhood, that sense of striving to achieve something that you're too young to know could well be impossible, that naive belief that everything will always work out somehow. Which is why So Dear To My Heart is still surprisingly enjoyable if you keep those childhood experiences in mind.

    'So Dear To My Heart' was one of Walt Disney's personal favorites and it happens to be one of my favorite Disney classics as well as one of my favorite films in cinema in general. as far as Hollywood filmmaking goes in particular, it's one of the very best products they have ever manufactured. it has a heartfelt sincerity and genuineness that is exceptionally rare. even in this kind of sentimentalized nostalgia, sentiment can often end up as a maudlin mix of syrupy, overwrought contrivance and recollections that are overly idealized. not here. everything is fashioned to matter of fact perfection without dismissing the power of feeling or emotional responses. this is a example of superior craftsmanship. not only in it's beautiful Technicolor photography and rural panorama, it has set direction that details authenticity and features some of Disney's best and most attractive animation from the 1940's. the old steam trains and general stores, the horses and cows grazing in meadows, the nostalgia of the old time state fairs and of it's accurate depiction of American rural farm life, all of it depicted with such warmth and loving perfection that has few equals. even in a time period where there were so many films that attempted to do this kind of thing. but few with such real success as this film. the performances are charming and cosy, as is the case with the honest, unaffectedness of Burl Ives singing, and the children (Disney child stars Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten) are believable rather than molded facsimiles of a idealized childhood. but for me, the core performance here is the eternal sagacity of Beulah Bondi's grandmother. she is essence itself. essence of life, love, and femininity that evokes not only motherliness and age, but also a girlishness when being flirtatious with a much younger Ives when they dance to "krick-it-on-da-fryun pan ya'll'. Beulah Bondi's spirituality, as she interprets through rural American Christianity, is often really more pragmatic than anything too ethereal. often what she interprets as the ways of the Lord are simply common sense observations. Bondi's granny character often gets taxed or irritably preachy when pushed, but she never seems cruel or arrogant. Bondi's performance is one of my very favorite Hollywood film performances and something the Academy Awards neglectfully overlooked. what i like so much about this dear little film, is that it's cosy sweetness is for real and not something that the viewer is manipulated, sold or forced into. in troubled times it's often hard to believe that anyone in America ever lived or thought like this, but believe it or not it's very true and accurate. there are such a thing as simpler times. many of us are never born into them but they do exist. any real study of American history will verify that statement and the accuracy of this film's assertions. for me personally, cinema is rarely finer than this. and it's the genuine article. it's a film not about magical or super power humans, but real life people coping with everyday understandings we often all share together. it's also about our dreams that occur in the earthy, everyday reality and how they manifest realistically and practically, with advice, a little "stick-to-it-ivity" and a humble understanding of what you've got. God Bless. may you find peace with the Lord.

    I'm sure that everyone who loves this film agrees that its title is exactly how they feel about it. And so do I. It really becomes very dear to the heart. Unfortunately it is very injusticed for being extremely difficult to find, even almost impossible. An insane amount of luck is necessary to find this movie and apparently it is ridiculously expensive, which only will scare off potential buyers. Consider yourself lucky if you find a copy of this for a good price. 'So Dear To My Heart' follows the basic formula of 'Song of the South': live-action and animation combined, the similar scenario and environment, the same two charming children (Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten). By taking inspiration on 'Song of the South', they made a better 'Song of the South' out of it. This film is gold! It's so sweet, endearing, innocent, immensely enchanting and oh so beautiful! It's made with dedication and values. It's perfect in every way. The whole thing is adorable. It doesn't have too much songs, which is a good thing. The few songs it has are very simple and may not be the most memorable Disney songs, but they eventually grown on us. The 2 kids were and will always be 2 of the most charismatic Disney child stars ever. They always had a perfect chemistry in everything they did together and they had a gift for acting. They bring such joy and tenderness to the movie, a real feeling of the age of innocence to it. The adults (Beulah Bondi and Burl Ives) are excellent. The movie has lots of fun and classic humor and at the same time it teaches good values which sadly seem to mean nothing anymore for this generation and society without values, without color, without soul... Disney's films in general of nowadays pale behind treasures like this. Whatever happened to good old Disney? This is from a time when Disney was really Disney. Nowadays's Disney is not worthy of the prestigious Disney name. Not by shadows! I don't think anybody who was involved in this film is alive, but wherever they are they must be ashamed of what Disney has become and at the same time proud of having been part of something really good as this. This should definitely be on Top 250.

    One of the most enduring products from the Magic Kingdom is So Dear To My Heart still retains its charm after 62 years. It's a very simple story about a young lad trying to earn enough money to get to the Pike County Fair at the turn of the last century. Young Bobby Driscoll aided and abetted by Luana Patten wants to get his lamb Danny to the County Fair and get awarded the first prize. Young Danny came by his name because of a passing visit to their town of the Great Dan Patch legendary trotting horse champion from back in those days. He is literally the black sheep of the family with a fine coat of black wool. He also has no pedigree to speak of and that's important in these county fair events. Still Driscoll is full of hope. He also has to convince is grandmother/guardian Beulah Bondi, a kindly and pious woman who's not really into wasting money on frivolities.
