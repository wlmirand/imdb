    I use to read some of the reviews before i write my own.That's because i want to have in mind several opinions.If you do this yourselves you will understand quickly that this movie is one of the most controversial. If you have checked my rating(which is quite possible) you will have already understood that i belong to the lovers of this movie and i don't believe that you will find many in the middle.I mean this movie is made to separate people into two contradicting sides.So i ain't gonna explain why i liked it so much....what i am gonna do is to fight the opposite side,always with good intentions... I don't believe that the point of the movie is to show two psychopaths serial killers and their daily routine, but, firstly, to make clear that mass media have chosen such subjects to attract viewers. The main point of the movie is blatant.In every second we can see that mass media,TV mostly,are the "third eye" through that,sometimes, a person see the world.For example if somebody make love with a woman or man what his/her third eye does is to make he/she see porn or beautiful sex scenes from his/her favorite TV series or rocky balboa making love his sexy wife and i don't know what else and that's media content.The main point is that one of the most important sources of association of ideas is mass media(TV mostly)and media needs characters that will attract and allure the viewers such as two natural born killers. In this movie these associations of ideas are shown through the Knox couple whose minds are already harmed from their childhood and the only thing that they get in return is "information".The information that TV gives which make them go nuts.They know that their new parents are mass media and they finally get to understand that media is not that better than their previous parents. I believe that oliver stone didn't want to underestimate common people and make two psychopaths look better but to show that these two psychopaths are partially a national product and this product has the support of justice ,science and government in order to stay active and profitable.

    At the top of my list of worst movie ever seen. If someone asked me what's the worst movie you have ever seen without doubt this twisted, sick, worthless piece of crap movie comes to my mind first. I don't know what the director of this movie was thinking of himself when he made this utterly disgraceful movie. IMDb's rating encouraged me to watch this crap (cant actually call it a movie), after watching it I wonder how it got that much rating. I cannot believe people actually like this worthless video of nothing but violence all the way. The story writer and director must be as crazy as the protagonist. The advice for those who own the DVD of this crap is to shred them to as many pieces as possible and for those planning to watch it should think about the most awful movie they have ever seen and believe me this loathsome video is gonna replace that spot. Conclusion--- This is awful,loathsome,repulsive,disgusting---(you can add all the other words in dictionary which mean worthless and unimaginably terrible). That's why it doesn't even deserve a single second of your life. !!!! WARNING!!! SO DON'T BE FOOLED By ITS RATING, please.

    This is not the movie for an average American , who sit watching sitcoms all day . This is a movie about the mind of a killer , this is a very serious and poignant view into the brain of a mad people who live in this world , most Americans can not comprehend how the mind of the killer works , but Hitler and Stalin were just like that , they loved their ideas , and by killing innocent people they were elevated into belief that they were above average person , Mickey tells it exactly how it feels , he thinks he is above everyone , because he can kill . I can understand why so many Americans hate this movie , because it shows how media glorify violence , and show it all the time to gain viewing from everybody . Wake up people , this not a lie , this is not even close to real life madness and murder , This is happening all over the world , don't you remember WTC ? videos of cutting the heads of the body by al kaida ? tortures in Guantanamo? Drug wars in Mexico? This movie is nothing compared to violence going on everyday on this planet.

    Fear and Loathing seems bland in comparison. If I could only watch ten DVDs for the rest of time, this would be one of them. Oliver Stone did something with NBK that I hadn't seen since (and still haven't since). Not only is it well made but the actors act (strange, I know). It truly is a visionary achievement (well, let's face it with a story from Tarantino it was never going to be simple), it's use of colour, opposing styles and iconography, throughout, make it impossible to ignore. Okay, granted it IS ridiculous but it's that special kind of ridiculous, the "f*ck it, we're here now, might as well" kind, and it gets me every time. I won't spoil it or give you the story: just prepare yourselves for a masterclass in true cinema. It wouldn't suit any other style, I can't imagine it being shown in any other way. Mickey and Mallory remain one of the greatest screen pairings of all time (the same to be said for Lewis and Harrelson), badder than Beatrix and Bill, cooler than Trinity and Neo. It's fast, it's vicious but it NEVER lets your eyes wander away. A gripping story throughout. But if you like your bones white and your coffee black and your tie in the centre of your suit; this isn't for you.

    The most surprising thing about 'Natural Born Killers' is how little it has to say. The constant cutting from one film stock to another, from black and white to colour, from video diary to spoof sitcom, obfuscates its simple satirical target: the tabloid media feeds off misery. It's a fair point, but this movie does nothing more than annoy while it's making it. The flashy techniques really don't add much to the one-dimensional story, the hammy acting, the once controversial but now quaint violence, and the over-the-top killers-as-folk-heroes aspect. Tarantino's name in the opening credits is a reminder that he probably would have made a far more interesting film.

    Natural Born Killers is one of the most craziest movies I have ever seen and one of the most interesting uses of cinematic techniques used in film. This film has a Quentin Taratino vibe to it and it almost feels as if he directed it. The film also has a message to it portraying the media as an organization who glorifies mass murder and makes it acceptable to all the young Americans. Cinematic-wise, I really enjoyed the lighting and stock footage and they made this film less conventional. Oliver Stone's film is about a husband and wife murder gang and the movie follows their tale from the beginning as the media begins to take hold of these cold-blooded murderers and show them to the public in a positive way. The acting is really good. Woody Harrelson put himself onto the map with his blood-lust role and he was superb. Juliette Lewis made a name for herself in the 1990's and this film is one of the reasons why. Downey Jr, as with most films, is the heart and soul and had some funny scenes. Tommy Lee Jones also does no wrong in his warden role. Overall, this is a fun, bloody film that may have a true message or two. It's different than most films and it reminds me of Taratino. However, if Taratino directed this, we may have even gotten a better film. The movie is not for those of faint heart because there is plenty of violence and blood. I'm quite shocked critics did not receive this film well. I rate this film 8/10.

    Natural Born Killers is a really bizarre film revolving around the lives of husband and wife serial killers Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis). What is interesting about this film is that whilst Tarantino was behind the original story, it is Oliver Stone who has directed this film and actually altered his story (which Tarantino wasn't happy about at the time). Stone seems to have directed NBK in the same style as Tarantino - you can tell this by the fact that the film keeps constantly jumping from colour to black and white, the random animation, the bizarre cut scenes. Whether this is a good or bad thing is a matter of opinion, but I personally found all the cut scenes both pointless and unnecessary and served as a distraction more than anything else. But the editing and direction weren't the only problems I had with NBK, The opening scene shows Mickey and Mallory in a cafe and Mallory gets up and starts dancing. 2 men enter the cafe and Mallory kills one of the men when he starts flirting with her and Mickey takes care of the other bloke. This was a pretty good opening scene (despite the rather strange 'cut scenes' in between). In the next scene we see how Micky and Mallory first met - they meet at Mallory's house, get talking go for a drive together and then plot to kill Mallory's parents - her dad (played by Rodney Dangerfield) was abusive to her and she also blames her mum (played by Edie McClurg) for standing by and not doing anything about it. OK - up to this point I was still buying it - there was at least a motive for this crime (abusive father and passive mother), but the film seems to base Mallory's whole motivation on killing lots of people on her troubled child hood. Really? Whilst I understand why Mallory might want to kill her father due to him being abusive to her and making her have a pretty traumatic child hood, I just couldn't see someone going out and killing lots of innocent people for that reason alone. Mickey's child hood is touched upon later in the film whilst he is being interviewed by TV Reporter Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr), but again the motivations for mass murder don't seem to be apparent. Another problem is the relationship between Micky and Mallory wasn't very well developed. We see they initially meet, go for a drive, kill Mallory's parents and then they get married - talk about rushed. Their child hood issues aren't really discussed and seemed to just be shown in occasional flashbacks (presumably just to be stylish). The acting was generally poor. Tommy Lee Jones was appalling as the prison warden and just seemed to be over acting in every scene he was in. Robert Downey Junior didn't fair much better (although his over acting wasn't quite as bad as TLJ's). Juliette Lewis was OK and Woody Harrelson faired slightly better (not brilliant though). I also thought that the opening scene would somehow tie in with the rest of the film as it was shot out of sequence (as with Pulp Fiction) but it didn't which was disappointing. As mentioned above, this film is full of style - lots of killings, black and white effects, nice animation etc. However, the film had no substance - bad script, dubious character motivations and direction and editing that were all over the place. Not recommended

    I haven't seen all of Oliver Stone's movies but I'm a fan of his and this has to be one of his best movies. Quentin Tarantino one of my favorite directors, wrote the screenplay and this was before Tarantino became a famous director in which he probably would'eve directed this himself. But supposedly the final film had little resemblance to Tarantino's original story and he wasn't happy with it but the story still feels very Tarantino to me. Since Bonnie & Clyde and the 1967 movie about them their have been a lot of people in real life and in fiction who try to imitate the whole lovers on a crime spree thing but no one done it "better" then Micky and Mallory Knox. But what makes this movie great is that it's about a lot more then just lovers on a crime spree, it's a witty, satirical look at our violent culture in 1990's America. The film has a lot going for it, a great story, great characters, great performances, a great visual style, great music, humor and social commentary. This movie should of been nominated for an Oscar, for this film effects you on a deeper level as Stone gives us a truthful look about how violent American culture has gotten through a warped and surreal point of view. I absolutely love Stone's direction here. I love the surreal look of the film, this film is a masterpiece of surrealism. Other directors tried what Stone did but never did it as good as him. I love the slanted camera angels, the switching from black and white to color, the channel surfing, the bizarre cut-aways, the random pieces of animation and the psychedelic backgrounds are all perfectly done. The surreal visuals never become overwhelming or distract from the story or characters. It's like an acid trip and perfectly creates the world of psychopathic lovers Micky & Mallory. I love the different type of music used here. The film's endlessly imaginative, visually creative and the surreality appropriately makes the film that much more intense or disturbing to watch. Some might disagree with Stone's viewpoints like how he blames the media for turning murders into celebrities but there is some truth there, just look at Casey Anthony or Jodie Aries. But the best thing about this movie is the story of Micky&Mallory. M&M are two of the greatest movie villains ever along side other fictitious killers like Hannible Lector or Norman Bates. Woody Harleson is perfect as the cool and calm but ruthless Micky and Juliet Lewis was born to play the more unstable and erratic Mallory. My favorite scene is the opening where everything seems all safe and peaceful with M&M at a small diner along side the highway, Malory does a sexy dance while listening to music but a drunk guy comes on to her and soon all hell break lose. Mallory begins to beat the guy to death and soon Micky joins in killing everyone else. They leave one person alive to "tell the tale" and the two then celebrate with a ballroom dance. Harlson & Lewis are all too believable in their roles as heartless killers. I love the flashback showing how they met and Mallory's horrific upbringing. It's a perfect satire that's shown as a 1950's TV show called "I love Mallory" with bright colors and a laugh track. Legendary comic Rodney Dangerfeild gives one of his best on screen performance as Malory's horrible father who physically, verbally and worst of all sexually abused her. And it's disturbing hearing the laugh track while Rodney molests his daughter. They don't exactly say how far the sexual abuse went as in did he have sex with her but Micky came to the rescue and together they killed her dad and her mom(for looking the other way). But unfortunately it didn't end there as the two got married and went on a road trip that ended in brutal mass murders wherever they go, ultimately killing 50 people in just 3 weeks. Unfortunley they never went in detail about Micky's upbringing but gave the impression that his father was abusive towards him and his mother and that his mom verbally abused him. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Wayne Gale a spoof on Geraldo Rivera. Downey is brilliantly over the top as a self centered news reporter glorifying M&M for his own gain. Tommy Lee Jones is also brilliantly over the top as a sleazy prison Warden. Tom Seizmore was great as the not too honest cop trying to capture M&M. All these characters are great but there's no one who's not morally bankrupt here, there's no real good guy. Micky's interview with Gale was a great scene where he expresses his unapologetic belief in murder, which led to the prison riots but it was creepy seeing black and white images of 1950's like families watching the horrific events on TV. At it's core this is a great romance, us against the world but the movie does make perfect satire on how people idolize them even though their mass murders. I like when Mallory does a sexy thing with her tongue during a deleted scene. The ending however seem unsettling as M&M get away, not killed but in the credits we see a glimpse of them having a family, happily ever after. I understand that some people felt that Stone treated M & M too much like anti-heroes then villains but I also understand that Stone wanted to go against our expectations and the evil killers live happily ever after. But a deleted scene gave a more satisfying ending where Owen, a prison inmate who helped them escape rides with them but unexpectedly kills them, which is perfect. M&M are not killed by the cops but by another psycho, a prisoner like them who most likely was in for murder. I wish he would'eve used that ending. But one of my favorite movies of all-time, a classic!

    This movie is genuine!!! First of all, the chemistry between Woody Harrelson (Mickie) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) is absolutely wonderful. Generally, the casting is exceptional because we see very talented actors such as Robert Downey Jr.(at this time he was a very promising actor) and Tomy lee Jones. The scenario is very well written and it's from Quentin Tarantino and the director is Oliver Stone. This is not a movie for everyone. You will either love it or hate it, because it contains too much violence and excessive language and the directing is a little bit weird.Totally not suitable for children and for those who are getting offended or frightened easily.For everyone else i highly recommend it. A definitely must see

    This Oliver Stone movie (written by Quentin Tarantino) is 100% experimental. Stone thinks if he goes "way over the top" in a story about two young lovers....who go on a killing spree, he will revolutionize cinema. It turns out to be a mega flop. When one thinks about the technology (and history) he had at his disposal, this really is poor movie making. This is cinemas Jackson Pollock. But, as art forms they are a million miles apart. Stone has made several good movies (without experimentation) and maybe he thought this was his "Pollock" moment. It really does not matter what drove Stone to make this utterly pretentious film. The important thing is...it is a complete bore.

    Natural Born Killers is a really bizarre film revolving around the lives of husband and wife serial killers Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis). What is interesting about this film is that whilst Tarantino was behind the original story, it is Oliver Stone who has directed this film and actually altered his story (which Tarantino wasn't happy about at the time). Stone seems to have directed NBK in the same style as Tarantino - you can tell this by the fact that the film keeps constantly jumping from colour to black and white, the random animation, the bizarre cut scenes. Whether this is a good or bad thing is a matter of opinion, but I personally found all the cut scenes both pointless and unnecessary and served as a distraction more than anything else. But the editing and direction weren't the only problems I had with NBK, The opening scene shows Mickey and Mallory in a cafe and Mallory gets up and starts dancing. 2 men enter the cafe and Mallory kills one of the men when he starts flirting with her and Mickey takes care of the other bloke. This was a pretty good opening scene (despite the rather strange 'cut scenes' in between). In the next scene we see how Micky and Mallory first met - they meet at Mallory's house, get talking go for a drive together and then plot to kill Mallory's parents - her dad (played by Rodney Dangerfield) was abusive to her and she also blames her mum (played by Edie McClurg) for standing by and not doing anything about it. OK - up to this point I was still buying it - there was at least a motive for this crime (abusive father and passive mother), but the film seems to base Mallory's whole motivation on killing lots of people on her troubled child hood. Really? Whilst I understand why Mallory might want to kill her father due to him being abusive to her and making her have a pretty traumatic child hood, I just couldn't see someone going out and killing lots of innocent people for that reason alone. Mickey's child hood is touched upon later in the film whilst he is being interviewed by TV Reporter Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr), but again the motivations for mass murder don't seem to be apparent. Another problem is the relationship between Micky and Mallory wasn't very well developed. We see they initially meet, go for a drive, kill Mallory's parents and then they get married - talk about rushed. Their child hood issues aren't really discussed and seemed to just be shown in occasional flashbacks (presumably just to be stylish). The acting was generally poor. Tommy Lee Jones was appalling as the prison warden and just seemed to be over acting in every scene he was in. Robert Downey Junior didn't fair much better (although his over acting wasn't quite as bad as TLJ's). Juliette Lewis was OK and Woody Harrelson faired slightly better (not brilliant though). I also thought that the opening scene would somehow tie in with the rest of the film as it was shot out of sequence (as with Pulp Fiction) but it didn't which was disappointing. As mentioned above, this film is full of style - lots of killings, black and white effects, nice animation etc. However, the film had no substance - bad script, dubious character motivations and direction and editing that were all over the place.

    I haven't seen all of Oliver Stone's movies but I'm a fan of his and this has to be one of his best movies. Quentin Tarantino one of my favorite directors, wrote the screenplay and this was before Tarantino became a famous director in which he probably would'eve directed this himself. But supposedly the final film had little resemblance to Tarantino's original story and he wasn't happy with it but the story still feels very Tarantino to me. Since Bonnie & Clyde and the 1967 movie about them their have been a lot of people in real life and in fiction who try to imitate the whole lovers on a crime spree thing but no one done it "better" then Micky and Mallory Knox. But what makes this movie great is that it's about a lot more then just lovers on a crime spree, it's a witty, satirical look at our violent culture in 1990's America. The film has a lot going for it, a great story, great characters, great performances, a great visual style, great music, humor and social commentary. This movie should of been nominated for an Oscar, for this film effects you on a deeper level as Stone gives us a truthful look about how violent American culture has gotten through a warped and surreal point of view. I absolutely love Stone's direction here. I love the surreal look of the film, this film is a masterpiece of surrealism. Other directors tried what Stone did but never did it as good as him. I love the slanted camera angels, the switching from black and white to color, the channel surfing, the bizarre cut-aways, the random pieces of animation and the psychedelic backgrounds are all perfectly done. The surreal visuals never become overwhelming or distract from the story or characters. It's like an acid trip and perfectly creates the world of psychopathic lovers Micky & Mallory. I love the different type of music used here. The film's endlessly imaginative, visually creative and the surreality appropriately makes the film that much more intense or disturbing to watch. Some might disagree with Stone's viewpoints like how he blames the media for turning murders into celebrities but there is some truth there, just look at Casey Anthony or Jodie Aries. But the best thing about this movie is the story of Micky&Mallory. M&M are two of the greatest movie villains ever along side other fictitious killers like Hannible Lector or Norman Bates. Woody Harleson is perfect as the cool and calm but ruthless Micky and Juliet Lewis was born to play the more unstable and erratic Mallory. My favorite scene is the opening where everything seems all safe and peaceful with M&M at a small diner along side the highway, Malory does a sexy dance while listening to music but a drunk guy comes on to her and soon all hell break lose. Mallory begins to beat the guy to death and soon Micky joins in killing everyone else. They leave one person alive to "tell the tale" and the two then celebrate with a ballroom dance. Harlson & Lewis are all too believable in their roles as heartless killers. I love the flashback showing how they met and Mallory's horrific upbringing. It's a perfect satire that's shown as a 1950's TV show called "I love Mallory" with bright colors and a laugh track. Legendary comic Rodney Dangerfeild gives one of his best on screen performance as Malory's horrible father who physically, verbally and worst of all sexually abused her. And it's disturbing hearing the laugh track while Rodney molests his daughter. They don't exactly say how far the sexual abuse went as in did he have sex with her but Micky came to the rescue and together they killed her dad and her mom(for looking the other way). But unfortunately it didn't end there as the two got married and went on a road trip that ended in brutal mass murders wherever they go, ultimately killing 50 people in just 3 weeks. Unfortunley they never went in detail about Micky's upbringing but gave the impression that his father was abusive towards him and his mother and that his mom verbally abused him. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Wayne Gale a spoof on Geraldo Rivera. Downey is brilliantly over the top as a self centered news reporter glorifying M&M for his own gain. Tommy Lee Jones is also brilliantly over the top as a sleazy prison Warden. Tom Seizmore was great as the not too honest cop trying to capture M&M. All these characters are great but there's no one who's not morally bankrupt here, there's no real good guy. Micky's interview with Gale was a great scene where he expresses his unapologetic belief in murder, which led to the prison riots but it was creepy seeing black and white images of 1950's like families watching the horrific events on TV. At it's core this is a great romance, us against the world but the movie does make perfect satire on how people idolize them even though their mass murders. I like when Mallory does a sexy thing with her tongue during a deleted scene. The ending however seem unsettling as M&M get away, not killed but in the credits we see a glimpse of them having a family, happily ever after. I understand that some people felt that Stone treated M & M too much like anti-heroes then villains but I also understand that Stone wanted to go against our expectations and the evil killers live happily ever after. But a deleted scene gave a more satisfying ending where Owen, a prison inmate who helped them escape rides with them but unexpectedly kills them, which is perfect. M&M are not killed by the cops but by another psycho, a prisoner like them who most likely was in for murder. I wish he would'eve used that ending. But one of my favorite movies of all-time, a classic!

    This movie is genuine!!! First of all, the chemistry between Woody Harrelson (Mickie) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) is absolutely wonderful. Generally, the casting is exceptional because we see very talented actors such as Robert Downey Jr.(at this time he was a very promising actor) and Tomy lee Jones. The scenario is very well written and it's from Quentin Tarantino and the director is Oliver Stone. This is not a movie for everyone. You will either love it or hate it, because it contains too much violence and excessive language and the directing is a little bit weird.Totally not suitable for children and for those who are getting offended or frightened easily.For everyone else i highly recommend it.

    This Oliver Stone movie (written by Quentin Tarantino) is 100% experimental. Stone thinks if he goes "way over the top" in a story about two young lovers....who go on a killing spree, he will revolutionize cinema. It turns out to be a mega flop. When one thinks about the technology (and history) he had at his disposal, this really is poor movie making. This is cinemas Jackson Pollock. But, as art forms they are a million miles apart. Stone has made several good movies (without experimentation) and maybe he thought this was his "Pollock" moment. It really does not matter what drove Stone to make this utterly pretentious film. The important thing is...it is a complete bore.

    I use to read some of the reviews before i write my own.That's because i want to have in mind several opinions.If you do this yourselves you will understand quickly that this movie is one of the most controversial. If you have checked my rating(which is quite possible) you will have already understood that i belong to the lovers of this movie and i don't believe that you will find many in the middle.I mean this movie is made to separate people into two contradicting sides.So i ain't gonna explain why i liked it so much....what i am gonna do is to fight the opposite side,always with good intentions... I don't believe that the point of the movie is to show two psychopaths serial killers and their daily routine, but, firstly, to make clear that mass media have chosen such subjects to attract viewers. The main point of the movie is blatant.In every second we can see that mass media,TV mostly,are the "third eye" through that,sometimes, a person see the world.For example if somebody make love with a woman or man what his/her third eye does is to make he/she see porn or beautiful sex scenes from his/her favorite TV series or rocky balboa making love his sexy wife and i don't know what else and that's media content.The main point is that one of the most important sources of association of ideas is mass media(TV mostly)and media needs characters that will attract and allure the viewers such as two natural born killers. In this movie these associations of ideas are shown through the Knox couple whose minds are already harmed from their childhood and the only thing that they get in return is "information".The information that TV gives which make them go nuts.They know that their new parents are mass media and they finally get to understand that media is not that better than their previous parents. I believe that oliver stone didn't want to underestimate common people and make two psychopaths look better but to show that these two psychopaths are partially a national product and this product has the support of justice ,science and government in order to stay active and profitable.

    At the top of my list of worst movie ever seen. If someone asked me what's the worst movie you have ever seen without doubt this twisted, sick, worthless piece of crap movie comes to my mind first. I don't know what the director of this movie was thinking of himself when he made this utterly disgraceful movie. IMDb's rating encouraged me to watch this crap (cant actually call it a movie), after watching it I wonder how it got that much rating. I cannot believe people actually like this worthless video of nothing but violence all the way. The story writer and director must be as crazy as the protagonist. The advice for those who own the DVD of this crap is to shred them to as many pieces as possible and for those planning to watch it should think about the most awful movie they have ever seen and believe me this loathsome video is gonna replace that spot. Conclusion--- This is awful,loathsome,repulsive,disgusting---(you can add all the other words in dictionary which mean worthless and unimaginably terrible). That's why it doesn't even deserve a single second of your life. !!!! WARNING!!! SO DON'T BE FOOLED By ITS RATING, please.

    This is not the movie for an average American , who sit watching sitcoms all day . This is a movie about the mind of a killer , this is a very serious and poignant view into the brain of a mad people who live in this world , most Americans can not comprehend how the mind of the killer works , but Hitler and Stalin were just like that , they loved their ideas , and by killing innocent people they were elevated into belief that they were above average person , Mickey tells it exactly how it feels , he thinks he is above everyone , because he can kill . I can understand why so many Americans hate this movie , because it shows how media glorify violence , and show it all the time to gain viewing from everybody . Wake up people , this not a lie , this is not even close to real life madness and murder , This is happening all over the world , don't you remember WTC ? videos of cutting the heads of the body by al kaida ? tortures in Guantanamo? Drug wars in Mexico? This movie is nothing compared to violence going on everyday on this planet.

    Fear and Loathing seems bland in comparison. If I could only watch ten DVDs for the rest of time, this would be one of them. Oliver Stone did something with NBK that I hadn't seen since (and still haven't since). Not only is it well made but the actors act (strange, I know). It truly is a visionary achievement (well, let's face it with a story from Tarantino it was never going to be simple), it's use of colour, opposing styles and iconography, throughout, make it impossible to ignore. Okay, granted it IS ridiculous but it's that special kind of ridiculous, the "f*ck it, we're here now, might as well" kind, and it gets me every time. I won't spoil it or give you the story: just prepare yourselves for a masterclass in true cinema. It wouldn't suit any other style, I can't imagine it being shown in any other way. Mickey and Mallory remain one of the greatest screen pairings of all time (the same to be said for Lewis and Harrelson), badder than Beatrix and Bill, cooler than Trinity and Neo. It's fast, it's vicious but it NEVER lets your eyes wander away. A gripping story throughout. But if you like your bones white and your coffee black and your tie in the centre of your suit; this isn't for you.

    The most surprising thing about 'Natural Born Killers' is how little it has to say. The constant cutting from one film stock to another, from black and white to colour, from video diary to spoof sitcom, obfuscates its simple satirical target: the tabloid media feeds off misery. It's a fair point, but this movie does nothing more than annoy while it's making it. The flashy techniques really don't add much to the one-dimensional story, the hammy acting, the once controversial but now quaint violence, and the over-the-top killers-as-folk-heroes aspect. Tarantino's name in the opening credits is a reminder that he probably would have made a far more interesting film.

    Natural Born Killers is one of the most craziest movies I have ever seen and one of the most interesting uses of cinematic techniques used in film. This film has a Quentin Taratino vibe to it and it almost feels as if he directed it. The film also has a message to it portraying the media as an organization who glorifies mass murder and makes it acceptable to all the young Americans. Cinematic-wise, I really enjoyed the lighting and stock footage and they made this film less conventional. Oliver Stone's film is about a husband and wife murder gang and the movie follows their tale from the beginning as the media begins to take hold of these cold-blooded murderers and show them to the public in a positive way. The acting is really good. Woody Harrelson put himself onto the map with his blood-lust role and he was superb. Juliette Lewis made a name for herself in the 1990's and this film is one of the reasons why. Downey Jr, as with most films, is the heart and soul and had some funny scenes. Tommy Lee Jones also does no wrong in his warden role. Overall, this is a fun, bloody film that may have a true message or two. It's different than most films and it reminds me of Taratino. However, if Taratino directed this, we may have even gotten a better film. The movie is not for those of faint heart because there is plenty of violence and blood. I'm quite shocked critics did not receive this film well. I rate this film 8/10.

The main point of the movie is blatant.In every second we can see that mass media,TV mostly,are the "third eye" through that,sometimes, a person see the world.For example if somebody make love with a woman or man what his/her third eye does is to make he/she see porn or beautiful sex scenes from his/her favorite TV series or rocky balboa making love his sexy wife and i don't know what else and that's media content.The main point is that one of the most important sources of association of ideas is mass media(TV mostly)and media needs characters that will attract and allure the viewers such as two natural born killers. In this movie these associations of ideas are shown through the Knox couple whose minds are already harmed from their childhood and the only thing that they get in return is "information".The information that TV gives which make them go nuts.They know that their new parents are mass media and they finally get to understand that media is not that better than their previous parents. I believe that oliver stone didn't want to underestimate common people and make two psychopaths look better but to show that these two psychopaths are partially a national product and this product has the support of justice ,science and government in order to stay active and profitable.

    At the top of my list of worst movie ever seen. If someone asked me what's the worst movie you have ever seen without doubt this twisted, sick, worthless piece of crap movie comes to my mind first. I don't know what the director of this movie was thinking of himself when he made this utterly disgraceful movie. IMDb's rating encouraged me to watch this crap (cant actually call it a movie), after watching it I wonder how it got that much rating. I cannot believe people actually like this worthless video of nothing but violence all the way. The story writer and director must be as crazy as the protagonist. The advice for those who own the DVD of this crap is to shred them to as many pieces as possible and for those planning to watch it should think about the most awful movie they have ever seen and believe me this loathsome video is gonna replace that spot. Conclusion--- This is awful,loathsome,repulsive,disgusting---(you can add all the other words in dictionary which mean worthless and unimaginably terrible). That's why it doesn't even deserve a single second of your life. !!!! WARNING!!! SO DON'T BE FOOLED By ITS RATING, please.

    This is not the movie for an average American , who sit watching sitcoms all day . This is a movie about the mind of a killer , this is a very serious and poignant view into the brain of a mad people who live in this world , most Americans can not comprehend how the mind of the killer works , but Hitler and Stalin were just like that , they loved their ideas , and by killing innocent people they were elevated into belief that they were above average person , Mickey tells it exactly how it feels , he thinks he is above everyone , because he can kill . I can understand why so many Americans hate this movie , because it shows how media glorify violence , and show it all the time to gain viewing from everybody . Wake up people , this not a lie , this is not even close to real life madness and murder , This is happening all over the world , don't you remember WTC ? videos of cutting the heads of the body by al kaida ? tortures in Guantanamo? Drug wars in Mexico? This movie is nothing compared to violence going on everyday on this planet.

    Fear and Loathing seems bland in comparison. If I could only watch ten DVDs for the rest of time, this would be one of them. Oliver Stone did something with NBK that I hadn't seen since (and still haven't since). Not only is it well made but the actors act (strange, I know). It truly is a visionary achievement (well, let's face it with a story from Tarantino it was never going to be simple), it's use of colour, opposing styles and iconography, throughout, make it impossible to ignore. Okay, granted it IS ridiculous but it's that special kind of ridiculous, the "f*ck it, we're here now, might as well" kind, and it gets me every time. I won't spoil it or give you the story: just prepare yourselves for a masterclass in true cinema. It wouldn't suit any other style, I can't imagine it being shown in any other way. Mickey and Mallory remain one of the greatest screen pairings of all time (the same to be said for Lewis and Harrelson), badder than Beatrix and Bill, cooler than Trinity and Neo. It's fast, it's vicious but it NEVER lets your eyes wander away. A gripping story throughout. But if you like your bones white and your coffee black and your tie in the centre of your suit; this isn't for you.

    The most surprising thing about 'Natural Born Killers' is how little it has to say. The constant cutting from one film stock to another, from black and white to colour, from video diary to spoof sitcom, obfuscates its simple satirical target: the tabloid media feeds off misery. It's a fair point, but this movie does nothing more than annoy while it's making it. The flashy techniques really don't add much to the one-dimensional story, the hammy acting, the once controversial but now quaint violence, and the over-the-top killers-as-folk-heroes aspect. Tarantino's name in the opening credits is a reminder that he probably would have made a far more interesting film.

    Natural Born Killers is one of the most craziest movies I have ever seen and one of the most interesting uses of cinematic techniques used in film. This film has a Quentin Taratino vibe to it and it almost feels as if he directed it. The film also has a message to it portraying the media as an organization who glorifies mass murder and makes it acceptable to all the young Americans. Cinematic-wise, I really enjoyed the lighting and stock footage and they made this film less conventional. Oliver Stone's film is about a husband and wife murder gang and the movie follows their tale from the beginning as the media begins to take hold of these cold-blooded murderers and show them to the public in a positive way. The acting is really good. Woody Harrelson put himself onto the map with his blood-lust role and he was superb. Juliette Lewis made a name for herself in the 1990's and this film is one of the reasons why. Downey Jr, as with most films, is the heart and soul and had some funny scenes. Tommy Lee Jones also does no wrong in his warden role. Overall, this is a fun, bloody film that may have a true message or two. It's different than most films and it reminds me of Taratino. However, if Taratino directed this, we may have even gotten a better film. The movie is not for those of faint heart because there is plenty of violence and blood. I'm quite shocked critics did not receive this film well. I rate this film 8/10.

    Natural Born Killers is a really bizarre film revolving around the lives of husband and wife serial killers Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis). What is interesting about this film is that whilst Tarantino was behind the original story, it is Oliver Stone who has directed this film and actually altered his story (which Tarantino wasn't happy about at the time). Stone seems to have directed NBK in the same style as Tarantino - you can tell this by the fact that the film keeps constantly jumping from colour to black and white, the random animation, the bizarre cut scenes. Whether this is a good or bad thing is a matter of opinion, but I personally found all the cut scenes both pointless and unnecessary and served as a distraction more than anything else. But the editing and direction weren't the only problems I had with NBK, The opening scene shows Mickey and Mallory in a cafe and Mallory gets up and starts dancing. 2 men enter the cafe and Mallory kills one of the men when he starts flirting with her and Mickey takes care of the other bloke. This was a pretty good opening scene (despite the rather strange 'cut scenes' in between). In the next scene we see how Micky and Mallory first met - they meet at Mallory's house, get talking go for a drive together and then plot to kill Mallory's parents - her dad (played by Rodney Dangerfield) was abusive to her and she also blames her mum (played by Edie McClurg) for standing by and not doing anything about it. OK - up to this point I was still buying it - there was at least a motive for this crime (abusive father and passive mother), but the film seems to base Mallory's whole motivation on killing lots of people on her troubled child hood. Really? Whilst I understand why Mallory might want to kill her father due to him being abusive to her and making her have a pretty traumatic child hood, I just couldn't see someone going out and killing lots of innocent people for that reason alone. Mickey's child hood is touched upon later in the film whilst he is being interviewed by TV Reporter Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr), but again the motivations for mass murder don't seem to be apparent. Another problem is the relationship between Micky and Mallory wasn't very well developed. We see they initially meet, go for a drive, kill Mallory's parents and then they get married - talk about rushed. Their child hood issues aren't really discussed and seemed to just be shown in occasional flashbacks (presumably just to be stylish). The acting was generally poor. Tommy Lee Jones was appalling as the prison warden and just seemed to be over acting in every scene he was in. Robert Downey Junior didn't fair much better (although his over acting wasn't quite as bad as TLJ's). Juliette Lewis was OK and Woody Harrelson faired slightly better (not brilliant though). I also thought that the opening scene would somehow tie in with the rest of the film as it was shot out of sequence (as with Pulp Fiction) but it didn't which was disappointing. As mentioned above, this film is full of style - lots of killings, black and white effects, nice animation etc. However, the film had no substance - bad script, dubious character motivations and direction and editing that were all over the place. Not recommended

    I haven't seen all of Oliver Stone's movies but I'm a fan of his and this has to be one of his best movies. Quentin Tarantino one of my favorite directors, wrote the screenplay and this was before Tarantino became a famous director in which he probably would'eve directed this himself. But supposedly the final film had little resemblance to Tarantino's original story and he wasn't happy with it but the story still feels very Tarantino to me. Since Bonnie & Clyde and the 1967 movie about them their have been a lot of people in real life and in fiction who try to imitate the whole lovers on a crime spree thing but no one done it "better" then Micky and Mallory Knox. But what makes this movie great is that it's about a lot more then just lovers on a crime spree, it's a witty, satirical look at our violent culture in 1990's America. The film has a lot going for it, a great story, great characters, great performances, a great visual style, great music, humor and social commentary. This movie should of been nominated for an Oscar, for this film effects you on a deeper level as Stone gives us a truthful look about how violent American culture has gotten through a warped and surreal point of view. I absolutely love Stone's direction here. I love the surreal look of the film, this film is a masterpiece of surrealism. Other directors tried what Stone did but never did it as good as him. I love the slanted camera angels, the switching from black and white to color, the channel surfing, the bizarre cut-aways, the random pieces of animation and the psychedelic backgrounds are all perfectly done. The surreal visuals never become overwhelming or distract from the story or characters. It's like an acid trip and perfectly creates the world of psychopathic lovers Micky & Mallory. I love the different type of music used here. The film's endlessly imaginative, visually creative and the surreality appropriately makes the film that much more intense or disturbing to watch. Some might disagree with Stone's viewpoints like how he blames the media for turning murders into celebrities but there is some truth there, just look at Casey Anthony or Jodie Aries. But the best thing about this movie is the story of Micky&Mallory. M&M are two of the greatest movie villains ever along side other fictitious killers like Hannible Lector or Norman Bates. Woody Harleson is perfect as the cool and calm but ruthless Micky and Juliet Lewis was born to play the more unstable and erratic Mallory. My favorite scene is the opening where everything seems all safe and peaceful with M&M at a small diner along side the highway, Malory does a sexy dance while listening to music but a drunk guy comes on to her and soon all hell break lose. Mallory begins to beat the guy to death and soon Micky joins in killing everyone else. They leave one person alive to "tell the tale" and the two then celebrate with a ballroom dance. Harlson & Lewis are all too believable in their roles as heartless killers. I love the flashback showing how they met and Mallory's horrific upbringing. It's a perfect satire that's shown as a 1950's TV show called "I love Mallory" with bright colors and a laugh track. Legendary comic Rodney Dangerfeild gives one of his best on screen performance as Malory's horrible father who physically, verbally and worst of all sexually abused her. And it's disturbing hearing the laugh track while Rodney molests his daughter. They don't exactly say how far the sexual abuse went as in did he have sex with her but Micky came to the rescue and together they killed her dad and her mom(for looking the other way). But unfortunately it didn't end there as the two got married and went on a road trip that ended in brutal mass murders wherever they go, ultimately killing 50 people in just 3 weeks. Unfortunley they never went in detail about Micky's upbringing but gave the impression that his father was abusive towards him and his mother and that his mom verbally abused him. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Wayne Gale a spoof on Geraldo Rivera. Downey is brilliantly over the top as a self centered news reporter glorifying M&M for his own gain. Tommy Lee Jones is also brilliantly over the top as a sleazy prison Warden. Tom Seizmore was great as the not too honest cop trying to capture M&M. All these characters are great but there's no one who's not morally bankrupt here, there's no real good guy. Micky's interview with Gale was a great scene where he expresses his unapologetic belief in murder, which led to the prison riots but it was creepy seeing black and white images of 1950's like families watching the horrific events on TV. At it's core this is a great romance, us against the world but the movie does make perfect satire on how people idolize them even though their mass murders. I like when Mallory does a sexy thing with her tongue during a deleted scene. The ending however seem unsettling as M&M get away, not killed but in the credits we see a glimpse of them having a family, happily ever after. I understand that some people felt that Stone treated M & M too much like anti-heroes then villains but I also understand that Stone wanted to go against our expectations and the evil killers live happily ever after. But a deleted scene gave a more satisfying ending where Owen, a prison inmate who helped them escape rides with them but unexpectedly kills them, which is perfect. M&M are not killed by the cops but by another psycho, a prisoner like them who most likely was in for murder. I wish he would'eve used that ending. But one of my favorite movies of all-time, a classic!

    This movie is genuine!!! First of all, the chemistry between Woody Harrelson (Mickie) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) is absolutely wonderful. Generally, the casting is exceptional because we see very talented actors such as Robert Downey Jr.(at this time he was a very promising actor) and Tomy lee Jones. The scenario is very well written and it's from Quentin Tarantino and the director is Oliver Stone. This is not a movie for everyone. You will either love it or hate it, because it contains too much violence and excessive language and the directing is a little bit weird.Totally not suitable for children and for those who are getting offended or frightened easily.For everyone else i highly recommend it. A definitely must see

    This Oliver Stone movie (written by Quentin Tarantino) is 100% experimental. Stone thinks if he goes "way over the top" in a story about two young lovers....who go on a killing spree, he will revolutionize cinema. It turns out to be a mega flop. When one thinks about the technology (and history) he had at his disposal, this really is poor movie making. This is cinemas Jackson Pollock. But, as art forms they are a million miles apart. Stone has made several good movies (without experimentation) and maybe he thought this was his "Pollock" moment. It really does not matter what drove Stone to make this utterly pretentious film. The important thing is...it is a complete bore.

I also thought that the opening scene would somehow tie in with the rest of the film as it was shot out of sequence (as with Pulp Fiction) but it didn't which was disappointing. As mentioned above, this film is full of style - lots of killings, black and white effects, nice animation etc. However, the film had no substance - bad script, dubious character motivations and direction and editing that were all over the place.

    I haven't seen all of Oliver Stone's movies but I'm a fan of his and this has to be one of his best movies. Quentin Tarantino one of my favorite directors, wrote the screenplay and this was before Tarantino became a famous director in which he probably would'eve directed this himself. But supposedly the final film had little resemblance to Tarantino's original story and he wasn't happy with it but the story still feels very Tarantino to me. Since Bonnie & Clyde and the 1967 movie about them their have been a lot of people in real life and in fiction who try to imitate the whole lovers on a crime spree thing but no one done it "better" then Micky and Mallory Knox. But what makes this movie great is that it's about a lot more then just lovers on a crime spree, it's a witty, satirical look at our violent culture in 1990's America. The film has a lot going for it, a great story, great characters, great performances, a great visual style, great music, humor and social commentary. This movie should of been nominated for an Oscar, for this film effects you on a deeper level as Stone gives us a truthful look about how violent American culture has gotten through a warped and surreal point of view. I absolutely love Stone's direction here. I love the surreal look of the film, this film is a masterpiece of surrealism. Other directors tried what Stone did but never did it as good as him. I love the slanted camera angels, the switching from black and white to color, the channel surfing, the bizarre cut-aways, the random pieces of animation and the psychedelic backgrounds are all perfectly done. The surreal visuals never become overwhelming or distract from the story or characters. It's like an acid trip and perfectly creates the world of psychopathic lovers Micky & Mallory. I love the different type of music used here. The film's endlessly imaginative, visually creative and the surreality appropriately makes the film that much more intense or disturbing to watch. Some might disagree with Stone's viewpoints like how he blames the media for turning murders into celebrities but there is some truth there, just look at Casey Anthony or Jodie Aries. But the best thing about this movie is the story of Micky&Mallory. M&M are two of the greatest movie villains ever along side other fictitious killers like Hannible Lector or Norman Bates. Woody Harleson is perfect as the cool and calm but ruthless Micky and Juliet Lewis was born to play the more unstable and erratic Mallory. My favorite scene is the opening where everything seems all safe and peaceful with M&M at a small diner along side the highway, Malory does a sexy dance while listening to music but a drunk guy comes on to her and soon all hell break lose. Mallory begins to beat the guy to death and soon Micky joins in killing everyone else. They leave one person alive to "tell the tale" and the two then celebrate with a ballroom dance. Harlson & Lewis are all too believable in their roles as heartless killers. I love the flashback showing how they met and Mallory's horrific upbringing. It's a perfect satire that's shown as a 1950's TV show called "I love Mallory" with bright colors and a laugh track. Legendary comic Rodney Dangerfeild gives one of his best on screen performance as Malory's horrible father who physically, verbally and worst of all sexually abused her. And it's disturbing hearing the laugh track while Rodney molests his daughter. They don't exactly say how far the sexual abuse went as in did he have sex with her but Micky came to the rescue and together they killed her dad and her mom(for looking the other way). But unfortunately it didn't end there as the two got married and went on a road trip that ended in brutal mass murders wherever they go, ultimately killing 50 people in just 3 weeks. Unfortunley they never went in detail about Micky's upbringing but gave the impression that his father was abusive towards him and his mother and that his mom verbally abused him. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Wayne Gale a spoof on Geraldo Rivera. Downey is brilliantly over the top as a self centered news reporter glorifying M&M for his own gain. Tommy Lee Jones is also brilliantly over the top as a sleazy prison Warden. Tom Seizmore was great as the not too honest cop trying to capture M&M. All these characters are great but there's no one who's not morally bankrupt here, there's no real good guy. Micky's interview with Gale was a great scene where he expresses his unapologetic belief in murder, which led to the prison riots but it was creepy seeing black and white images of 1950's like families watching the horrific events on TV. At it's core this is a great romance, us against the world but the movie does make perfect satire on how people idolize them even though their mass murders. I like when Mallory does a sexy thing with her tongue during a deleted scene. The ending however seem unsettling as M&M get away, not killed but in the credits we see a glimpse of them having a family, happily ever after. I understand that some people felt that Stone treated M & M too much like anti-heroes then villains but I also understand that Stone wanted to go against our expectations and the evil killers live happily ever after. But a deleted scene gave a more satisfying ending where Owen, a prison inmate who helped them escape rides with them but unexpectedly kills them, which is perfect. M&M are not killed by the cops but by another psycho, a prisoner like them who most likely was in for murder. I wish he would'eve used that ending. But one of my favorite movies of all-time, a classic!

    This movie is genuine!!! First of all, the chemistry between Woody Harrelson (Mickie) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) is absolutely wonderful. Generally, the casting is exceptional because we see very talented actors such as Robert Downey Jr.(at this time he was a very promising actor) and Tomy lee Jones. The scenario is very well written and it's from Quentin Tarantino and the director is Oliver Stone. This is not a movie for everyone. You will either love it or hate it, because it contains too much violence and excessive language and the directing is a little bit weird.Totally not suitable for children and for those who are getting offended or frightened easily.For everyone else i highly recommend it.

    This Oliver Stone movie (written by Quentin Tarantino) is 100% experimental. Stone thinks if he goes "way over the top" in a story about two young lovers....who go on a killing spree, he will revolutionize cinema. It turns out to be a mega flop. When one thinks about the technology (and history) he had at his disposal, this really is poor movie making. This is cinemas Jackson Pollock. But, as art forms they are a million miles apart. Stone has made several good movies (without experimentation) and maybe he thought this was his "Pollock" moment. It really does not matter what drove Stone to make this utterly pretentious film. The important thing is...it is a complete bore.

    I use to read some of the reviews before i write my own.That's because i want to have in mind several opinions.If you do this yourselves you will understand quickly that this movie is one of the most controversial. If you have checked my rating(which is quite possible) you will have already understood that i belong to the lovers of this movie and i don't believe that you will find many in the middle.I mean this movie is made to separate people into two contradicting sides.So i ain't gonna explain why i liked it so much....what i am gonna do is to fight the opposite side,always with good intentions... I don't believe that the point of the movie is to show two psychopaths serial killers and their daily routine, but, firstly, to make clear that mass media have chosen such subjects to attract viewers. The main point of the movie is blatant.In every second we can see that mass media,TV mostly,are the "third eye" through that,sometimes, a person see the world.For example if somebody make love with a woman or man what his/her third eye does is to make he/she see porn or beautiful sex scenes from his/her favorite TV series or rocky balboa making love his sexy wife and i don't know what else and that's media content.The main point is that one of the most important sources of association of ideas is mass media(TV mostly)and media needs characters that will attract and allure the viewers such as two natural born killers. In this movie these associations of ideas are shown through the Knox couple whose minds are already harmed from their childhood and the only thing that they get in return is "information".The information that TV gives which make them go nuts.They know that their new parents are mass media and they finally get to understand that media is not that better than their previous parents. I believe that oliver stone didn't want to underestimate common people and make two psychopaths look better but to show that these two psychopaths are partially a national product and this product has the support of justice ,science and government in order to stay active and profitable.

    At the top of my list of worst movie ever seen. If someone asked me what's the worst movie you have ever seen without doubt this twisted, sick, worthless piece of crap movie comes to my mind first. I don't know what the director of this movie was thinking of himself when he made this utterly disgraceful movie. IMDb's rating encouraged me to watch this crap (cant actually call it a movie), after watching it I wonder how it got that much rating. I cannot believe people actually like this worthless video of nothing but violence all the way. The story writer and director must be as crazy as the protagonist. The advice for those who own the DVD of this crap is to shred them to as many pieces as possible and for those planning to watch it should think about the most awful movie they have ever seen and believe me this loathsome video is gonna replace that spot. Conclusion--- This is awful,loathsome,repulsive,disgusting---(you can add all the other words in dictionary which mean worthless and unimaginably terrible). That's why it doesn't even deserve a single second of your life. !!!! WARNING!!! SO DON'T BE FOOLED By ITS RATING, please.

    This is not the movie for an average American , who sit watching sitcoms all day . This is a movie about the mind of a killer , this is a very serious and poignant view into the brain of a mad people who live in this world , most Americans can not comprehend how the mind of the killer works , but Hitler and Stalin were just like that , they loved their ideas , and by killing innocent people they were elevated into belief that they were above average person , Mickey tells it exactly how it feels , he thinks he is above everyone , because he can kill . I can understand why so many Americans hate this movie , because it shows how media glorify violence , and show it all the time to gain viewing from everybody . Wake up people , this not a lie , this is not even close to real life madness and murder , This is happening all over the world , don't you remember WTC ? videos of cutting the heads of the body by al kaida ? tortures in Guantanamo? Drug wars in Mexico? This movie is nothing compared to violence going on everyday on this planet.

    Fear and Loathing seems bland in comparison. If I could only watch ten DVDs for the rest of time, this would be one of them. Oliver Stone did something with NBK that I hadn't seen since (and still haven't since). Not only is it well made but the actors act (strange, I know). It truly is a visionary achievement (well, let's face it with a story from Tarantino it was never going to be simple), it's use of colour, opposing styles and iconography, throughout, make it impossible to ignore. Okay, granted it IS ridiculous but it's that special kind of ridiculous, the "f*ck it, we're here now, might as well" kind, and it gets me every time. I won't spoil it or give you the story: just prepare yourselves for a masterclass in true cinema. It wouldn't suit any other style, I can't imagine it being shown in any other way. Mickey and Mallory remain one of the greatest screen pairings of all time (the same to be said for Lewis and Harrelson), badder than Beatrix and Bill, cooler than Trinity and Neo. It's fast, it's vicious but it NEVER lets your eyes wander away. A gripping story throughout. But if you like your bones white and your coffee black and your tie in the centre of your suit; this isn't for you.

    The most surprising thing about 'Natural Born Killers' is how little it has to say. The constant cutting from one film stock to another, from black and white to colour, from video diary to spoof sitcom, obfuscates its simple satirical target: the tabloid media feeds off misery. It's a fair point, but this movie does nothing more than annoy while it's making it. The flashy techniques really don't add much to the one-dimensional story, the hammy acting, the once controversial but now quaint violence, and the over-the-top killers-as-folk-heroes aspect. Tarantino's name in the opening credits is a reminder that he probably would have made a far more interesting film.

    Natural Born Killers is one of the most craziest movies I have ever seen and one of the most interesting uses of cinematic techniques used in film. This film has a Quentin Taratino vibe to it and it almost feels as if he directed it. The film also has a message to it portraying the media as an organization who glorifies mass murder and makes it acceptable to all the young Americans. Cinematic-wise, I really enjoyed the lighting and stock footage and they made this film less conventional. Oliver Stone's film is about a husband and wife murder gang and the movie follows their tale from the beginning as the media begins to take hold of these cold-blooded murderers and show them to the public in a positive way. The acting is really good. Woody Harrelson put himself onto the map with his blood-lust role and he was superb. Juliette Lewis made a name for herself in the 1990's and this film is one of the reasons why. Downey Jr, as with most films, is the heart and soul and had some funny scenes. Tommy Lee Jones also does no wrong in his warden role. Overall, this is a fun, bloody film that may have a true message or two. It's different than most films and it reminds me of Taratino. However, if Taratino directed this, we may have even gotten a better film. The movie is not for those of faint heart because there is plenty of violence and blood. I'm quite shocked critics did not receive this film well. I rate this film 8/10.

    Natural Born Killers is a really bizarre film revolving around the lives of husband and wife serial killers Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis). What is interesting about this film is that whilst Tarantino was behind the original story, it is Oliver Stone who has directed this film and actually altered his story (which Tarantino wasn't happy about at the time). Stone seems to have directed NBK in the same style as Tarantino - you can tell this by the fact that the film keeps constantly jumping from colour to black and white, the random animation, the bizarre cut scenes. Whether this is a good or bad thing is a matter of opinion, but I personally found all the cut scenes both pointless and unnecessary and served as a distraction more than anything else. But the editing and direction weren't the only problems I had with NBK, The opening scene shows Mickey and Mallory in a cafe and Mallory gets up and starts dancing. 2 men enter the cafe and Mallory kills one of the men when he starts flirting with her and Mickey takes care of the other bloke. This was a pretty good opening scene (despite the rather strange 'cut scenes' in between). In the next scene we see how Micky and Mallory first met - they meet at Mallory's house, get talking go for a drive together and then plot to kill Mallory's parents - her dad (played by Rodney Dangerfield) was abusive to her and she also blames her mum (played by Edie McClurg) for standing by and not doing anything about it. OK - up to this point I was still buying it - there was at least a motive for this crime (abusive father and passive mother), but the film seems to base Mallory's whole motivation on killing lots of people on her troubled child hood. Really? Whilst I understand why Mallory might want to kill her father due to him being abusive to her and making her have a pretty traumatic child hood, I just couldn't see someone going out and killing lots of innocent people for that reason alone. Mickey's child hood is touched upon later in the film whilst he is being interviewed by TV Reporter Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr), but again the motivations for mass murder don't seem to be apparent. Another problem is the relationship between Micky and Mallory wasn't very well developed. We see they initially meet, go for a drive, kill Mallory's parents and then they get married - talk about rushed. Their child hood issues aren't really discussed and seemed to just be shown in occasional flashbacks (presumably just to be stylish). The acting was generally poor. Tommy Lee Jones was appalling as the prison warden and just seemed to be over acting in every scene he was in. Robert Downey Junior didn't fair much better (although his over acting wasn't quite as bad as TLJ's). Juliette Lewis was OK and Woody Harrelson faired slightly better (not brilliant though). I also thought that the opening scene would somehow tie in with the rest of the film as it was shot out of sequence (as with Pulp Fiction) but it didn't which was disappointing.

Conclusion--- This is awful,loathsome,repulsive,disgusting---(you can add all the other words in dictionary which mean worthless and unimaginably terrible). That's why it doesn't even deserve a single second of your life. !!!! WARNING!!! SO DON'T BE FOOLED By ITS RATING, please.

    This is not the movie for an average American , who sit watching sitcoms all day . This is a movie about the mind of a killer , this is a very serious and poignant view into the brain of a mad people who live in this world , most Americans can not comprehend how the mind of the killer works , but Hitler and Stalin were just like that , they loved their ideas , and by killing innocent people they were elevated into belief that they were above average person , Mickey tells it exactly how it feels , he thinks he is above everyone , because he can kill . I can understand why so many Americans hate this movie , because it shows how media glorify violence , and show it all the time to gain viewing from everybody . Wake up people , this not a lie , this is not even close to real life madness and murder , This is happening all over the world , don't you remember WTC ? videos of cutting the heads of the body by al kaida ? tortures in Guantanamo? Drug wars in Mexico? This movie is nothing compared to violence going on everyday on this planet.

    Fear and Loathing seems bland in comparison. If I could only watch ten DVDs for the rest of time, this would be one of them. Oliver Stone did something with NBK that I hadn't seen since (and still haven't since). Not only is it well made but the actors act (strange, I know). It truly is a visionary achievement (well, let's face it with a story from Tarantino it was never going to be simple), it's use of colour, opposing styles and iconography, throughout, make it impossible to ignore. Okay, granted it IS ridiculous but it's that special kind of ridiculous, the "f*ck it, we're here now, might as well" kind, and it gets me every time. I won't spoil it or give you the story: just prepare yourselves for a masterclass in true cinema. It wouldn't suit any other style, I can't imagine it being shown in any other way. Mickey and Mallory remain one of the greatest screen pairings of all time (the same to be said for Lewis and Harrelson), badder than Beatrix and Bill, cooler than Trinity and Neo. It's fast, it's vicious but it NEVER lets your eyes wander away. A gripping story throughout. But if you like your bones white and your coffee black and your tie in the centre of your suit; this isn't for you.

    The most surprising thing about 'Natural Born Killers' is how little it has to say. The constant cutting from one film stock to another, from black and white to colour, from video diary to spoof sitcom, obfuscates its simple satirical target: the tabloid media feeds off misery. It's a fair point, but this movie does nothing more than annoy while it's making it. The flashy techniques really don't add much to the one-dimensional story, the hammy acting, the once controversial but now quaint violence, and the over-the-top killers-as-folk-heroes aspect. Tarantino's name in the opening credits is a reminder that he probably would have made a far more interesting film.

    Natural Born Killers is one of the most craziest movies I have ever seen and one of the most interesting uses of cinematic techniques used in film. This film has a Quentin Taratino vibe to it and it almost feels as if he directed it. The film also has a message to it portraying the media as an organization who glorifies mass murder and makes it acceptable to all the young Americans. Cinematic-wise, I really enjoyed the lighting and stock footage and they made this film less conventional. Oliver Stone's film is about a husband and wife murder gang and the movie follows their tale from the beginning as the media begins to take hold of these cold-blooded murderers and show them to the public in a positive way. The acting is really good. Woody Harrelson put himself onto the map with his blood-lust role and he was superb. Juliette Lewis made a name for herself in the 1990's and this film is one of the reasons why. Downey Jr, as with most films, is the heart and soul and had some funny scenes. Tommy Lee Jones also does no wrong in his warden role. Overall, this is a fun, bloody film that may have a true message or two. It's different than most films and it reminds me of Taratino. However, if Taratino directed this, we may have even gotten a better film. The movie is not for those of faint heart because there is plenty of violence and blood. I'm quite shocked critics did not receive this film well. I rate this film 8/10.

    Natural Born Killers is a really bizarre film revolving around the lives of husband and wife serial killers Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis). What is interesting about this film is that whilst Tarantino was behind the original story, it is Oliver Stone who has directed this film and actually altered his story (which Tarantino wasn't happy about at the time). Stone seems to have directed NBK in the same style as Tarantino - you can tell this by the fact that the film keeps constantly jumping from colour to black and white, the random animation, the bizarre cut scenes. Whether this is a good or bad thing is a matter of opinion, but I personally found all the cut scenes both pointless and unnecessary and served as a distraction more than anything else. But the editing and direction weren't the only problems I had with NBK, The opening scene shows Mickey and Mallory in a cafe and Mallory gets up and starts dancing. 2 men enter the cafe and Mallory kills one of the men when he starts flirting with her and Mickey takes care of the other bloke. This was a pretty good opening scene (despite the rather strange 'cut scenes' in between). In the next scene we see how Micky and Mallory first met - they meet at Mallory's house, get talking go for a drive together and then plot to kill Mallory's parents - her dad (played by Rodney Dangerfield) was abusive to her and she also blames her mum (played by Edie McClurg) for standing by and not doing anything about it. OK - up to this point I was still buying it - there was at least a motive for this crime (abusive father and passive mother), but the film seems to base Mallory's whole motivation on killing lots of people on her troubled child hood. Really? Whilst I understand why Mallory might want to kill her father due to him being abusive to her and making her have a pretty traumatic child hood, I just couldn't see someone going out and killing lots of innocent people for that reason alone. Mickey's child hood is touched upon later in the film whilst he is being interviewed by TV Reporter Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr), but again the motivations for mass murder don't seem to be apparent. Another problem is the relationship between Micky and Mallory wasn't very well developed. We see they initially meet, go for a drive, kill Mallory's parents and then they get married - talk about rushed. Their child hood issues aren't really discussed and seemed to just be shown in occasional flashbacks (presumably just to be stylish). The acting was generally poor. Tommy Lee Jones was appalling as the prison warden and just seemed to be over acting in every scene he was in. Robert Downey Junior didn't fair much better (although his over acting wasn't quite as bad as TLJ's). Juliette Lewis was OK and Woody Harrelson faired slightly better (not brilliant though). I also thought that the opening scene would somehow tie in with the rest of the film as it was shot out of sequence (as with Pulp Fiction) but it didn't which was disappointing. As mentioned above, this film is full of style - lots of killings, black and white effects, nice animation etc. However, the film had no substance - bad script, dubious character motivations and direction and editing that were all over the place. Not recommended

    I haven't seen all of Oliver Stone's movies but I'm a fan of his and this has to be one of his best movies. Quentin Tarantino one of my favorite directors, wrote the screenplay and this was before Tarantino became a famous director in which he probably would'eve directed this himself. But supposedly the final film had little resemblance to Tarantino's original story and he wasn't happy with it but the story still feels very Tarantino to me. Since Bonnie & Clyde and the 1967 movie about them their have been a lot of people in real life and in fiction who try to imitate the whole lovers on a crime spree thing but no one done it "better" then Micky and Mallory Knox. But what makes this movie great is that it's about a lot more then just lovers on a crime spree, it's a witty, satirical look at our violent culture in 1990's America. The film has a lot going for it, a great story, great characters, great performances, a great visual style, great music, humor and social commentary. This movie should of been nominated for an Oscar, for this film effects you on a deeper level as Stone gives us a truthful look about how violent American culture has gotten through a warped and surreal point of view. I absolutely love Stone's direction here. I love the surreal look of the film, this film is a masterpiece of surrealism. Other directors tried what Stone did but never did it as good as him. I love the slanted camera angels, the switching from black and white to color, the channel surfing, the bizarre cut-aways, the random pieces of animation and the psychedelic backgrounds are all perfectly done. The surreal visuals never become overwhelming or distract from the story or characters. It's like an acid trip and perfectly creates the world of psychopathic lovers Micky & Mallory. I love the different type of music used here. The film's endlessly imaginative, visually creative and the surreality appropriately makes the film that much more intense or disturbing to watch. Some might disagree with Stone's viewpoints like how he blames the media for turning murders into celebrities but there is some truth there, just look at Casey Anthony or Jodie Aries. But the best thing about this movie is the story of Micky&Mallory. M&M are two of the greatest movie villains ever along side other fictitious killers like Hannible Lector or Norman Bates. Woody Harleson is perfect as the cool and calm but ruthless Micky and Juliet Lewis was born to play the more unstable and erratic Mallory. My favorite scene is the opening where everything seems all safe and peaceful with M&M at a small diner along side the highway, Malory does a sexy dance while listening to music but a drunk guy comes on to her and soon all hell break lose. Mallory begins to beat the guy to death and soon Micky joins in killing everyone else. They leave one person alive to "tell the tale" and the two then celebrate with a ballroom dance. Harlson & Lewis are all too believable in their roles as heartless killers. I love the flashback showing how they met and Mallory's horrific upbringing. It's a perfect satire that's shown as a 1950's TV show called "I love Mallory" with bright colors and a laugh track. Legendary comic Rodney Dangerfeild gives one of his best on screen performance as Malory's horrible father who physically, verbally and worst of all sexually abused her. And it's disturbing hearing the laugh track while Rodney molests his daughter. They don't exactly say how far the sexual abuse went as in did he have sex with her but Micky came to the rescue and together they killed her dad and her mom(for looking the other way). But unfortunately it didn't end there as the two got married and went on a road trip that ended in brutal mass murders wherever they go, ultimately killing 50 people in just 3 weeks. Unfortunley they never went in detail about Micky's upbringing but gave the impression that his father was abusive towards him and his mother and that his mom verbally abused him. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Wayne Gale a spoof on Geraldo Rivera. Downey is brilliantly over the top as a self centered news reporter glorifying M&M for his own gain. Tommy Lee Jones is also brilliantly over the top as a sleazy prison Warden. Tom Seizmore was great as the not too honest cop trying to capture M&M. All these characters are great but there's no one who's not morally bankrupt here, there's no real good guy. Micky's interview with Gale was a great scene where he expresses his unapologetic belief in murder, which led to the prison riots but it was creepy seeing black and white images of 1950's like families watching the horrific events on TV. At it's core this is a great romance, us against the world but the movie does make perfect satire on how people idolize them even though their mass murders. I like when Mallory does a sexy thing with her tongue during a deleted scene. The ending however seem unsettling as M&M get away, not killed but in the credits we see a glimpse of them having a family, happily ever after. I understand that some people felt that Stone treated M & M too much like anti-heroes then villains but I also understand that Stone wanted to go against our expectations and the evil killers live happily ever after. But a deleted scene gave a more satisfying ending where Owen, a prison inmate who helped them escape rides with them but unexpectedly kills them, which is perfect. M&M are not killed by the cops but by another psycho, a prisoner like them who most likely was in for murder. I wish he would'eve used that ending. But one of my favorite movies of all-time, a classic!

    This movie is genuine!!! First of all, the chemistry between Woody Harrelson (Mickie) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) is absolutely wonderful. Generally, the casting is exceptional because we see very talented actors such as Robert Downey Jr.(at this time he was a very promising actor) and Tomy lee Jones. The scenario is very well written and it's from Quentin Tarantino and the director is Oliver Stone. This is not a movie for everyone. You will either love it or hate it, because it contains too much violence and excessive language and the directing is a little bit weird.Totally not suitable for children and for those who are getting offended or frightened easily.For everyone else i highly recommend it. A definitely must see

    This Oliver Stone movie (written by Quentin Tarantino) is 100% experimental. Stone thinks if he goes "way over the top" in a story about two young lovers....who go on a killing spree, he will revolutionize cinema. It turns out to be a mega flop. When one thinks about the technology (and history) he had at his disposal, this really is poor movie making. This is cinemas Jackson Pollock. But, as art forms they are a million miles apart. Stone has made several good movies (without experimentation) and maybe he thought this was his "Pollock" moment. It really does not matter what drove Stone to make this utterly pretentious film. The important thing is...it is a complete bore.

    I use to read some of the reviews before i write my own.That's because i want to have in mind several opinions.If you do this yourselves you will understand quickly that this movie is one of the most controversial. If you have checked my rating(which is quite possible) you will have already understood that i belong to the lovers of this movie and i don't believe that you will find many in the middle.I mean this movie is made to separate people into two contradicting sides.So i ain't gonna explain why i liked it so much....what i am gonna do is to fight the opposite side,always with good intentions... I don't believe that the point of the movie is to show two psychopaths serial killers and their daily routine, but, firstly, to make clear that mass media have chosen such subjects to attract viewers. The main point of the movie is blatant.In every second we can see that mass media,TV mostly,are the "third eye" through that,sometimes, a person see the world.For example if somebody make love with a woman or man what his/her third eye does is to make he/she see porn or beautiful sex scenes from his/her favorite TV series or rocky balboa making love his sexy wife and i don't know what else and that's media content.The main point is that one of the most important sources of association of ideas is mass media(TV mostly)and media needs characters that will attract and allure the viewers such as two natural born killers. In this movie these associations of ideas are shown through the Knox couple whose minds are already harmed from their childhood and the only thing that they get in return is "information".The information that TV gives which make them go nuts.They know that their new parents are mass media and they finally get to understand that media is not that better than their previous parents. I believe that oliver stone didn't want to underestimate common people and make two psychopaths look better but to show that these two psychopaths are partially a national product and this product has the support of justice ,science and government in order to stay active and profitable.

    At the top of my list of worst movie ever seen. If someone asked me what's the worst movie you have ever seen without doubt this twisted, sick, worthless piece of crap movie comes to my mind first. I don't know what the director of this movie was thinking of himself when he made this utterly disgraceful movie. IMDb's rating encouraged me to watch this crap (cant actually call it a movie), after watching it I wonder how it got that much rating. I cannot believe people actually like this worthless video of nothing but violence all the way. The story writer and director must be as crazy as the protagonist. The advice for those who own the DVD of this crap is to shred them to as many pieces as possible and for those planning to watch it should think about the most awful movie they have ever seen and believe me this loathsome video is gonna replace that spot.

I love the different type of music used here. The film's endlessly imaginative, visually creative and the surreality appropriately makes the film that much more intense or disturbing to watch. Some might disagree with Stone's viewpoints like how he blames the media for turning murders into celebrities but there is some truth there, just look at Casey Anthony or Jodie Aries. But the best thing about this movie is the story of Micky&Mallory. M&M are two of the greatest movie villains ever along side other fictitious killers like Hannible Lector or Norman Bates. Woody Harleson is perfect as the cool and calm but ruthless Micky and Juliet Lewis was born to play the more unstable and erratic Mallory. My favorite scene is the opening where everything seems all safe and peaceful with M&M at a small diner along side the highway, Malory does a sexy dance while listening to music but a drunk guy comes on to her and soon all hell break lose. Mallory begins to beat the guy to death and soon Micky joins in killing everyone else. They leave one person alive to "tell the tale" and the two then celebrate with a ballroom dance. Harlson & Lewis are all too believable in their roles as heartless killers. I love the flashback showing how they met and Mallory's horrific upbringing. It's a perfect satire that's shown as a 1950's TV show called "I love Mallory" with bright colors and a laugh track. Legendary comic Rodney Dangerfeild gives one of his best on screen performance as Malory's horrible father who physically, verbally and worst of all sexually abused her. And it's disturbing hearing the laugh track while Rodney molests his daughter. They don't exactly say how far the sexual abuse went as in did he have sex with her but Micky came to the rescue and together they killed her dad and her mom(for looking the other way). But unfortunately it didn't end there as the two got married and went on a road trip that ended in brutal mass murders wherever they go, ultimately killing 50 people in just 3 weeks. Unfortunley they never went in detail about Micky's upbringing but gave the impression that his father was abusive towards him and his mother and that his mom verbally abused him. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Wayne Gale a spoof on Geraldo Rivera. Downey is brilliantly over the top as a self centered news reporter glorifying M&M for his own gain. Tommy Lee Jones is also brilliantly over the top as a sleazy prison Warden. Tom Seizmore was great as the not too honest cop trying to capture M&M. All these characters are great but there's no one who's not morally bankrupt here, there's no real good guy. Micky's interview with Gale was a great scene where he expresses his unapologetic belief in murder, which led to the prison riots but it was creepy seeing black and white images of 1950's like families watching the horrific events on TV. At it's core this is a great romance, us against the world but the movie does make perfect satire on how people idolize them even though their mass murders. I like when Mallory does a sexy thing with her tongue during a deleted scene. The ending however seem unsettling as M&M get away, not killed but in the credits we see a glimpse of them having a family, happily ever after. I understand that some people felt that Stone treated M & M too much like anti-heroes then villains but I also understand that Stone wanted to go against our expectations and the evil killers live happily ever after. But a deleted scene gave a more satisfying ending where Owen, a prison inmate who helped them escape rides with them but unexpectedly kills them, which is perfect. M&M are not killed by the cops but by another psycho, a prisoner like them who most likely was in for murder. I wish he would'eve used that ending. But one of my favorite movies of all-time, a classic!

    This movie is genuine!!! First of all, the chemistry between Woody Harrelson (Mickie) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) is absolutely wonderful. Generally, the casting is exceptional because we see very talented actors such as Robert Downey Jr.(at this time he was a very promising actor) and Tomy lee Jones. The scenario is very well written and it's from Quentin Tarantino and the director is Oliver Stone. This is not a movie for everyone. You will either love it or hate it, because it contains too much violence and excessive language and the directing is a little bit weird.Totally not suitable for children and for those who are getting offended or frightened easily.For everyone else i highly recommend it.

    This Oliver Stone movie (written by Quentin Tarantino) is 100% experimental. Stone thinks if he goes "way over the top" in a story about two young lovers....who go on a killing spree, he will revolutionize cinema. It turns out to be a mega flop. When one thinks about the technology (and history) he had at his disposal, this really is poor movie making. This is cinemas Jackson Pollock. But, as art forms they are a million miles apart. Stone has made several good movies (without experimentation) and maybe he thought this was his "Pollock" moment. It really does not matter what drove Stone to make this utterly pretentious film. The important thing is...it is a complete bore.

    I use to read some of the reviews before i write my own.That's because i want to have in mind several opinions.If you do this yourselves you will understand quickly that this movie is one of the most controversial. If you have checked my rating(which is quite possible) you will have already understood that i belong to the lovers of this movie and i don't believe that you will find many in the middle.I mean this movie is made to separate people into two contradicting sides.So i ain't gonna explain why i liked it so much....what i am gonna do is to fight the opposite side,always with good intentions... I don't believe that the point of the movie is to show two psychopaths serial killers and their daily routine, but, firstly, to make clear that mass media have chosen such subjects to attract viewers. The main point of the movie is blatant.In every second we can see that mass media,TV mostly,are the "third eye" through that,sometimes, a person see the world.For example if somebody make love with a woman or man what his/her third eye does is to make he/she see porn or beautiful sex scenes from his/her favorite TV series or rocky balboa making love his sexy wife and i don't know what else and that's media content.The main point is that one of the most important sources of association of ideas is mass media(TV mostly)and media needs characters that will attract and allure the viewers such as two natural born killers. In this movie these associations of ideas are shown through the Knox couple whose minds are already harmed from their childhood and the only thing that they get in return is "information".The information that TV gives which make them go nuts.They know that their new parents are mass media and they finally get to understand that media is not that better than their previous parents. I believe that oliver stone didn't want to underestimate common people and make two psychopaths look better but to show that these two psychopaths are partially a national product and this product has the support of justice ,science and government in order to stay active and profitable.

    At the top of my list of worst movie ever seen. If someone asked me what's the worst movie you have ever seen without doubt this twisted, sick, worthless piece of crap movie comes to my mind first. I don't know what the director of this movie was thinking of himself when he made this utterly disgraceful movie. IMDb's rating encouraged me to watch this crap (cant actually call it a movie), after watching it I wonder how it got that much rating. I cannot believe people actually like this worthless video of nothing but violence all the way. The story writer and director must be as crazy as the protagonist. The advice for those who own the DVD of this crap is to shred them to as many pieces as possible and for those planning to watch it should think about the most awful movie they have ever seen and believe me this loathsome video is gonna replace that spot. Conclusion--- This is awful,loathsome,repulsive,disgusting---(you can add all the other words in dictionary which mean worthless and unimaginably terrible). That's why it doesn't even deserve a single second of your life. !!!! WARNING!!! SO DON'T BE FOOLED By ITS RATING, please.

    This is not the movie for an average American , who sit watching sitcoms all day . This is a movie about the mind of a killer , this is a very serious and poignant view into the brain of a mad people who live in this world , most Americans can not comprehend how the mind of the killer works , but Hitler and Stalin were just like that , they loved their ideas , and by killing innocent people they were elevated into belief that they were above average person , Mickey tells it exactly how it feels , he thinks he is above everyone , because he can kill . I can understand why so many Americans hate this movie , because it shows how media glorify violence , and show it all the time to gain viewing from everybody . Wake up people , this not a lie , this is not even close to real life madness and murder , This is happening all over the world , don't you remember WTC ? videos of cutting the heads of the body by al kaida ? tortures in Guantanamo? Drug wars in Mexico? This movie is nothing compared to violence going on everyday on this planet.

    Fear and Loathing seems bland in comparison. If I could only watch ten DVDs for the rest of time, this would be one of them. Oliver Stone did something with NBK that I hadn't seen since (and still haven't since). Not only is it well made but the actors act (strange, I know). It truly is a visionary achievement (well, let's face it with a story from Tarantino it was never going to be simple), it's use of colour, opposing styles and iconography, throughout, make it impossible to ignore. Okay, granted it IS ridiculous but it's that special kind of ridiculous, the "f*ck it, we're here now, might as well" kind, and it gets me every time. I won't spoil it or give you the story: just prepare yourselves for a masterclass in true cinema. It wouldn't suit any other style, I can't imagine it being shown in any other way. Mickey and Mallory remain one of the greatest screen pairings of all time (the same to be said for Lewis and Harrelson), badder than Beatrix and Bill, cooler than Trinity and Neo. It's fast, it's vicious but it NEVER lets your eyes wander away. A gripping story throughout. But if you like your bones white and your coffee black and your tie in the centre of your suit; this isn't for you.

    The most surprising thing about 'Natural Born Killers' is how little it has to say. The constant cutting from one film stock to another, from black and white to colour, from video diary to spoof sitcom, obfuscates its simple satirical target: the tabloid media feeds off misery. It's a fair point, but this movie does nothing more than annoy while it's making it. The flashy techniques really don't add much to the one-dimensional story, the hammy acting, the once controversial but now quaint violence, and the over-the-top killers-as-folk-heroes aspect. Tarantino's name in the opening credits is a reminder that he probably would have made a far more interesting film.

    Natural Born Killers is one of the most craziest movies I have ever seen and one of the most interesting uses of cinematic techniques used in film. This film has a Quentin Taratino vibe to it and it almost feels as if he directed it. The film also has a message to it portraying the media as an organization who glorifies mass murder and makes it acceptable to all the young Americans. Cinematic-wise, I really enjoyed the lighting and stock footage and they made this film less conventional. Oliver Stone's film is about a husband and wife murder gang and the movie follows their tale from the beginning as the media begins to take hold of these cold-blooded murderers and show them to the public in a positive way. The acting is really good. Woody Harrelson put himself onto the map with his blood-lust role and he was superb. Juliette Lewis made a name for herself in the 1990's and this film is one of the reasons why. Downey Jr, as with most films, is the heart and soul and had some funny scenes. Tommy Lee Jones also does no wrong in his warden role. Overall, this is a fun, bloody film that may have a true message or two. It's different than most films and it reminds me of Taratino. However, if Taratino directed this, we may have even gotten a better film. The movie is not for those of faint heart because there is plenty of violence and blood. I'm quite shocked critics did not receive this film well. I rate this film 8/10.

    Natural Born Killers is a really bizarre film revolving around the lives of husband and wife serial killers Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis). What is interesting about this film is that whilst Tarantino was behind the original story, it is Oliver Stone who has directed this film and actually altered his story (which Tarantino wasn't happy about at the time). Stone seems to have directed NBK in the same style as Tarantino - you can tell this by the fact that the film keeps constantly jumping from colour to black and white, the random animation, the bizarre cut scenes. Whether this is a good or bad thing is a matter of opinion, but I personally found all the cut scenes both pointless and unnecessary and served as a distraction more than anything else. But the editing and direction weren't the only problems I had with NBK, The opening scene shows Mickey and Mallory in a cafe and Mallory gets up and starts dancing. 2 men enter the cafe and Mallory kills one of the men when he starts flirting with her and Mickey takes care of the other bloke. This was a pretty good opening scene (despite the rather strange 'cut scenes' in between). In the next scene we see how Micky and Mallory first met - they meet at Mallory's house, get talking go for a drive together and then plot to kill Mallory's parents - her dad (played by Rodney Dangerfield) was abusive to her and she also blames her mum (played by Edie McClurg) for standing by and not doing anything about it. OK - up to this point I was still buying it - there was at least a motive for this crime (abusive father and passive mother), but the film seems to base Mallory's whole motivation on killing lots of people on her troubled child hood. Really? Whilst I understand why Mallory might want to kill her father due to him being abusive to her and making her have a pretty traumatic child hood, I just couldn't see someone going out and killing lots of innocent people for that reason alone. Mickey's child hood is touched upon later in the film whilst he is being interviewed by TV Reporter Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr), but again the motivations for mass murder don't seem to be apparent. Another problem is the relationship between Micky and Mallory wasn't very well developed. We see they initially meet, go for a drive, kill Mallory's parents and then they get married - talk about rushed. Their child hood issues aren't really discussed and seemed to just be shown in occasional flashbacks (presumably just to be stylish). The acting was generally poor. Tommy Lee Jones was appalling as the prison warden and just seemed to be over acting in every scene he was in. Robert Downey Junior didn't fair much better (although his over acting wasn't quite as bad as TLJ's). Juliette Lewis was OK and Woody Harrelson faired slightly better (not brilliant though). I also thought that the opening scene would somehow tie in with the rest of the film as it was shot out of sequence (as with Pulp Fiction) but it didn't which was disappointing. As mentioned above, this film is full of style - lots of killings, black and white effects, nice animation etc. However, the film had no substance - bad script, dubious character motivations and direction and editing that were all over the place. Not recommended

    I haven't seen all of Oliver Stone's movies but I'm a fan of his and this has to be one of his best movies. Quentin Tarantino one of my favorite directors, wrote the screenplay and this was before Tarantino became a famous director in which he probably would'eve directed this himself. But supposedly the final film had little resemblance to Tarantino's original story and he wasn't happy with it but the story still feels very Tarantino to me. Since Bonnie & Clyde and the 1967 movie about them their have been a lot of people in real life and in fiction who try to imitate the whole lovers on a crime spree thing but no one done it "better" then Micky and Mallory Knox. But what makes this movie great is that it's about a lot more then just lovers on a crime spree, it's a witty, satirical look at our violent culture in 1990's America. The film has a lot going for it, a great story, great characters, great performances, a great visual style, great music, humor and social commentary. This movie should of been nominated for an Oscar, for this film effects you on a deeper level as Stone gives us a truthful look about how violent American culture has gotten through a warped and surreal point of view. I absolutely love Stone's direction here. I love the surreal look of the film, this film is a masterpiece of surrealism. Other directors tried what Stone did but never did it as good as him. I love the slanted camera angels, the switching from black and white to color, the channel surfing, the bizarre cut-aways, the random pieces of animation and the psychedelic backgrounds are all perfectly done. The surreal visuals never become overwhelming or distract from the story or characters. It's like an acid trip and perfectly creates the world of psychopathic lovers Micky & Mallory. I love the different type of music used here. The film's endlessly imaginative, visually creative and the surreality appropriately makes the film that much more intense or disturbing to watch. Some might disagree with Stone's viewpoints like how he blames the media for turning murders into celebrities but there is some truth there, just look at Casey Anthony or Jodie Aries.

Okay, granted it IS ridiculous but it's that special kind of ridiculous, the "f*ck it, we're here now, might as well" kind, and it gets me every time. I won't spoil it or give you the story: just prepare yourselves for a masterclass in true cinema. It wouldn't suit any other style, I can't imagine it being shown in any other way. Mickey and Mallory remain one of the greatest screen pairings of all time (the same to be said for Lewis and Harrelson), badder than Beatrix and Bill, cooler than Trinity and Neo. It's fast, it's vicious but it NEVER lets your eyes wander away. A gripping story throughout. But if you like your bones white and your coffee black and your tie in the centre of your suit; this isn't for you.

    The most surprising thing about 'Natural Born Killers' is how little it has to say. The constant cutting from one film stock to another, from black and white to colour, from video diary to spoof sitcom, obfuscates its simple satirical target: the tabloid media feeds off misery. It's a fair point, but this movie does nothing more than annoy while it's making it. The flashy techniques really don't add much to the one-dimensional story, the hammy acting, the once controversial but now quaint violence, and the over-the-top killers-as-folk-heroes aspect. Tarantino's name in the opening credits is a reminder that he probably would have made a far more interesting film.

    Natural Born Killers is one of the most craziest movies I have ever seen and one of the most interesting uses of cinematic techniques used in film. This film has a Quentin Taratino vibe to it and it almost feels as if he directed it. The film also has a message to it portraying the media as an organization who glorifies mass murder and makes it acceptable to all the young Americans. Cinematic-wise, I really enjoyed the lighting and stock footage and they made this film less conventional. Oliver Stone's film is about a husband and wife murder gang and the movie follows their tale from the beginning as the media begins to take hold of these cold-blooded murderers and show them to the public in a positive way. The acting is really good. Woody Harrelson put himself onto the map with his blood-lust role and he was superb. Juliette Lewis made a name for herself in the 1990's and this film is one of the reasons why. Downey Jr, as with most films, is the heart and soul and had some funny scenes. Tommy Lee Jones also does no wrong in his warden role. Overall, this is a fun, bloody film that may have a true message or two. It's different than most films and it reminds me of Taratino. However, if Taratino directed this, we may have even gotten a better film. The movie is not for those of faint heart because there is plenty of violence and blood. I'm quite shocked critics did not receive this film well. I rate this film 8/10.

    Natural Born Killers is a really bizarre film revolving around the lives of husband and wife serial killers Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis). What is interesting about this film is that whilst Tarantino was behind the original story, it is Oliver Stone who has directed this film and actually altered his story (which Tarantino wasn't happy about at the time). Stone seems to have directed NBK in the same style as Tarantino - you can tell this by the fact that the film keeps constantly jumping from colour to black and white, the random animation, the bizarre cut scenes. Whether this is a good or bad thing is a matter of opinion, but I personally found all the cut scenes both pointless and unnecessary and served as a distraction more than anything else. But the editing and direction weren't the only problems I had with NBK, The opening scene shows Mickey and Mallory in a cafe and Mallory gets up and starts dancing. 2 men enter the cafe and Mallory kills one of the men when he starts flirting with her and Mickey takes care of the other bloke. This was a pretty good opening scene (despite the rather strange 'cut scenes' in between). In the next scene we see how Micky and Mallory first met - they meet at Mallory's house, get talking go for a drive together and then plot to kill Mallory's parents - her dad (played by Rodney Dangerfield) was abusive to her and she also blames her mum (played by Edie McClurg) for standing by and not doing anything about it. OK - up to this point I was still buying it - there was at least a motive for this crime (abusive father and passive mother), but the film seems to base Mallory's whole motivation on killing lots of people on her troubled child hood. Really? Whilst I understand why Mallory might want to kill her father due to him being abusive to her and making her have a pretty traumatic child hood, I just couldn't see someone going out and killing lots of innocent people for that reason alone. Mickey's child hood is touched upon later in the film whilst he is being interviewed by TV Reporter Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr), but again the motivations for mass murder don't seem to be apparent. Another problem is the relationship between Micky and Mallory wasn't very well developed. We see they initially meet, go for a drive, kill Mallory's parents and then they get married - talk about rushed. Their child hood issues aren't really discussed and seemed to just be shown in occasional flashbacks (presumably just to be stylish). The acting was generally poor. Tommy Lee Jones was appalling as the prison warden and just seemed to be over acting in every scene he was in. Robert Downey Junior didn't fair much better (although his over acting wasn't quite as bad as TLJ's). Juliette Lewis was OK and Woody Harrelson faired slightly better (not brilliant though). I also thought that the opening scene would somehow tie in with the rest of the film as it was shot out of sequence (as with Pulp Fiction) but it didn't which was disappointing. As mentioned above, this film is full of style - lots of killings, black and white effects, nice animation etc. However, the film had no substance - bad script, dubious character motivations and direction and editing that were all over the place. Not recommended

    I haven't seen all of Oliver Stone's movies but I'm a fan of his and this has to be one of his best movies. Quentin Tarantino one of my favorite directors, wrote the screenplay and this was before Tarantino became a famous director in which he probably would'eve directed this himself. But supposedly the final film had little resemblance to Tarantino's original story and he wasn't happy with it but the story still feels very Tarantino to me. Since Bonnie & Clyde and the 1967 movie about them their have been a lot of people in real life and in fiction who try to imitate the whole lovers on a crime spree thing but no one done it "better" then Micky and Mallory Knox. But what makes this movie great is that it's about a lot more then just lovers on a crime spree, it's a witty, satirical look at our violent culture in 1990's America. The film has a lot going for it, a great story, great characters, great performances, a great visual style, great music, humor and social commentary. This movie should of been nominated for an Oscar, for this film effects you on a deeper level as Stone gives us a truthful look about how violent American culture has gotten through a warped and surreal point of view. I absolutely love Stone's direction here. I love the surreal look of the film, this film is a masterpiece of surrealism. Other directors tried what Stone did but never did it as good as him. I love the slanted camera angels, the switching from black and white to color, the channel surfing, the bizarre cut-aways, the random pieces of animation and the psychedelic backgrounds are all perfectly done. The surreal visuals never become overwhelming or distract from the story or characters. It's like an acid trip and perfectly creates the world of psychopathic lovers Micky & Mallory. I love the different type of music used here. The film's endlessly imaginative, visually creative and the surreality appropriately makes the film that much more intense or disturbing to watch. Some might disagree with Stone's viewpoints like how he blames the media for turning murders into celebrities but there is some truth there, just look at Casey Anthony or Jodie Aries. But the best thing about this movie is the story of Micky&Mallory. M&M are two of the greatest movie villains ever along side other fictitious killers like Hannible Lector or Norman Bates. Woody Harleson is perfect as the cool and calm but ruthless Micky and Juliet Lewis was born to play the more unstable and erratic Mallory. My favorite scene is the opening where everything seems all safe and peaceful with M&M at a small diner along side the highway, Malory does a sexy dance while listening to music but a drunk guy comes on to her and soon all hell break lose. Mallory begins to beat the guy to death and soon Micky joins in killing everyone else. They leave one person alive to "tell the tale" and the two then celebrate with a ballroom dance. Harlson & Lewis are all too believable in their roles as heartless killers. I love the flashback showing how they met and Mallory's horrific upbringing. It's a perfect satire that's shown as a 1950's TV show called "I love Mallory" with bright colors and a laugh track. Legendary comic Rodney Dangerfeild gives one of his best on screen performance as Malory's horrible father who physically, verbally and worst of all sexually abused her. And it's disturbing hearing the laugh track while Rodney molests his daughter. They don't exactly say how far the sexual abuse went as in did he have sex with her but Micky came to the rescue and together they killed her dad and her mom(for looking the other way). But unfortunately it didn't end there as the two got married and went on a road trip that ended in brutal mass murders wherever they go, ultimately killing 50 people in just 3 weeks. Unfortunley they never went in detail about Micky's upbringing but gave the impression that his father was abusive towards him and his mother and that his mom verbally abused him. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Wayne Gale a spoof on Geraldo Rivera. Downey is brilliantly over the top as a self centered news reporter glorifying M&M for his own gain. Tommy Lee Jones is also brilliantly over the top as a sleazy prison Warden. Tom Seizmore was great as the not too honest cop trying to capture M&M. All these characters are great but there's no one who's not morally bankrupt here, there's no real good guy. Micky's interview with Gale was a great scene where he expresses his unapologetic belief in murder, which led to the prison riots but it was creepy seeing black and white images of 1950's like families watching the horrific events on TV. At it's core this is a great romance, us against the world but the movie does make perfect satire on how people idolize them even though their mass murders. I like when Mallory does a sexy thing with her tongue during a deleted scene. The ending however seem unsettling as M&M get away, not killed but in the credits we see a glimpse of them having a family, happily ever after. I understand that some people felt that Stone treated M & M too much like anti-heroes then villains but I also understand that Stone wanted to go against our expectations and the evil killers live happily ever after. But a deleted scene gave a more satisfying ending where Owen, a prison inmate who helped them escape rides with them but unexpectedly kills them, which is perfect. M&M are not killed by the cops but by another psycho, a prisoner like them who most likely was in for murder. I wish he would'eve used that ending. But one of my favorite movies of all-time, a classic!

    This movie is genuine!!! First of all, the chemistry between Woody Harrelson (Mickie) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) is absolutely wonderful. Generally, the casting is exceptional because we see very talented actors such as Robert Downey Jr.(at this time he was a very promising actor) and Tomy lee Jones. The scenario is very well written and it's from Quentin Tarantino and the director is Oliver Stone. This is not a movie for everyone. You will either love it or hate it, because it contains too much violence and excessive language and the directing is a little bit weird.Totally not suitable for children and for those who are getting offended or frightened easily.For everyone else i highly recommend it. A definitely must see

    This Oliver Stone movie (written by Quentin Tarantino) is 100% experimental. Stone thinks if he goes "way over the top" in a story about two young lovers....who go on a killing spree, he will revolutionize cinema. It turns out to be a mega flop. When one thinks about the technology (and history) he had at his disposal, this really is poor movie making. This is cinemas Jackson Pollock. But, as art forms they are a million miles apart. Stone has made several good movies (without experimentation) and maybe he thought this was his "Pollock" moment. It really does not matter what drove Stone to make this utterly pretentious film. The important thing is...it is a complete bore.
