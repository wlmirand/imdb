 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Dowd, who's IRA, escapes an Irish prison in a bloody jailbreak, making his way to New York City where he lives alone, avoids Irish hangouts, and works as a dishwasher. When a good deed gets him stabbed, one of the restaurant employees takes him in and finds him medical care. As Dowd recovers in the flat of Tulio and Tulio's sister Monica, he realizes that these Guatemalan exiles share his rebellious principles. When he learns they are planning a political assassination, he offers to help. His attraction to Monica contributes to his willingness to volunteer. However, the cops are closing in on him: can he make the hit, protect his new friends, and escape with Monica?

    For fans of Stephen Rea, I recommend seeing this good prison escape movie...I wish this film would be on DVD...its far underrated for an action/drama movie...its an Irish film but really deserved far more coverage here in USA...

    Stephen Rea is at it again, with the IRA I mean, and the beginning prison break scene is non-stop action, which continues for the whole film. The violent breakout with his pal Richard (Brendan Gleesan) leads him to break all ties and land in NYC circa 1996. He gets a job washing dishes and works with Tulio (Alfred Molina), gets involved with his sister Monica (Rosana Pastor), and ends up helping them take out a Guatemalan death squad commander who's funded by the CIA. Well I have to say this was a refreshing alternative film, a bit of underground New York, a bit of Leftist Latino bent, a bit of the Shamrock. Really I prefer this to the Crying Game. In that we have a real good first sequence with Forest Whittaker, the best actor of the film dies in the beginning, and then it's all anti-climax. Here we get the unique mixing of an Irish-Guatemalan relationship, a sleazy NYC hotel sequence, the Midnight Cowboy type alienation of a man alone in New York, and the great Alfred Molina (We've seen him as an Iranian, a Greek,now a Guatemalan...and he's British to boot.) So overlook the flaws of the film and enjoy it for what it is. The only real flaws are that some things are disturbingly unexplained: Why was Rea a prisoner to begin with, The Guatemalan Death squad thing in the post-cold war Clinton era, and what was up with that chick in the hotel?! Finally, does Stephen Rea remind you of Bob Geldof in The Wall or what!

    I found this to be a very good movie. It is an interesting story. All the actors are good. Stephan Rea is always good as he exemplifies such wonderful sensitivity and gravity in his characterization. Rosana Pastor is one of my favorite actresses after seeing this, so very beautiful in looks as well as spirit.

    In "The Crying Game," Neil Jordan and Stephen Rea combined to create a masterful, suspenseful thriller. However, "The Break" fails to reproduce that effect, ultimately resulting in a disappointing film. After an intriguing opening sequence, in which Rea, as an Irish terrorist (surprised?), breaks out of prison, the movie really has nowhere to go. Ronan Bennett's screenplay tries to tell the sympathetic tale of a complex man attempting to go straight. The concept is good, but the movie gets bogged down in a poor relationship and runs into a complete dead end halfway through. Of course, Rea eventually returns to his terrorist techniques, this time to help the woman kill an oppressive Spanish general, or something ridiculous like that. The movie simply doesn't have any firepower in the second half. The audience doesn't care about Rea's character. If you want to see a terrific movie with powerful performances and a fascinating story, check out "The Crying Game." Twice, instead of this once.

    Seems when a movie starts with a prison break, the story predictably goes in one of two directions. (1) Our protagonist has a big score already planned, and all the resources are at his fingertips. He's upbeat and optimistic. The air of freedom, albeit temporary, smells good. Or, (2) He looks toward a redemptive arc. Probably he finds a good woman in the most unlikely of places, and strives to go, with her, toward a better end. He will meet with some success, only to find a prohibitive obstacle in his path. I mean we can't let a guy escape from prison and get away clean, can we? In Â‘The Break' (USA title) Stephen Rea again does a masterful job of underplaying the character of Sean Dowd, trying option #2 on for size. He breaks out of an Irish prison, then relocates to New York, where he works in an obscure restaurant washing dishes. The story then follows a rather predictable path, with a somewhat surprising ending. Director Roger Dornhelm does a good job keeping the film on track. Overall a solid thriller.
