 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloween Town, is bored with doing the same thing every year for Halloween. One day he stumbles into Christmas Town, and is so taken with the idea of Christmas that he tries to get the resident bats, ghouls, and goblins of Halloween town to help him put on Christmas instead of Halloween -- but alas, they can't get it quite right.

    We've seen quite a bit of stop-motion animation on television, with all of those holiday specials we see every Christmas, and of course, the infamous Wallace and Gromit shorts by filmmaker Nick Park in the U.K. However, in the 1990s, we haven't seen a whole lot of stop-motion animation on the big screen. In fact, we rarely saw that. However, one little film came to theatres in 1993 produced by "Batman" director Tim Burton and directed by then-newcomer Henry Selick (who would later make "Coraline") that really caught our attention. That film was "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas". The movie focuses around Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, who is tired of doing the same old celebration in Halloween Town year after year, as illustrated and interpreted in the film's second musical number. That's right. This is a musical. He wanders out of Halloween Town to find something new, until he stumbles upon a series of holiday doors in the middle of the forest. The one that catches his eye is a door in the shape of a tree. A Christmas tree as a matter of fact. He opens the door, only to be literally sucked in and discovers Christmas town. Fascinated by his discovery, he tells the citizens of Halloween Town all about it, and comes up with the idea of taking over Christmas this year. What happens after that I will not tell, because there are a certain number of people who have not even seen this fantastic movie yet. Let me make it clear, if the 10/10 score isn't clear enough already if you looked under the summary. I absolutely love this movie. A lot. In fact, it's within the top 10 of my all time favorite movies list (which I have not fully completed yet). Every year since I've gotten the Special Edition DVD at age 15, I've watched this movie numerous times every year, and it still has not gotten old. Even though I never got the opportunity to watch this movie at a younger age (for some reason -.-), waiting until I got my hands on the DVD disc paid off nicely. The structure of the sets and characters are absolutely brilliant and morbid for a stop-motion picture. A lot of care went into the making of this motion picture milestone, even if Tim Burton was absent most of the time. The reason for that was he was directing "Batman Returns" for Warner Brothers and he was also in pre-production for the R-rated drama "Ed Wood", which would also be released by Touchstone. So, because of this, it was director Henry Selick's job to make sure that Tim Burton's vision was alive and well during production. The result, a movie that defined the mind of Tim Burton as a whole. The music and songs, both done by former Oingo-Boingo front man and film composer Danny Elfman are also the highlight of the film besides the animation and visuals. There are 10 songs in total, and they are performed brilliantly. Danny Elfman also provides the singing voice of Jack Skellington. The music is celebrated to the point where in 2008, Walt Disney Records released a compilation album entitled "Nightmare Revisited", with all the songs and motion picture score performed by popular and independent acts, including the likes of Marilyn Manson, Korn, Rise Against, and the All-American Rejects (don't worry parents, it's family-friendly). Bizarre as it is, the compilation is definitely worth a buy if you love the film as much as I do. Today, 20 years later as of this review post, the film still holds up really well. Merchandise went up the wazoo, video games were made, and it even garnered a cult following. Whether you are watching it in 2D or 3D, chances are, you're gonna get the same reaction of amazement on how far we've gotten with filmmaking technology. Back then, animated films didn't solely rely on computer generated images to wow audiences. Craftsmanship and imagination were needed to make a film that can captivate the movie-going public. Granted, this doesn't always mark every single film a success, but in this case, it's what made it a classic. The film may have a few faults, which are really very small nitpicks, but it does not hurt the film one bit. This movie is still fun to watch, and it can be best viewed on Halloween and Christmas. That's right. It's not just a Christmas movie. It's a Halloween treat as well. If you haven't seen this film once in your life, you owe it to yourself to find a DVD/Blu-Ray copy of this movie. If you have kids, it's even better. Before I end this review, I must mention that Disney first released this film under their more adult subsidiary Touchstone Pictures, because they thought the movie would be too scary for younger audiences. In fact, it's what got it the PG rating. Ironically, this is the same studio that released a lesser known horror film called "The Watcher in the Woods". What they didn't realize is that kids eat this stuff up like Halloween candy. It wouldn't be until the 3D re-release when Disney themselves would distribute the film.

    Just about everyone considers this Burton's best film. First, he didn't direct this, he wrote and produced this. Second, it's really not that great. I still like it. There are great sights, funny bits, and memorable characters. The characters like Jack Skellington and Sally play off the dark quirkiness so well. However, there are still some complaints I have. The film should have been 15-20 minutes longer than it really is. I strongly feel more of the characters could've been better developed. Dr. Finkelstein was fun to watch but he needed more emotions besides angry. Santa Claus was surprisingly underused. And Oogie-Boogie, who is supposed to be the main antagonist, seemed to have come out nowhere with no build-up at all. It always bothers that he wasn't handled better. Also, except for "This is Halloween" and "What's This?", most of the songs were forgettable. Despite these flaws, I still recommend this for the holidays (or Halloween).

    A beautifully creepy brief movie, were we get a first glimpse of Henry Selick, odd and fascinating thoughts. Tim Burton is as well known for his most unusual ideas, the character and picture we get to familiar ourselves with in this movie is unquestionably deviant. The animation was somewhat new to me, odd, pointy, squeaky eyes, long, short, scary, unlike anything else i could imagine, but i cherished every second of it. I'm not certain what kind of audience they were aiming towards, i can only imagine a child would be frightened by this kind of animation and atmosphere. This movie has to rely a lot on the music involved, so choosing the right composer who is experienced in the spooky/Goth themes is important, Danny Elfman has worked with this before and showed that he is competent enough, and was the perfect choice. Jack, our main character, lives in a Gothic world with monsters and nightmares, were death is around the corner. He stumbles upon this colorful world, which opposite to what he's used to (which is dull colors) this world consists of cheerful, living people and a colorful environment. Jack is a unhappy, dead, creature which feels emptiness and is searching for something unknown, jack, despite being a monster, he only wants to contribute and do good deeds, but doesn't realize they aren't so good after all. One can speculate if there is a moral of this story, i believe that its about not trying to change yourself, and accept yourself for who you are.

    This long animation from Tim Burton is already considered a cult classic and surely a reference from this director. It's visually stunning and it creates characters and "worlds" that can only truly exist in Tim Burton's mindÂ… and it is, in my perspective, its most valuable feature. The plot is very simple and straight to follow but in fact it's what matters the less! The scenarios, the colors, the strange characters, the black humor and its final message are what really matter in this long animation! I think it's a good movie in its particular genreÂ… Just to make notice I watched the 3D version. I score it 7/10.

    I don't know a single person who doesn't love this movie. Tim Burton nailed this one in my eyes, and this is the movie that introduced my generation to him and to claymation as well. I was very young when this movie came out, and yes it scared me but it was the greatest movie ever. This the go-to movie when it's time for Halloween, and Christmas as well, to get you in the spirit! The soundtrack is gold and every song is fantastic and you know most of the words from the first time you see it. It has been almost 20 years since it came out and it still has a cult following, a mega franchise and screaming fans of all ages. Disney was right to pick up the rights for this movie because I guarantee you it has done nothing but given them more money for years to come. It may scare very small children but they will either get over it or come to love it in a couple of years.

    This movie is an all around masterpiece. Burton expresses his wild and beautiful imagination in this vivid and expertly crafted stop motion musical based off of an original poem he wrote. It has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remember, and it's very easy to watch over and over again. It's a wonderful and heartfelt story of discovering one's destiny, and fulfilling dreams. The single most amazing film I have ever seen. I recommend this film to anyone who easily accepts artistic viewing material, and is up for the dark implications of the setting and characters. A fantastic film that is good for any circumstances, whether the viewers be having a date night, sleepover, family movie night, party, or any other setting.

    The Nightmare Before Christmas represents what one might argue to be the most famous and well known stopmotion film of all time. It's one of the few films that generally receive annual viewings, and it's often raved as Tim Burton's best film (despite actually being directed by Henry Selick). Even if this is a case of style over substance, I couldn't help but be enchanted by this visually stunning picture, and I feel this is truly worthy of its cult classic status. Jack Skellington, the hailed leader of Halloweenland wraps up yet another successful Halloween. The entire land loves him, and though Jack receives much adoration, he feels bored with his job, and wants something different. But when Jack accidentally finds himself in Christmastown, his life regains meaning. Loving what he sees, Jack attempts to imitate the holiday, though things go terribly wrong. I have to say, The Nightmare Before Christmas was much different than I expected. While I assumed this would be a dark musical comedy, there's actually very little humor to be found. You might get a few smiles, and maybe a laugh, but The Nightmare Before Christmas is by no means a comedy. It's spellbinding fantasy, that imitates the classic Disney formula, while becoming a genre all of its own. The primary strength of this film, comes from the imagination and the visuals. The story line and setting is highly original. While only Halloweenland and Christmastown is ever seen, we are lead to believe that there's other Holiday themed world as well. It makes one wonder what could await in other lands... As far as the visuals go, this is certainly one of the best looking films I've ever seen. While never overly complex or as technically astounding as modern stopmotion films, The Nightmare Before Christmas boasts a visual style like nothing I've ever seen before. The character designs are brilliant. The landscapes are stunning. The visuals are much of what makes The Nightmare Before Christmas such a famed classic, and that's no surprise. Halloweenland and it's residents are wonderfully wicked, and often more creepy than actually scary. The slightly twisted nature to the setting here is memorable and enchanting. Christmastown recalls memories from How the Grinch Stole Christmas, while providing a much more cheery color palette. Unfortunately, Danny Elfman's songs are less than great. In general, they're forgettable and lacking in fun, and the rhyme schemes are often awkward and hard to follow. The lyrics often seem to force words to rhyme, making the songs slightly unpleasant to listen to at times. This is a shame, because there are so many songs in the film. Still, there are still several good ones, including "This is Halloween," "Kidnap the Sandy Claws," and the phenomenal "What's This?" The cast is nothing too special. Chris Sarandon voices Jack Skellington when talking, while composer and song writer Danny Elfman voices Jack when he's singing. Catherine O'Hara lends a forgettable voice for Sally, the love interest. Ken Page as Oogie Boogie is easily the standout, providing an energetic performance as the main antagonist. While Danny Elfman's songs in the film left something to be desired, his score is, quite possibly, some of his very best work. With some surprisingly jazzy segments (that sounds so much like Randy Newman's work, it's uncanny), and some great recurring musical themes and Christmas tie-ins, this is an excellent and hugely memorable score from Elfman. The main selling point may be the visuals, but that doesn't make this film worth seeing for it's other aspects. The story is very original, Elfman's score is great, and the whole production has imagination to spare. The Nightmare Before Christmas isn't as emotionally satisfying or as hilarious as the best of animated films, but the visuals alone makes this worth seeing.

    Think of It As Rudolph Mixed In With The Works of Edward Gory

    I'll start this review off by saying that, even though this was one of the first movies I ever saw, I was pretty darn terrified of it. I would often watch this film at my cousins' house growing up in the mid 90s early 2000s timeframe and when the monster from under the bed with his sharp teeth and red eyes made his first appearance, I cried in fright and called for mother. But growing older, and increasingly fond of the works of Tim Burton, I have come to be obsessed with this film and now it's one of my all time favorites. I like to think of this film as a mixture between the works of Edward Gory, the Rankin Bass Christmas stop motions such as Rudolph, and the many Charlie Chaplin movies you can think of. I mean, come on! You can't deny that Jack Skellington moves a lot like Charlie Chaplin. He has that diverse style that parallels that of Chaplin, and it obviously took several thousand shots to make him move. In my eyes, The Nightmare Before Christmas is Tim Burton's macabre imagination at it's finest, and really bridges the gap between beloved holiday classics and twisted, dark style Halloween thrillers. The stop motion animation, what can be said about it that hasn't already be said a gazillion and a half times already? Director Henry Selick and his crew really put sweat and blood into this animation and as a result, gave us animation that has a very German expressionist vibe to it, much like silent films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and 1925's The Phantom of the Opera. I just love how the characters move, Jack especially, and that they move in such a stylized, non human way. After all, these characters live in a fantasy world, so they should move in a stylized fashion rather than a realistic fashion. The design of the characters is also something to write home about. Every character has their own unique look and no two look the same. From the slinky, slender design of Jack Skellington, to the wide, twisted look of the Mayor, each character has their own characteristics and mannerisms and stick out from one another like soar thumbs. Even jolly old Saint Nick himself has his own thing going on, giving us a look of Santa Claus we had never seen before. What I also dig about the film is the overall design and atmosphere. From the curved gravestones of Halloweentown, to the real world's crooked dwellings, everything is non linear and gives the film a storybook quality, making you feel like you're within a dream or nightmare or someone else's subconscious. Even Christmastown has a touch of rugged scenery, right down to Santa's workshop. I also must praise the camera angles and perspectives represented throughout the film. Many scenes are shot in silhouette or in darkness and add a sense or tension, remorse or suspense to whatever scene is taking place at that moment. The scene where Jack walks up the hill, silhouetted against the massive yellow moon is in my opinion one of the crowning moments of Tim Burton's movie career and is the most iconic piece of imagery out of the entire film. It's very much like how ET and Elliot were silhouetted against the moon in the bike flying scene in ET or how the Batwing was silhouetted against the moon to create the bat signal in Burton's Batman. The music by Danny Elfman is by far one of his best works, blending in humor as well as dark, twisted choices of words. Danny Elfman must also be praised for doing Jack Skellington's singing voice, adding great depth to the character's point of view and inner torment. I also enjoyed Ken Page as Oogie Bogie, a character who was obviously inspired by Cab Calloway and his appearance in a 1932 Betty Boop cartoon. He portrays the Boogeyman as a sick, villainous tyrant who really enjoys inflicting pain on others. He also enjoys snacking on small insects when he himself is basically a huge pile of insects in a sack. The Nightmare Before Christmas displays a style not seen too often, and really showcases what can be done when hard work and dedication is put into stop motion animation. It also shows that Tim Burton has a pretty dark, yet child friendly imagination in his brain and isn't afraid to let it spew onto film. In my eyes, it's his second best masterpiece next to Edward Scissorhands.

    My wife and two kids, boys aged 9 and 12, settled down together to watch this and at the halfway point we all agreed to bail on it. Part of the problem is that much of the explication is given in song, so unless you're on top of interpreting screechy singing voices you will be a bit lost. And I didn't really care about any of the characters ... there was a girl who was important somehow but I had no idea of what her motivation was. Her creator was a pretty good evil guy, though. My kids thought it was creepy, so I guess the film had some power, but just not the kind of power that would make us want to watch it.

    Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), king of Halloweentown, discovers Christmas Town, but does not quite understand the concept. I understand this is a modern Christmas classic, and as we approach the 20th anniversary, there will probably be a great deal of fanfare. I guess I just do not get it, though. While I enjoy the movie, love the songs (Danny Elfman is amazing) and think the animation is spectacular, it is unclear to me how it has the strong cult following it does or how it has made the Top 250 movies list. Maybe I am just rebelling because I instinctively dislike things that are popular. But I just am not clear on the mass appeal. If we consider this a Tim Burton film (and that is debatable), it is probably among his best work... but still not on the level of, say, the Batman films or "Beetlejuice". And those do not get the level of praise. Why?

    This long animation from Tim Burton is already considered a cult classic and surely a reference from this director. It's visually stunning and it creates characters and "worlds" that can only truly exist in Tim Burton's mindÂ… and it is, in my perspective, its most valuable feature. The plot is very simple and straight to follow but in fact it's what matters the less! The scenarios, the colors, the strange characters, the black humor and its final message are what really matter in this long animation! I think it's a good movie in its particular genreÂ… Just to make notice I watched the 3D version. I score it 7/10.

    I don't know a single person who doesn't love this movie. Tim Burton nailed this one in my eyes, and this is the movie that introduced my generation to him and to claymation as well. I was very young when this movie came out, and yes it scared me but it was the greatest movie ever. This the go-to movie when it's time for Halloween, and Christmas as well, to get you in the spirit! The soundtrack is gold and every song is fantastic and you know most of the words from the first time you see it. It has been almost 20 years since it came out and it still has a cult following, a mega franchise and screaming fans of all ages. Disney was right to pick up the rights for this movie because I guarantee you it has done nothing but given them more money for years to come. It may scare very small children but they will either get over it or come to love it in a couple of years.

    This movie is an all around masterpiece. Burton expresses his wild and beautiful imagination in this vivid and expertly crafted stop motion musical based off of an original poem he wrote. It has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remember, and it's very easy to watch over and over again. It's a wonderful and heartfelt story of discovering one's destiny, and fulfilling dreams. The single most amazing film I have ever seen. I recommend this film to anyone who easily accepts artistic viewing material, and is up for the dark implications of the setting and characters. A fantastic film that is good for any circumstances, whether the viewers be having a date night, sleepover, family movie night, party, or any other setting.

    The Nightmare Before Christmas represents what one might argue to be the most famous and well known stopmotion film of all time. It's one of the few films that generally receive annual viewings, and it's often raved as Tim Burton's best film (despite actually being directed by Henry Selick). Even if this is a case of style over substance, I couldn't help but be enchanted by this visually stunning picture, and I feel this is truly worthy of its cult classic status. Jack Skellington, the hailed leader of Halloweenland wraps up yet another successful Halloween. The entire land loves him, and though Jack receives much adoration, he feels bored with his job, and wants something different. But when Jack accidentally finds himself in Christmastown, his life regains meaning. Loving what he sees, Jack attempts to imitate the holiday, though things go terribly wrong. I have to say, The Nightmare Before Christmas was much different than I expected. While I assumed this would be a dark musical comedy, there's actually very little humor to be found. You might get a few smiles, and maybe a laugh, but The Nightmare Before Christmas is by no means a comedy. It's spellbinding fantasy, that imitates the classic Disney formula, while becoming a genre all of its own. The primary strength of this film, comes from the imagination and the visuals. The story line and setting is highly original. While only Halloweenland and Christmastown is ever seen, we are lead to believe that there's other Holiday themed world as well. It makes one wonder what could await in other lands... As far as the visuals go, this is certainly one of the best looking films I've ever seen. While never overly complex or as technically astounding as modern stopmotion films, The Nightmare Before Christmas boasts a visual style like nothing I've ever seen before. The character designs are brilliant. The landscapes are stunning. The visuals are much of what makes The Nightmare Before Christmas such a famed classic, and that's no surprise. Halloweenland and it's residents are wonderfully wicked, and often more creepy than actually scary. The slightly twisted nature to the setting here is memorable and enchanting. Christmastown recalls memories from How the Grinch Stole Christmas, while providing a much more cheery color palette. Unfortunately, Danny Elfman's songs are less than great. In general, they're forgettable and lacking in fun, and the rhyme schemes are often awkward and hard to follow. The lyrics often seem to force words to rhyme, making the songs slightly unpleasant to listen to at times. This is a shame, because there are so many songs in the film. Still, there are still several good ones, including "This is Halloween," "Kidnap the Sandy Claws," and the phenomenal "What's This?" The cast is nothing too special. Chris Sarandon voices Jack Skellington when talking, while composer and song writer Danny Elfman voices Jack when he's singing. Catherine O'Hara lends a forgettable voice for Sally, the love interest. Ken Page as Oogie Boogie is easily the standout, providing an energetic performance as the main antagonist. While Danny Elfman's songs in the film left something to be desired, his score is, quite possibly, some of his very best work. With some surprisingly jazzy segments (that sounds so much like Randy Newman's work, it's uncanny), and some great recurring musical themes and Christmas tie-ins, this is an excellent and hugely memorable score from Elfman. The main selling point may be the visuals, but that doesn't make this film worth seeing for it's other aspects. The story is very original, Elfman's score is great, and the whole production has imagination to spare. The Nightmare Before Christmas isn't as emotionally satisfying or as hilarious as the best of animated films, but the visuals alone makes this worth seeing.

    I'll start this review off by saying that, even though this was one of the first movies I ever saw, I was pretty darn terrified of it. I would often watch this film at my cousins' house growing up in the mid 90s early 2000s timeframe and when the monster from under the bed with his sharp teeth and red eyes made his first appearance, I cried in fright and called for mother. But growing older, and increasingly fond of the works of Tim Burton, I have come to be obsessed with this film and now it's one of my all time favorites. I like to think of this film as a mixture between the works of Edward Gory, the Rankin Bass Christmas stop motions such as Rudolph, and the many Charlie Chaplin movies you can think of. I mean, come on! You can't deny that Jack Skellington moves a lot like Charlie Chaplin. He has that diverse style that parallels that of Chaplin, and it obviously took several thousand shots to make him move. In my eyes, The Nightmare Before Christmas is Tim Burton's macabre imagination at it's finest, and really bridges the gap between beloved holiday classics and twisted, dark style Halloween thrillers. The stop motion animation, what can be said about it that hasn't already be said a gazillion and a half times already? Director Henry Selick and his crew really put sweat and blood into this animation and as a result, gave us animation that has a very German expressionist vibe to it, much like silent films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and 1925's The Phantom of the Opera. I just love how the characters move, Jack especially, and that they move in such a stylized, non human way. After all, these characters live in a fantasy world, so they should move in a stylized fashion rather than a realistic fashion. The design of the characters is also something to write home about. Every character has their own unique look and no two look the same. From the slinky, slender design of Jack Skellington, to the wide, twisted look of the Mayor, each character has their own characteristics and mannerisms and stick out from one another like soar thumbs. Even jolly old Saint Nick himself has his own thing going on, giving us a look of Santa Claus we had never seen before. What I also dig about the film is the overall design and atmosphere. From the curved gravestones of Halloweentown, to the real world's crooked dwellings, everything is non linear and gives the film a storybook quality, making you feel like you're within a dream or nightmare or someone else's subconscious. Even Christmastown has a touch of rugged scenery, right down to Santa's workshop. I also must praise the camera angles and perspectives represented throughout the film. Many scenes are shot in silhouette or in darkness and add a sense or tension, remorse or suspense to whatever scene is taking place at that moment. The scene where Jack walks up the hill, silhouetted against the massive yellow moon is in my opinion one of the crowning moments of Tim Burton's movie career and is the most iconic piece of imagery out of the entire film. It's very much like how ET and Elliot were silhouetted against the moon in the bike flying scene in ET or how the Batwing was silhouetted against the moon to create the bat signal in Burton's Batman. The music by Danny Elfman is by far one of his best works, blending in humor as well as dark, twisted choices of words. Danny Elfman must also be praised for doing Jack Skellington's singing voice, adding great depth to the character's point of view and inner torment. I also enjoyed Ken Page as Oogie Bogie, a character who was obviously inspired by Cab Calloway and his appearance in a 1932 Betty Boop cartoon. He portrays the Boogeyman as a sick, villainous tyrant who really enjoys inflicting pain on others. He also enjoys snacking on small insects when he himself is basically a huge pile of insects in a sack. The Nightmare Before Christmas displays a style not seen too often, and really showcases what can be done when hard work and dedication is put into stop motion animation. It also shows that Tim Burton has a pretty dark, yet child friendly imagination in his brain and isn't afraid to let it spew onto film. In my eyes, it's his second best masterpiece next to Edward Scissorhands.

    My wife and two kids, boys aged 9 and 12, settled down together to watch this and at the halfway point we all agreed to bail on it. Part of the problem is that much of the explication is given in song, so unless you're on top of interpreting screechy singing voices you will be a bit lost. And I didn't really care about any of the characters ... there was a girl who was important somehow but I had no idea of what her motivation was. Her creator was a pretty good evil guy, though. My kids thought it was creepy, so I guess the film had some power, but just not the kind of power that would make us want to watch it.

    Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), king of Halloweentown, discovers Christmas Town, but does not quite understand the concept. I understand this is a modern Christmas classic, and as we approach the 20th anniversary, there will probably be a great deal of fanfare. I guess I just do not get it, though. While I enjoy the movie, love the songs (Danny Elfman is amazing) and think the animation is spectacular, it is unclear to me how it has the strong cult following it does or how it has made the Top 250 movies list. Maybe I am just rebelling because I instinctively dislike things that are popular. But I just am not clear on the mass appeal. If we consider this a Tim Burton film (and that is debatable), it is probably among his best work... but still not on the level of, say, the Batman films or "Beetlejuice". And those do not get the level of praise. Why?

    We've seen quite a bit of stop-motion animation on television, with all of those holiday specials we see every Christmas, and of course, the infamous Wallace and Gromit shorts by filmmaker Nick Park in the U.K. However, in the 1990s, we haven't seen a whole lot of stop-motion animation on the big screen. In fact, we rarely saw that. However, one little film came to theatres in 1993 produced by "Batman" director Tim Burton and directed by then-newcomer Henry Selick (who would later make "Coraline") that really caught our attention. That film was "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas". The movie focuses around Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, who is tired of doing the same old celebration in Halloween Town year after year, as illustrated and interpreted in the film's second musical number. That's right. This is a musical. He wanders out of Halloween Town to find something new, until he stumbles upon a series of holiday doors in the middle of the forest. The one that catches his eye is a door in the shape of a tree. A Christmas tree as a matter of fact. He opens the door, only to be literally sucked in and discovers Christmas town. Fascinated by his discovery, he tells the citizens of Halloween Town all about it, and comes up with the idea of taking over Christmas this year. What happens after that I will not tell, because there are a certain number of people who have not even seen this fantastic movie yet. Let me make it clear, if the 10/10 score isn't clear enough already if you looked under the summary. I absolutely love this movie. A lot. In fact, it's within the top 10 of my all time favorite movies list (which I have not fully completed yet). Every year since I've gotten the Special Edition DVD at age 15, I've watched this movie numerous times every year, and it still has not gotten old. Even though I never got the opportunity to watch this movie at a younger age (for some reason -.-), waiting until I got my hands on the DVD disc paid off nicely. The structure of the sets and characters are absolutely brilliant and morbid for a stop-motion picture. A lot of care went into the making of this motion picture milestone, even if Tim Burton was absent most of the time. The reason for that was he was directing "Batman Returns" for Warner Brothers and he was also in pre-production for the R-rated drama "Ed Wood", which would also be released by Touchstone. So, because of this, it was director Henry Selick's job to make sure that Tim Burton's vision was alive and well during production. The result, a movie that defined the mind of Tim Burton as a whole. The music and songs, both done by former Oingo-Boingo front man and film composer Danny Elfman are also the highlight of the film besides the animation and visuals. There are 10 songs in total, and they are performed brilliantly. Danny Elfman also provides the singing voice of Jack Skellington. The music is celebrated to the point where in 2008, Walt Disney Records released a compilation album entitled "Nightmare Revisited", with all the songs and motion picture score performed by popular and independent acts, including the likes of Marilyn Manson, Korn, Rise Against, and the All-American Rejects (don't worry parents, it's family-friendly). Bizarre as it is, the compilation is definitely worth a buy if you love the film as much as I do. Today, 20 years later as of this review post, the film still holds up really well. Merchandise went up the wazoo, video games were made, and it even garnered a cult following. Whether you are watching it in 2D or 3D, chances are, you're gonna get the same reaction of amazement on how far we've gotten with filmmaking technology. Back then, animated films didn't solely rely on computer generated images to wow audiences. Craftsmanship and imagination were needed to make a film that can captivate the movie-going public. Granted, this doesn't always mark every single film a success, but in this case, it's what made it a classic. The film may have a few faults, which are really very small nitpicks, but it does not hurt the film one bit. This movie is still fun to watch, and it can be best viewed on Halloween and Christmas. That's right. It's not just a Christmas movie. It's a Halloween treat as well. If you haven't seen this film once in your life, you owe it to yourself to find a DVD/Blu-Ray copy of this movie. If you have kids, it's even better. Before I end this review, I must mention that Disney first released this film under their more adult subsidiary Touchstone Pictures, because they thought the movie would be too scary for younger audiences. In fact, it's what got it the PG rating. Ironically, this is the same studio that released a lesser known horror film called "The Watcher in the Woods". What they didn't realize is that kids eat this stuff up like Halloween candy. It wouldn't be until the 3D re-release when Disney themselves would distribute the film.

    Just about everyone considers this Burton's best film. First, he didn't direct this, he wrote and produced this. Second, it's really not that great. I still like it. There are great sights, funny bits, and memorable characters. The characters like Jack Skellington and Sally play off the dark quirkiness so well. However, there are still some complaints I have. The film should have been 15-20 minutes longer than it really is. I strongly feel more of the characters could've been better developed. Dr. Finkelstein was fun to watch but he needed more emotions besides angry. Santa Claus was surprisingly underused. And Oogie-Boogie, who is supposed to be the main antagonist, seemed to have come out nowhere with no build-up at all. It always bothers that he wasn't handled better. Also, except for "This is Halloween" and "What's This?", most of the songs were forgettable. Despite these flaws, I still recommend this for the holidays (or Halloween).

    A beautifully creepy brief movie, were we get a first glimpse of Henry Selick, odd and fascinating thoughts. Tim Burton is as well known for his most unusual ideas, the character and picture we get to familiar ourselves with in this movie is unquestionably deviant. The animation was somewhat new to me, odd, pointy, squeaky eyes, long, short, scary, unlike anything else i could imagine, but i cherished every second of it. I'm not certain what kind of audience they were aiming towards, i can only imagine a child would be frightened by this kind of animation and atmosphere. This movie has to rely a lot on the music involved, so choosing the right composer who is experienced in the spooky/Goth themes is important, Danny Elfman has worked with this before and showed that he is competent enough, and was the perfect choice. Jack, our main character, lives in a Gothic world with monsters and nightmares, were death is around the corner. He stumbles upon this colorful world, which opposite to what he's used to (which is dull colors) this world consists of cheerful, living people and a colorful environment. Jack is a unhappy, dead, creature which feels emptiness and is searching for something unknown, jack, despite being a monster, he only wants to contribute and do good deeds, but doesn't realize they aren't so good after all. One can speculate if there is a moral of this story, i believe that its about not trying to change yourself, and accept yourself for who you are.

The music by Danny Elfman is by far one of his best works, blending in humor as well as dark, twisted choices of words. Danny Elfman must also be praised for doing Jack Skellington's singing voice, adding great depth to the character's point of view and inner torment. I also enjoyed Ken Page as Oogie Bogie, a character who was obviously inspired by Cab Calloway and his appearance in a 1932 Betty Boop cartoon. He portrays the Boogeyman as a sick, villainous tyrant who really enjoys inflicting pain on others. He also enjoys snacking on small insects when he himself is basically a huge pile of insects in a sack. The Nightmare Before Christmas displays a style not seen too often, and really showcases what can be done when hard work and dedication is put into stop motion animation. It also shows that Tim Burton has a pretty dark, yet child friendly imagination in his brain and isn't afraid to let it spew onto film. In my eyes, it's his second best masterpiece next to Edward Scissorhands.

    My wife and two kids, boys aged 9 and 12, settled down together to watch this and at the halfway point we all agreed to bail on it. Part of the problem is that much of the explication is given in song, so unless you're on top of interpreting screechy singing voices you will be a bit lost. And I didn't really care about any of the characters ... there was a girl who was important somehow but I had no idea of what her motivation was. Her creator was a pretty good evil guy, though. My kids thought it was creepy, so I guess the film had some power, but just not the kind of power that would make us want to watch it.

    Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), king of Halloweentown, discovers Christmas Town, but does not quite understand the concept. I understand this is a modern Christmas classic, and as we approach the 20th anniversary, there will probably be a great deal of fanfare. I guess I just do not get it, though. While I enjoy the movie, love the songs (Danny Elfman is amazing) and think the animation is spectacular, it is unclear to me how it has the strong cult following it does or how it has made the Top 250 movies list. Maybe I am just rebelling because I instinctively dislike things that are popular. But I just am not clear on the mass appeal. If we consider this a Tim Burton film (and that is debatable), it is probably among his best work... but still not on the level of, say, the Batman films or "Beetlejuice". And those do not get the level of praise. Why?

    We've seen quite a bit of stop-motion animation on television, with all of those holiday specials we see every Christmas, and of course, the infamous Wallace and Gromit shorts by filmmaker Nick Park in the U.K. However, in the 1990s, we haven't seen a whole lot of stop-motion animation on the big screen. In fact, we rarely saw that. However, one little film came to theatres in 1993 produced by "Batman" director Tim Burton and directed by then-newcomer Henry Selick (who would later make "Coraline") that really caught our attention. That film was "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas". The movie focuses around Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, who is tired of doing the same old celebration in Halloween Town year after year, as illustrated and interpreted in the film's second musical number. That's right. This is a musical. He wanders out of Halloween Town to find something new, until he stumbles upon a series of holiday doors in the middle of the forest. The one that catches his eye is a door in the shape of a tree. A Christmas tree as a matter of fact. He opens the door, only to be literally sucked in and discovers Christmas town. Fascinated by his discovery, he tells the citizens of Halloween Town all about it, and comes up with the idea of taking over Christmas this year. What happens after that I will not tell, because there are a certain number of people who have not even seen this fantastic movie yet. Let me make it clear, if the 10/10 score isn't clear enough already if you looked under the summary. I absolutely love this movie. A lot. In fact, it's within the top 10 of my all time favorite movies list (which I have not fully completed yet). Every year since I've gotten the Special Edition DVD at age 15, I've watched this movie numerous times every year, and it still has not gotten old. Even though I never got the opportunity to watch this movie at a younger age (for some reason -.-), waiting until I got my hands on the DVD disc paid off nicely. The structure of the sets and characters are absolutely brilliant and morbid for a stop-motion picture. A lot of care went into the making of this motion picture milestone, even if Tim Burton was absent most of the time. The reason for that was he was directing "Batman Returns" for Warner Brothers and he was also in pre-production for the R-rated drama "Ed Wood", which would also be released by Touchstone. So, because of this, it was director Henry Selick's job to make sure that Tim Burton's vision was alive and well during production. The result, a movie that defined the mind of Tim Burton as a whole. The music and songs, both done by former Oingo-Boingo front man and film composer Danny Elfman are also the highlight of the film besides the animation and visuals. There are 10 songs in total, and they are performed brilliantly. Danny Elfman also provides the singing voice of Jack Skellington. The music is celebrated to the point where in 2008, Walt Disney Records released a compilation album entitled "Nightmare Revisited", with all the songs and motion picture score performed by popular and independent acts, including the likes of Marilyn Manson, Korn, Rise Against, and the All-American Rejects (don't worry parents, it's family-friendly). Bizarre as it is, the compilation is definitely worth a buy if you love the film as much as I do. Today, 20 years later as of this review post, the film still holds up really well. Merchandise went up the wazoo, video games were made, and it even garnered a cult following. Whether you are watching it in 2D or 3D, chances are, you're gonna get the same reaction of amazement on how far we've gotten with filmmaking technology. Back then, animated films didn't solely rely on computer generated images to wow audiences. Craftsmanship and imagination were needed to make a film that can captivate the movie-going public. Granted, this doesn't always mark every single film a success, but in this case, it's what made it a classic. The film may have a few faults, which are really very small nitpicks, but it does not hurt the film one bit. This movie is still fun to watch, and it can be best viewed on Halloween and Christmas. That's right. It's not just a Christmas movie. It's a Halloween treat as well. If you haven't seen this film once in your life, you owe it to yourself to find a DVD/Blu-Ray copy of this movie. If you have kids, it's even better. Before I end this review, I must mention that Disney first released this film under their more adult subsidiary Touchstone Pictures, because they thought the movie would be too scary for younger audiences. In fact, it's what got it the PG rating. Ironically, this is the same studio that released a lesser known horror film called "The Watcher in the Woods". What they didn't realize is that kids eat this stuff up like Halloween candy. It wouldn't be until the 3D re-release when Disney themselves would distribute the film.

    Just about everyone considers this Burton's best film. First, he didn't direct this, he wrote and produced this. Second, it's really not that great. I still like it. There are great sights, funny bits, and memorable characters. The characters like Jack Skellington and Sally play off the dark quirkiness so well. However, there are still some complaints I have. The film should have been 15-20 minutes longer than it really is. I strongly feel more of the characters could've been better developed. Dr. Finkelstein was fun to watch but he needed more emotions besides angry. Santa Claus was surprisingly underused. And Oogie-Boogie, who is supposed to be the main antagonist, seemed to have come out nowhere with no build-up at all. It always bothers that he wasn't handled better. Also, except for "This is Halloween" and "What's This?", most of the songs were forgettable. Despite these flaws, I still recommend this for the holidays (or Halloween).

    A beautifully creepy brief movie, were we get a first glimpse of Henry Selick, odd and fascinating thoughts. Tim Burton is as well known for his most unusual ideas, the character and picture we get to familiar ourselves with in this movie is unquestionably deviant. The animation was somewhat new to me, odd, pointy, squeaky eyes, long, short, scary, unlike anything else i could imagine, but i cherished every second of it. I'm not certain what kind of audience they were aiming towards, i can only imagine a child would be frightened by this kind of animation and atmosphere. This movie has to rely a lot on the music involved, so choosing the right composer who is experienced in the spooky/Goth themes is important, Danny Elfman has worked with this before and showed that he is competent enough, and was the perfect choice. Jack, our main character, lives in a Gothic world with monsters and nightmares, were death is around the corner. He stumbles upon this colorful world, which opposite to what he's used to (which is dull colors) this world consists of cheerful, living people and a colorful environment. Jack is a unhappy, dead, creature which feels emptiness and is searching for something unknown, jack, despite being a monster, he only wants to contribute and do good deeds, but doesn't realize they aren't so good after all. One can speculate if there is a moral of this story, i believe that its about not trying to change yourself, and accept yourself for who you are.

    This long animation from Tim Burton is already considered a cult classic and surely a reference from this director. It's visually stunning and it creates characters and "worlds" that can only truly exist in Tim Burton's mindÂ… and it is, in my perspective, its most valuable feature. The plot is very simple and straight to follow but in fact it's what matters the less! The scenarios, the colors, the strange characters, the black humor and its final message are what really matter in this long animation! I think it's a good movie in its particular genreÂ… Just to make notice I watched the 3D version. I score it 7/10.

    I don't know a single person who doesn't love this movie. Tim Burton nailed this one in my eyes, and this is the movie that introduced my generation to him and to claymation as well. I was very young when this movie came out, and yes it scared me but it was the greatest movie ever. This the go-to movie when it's time for Halloween, and Christmas as well, to get you in the spirit! The soundtrack is gold and every song is fantastic and you know most of the words from the first time you see it. It has been almost 20 years since it came out and it still has a cult following, a mega franchise and screaming fans of all ages. Disney was right to pick up the rights for this movie because I guarantee you it has done nothing but given them more money for years to come. It may scare very small children but they will either get over it or come to love it in a couple of years.

    This movie is an all around masterpiece. Burton expresses his wild and beautiful imagination in this vivid and expertly crafted stop motion musical based off of an original poem he wrote. It has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remember, and it's very easy to watch over and over again. It's a wonderful and heartfelt story of discovering one's destiny, and fulfilling dreams. The single most amazing film I have ever seen. I recommend this film to anyone who easily accepts artistic viewing material, and is up for the dark implications of the setting and characters. A fantastic film that is good for any circumstances, whether the viewers be having a date night, sleepover, family movie night, party, or any other setting.

    The Nightmare Before Christmas represents what one might argue to be the most famous and well known stopmotion film of all time. It's one of the few films that generally receive annual viewings, and it's often raved as Tim Burton's best film (despite actually being directed by Henry Selick). Even if this is a case of style over substance, I couldn't help but be enchanted by this visually stunning picture, and I feel this is truly worthy of its cult classic status. Jack Skellington, the hailed leader of Halloweenland wraps up yet another successful Halloween. The entire land loves him, and though Jack receives much adoration, he feels bored with his job, and wants something different. But when Jack accidentally finds himself in Christmastown, his life regains meaning. Loving what he sees, Jack attempts to imitate the holiday, though things go terribly wrong. I have to say, The Nightmare Before Christmas was much different than I expected. While I assumed this would be a dark musical comedy, there's actually very little humor to be found. You might get a few smiles, and maybe a laugh, but The Nightmare Before Christmas is by no means a comedy. It's spellbinding fantasy, that imitates the classic Disney formula, while becoming a genre all of its own. The primary strength of this film, comes from the imagination and the visuals. The story line and setting is highly original. While only Halloweenland and Christmastown is ever seen, we are lead to believe that there's other Holiday themed world as well. It makes one wonder what could await in other lands... As far as the visuals go, this is certainly one of the best looking films I've ever seen. While never overly complex or as technically astounding as modern stopmotion films, The Nightmare Before Christmas boasts a visual style like nothing I've ever seen before. The character designs are brilliant. The landscapes are stunning. The visuals are much of what makes The Nightmare Before Christmas such a famed classic, and that's no surprise. Halloweenland and it's residents are wonderfully wicked, and often more creepy than actually scary. The slightly twisted nature to the setting here is memorable and enchanting. Christmastown recalls memories from How the Grinch Stole Christmas, while providing a much more cheery color palette. Unfortunately, Danny Elfman's songs are less than great. In general, they're forgettable and lacking in fun, and the rhyme schemes are often awkward and hard to follow. The lyrics often seem to force words to rhyme, making the songs slightly unpleasant to listen to at times. This is a shame, because there are so many songs in the film. Still, there are still several good ones, including "This is Halloween," "Kidnap the Sandy Claws," and the phenomenal "What's This?" The cast is nothing too special. Chris Sarandon voices Jack Skellington when talking, while composer and song writer Danny Elfman voices Jack when he's singing. Catherine O'Hara lends a forgettable voice for Sally, the love interest. Ken Page as Oogie Boogie is easily the standout, providing an energetic performance as the main antagonist. While Danny Elfman's songs in the film left something to be desired, his score is, quite possibly, some of his very best work. With some surprisingly jazzy segments (that sounds so much like Randy Newman's work, it's uncanny), and some great recurring musical themes and Christmas tie-ins, this is an excellent and hugely memorable score from Elfman. The main selling point may be the visuals, but that doesn't make this film worth seeing for it's other aspects. The story is very original, Elfman's score is great, and the whole production has imagination to spare. The Nightmare Before Christmas isn't as emotionally satisfying or as hilarious as the best of animated films, but the visuals alone makes this worth seeing.

    Think of It As Rudolph Mixed In With The Works of Edward Gory

    I'll start this review off by saying that, even though this was one of the first movies I ever saw, I was pretty darn terrified of it. I would often watch this film at my cousins' house growing up in the mid 90s early 2000s timeframe and when the monster from under the bed with his sharp teeth and red eyes made his first appearance, I cried in fright and called for mother. But growing older, and increasingly fond of the works of Tim Burton, I have come to be obsessed with this film and now it's one of my all time favorites. I like to think of this film as a mixture between the works of Edward Gory, the Rankin Bass Christmas stop motions such as Rudolph, and the many Charlie Chaplin movies you can think of. I mean, come on! You can't deny that Jack Skellington moves a lot like Charlie Chaplin. He has that diverse style that parallels that of Chaplin, and it obviously took several thousand shots to make him move. In my eyes, The Nightmare Before Christmas is Tim Burton's macabre imagination at it's finest, and really bridges the gap between beloved holiday classics and twisted, dark style Halloween thrillers. The stop motion animation, what can be said about it that hasn't already be said a gazillion and a half times already? Director Henry Selick and his crew really put sweat and blood into this animation and as a result, gave us animation that has a very German expressionist vibe to it, much like silent films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and 1925's The Phantom of the Opera. I just love how the characters move, Jack especially, and that they move in such a stylized, non human way. After all, these characters live in a fantasy world, so they should move in a stylized fashion rather than a realistic fashion. The design of the characters is also something to write home about. Every character has their own unique look and no two look the same. From the slinky, slender design of Jack Skellington, to the wide, twisted look of the Mayor, each character has their own characteristics and mannerisms and stick out from one another like soar thumbs. Even jolly old Saint Nick himself has his own thing going on, giving us a look of Santa Claus we had never seen before. What I also dig about the film is the overall design and atmosphere. From the curved gravestones of Halloweentown, to the real world's crooked dwellings, everything is non linear and gives the film a storybook quality, making you feel like you're within a dream or nightmare or someone else's subconscious. Even Christmastown has a touch of rugged scenery, right down to Santa's workshop. I also must praise the camera angles and perspectives represented throughout the film. Many scenes are shot in silhouette or in darkness and add a sense or tension, remorse or suspense to whatever scene is taking place at that moment. The scene where Jack walks up the hill, silhouetted against the massive yellow moon is in my opinion one of the crowning moments of Tim Burton's movie career and is the most iconic piece of imagery out of the entire film. It's very much like how ET and Elliot were silhouetted against the moon in the bike flying scene in ET or how the Batwing was silhouetted against the moon to create the bat signal in Burton's Batman. The music by Danny Elfman is by far one of his best works, blending in humor as well as dark, twisted choices of words. Danny Elfman must also be praised for doing Jack Skellington's singing voice, adding great depth to the character's point of view and inner torment. I also enjoyed Ken Page as Oogie Bogie, a character who was obviously inspired by Cab Calloway and his appearance in a 1932 Betty Boop cartoon. He portrays the Boogeyman as a sick, villainous tyrant who really enjoys inflicting pain on others. He also enjoys snacking on small insects when he himself is basically a huge pile of insects in a sack. The Nightmare Before Christmas displays a style not seen too often, and really showcases what can be done when hard work and dedication is put into stop motion animation. It also shows that Tim Burton has a pretty dark, yet child friendly imagination in his brain and isn't afraid to let it spew onto film. In my eyes, it's his second best masterpiece next to Edward Scissorhands.

    A beautifully creepy brief movie, were we get a first glimpse of Henry Selick, odd and fascinating thoughts. Tim Burton is as well known for his most unusual ideas, the character and picture we get to familiar ourselves with in this movie is unquestionably deviant. The animation was somewhat new to me, odd, pointy, squeaky eyes, long, short, scary, unlike anything else i could imagine, but i cherished every second of it. I'm not certain what kind of audience they were aiming towards, i can only imagine a child would be frightened by this kind of animation and atmosphere. This movie has to rely a lot on the music involved, so choosing the right composer who is experienced in the spooky/Goth themes is important, Danny Elfman has worked with this before and showed that he is competent enough, and was the perfect choice. Jack, our main character, lives in a Gothic world with monsters and nightmares, were death is around the corner. He stumbles upon this colorful world, which opposite to what he's used to (which is dull colors) this world consists of cheerful, living people and a colorful environment. Jack is a unhappy, dead, creature which feels emptiness and is searching for something unknown, jack, despite being a monster, he only wants to contribute and do good deeds, but doesn't realize they aren't so good after all. One can speculate if there is a moral of this story, i believe that its about not trying to change yourself, and accept yourself for who you are.

    This long animation from Tim Burton is already considered a cult classic and surely a reference from this director. It's visually stunning and it creates characters and "worlds" that can only truly exist in Tim Burton's mindÂ… and it is, in my perspective, its most valuable feature. The plot is very simple and straight to follow but in fact it's what matters the less! The scenarios, the colors, the strange characters, the black humor and its final message are what really matter in this long animation! I think it's a good movie in its particular genreÂ… Just to make notice I watched the 3D version. I score it 7/10.

    I don't know a single person who doesn't love this movie. Tim Burton nailed this one in my eyes, and this is the movie that introduced my generation to him and to claymation as well. I was very young when this movie came out, and yes it scared me but it was the greatest movie ever. This the go-to movie when it's time for Halloween, and Christmas as well, to get you in the spirit! The soundtrack is gold and every song is fantastic and you know most of the words from the first time you see it. It has been almost 20 years since it came out and it still has a cult following, a mega franchise and screaming fans of all ages. Disney was right to pick up the rights for this movie because I guarantee you it has done nothing but given them more money for years to come. It may scare very small children but they will either get over it or come to love it in a couple of years.

    This movie is an all around masterpiece. Burton expresses his wild and beautiful imagination in this vivid and expertly crafted stop motion musical based off of an original poem he wrote. It has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remember, and it's very easy to watch over and over again. It's a wonderful and heartfelt story of discovering one's destiny, and fulfilling dreams. The single most amazing film I have ever seen. I recommend this film to anyone who easily accepts artistic viewing material, and is up for the dark implications of the setting and characters. A fantastic film that is good for any circumstances, whether the viewers be having a date night, sleepover, family movie night, party, or any other setting.

    The Nightmare Before Christmas represents what one might argue to be the most famous and well known stopmotion film of all time. It's one of the few films that generally receive annual viewings, and it's often raved as Tim Burton's best film (despite actually being directed by Henry Selick). Even if this is a case of style over substance, I couldn't help but be enchanted by this visually stunning picture, and I feel this is truly worthy of its cult classic status. Jack Skellington, the hailed leader of Halloweenland wraps up yet another successful Halloween. The entire land loves him, and though Jack receives much adoration, he feels bored with his job, and wants something different. But when Jack accidentally finds himself in Christmastown, his life regains meaning. Loving what he sees, Jack attempts to imitate the holiday, though things go terribly wrong. I have to say, The Nightmare Before Christmas was much different than I expected. While I assumed this would be a dark musical comedy, there's actually very little humor to be found. You might get a few smiles, and maybe a laugh, but The Nightmare Before Christmas is by no means a comedy. It's spellbinding fantasy, that imitates the classic Disney formula, while becoming a genre all of its own. The primary strength of this film, comes from the imagination and the visuals. The story line and setting is highly original. While only Halloweenland and Christmastown is ever seen, we are lead to believe that there's other Holiday themed world as well. It makes one wonder what could await in other lands... As far as the visuals go, this is certainly one of the best looking films I've ever seen. While never overly complex or as technically astounding as modern stopmotion films, The Nightmare Before Christmas boasts a visual style like nothing I've ever seen before. The character designs are brilliant. The landscapes are stunning. The visuals are much of what makes The Nightmare Before Christmas such a famed classic, and that's no surprise. Halloweenland and it's residents are wonderfully wicked, and often more creepy than actually scary. The slightly twisted nature to the setting here is memorable and enchanting. Christmastown recalls memories from How the Grinch Stole Christmas, while providing a much more cheery color palette. Unfortunately, Danny Elfman's songs are less than great. In general, they're forgettable and lacking in fun, and the rhyme schemes are often awkward and hard to follow. The lyrics often seem to force words to rhyme, making the songs slightly unpleasant to listen to at times. This is a shame, because there are so many songs in the film. Still, there are still several good ones, including "This is Halloween," "Kidnap the Sandy Claws," and the phenomenal "What's This?" The cast is nothing too special. Chris Sarandon voices Jack Skellington when talking, while composer and song writer Danny Elfman voices Jack when he's singing. Catherine O'Hara lends a forgettable voice for Sally, the love interest. Ken Page as Oogie Boogie is easily the standout, providing an energetic performance as the main antagonist. While Danny Elfman's songs in the film left something to be desired, his score is, quite possibly, some of his very best work. With some surprisingly jazzy segments (that sounds so much like Randy Newman's work, it's uncanny), and some great recurring musical themes and Christmas tie-ins, this is an excellent and hugely memorable score from Elfman. The main selling point may be the visuals, but that doesn't make this film worth seeing for it's other aspects. The story is very original, Elfman's score is great, and the whole production has imagination to spare. The Nightmare Before Christmas isn't as emotionally satisfying or as hilarious as the best of animated films, but the visuals alone makes this worth seeing.

    I'll start this review off by saying that, even though this was one of the first movies I ever saw, I was pretty darn terrified of it. I would often watch this film at my cousins' house growing up in the mid 90s early 2000s timeframe and when the monster from under the bed with his sharp teeth and red eyes made his first appearance, I cried in fright and called for mother. But growing older, and increasingly fond of the works of Tim Burton, I have come to be obsessed with this film and now it's one of my all time favorites. I like to think of this film as a mixture between the works of Edward Gory, the Rankin Bass Christmas stop motions such as Rudolph, and the many Charlie Chaplin movies you can think of. I mean, come on! You can't deny that Jack Skellington moves a lot like Charlie Chaplin. He has that diverse style that parallels that of Chaplin, and it obviously took several thousand shots to make him move. In my eyes, The Nightmare Before Christmas is Tim Burton's macabre imagination at it's finest, and really bridges the gap between beloved holiday classics and twisted, dark style Halloween thrillers. The stop motion animation, what can be said about it that hasn't already be said a gazillion and a half times already? Director Henry Selick and his crew really put sweat and blood into this animation and as a result, gave us animation that has a very German expressionist vibe to it, much like silent films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and 1925's The Phantom of the Opera. I just love how the characters move, Jack especially, and that they move in such a stylized, non human way. After all, these characters live in a fantasy world, so they should move in a stylized fashion rather than a realistic fashion. The design of the characters is also something to write home about. Every character has their own unique look and no two look the same. From the slinky, slender design of Jack Skellington, to the wide, twisted look of the Mayor, each character has their own characteristics and mannerisms and stick out from one another like soar thumbs. Even jolly old Saint Nick himself has his own thing going on, giving us a look of Santa Claus we had never seen before. What I also dig about the film is the overall design and atmosphere. From the curved gravestones of Halloweentown, to the real world's crooked dwellings, everything is non linear and gives the film a storybook quality, making you feel like you're within a dream or nightmare or someone else's subconscious. Even Christmastown has a touch of rugged scenery, right down to Santa's workshop. I also must praise the camera angles and perspectives represented throughout the film. Many scenes are shot in silhouette or in darkness and add a sense or tension, remorse or suspense to whatever scene is taking place at that moment. The scene where Jack walks up the hill, silhouetted against the massive yellow moon is in my opinion one of the crowning moments of Tim Burton's movie career and is the most iconic piece of imagery out of the entire film. It's very much like how ET and Elliot were silhouetted against the moon in the bike flying scene in ET or how the Batwing was silhouetted against the moon to create the bat signal in Burton's Batman. The music by Danny Elfman is by far one of his best works, blending in humor as well as dark, twisted choices of words. Danny Elfman must also be praised for doing Jack Skellington's singing voice, adding great depth to the character's point of view and inner torment. I also enjoyed Ken Page as Oogie Bogie, a character who was obviously inspired by Cab Calloway and his appearance in a 1932 Betty Boop cartoon. He portrays the Boogeyman as a sick, villainous tyrant who really enjoys inflicting pain on others. He also enjoys snacking on small insects when he himself is basically a huge pile of insects in a sack. The Nightmare Before Christmas displays a style not seen too often, and really showcases what can be done when hard work and dedication is put into stop motion animation. It also shows that Tim Burton has a pretty dark, yet child friendly imagination in his brain and isn't afraid to let it spew onto film. In my eyes, it's his second best masterpiece next to Edward Scissorhands.

    My wife and two kids, boys aged 9 and 12, settled down together to watch this and at the halfway point we all agreed to bail on it. Part of the problem is that much of the explication is given in song, so unless you're on top of interpreting screechy singing voices you will be a bit lost. And I didn't really care about any of the characters ... there was a girl who was important somehow but I had no idea of what her motivation was. Her creator was a pretty good evil guy, though. My kids thought it was creepy, so I guess the film had some power, but just not the kind of power that would make us want to watch it.

    Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), king of Halloweentown, discovers Christmas Town, but does not quite understand the concept. I understand this is a modern Christmas classic, and as we approach the 20th anniversary, there will probably be a great deal of fanfare. I guess I just do not get it, though. While I enjoy the movie, love the songs (Danny Elfman is amazing) and think the animation is spectacular, it is unclear to me how it has the strong cult following it does or how it has made the Top 250 movies list. Maybe I am just rebelling because I instinctively dislike things that are popular. But I just am not clear on the mass appeal. If we consider this a Tim Burton film (and that is debatable), it is probably among his best work... but still not on the level of, say, the Batman films or "Beetlejuice". And those do not get the level of praise. Why?

    We've seen quite a bit of stop-motion animation on television, with all of those holiday specials we see every Christmas, and of course, the infamous Wallace and Gromit shorts by filmmaker Nick Park in the U.K. However, in the 1990s, we haven't seen a whole lot of stop-motion animation on the big screen. In fact, we rarely saw that. However, one little film came to theatres in 1993 produced by "Batman" director Tim Burton and directed by then-newcomer Henry Selick (who would later make "Coraline") that really caught our attention. That film was "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas". The movie focuses around Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, who is tired of doing the same old celebration in Halloween Town year after year, as illustrated and interpreted in the film's second musical number. That's right. This is a musical. He wanders out of Halloween Town to find something new, until he stumbles upon a series of holiday doors in the middle of the forest. The one that catches his eye is a door in the shape of a tree. A Christmas tree as a matter of fact. He opens the door, only to be literally sucked in and discovers Christmas town. Fascinated by his discovery, he tells the citizens of Halloween Town all about it, and comes up with the idea of taking over Christmas this year. What happens after that I will not tell, because there are a certain number of people who have not even seen this fantastic movie yet. Let me make it clear, if the 10/10 score isn't clear enough already if you looked under the summary. I absolutely love this movie. A lot. In fact, it's within the top 10 of my all time favorite movies list (which I have not fully completed yet). Every year since I've gotten the Special Edition DVD at age 15, I've watched this movie numerous times every year, and it still has not gotten old. Even though I never got the opportunity to watch this movie at a younger age (for some reason -.-), waiting until I got my hands on the DVD disc paid off nicely. The structure of the sets and characters are absolutely brilliant and morbid for a stop-motion picture. A lot of care went into the making of this motion picture milestone, even if Tim Burton was absent most of the time. The reason for that was he was directing "Batman Returns" for Warner Brothers and he was also in pre-production for the R-rated drama "Ed Wood", which would also be released by Touchstone. So, because of this, it was director Henry Selick's job to make sure that Tim Burton's vision was alive and well during production. The result, a movie that defined the mind of Tim Burton as a whole. The music and songs, both done by former Oingo-Boingo front man and film composer Danny Elfman are also the highlight of the film besides the animation and visuals. There are 10 songs in total, and they are performed brilliantly. Danny Elfman also provides the singing voice of Jack Skellington. The music is celebrated to the point where in 2008, Walt Disney Records released a compilation album entitled "Nightmare Revisited", with all the songs and motion picture score performed by popular and independent acts, including the likes of Marilyn Manson, Korn, Rise Against, and the All-American Rejects (don't worry parents, it's family-friendly). Bizarre as it is, the compilation is definitely worth a buy if you love the film as much as I do. Today, 20 years later as of this review post, the film still holds up really well. Merchandise went up the wazoo, video games were made, and it even garnered a cult following. Whether you are watching it in 2D or 3D, chances are, you're gonna get the same reaction of amazement on how far we've gotten with filmmaking technology. Back then, animated films didn't solely rely on computer generated images to wow audiences. Craftsmanship and imagination were needed to make a film that can captivate the movie-going public. Granted, this doesn't always mark every single film a success, but in this case, it's what made it a classic. The film may have a few faults, which are really very small nitpicks, but it does not hurt the film one bit. This movie is still fun to watch, and it can be best viewed on Halloween and Christmas. That's right. It's not just a Christmas movie. It's a Halloween treat as well. If you haven't seen this film once in your life, you owe it to yourself to find a DVD/Blu-Ray copy of this movie. If you have kids, it's even better. Before I end this review, I must mention that Disney first released this film under their more adult subsidiary Touchstone Pictures, because they thought the movie would be too scary for younger audiences. In fact, it's what got it the PG rating. Ironically, this is the same studio that released a lesser known horror film called "The Watcher in the Woods". What they didn't realize is that kids eat this stuff up like Halloween candy. It wouldn't be until the 3D re-release when Disney themselves would distribute the film.

    Just about everyone considers this Burton's best film. First, he didn't direct this, he wrote and produced this. Second, it's really not that great. I still like it. There are great sights, funny bits, and memorable characters. The characters like Jack Skellington and Sally play off the dark quirkiness so well. However, there are still some complaints I have. The film should have been 15-20 minutes longer than it really is. I strongly feel more of the characters could've been better developed. Dr. Finkelstein was fun to watch but he needed more emotions besides angry. Santa Claus was surprisingly underused. And Oogie-Boogie, who is supposed to be the main antagonist, seemed to have come out nowhere with no build-up at all. It always bothers that he wasn't handled better. Also, except for "This is Halloween" and "What's This?", most of the songs were forgettable. Despite these flaws, I still recommend this for the holidays (or Halloween).

After all, these characters live in a fantasy world, so they should move in a stylized fashion rather than a realistic fashion. The design of the characters is also something to write home about. Every character has their own unique look and no two look the same. From the slinky, slender design of Jack Skellington, to the wide, twisted look of the Mayor, each character has their own characteristics and mannerisms and stick out from one another like soar thumbs. Even jolly old Saint Nick himself has his own thing going on, giving us a look of Santa Claus we had never seen before. What I also dig about the film is the overall design and atmosphere. From the curved gravestones of Halloweentown, to the real world's crooked dwellings, everything is non linear and gives the film a storybook quality, making you feel like you're within a dream or nightmare or someone else's subconscious. Even Christmastown has a touch of rugged scenery, right down to Santa's workshop. I also must praise the camera angles and perspectives represented throughout the film. Many scenes are shot in silhouette or in darkness and add a sense or tension, remorse or suspense to whatever scene is taking place at that moment. The scene where Jack walks up the hill, silhouetted against the massive yellow moon is in my opinion one of the crowning moments of Tim Burton's movie career and is the most iconic piece of imagery out of the entire film. It's very much like how ET and Elliot were silhouetted against the moon in the bike flying scene in ET or how the Batwing was silhouetted against the moon to create the bat signal in Burton's Batman. The music by Danny Elfman is by far one of his best works, blending in humor as well as dark, twisted choices of words. Danny Elfman must also be praised for doing Jack Skellington's singing voice, adding great depth to the character's point of view and inner torment. I also enjoyed Ken Page as Oogie Bogie, a character who was obviously inspired by Cab Calloway and his appearance in a 1932 Betty Boop cartoon. He portrays the Boogeyman as a sick, villainous tyrant who really enjoys inflicting pain on others. He also enjoys snacking on small insects when he himself is basically a huge pile of insects in a sack. The Nightmare Before Christmas displays a style not seen too often, and really showcases what can be done when hard work and dedication is put into stop motion animation. It also shows that Tim Burton has a pretty dark, yet child friendly imagination in his brain and isn't afraid to let it spew onto film. In my eyes, it's his second best masterpiece next to Edward Scissorhands.

    My wife and two kids, boys aged 9 and 12, settled down together to watch this and at the halfway point we all agreed to bail on it. Part of the problem is that much of the explication is given in song, so unless you're on top of interpreting screechy singing voices you will be a bit lost. And I didn't really care about any of the characters ... there was a girl who was important somehow but I had no idea of what her motivation was. Her creator was a pretty good evil guy, though. My kids thought it was creepy, so I guess the film had some power, but just not the kind of power that would make us want to watch it.

    Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), king of Halloweentown, discovers Christmas Town, but does not quite understand the concept. I understand this is a modern Christmas classic, and as we approach the 20th anniversary, there will probably be a great deal of fanfare. I guess I just do not get it, though. While I enjoy the movie, love the songs (Danny Elfman is amazing) and think the animation is spectacular, it is unclear to me how it has the strong cult following it does or how it has made the Top 250 movies list. Maybe I am just rebelling because I instinctively dislike things that are popular. But I just am not clear on the mass appeal. If we consider this a Tim Burton film (and that is debatable), it is probably among his best work... but still not on the level of, say, the Batman films or "Beetlejuice". And those do not get the level of praise. Why?

    We've seen quite a bit of stop-motion animation on television, with all of those holiday specials we see every Christmas, and of course, the infamous Wallace and Gromit shorts by filmmaker Nick Park in the U.K. However, in the 1990s, we haven't seen a whole lot of stop-motion animation on the big screen. In fact, we rarely saw that. However, one little film came to theatres in 1993 produced by "Batman" director Tim Burton and directed by then-newcomer Henry Selick (who would later make "Coraline") that really caught our attention. That film was "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas". The movie focuses around Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, who is tired of doing the same old celebration in Halloween Town year after year, as illustrated and interpreted in the film's second musical number. That's right. This is a musical. He wanders out of Halloween Town to find something new, until he stumbles upon a series of holiday doors in the middle of the forest. The one that catches his eye is a door in the shape of a tree. A Christmas tree as a matter of fact. He opens the door, only to be literally sucked in and discovers Christmas town. Fascinated by his discovery, he tells the citizens of Halloween Town all about it, and comes up with the idea of taking over Christmas this year. What happens after that I will not tell, because there are a certain number of people who have not even seen this fantastic movie yet. Let me make it clear, if the 10/10 score isn't clear enough already if you looked under the summary. I absolutely love this movie. A lot. In fact, it's within the top 10 of my all time favorite movies list (which I have not fully completed yet). Every year since I've gotten the Special Edition DVD at age 15, I've watched this movie numerous times every year, and it still has not gotten old. Even though I never got the opportunity to watch this movie at a younger age (for some reason -.-), waiting until I got my hands on the DVD disc paid off nicely. The structure of the sets and characters are absolutely brilliant and morbid for a stop-motion picture. A lot of care went into the making of this motion picture milestone, even if Tim Burton was absent most of the time. The reason for that was he was directing "Batman Returns" for Warner Brothers and he was also in pre-production for the R-rated drama "Ed Wood", which would also be released by Touchstone. So, because of this, it was director Henry Selick's job to make sure that Tim Burton's vision was alive and well during production. The result, a movie that defined the mind of Tim Burton as a whole. The music and songs, both done by former Oingo-Boingo front man and film composer Danny Elfman are also the highlight of the film besides the animation and visuals. There are 10 songs in total, and they are performed brilliantly. Danny Elfman also provides the singing voice of Jack Skellington. The music is celebrated to the point where in 2008, Walt Disney Records released a compilation album entitled "Nightmare Revisited", with all the songs and motion picture score performed by popular and independent acts, including the likes of Marilyn Manson, Korn, Rise Against, and the All-American Rejects (don't worry parents, it's family-friendly). Bizarre as it is, the compilation is definitely worth a buy if you love the film as much as I do. Today, 20 years later as of this review post, the film still holds up really well. Merchandise went up the wazoo, video games were made, and it even garnered a cult following. Whether you are watching it in 2D or 3D, chances are, you're gonna get the same reaction of amazement on how far we've gotten with filmmaking technology. Back then, animated films didn't solely rely on computer generated images to wow audiences. Craftsmanship and imagination were needed to make a film that can captivate the movie-going public. Granted, this doesn't always mark every single film a success, but in this case, it's what made it a classic. The film may have a few faults, which are really very small nitpicks, but it does not hurt the film one bit. This movie is still fun to watch, and it can be best viewed on Halloween and Christmas. That's right. It's not just a Christmas movie. It's a Halloween treat as well. If you haven't seen this film once in your life, you owe it to yourself to find a DVD/Blu-Ray copy of this movie. If you have kids, it's even better. Before I end this review, I must mention that Disney first released this film under their more adult subsidiary Touchstone Pictures, because they thought the movie would be too scary for younger audiences. In fact, it's what got it the PG rating. Ironically, this is the same studio that released a lesser known horror film called "The Watcher in the Woods". What they didn't realize is that kids eat this stuff up like Halloween candy. It wouldn't be until the 3D re-release when Disney themselves would distribute the film.

    Just about everyone considers this Burton's best film. First, he didn't direct this, he wrote and produced this. Second, it's really not that great. I still like it. There are great sights, funny bits, and memorable characters. The characters like Jack Skellington and Sally play off the dark quirkiness so well. However, there are still some complaints I have. The film should have been 15-20 minutes longer than it really is. I strongly feel more of the characters could've been better developed. Dr. Finkelstein was fun to watch but he needed more emotions besides angry. Santa Claus was surprisingly underused. And Oogie-Boogie, who is supposed to be the main antagonist, seemed to have come out nowhere with no build-up at all. It always bothers that he wasn't handled better. Also, except for "This is Halloween" and "What's This?", most of the songs were forgettable. Despite these flaws, I still recommend this for the holidays (or Halloween).

    A beautifully creepy brief movie, were we get a first glimpse of Henry Selick, odd and fascinating thoughts. Tim Burton is as well known for his most unusual ideas, the character and picture we get to familiar ourselves with in this movie is unquestionably deviant. The animation was somewhat new to me, odd, pointy, squeaky eyes, long, short, scary, unlike anything else i could imagine, but i cherished every second of it. I'm not certain what kind of audience they were aiming towards, i can only imagine a child would be frightened by this kind of animation and atmosphere. This movie has to rely a lot on the music involved, so choosing the right composer who is experienced in the spooky/Goth themes is important, Danny Elfman has worked with this before and showed that he is competent enough, and was the perfect choice. Jack, our main character, lives in a Gothic world with monsters and nightmares, were death is around the corner. He stumbles upon this colorful world, which opposite to what he's used to (which is dull colors) this world consists of cheerful, living people and a colorful environment. Jack is a unhappy, dead, creature which feels emptiness and is searching for something unknown, jack, despite being a monster, he only wants to contribute and do good deeds, but doesn't realize they aren't so good after all. One can speculate if there is a moral of this story, i believe that its about not trying to change yourself, and accept yourself for who you are.

    This long animation from Tim Burton is already considered a cult classic and surely a reference from this director. It's visually stunning and it creates characters and "worlds" that can only truly exist in Tim Burton's mindÂ… and it is, in my perspective, its most valuable feature. The plot is very simple and straight to follow but in fact it's what matters the less! The scenarios, the colors, the strange characters, the black humor and its final message are what really matter in this long animation! I think it's a good movie in its particular genreÂ… Just to make notice I watched the 3D version. I score it 7/10.

    I don't know a single person who doesn't love this movie. Tim Burton nailed this one in my eyes, and this is the movie that introduced my generation to him and to claymation as well. I was very young when this movie came out, and yes it scared me but it was the greatest movie ever. This the go-to movie when it's time for Halloween, and Christmas as well, to get you in the spirit! The soundtrack is gold and every song is fantastic and you know most of the words from the first time you see it. It has been almost 20 years since it came out and it still has a cult following, a mega franchise and screaming fans of all ages. Disney was right to pick up the rights for this movie because I guarantee you it has done nothing but given them more money for years to come. It may scare very small children but they will either get over it or come to love it in a couple of years.

    This movie is an all around masterpiece. Burton expresses his wild and beautiful imagination in this vivid and expertly crafted stop motion musical based off of an original poem he wrote. It has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remember, and it's very easy to watch over and over again. It's a wonderful and heartfelt story of discovering one's destiny, and fulfilling dreams. The single most amazing film I have ever seen. I recommend this film to anyone who easily accepts artistic viewing material, and is up for the dark implications of the setting and characters. A fantastic film that is good for any circumstances, whether the viewers be having a date night, sleepover, family movie night, party, or any other setting.

    The Nightmare Before Christmas represents what one might argue to be the most famous and well known stopmotion film of all time. It's one of the few films that generally receive annual viewings, and it's often raved as Tim Burton's best film (despite actually being directed by Henry Selick). Even if this is a case of style over substance, I couldn't help but be enchanted by this visually stunning picture, and I feel this is truly worthy of its cult classic status. Jack Skellington, the hailed leader of Halloweenland wraps up yet another successful Halloween. The entire land loves him, and though Jack receives much adoration, he feels bored with his job, and wants something different. But when Jack accidentally finds himself in Christmastown, his life regains meaning. Loving what he sees, Jack attempts to imitate the holiday, though things go terribly wrong. I have to say, The Nightmare Before Christmas was much different than I expected. While I assumed this would be a dark musical comedy, there's actually very little humor to be found. You might get a few smiles, and maybe a laugh, but The Nightmare Before Christmas is by no means a comedy. It's spellbinding fantasy, that imitates the classic Disney formula, while becoming a genre all of its own. The primary strength of this film, comes from the imagination and the visuals. The story line and setting is highly original. While only Halloweenland and Christmastown is ever seen, we are lead to believe that there's other Holiday themed world as well. It makes one wonder what could await in other lands... As far as the visuals go, this is certainly one of the best looking films I've ever seen. While never overly complex or as technically astounding as modern stopmotion films, The Nightmare Before Christmas boasts a visual style like nothing I've ever seen before. The character designs are brilliant. The landscapes are stunning. The visuals are much of what makes The Nightmare Before Christmas such a famed classic, and that's no surprise. Halloweenland and it's residents are wonderfully wicked, and often more creepy than actually scary. The slightly twisted nature to the setting here is memorable and enchanting. Christmastown recalls memories from How the Grinch Stole Christmas, while providing a much more cheery color palette. Unfortunately, Danny Elfman's songs are less than great. In general, they're forgettable and lacking in fun, and the rhyme schemes are often awkward and hard to follow. The lyrics often seem to force words to rhyme, making the songs slightly unpleasant to listen to at times. This is a shame, because there are so many songs in the film. Still, there are still several good ones, including "This is Halloween," "Kidnap the Sandy Claws," and the phenomenal "What's This?" The cast is nothing too special. Chris Sarandon voices Jack Skellington when talking, while composer and song writer Danny Elfman voices Jack when he's singing. Catherine O'Hara lends a forgettable voice for Sally, the love interest. Ken Page as Oogie Boogie is easily the standout, providing an energetic performance as the main antagonist. While Danny Elfman's songs in the film left something to be desired, his score is, quite possibly, some of his very best work. With some surprisingly jazzy segments (that sounds so much like Randy Newman's work, it's uncanny), and some great recurring musical themes and Christmas tie-ins, this is an excellent and hugely memorable score from Elfman. The main selling point may be the visuals, but that doesn't make this film worth seeing for it's other aspects. The story is very original, Elfman's score is great, and the whole production has imagination to spare. The Nightmare Before Christmas isn't as emotionally satisfying or as hilarious as the best of animated films, but the visuals alone makes this worth seeing.

    I'll start this review off by saying that, even though this was one of the first movies I ever saw, I was pretty darn terrified of it. I would often watch this film at my cousins' house growing up in the mid 90s early 2000s timeframe and when the monster from under the bed with his sharp teeth and red eyes made his first appearance, I cried in fright and called for mother. But growing older, and increasingly fond of the works of Tim Burton, I have come to be obsessed with this film and now it's one of my all time favorites. I like to think of this film as a mixture between the works of Edward Gory, the Rankin Bass Christmas stop motions such as Rudolph, and the many Charlie Chaplin movies you can think of. I mean, come on! You can't deny that Jack Skellington moves a lot like Charlie Chaplin. He has that diverse style that parallels that of Chaplin, and it obviously took several thousand shots to make him move. In my eyes, The Nightmare Before Christmas is Tim Burton's macabre imagination at it's finest, and really bridges the gap between beloved holiday classics and twisted, dark style Halloween thrillers. The stop motion animation, what can be said about it that hasn't already be said a gazillion and a half times already? Director Henry Selick and his crew really put sweat and blood into this animation and as a result, gave us animation that has a very German expressionist vibe to it, much like silent films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and 1925's The Phantom of the Opera. I just love how the characters move, Jack especially, and that they move in such a stylized, non human way.

Even Christmastown has a touch of rugged scenery, right down to Santa's workshop. I also must praise the camera angles and perspectives represented throughout the film. Many scenes are shot in silhouette or in darkness and add a sense or tension, remorse or suspense to whatever scene is taking place at that moment. The scene where Jack walks up the hill, silhouetted against the massive yellow moon is in my opinion one of the crowning moments of Tim Burton's movie career and is the most iconic piece of imagery out of the entire film. It's very much like how ET and Elliot were silhouetted against the moon in the bike flying scene in ET or how the Batwing was silhouetted against the moon to create the bat signal in Burton's Batman.

Danny Elfman must also be praised for doing Jack Skellington's singing voice, adding great depth to the character's point of view and inner torment. I also enjoyed Ken Page as Oogie Bogie, a character who was obviously inspired by Cab Calloway and his appearance in a 1932 Betty Boop cartoon. He portrays the Boogeyman as a sick, villainous tyrant who really enjoys inflicting pain on others. He also enjoys snacking on small insects when he himself is basically a huge pile of insects in a sack.

    Just about everyone considers this Burton's best film. First, he didn't direct this, he wrote and produced this. Second, it's really not that great. I still like it. There are great sights, funny bits, and memorable characters. The characters like Jack Skellington and Sally play off the dark quirkiness so well. However, there are still some complaints I have. The film should have been 15-20 minutes longer than it really is. I strongly feel more of the characters could've been better developed. Dr. Finkelstein was fun to watch but he needed more emotions besides angry. Santa Claus was surprisingly underused. And Oogie-Boogie, who is supposed to be the main antagonist, seemed to have come out nowhere with no build-up at all. It always bothers that he wasn't handled better. Also, except for "This is Halloween" and "What's This?", most of the songs were forgettable. Despite these flaws, I still recommend this for the holidays (or Halloween).

    A beautifully creepy brief movie, were we get a first glimpse of Henry Selick, odd and fascinating thoughts. Tim Burton is as well known for his most unusual ideas, the character and picture we get to familiar ourselves with in this movie is unquestionably deviant. The animation was somewhat new to me, odd, pointy, squeaky eyes, long, short, scary, unlike anything else i could imagine, but i cherished every second of it. I'm not certain what kind of audience they were aiming towards, i can only imagine a child would be frightened by this kind of animation and atmosphere. This movie has to rely a lot on the music involved, so choosing the right composer who is experienced in the spooky/Goth themes is important, Danny Elfman has worked with this before and showed that he is competent enough, and was the perfect choice. Jack, our main character, lives in a Gothic world with monsters and nightmares, were death is around the corner. He stumbles upon this colorful world, which opposite to what he's used to (which is dull colors) this world consists of cheerful, living people and a colorful environment. Jack is a unhappy, dead, creature which feels emptiness and is searching for something unknown, jack, despite being a monster, he only wants to contribute and do good deeds, but doesn't realize they aren't so good after all. One can speculate if there is a moral of this story, i believe that its about not trying to change yourself, and accept yourself for who you are.

    This long animation from Tim Burton is already considered a cult classic and surely a reference from this director. It's visually stunning and it creates characters and "worlds" that can only truly exist in Tim Burton's mindÂ… and it is, in my perspective, its most valuable feature. The plot is very simple and straight to follow but in fact it's what matters the less! The scenarios, the colors, the strange characters, the black humor and its final message are what really matter in this long animation! I think it's a good movie in its particular genreÂ… Just to make notice I watched the 3D version. I score it 7/10.

    I don't know a single person who doesn't love this movie. Tim Burton nailed this one in my eyes, and this is the movie that introduced my generation to him and to claymation as well. I was very young when this movie came out, and yes it scared me but it was the greatest movie ever. This the go-to movie when it's time for Halloween, and Christmas as well, to get you in the spirit! The soundtrack is gold and every song is fantastic and you know most of the words from the first time you see it. It has been almost 20 years since it came out and it still has a cult following, a mega franchise and screaming fans of all ages. Disney was right to pick up the rights for this movie because I guarantee you it has done nothing but given them more money for years to come. It may scare very small children but they will either get over it or come to love it in a couple of years.

    This movie is an all around masterpiece. Burton expresses his wild and beautiful imagination in this vivid and expertly crafted stop motion musical based off of an original poem he wrote. It has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remember, and it's very easy to watch over and over again. It's a wonderful and heartfelt story of discovering one's destiny, and fulfilling dreams. The single most amazing film I have ever seen. I recommend this film to anyone who easily accepts artistic viewing material, and is up for the dark implications of the setting and characters. A fantastic film that is good for any circumstances, whether the viewers be having a date night, sleepover, family movie night, party, or any other setting.

    The Nightmare Before Christmas represents what one might argue to be the most famous and well known stopmotion film of all time. It's one of the few films that generally receive annual viewings, and it's often raved as Tim Burton's best film (despite actually being directed by Henry Selick). Even if this is a case of style over substance, I couldn't help but be enchanted by this visually stunning picture, and I feel this is truly worthy of its cult classic status. Jack Skellington, the hailed leader of Halloweenland wraps up yet another successful Halloween. The entire land loves him, and though Jack receives much adoration, he feels bored with his job, and wants something different. But when Jack accidentally finds himself in Christmastown, his life regains meaning. Loving what he sees, Jack attempts to imitate the holiday, though things go terribly wrong. I have to say, The Nightmare Before Christmas was much different than I expected. While I assumed this would be a dark musical comedy, there's actually very little humor to be found. You might get a few smiles, and maybe a laugh, but The Nightmare Before Christmas is by no means a comedy. It's spellbinding fantasy, that imitates the classic Disney formula, while becoming a genre all of its own. The primary strength of this film, comes from the imagination and the visuals. The story line and setting is highly original. While only Halloweenland and Christmastown is ever seen, we are lead to believe that there's other Holiday themed world as well. It makes one wonder what could await in other lands... As far as the visuals go, this is certainly one of the best looking films I've ever seen. While never overly complex or as technically astounding as modern stopmotion films, The Nightmare Before Christmas boasts a visual style like nothing I've ever seen before. The character designs are brilliant. The landscapes are stunning. The visuals are much of what makes The Nightmare Before Christmas such a famed classic, and that's no surprise. Halloweenland and it's residents are wonderfully wicked, and often more creepy than actually scary. The slightly twisted nature to the setting here is memorable and enchanting. Christmastown recalls memories from How the Grinch Stole Christmas, while providing a much more cheery color palette. Unfortunately, Danny Elfman's songs are less than great. In general, they're forgettable and lacking in fun, and the rhyme schemes are often awkward and hard to follow. The lyrics often seem to force words to rhyme, making the songs slightly unpleasant to listen to at times. This is a shame, because there are so many songs in the film. Still, there are still several good ones, including "This is Halloween," "Kidnap the Sandy Claws," and the phenomenal "What's This?" The cast is nothing too special. Chris Sarandon voices Jack Skellington when talking, while composer and song writer Danny Elfman voices Jack when he's singing. Catherine O'Hara lends a forgettable voice for Sally, the love interest. Ken Page as Oogie Boogie is easily the standout, providing an energetic performance as the main antagonist. While Danny Elfman's songs in the film left something to be desired, his score is, quite possibly, some of his very best work. With some surprisingly jazzy segments (that sounds so much like Randy Newman's work, it's uncanny), and some great recurring musical themes and Christmas tie-ins, this is an excellent and hugely memorable score from Elfman. The main selling point may be the visuals, but that doesn't make this film worth seeing for it's other aspects. The story is very original, Elfman's score is great, and the whole production has imagination to spare. The Nightmare Before Christmas isn't as emotionally satisfying or as hilarious as the best of animated films, but the visuals alone makes this worth seeing.

    I'll start this review off by saying that, even though this was one of the first movies I ever saw, I was pretty darn terrified of it. I would often watch this film at my cousins' house growing up in the mid 90s early 2000s timeframe and when the monster from under the bed with his sharp teeth and red eyes made his first appearance, I cried in fright and called for mother. But growing older, and increasingly fond of the works of Tim Burton, I have come to be obsessed with this film and now it's one of my all time favorites. I like to think of this film as a mixture between the works of Edward Gory, the Rankin Bass Christmas stop motions such as Rudolph, and the many Charlie Chaplin movies you can think of. I mean, come on! You can't deny that Jack Skellington moves a lot like Charlie Chaplin. He has that diverse style that parallels that of Chaplin, and it obviously took several thousand shots to make him move. In my eyes, The Nightmare Before Christmas is Tim Burton's macabre imagination at it's finest, and really bridges the gap between beloved holiday classics and twisted, dark style Halloween thrillers. The stop motion animation, what can be said about it that hasn't already be said a gazillion and a half times already? Director Henry Selick and his crew really put sweat and blood into this animation and as a result, gave us animation that has a very German expressionist vibe to it, much like silent films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and 1925's The Phantom of the Opera. I just love how the characters move, Jack especially, and that they move in such a stylized, non human way. After all, these characters live in a fantasy world, so they should move in a stylized fashion rather than a realistic fashion. The design of the characters is also something to write home about. Every character has their own unique look and no two look the same. From the slinky, slender design of Jack Skellington, to the wide, twisted look of the Mayor, each character has their own characteristics and mannerisms and stick out from one another like soar thumbs. Even jolly old Saint Nick himself has his own thing going on, giving us a look of Santa Claus we had never seen before. What I also dig about the film is the overall design and atmosphere. From the curved gravestones of Halloweentown, to the real world's crooked dwellings, everything is non linear and gives the film a storybook quality, making you feel like you're within a dream or nightmare or someone else's subconscious. Even Christmastown has a touch of rugged scenery, right down to Santa's workshop. I also must praise the camera angles and perspectives represented throughout the film. Many scenes are shot in silhouette or in darkness and add a sense or tension, remorse or suspense to whatever scene is taking place at that moment. The scene where Jack walks up the hill, silhouetted against the massive yellow moon is in my opinion one of the crowning moments of Tim Burton's movie career and is the most iconic piece of imagery out of the entire film. It's very much like how ET and Elliot were silhouetted against the moon in the bike flying scene in ET or how the Batwing was silhouetted against the moon to create the bat signal in Burton's Batman. The music by Danny Elfman is by far one of his best works, blending in humor as well as dark, twisted choices of words. Danny Elfman must also be praised for doing Jack Skellington's singing voice, adding great depth to the character's point of view and inner torment. I also enjoyed Ken Page as Oogie Bogie, a character who was obviously inspired by Cab Calloway and his appearance in a 1932 Betty Boop cartoon. He portrays the Boogeyman as a sick, villainous tyrant who really enjoys inflicting pain on others. He also enjoys snacking on small insects when he himself is basically a huge pile of insects in a sack. The Nightmare Before Christmas displays a style not seen too often, and really showcases what can be done when hard work and dedication is put into stop motion animation. It also shows that Tim Burton has a pretty dark, yet child friendly imagination in his brain and isn't afraid to let it spew onto film. In my eyes, it's his second best masterpiece next to Edward Scissorhands.

    My wife and two kids, boys aged 9 and 12, settled down together to watch this and at the halfway point we all agreed to bail on it. Part of the problem is that much of the explication is given in song, so unless you're on top of interpreting screechy singing voices you will be a bit lost. And I didn't really care about any of the characters ... there was a girl who was important somehow but I had no idea of what her motivation was. Her creator was a pretty good evil guy, though. My kids thought it was creepy, so I guess the film had some power, but just not the kind of power that would make us want to watch it.

    Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), king of Halloweentown, discovers Christmas Town, but does not quite understand the concept. I understand this is a modern Christmas classic, and as we approach the 20th anniversary, there will probably be a great deal of fanfare. I guess I just do not get it, though. While I enjoy the movie, love the songs (Danny Elfman is amazing) and think the animation is spectacular, it is unclear to me how it has the strong cult following it does or how it has made the Top 250 movies list. Maybe I am just rebelling because I instinctively dislike things that are popular. But I just am not clear on the mass appeal. If we consider this a Tim Burton film (and that is debatable), it is probably among his best work... but still not on the level of, say, the Batman films or "Beetlejuice". And those do not get the level of praise. Why?

    We've seen quite a bit of stop-motion animation on television, with all of those holiday specials we see every Christmas, and of course, the infamous Wallace and Gromit shorts by filmmaker Nick Park in the U.K. However, in the 1990s, we haven't seen a whole lot of stop-motion animation on the big screen. In fact, we rarely saw that. However, one little film came to theatres in 1993 produced by "Batman" director Tim Burton and directed by then-newcomer Henry Selick (who would later make "Coraline") that really caught our attention. That film was "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas". The movie focuses around Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, who is tired of doing the same old celebration in Halloween Town year after year, as illustrated and interpreted in the film's second musical number. That's right. This is a musical. He wanders out of Halloween Town to find something new, until he stumbles upon a series of holiday doors in the middle of the forest. The one that catches his eye is a door in the shape of a tree. A Christmas tree as a matter of fact. He opens the door, only to be literally sucked in and discovers Christmas town. Fascinated by his discovery, he tells the citizens of Halloween Town all about it, and comes up with the idea of taking over Christmas this year. What happens after that I will not tell, because there are a certain number of people who have not even seen this fantastic movie yet. Let me make it clear, if the 10/10 score isn't clear enough already if you looked under the summary. I absolutely love this movie. A lot. In fact, it's within the top 10 of my all time favorite movies list (which I have not fully completed yet). Every year since I've gotten the Special Edition DVD at age 15, I've watched this movie numerous times every year, and it still has not gotten old. Even though I never got the opportunity to watch this movie at a younger age (for some reason -.-), waiting until I got my hands on the DVD disc paid off nicely. The structure of the sets and characters are absolutely brilliant and morbid for a stop-motion picture. A lot of care went into the making of this motion picture milestone, even if Tim Burton was absent most of the time. The reason for that was he was directing "Batman Returns" for Warner Brothers and he was also in pre-production for the R-rated drama "Ed Wood", which would also be released by Touchstone. So, because of this, it was director Henry Selick's job to make sure that Tim Burton's vision was alive and well during production. The result, a movie that defined the mind of Tim Burton as a whole. The music and songs, both done by former Oingo-Boingo front man and film composer Danny Elfman are also the highlight of the film besides the animation and visuals. There are 10 songs in total, and they are performed brilliantly. Danny Elfman also provides the singing voice of Jack Skellington. The music is celebrated to the point where in 2008, Walt Disney Records released a compilation album entitled "Nightmare Revisited", with all the songs and motion picture score performed by popular and independent acts, including the likes of Marilyn Manson, Korn, Rise Against, and the All-American Rejects (don't worry parents, it's family-friendly). Bizarre as it is, the compilation is definitely worth a buy if you love the film as much as I do. Today, 20 years later as of this review post, the film still holds up really well. Merchandise went up the wazoo, video games were made, and it even garnered a cult following. Whether you are watching it in 2D or 3D, chances are, you're gonna get the same reaction of amazement on how far we've gotten with filmmaking technology. Back then, animated films didn't solely rely on computer generated images to wow audiences. Craftsmanship and imagination were needed to make a film that can captivate the movie-going public. Granted, this doesn't always mark every single film a success, but in this case, it's what made it a classic. The film may have a few faults, which are really very small nitpicks, but it does not hurt the film one bit. This movie is still fun to watch, and it can be best viewed on Halloween and Christmas. That's right. It's not just a Christmas movie. It's a Halloween treat as well. If you haven't seen this film once in your life, you owe it to yourself to find a DVD/Blu-Ray copy of this movie. If you have kids, it's even better. Before I end this review, I must mention that Disney first released this film under their more adult subsidiary Touchstone Pictures, because they thought the movie would be too scary for younger audiences. In fact, it's what got it the PG rating. Ironically, this is the same studio that released a lesser known horror film called "The Watcher in the Woods". What they didn't realize is that kids eat this stuff up like Halloween candy. It wouldn't be until the 3D re-release when Disney themselves would distribute the film.

I would often watch this film at my cousins' house growing up in the mid 90s early 2000s timeframe and when the monster from under the bed with his sharp teeth and red eyes made his first appearance, I cried in fright and called for mother. But growing older, and increasingly fond of the works of Tim Burton, I have come to be obsessed with this film and now it's one of my all time favorites. I like to think of this film as a mixture between the works of Edward Gory, the Rankin Bass Christmas stop motions such as Rudolph, and the many Charlie Chaplin movies you can think of. I mean, come on! You can't deny that Jack Skellington moves a lot like Charlie Chaplin. He has that diverse style that parallels that of Chaplin, and it obviously took several thousand shots to make him move. In my eyes, The Nightmare Before Christmas is Tim Burton's macabre imagination at it's finest, and really bridges the gap between beloved holiday classics and twisted, dark style Halloween thrillers. The stop motion animation, what can be said about it that hasn't already be said a gazillion and a half times already? Director Henry Selick and his crew really put sweat and blood into this animation and as a result, gave us animation that has a very German expressionist vibe to it, much like silent films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and 1925's The Phantom of the Opera. I just love how the characters move, Jack especially, and that they move in such a stylized, non human way. After all, these characters live in a fantasy world, so they should move in a stylized fashion rather than a realistic fashion. The design of the characters is also something to write home about. Every character has their own unique look and no two look the same. From the slinky, slender design of Jack Skellington, to the wide, twisted look of the Mayor, each character has their own characteristics and mannerisms and stick out from one another like soar thumbs. Even jolly old Saint Nick himself has his own thing going on, giving us a look of Santa Claus we had never seen before. What I also dig about the film is the overall design and atmosphere. From the curved gravestones of Halloweentown, to the real world's crooked dwellings, everything is non linear and gives the film a storybook quality, making you feel like you're within a dream or nightmare or someone else's subconscious. Even Christmastown has a touch of rugged scenery, right down to Santa's workshop. I also must praise the camera angles and perspectives represented throughout the film. Many scenes are shot in silhouette or in darkness and add a sense or tension, remorse or suspense to whatever scene is taking place at that moment. The scene where Jack walks up the hill, silhouetted against the massive yellow moon is in my opinion one of the crowning moments of Tim Burton's movie career and is the most iconic piece of imagery out of the entire film. It's very much like how ET and Elliot were silhouetted against the moon in the bike flying scene in ET or how the Batwing was silhouetted against the moon to create the bat signal in Burton's Batman. The music by Danny Elfman is by far one of his best works, blending in humor as well as dark, twisted choices of words. Danny Elfman must also be praised for doing Jack Skellington's singing voice, adding great depth to the character's point of view and inner torment. I also enjoyed Ken Page as Oogie Bogie, a character who was obviously inspired by Cab Calloway and his appearance in a 1932 Betty Boop cartoon. He portrays the Boogeyman as a sick, villainous tyrant who really enjoys inflicting pain on others. He also enjoys snacking on small insects when he himself is basically a huge pile of insects in a sack. The Nightmare Before Christmas displays a style not seen too often, and really showcases what can be done when hard work and dedication is put into stop motion animation. It also shows that Tim Burton has a pretty dark, yet child friendly imagination in his brain and isn't afraid to let it spew onto film. In my eyes, it's his second best masterpiece next to Edward Scissorhands.

    My wife and two kids, boys aged 9 and 12, settled down together to watch this and at the halfway point we all agreed to bail on it. Part of the problem is that much of the explication is given in song, so unless you're on top of interpreting screechy singing voices you will be a bit lost. And I didn't really care about any of the characters ... there was a girl who was important somehow but I had no idea of what her motivation was. Her creator was a pretty good evil guy, though. My kids thought it was creepy, so I guess the film had some power, but just not the kind of power that would make us want to watch it.

    Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), king of Halloweentown, discovers Christmas Town, but does not quite understand the concept. I understand this is a modern Christmas classic, and as we approach the 20th anniversary, there will probably be a great deal of fanfare. I guess I just do not get it, though. While I enjoy the movie, love the songs (Danny Elfman is amazing) and think the animation is spectacular, it is unclear to me how it has the strong cult following it does or how it has made the Top 250 movies list. Maybe I am just rebelling because I instinctively dislike things that are popular. But I just am not clear on the mass appeal. If we consider this a Tim Burton film (and that is debatable), it is probably among his best work... but still not on the level of, say, the Batman films or "Beetlejuice". And those do not get the level of praise. Why?

    We've seen quite a bit of stop-motion animation on television, with all of those holiday specials we see every Christmas, and of course, the infamous Wallace and Gromit shorts by filmmaker Nick Park in the U.K. However, in the 1990s, we haven't seen a whole lot of stop-motion animation on the big screen. In fact, we rarely saw that. However, one little film came to theatres in 1993 produced by "Batman" director Tim Burton and directed by then-newcomer Henry Selick (who would later make "Coraline") that really caught our attention. That film was "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas". The movie focuses around Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, who is tired of doing the same old celebration in Halloween Town year after year, as illustrated and interpreted in the film's second musical number. That's right. This is a musical. He wanders out of Halloween Town to find something new, until he stumbles upon a series of holiday doors in the middle of the forest. The one that catches his eye is a door in the shape of a tree. A Christmas tree as a matter of fact. He opens the door, only to be literally sucked in and discovers Christmas town. Fascinated by his discovery, he tells the citizens of Halloween Town all about it, and comes up with the idea of taking over Christmas this year. What happens after that I will not tell, because there are a certain number of people who have not even seen this fantastic movie yet. Let me make it clear, if the 10/10 score isn't clear enough already if you looked under the summary. I absolutely love this movie. A lot. In fact, it's within the top 10 of my all time favorite movies list (which I have not fully completed yet). Every year since I've gotten the Special Edition DVD at age 15, I've watched this movie numerous times every year, and it still has not gotten old. Even though I never got the opportunity to watch this movie at a younger age (for some reason -.-), waiting until I got my hands on the DVD disc paid off nicely. The structure of the sets and characters are absolutely brilliant and morbid for a stop-motion picture. A lot of care went into the making of this motion picture milestone, even if Tim Burton was absent most of the time. The reason for that was he was directing "Batman Returns" for Warner Brothers and he was also in pre-production for the R-rated drama "Ed Wood", which would also be released by Touchstone. So, because of this, it was director Henry Selick's job to make sure that Tim Burton's vision was alive and well during production. The result, a movie that defined the mind of Tim Burton as a whole. The music and songs, both done by former Oingo-Boingo front man and film composer Danny Elfman are also the highlight of the film besides the animation and visuals. There are 10 songs in total, and they are performed brilliantly. Danny Elfman also provides the singing voice of Jack Skellington. The music is celebrated to the point where in 2008, Walt Disney Records released a compilation album entitled "Nightmare Revisited", with all the songs and motion picture score performed by popular and independent acts, including the likes of Marilyn Manson, Korn, Rise Against, and the All-American Rejects (don't worry parents, it's family-friendly). Bizarre as it is, the compilation is definitely worth a buy if you love the film as much as I do. Today, 20 years later as of this review post, the film still holds up really well. Merchandise went up the wazoo, video games were made, and it even garnered a cult following. Whether you are watching it in 2D or 3D, chances are, you're gonna get the same reaction of amazement on how far we've gotten with filmmaking technology. Back then, animated films didn't solely rely on computer generated images to wow audiences. Craftsmanship and imagination were needed to make a film that can captivate the movie-going public. Granted, this doesn't always mark every single film a success, but in this case, it's what made it a classic. The film may have a few faults, which are really very small nitpicks, but it does not hurt the film one bit. This movie is still fun to watch, and it can be best viewed on Halloween and Christmas. That's right. It's not just a Christmas movie. It's a Halloween treat as well. If you haven't seen this film once in your life, you owe it to yourself to find a DVD/Blu-Ray copy of this movie. If you have kids, it's even better. Before I end this review, I must mention that Disney first released this film under their more adult subsidiary Touchstone Pictures, because they thought the movie would be too scary for younger audiences. In fact, it's what got it the PG rating. Ironically, this is the same studio that released a lesser known horror film called "The Watcher in the Woods". What they didn't realize is that kids eat this stuff up like Halloween candy. It wouldn't be until the 3D re-release when Disney themselves would distribute the film.

    Just about everyone considers this Burton's best film. First, he didn't direct this, he wrote and produced this. Second, it's really not that great. I still like it. There are great sights, funny bits, and memorable characters. The characters like Jack Skellington and Sally play off the dark quirkiness so well. However, there are still some complaints I have. The film should have been 15-20 minutes longer than it really is. I strongly feel more of the characters could've been better developed. Dr. Finkelstein was fun to watch but he needed more emotions besides angry. Santa Claus was surprisingly underused. And Oogie-Boogie, who is supposed to be the main antagonist, seemed to have come out nowhere with no build-up at all. It always bothers that he wasn't handled better. Also, except for "This is Halloween" and "What's This?", most of the songs were forgettable. Despite these flaws, I still recommend this for the holidays (or Halloween).

    A beautifully creepy brief movie, were we get a first glimpse of Henry Selick, odd and fascinating thoughts. Tim Burton is as well known for his most unusual ideas, the character and picture we get to familiar ourselves with in this movie is unquestionably deviant. The animation was somewhat new to me, odd, pointy, squeaky eyes, long, short, scary, unlike anything else i could imagine, but i cherished every second of it. I'm not certain what kind of audience they were aiming towards, i can only imagine a child would be frightened by this kind of animation and atmosphere. This movie has to rely a lot on the music involved, so choosing the right composer who is experienced in the spooky/Goth themes is important, Danny Elfman has worked with this before and showed that he is competent enough, and was the perfect choice. Jack, our main character, lives in a Gothic world with monsters and nightmares, were death is around the corner. He stumbles upon this colorful world, which opposite to what he's used to (which is dull colors) this world consists of cheerful, living people and a colorful environment. Jack is a unhappy, dead, creature which feels emptiness and is searching for something unknown, jack, despite being a monster, he only wants to contribute and do good deeds, but doesn't realize they aren't so good after all. One can speculate if there is a moral of this story, i believe that its about not trying to change yourself, and accept yourself for who you are.

    This long animation from Tim Burton is already considered a cult classic and surely a reference from this director. It's visually stunning and it creates characters and "worlds" that can only truly exist in Tim Burton's mindÂ… and it is, in my perspective, its most valuable feature. The plot is very simple and straight to follow but in fact it's what matters the less! The scenarios, the colors, the strange characters, the black humor and its final message are what really matter in this long animation! I think it's a good movie in its particular genreÂ… Just to make notice I watched the 3D version. I score it 7/10.

    I don't know a single person who doesn't love this movie. Tim Burton nailed this one in my eyes, and this is the movie that introduced my generation to him and to claymation as well. I was very young when this movie came out, and yes it scared me but it was the greatest movie ever. This the go-to movie when it's time for Halloween, and Christmas as well, to get you in the spirit! The soundtrack is gold and every song is fantastic and you know most of the words from the first time you see it. It has been almost 20 years since it came out and it still has a cult following, a mega franchise and screaming fans of all ages. Disney was right to pick up the rights for this movie because I guarantee you it has done nothing but given them more money for years to come. It may scare very small children but they will either get over it or come to love it in a couple of years.

    This movie is an all around masterpiece. Burton expresses his wild and beautiful imagination in this vivid and expertly crafted stop motion musical based off of an original poem he wrote. It has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remember, and it's very easy to watch over and over again. It's a wonderful and heartfelt story of discovering one's destiny, and fulfilling dreams. The single most amazing film I have ever seen. I recommend this film to anyone who easily accepts artistic viewing material, and is up for the dark implications of the setting and characters. A fantastic film that is good for any circumstances, whether the viewers be having a date night, sleepover, family movie night, party, or any other setting.

    The Nightmare Before Christmas represents what one might argue to be the most famous and well known stopmotion film of all time. It's one of the few films that generally receive annual viewings, and it's often raved as Tim Burton's best film (despite actually being directed by Henry Selick). Even if this is a case of style over substance, I couldn't help but be enchanted by this visually stunning picture, and I feel this is truly worthy of its cult classic status. Jack Skellington, the hailed leader of Halloweenland wraps up yet another successful Halloween. The entire land loves him, and though Jack receives much adoration, he feels bored with his job, and wants something different. But when Jack accidentally finds himself in Christmastown, his life regains meaning. Loving what he sees, Jack attempts to imitate the holiday, though things go terribly wrong. I have to say, The Nightmare Before Christmas was much different than I expected. While I assumed this would be a dark musical comedy, there's actually very little humor to be found. You might get a few smiles, and maybe a laugh, but The Nightmare Before Christmas is by no means a comedy. It's spellbinding fantasy, that imitates the classic Disney formula, while becoming a genre all of its own. The primary strength of this film, comes from the imagination and the visuals. The story line and setting is highly original. While only Halloweenland and Christmastown is ever seen, we are lead to believe that there's other Holiday themed world as well. It makes one wonder what could await in other lands... As far as the visuals go, this is certainly one of the best looking films I've ever seen. While never overly complex or as technically astounding as modern stopmotion films, The Nightmare Before Christmas boasts a visual style like nothing I've ever seen before. The character designs are brilliant. The landscapes are stunning. The visuals are much of what makes The Nightmare Before Christmas such a famed classic, and that's no surprise. Halloweenland and it's residents are wonderfully wicked, and often more creepy than actually scary. The slightly twisted nature to the setting here is memorable and enchanting. Christmastown recalls memories from How the Grinch Stole Christmas, while providing a much more cheery color palette. Unfortunately, Danny Elfman's songs are less than great. In general, they're forgettable and lacking in fun, and the rhyme schemes are often awkward and hard to follow. The lyrics often seem to force words to rhyme, making the songs slightly unpleasant to listen to at times. This is a shame, because there are so many songs in the film. Still, there are still several good ones, including "This is Halloween," "Kidnap the Sandy Claws," and the phenomenal "What's This?" The cast is nothing too special. Chris Sarandon voices Jack Skellington when talking, while composer and song writer Danny Elfman voices Jack when he's singing. Catherine O'Hara lends a forgettable voice for Sally, the love interest. Ken Page as Oogie Boogie is easily the standout, providing an energetic performance as the main antagonist. While Danny Elfman's songs in the film left something to be desired, his score is, quite possibly, some of his very best work. With some surprisingly jazzy segments (that sounds so much like Randy Newman's work, it's uncanny), and some great recurring musical themes and Christmas tie-ins, this is an excellent and hugely memorable score from Elfman. The main selling point may be the visuals, but that doesn't make this film worth seeing for it's other aspects. The story is very original, Elfman's score is great, and the whole production has imagination to spare. The Nightmare Before Christmas isn't as emotionally satisfying or as hilarious as the best of animated films, but the visuals alone makes this worth seeing.
