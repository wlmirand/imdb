    Wildlife film-maker Ted (Michael Par&eacute;) and his tasty girlfriend Marjorie (Johanna Marlowe) are happily having it off in their jungle tent when they are rudely interrupted by a massive werewolf that proceeds to savage the naked woman with its massive jaws and slash at the poor bloke with its razor-sharp claws. Too late to save his lover, a wounded Ted grabs his shotgun and blows the creature's head off in a welter of gore. Sexy, bloody, and with one hell of an impressive looking monster, writer/director Eric Red's opening scene to Bad Moon is a real corker, which makes it all the more frustrating when the film settles into a more mundane mode, Ted having a hairy time of it coming to terms with being a lycanthrope while putting those he loves most in mortal danger. Thankfully, a couple of cool kills by the gnarly werewolf keep the film ticking along until the fun final&eacute;, in which loyal hound Thor (talented German Shepherd Primo, who puts in the best performance of the film) risks his life to protect Ted's sister Janet (Mariel Hemingway) and her son Brett (Mason Gamble) from being eaten alive by the beast.

    Start of really good, nice dog story, i enjoyed the dogs scenes very much, this movie did have some bloody moments in this. The werewolf in this movie did look a bit scary and did not took fake, like the Paris movie. The transformation scenes was not great but I think it was the descent I felt sorry the little and I was a little bit teary when they took the dog away! (I love dogs too much) The acting form the whole cast was really good. The dog who stole the show as he was fantastic in this movie. I enjoyed it, mostly thanks to the dog! 5 out of 10

    A movie called Bad Moon has to be a werewolf flick, and in fact director Eric Red has crafted a very good one from writer Wayne Smith's book about a Gerhman shepherd and the werewolf who infiltrates his family...er, Pack. Red trims the Pack down to a single Mom (Marielle Hemingway) and her young son (Mason Gamble), but otherwise retains most of the original story. Thor, apparently played by a dog named Primo, is still the hero of the story, though Red (perhaps wisely) doesn't really attempt to duplicate Smith's original feat of telling most of the tale from the dog's point of view. Even so, Thor is central to the plot and Red does a good job of orchestrating the movie's unfolding events so that even if the humans have to carry most of the dramatic weight, Thor's presence and involvement are always underscored. The overall quality of a modern werewolf film depends in large part upon how well the creature comes to life, and in this regard Bad Moon does not disappoint. The werewolf is both frightening and realistic looking, and while it's a bit more wolf-like than the more humanoid creature described in the source novel, it's a terrific piece of FX work. Actor Michael Pare does a good job with the ambiguous role of Uncle Ted, who like most werewolves doesn't really want to be a monster and tries to protect his sister and nephew from himself as long as possible. Naturally, Ted's efforts are for naught, and in the end it all comes down to a fight to the finish between the seemingly invincible werewolf and the loyal Thor. At times Red's script does falter a bit and the film probably never reaches the level of Dog Soldiers or The Wolf Man, but all the same it's a very entertaining creature feature with some great cinematography, a neat monster, and a touching protagonist who is more human than most people I know. There's even a brief clip from the original werewolf film, Werewolf of London. What more do you need?

    Director and screenplay writer Eric Red who also wrote and directed another classic flick, Cohen and Tate 1988 and also wrote other classic flicks, Near Dark 1987 and The Hitcher 1986 has also created another gem in Bad Moon. Starring Michael Pare who has also been in other classic flicks, Rampage 2009, Direct Contact 2009, Seed 2007 and Home Room 2002. Also starring Mariel Memingway. Also starring Mason Gamble. I enjoyed the attack scenes. If you enjoyed this as much as I did then check out other classic werewolf flicks, Big Bad Wolf 2006, Dog Soldiers 2002, Ginger Snaps 2000, Ginger Snaps: Unleashed 2004, Silver Bullet 1985, An American Werewolf in London 1981 and The Wolfman 2010.

    Just as you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, try not to judge a movie by it's pre-credits sequence. I was actually groaning aloud while witnessing the bad acting on display as soon as this movie opened. And things looked like they were about to get a hell of a lot worse with a sub-Showgirls moment of unerotic, sexual writhing. Then a werewolf appeared and some blood was thrown around . . . . and my interest was piqued once again. Moving on from that, Bad Moon introduces the viewer to Janet (Mariel Hemmingway), her son Brett (Mason Gamble aka the boy who was Dennis on screen) and their loyal dog, Thor. Into this small unit comes Janet's brother Ted (Michael Pare), the man involved in the opening unerotic, sexual writhing and werewolf carnage. Thor doesn't really like Ted and it's not too long until everyone, apart from those on screen, knows exactly where the animosity springs from. Director Eric Red is not a bad guy. He's provided those who saw it with the brilliance of Cohen & Tate and he also wrote The Hitcher, a long-time favourite of mine. But here, perhaps because he's adapting from the source novel named "Thor" by Wayne Smith, he feels a little boxed in and restrained. Seeing the title of the source material on screen certainly prepares the viewer for the focus of the movie as the brave family dog goes about the business of trying to keep loved ones safe. The film plays out like some Joe Dante-infused blend of Cat's Eye, Fluke and Silver Bullet which hinders it initially but then makes for a snappy, and highly enjoyable, second half. Acting aside, as it's frankly not worth mentioning anyway, we can judge this first and foremost as a creature feature. In that respect, does it deliver something worth seeing? I'd have to say that it does. Mixing practical make-up, camera trickery and some nice little tricks and cheats here and there, the main beastie is both handsome (in a beastly way) and ferocious. It may not be up there with the best that this particular subgenre has to offer but it's no pathetic pi&ntilde;ata either. So, in summation, the movie overcomes many faults to be something enjoyable and worthy of inclusion in anyone's nostalgic list of movies they inexplicably enjoy. Thanks to the creature design and one solid performance from the canine lead it's a surprisingly sweet-centred horror movie that, strangely enough, perhaps could have used a little less blood on screen to gain some broader appeal (and I never thought I would use THAT sentence in my reviews).

    I remember seeing the trailer of this movie when I was a kid and it seemed very frightening and interesting to see. Never had the chance to see until the day that an cultural event happened in my city and there was one cinema showing horror movies with werewolves and this was one of these films. After a long time in line I watched and at the end I must say that I felt that something was missing and that "Bad Moon" could be a better movie than it is. Ted (Michael Par&eacute;) was bitten by a wolf and now he's a cursed werewolf whose seems to lose control easily. After the visit of his sister Janet (Mariel Hemingway) and her son Brett (Mason Gamble well known for playing Dennis the Menace) into his house and fearing that he may attack some people of the area where he lives (he did that) he moves with them. But there's a surprise for him: The family has a dog named Thor (played by Primo) and they don't seem to like each other. The rest of the movie is Ted's transformations into a werewolf and it's attacks; the dog's always barking and the family's always worried with everything that happens. The visual effects are kind of funny; many of the attacks scenes are strangely cut, looks like the director was afraid to make an too much shocking horror movie, it's not much scary as it looks like (the beginning is very scary but the rest runs too slow). The sound effects are interesting but sometimes this is not enough. Why this was an interesting film? Because of the dog. Yes. Thor (the name of the book which this film is based on) is very interesting, and very well played by Primo. The dog is the main reason of why this movie works, the only one who actually knows more about Ted than his family and he's very underrated, always pushed away from everyone. Why this movie didn't worked? Lack of characters and eventually lack of situations. It didn't had anything special, original about it and many times it gets very boring (but the ending is great). Mariel Hemingway's great, Mason Gamble was better as Dennis (in the last minutes he saved the movie to sink to the bottom, don't ask me how he did that), Michael Par&eacute; is...well, he's okay. If you want to see something of him go watch "Streets of Fire". That's a helluva of a movie. Direction? Good effort but could've be better. Entertaining, not much scary and I give 6 stars.

    Reinforcing that tired old horror clich&eacute; that equates sex with death, Ted Harrison (Michael Pare) is enjoying a spot of rumpy with a comely lass in his tent in the middle of some jungle when she is rudely uprooted and shredded to pieces by a 7ft werewolf. Why Ted and his inamorata  or the werewolf, for that matter  are there in the jungle is never really satisfactorily explained, but that pretty much sums up this movie. Things don't happen for a logical reason, they simply happen to drive the narrative along, regardless of any diversions from rational storytelling they may take. Hence a full moon rises at least three nights in a row, and the stricken Ted seeks to cure his lycanthropy by simply moving in with his sister and nephew. While Ted is being wounded by werewolves, big sister Janet (Mariel Hemingway) is displaying her gutsiness by seeing off a 'flopsy' (Hrothgar Matthews)  a type of grifter who provokes people's pets into attacking them then sues the owner. Unluckily for flopsy, he makes the mistake of trying his scam on her without realising she is a lawyer. A single-mum lawyer at that, who never seems to work and who never talks with her son (Mason Gamble) about his father, or what became of him. But then nobody in this movie has a history outside of its narrow parameters  their lives seem to have begun only with their first scene. The family pet upon which the hapless flopsy tries to work his scam, is Thor, a beautiful German Shepherd who probably gives the best performance of the film, and who has everything worked out a couple of reels before his less observant owner.. Director Eric Red, whose better works include The Hitcher and Body Parts stated that the film was intended as a metaphor for schizophrenia, which seems a little like stating the obvious. Every werewolf story ever created has been a metaphor for schizophrenia  in fact, the nature of the story means they can't help be anything else, so, if you're going to toil over familiar ground you need to dig up something a little fresher than the stale offering given here. The cast numbers only a handful, but there is little attempt to create any feeling of claustrophobia or friction amongst them as Janet slowly begins to realise who is responsible for the grisly deaths. And Red fails to create any measure of suspense as Ted begins to lose his struggle with both the beast inside and any consistency of character. Even Lon Chaney's Larry Talbot indulged in more introspection than Uncle Ted. All he seems to do is fret mildly over the safety of the two people in whose garden he has parked his trailer and handcuff himself to a tree to prevent himself from attacking them  even though he must have a key on his person somewhere to free himself when the transformation is over. The acting is passable, as you would expect from journeymen like Pare and Hemingway, and Primo, the dog who plays Thor, is terrific, but the actors have little meat to their lines and are given little upon which to build believable or sympathetic characters. These are actors playing parts, and you never once forget the fact. But then, it is a horror flick, and the development of character has never been a major facet of the genre. In that respect, in relation to the mountain of trashy horror pics out there in DVDland, Bad Moon stands up pretty well; it's well-made and good-looking, and flashes of Red's talent are (all too) briefly discernible. But, in an age when the old horror icons have been replaced by lunatics in hockey masks or stripy jumpers, that isn't really much of an endorsement.

    ...as Creedence Clearwater Revival would sing. The subject is as old as the hill and I'm sure that 99% of the users have seen at least ten other movies about werewolves ,provided that they are horror and fantasy movies buffs ,of course. This one hits rock bottom.the only originality is that the hero was bitten (why by the way?) in the jungle,while making love with his girl friend who was less lucky and got eaten by the beast. He chooses his sister's wife as a convalescent(?) home ;this woman (Mariel Hemingway is a limited actress,to put it mildly) has a boy (of course very clever) and a dog that gives the best performance of the movie: he looks very intense when he gazes upon Ted's trailer. The rest of the movie is so trite,so hackneyed and so "d&eacute;j&agrave; vu " it's extraordinary people should produce such drivel.One may think that the crook ,at the beginning of the story,will play an important part in the plot: he won't.

    You have a good life. Nice home, nice yard. But one day a relative comes to visit, and you know something's not right about him. You come to find out he's a werewolf. The only problem is, you're the only one who knows. And you're a dog. Werewolves are one of those monsters that come and go in films. After a decade which saw the release of many good werewolf films (the 1980s), there just weren't many films about them in the 1990s. Bad Moon is one of the few good ones that were made during this period. Not an outstanding film by any stretch, but a fun film nonetheless. It features an excellent performance by a German Shepherd as the protagonist, Thor. Worth a look if you're a fan of the genre. Probably not very exciting if you're not.

    I have not read the novel, nor do I particularly intend to. It isn't too difficult to tell that this is basically(that would be completely fine, if it was just, you know, good) a dog movie(right down to the usual near-ending scene of such), with the addition of a werewolf. That likes to play with its food, tends to be utterly incapable of closing its mouth, and the effects of which scream "we paid for this animatronic and darn it, we're gonna use it". The framing seems odd. The pacing only gets to be painful when this tries to build suspense(meanwhile, did it ever occur to them to go for an effective reveal on the creature? Or at least attempt to hide how obviously fake it looks?), with it merely being decent apart from that. The characters, motivations and credibility could use more consistency and quality writing. The script jumps straight into all the pitfalls of clich&eacute;s and predictable developments, and after it makes an effort to change the familiar rules of the lore(presumably to tailor them to what they wanted to do in this), it proceeds to follow them instead of going with what they changed it to. The music isn't always dreadful, but it is considerably grander than the visuals it's put to, once or twice. The acting is adequate, no one really stands out as either strongly positive or negative(and they didn't have a lot to work with). The actor playing the being does have the voice and the appearance to match it. The kid isn't that expressive. This at most barely reaches the running time of a feature-length production. The camera and editing are powerfully uninspired, when at their best. There's some gratuitous sex and violence, and a little language. This can be fun to MST3K, though beyond that, hope for and expect little satisfaction from this mutt of a picture. I recommend this solely to the biggest fans of canine(think Lassie) and/or undead flicks. 5/10

Why this movie didn't worked? Lack of characters and eventually lack of situations. It didn't had anything special, original about it and many times it gets very boring (but the ending is great). Mariel Hemingway's great, Mason Gamble was better as Dennis (in the last minutes he saved the movie to sink to the bottom, don't ask me how he did that), Michael Par&eacute; is...well, he's okay. If you want to see something of him go watch "Streets of Fire". That's a helluva of a movie. Direction? Good effort but could've be better. Entertaining, not much scary and I give 6 stars.

    Reinforcing that tired old horror clich&eacute; that equates sex with death, Ted Harrison (Michael Pare) is enjoying a spot of rumpy with a comely lass in his tent in the middle of some jungle when she is rudely uprooted and shredded to pieces by a 7ft werewolf. Why Ted and his inamorata  or the werewolf, for that matter  are there in the jungle is never really satisfactorily explained, but that pretty much sums up this movie. Things don't happen for a logical reason, they simply happen to drive the narrative along, regardless of any diversions from rational storytelling they may take. Hence a full moon rises at least three nights in a row, and the stricken Ted seeks to cure his lycanthropy by simply moving in with his sister and nephew. While Ted is being wounded by werewolves, big sister Janet (Mariel Hemingway) is displaying her gutsiness by seeing off a 'flopsy' (Hrothgar Matthews)  a type of grifter who provokes people's pets into attacking them then sues the owner. Unluckily for flopsy, he makes the mistake of trying his scam on her without realising she is a lawyer. A single-mum lawyer at that, who never seems to work and who never talks with her son (Mason Gamble) about his father, or what became of him. But then nobody in this movie has a history outside of its narrow parameters  their lives seem to have begun only with their first scene. The family pet upon which the hapless flopsy tries to work his scam, is Thor, a beautiful German Shepherd who probably gives the best performance of the film, and who has everything worked out a couple of reels before his less observant owner.. Director Eric Red, whose better works include The Hitcher and Body Parts stated that the film was intended as a metaphor for schizophrenia, which seems a little like stating the obvious. Every werewolf story ever created has been a metaphor for schizophrenia  in fact, the nature of the story means they can't help be anything else, so, if you're going to toil over familiar ground you need to dig up something a little fresher than the stale offering given here. The cast numbers only a handful, but there is little attempt to create any feeling of claustrophobia or friction amongst them as Janet slowly begins to realise who is responsible for the grisly deaths. And Red fails to create any measure of suspense as Ted begins to lose his struggle with both the beast inside and any consistency of character. Even Lon Chaney's Larry Talbot indulged in more introspection than Uncle Ted. All he seems to do is fret mildly over the safety of the two people in whose garden he has parked his trailer and handcuff himself to a tree to prevent himself from attacking them  even though he must have a key on his person somewhere to free himself when the transformation is over. The acting is passable, as you would expect from journeymen like Pare and Hemingway, and Primo, the dog who plays Thor, is terrific, but the actors have little meat to their lines and are given little upon which to build believable or sympathetic characters. These are actors playing parts, and you never once forget the fact. But then, it is a horror flick, and the development of character has never been a major facet of the genre. In that respect, in relation to the mountain of trashy horror pics out there in DVDland, Bad Moon stands up pretty well; it's well-made and good-looking, and flashes of Red's talent are (all too) briefly discernible. But, in an age when the old horror icons have been replaced by lunatics in hockey masks or stripy jumpers, that isn't really much of an endorsement.

    ...as Creedence Clearwater Revival would sing. The subject is as old as the hill and I'm sure that 99% of the users have seen at least ten other movies about werewolves ,provided that they are horror and fantasy movies buffs ,of course. This one hits rock bottom.the only originality is that the hero was bitten (why by the way?) in the jungle,while making love with his girl friend who was less lucky and got eaten by the beast. He chooses his sister's wife as a convalescent(?) home ;this woman (Mariel Hemingway is a limited actress,to put it mildly) has a boy (of course very clever) and a dog that gives the best performance of the movie: he looks very intense when he gazes upon Ted's trailer. The rest of the movie is so trite,so hackneyed and so "d&eacute;j&agrave; vu " it's extraordinary people should produce such drivel.One may think that the crook ,at the beginning of the story,will play an important part in the plot: he won't.

    You have a good life. Nice home, nice yard. But one day a relative comes to visit, and you know something's not right about him. You come to find out he's a werewolf. The only problem is, you're the only one who knows. And you're a dog. Werewolves are one of those monsters that come and go in films. After a decade which saw the release of many good werewolf films (the 1980s), there just weren't many films about them in the 1990s. Bad Moon is one of the few good ones that were made during this period. Not an outstanding film by any stretch, but a fun film nonetheless. It features an excellent performance by a German Shepherd as the protagonist, Thor. Worth a look if you're a fan of the genre. Probably not very exciting if you're not.

    I have not read the novel, nor do I particularly intend to. It isn't too difficult to tell that this is basically(that would be completely fine, if it was just, you know, good) a dog movie(right down to the usual near-ending scene of such), with the addition of a werewolf. That likes to play with its food, tends to be utterly incapable of closing its mouth, and the effects of which scream "we paid for this animatronic and darn it, we're gonna use it". The framing seems odd. The pacing only gets to be painful when this tries to build suspense(meanwhile, did it ever occur to them to go for an effective reveal on the creature? Or at least attempt to hide how obviously fake it looks?), with it merely being decent apart from that. The characters, motivations and credibility could use more consistency and quality writing. The script jumps straight into all the pitfalls of clich&eacute;s and predictable developments, and after it makes an effort to change the familiar rules of the lore(presumably to tailor them to what they wanted to do in this), it proceeds to follow them instead of going with what they changed it to. The music isn't always dreadful, but it is considerably grander than the visuals it's put to, once or twice. The acting is adequate, no one really stands out as either strongly positive or negative(and they didn't have a lot to work with). The actor playing the being does have the voice and the appearance to match it. The kid isn't that expressive. This at most barely reaches the running time of a feature-length production. The camera and editing are powerfully uninspired, when at their best. There's some gratuitous sex and violence, and a little language. This can be fun to MST3K, though beyond that, hope for and expect little satisfaction from this mutt of a picture. I recommend this solely to the biggest fans of canine(think Lassie) and/or undead flicks. 5/10

    Wildlife film-maker Ted (Michael Par&eacute;) and his tasty girlfriend Marjorie (Johanna Marlowe) are happily having it off in their jungle tent when they are rudely interrupted by a massive werewolf that proceeds to savage the naked woman with its massive jaws and slash at the poor bloke with its razor-sharp claws. Too late to save his lover, a wounded Ted grabs his shotgun and blows the creature's head off in a welter of gore. Sexy, bloody, and with one hell of an impressive looking monster, writer/director Eric Red's opening scene to Bad Moon is a real corker, which makes it all the more frustrating when the film settles into a more mundane mode, Ted having a hairy time of it coming to terms with being a lycanthrope while putting those he loves most in mortal danger. Thankfully, a couple of cool kills by the gnarly werewolf keep the film ticking along until the fun final&eacute;, in which loyal hound Thor (talented German Shepherd Primo, who puts in the best performance of the film) risks his life to protect Ted's sister Janet (Mariel Hemingway) and her son Brett (Mason Gamble) from being eaten alive by the beast.

    Start of really good, nice dog story, i enjoyed the dogs scenes very much, this movie did have some bloody moments in this. The werewolf in this movie did look a bit scary and did not took fake, like the Paris movie. The transformation scenes was not great but I think it was the descent I felt sorry the little and I was a little bit teary when they took the dog away! (I love dogs too much) The acting form the whole cast was really good. The dog who stole the show as he was fantastic in this movie. I enjoyed it, mostly thanks to the dog! 5 out of 10

    A movie called Bad Moon has to be a werewolf flick, and in fact director Eric Red has crafted a very good one from writer Wayne Smith's book about a Gerhman shepherd and the werewolf who infiltrates his family...er, Pack. Red trims the Pack down to a single Mom (Marielle Hemingway) and her young son (Mason Gamble), but otherwise retains most of the original story. Thor, apparently played by a dog named Primo, is still the hero of the story, though Red (perhaps wisely) doesn't really attempt to duplicate Smith's original feat of telling most of the tale from the dog's point of view. Even so, Thor is central to the plot and Red does a good job of orchestrating the movie's unfolding events so that even if the humans have to carry most of the dramatic weight, Thor's presence and involvement are always underscored. The overall quality of a modern werewolf film depends in large part upon how well the creature comes to life, and in this regard Bad Moon does not disappoint. The werewolf is both frightening and realistic looking, and while it's a bit more wolf-like than the more humanoid creature described in the source novel, it's a terrific piece of FX work. Actor Michael Pare does a good job with the ambiguous role of Uncle Ted, who like most werewolves doesn't really want to be a monster and tries to protect his sister and nephew from himself as long as possible. Naturally, Ted's efforts are for naught, and in the end it all comes down to a fight to the finish between the seemingly invincible werewolf and the loyal Thor. At times Red's script does falter a bit and the film probably never reaches the level of Dog Soldiers or The Wolf Man, but all the same it's a very entertaining creature feature with some great cinematography, a neat monster, and a touching protagonist who is more human than most people I know. There's even a brief clip from the original werewolf film, Werewolf of London. What more do you need?

    Director and screenplay writer Eric Red who also wrote and directed another classic flick, Cohen and Tate 1988 and also wrote other classic flicks, Near Dark 1987 and The Hitcher 1986 has also created another gem in Bad Moon. Starring Michael Pare who has also been in other classic flicks, Rampage 2009, Direct Contact 2009, Seed 2007 and Home Room 2002. Also starring Mariel Memingway. Also starring Mason Gamble. I enjoyed the attack scenes. If you enjoyed this as much as I did then check out other classic werewolf flicks, Big Bad Wolf 2006, Dog Soldiers 2002, Ginger Snaps 2000, Ginger Snaps: Unleashed 2004, Silver Bullet 1985, An American Werewolf in London 1981 and The Wolfman 2010.

    Just as you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, try not to judge a movie by it's pre-credits sequence. I was actually groaning aloud while witnessing the bad acting on display as soon as this movie opened. And things looked like they were about to get a hell of a lot worse with a sub-Showgirls moment of unerotic, sexual writhing. Then a werewolf appeared and some blood was thrown around . . . . and my interest was piqued once again. Moving on from that, Bad Moon introduces the viewer to Janet (Mariel Hemmingway), her son Brett (Mason Gamble aka the boy who was Dennis on screen) and their loyal dog, Thor. Into this small unit comes Janet's brother Ted (Michael Pare), the man involved in the opening unerotic, sexual writhing and werewolf carnage. Thor doesn't really like Ted and it's not too long until everyone, apart from those on screen, knows exactly where the animosity springs from. Director Eric Red is not a bad guy. He's provided those who saw it with the brilliance of Cohen & Tate and he also wrote The Hitcher, a long-time favourite of mine. But here, perhaps because he's adapting from the source novel named "Thor" by Wayne Smith, he feels a little boxed in and restrained. Seeing the title of the source material on screen certainly prepares the viewer for the focus of the movie as the brave family dog goes about the business of trying to keep loved ones safe. The film plays out like some Joe Dante-infused blend of Cat's Eye, Fluke and Silver Bullet which hinders it initially but then makes for a snappy, and highly enjoyable, second half. Acting aside, as it's frankly not worth mentioning anyway, we can judge this first and foremost as a creature feature. In that respect, does it deliver something worth seeing? I'd have to say that it does. Mixing practical make-up, camera trickery and some nice little tricks and cheats here and there, the main beastie is both handsome (in a beastly way) and ferocious. It may not be up there with the best that this particular subgenre has to offer but it's no pathetic pi&ntilde;ata either. So, in summation, the movie overcomes many faults to be something enjoyable and worthy of inclusion in anyone's nostalgic list of movies they inexplicably enjoy. Thanks to the creature design and one solid performance from the canine lead it's a surprisingly sweet-centred horror movie that, strangely enough, perhaps could have used a little less blood on screen to gain some broader appeal (and I never thought I would use THAT sentence in my reviews).

    I remember seeing the trailer of this movie when I was a kid and it seemed very frightening and interesting to see. Never had the chance to see until the day that an cultural event happened in my city and there was one cinema showing horror movies with werewolves and this was one of these films. After a long time in line I watched and at the end I must say that I felt that something was missing and that "Bad Moon" could be a better movie than it is. Ted (Michael Par&eacute;) was bitten by a wolf and now he's a cursed werewolf whose seems to lose control easily. After the visit of his sister Janet (Mariel Hemingway) and her son Brett (Mason Gamble well known for playing Dennis the Menace) into his house and fearing that he may attack some people of the area where he lives (he did that) he moves with them. But there's a surprise for him: The family has a dog named Thor (played by Primo) and they don't seem to like each other. The rest of the movie is Ted's transformations into a werewolf and it's attacks; the dog's always barking and the family's always worried with everything that happens. The visual effects are kind of funny; many of the attacks scenes are strangely cut, looks like the director was afraid to make an too much shocking horror movie, it's not much scary as it looks like (the beginning is very scary but the rest runs too slow). The sound effects are interesting but sometimes this is not enough. Why this was an interesting film? Because of the dog. Yes. Thor (the name of the book which this film is based on) is very interesting, and very well played by Primo. The dog is the main reason of why this movie works, the only one who actually knows more about Ted than his family and he's very underrated, always pushed away from everyone. Why this movie didn't worked? Lack of characters and eventually lack of situations. It didn't had anything special, original about it and many times it gets very boring (but the ending is great). Mariel Hemingway's great, Mason Gamble was better as Dennis (in the last minutes he saved the movie to sink to the bottom, don't ask me how he did that), Michael Par&eacute; is...well, he's okay. If you want to see something of him go watch "Streets of Fire". That's a helluva of a movie. Direction? Good effort but could've be better. Entertaining, not much scary and I give 6 stars.

The overall quality of a modern werewolf film depends in large part upon how well the creature comes to life, and in this regard Bad Moon does not disappoint. The werewolf is both frightening and realistic looking, and while it's a bit more wolf-like than the more humanoid creature described in the source novel, it's a terrific piece of FX work. Actor Michael Pare does a good job with the ambiguous role of Uncle Ted, who like most werewolves doesn't really want to be a monster and tries to protect his sister and nephew from himself as long as possible. Naturally, Ted's efforts are for naught, and in the end it all comes down to a fight to the finish between the seemingly invincible werewolf and the loyal Thor. At times Red's script does falter a bit and the film probably never reaches the level of Dog Soldiers or The Wolf Man, but all the same it's a very entertaining creature feature with some great cinematography, a neat monster, and a touching protagonist who is more human than most people I know. There's even a brief clip from the original werewolf film, Werewolf of London. What more do you need?

    Director and screenplay writer Eric Red who also wrote and directed another classic flick, Cohen and Tate 1988 and also wrote other classic flicks, Near Dark 1987 and The Hitcher 1986 has also created another gem in Bad Moon. Starring Michael Pare who has also been in other classic flicks, Rampage 2009, Direct Contact 2009, Seed 2007 and Home Room 2002. Also starring Mariel Memingway. Also starring Mason Gamble. I enjoyed the attack scenes. If you enjoyed this as much as I did then check out other classic werewolf flicks, Big Bad Wolf 2006, Dog Soldiers 2002, Ginger Snaps 2000, Ginger Snaps: Unleashed 2004, Silver Bullet 1985, An American Werewolf in London 1981 and The Wolfman 2010.

    Just as you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, try not to judge a movie by it's pre-credits sequence. I was actually groaning aloud while witnessing the bad acting on display as soon as this movie opened. And things looked like they were about to get a hell of a lot worse with a sub-Showgirls moment of unerotic, sexual writhing. Then a werewolf appeared and some blood was thrown around . . . . and my interest was piqued once again. Moving on from that, Bad Moon introduces the viewer to Janet (Mariel Hemmingway), her son Brett (Mason Gamble aka the boy who was Dennis on screen) and their loyal dog, Thor. Into this small unit comes Janet's brother Ted (Michael Pare), the man involved in the opening unerotic, sexual writhing and werewolf carnage. Thor doesn't really like Ted and it's not too long until everyone, apart from those on screen, knows exactly where the animosity springs from. Director Eric Red is not a bad guy. He's provided those who saw it with the brilliance of Cohen & Tate and he also wrote The Hitcher, a long-time favourite of mine. But here, perhaps because he's adapting from the source novel named "Thor" by Wayne Smith, he feels a little boxed in and restrained. Seeing the title of the source material on screen certainly prepares the viewer for the focus of the movie as the brave family dog goes about the business of trying to keep loved ones safe. The film plays out like some Joe Dante-infused blend of Cat's Eye, Fluke and Silver Bullet which hinders it initially but then makes for a snappy, and highly enjoyable, second half. Acting aside, as it's frankly not worth mentioning anyway, we can judge this first and foremost as a creature feature. In that respect, does it deliver something worth seeing? I'd have to say that it does. Mixing practical make-up, camera trickery and some nice little tricks and cheats here and there, the main beastie is both handsome (in a beastly way) and ferocious. It may not be up there with the best that this particular subgenre has to offer but it's no pathetic pi&ntilde;ata either. So, in summation, the movie overcomes many faults to be something enjoyable and worthy of inclusion in anyone's nostalgic list of movies they inexplicably enjoy. Thanks to the creature design and one solid performance from the canine lead it's a surprisingly sweet-centred horror movie that, strangely enough, perhaps could have used a little less blood on screen to gain some broader appeal (and I never thought I would use THAT sentence in my reviews).

    I remember seeing the trailer of this movie when I was a kid and it seemed very frightening and interesting to see. Never had the chance to see until the day that an cultural event happened in my city and there was one cinema showing horror movies with werewolves and this was one of these films. After a long time in line I watched and at the end I must say that I felt that something was missing and that "Bad Moon" could be a better movie than it is. Ted (Michael Par&eacute;) was bitten by a wolf and now he's a cursed werewolf whose seems to lose control easily. After the visit of his sister Janet (Mariel Hemingway) and her son Brett (Mason Gamble well known for playing Dennis the Menace) into his house and fearing that he may attack some people of the area where he lives (he did that) he moves with them. But there's a surprise for him: The family has a dog named Thor (played by Primo) and they don't seem to like each other. The rest of the movie is Ted's transformations into a werewolf and it's attacks; the dog's always barking and the family's always worried with everything that happens. The visual effects are kind of funny; many of the attacks scenes are strangely cut, looks like the director was afraid to make an too much shocking horror movie, it's not much scary as it looks like (the beginning is very scary but the rest runs too slow). The sound effects are interesting but sometimes this is not enough. Why this was an interesting film? Because of the dog. Yes. Thor (the name of the book which this film is based on) is very interesting, and very well played by Primo. The dog is the main reason of why this movie works, the only one who actually knows more about Ted than his family and he's very underrated, always pushed away from everyone. Why this movie didn't worked? Lack of characters and eventually lack of situations. It didn't had anything special, original about it and many times it gets very boring (but the ending is great). Mariel Hemingway's great, Mason Gamble was better as Dennis (in the last minutes he saved the movie to sink to the bottom, don't ask me how he did that), Michael Par&eacute; is...well, he's okay. If you want to see something of him go watch "Streets of Fire". That's a helluva of a movie. Direction? Good effort but could've be better. Entertaining, not much scary and I give 6 stars.

    Reinforcing that tired old horror clich&eacute; that equates sex with death, Ted Harrison (Michael Pare) is enjoying a spot of rumpy with a comely lass in his tent in the middle of some jungle when she is rudely uprooted and shredded to pieces by a 7ft werewolf. Why Ted and his inamorata  or the werewolf, for that matter  are there in the jungle is never really satisfactorily explained, but that pretty much sums up this movie. Things don't happen for a logical reason, they simply happen to drive the narrative along, regardless of any diversions from rational storytelling they may take. Hence a full moon rises at least three nights in a row, and the stricken Ted seeks to cure his lycanthropy by simply moving in with his sister and nephew. While Ted is being wounded by werewolves, big sister Janet (Mariel Hemingway) is displaying her gutsiness by seeing off a 'flopsy' (Hrothgar Matthews)  a type of grifter who provokes people's pets into attacking them then sues the owner. Unluckily for flopsy, he makes the mistake of trying his scam on her without realising she is a lawyer. A single-mum lawyer at that, who never seems to work and who never talks with her son (Mason Gamble) about his father, or what became of him. But then nobody in this movie has a history outside of its narrow parameters  their lives seem to have begun only with their first scene. The family pet upon which the hapless flopsy tries to work his scam, is Thor, a beautiful German Shepherd who probably gives the best performance of the film, and who has everything worked out a couple of reels before his less observant owner.. Director Eric Red, whose better works include The Hitcher and Body Parts stated that the film was intended as a metaphor for schizophrenia, which seems a little like stating the obvious. Every werewolf story ever created has been a metaphor for schizophrenia  in fact, the nature of the story means they can't help be anything else, so, if you're going to toil over familiar ground you need to dig up something a little fresher than the stale offering given here. The cast numbers only a handful, but there is little attempt to create any feeling of claustrophobia or friction amongst them as Janet slowly begins to realise who is responsible for the grisly deaths. And Red fails to create any measure of suspense as Ted begins to lose his struggle with both the beast inside and any consistency of character. Even Lon Chaney's Larry Talbot indulged in more introspection than Uncle Ted. All he seems to do is fret mildly over the safety of the two people in whose garden he has parked his trailer and handcuff himself to a tree to prevent himself from attacking them  even though he must have a key on his person somewhere to free himself when the transformation is over. The acting is passable, as you would expect from journeymen like Pare and Hemingway, and Primo, the dog who plays Thor, is terrific, but the actors have little meat to their lines and are given little upon which to build believable or sympathetic characters. These are actors playing parts, and you never once forget the fact. But then, it is a horror flick, and the development of character has never been a major facet of the genre. In that respect, in relation to the mountain of trashy horror pics out there in DVDland, Bad Moon stands up pretty well; it's well-made and good-looking, and flashes of Red's talent are (all too) briefly discernible. But, in an age when the old horror icons have been replaced by lunatics in hockey masks or stripy jumpers, that isn't really much of an endorsement.

    ...as Creedence Clearwater Revival would sing. The subject is as old as the hill and I'm sure that 99% of the users have seen at least ten other movies about werewolves ,provided that they are horror and fantasy movies buffs ,of course. This one hits rock bottom.the only originality is that the hero was bitten (why by the way?) in the jungle,while making love with his girl friend who was less lucky and got eaten by the beast. He chooses his sister's wife as a convalescent(?) home ;this woman (Mariel Hemingway is a limited actress,to put it mildly) has a boy (of course very clever) and a dog that gives the best performance of the movie: he looks very intense when he gazes upon Ted's trailer. The rest of the movie is so trite,so hackneyed and so "d&eacute;j&agrave; vu " it's extraordinary people should produce such drivel.One may think that the crook ,at the beginning of the story,will play an important part in the plot: he won't.

    You have a good life. Nice home, nice yard. But one day a relative comes to visit, and you know something's not right about him. You come to find out he's a werewolf. The only problem is, you're the only one who knows. And you're a dog. Werewolves are one of those monsters that come and go in films. After a decade which saw the release of many good werewolf films (the 1980s), there just weren't many films about them in the 1990s. Bad Moon is one of the few good ones that were made during this period. Not an outstanding film by any stretch, but a fun film nonetheless. It features an excellent performance by a German Shepherd as the protagonist, Thor. Worth a look if you're a fan of the genre. Probably not very exciting if you're not.

    I have not read the novel, nor do I particularly intend to. It isn't too difficult to tell that this is basically(that would be completely fine, if it was just, you know, good) a dog movie(right down to the usual near-ending scene of such), with the addition of a werewolf. That likes to play with its food, tends to be utterly incapable of closing its mouth, and the effects of which scream "we paid for this animatronic and darn it, we're gonna use it". The framing seems odd. The pacing only gets to be painful when this tries to build suspense(meanwhile, did it ever occur to them to go for an effective reveal on the creature? Or at least attempt to hide how obviously fake it looks?), with it merely being decent apart from that. The characters, motivations and credibility could use more consistency and quality writing. The script jumps straight into all the pitfalls of clich&eacute;s and predictable developments, and after it makes an effort to change the familiar rules of the lore(presumably to tailor them to what they wanted to do in this), it proceeds to follow them instead of going with what they changed it to. The music isn't always dreadful, but it is considerably grander than the visuals it's put to, once or twice. The acting is adequate, no one really stands out as either strongly positive or negative(and they didn't have a lot to work with). The actor playing the being does have the voice and the appearance to match it. The kid isn't that expressive. This at most barely reaches the running time of a feature-length production. The camera and editing are powerfully uninspired, when at their best. There's some gratuitous sex and violence, and a little language. This can be fun to MST3K, though beyond that, hope for and expect little satisfaction from this mutt of a picture. I recommend this solely to the biggest fans of canine(think Lassie) and/or undead flicks. 5/10

    Wildlife film-maker Ted (Michael Par&eacute;) and his tasty girlfriend Marjorie (Johanna Marlowe) are happily having it off in their jungle tent when they are rudely interrupted by a massive werewolf that proceeds to savage the naked woman with its massive jaws and slash at the poor bloke with its razor-sharp claws. Too late to save his lover, a wounded Ted grabs his shotgun and blows the creature's head off in a welter of gore. Sexy, bloody, and with one hell of an impressive looking monster, writer/director Eric Red's opening scene to Bad Moon is a real corker, which makes it all the more frustrating when the film settles into a more mundane mode, Ted having a hairy time of it coming to terms with being a lycanthrope while putting those he loves most in mortal danger. Thankfully, a couple of cool kills by the gnarly werewolf keep the film ticking along until the fun final&eacute;, in which loyal hound Thor (talented German Shepherd Primo, who puts in the best performance of the film) risks his life to protect Ted's sister Janet (Mariel Hemingway) and her son Brett (Mason Gamble) from being eaten alive by the beast.

    Start of really good, nice dog story, i enjoyed the dogs scenes very much, this movie did have some bloody moments in this. The werewolf in this movie did look a bit scary and did not took fake, like the Paris movie. The transformation scenes was not great but I think it was the descent I felt sorry the little and I was a little bit teary when they took the dog away! (I love dogs too much) The acting form the whole cast was really good. The dog who stole the show as he was fantastic in this movie. I enjoyed it, mostly thanks to the dog! 5 out of 10

    A movie called Bad Moon has to be a werewolf flick, and in fact director Eric Red has crafted a very good one from writer Wayne Smith's book about a Gerhman shepherd and the werewolf who infiltrates his family...er, Pack. Red trims the Pack down to a single Mom (Marielle Hemingway) and her young son (Mason Gamble), but otherwise retains most of the original story. Thor, apparently played by a dog named Primo, is still the hero of the story, though Red (perhaps wisely) doesn't really attempt to duplicate Smith's original feat of telling most of the tale from the dog's point of view. Even so, Thor is central to the plot and Red does a good job of orchestrating the movie's unfolding events so that even if the humans have to carry most of the dramatic weight, Thor's presence and involvement are always underscored. The overall quality of a modern werewolf film depends in large part upon how well the creature comes to life, and in this regard Bad Moon does not disappoint. The werewolf is both frightening and realistic looking, and while it's a bit more wolf-like than the more humanoid creature described in the source novel, it's a terrific piece of FX work. Actor Michael Pare does a good job with the ambiguous role of Uncle Ted, who like most werewolves doesn't really want to be a monster and tries to protect his sister and nephew from himself as long as possible. Naturally, Ted's efforts are for naught, and in the end it all comes down to a fight to the finish between the seemingly invincible werewolf and the loyal Thor. At times Red's script does falter a bit and the film probably never reaches the level of Dog Soldiers or The Wolf Man, but all the same it's a very entertaining creature feature with some great cinematography, a neat monster, and a touching protagonist who is more human than most people I know. There's even a brief clip from the original werewolf film, Werewolf of London. What more do you need?

The rest of the movie is so trite,so hackneyed and so "d&eacute;j&agrave; vu " it's extraordinary people should produce such drivel.One may think that the crook ,at the beginning of the story,will play an important part in the plot: he won't.

    You have a good life. Nice home, nice yard. But one day a relative comes to visit, and you know something's not right about him. You come to find out he's a werewolf. The only problem is, you're the only one who knows. And you're a dog. Werewolves are one of those monsters that come and go in films. After a decade which saw the release of many good werewolf films (the 1980s), there just weren't many films about them in the 1990s. Bad Moon is one of the few good ones that were made during this period. Not an outstanding film by any stretch, but a fun film nonetheless. It features an excellent performance by a German Shepherd as the protagonist, Thor. Worth a look if you're a fan of the genre. Probably not very exciting if you're not.

    I have not read the novel, nor do I particularly intend to. It isn't too difficult to tell that this is basically(that would be completely fine, if it was just, you know, good) a dog movie(right down to the usual near-ending scene of such), with the addition of a werewolf. That likes to play with its food, tends to be utterly incapable of closing its mouth, and the effects of which scream "we paid for this animatronic and darn it, we're gonna use it". The framing seems odd. The pacing only gets to be painful when this tries to build suspense(meanwhile, did it ever occur to them to go for an effective reveal on the creature? Or at least attempt to hide how obviously fake it looks?), with it merely being decent apart from that. The characters, motivations and credibility could use more consistency and quality writing. The script jumps straight into all the pitfalls of clich&eacute;s and predictable developments, and after it makes an effort to change the familiar rules of the lore(presumably to tailor them to what they wanted to do in this), it proceeds to follow them instead of going with what they changed it to. The music isn't always dreadful, but it is considerably grander than the visuals it's put to, once or twice. The acting is adequate, no one really stands out as either strongly positive or negative(and they didn't have a lot to work with). The actor playing the being does have the voice and the appearance to match it. The kid isn't that expressive. This at most barely reaches the running time of a feature-length production. The camera and editing are powerfully uninspired, when at their best. There's some gratuitous sex and violence, and a little language. This can be fun to MST3K, though beyond that, hope for and expect little satisfaction from this mutt of a picture. I recommend this solely to the biggest fans of canine(think Lassie) and/or undead flicks. 5/10

    Wildlife film-maker Ted (Michael Par&eacute;) and his tasty girlfriend Marjorie (Johanna Marlowe) are happily having it off in their jungle tent when they are rudely interrupted by a massive werewolf that proceeds to savage the naked woman with its massive jaws and slash at the poor bloke with its razor-sharp claws. Too late to save his lover, a wounded Ted grabs his shotgun and blows the creature's head off in a welter of gore. Sexy, bloody, and with one hell of an impressive looking monster, writer/director Eric Red's opening scene to Bad Moon is a real corker, which makes it all the more frustrating when the film settles into a more mundane mode, Ted having a hairy time of it coming to terms with being a lycanthrope while putting those he loves most in mortal danger. Thankfully, a couple of cool kills by the gnarly werewolf keep the film ticking along until the fun final&eacute;, in which loyal hound Thor (talented German Shepherd Primo, who puts in the best performance of the film) risks his life to protect Ted's sister Janet (Mariel Hemingway) and her son Brett (Mason Gamble) from being eaten alive by the beast.

    Start of really good, nice dog story, i enjoyed the dogs scenes very much, this movie did have some bloody moments in this. The werewolf in this movie did look a bit scary and did not took fake, like the Paris movie. The transformation scenes was not great but I think it was the descent I felt sorry the little and I was a little bit teary when they took the dog away! (I love dogs too much) The acting form the whole cast was really good. The dog who stole the show as he was fantastic in this movie. I enjoyed it, mostly thanks to the dog! 5 out of 10

    A movie called Bad Moon has to be a werewolf flick, and in fact director Eric Red has crafted a very good one from writer Wayne Smith's book about a Gerhman shepherd and the werewolf who infiltrates his family...er, Pack. Red trims the Pack down to a single Mom (Marielle Hemingway) and her young son (Mason Gamble), but otherwise retains most of the original story. Thor, apparently played by a dog named Primo, is still the hero of the story, though Red (perhaps wisely) doesn't really attempt to duplicate Smith's original feat of telling most of the tale from the dog's point of view. Even so, Thor is central to the plot and Red does a good job of orchestrating the movie's unfolding events so that even if the humans have to carry most of the dramatic weight, Thor's presence and involvement are always underscored. The overall quality of a modern werewolf film depends in large part upon how well the creature comes to life, and in this regard Bad Moon does not disappoint. The werewolf is both frightening and realistic looking, and while it's a bit more wolf-like than the more humanoid creature described in the source novel, it's a terrific piece of FX work. Actor Michael Pare does a good job with the ambiguous role of Uncle Ted, who like most werewolves doesn't really want to be a monster and tries to protect his sister and nephew from himself as long as possible. Naturally, Ted's efforts are for naught, and in the end it all comes down to a fight to the finish between the seemingly invincible werewolf and the loyal Thor. At times Red's script does falter a bit and the film probably never reaches the level of Dog Soldiers or The Wolf Man, but all the same it's a very entertaining creature feature with some great cinematography, a neat monster, and a touching protagonist who is more human than most people I know. There's even a brief clip from the original werewolf film, Werewolf of London. What more do you need?

    Director and screenplay writer Eric Red who also wrote and directed another classic flick, Cohen and Tate 1988 and also wrote other classic flicks, Near Dark 1987 and The Hitcher 1986 has also created another gem in Bad Moon. Starring Michael Pare who has also been in other classic flicks, Rampage 2009, Direct Contact 2009, Seed 2007 and Home Room 2002. Also starring Mariel Memingway. Also starring Mason Gamble. I enjoyed the attack scenes. If you enjoyed this as much as I did then check out other classic werewolf flicks, Big Bad Wolf 2006, Dog Soldiers 2002, Ginger Snaps 2000, Ginger Snaps: Unleashed 2004, Silver Bullet 1985, An American Werewolf in London 1981 and The Wolfman 2010.

    Just as you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, try not to judge a movie by it's pre-credits sequence. I was actually groaning aloud while witnessing the bad acting on display as soon as this movie opened. And things looked like they were about to get a hell of a lot worse with a sub-Showgirls moment of unerotic, sexual writhing. Then a werewolf appeared and some blood was thrown around . . . . and my interest was piqued once again. Moving on from that, Bad Moon introduces the viewer to Janet (Mariel Hemmingway), her son Brett (Mason Gamble aka the boy who was Dennis on screen) and their loyal dog, Thor. Into this small unit comes Janet's brother Ted (Michael Pare), the man involved in the opening unerotic, sexual writhing and werewolf carnage. Thor doesn't really like Ted and it's not too long until everyone, apart from those on screen, knows exactly where the animosity springs from. Director Eric Red is not a bad guy. He's provided those who saw it with the brilliance of Cohen & Tate and he also wrote The Hitcher, a long-time favourite of mine. But here, perhaps because he's adapting from the source novel named "Thor" by Wayne Smith, he feels a little boxed in and restrained. Seeing the title of the source material on screen certainly prepares the viewer for the focus of the movie as the brave family dog goes about the business of trying to keep loved ones safe. The film plays out like some Joe Dante-infused blend of Cat's Eye, Fluke and Silver Bullet which hinders it initially but then makes for a snappy, and highly enjoyable, second half. Acting aside, as it's frankly not worth mentioning anyway, we can judge this first and foremost as a creature feature. In that respect, does it deliver something worth seeing? I'd have to say that it does. Mixing practical make-up, camera trickery and some nice little tricks and cheats here and there, the main beastie is both handsome (in a beastly way) and ferocious. It may not be up there with the best that this particular subgenre has to offer but it's no pathetic pi&ntilde;ata either. So, in summation, the movie overcomes many faults to be something enjoyable and worthy of inclusion in anyone's nostalgic list of movies they inexplicably enjoy. Thanks to the creature design and one solid performance from the canine lead it's a surprisingly sweet-centred horror movie that, strangely enough, perhaps could have used a little less blood on screen to gain some broader appeal (and I never thought I would use THAT sentence in my reviews).

    I remember seeing the trailer of this movie when I was a kid and it seemed very frightening and interesting to see. Never had the chance to see until the day that an cultural event happened in my city and there was one cinema showing horror movies with werewolves and this was one of these films. After a long time in line I watched and at the end I must say that I felt that something was missing and that "Bad Moon" could be a better movie than it is. Ted (Michael Par&eacute;) was bitten by a wolf and now he's a cursed werewolf whose seems to lose control easily. After the visit of his sister Janet (Mariel Hemingway) and her son Brett (Mason Gamble well known for playing Dennis the Menace) into his house and fearing that he may attack some people of the area where he lives (he did that) he moves with them. But there's a surprise for him: The family has a dog named Thor (played by Primo) and they don't seem to like each other. The rest of the movie is Ted's transformations into a werewolf and it's attacks; the dog's always barking and the family's always worried with everything that happens. The visual effects are kind of funny; many of the attacks scenes are strangely cut, looks like the director was afraid to make an too much shocking horror movie, it's not much scary as it looks like (the beginning is very scary but the rest runs too slow). The sound effects are interesting but sometimes this is not enough. Why this was an interesting film? Because of the dog. Yes. Thor (the name of the book which this film is based on) is very interesting, and very well played by Primo. The dog is the main reason of why this movie works, the only one who actually knows more about Ted than his family and he's very underrated, always pushed away from everyone. Why this movie didn't worked? Lack of characters and eventually lack of situations. It didn't had anything special, original about it and many times it gets very boring (but the ending is great). Mariel Hemingway's great, Mason Gamble was better as Dennis (in the last minutes he saved the movie to sink to the bottom, don't ask me how he did that), Michael Par&eacute; is...well, he's okay. If you want to see something of him go watch "Streets of Fire". That's a helluva of a movie. Direction? Good effort but could've be better. Entertaining, not much scary and I give 6 stars.

    Reinforcing that tired old horror clich&eacute; that equates sex with death, Ted Harrison (Michael Pare) is enjoying a spot of rumpy with a comely lass in his tent in the middle of some jungle when she is rudely uprooted and shredded to pieces by a 7ft werewolf. Why Ted and his inamorata  or the werewolf, for that matter  are there in the jungle is never really satisfactorily explained, but that pretty much sums up this movie. Things don't happen for a logical reason, they simply happen to drive the narrative along, regardless of any diversions from rational storytelling they may take. Hence a full moon rises at least three nights in a row, and the stricken Ted seeks to cure his lycanthropy by simply moving in with his sister and nephew. While Ted is being wounded by werewolves, big sister Janet (Mariel Hemingway) is displaying her gutsiness by seeing off a 'flopsy' (Hrothgar Matthews)  a type of grifter who provokes people's pets into attacking them then sues the owner. Unluckily for flopsy, he makes the mistake of trying his scam on her without realising she is a lawyer. A single-mum lawyer at that, who never seems to work and who never talks with her son (Mason Gamble) about his father, or what became of him. But then nobody in this movie has a history outside of its narrow parameters  their lives seem to have begun only with their first scene. The family pet upon which the hapless flopsy tries to work his scam, is Thor, a beautiful German Shepherd who probably gives the best performance of the film, and who has everything worked out a couple of reels before his less observant owner.. Director Eric Red, whose better works include The Hitcher and Body Parts stated that the film was intended as a metaphor for schizophrenia, which seems a little like stating the obvious. Every werewolf story ever created has been a metaphor for schizophrenia  in fact, the nature of the story means they can't help be anything else, so, if you're going to toil over familiar ground you need to dig up something a little fresher than the stale offering given here. The cast numbers only a handful, but there is little attempt to create any feeling of claustrophobia or friction amongst them as Janet slowly begins to realise who is responsible for the grisly deaths. And Red fails to create any measure of suspense as Ted begins to lose his struggle with both the beast inside and any consistency of character. Even Lon Chaney's Larry Talbot indulged in more introspection than Uncle Ted. All he seems to do is fret mildly over the safety of the two people in whose garden he has parked his trailer and handcuff himself to a tree to prevent himself from attacking them  even though he must have a key on his person somewhere to free himself when the transformation is over. The acting is passable, as you would expect from journeymen like Pare and Hemingway, and Primo, the dog who plays Thor, is terrific, but the actors have little meat to their lines and are given little upon which to build believable or sympathetic characters. These are actors playing parts, and you never once forget the fact. But then, it is a horror flick, and the development of character has never been a major facet of the genre. In that respect, in relation to the mountain of trashy horror pics out there in DVDland, Bad Moon stands up pretty well; it's well-made and good-looking, and flashes of Red's talent are (all too) briefly discernible. But, in an age when the old horror icons have been replaced by lunatics in hockey masks or stripy jumpers, that isn't really much of an endorsement.

    I remember seeing the trailer of this movie when I was a kid and it seemed very frightening and interesting to see. Never had the chance to see until the day that an cultural event happened in my city and there was one cinema showing horror movies with werewolves and this was one of these films. After a long time in line I watched and at the end I must say that I felt that something was missing and that "Bad Moon" could be a better movie than it is. Ted (Michael Par&eacute;) was bitten by a wolf and now he's a cursed werewolf whose seems to lose control easily. After the visit of his sister Janet (Mariel Hemingway) and her son Brett (Mason Gamble well known for playing Dennis the Menace) into his house and fearing that he may attack some people of the area where he lives (he did that) he moves with them. But there's a surprise for him: The family has a dog named Thor (played by Primo) and they don't seem to like each other. The rest of the movie is Ted's transformations into a werewolf and it's attacks; the dog's always barking and the family's always worried with everything that happens. The visual effects are kind of funny; many of the attacks scenes are strangely cut, looks like the director was afraid to make an too much shocking horror movie, it's not much scary as it looks like (the beginning is very scary but the rest runs too slow). The sound effects are interesting but sometimes this is not enough. Why this was an interesting film? Because of the dog. Yes. Thor (the name of the book which this film is based on) is very interesting, and very well played by Primo. The dog is the main reason of why this movie works, the only one who actually knows more about Ted than his family and he's very underrated, always pushed away from everyone. Why this movie didn't worked? Lack of characters and eventually lack of situations. It didn't had anything special, original about it and many times it gets very boring (but the ending is great). Mariel Hemingway's great, Mason Gamble was better as Dennis (in the last minutes he saved the movie to sink to the bottom, don't ask me how he did that), Michael Par&eacute; is...well, he's okay. If you want to see something of him go watch "Streets of Fire". That's a helluva of a movie. Direction? Good effort but could've be better. Entertaining, not much scary and I give 6 stars.

    Reinforcing that tired old horror clich&eacute; that equates sex with death, Ted Harrison (Michael Pare) is enjoying a spot of rumpy with a comely lass in his tent in the middle of some jungle when she is rudely uprooted and shredded to pieces by a 7ft werewolf. Why Ted and his inamorata  or the werewolf, for that matter  are there in the jungle is never really satisfactorily explained, but that pretty much sums up this movie. Things don't happen for a logical reason, they simply happen to drive the narrative along, regardless of any diversions from rational storytelling they may take. Hence a full moon rises at least three nights in a row, and the stricken Ted seeks to cure his lycanthropy by simply moving in with his sister and nephew. While Ted is being wounded by werewolves, big sister Janet (Mariel Hemingway) is displaying her gutsiness by seeing off a 'flopsy' (Hrothgar Matthews)  a type of grifter who provokes people's pets into attacking them then sues the owner. Unluckily for flopsy, he makes the mistake of trying his scam on her without realising she is a lawyer. A single-mum lawyer at that, who never seems to work and who never talks with her son (Mason Gamble) about his father, or what became of him. But then nobody in this movie has a history outside of its narrow parameters  their lives seem to have begun only with their first scene. The family pet upon which the hapless flopsy tries to work his scam, is Thor, a beautiful German Shepherd who probably gives the best performance of the film, and who has everything worked out a couple of reels before his less observant owner.. Director Eric Red, whose better works include The Hitcher and Body Parts stated that the film was intended as a metaphor for schizophrenia, which seems a little like stating the obvious. Every werewolf story ever created has been a metaphor for schizophrenia  in fact, the nature of the story means they can't help be anything else, so, if you're going to toil over familiar ground you need to dig up something a little fresher than the stale offering given here. The cast numbers only a handful, but there is little attempt to create any feeling of claustrophobia or friction amongst them as Janet slowly begins to realise who is responsible for the grisly deaths. And Red fails to create any measure of suspense as Ted begins to lose his struggle with both the beast inside and any consistency of character. Even Lon Chaney's Larry Talbot indulged in more introspection than Uncle Ted. All he seems to do is fret mildly over the safety of the two people in whose garden he has parked his trailer and handcuff himself to a tree to prevent himself from attacking them  even though he must have a key on his person somewhere to free himself when the transformation is over. The acting is passable, as you would expect from journeymen like Pare and Hemingway, and Primo, the dog who plays Thor, is terrific, but the actors have little meat to their lines and are given little upon which to build believable or sympathetic characters. These are actors playing parts, and you never once forget the fact. But then, it is a horror flick, and the development of character has never been a major facet of the genre. In that respect, in relation to the mountain of trashy horror pics out there in DVDland, Bad Moon stands up pretty well; it's well-made and good-looking, and flashes of Red's talent are (all too) briefly discernible. But, in an age when the old horror icons have been replaced by lunatics in hockey masks or stripy jumpers, that isn't really much of an endorsement.

    ...as Creedence Clearwater Revival would sing. The subject is as old as the hill and I'm sure that 99% of the users have seen at least ten other movies about werewolves ,provided that they are horror and fantasy movies buffs ,of course. This one hits rock bottom.the only originality is that the hero was bitten (why by the way?) in the jungle,while making love with his girl friend who was less lucky and got eaten by the beast. He chooses his sister's wife as a convalescent(?) home ;this woman (Mariel Hemingway is a limited actress,to put it mildly) has a boy (of course very clever) and a dog that gives the best performance of the movie: he looks very intense when he gazes upon Ted's trailer. The rest of the movie is so trite,so hackneyed and so "d&eacute;j&agrave; vu " it's extraordinary people should produce such drivel.One may think that the crook ,at the beginning of the story,will play an important part in the plot: he won't.

    You have a good life. Nice home, nice yard. But one day a relative comes to visit, and you know something's not right about him. You come to find out he's a werewolf. The only problem is, you're the only one who knows. And you're a dog. Werewolves are one of those monsters that come and go in films. After a decade which saw the release of many good werewolf films (the 1980s), there just weren't many films about them in the 1990s. Bad Moon is one of the few good ones that were made during this period. Not an outstanding film by any stretch, but a fun film nonetheless. It features an excellent performance by a German Shepherd as the protagonist, Thor. Worth a look if you're a fan of the genre. Probably not very exciting if you're not.

    I have not read the novel, nor do I particularly intend to. It isn't too difficult to tell that this is basically(that would be completely fine, if it was just, you know, good) a dog movie(right down to the usual near-ending scene of such), with the addition of a werewolf. That likes to play with its food, tends to be utterly incapable of closing its mouth, and the effects of which scream "we paid for this animatronic and darn it, we're gonna use it". The framing seems odd. The pacing only gets to be painful when this tries to build suspense(meanwhile, did it ever occur to them to go for an effective reveal on the creature? Or at least attempt to hide how obviously fake it looks?), with it merely being decent apart from that. The characters, motivations and credibility could use more consistency and quality writing. The script jumps straight into all the pitfalls of clich&eacute;s and predictable developments, and after it makes an effort to change the familiar rules of the lore(presumably to tailor them to what they wanted to do in this), it proceeds to follow them instead of going with what they changed it to. The music isn't always dreadful, but it is considerably grander than the visuals it's put to, once or twice. The acting is adequate, no one really stands out as either strongly positive or negative(and they didn't have a lot to work with). The actor playing the being does have the voice and the appearance to match it. The kid isn't that expressive. This at most barely reaches the running time of a feature-length production. The camera and editing are powerfully uninspired, when at their best. There's some gratuitous sex and violence, and a little language. This can be fun to MST3K, though beyond that, hope for and expect little satisfaction from this mutt of a picture. I recommend this solely to the biggest fans of canine(think Lassie) and/or undead flicks. 5/10

    Wildlife film-maker Ted (Michael Par&eacute;) and his tasty girlfriend Marjorie (Johanna Marlowe) are happily having it off in their jungle tent when they are rudely interrupted by a massive werewolf that proceeds to savage the naked woman with its massive jaws and slash at the poor bloke with its razor-sharp claws. Too late to save his lover, a wounded Ted grabs his shotgun and blows the creature's head off in a welter of gore. Sexy, bloody, and with one hell of an impressive looking monster, writer/director Eric Red's opening scene to Bad Moon is a real corker, which makes it all the more frustrating when the film settles into a more mundane mode, Ted having a hairy time of it coming to terms with being a lycanthrope while putting those he loves most in mortal danger. Thankfully, a couple of cool kills by the gnarly werewolf keep the film ticking along until the fun final&eacute;, in which loyal hound Thor (talented German Shepherd Primo, who puts in the best performance of the film) risks his life to protect Ted's sister Janet (Mariel Hemingway) and her son Brett (Mason Gamble) from being eaten alive by the beast.

    Start of really good, nice dog story, i enjoyed the dogs scenes very much, this movie did have some bloody moments in this. The werewolf in this movie did look a bit scary and did not took fake, like the Paris movie. The transformation scenes was not great but I think it was the descent I felt sorry the little and I was a little bit teary when they took the dog away! (I love dogs too much) The acting form the whole cast was really good. The dog who stole the show as he was fantastic in this movie. I enjoyed it, mostly thanks to the dog! 5 out of 10

    A movie called Bad Moon has to be a werewolf flick, and in fact director Eric Red has crafted a very good one from writer Wayne Smith's book about a Gerhman shepherd and the werewolf who infiltrates his family...er, Pack. Red trims the Pack down to a single Mom (Marielle Hemingway) and her young son (Mason Gamble), but otherwise retains most of the original story. Thor, apparently played by a dog named Primo, is still the hero of the story, though Red (perhaps wisely) doesn't really attempt to duplicate Smith's original feat of telling most of the tale from the dog's point of view. Even so, Thor is central to the plot and Red does a good job of orchestrating the movie's unfolding events so that even if the humans have to carry most of the dramatic weight, Thor's presence and involvement are always underscored. The overall quality of a modern werewolf film depends in large part upon how well the creature comes to life, and in this regard Bad Moon does not disappoint. The werewolf is both frightening and realistic looking, and while it's a bit more wolf-like than the more humanoid creature described in the source novel, it's a terrific piece of FX work. Actor Michael Pare does a good job with the ambiguous role of Uncle Ted, who like most werewolves doesn't really want to be a monster and tries to protect his sister and nephew from himself as long as possible. Naturally, Ted's efforts are for naught, and in the end it all comes down to a fight to the finish between the seemingly invincible werewolf and the loyal Thor. At times Red's script does falter a bit and the film probably never reaches the level of Dog Soldiers or The Wolf Man, but all the same it's a very entertaining creature feature with some great cinematography, a neat monster, and a touching protagonist who is more human than most people I know. There's even a brief clip from the original werewolf film, Werewolf of London. What more do you need?

    Director and screenplay writer Eric Red who also wrote and directed another classic flick, Cohen and Tate 1988 and also wrote other classic flicks, Near Dark 1987 and The Hitcher 1986 has also created another gem in Bad Moon. Starring Michael Pare who has also been in other classic flicks, Rampage 2009, Direct Contact 2009, Seed 2007 and Home Room 2002. Also starring Mariel Memingway. Also starring Mason Gamble. I enjoyed the attack scenes. If you enjoyed this as much as I did then check out other classic werewolf flicks, Big Bad Wolf 2006, Dog Soldiers 2002, Ginger Snaps 2000, Ginger Snaps: Unleashed 2004, Silver Bullet 1985, An American Werewolf in London 1981 and The Wolfman 2010.

    Just as you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, try not to judge a movie by it's pre-credits sequence. I was actually groaning aloud while witnessing the bad acting on display as soon as this movie opened. And things looked like they were about to get a hell of a lot worse with a sub-Showgirls moment of unerotic, sexual writhing. Then a werewolf appeared and some blood was thrown around . . . . and my interest was piqued once again. Moving on from that, Bad Moon introduces the viewer to Janet (Mariel Hemmingway), her son Brett (Mason Gamble aka the boy who was Dennis on screen) and their loyal dog, Thor. Into this small unit comes Janet's brother Ted (Michael Pare), the man involved in the opening unerotic, sexual writhing and werewolf carnage. Thor doesn't really like Ted and it's not too long until everyone, apart from those on screen, knows exactly where the animosity springs from. Director Eric Red is not a bad guy. He's provided those who saw it with the brilliance of Cohen & Tate and he also wrote The Hitcher, a long-time favourite of mine. But here, perhaps because he's adapting from the source novel named "Thor" by Wayne Smith, he feels a little boxed in and restrained. Seeing the title of the source material on screen certainly prepares the viewer for the focus of the movie as the brave family dog goes about the business of trying to keep loved ones safe. The film plays out like some Joe Dante-infused blend of Cat's Eye, Fluke and Silver Bullet which hinders it initially but then makes for a snappy, and highly enjoyable, second half. Acting aside, as it's frankly not worth mentioning anyway, we can judge this first and foremost as a creature feature. In that respect, does it deliver something worth seeing? I'd have to say that it does. Mixing practical make-up, camera trickery and some nice little tricks and cheats here and there, the main beastie is both handsome (in a beastly way) and ferocious. It may not be up there with the best that this particular subgenre has to offer but it's no pathetic pi&ntilde;ata either. So, in summation, the movie overcomes many faults to be something enjoyable and worthy of inclusion in anyone's nostalgic list of movies they inexplicably enjoy. Thanks to the creature design and one solid performance from the canine lead it's a surprisingly sweet-centred horror movie that, strangely enough, perhaps could have used a little less blood on screen to gain some broader appeal (and I never thought I would use THAT sentence in my reviews).
