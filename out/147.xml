    Hollywood's favorite spy plot in the post-Cold War era has ultra-secret agencies trying to justify their mission by fabricating new villains to replace the Soviets. In director Renny Harlin's high-octane actioneer "The Long Kiss Goodbye," Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson, the Central Intelligence Agency fakes a terrorist attack at Niagara Falls so Congress won't slash its budget. What the CIA doesn't count on is the return of one of its top assassins, long-believed lifeless, who doesn't take anything lying down. New Line Cinema has cast the "Thelma & Louise" star as New England school teacher Samantha Caine who suffers from amnesia. Eight years earlier, she washed up on the New Jersey coast two months pregnant without a clue to her own identity. Since then she has paid a number of private eyes to recover her memory. When the CIA learns that she is still alive and breathing, the company dispatches a gang of assassins. Meanwhile, sleazy private eye Mitch Henessey ((Samuel L. Jackson of "Pulp Fiction") is a detective who specializes in blackmail. He has found traces of Samantha's past when she was Charlene Baltimore. Scenarist Shane Black, who wrote "Lethal Weapon" (1987) and "The Last Boy Scout" (1991) and more recently "Iron Man 3," penned a trim but improbable screenplay that neatly knits together all the loose ends and packs one hell of a wallop. The dialogue crackles with blasphemous irreverence. Finnish helmer Renny Harlin ("Cliffhanger" and "Die Hard 2: Die Harder") shows that he still has the knack when it comes to orchestrating knock-out action scenes. Harlin and Black kiss off any sense of credibility as their protagonists survive too many crashes and look too cool riddling the bad guys with bullets. Davis acquits herself well as the super-heroine in a gender reversal of James Bond. This is the kind of free-for-all, tongue-in-cheek action epic that media watchdogs like to condemn for its cartoon violence and inappropriate behavior. When Caine becomes Charlie Baltimore, she spews profanities of the worst sort, laps up liquor like ice water and puffs on tobacco cigarettes like a chimney. If you're tired of cooking and watching men destroy the planet, "The Long Kiss Goodnight" is just the kind of rollicking nonsense to set your sights on when you're looking for something memorable with lots of audacious combat sequences. The scene where our heroine is strapped to a water wheel is terrific. Craig Bierko and David Morse make venomous villains. "The Long Kiss Goodnight" never wears out its welcome and it ranks as one of Geena Davis' best action flicks.

    I've read the reviews which panned this movie because it is unrealistic (as opposed to, say...Star Wars, the Bond franchise, the Bourne franchise, Dusk Till Dawn, Indiana Jones, Batman...you name it). I've read that there's too much action, not enough plot (but Fast and Furious number X is knocking 'em dead at the box office--and the "plot" is...?) I've read that amnesia doesn't work that way (but Bourne and Memento were okay--how about the old B&W classic Random Harvest?). Me, I never watched the thing for a lesson in abnormal psychology or traumatic amnesia, and I didn't watch Bruce Willis and Steve Buscemi fly out to an approaching asteroid to learn about space science or well drilling technology, or even Physics 101 (you want realism, the fragments would have destroyed planet Earth, The End). I've read that our or our allied governments would never stage or allow a contract false flag or large scale pre-emptive attack as portrayed by Chapter, in TLKGN (but it was okay in Three Days of the Condor, or in the Tonkin Gulf and a dozen other more recent historical actual events, for that matter). This is nonsense. Someone very high up didn't like the premise and Hollywood came down hard on Shane Black's story (perhaps because they were planning something very like that). It was action/comedy not dissimilar to the Die Hard, etc. franchise, but it was made an example of. If you want to watch a realistic documentary-style production featuring intelligence agencies, then watch The Company or a half-dozen other offerings, NOT an action/comedy romp full of explosions and some of the wittiest dialog since Gross Point Blank. I might just as well complain that documentaries and docu-dramas deserve a 1 out of 10 because they are not funny and move too slowly. I give this movie (which I and my partner own and have watched many times just for the acting and darkly comedic dialog, timing, and delivery) a 10 on it's own merits. Not because some reviewers overseas found it too "Hollywood," or some thought it appealed to 14-year-olds (like 14-year-olds shouldn't be allowed movies aimed at them), or some refused to watch it yet still felt qualified to vote and express an opinion, all the other usual suspect reasons for panning a movie and trying to sound outraged or intelligent, or whatever. Even Ebert was upset that the hero and heroine outran a fireball--see, they never put that in action/comedy movies because everyone knows it's impossible to outrun a fireball. (So what do we do, Rog, just end the movie there? They blew up, The End.) Please, reviewers, if escapist Hollywood action/comedies are not your thing, stop reviewing stuff which offends your literal sensibilities, or which you did not bother to watch. Go review Heidi, or Wuthering Heights, or A River Runs Through it. But what's the point in comparing this sort of thing to Hitchcock and Bergman all the time? This movie is older than the age-group it was written for, and still stands out as a classic of its type (which includes Die Hard and Lethal Weapon). Ten out of ten.

    Geena Davis plays Samantha Caine, an ordinary housewife who cannot remember anything further back than eight years ago. She has a daughter Caitlin (Yvonne Zima) but cannot remember who the father is. Despite the amnesia, she has built a fulfilling life with a new partner. Following a car accident, she begins to remember parts of her previous life. It's complicated. She was Charly Baltimore, an assassin working for the US government. Samuel L Jackson plays private detective Mitch Henessey who Samantha has employed to try to find out about her past. He joins Caine/Baltimore as they become one of the best double acts in the movies. Brian Cox is brilliant in his brief role as Dr Nathan Waldman, who helps her reconstruct her past and has some of the best lines. Though Jackson comes a close second. You like comedy? Some of this stuff is laugh out loud funny. You like action? This is better than Die Hard. You like tough female leads? Check out Ms Davis. Why did this film not get a stack of awards?

    "The Long Kiss GoodNight" is a film that mixes different genres aptly as action, comedy, drama and intrigue. Geena Davis plays "Samantha Caine," a teacher who has lost her memory. After hiring a private detective (Samuel L. Jackson), discover her ancient and violent life as a CIA agent. The script of the film slightly resembles the legendary saga "Bourne". In the 90s it was unusual to see a woman as the star of an action movie. At that time, the action film was exclusively dominated by men, and has a great merit that Geena Davis broke the norm with this movie, and one year earlier with "Cutthroat Island" playing the Pirate "Adams Morgan". After "The Long Kiss GoodNight" Geena Davis got consecrated as action heroine, something unthinkable at the time. And she did 40 years ago, when it was not young girl. The best of the film is the tandem Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson, who exude a good chemistry. Geena Davis was extremely sensual and attractive and did her performance in the two facets of her character, as a housewife and mother on the one hand, and as hard "spy" on the other. As Samuel L. Jackson, his character adds some touches of humor to the film that is fantastic. The script begins with a thriller that traps, but with the passage of minutes the action is completely taking over the film. In conclusion, the film is well made, it is entertaining and exciting. It's not a pretentious film in no time, and it has some scenes to remember.

    The whole time I spent watching this movie, all I could think was: such a shame. The script is tight, funny and packed with highly quotable dialogue, both Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson are giving it their all, and the production team clearly had a considerable budget to back them, but sadly it amounts to a highly anticlimactic viewing experience. The overall pacing and switching of scenes is distracting to say the least, and director Renny Harlin seems to think he can hide his lack of talent for storytelling by staging badly-cut shootouts, chases and explosions, and meanwhile overstretching unnecessary slo-mo shots. Alan Silvestri's score doesn't help much either, as it manages to sound invasive, clich&eacute;d and tired all at once. I mean: he even uses a trademark 'eighties soap saxophone' bit in a potentially great kitchen scene. Thank God they used some great classic songs to keep some kind of pace going, by the likes of Santana, Patti Labelle and, of course, Muddy Waters, whose 'Mannish Boy' is used as an inspired comedic red herring in the screenplay. But those are all sidenotes. If this script had ended up in the hands of an even slightly more original director, this could've become a cult neo-noir action classic.

    I watched this movie a couple of days ago as I have had it in my DVD collection for years. At first I thought it was a female Bourne Identity rip off and then I realised that this came first! The long Kiss Goodnight is packed with witty one liners that would make James Bond proud and it is quite chilling the idea of the West blaming others for terrorist atrocities that they have done themselves. I am talking before 9/11. The movie is smart believable great one liners and a great chemistry between Gina and Samuel. In fact I like this movie so much as soon as I finish this review I am going to watch it again. For those who compare this movie with Bourne, you have to remember that the lost memory angle and being a spy is the only similarity. Okay they are major similarities but Long kiss is light whereas Bourne is a very serious movie. Bourne works hard to make sure innocent bystanders are not caught up in the killing whereas in Long quite a few bystanders bite the dust. Any how well done Gina and well done Samuel I thoroughly enjoy this film and I am extremely happy I have it in my DVD collection.

    Back in the 1990s, I first saw The Long Kiss Goodnight. Despite the low box-office return or public appeal, I really, really enjoyed it. So, when it was presented to me on Amazon for a low, low price on BluRay, I snatched it up, even without having seen it in over 15-16 years. Am I happy about the purchase? Eh, yeah. Since it was cheap. Actually, the over-long film suffered from many problems, but overall, it was actually enjoyable. It's just hard to watch in 2013 following the excellent Bourne Trilogy. (Yeah, just parts 1-3.) You see, the concept is almost identical with the exception of swapping sexes. Here, teacher/good housewife Samantha Caine has a great life with a family, but doesn't remember her life prior to just before giving birth to her daughter and being found on a beach. She hires the best of the best private investigators to find her past and only reaches some success with the bottom of the barrel Mitch. Onlydoes she really want to find herself again? I've always loved Geena Davis, and sad she never got the superstardom as she deserved. And who doesn't, in their right mind, love Samuel L. Jackson? They both play a huge part in this movie's enjoyment. Even though it's really too long, and it's hard to hold this up in a Post-Bourne world, it's still a fun watch.

    When I first saw this movie I expected a lot and was quite disappointed with it. I was prepared to leave it behind as a dull movie, but for some reason I ended up watching it again and I enjoyed it. Having watched it a second time I came to realise that this is quite a witty and clever movie, and it seems that Harlin (who directed Die Hard II) as been influenced in a good way. Please also note that this was originally written in 1996, so some of the comments made in this review are relevant to when it was written. I simply cannot be bothered rewriting the whole thing again, and have decided to leave it as is with only a few modifications. The movie is about a lady, Samantha (Geena Davis), who woke up one day on a beach pregnant and suffering from amnesia. She became a school teacher and found a nice man and moved in with him. Eight years later a nasty criminal sees her and breaks out of gaol to get her, and a private detective (Samual L. Jackson) has found some stuff belonging to her. She also suffers concussion after a car accident and finds that she can do stuff that she couldn't do before. After digging in a little deeper she comes to realise that she used to be a government assassin and was in the middle of a job when she was shot in the head and left for dead on a beach. Things have changed in eight years though, and those that were the enemies before are now allies and are in the middle of a project to raise some funds for the organisation. When agencies talk about fund raising they talk about faking terrorist activities to tell the government that they are needed. This brings up an idea of what the cold war was all about. It was a war were intelligence operatives would live a luxurious lifestyle funded by the paranoia of a nation believing that the Red threat, if not contained, would destroy the world. This is one of the ideas behind the origins of the cold war, and this is pursued in this movie. Now that Russia has opened up, and that we know that they were never really a threat, the need for internal security has vanished. The only problems are with terrorists, and even then very few attacks seem to hit the United States. The threats do not seem to come from the outside, but rather from inside the country. The last true terrorist attack at the time of writing was the Oklahoma City bombing, and that was allegedly caused by a right winged American acting alone, though this is debatable (and when you consider the connection with Waco, it does raise the question of whether McVeigh did act alone). The Columbine massacre was not a terrorist attack as such, but it highlights the fact that threats to the social stability of America comes not from religious fanatics, but from those who are being forced by society to conform, and when they do not want to they are harassed until they lash out at the system that forced them into this situation. Obviously, things have changed a lot since this movie was released, with the September 11th terrorist attacks, but once again it goes to show how the ideas behind this movie hold true to form. The belief among many was that September 11th was pretty much what this movie was about, a set up designed to scare the American people, and congress, into providing funding for the intelligence community, and to given them further powers to intrude into people's lives. Personally, I do not think it was a set up per se, but rather a deliberate blinding to an event that could have been prevented. The idea of being asleep at the wheel is also brought up, once again to enable Congress to reinstate funding to support the intelligence community. Back to the movie. It is a great little movie. The action is good, but what gives it its edge are the characters. Samual L. Jackson is the coolest character as he is s small time detective, or more like a con- that gets caught up in something way over his head. He is a liar and a cheat, but finds himself in a problem too deep when he agrees to help Samantha. When I first saw it, I did not like it, but now I do and recommend it to anybody. Favourite Quote: that dog and my meal do not go well together. It has been licking it's butt for over three hours. Whatever it is trying to dislodge is either gone for good, of there to stay.

    I won't try to push this movie too hard but I find it nearly impossible to believe it only rates 6+ stars. I think it's too touchy-feely for your average action fan and too violent from most rom-com connoisseurs. I guess it falls into that narrow gap reserved for thrillers with snappy dialogue and just a touch of seemingly far-fetched and yet ultimately believable romance. Although I am not the kind of moviegoer who enjoys repeat viewings of a film, I have seen this movie five times over the years and it still entertains me thoroughly. Certain bits of dialogue between the two main stars are unforgettable and quotable, and while the plot may be fairly hackneyed, it contains many elements of a classic tragedy  questions of identity, revenge, uncommon heroism, and self-sacrifice  which have stood the test of time. Beyond that, it ups the ante on most action films through the brilliant comic timing of Geena Davis and Samuel Jackson, its two main leads, who are both as brutal and nonchalant with each other as a couple of teenagers. The one thing the movie clearly lacks is fancy special effects, but when a movie has great actors, great dialogue, and great fun, it hardly seems a deficiency.

    Perhaps there is spoiler here.... Everybody went wild for the Hunger Games this year, but films like Geena Davies ones, in particular this one and "Cutthroat Island", were way ahead as far as women assertiveness and freedom go. I see Geena Davies as the female Bruce Willis, she has that sardonic smile and look that make her film fun. Angeline Jolie is another of my favourite action heroins for the same reason. My favourite line in the film is when she is locked up in an industrial refrigerator at -50C and her little daughter asks her "Are we going to die mummy?" and instead of the usual dribbling series of reassurances a mum would give she says "Noo!.... they are." I also like how when she still doesn't remember who she is she switches from nice sweet little teacher to quick kick ass spy reflexes without even knowing what she is doing. In short this might not be an intellectual film but then again neither "Die hard *" are, and I find Geena Davies a quite good action actress.

The script begins with a thriller that traps, but with the passage of minutes the action is completely taking over the film. In conclusion, the film is well made, it is entertaining and exciting. It's not a pretentious film in no time, and it has some scenes to remember.

    The whole time I spent watching this movie, all I could think was: such a shame. The script is tight, funny and packed with highly quotable dialogue, both Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson are giving it their all, and the production team clearly had a considerable budget to back them, but sadly it amounts to a highly anticlimactic viewing experience. The overall pacing and switching of scenes is distracting to say the least, and director Renny Harlin seems to think he can hide his lack of talent for storytelling by staging badly-cut shootouts, chases and explosions, and meanwhile overstretching unnecessary slo-mo shots. Alan Silvestri's score doesn't help much either, as it manages to sound invasive, clich&eacute;d and tired all at once. I mean: he even uses a trademark 'eighties soap saxophone' bit in a potentially great kitchen scene. Thank God they used some great classic songs to keep some kind of pace going, by the likes of Santana, Patti Labelle and, of course, Muddy Waters, whose 'Mannish Boy' is used as an inspired comedic red herring in the screenplay. But those are all sidenotes. If this script had ended up in the hands of an even slightly more original director, this could've become a cult neo-noir action classic.

    I watched this movie a couple of days ago as I have had it in my DVD collection for years. At first I thought it was a female Bourne Identity rip off and then I realised that this came first! The long Kiss Goodnight is packed with witty one liners that would make James Bond proud and it is quite chilling the idea of the West blaming others for terrorist atrocities that they have done themselves. I am talking before 9/11. The movie is smart believable great one liners and a great chemistry between Gina and Samuel. In fact I like this movie so much as soon as I finish this review I am going to watch it again. For those who compare this movie with Bourne, you have to remember that the lost memory angle and being a spy is the only similarity. Okay they are major similarities but Long kiss is light whereas Bourne is a very serious movie. Bourne works hard to make sure innocent bystanders are not caught up in the killing whereas in Long quite a few bystanders bite the dust. Any how well done Gina and well done Samuel I thoroughly enjoy this film and I am extremely happy I have it in my DVD collection.

    Back in the 1990s, I first saw The Long Kiss Goodnight. Despite the low box-office return or public appeal, I really, really enjoyed it. So, when it was presented to me on Amazon for a low, low price on BluRay, I snatched it up, even without having seen it in over 15-16 years. Am I happy about the purchase? Eh, yeah. Since it was cheap. Actually, the over-long film suffered from many problems, but overall, it was actually enjoyable. It's just hard to watch in 2013 following the excellent Bourne Trilogy. (Yeah, just parts 1-3.) You see, the concept is almost identical with the exception of swapping sexes. Here, teacher/good housewife Samantha Caine has a great life with a family, but doesn't remember her life prior to just before giving birth to her daughter and being found on a beach. She hires the best of the best private investigators to find her past and only reaches some success with the bottom of the barrel Mitch. Onlydoes she really want to find herself again? I've always loved Geena Davis, and sad she never got the superstardom as she deserved. And who doesn't, in their right mind, love Samuel L. Jackson? They both play a huge part in this movie's enjoyment. Even though it's really too long, and it's hard to hold this up in a Post-Bourne world, it's still a fun watch.

    When I first saw this movie I expected a lot and was quite disappointed with it. I was prepared to leave it behind as a dull movie, but for some reason I ended up watching it again and I enjoyed it. Having watched it a second time I came to realise that this is quite a witty and clever movie, and it seems that Harlin (who directed Die Hard II) as been influenced in a good way. Please also note that this was originally written in 1996, so some of the comments made in this review are relevant to when it was written. I simply cannot be bothered rewriting the whole thing again, and have decided to leave it as is with only a few modifications. The movie is about a lady, Samantha (Geena Davis), who woke up one day on a beach pregnant and suffering from amnesia. She became a school teacher and found a nice man and moved in with him. Eight years later a nasty criminal sees her and breaks out of gaol to get her, and a private detective (Samual L. Jackson) has found some stuff belonging to her. She also suffers concussion after a car accident and finds that she can do stuff that she couldn't do before. After digging in a little deeper she comes to realise that she used to be a government assassin and was in the middle of a job when she was shot in the head and left for dead on a beach. Things have changed in eight years though, and those that were the enemies before are now allies and are in the middle of a project to raise some funds for the organisation. When agencies talk about fund raising they talk about faking terrorist activities to tell the government that they are needed. This brings up an idea of what the cold war was all about. It was a war were intelligence operatives would live a luxurious lifestyle funded by the paranoia of a nation believing that the Red threat, if not contained, would destroy the world. This is one of the ideas behind the origins of the cold war, and this is pursued in this movie. Now that Russia has opened up, and that we know that they were never really a threat, the need for internal security has vanished. The only problems are with terrorists, and even then very few attacks seem to hit the United States. The threats do not seem to come from the outside, but rather from inside the country. The last true terrorist attack at the time of writing was the Oklahoma City bombing, and that was allegedly caused by a right winged American acting alone, though this is debatable (and when you consider the connection with Waco, it does raise the question of whether McVeigh did act alone). The Columbine massacre was not a terrorist attack as such, but it highlights the fact that threats to the social stability of America comes not from religious fanatics, but from those who are being forced by society to conform, and when they do not want to they are harassed until they lash out at the system that forced them into this situation. Obviously, things have changed a lot since this movie was released, with the September 11th terrorist attacks, but once again it goes to show how the ideas behind this movie hold true to form. The belief among many was that September 11th was pretty much what this movie was about, a set up designed to scare the American people, and congress, into providing funding for the intelligence community, and to given them further powers to intrude into people's lives. Personally, I do not think it was a set up per se, but rather a deliberate blinding to an event that could have been prevented. The idea of being asleep at the wheel is also brought up, once again to enable Congress to reinstate funding to support the intelligence community. Back to the movie. It is a great little movie. The action is good, but what gives it its edge are the characters. Samual L. Jackson is the coolest character as he is s small time detective, or more like a con- that gets caught up in something way over his head. He is a liar and a cheat, but finds himself in a problem too deep when he agrees to help Samantha. When I first saw it, I did not like it, but now I do and recommend it to anybody. Favourite Quote: that dog and my meal do not go well together. It has been licking it's butt for over three hours. Whatever it is trying to dislodge is either gone for good, of there to stay.

    I won't try to push this movie too hard but I find it nearly impossible to believe it only rates 6+ stars. I think it's too touchy-feely for your average action fan and too violent from most rom-com connoisseurs. I guess it falls into that narrow gap reserved for thrillers with snappy dialogue and just a touch of seemingly far-fetched and yet ultimately believable romance. Although I am not the kind of moviegoer who enjoys repeat viewings of a film, I have seen this movie five times over the years and it still entertains me thoroughly. Certain bits of dialogue between the two main stars are unforgettable and quotable, and while the plot may be fairly hackneyed, it contains many elements of a classic tragedy  questions of identity, revenge, uncommon heroism, and self-sacrifice  which have stood the test of time. Beyond that, it ups the ante on most action films through the brilliant comic timing of Geena Davis and Samuel Jackson, its two main leads, who are both as brutal and nonchalant with each other as a couple of teenagers. The one thing the movie clearly lacks is fancy special effects, but when a movie has great actors, great dialogue, and great fun, it hardly seems a deficiency.

    Perhaps there is spoiler here.... Everybody went wild for the Hunger Games this year, but films like Geena Davies ones, in particular this one and "Cutthroat Island", were way ahead as far as women assertiveness and freedom go. I see Geena Davies as the female Bruce Willis, she has that sardonic smile and look that make her film fun. Angeline Jolie is another of my favourite action heroins for the same reason. My favourite line in the film is when she is locked up in an industrial refrigerator at -50C and her little daughter asks her "Are we going to die mummy?" and instead of the usual dribbling series of reassurances a mum would give she says "Noo!.... they are." I also like how when she still doesn't remember who she is she switches from nice sweet little teacher to quick kick ass spy reflexes without even knowing what she is doing. In short this might not be an intellectual film but then again neither "Die hard *" are, and I find Geena Davies a quite good action actress.

    Hollywood's favorite spy plot in the post-Cold War era has ultra-secret agencies trying to justify their mission by fabricating new villains to replace the Soviets. In director Renny Harlin's high-octane actioneer "The Long Kiss Goodbye," Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson, the Central Intelligence Agency fakes a terrorist attack at Niagara Falls so Congress won't slash its budget. What the CIA doesn't count on is the return of one of its top assassins, long-believed lifeless, who doesn't take anything lying down. New Line Cinema has cast the "Thelma & Louise" star as New England school teacher Samantha Caine who suffers from amnesia. Eight years earlier, she washed up on the New Jersey coast two months pregnant without a clue to her own identity. Since then she has paid a number of private eyes to recover her memory. When the CIA learns that she is still alive and breathing, the company dispatches a gang of assassins. Meanwhile, sleazy private eye Mitch Henessey ((Samuel L. Jackson of "Pulp Fiction") is a detective who specializes in blackmail. He has found traces of Samantha's past when she was Charlene Baltimore. Scenarist Shane Black, who wrote "Lethal Weapon" (1987) and "The Last Boy Scout" (1991) and more recently "Iron Man 3," penned a trim but improbable screenplay that neatly knits together all the loose ends and packs one hell of a wallop. The dialogue crackles with blasphemous irreverence. Finnish helmer Renny Harlin ("Cliffhanger" and "Die Hard 2: Die Harder") shows that he still has the knack when it comes to orchestrating knock-out action scenes. Harlin and Black kiss off any sense of credibility as their protagonists survive too many crashes and look too cool riddling the bad guys with bullets. Davis acquits herself well as the super-heroine in a gender reversal of James Bond. This is the kind of free-for-all, tongue-in-cheek action epic that media watchdogs like to condemn for its cartoon violence and inappropriate behavior. When Caine becomes Charlie Baltimore, she spews profanities of the worst sort, laps up liquor like ice water and puffs on tobacco cigarettes like a chimney. If you're tired of cooking and watching men destroy the planet, "The Long Kiss Goodnight" is just the kind of rollicking nonsense to set your sights on when you're looking for something memorable with lots of audacious combat sequences. The scene where our heroine is strapped to a water wheel is terrific. Craig Bierko and David Morse make venomous villains. "The Long Kiss Goodnight" never wears out its welcome and it ranks as one of Geena Davis' best action flicks.

    I've read the reviews which panned this movie because it is unrealistic (as opposed to, say...Star Wars, the Bond franchise, the Bourne franchise, Dusk Till Dawn, Indiana Jones, Batman...you name it). I've read that there's too much action, not enough plot (but Fast and Furious number X is knocking 'em dead at the box office--and the "plot" is...?) I've read that amnesia doesn't work that way (but Bourne and Memento were okay--how about the old B&W classic Random Harvest?). Me, I never watched the thing for a lesson in abnormal psychology or traumatic amnesia, and I didn't watch Bruce Willis and Steve Buscemi fly out to an approaching asteroid to learn about space science or well drilling technology, or even Physics 101 (you want realism, the fragments would have destroyed planet Earth, The End). I've read that our or our allied governments would never stage or allow a contract false flag or large scale pre-emptive attack as portrayed by Chapter, in TLKGN (but it was okay in Three Days of the Condor, or in the Tonkin Gulf and a dozen other more recent historical actual events, for that matter). This is nonsense. Someone very high up didn't like the premise and Hollywood came down hard on Shane Black's story (perhaps because they were planning something very like that). It was action/comedy not dissimilar to the Die Hard, etc. franchise, but it was made an example of. If you want to watch a realistic documentary-style production featuring intelligence agencies, then watch The Company or a half-dozen other offerings, NOT an action/comedy romp full of explosions and some of the wittiest dialog since Gross Point Blank. I might just as well complain that documentaries and docu-dramas deserve a 1 out of 10 because they are not funny and move too slowly. I give this movie (which I and my partner own and have watched many times just for the acting and darkly comedic dialog, timing, and delivery) a 10 on it's own merits. Not because some reviewers overseas found it too "Hollywood," or some thought it appealed to 14-year-olds (like 14-year-olds shouldn't be allowed movies aimed at them), or some refused to watch it yet still felt qualified to vote and express an opinion, all the other usual suspect reasons for panning a movie and trying to sound outraged or intelligent, or whatever. Even Ebert was upset that the hero and heroine outran a fireball--see, they never put that in action/comedy movies because everyone knows it's impossible to outrun a fireball. (So what do we do, Rog, just end the movie there? They blew up, The End.) Please, reviewers, if escapist Hollywood action/comedies are not your thing, stop reviewing stuff which offends your literal sensibilities, or which you did not bother to watch. Go review Heidi, or Wuthering Heights, or A River Runs Through it. But what's the point in comparing this sort of thing to Hitchcock and Bergman all the time? This movie is older than the age-group it was written for, and still stands out as a classic of its type (which includes Die Hard and Lethal Weapon). Ten out of ten.

    Geena Davis plays Samantha Caine, an ordinary housewife who cannot remember anything further back than eight years ago. She has a daughter Caitlin (Yvonne Zima) but cannot remember who the father is. Despite the amnesia, she has built a fulfilling life with a new partner. Following a car accident, she begins to remember parts of her previous life. It's complicated. She was Charly Baltimore, an assassin working for the US government. Samuel L Jackson plays private detective Mitch Henessey who Samantha has employed to try to find out about her past. He joins Caine/Baltimore as they become one of the best double acts in the movies. Brian Cox is brilliant in his brief role as Dr Nathan Waldman, who helps her reconstruct her past and has some of the best lines. Though Jackson comes a close second. You like comedy? Some of this stuff is laugh out loud funny. You like action? This is better than Die Hard. You like tough female leads? Check out Ms Davis. Why did this film not get a stack of awards?

    "The Long Kiss GoodNight" is a film that mixes different genres aptly as action, comedy, drama and intrigue. Geena Davis plays "Samantha Caine," a teacher who has lost her memory. After hiring a private detective (Samuel L. Jackson), discover her ancient and violent life as a CIA agent. The script of the film slightly resembles the legendary saga "Bourne". In the 90s it was unusual to see a woman as the star of an action movie. At that time, the action film was exclusively dominated by men, and has a great merit that Geena Davis broke the norm with this movie, and one year earlier with "Cutthroat Island" playing the Pirate "Adams Morgan". After "The Long Kiss GoodNight" Geena Davis got consecrated as action heroine, something unthinkable at the time. And she did 40 years ago, when it was not young girl. The best of the film is the tandem Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson, who exude a good chemistry. Geena Davis was extremely sensual and attractive and did her performance in the two facets of her character, as a housewife and mother on the one hand, and as hard "spy" on the other. As Samuel L. Jackson, his character adds some touches of humor to the film that is fantastic. The script begins with a thriller that traps, but with the passage of minutes the action is completely taking over the film. In conclusion, the film is well made, it is entertaining and exciting. It's not a pretentious film in no time, and it has some scenes to remember.

Everybody went wild for the Hunger Games this year, but films like Geena Davies ones, in particular this one and "Cutthroat Island", were way ahead as far as women assertiveness and freedom go. I see Geena Davies as the female Bruce Willis, she has that sardonic smile and look that make her film fun. Angeline Jolie is another of my favourite action heroins for the same reason. My favourite line in the film is when she is locked up in an industrial refrigerator at -50C and her little daughter asks her "Are we going to die mummy?" and instead of the usual dribbling series of reassurances a mum would give she says "Noo!.... they are." I also like how when she still doesn't remember who she is she switches from nice sweet little teacher to quick kick ass spy reflexes without even knowing what she is doing. In short this might not be an intellectual film but then again neither "Die hard *" are, and I find Geena Davies a quite good action actress.

    Hollywood's favorite spy plot in the post-Cold War era has ultra-secret agencies trying to justify their mission by fabricating new villains to replace the Soviets. In director Renny Harlin's high-octane actioneer "The Long Kiss Goodbye," Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson, the Central Intelligence Agency fakes a terrorist attack at Niagara Falls so Congress won't slash its budget. What the CIA doesn't count on is the return of one of its top assassins, long-believed lifeless, who doesn't take anything lying down. New Line Cinema has cast the "Thelma & Louise" star as New England school teacher Samantha Caine who suffers from amnesia. Eight years earlier, she washed up on the New Jersey coast two months pregnant without a clue to her own identity. Since then she has paid a number of private eyes to recover her memory. When the CIA learns that she is still alive and breathing, the company dispatches a gang of assassins. Meanwhile, sleazy private eye Mitch Henessey ((Samuel L. Jackson of "Pulp Fiction") is a detective who specializes in blackmail. He has found traces of Samantha's past when she was Charlene Baltimore. Scenarist Shane Black, who wrote "Lethal Weapon" (1987) and "The Last Boy Scout" (1991) and more recently "Iron Man 3," penned a trim but improbable screenplay that neatly knits together all the loose ends and packs one hell of a wallop. The dialogue crackles with blasphemous irreverence. Finnish helmer Renny Harlin ("Cliffhanger" and "Die Hard 2: Die Harder") shows that he still has the knack when it comes to orchestrating knock-out action scenes. Harlin and Black kiss off any sense of credibility as their protagonists survive too many crashes and look too cool riddling the bad guys with bullets. Davis acquits herself well as the super-heroine in a gender reversal of James Bond. This is the kind of free-for-all, tongue-in-cheek action epic that media watchdogs like to condemn for its cartoon violence and inappropriate behavior. When Caine becomes Charlie Baltimore, she spews profanities of the worst sort, laps up liquor like ice water and puffs on tobacco cigarettes like a chimney. If you're tired of cooking and watching men destroy the planet, "The Long Kiss Goodnight" is just the kind of rollicking nonsense to set your sights on when you're looking for something memorable with lots of audacious combat sequences. The scene where our heroine is strapped to a water wheel is terrific. Craig Bierko and David Morse make venomous villains. "The Long Kiss Goodnight" never wears out its welcome and it ranks as one of Geena Davis' best action flicks.

    I've read the reviews which panned this movie because it is unrealistic (as opposed to, say...Star Wars, the Bond franchise, the Bourne franchise, Dusk Till Dawn, Indiana Jones, Batman...you name it). I've read that there's too much action, not enough plot (but Fast and Furious number X is knocking 'em dead at the box office--and the "plot" is...?) I've read that amnesia doesn't work that way (but Bourne and Memento were okay--how about the old B&W classic Random Harvest?). Me, I never watched the thing for a lesson in abnormal psychology or traumatic amnesia, and I didn't watch Bruce Willis and Steve Buscemi fly out to an approaching asteroid to learn about space science or well drilling technology, or even Physics 101 (you want realism, the fragments would have destroyed planet Earth, The End). I've read that our or our allied governments would never stage or allow a contract false flag or large scale pre-emptive attack as portrayed by Chapter, in TLKGN (but it was okay in Three Days of the Condor, or in the Tonkin Gulf and a dozen other more recent historical actual events, for that matter). This is nonsense. Someone very high up didn't like the premise and Hollywood came down hard on Shane Black's story (perhaps because they were planning something very like that). It was action/comedy not dissimilar to the Die Hard, etc. franchise, but it was made an example of. If you want to watch a realistic documentary-style production featuring intelligence agencies, then watch The Company or a half-dozen other offerings, NOT an action/comedy romp full of explosions and some of the wittiest dialog since Gross Point Blank. I might just as well complain that documentaries and docu-dramas deserve a 1 out of 10 because they are not funny and move too slowly. I give this movie (which I and my partner own and have watched many times just for the acting and darkly comedic dialog, timing, and delivery) a 10 on it's own merits. Not because some reviewers overseas found it too "Hollywood," or some thought it appealed to 14-year-olds (like 14-year-olds shouldn't be allowed movies aimed at them), or some refused to watch it yet still felt qualified to vote and express an opinion, all the other usual suspect reasons for panning a movie and trying to sound outraged or intelligent, or whatever. Even Ebert was upset that the hero and heroine outran a fireball--see, they never put that in action/comedy movies because everyone knows it's impossible to outrun a fireball. (So what do we do, Rog, just end the movie there? They blew up, The End.) Please, reviewers, if escapist Hollywood action/comedies are not your thing, stop reviewing stuff which offends your literal sensibilities, or which you did not bother to watch. Go review Heidi, or Wuthering Heights, or A River Runs Through it. But what's the point in comparing this sort of thing to Hitchcock and Bergman all the time? This movie is older than the age-group it was written for, and still stands out as a classic of its type (which includes Die Hard and Lethal Weapon). Ten out of ten.

    Geena Davis plays Samantha Caine, an ordinary housewife who cannot remember anything further back than eight years ago. She has a daughter Caitlin (Yvonne Zima) but cannot remember who the father is. Despite the amnesia, she has built a fulfilling life with a new partner. Following a car accident, she begins to remember parts of her previous life. It's complicated. She was Charly Baltimore, an assassin working for the US government. Samuel L Jackson plays private detective Mitch Henessey who Samantha has employed to try to find out about her past. He joins Caine/Baltimore as they become one of the best double acts in the movies. Brian Cox is brilliant in his brief role as Dr Nathan Waldman, who helps her reconstruct her past and has some of the best lines. Though Jackson comes a close second. You like comedy? Some of this stuff is laugh out loud funny. You like action? This is better than Die Hard. You like tough female leads? Check out Ms Davis. Why did this film not get a stack of awards?

    "The Long Kiss GoodNight" is a film that mixes different genres aptly as action, comedy, drama and intrigue. Geena Davis plays "Samantha Caine," a teacher who has lost her memory. After hiring a private detective (Samuel L. Jackson), discover her ancient and violent life as a CIA agent. The script of the film slightly resembles the legendary saga "Bourne". In the 90s it was unusual to see a woman as the star of an action movie. At that time, the action film was exclusively dominated by men, and has a great merit that Geena Davis broke the norm with this movie, and one year earlier with "Cutthroat Island" playing the Pirate "Adams Morgan". After "The Long Kiss GoodNight" Geena Davis got consecrated as action heroine, something unthinkable at the time. And she did 40 years ago, when it was not young girl. The best of the film is the tandem Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson, who exude a good chemistry. Geena Davis was extremely sensual and attractive and did her performance in the two facets of her character, as a housewife and mother on the one hand, and as hard "spy" on the other. As Samuel L. Jackson, his character adds some touches of humor to the film that is fantastic. The script begins with a thriller that traps, but with the passage of minutes the action is completely taking over the film. In conclusion, the film is well made, it is entertaining and exciting. It's not a pretentious film in no time, and it has some scenes to remember.

    The whole time I spent watching this movie, all I could think was: such a shame. The script is tight, funny and packed with highly quotable dialogue, both Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson are giving it their all, and the production team clearly had a considerable budget to back them, but sadly it amounts to a highly anticlimactic viewing experience. The overall pacing and switching of scenes is distracting to say the least, and director Renny Harlin seems to think he can hide his lack of talent for storytelling by staging badly-cut shootouts, chases and explosions, and meanwhile overstretching unnecessary slo-mo shots. Alan Silvestri's score doesn't help much either, as it manages to sound invasive, clich&eacute;d and tired all at once. I mean: he even uses a trademark 'eighties soap saxophone' bit in a potentially great kitchen scene. Thank God they used some great classic songs to keep some kind of pace going, by the likes of Santana, Patti Labelle and, of course, Muddy Waters, whose 'Mannish Boy' is used as an inspired comedic red herring in the screenplay. But those are all sidenotes. If this script had ended up in the hands of an even slightly more original director, this could've become a cult neo-noir action classic.

    I watched this movie a couple of days ago as I have had it in my DVD collection for years. At first I thought it was a female Bourne Identity rip off and then I realised that this came first! The long Kiss Goodnight is packed with witty one liners that would make James Bond proud and it is quite chilling the idea of the West blaming others for terrorist atrocities that they have done themselves. I am talking before 9/11. The movie is smart believable great one liners and a great chemistry between Gina and Samuel. In fact I like this movie so much as soon as I finish this review I am going to watch it again. For those who compare this movie with Bourne, you have to remember that the lost memory angle and being a spy is the only similarity. Okay they are major similarities but Long kiss is light whereas Bourne is a very serious movie. Bourne works hard to make sure innocent bystanders are not caught up in the killing whereas in Long quite a few bystanders bite the dust. Any how well done Gina and well done Samuel I thoroughly enjoy this film and I am extremely happy I have it in my DVD collection.

    Back in the 1990s, I first saw The Long Kiss Goodnight. Despite the low box-office return or public appeal, I really, really enjoyed it. So, when it was presented to me on Amazon for a low, low price on BluRay, I snatched it up, even without having seen it in over 15-16 years. Am I happy about the purchase? Eh, yeah. Since it was cheap. Actually, the over-long film suffered from many problems, but overall, it was actually enjoyable. It's just hard to watch in 2013 following the excellent Bourne Trilogy. (Yeah, just parts 1-3.) You see, the concept is almost identical with the exception of swapping sexes. Here, teacher/good housewife Samantha Caine has a great life with a family, but doesn't remember her life prior to just before giving birth to her daughter and being found on a beach. She hires the best of the best private investigators to find her past and only reaches some success with the bottom of the barrel Mitch. Onlydoes she really want to find herself again? I've always loved Geena Davis, and sad she never got the superstardom as she deserved. And who doesn't, in their right mind, love Samuel L. Jackson? They both play a huge part in this movie's enjoyment. Even though it's really too long, and it's hard to hold this up in a Post-Bourne world, it's still a fun watch.

    When I first saw this movie I expected a lot and was quite disappointed with it. I was prepared to leave it behind as a dull movie, but for some reason I ended up watching it again and I enjoyed it. Having watched it a second time I came to realise that this is quite a witty and clever movie, and it seems that Harlin (who directed Die Hard II) as been influenced in a good way. Please also note that this was originally written in 1996, so some of the comments made in this review are relevant to when it was written. I simply cannot be bothered rewriting the whole thing again, and have decided to leave it as is with only a few modifications. The movie is about a lady, Samantha (Geena Davis), who woke up one day on a beach pregnant and suffering from amnesia. She became a school teacher and found a nice man and moved in with him. Eight years later a nasty criminal sees her and breaks out of gaol to get her, and a private detective (Samual L. Jackson) has found some stuff belonging to her. She also suffers concussion after a car accident and finds that she can do stuff that she couldn't do before. After digging in a little deeper she comes to realise that she used to be a government assassin and was in the middle of a job when she was shot in the head and left for dead on a beach. Things have changed in eight years though, and those that were the enemies before are now allies and are in the middle of a project to raise some funds for the organisation. When agencies talk about fund raising they talk about faking terrorist activities to tell the government that they are needed. This brings up an idea of what the cold war was all about. It was a war were intelligence operatives would live a luxurious lifestyle funded by the paranoia of a nation believing that the Red threat, if not contained, would destroy the world. This is one of the ideas behind the origins of the cold war, and this is pursued in this movie. Now that Russia has opened up, and that we know that they were never really a threat, the need for internal security has vanished. The only problems are with terrorists, and even then very few attacks seem to hit the United States. The threats do not seem to come from the outside, but rather from inside the country. The last true terrorist attack at the time of writing was the Oklahoma City bombing, and that was allegedly caused by a right winged American acting alone, though this is debatable (and when you consider the connection with Waco, it does raise the question of whether McVeigh did act alone). The Columbine massacre was not a terrorist attack as such, but it highlights the fact that threats to the social stability of America comes not from religious fanatics, but from those who are being forced by society to conform, and when they do not want to they are harassed until they lash out at the system that forced them into this situation. Obviously, things have changed a lot since this movie was released, with the September 11th terrorist attacks, but once again it goes to show how the ideas behind this movie hold true to form. The belief among many was that September 11th was pretty much what this movie was about, a set up designed to scare the American people, and congress, into providing funding for the intelligence community, and to given them further powers to intrude into people's lives. Personally, I do not think it was a set up per se, but rather a deliberate blinding to an event that could have been prevented. The idea of being asleep at the wheel is also brought up, once again to enable Congress to reinstate funding to support the intelligence community. Back to the movie. It is a great little movie. The action is good, but what gives it its edge are the characters. Samual L. Jackson is the coolest character as he is s small time detective, or more like a con- that gets caught up in something way over his head. He is a liar and a cheat, but finds himself in a problem too deep when he agrees to help Samantha. When I first saw it, I did not like it, but now I do and recommend it to anybody. Favourite Quote: that dog and my meal do not go well together. It has been licking it's butt for over three hours. Whatever it is trying to dislodge is either gone for good, of there to stay.

    I won't try to push this movie too hard but I find it nearly impossible to believe it only rates 6+ stars. I think it's too touchy-feely for your average action fan and too violent from most rom-com connoisseurs. I guess it falls into that narrow gap reserved for thrillers with snappy dialogue and just a touch of seemingly far-fetched and yet ultimately believable romance. Although I am not the kind of moviegoer who enjoys repeat viewings of a film, I have seen this movie five times over the years and it still entertains me thoroughly. Certain bits of dialogue between the two main stars are unforgettable and quotable, and while the plot may be fairly hackneyed, it contains many elements of a classic tragedy  questions of identity, revenge, uncommon heroism, and self-sacrifice  which have stood the test of time. Beyond that, it ups the ante on most action films through the brilliant comic timing of Geena Davis and Samuel Jackson, its two main leads, who are both as brutal and nonchalant with each other as a couple of teenagers. The one thing the movie clearly lacks is fancy special effects, but when a movie has great actors, great dialogue, and great fun, it hardly seems a deficiency.

Thank God they used some great classic songs to keep some kind of pace going, by the likes of Santana, Patti Labelle and, of course, Muddy Waters, whose 'Mannish Boy' is used as an inspired comedic red herring in the screenplay. But those are all sidenotes. If this script had ended up in the hands of an even slightly more original director, this could've become a cult neo-noir action classic.

    I watched this movie a couple of days ago as I have had it in my DVD collection for years. At first I thought it was a female Bourne Identity rip off and then I realised that this came first! The long Kiss Goodnight is packed with witty one liners that would make James Bond proud and it is quite chilling the idea of the West blaming others for terrorist atrocities that they have done themselves. I am talking before 9/11. The movie is smart believable great one liners and a great chemistry between Gina and Samuel. In fact I like this movie so much as soon as I finish this review I am going to watch it again. For those who compare this movie with Bourne, you have to remember that the lost memory angle and being a spy is the only similarity. Okay they are major similarities but Long kiss is light whereas Bourne is a very serious movie. Bourne works hard to make sure innocent bystanders are not caught up in the killing whereas in Long quite a few bystanders bite the dust. Any how well done Gina and well done Samuel I thoroughly enjoy this film and I am extremely happy I have it in my DVD collection.

    Back in the 1990s, I first saw The Long Kiss Goodnight. Despite the low box-office return or public appeal, I really, really enjoyed it. So, when it was presented to me on Amazon for a low, low price on BluRay, I snatched it up, even without having seen it in over 15-16 years. Am I happy about the purchase? Eh, yeah. Since it was cheap. Actually, the over-long film suffered from many problems, but overall, it was actually enjoyable. It's just hard to watch in 2013 following the excellent Bourne Trilogy. (Yeah, just parts 1-3.) You see, the concept is almost identical with the exception of swapping sexes. Here, teacher/good housewife Samantha Caine has a great life with a family, but doesn't remember her life prior to just before giving birth to her daughter and being found on a beach. She hires the best of the best private investigators to find her past and only reaches some success with the bottom of the barrel Mitch. Onlydoes she really want to find herself again? I've always loved Geena Davis, and sad she never got the superstardom as she deserved. And who doesn't, in their right mind, love Samuel L. Jackson? They both play a huge part in this movie's enjoyment. Even though it's really too long, and it's hard to hold this up in a Post-Bourne world, it's still a fun watch.

    When I first saw this movie I expected a lot and was quite disappointed with it. I was prepared to leave it behind as a dull movie, but for some reason I ended up watching it again and I enjoyed it. Having watched it a second time I came to realise that this is quite a witty and clever movie, and it seems that Harlin (who directed Die Hard II) as been influenced in a good way. Please also note that this was originally written in 1996, so some of the comments made in this review are relevant to when it was written. I simply cannot be bothered rewriting the whole thing again, and have decided to leave it as is with only a few modifications. The movie is about a lady, Samantha (Geena Davis), who woke up one day on a beach pregnant and suffering from amnesia. She became a school teacher and found a nice man and moved in with him. Eight years later a nasty criminal sees her and breaks out of gaol to get her, and a private detective (Samual L. Jackson) has found some stuff belonging to her. She also suffers concussion after a car accident and finds that she can do stuff that she couldn't do before. After digging in a little deeper she comes to realise that she used to be a government assassin and was in the middle of a job when she was shot in the head and left for dead on a beach. Things have changed in eight years though, and those that were the enemies before are now allies and are in the middle of a project to raise some funds for the organisation. When agencies talk about fund raising they talk about faking terrorist activities to tell the government that they are needed. This brings up an idea of what the cold war was all about. It was a war were intelligence operatives would live a luxurious lifestyle funded by the paranoia of a nation believing that the Red threat, if not contained, would destroy the world. This is one of the ideas behind the origins of the cold war, and this is pursued in this movie. Now that Russia has opened up, and that we know that they were never really a threat, the need for internal security has vanished. The only problems are with terrorists, and even then very few attacks seem to hit the United States. The threats do not seem to come from the outside, but rather from inside the country. The last true terrorist attack at the time of writing was the Oklahoma City bombing, and that was allegedly caused by a right winged American acting alone, though this is debatable (and when you consider the connection with Waco, it does raise the question of whether McVeigh did act alone). The Columbine massacre was not a terrorist attack as such, but it highlights the fact that threats to the social stability of America comes not from religious fanatics, but from those who are being forced by society to conform, and when they do not want to they are harassed until they lash out at the system that forced them into this situation. Obviously, things have changed a lot since this movie was released, with the September 11th terrorist attacks, but once again it goes to show how the ideas behind this movie hold true to form. The belief among many was that September 11th was pretty much what this movie was about, a set up designed to scare the American people, and congress, into providing funding for the intelligence community, and to given them further powers to intrude into people's lives. Personally, I do not think it was a set up per se, but rather a deliberate blinding to an event that could have been prevented. The idea of being asleep at the wheel is also brought up, once again to enable Congress to reinstate funding to support the intelligence community. Back to the movie. It is a great little movie. The action is good, but what gives it its edge are the characters. Samual L. Jackson is the coolest character as he is s small time detective, or more like a con- that gets caught up in something way over his head. He is a liar and a cheat, but finds himself in a problem too deep when he agrees to help Samantha. When I first saw it, I did not like it, but now I do and recommend it to anybody. Favourite Quote: that dog and my meal do not go well together. It has been licking it's butt for over three hours. Whatever it is trying to dislodge is either gone for good, of there to stay.

    I won't try to push this movie too hard but I find it nearly impossible to believe it only rates 6+ stars. I think it's too touchy-feely for your average action fan and too violent from most rom-com connoisseurs. I guess it falls into that narrow gap reserved for thrillers with snappy dialogue and just a touch of seemingly far-fetched and yet ultimately believable romance. Although I am not the kind of moviegoer who enjoys repeat viewings of a film, I have seen this movie five times over the years and it still entertains me thoroughly. Certain bits of dialogue between the two main stars are unforgettable and quotable, and while the plot may be fairly hackneyed, it contains many elements of a classic tragedy  questions of identity, revenge, uncommon heroism, and self-sacrifice  which have stood the test of time. Beyond that, it ups the ante on most action films through the brilliant comic timing of Geena Davis and Samuel Jackson, its two main leads, who are both as brutal and nonchalant with each other as a couple of teenagers. The one thing the movie clearly lacks is fancy special effects, but when a movie has great actors, great dialogue, and great fun, it hardly seems a deficiency.

    Perhaps there is spoiler here.... Everybody went wild for the Hunger Games this year, but films like Geena Davies ones, in particular this one and "Cutthroat Island", were way ahead as far as women assertiveness and freedom go. I see Geena Davies as the female Bruce Willis, she has that sardonic smile and look that make her film fun. Angeline Jolie is another of my favourite action heroins for the same reason. My favourite line in the film is when she is locked up in an industrial refrigerator at -50C and her little daughter asks her "Are we going to die mummy?" and instead of the usual dribbling series of reassurances a mum would give she says "Noo!.... they are." I also like how when she still doesn't remember who she is she switches from nice sweet little teacher to quick kick ass spy reflexes without even knowing what she is doing. In short this might not be an intellectual film but then again neither "Die hard *" are, and I find Geena Davies a quite good action actress.

    Hollywood's favorite spy plot in the post-Cold War era has ultra-secret agencies trying to justify their mission by fabricating new villains to replace the Soviets. In director Renny Harlin's high-octane actioneer "The Long Kiss Goodbye," Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson, the Central Intelligence Agency fakes a terrorist attack at Niagara Falls so Congress won't slash its budget. What the CIA doesn't count on is the return of one of its top assassins, long-believed lifeless, who doesn't take anything lying down. New Line Cinema has cast the "Thelma & Louise" star as New England school teacher Samantha Caine who suffers from amnesia. Eight years earlier, she washed up on the New Jersey coast two months pregnant without a clue to her own identity. Since then she has paid a number of private eyes to recover her memory. When the CIA learns that she is still alive and breathing, the company dispatches a gang of assassins. Meanwhile, sleazy private eye Mitch Henessey ((Samuel L. Jackson of "Pulp Fiction") is a detective who specializes in blackmail. He has found traces of Samantha's past when she was Charlene Baltimore. Scenarist Shane Black, who wrote "Lethal Weapon" (1987) and "The Last Boy Scout" (1991) and more recently "Iron Man 3," penned a trim but improbable screenplay that neatly knits together all the loose ends and packs one hell of a wallop. The dialogue crackles with blasphemous irreverence. Finnish helmer Renny Harlin ("Cliffhanger" and "Die Hard 2: Die Harder") shows that he still has the knack when it comes to orchestrating knock-out action scenes. Harlin and Black kiss off any sense of credibility as their protagonists survive too many crashes and look too cool riddling the bad guys with bullets. Davis acquits herself well as the super-heroine in a gender reversal of James Bond. This is the kind of free-for-all, tongue-in-cheek action epic that media watchdogs like to condemn for its cartoon violence and inappropriate behavior. When Caine becomes Charlie Baltimore, she spews profanities of the worst sort, laps up liquor like ice water and puffs on tobacco cigarettes like a chimney. If you're tired of cooking and watching men destroy the planet, "The Long Kiss Goodnight" is just the kind of rollicking nonsense to set your sights on when you're looking for something memorable with lots of audacious combat sequences. The scene where our heroine is strapped to a water wheel is terrific. Craig Bierko and David Morse make venomous villains. "The Long Kiss Goodnight" never wears out its welcome and it ranks as one of Geena Davis' best action flicks.

    I've read the reviews which panned this movie because it is unrealistic (as opposed to, say...Star Wars, the Bond franchise, the Bourne franchise, Dusk Till Dawn, Indiana Jones, Batman...you name it). I've read that there's too much action, not enough plot (but Fast and Furious number X is knocking 'em dead at the box office--and the "plot" is...?) I've read that amnesia doesn't work that way (but Bourne and Memento were okay--how about the old B&W classic Random Harvest?). Me, I never watched the thing for a lesson in abnormal psychology or traumatic amnesia, and I didn't watch Bruce Willis and Steve Buscemi fly out to an approaching asteroid to learn about space science or well drilling technology, or even Physics 101 (you want realism, the fragments would have destroyed planet Earth, The End). I've read that our or our allied governments would never stage or allow a contract false flag or large scale pre-emptive attack as portrayed by Chapter, in TLKGN (but it was okay in Three Days of the Condor, or in the Tonkin Gulf and a dozen other more recent historical actual events, for that matter). This is nonsense. Someone very high up didn't like the premise and Hollywood came down hard on Shane Black's story (perhaps because they were planning something very like that). It was action/comedy not dissimilar to the Die Hard, etc. franchise, but it was made an example of. If you want to watch a realistic documentary-style production featuring intelligence agencies, then watch The Company or a half-dozen other offerings, NOT an action/comedy romp full of explosions and some of the wittiest dialog since Gross Point Blank. I might just as well complain that documentaries and docu-dramas deserve a 1 out of 10 because they are not funny and move too slowly. I give this movie (which I and my partner own and have watched many times just for the acting and darkly comedic dialog, timing, and delivery) a 10 on it's own merits. Not because some reviewers overseas found it too "Hollywood," or some thought it appealed to 14-year-olds (like 14-year-olds shouldn't be allowed movies aimed at them), or some refused to watch it yet still felt qualified to vote and express an opinion, all the other usual suspect reasons for panning a movie and trying to sound outraged or intelligent, or whatever. Even Ebert was upset that the hero and heroine outran a fireball--see, they never put that in action/comedy movies because everyone knows it's impossible to outrun a fireball. (So what do we do, Rog, just end the movie there? They blew up, The End.) Please, reviewers, if escapist Hollywood action/comedies are not your thing, stop reviewing stuff which offends your literal sensibilities, or which you did not bother to watch. Go review Heidi, or Wuthering Heights, or A River Runs Through it. But what's the point in comparing this sort of thing to Hitchcock and Bergman all the time? This movie is older than the age-group it was written for, and still stands out as a classic of its type (which includes Die Hard and Lethal Weapon). Ten out of ten.

    Geena Davis plays Samantha Caine, an ordinary housewife who cannot remember anything further back than eight years ago. She has a daughter Caitlin (Yvonne Zima) but cannot remember who the father is. Despite the amnesia, she has built a fulfilling life with a new partner. Following a car accident, she begins to remember parts of her previous life. It's complicated. She was Charly Baltimore, an assassin working for the US government. Samuel L Jackson plays private detective Mitch Henessey who Samantha has employed to try to find out about her past. He joins Caine/Baltimore as they become one of the best double acts in the movies. Brian Cox is brilliant in his brief role as Dr Nathan Waldman, who helps her reconstruct her past and has some of the best lines. Though Jackson comes a close second. You like comedy? Some of this stuff is laugh out loud funny. You like action? This is better than Die Hard. You like tough female leads? Check out Ms Davis. Why did this film not get a stack of awards?

    "The Long Kiss GoodNight" is a film that mixes different genres aptly as action, comedy, drama and intrigue. Geena Davis plays "Samantha Caine," a teacher who has lost her memory. After hiring a private detective (Samuel L. Jackson), discover her ancient and violent life as a CIA agent. The script of the film slightly resembles the legendary saga "Bourne". In the 90s it was unusual to see a woman as the star of an action movie. At that time, the action film was exclusively dominated by men, and has a great merit that Geena Davis broke the norm with this movie, and one year earlier with "Cutthroat Island" playing the Pirate "Adams Morgan". After "The Long Kiss GoodNight" Geena Davis got consecrated as action heroine, something unthinkable at the time. And she did 40 years ago, when it was not young girl. The best of the film is the tandem Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson, who exude a good chemistry. Geena Davis was extremely sensual and attractive and did her performance in the two facets of her character, as a housewife and mother on the one hand, and as hard "spy" on the other. As Samuel L. Jackson, his character adds some touches of humor to the film that is fantastic. The script begins with a thriller that traps, but with the passage of minutes the action is completely taking over the film. In conclusion, the film is well made, it is entertaining and exciting. It's not a pretentious film in no time, and it has some scenes to remember.

    The whole time I spent watching this movie, all I could think was: such a shame. The script is tight, funny and packed with highly quotable dialogue, both Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson are giving it their all, and the production team clearly had a considerable budget to back them, but sadly it amounts to a highly anticlimactic viewing experience. The overall pacing and switching of scenes is distracting to say the least, and director Renny Harlin seems to think he can hide his lack of talent for storytelling by staging badly-cut shootouts, chases and explosions, and meanwhile overstretching unnecessary slo-mo shots. Alan Silvestri's score doesn't help much either, as it manages to sound invasive, clich&eacute;d and tired all at once. I mean: he even uses a trademark 'eighties soap saxophone' bit in a potentially great kitchen scene. Thank God they used some great classic songs to keep some kind of pace going, by the likes of Santana, Patti Labelle and, of course, Muddy Waters, whose 'Mannish Boy' is used as an inspired comedic red herring in the screenplay.

Jackson, the Central Intelligence Agency fakes a terrorist attack at Niagara Falls so Congress won't slash its budget. What the CIA doesn't count on is the return of one of its top assassins, long-believed lifeless, who doesn't take anything lying down. New Line Cinema has cast the "Thelma & Louise" star as New England school teacher Samantha Caine who suffers from amnesia. Eight years earlier, she washed up on the New Jersey coast two months pregnant without a clue to her own identity. Since then she has paid a number of private eyes to recover her memory. When the CIA learns that she is still alive and breathing, the company dispatches a gang of assassins. Meanwhile, sleazy private eye Mitch Henessey ((Samuel L. Jackson of "Pulp Fiction") is a detective who specializes in blackmail. He has found traces of Samantha's past when she was Charlene Baltimore. Scenarist Shane Black, who wrote "Lethal Weapon" (1987) and "The Last Boy Scout" (1991) and more recently "Iron Man 3," penned a trim but improbable screenplay that neatly knits together all the loose ends and packs one hell of a wallop. The dialogue crackles with blasphemous irreverence. Finnish helmer Renny Harlin ("Cliffhanger" and "Die Hard 2: Die Harder") shows that he still has the knack when it comes to orchestrating knock-out action scenes. Harlin and Black kiss off any sense of credibility as their protagonists survive too many crashes and look too cool riddling the bad guys with bullets. Davis acquits herself well as the super-heroine in a gender reversal of James Bond. This is the kind of free-for-all, tongue-in-cheek action epic that media watchdogs like to condemn for its cartoon violence and inappropriate behavior. When Caine becomes Charlie Baltimore, she spews profanities of the worst sort, laps up liquor like ice water and puffs on tobacco cigarettes like a chimney. If you're tired of cooking and watching men destroy the planet, "The Long Kiss Goodnight" is just the kind of rollicking nonsense to set your sights on when you're looking for something memorable with lots of audacious combat sequences. The scene where our heroine is strapped to a water wheel is terrific. Craig Bierko and David Morse make venomous villains. "The Long Kiss Goodnight" never wears out its welcome and it ranks as one of Geena Davis' best action flicks.

    I've read the reviews which panned this movie because it is unrealistic (as opposed to, say...Star Wars, the Bond franchise, the Bourne franchise, Dusk Till Dawn, Indiana Jones, Batman...you name it). I've read that there's too much action, not enough plot (but Fast and Furious number X is knocking 'em dead at the box office--and the "plot" is...?) I've read that amnesia doesn't work that way (but Bourne and Memento were okay--how about the old B&W classic Random Harvest?). Me, I never watched the thing for a lesson in abnormal psychology or traumatic amnesia, and I didn't watch Bruce Willis and Steve Buscemi fly out to an approaching asteroid to learn about space science or well drilling technology, or even Physics 101 (you want realism, the fragments would have destroyed planet Earth, The End). I've read that our or our allied governments would never stage or allow a contract false flag or large scale pre-emptive attack as portrayed by Chapter, in TLKGN (but it was okay in Three Days of the Condor, or in the Tonkin Gulf and a dozen other more recent historical actual events, for that matter). This is nonsense. Someone very high up didn't like the premise and Hollywood came down hard on Shane Black's story (perhaps because they were planning something very like that). It was action/comedy not dissimilar to the Die Hard, etc. franchise, but it was made an example of. If you want to watch a realistic documentary-style production featuring intelligence agencies, then watch The Company or a half-dozen other offerings, NOT an action/comedy romp full of explosions and some of the wittiest dialog since Gross Point Blank. I might just as well complain that documentaries and docu-dramas deserve a 1 out of 10 because they are not funny and move too slowly. I give this movie (which I and my partner own and have watched many times just for the acting and darkly comedic dialog, timing, and delivery) a 10 on it's own merits. Not because some reviewers overseas found it too "Hollywood," or some thought it appealed to 14-year-olds (like 14-year-olds shouldn't be allowed movies aimed at them), or some refused to watch it yet still felt qualified to vote and express an opinion, all the other usual suspect reasons for panning a movie and trying to sound outraged or intelligent, or whatever. Even Ebert was upset that the hero and heroine outran a fireball--see, they never put that in action/comedy movies because everyone knows it's impossible to outrun a fireball. (So what do we do, Rog, just end the movie there? They blew up, The End.) Please, reviewers, if escapist Hollywood action/comedies are not your thing, stop reviewing stuff which offends your literal sensibilities, or which you did not bother to watch. Go review Heidi, or Wuthering Heights, or A River Runs Through it. But what's the point in comparing this sort of thing to Hitchcock and Bergman all the time? This movie is older than the age-group it was written for, and still stands out as a classic of its type (which includes Die Hard and Lethal Weapon). Ten out of ten.

    Geena Davis plays Samantha Caine, an ordinary housewife who cannot remember anything further back than eight years ago. She has a daughter Caitlin (Yvonne Zima) but cannot remember who the father is. Despite the amnesia, she has built a fulfilling life with a new partner. Following a car accident, she begins to remember parts of her previous life. It's complicated. She was Charly Baltimore, an assassin working for the US government. Samuel L Jackson plays private detective Mitch Henessey who Samantha has employed to try to find out about her past. He joins Caine/Baltimore as they become one of the best double acts in the movies. Brian Cox is brilliant in his brief role as Dr Nathan Waldman, who helps her reconstruct her past and has some of the best lines. Though Jackson comes a close second. You like comedy? Some of this stuff is laugh out loud funny. You like action? This is better than Die Hard. You like tough female leads? Check out Ms Davis. Why did this film not get a stack of awards?

    "The Long Kiss GoodNight" is a film that mixes different genres aptly as action, comedy, drama and intrigue. Geena Davis plays "Samantha Caine," a teacher who has lost her memory. After hiring a private detective (Samuel L. Jackson), discover her ancient and violent life as a CIA agent. The script of the film slightly resembles the legendary saga "Bourne". In the 90s it was unusual to see a woman as the star of an action movie. At that time, the action film was exclusively dominated by men, and has a great merit that Geena Davis broke the norm with this movie, and one year earlier with "Cutthroat Island" playing the Pirate "Adams Morgan". After "The Long Kiss GoodNight" Geena Davis got consecrated as action heroine, something unthinkable at the time. And she did 40 years ago, when it was not young girl. The best of the film is the tandem Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson, who exude a good chemistry. Geena Davis was extremely sensual and attractive and did her performance in the two facets of her character, as a housewife and mother on the one hand, and as hard "spy" on the other. As Samuel L. Jackson, his character adds some touches of humor to the film that is fantastic. The script begins with a thriller that traps, but with the passage of minutes the action is completely taking over the film. In conclusion, the film is well made, it is entertaining and exciting. It's not a pretentious film in no time, and it has some scenes to remember.

    The whole time I spent watching this movie, all I could think was: such a shame. The script is tight, funny and packed with highly quotable dialogue, both Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson are giving it their all, and the production team clearly had a considerable budget to back them, but sadly it amounts to a highly anticlimactic viewing experience. The overall pacing and switching of scenes is distracting to say the least, and director Renny Harlin seems to think he can hide his lack of talent for storytelling by staging badly-cut shootouts, chases and explosions, and meanwhile overstretching unnecessary slo-mo shots. Alan Silvestri's score doesn't help much either, as it manages to sound invasive, clich&eacute;d and tired all at once. I mean: he even uses a trademark 'eighties soap saxophone' bit in a potentially great kitchen scene. Thank God they used some great classic songs to keep some kind of pace going, by the likes of Santana, Patti Labelle and, of course, Muddy Waters, whose 'Mannish Boy' is used as an inspired comedic red herring in the screenplay. But those are all sidenotes. If this script had ended up in the hands of an even slightly more original director, this could've become a cult neo-noir action classic.

    I watched this movie a couple of days ago as I have had it in my DVD collection for years. At first I thought it was a female Bourne Identity rip off and then I realised that this came first! The long Kiss Goodnight is packed with witty one liners that would make James Bond proud and it is quite chilling the idea of the West blaming others for terrorist atrocities that they have done themselves. I am talking before 9/11. The movie is smart believable great one liners and a great chemistry between Gina and Samuel. In fact I like this movie so much as soon as I finish this review I am going to watch it again. For those who compare this movie with Bourne, you have to remember that the lost memory angle and being a spy is the only similarity. Okay they are major similarities but Long kiss is light whereas Bourne is a very serious movie. Bourne works hard to make sure innocent bystanders are not caught up in the killing whereas in Long quite a few bystanders bite the dust. Any how well done Gina and well done Samuel I thoroughly enjoy this film and I am extremely happy I have it in my DVD collection.

    Back in the 1990s, I first saw The Long Kiss Goodnight. Despite the low box-office return or public appeal, I really, really enjoyed it. So, when it was presented to me on Amazon for a low, low price on BluRay, I snatched it up, even without having seen it in over 15-16 years. Am I happy about the purchase? Eh, yeah. Since it was cheap. Actually, the over-long film suffered from many problems, but overall, it was actually enjoyable. It's just hard to watch in 2013 following the excellent Bourne Trilogy. (Yeah, just parts 1-3.) You see, the concept is almost identical with the exception of swapping sexes. Here, teacher/good housewife Samantha Caine has a great life with a family, but doesn't remember her life prior to just before giving birth to her daughter and being found on a beach. She hires the best of the best private investigators to find her past and only reaches some success with the bottom of the barrel Mitch. Onlydoes she really want to find herself again? I've always loved Geena Davis, and sad she never got the superstardom as she deserved. And who doesn't, in their right mind, love Samuel L. Jackson? They both play a huge part in this movie's enjoyment. Even though it's really too long, and it's hard to hold this up in a Post-Bourne world, it's still a fun watch.

    When I first saw this movie I expected a lot and was quite disappointed with it. I was prepared to leave it behind as a dull movie, but for some reason I ended up watching it again and I enjoyed it. Having watched it a second time I came to realise that this is quite a witty and clever movie, and it seems that Harlin (who directed Die Hard II) as been influenced in a good way. Please also note that this was originally written in 1996, so some of the comments made in this review are relevant to when it was written. I simply cannot be bothered rewriting the whole thing again, and have decided to leave it as is with only a few modifications. The movie is about a lady, Samantha (Geena Davis), who woke up one day on a beach pregnant and suffering from amnesia. She became a school teacher and found a nice man and moved in with him. Eight years later a nasty criminal sees her and breaks out of gaol to get her, and a private detective (Samual L. Jackson) has found some stuff belonging to her. She also suffers concussion after a car accident and finds that she can do stuff that she couldn't do before. After digging in a little deeper she comes to realise that she used to be a government assassin and was in the middle of a job when she was shot in the head and left for dead on a beach. Things have changed in eight years though, and those that were the enemies before are now allies and are in the middle of a project to raise some funds for the organisation. When agencies talk about fund raising they talk about faking terrorist activities to tell the government that they are needed. This brings up an idea of what the cold war was all about. It was a war were intelligence operatives would live a luxurious lifestyle funded by the paranoia of a nation believing that the Red threat, if not contained, would destroy the world. This is one of the ideas behind the origins of the cold war, and this is pursued in this movie. Now that Russia has opened up, and that we know that they were never really a threat, the need for internal security has vanished. The only problems are with terrorists, and even then very few attacks seem to hit the United States. The threats do not seem to come from the outside, but rather from inside the country. The last true terrorist attack at the time of writing was the Oklahoma City bombing, and that was allegedly caused by a right winged American acting alone, though this is debatable (and when you consider the connection with Waco, it does raise the question of whether McVeigh did act alone). The Columbine massacre was not a terrorist attack as such, but it highlights the fact that threats to the social stability of America comes not from religious fanatics, but from those who are being forced by society to conform, and when they do not want to they are harassed until they lash out at the system that forced them into this situation. Obviously, things have changed a lot since this movie was released, with the September 11th terrorist attacks, but once again it goes to show how the ideas behind this movie hold true to form. The belief among many was that September 11th was pretty much what this movie was about, a set up designed to scare the American people, and congress, into providing funding for the intelligence community, and to given them further powers to intrude into people's lives. Personally, I do not think it was a set up per se, but rather a deliberate blinding to an event that could have been prevented. The idea of being asleep at the wheel is also brought up, once again to enable Congress to reinstate funding to support the intelligence community. Back to the movie. It is a great little movie. The action is good, but what gives it its edge are the characters. Samual L. Jackson is the coolest character as he is s small time detective, or more like a con- that gets caught up in something way over his head. He is a liar and a cheat, but finds himself in a problem too deep when he agrees to help Samantha. When I first saw it, I did not like it, but now I do and recommend it to anybody. Favourite Quote: that dog and my meal do not go well together. It has been licking it's butt for over three hours. Whatever it is trying to dislodge is either gone for good, of there to stay.

    I won't try to push this movie too hard but I find it nearly impossible to believe it only rates 6+ stars. I think it's too touchy-feely for your average action fan and too violent from most rom-com connoisseurs. I guess it falls into that narrow gap reserved for thrillers with snappy dialogue and just a touch of seemingly far-fetched and yet ultimately believable romance. Although I am not the kind of moviegoer who enjoys repeat viewings of a film, I have seen this movie five times over the years and it still entertains me thoroughly. Certain bits of dialogue between the two main stars are unforgettable and quotable, and while the plot may be fairly hackneyed, it contains many elements of a classic tragedy  questions of identity, revenge, uncommon heroism, and self-sacrifice  which have stood the test of time. Beyond that, it ups the ante on most action films through the brilliant comic timing of Geena Davis and Samuel Jackson, its two main leads, who are both as brutal and nonchalant with each other as a couple of teenagers. The one thing the movie clearly lacks is fancy special effects, but when a movie has great actors, great dialogue, and great fun, it hardly seems a deficiency.

    Perhaps there is spoiler here.... Everybody went wild for the Hunger Games this year, but films like Geena Davies ones, in particular this one and "Cutthroat Island", were way ahead as far as women assertiveness and freedom go. I see Geena Davies as the female Bruce Willis, she has that sardonic smile and look that make her film fun. Angeline Jolie is another of my favourite action heroins for the same reason. My favourite line in the film is when she is locked up in an industrial refrigerator at -50C and her little daughter asks her "Are we going to die mummy?" and instead of the usual dribbling series of reassurances a mum would give she says "Noo!.... they are." I also like how when she still doesn't remember who she is she switches from nice sweet little teacher to quick kick ass spy reflexes without even knowing what she is doing. In short this might not be an intellectual film but then again neither "Die hard *" are, and I find Geena Davies a quite good action actress.

For those who compare this movie with Bourne, you have to remember that the lost memory angle and being a spy is the only similarity. Okay they are major similarities but Long kiss is light whereas Bourne is a very serious movie. Bourne works hard to make sure innocent bystanders are not caught up in the killing whereas in Long quite a few bystanders bite the dust. Any how well done Gina and well done Samuel I thoroughly enjoy this film and I am extremely happy I have it in my DVD collection.

    Back in the 1990s, I first saw The Long Kiss Goodnight. Despite the low box-office return or public appeal, I really, really enjoyed it. So, when it was presented to me on Amazon for a low, low price on BluRay, I snatched it up, even without having seen it in over 15-16 years. Am I happy about the purchase? Eh, yeah. Since it was cheap. Actually, the over-long film suffered from many problems, but overall, it was actually enjoyable. It's just hard to watch in 2013 following the excellent Bourne Trilogy. (Yeah, just parts 1-3.) You see, the concept is almost identical with the exception of swapping sexes. Here, teacher/good housewife Samantha Caine has a great life with a family, but doesn't remember her life prior to just before giving birth to her daughter and being found on a beach. She hires the best of the best private investigators to find her past and only reaches some success with the bottom of the barrel Mitch. Onlydoes she really want to find herself again? I've always loved Geena Davis, and sad she never got the superstardom as she deserved. And who doesn't, in their right mind, love Samuel L. Jackson? They both play a huge part in this movie's enjoyment. Even though it's really too long, and it's hard to hold this up in a Post-Bourne world, it's still a fun watch.

    When I first saw this movie I expected a lot and was quite disappointed with it. I was prepared to leave it behind as a dull movie, but for some reason I ended up watching it again and I enjoyed it. Having watched it a second time I came to realise that this is quite a witty and clever movie, and it seems that Harlin (who directed Die Hard II) as been influenced in a good way. Please also note that this was originally written in 1996, so some of the comments made in this review are relevant to when it was written. I simply cannot be bothered rewriting the whole thing again, and have decided to leave it as is with only a few modifications. The movie is about a lady, Samantha (Geena Davis), who woke up one day on a beach pregnant and suffering from amnesia. She became a school teacher and found a nice man and moved in with him. Eight years later a nasty criminal sees her and breaks out of gaol to get her, and a private detective (Samual L. Jackson) has found some stuff belonging to her. She also suffers concussion after a car accident and finds that she can do stuff that she couldn't do before. After digging in a little deeper she comes to realise that she used to be a government assassin and was in the middle of a job when she was shot in the head and left for dead on a beach. Things have changed in eight years though, and those that were the enemies before are now allies and are in the middle of a project to raise some funds for the organisation. When agencies talk about fund raising they talk about faking terrorist activities to tell the government that they are needed. This brings up an idea of what the cold war was all about. It was a war were intelligence operatives would live a luxurious lifestyle funded by the paranoia of a nation believing that the Red threat, if not contained, would destroy the world. This is one of the ideas behind the origins of the cold war, and this is pursued in this movie. Now that Russia has opened up, and that we know that they were never really a threat, the need for internal security has vanished. The only problems are with terrorists, and even then very few attacks seem to hit the United States. The threats do not seem to come from the outside, but rather from inside the country. The last true terrorist attack at the time of writing was the Oklahoma City bombing, and that was allegedly caused by a right winged American acting alone, though this is debatable (and when you consider the connection with Waco, it does raise the question of whether McVeigh did act alone). The Columbine massacre was not a terrorist attack as such, but it highlights the fact that threats to the social stability of America comes not from religious fanatics, but from those who are being forced by society to conform, and when they do not want to they are harassed until they lash out at the system that forced them into this situation. Obviously, things have changed a lot since this movie was released, with the September 11th terrorist attacks, but once again it goes to show how the ideas behind this movie hold true to form. The belief among many was that September 11th was pretty much what this movie was about, a set up designed to scare the American people, and congress, into providing funding for the intelligence community, and to given them further powers to intrude into people's lives. Personally, I do not think it was a set up per se, but rather a deliberate blinding to an event that could have been prevented. The idea of being asleep at the wheel is also brought up, once again to enable Congress to reinstate funding to support the intelligence community. Back to the movie. It is a great little movie. The action is good, but what gives it its edge are the characters. Samual L. Jackson is the coolest character as he is s small time detective, or more like a con- that gets caught up in something way over his head. He is a liar and a cheat, but finds himself in a problem too deep when he agrees to help Samantha. When I first saw it, I did not like it, but now I do and recommend it to anybody. Favourite Quote: that dog and my meal do not go well together. It has been licking it's butt for over three hours. Whatever it is trying to dislodge is either gone for good, of there to stay.

    I won't try to push this movie too hard but I find it nearly impossible to believe it only rates 6+ stars. I think it's too touchy-feely for your average action fan and too violent from most rom-com connoisseurs. I guess it falls into that narrow gap reserved for thrillers with snappy dialogue and just a touch of seemingly far-fetched and yet ultimately believable romance. Although I am not the kind of moviegoer who enjoys repeat viewings of a film, I have seen this movie five times over the years and it still entertains me thoroughly. Certain bits of dialogue between the two main stars are unforgettable and quotable, and while the plot may be fairly hackneyed, it contains many elements of a classic tragedy  questions of identity, revenge, uncommon heroism, and self-sacrifice  which have stood the test of time. Beyond that, it ups the ante on most action films through the brilliant comic timing of Geena Davis and Samuel Jackson, its two main leads, who are both as brutal and nonchalant with each other as a couple of teenagers. The one thing the movie clearly lacks is fancy special effects, but when a movie has great actors, great dialogue, and great fun, it hardly seems a deficiency.

    Perhaps there is spoiler here.... Everybody went wild for the Hunger Games this year, but films like Geena Davies ones, in particular this one and "Cutthroat Island", were way ahead as far as women assertiveness and freedom go. I see Geena Davies as the female Bruce Willis, she has that sardonic smile and look that make her film fun. Angeline Jolie is another of my favourite action heroins for the same reason. My favourite line in the film is when she is locked up in an industrial refrigerator at -50C and her little daughter asks her "Are we going to die mummy?" and instead of the usual dribbling series of reassurances a mum would give she says "Noo!.... they are." I also like how when she still doesn't remember who she is she switches from nice sweet little teacher to quick kick ass spy reflexes without even knowing what she is doing. In short this might not be an intellectual film but then again neither "Die hard *" are, and I find Geena Davies a quite good action actress.

    Hollywood's favorite spy plot in the post-Cold War era has ultra-secret agencies trying to justify their mission by fabricating new villains to replace the Soviets. In director Renny Harlin's high-octane actioneer "The Long Kiss Goodbye," Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson, the Central Intelligence Agency fakes a terrorist attack at Niagara Falls so Congress won't slash its budget. What the CIA doesn't count on is the return of one of its top assassins, long-believed lifeless, who doesn't take anything lying down. New Line Cinema has cast the "Thelma & Louise" star as New England school teacher Samantha Caine who suffers from amnesia. Eight years earlier, she washed up on the New Jersey coast two months pregnant without a clue to her own identity. Since then she has paid a number of private eyes to recover her memory. When the CIA learns that she is still alive and breathing, the company dispatches a gang of assassins. Meanwhile, sleazy private eye Mitch Henessey ((Samuel L. Jackson of "Pulp Fiction") is a detective who specializes in blackmail. He has found traces of Samantha's past when she was Charlene Baltimore. Scenarist Shane Black, who wrote "Lethal Weapon" (1987) and "The Last Boy Scout" (1991) and more recently "Iron Man 3," penned a trim but improbable screenplay that neatly knits together all the loose ends and packs one hell of a wallop. The dialogue crackles with blasphemous irreverence. Finnish helmer Renny Harlin ("Cliffhanger" and "Die Hard 2: Die Harder") shows that he still has the knack when it comes to orchestrating knock-out action scenes. Harlin and Black kiss off any sense of credibility as their protagonists survive too many crashes and look too cool riddling the bad guys with bullets. Davis acquits herself well as the super-heroine in a gender reversal of James Bond. This is the kind of free-for-all, tongue-in-cheek action epic that media watchdogs like to condemn for its cartoon violence and inappropriate behavior. When Caine becomes Charlie Baltimore, she spews profanities of the worst sort, laps up liquor like ice water and puffs on tobacco cigarettes like a chimney. If you're tired of cooking and watching men destroy the planet, "The Long Kiss Goodnight" is just the kind of rollicking nonsense to set your sights on when you're looking for something memorable with lots of audacious combat sequences. The scene where our heroine is strapped to a water wheel is terrific. Craig Bierko and David Morse make venomous villains. "The Long Kiss Goodnight" never wears out its welcome and it ranks as one of Geena Davis' best action flicks.

    I've read the reviews which panned this movie because it is unrealistic (as opposed to, say...Star Wars, the Bond franchise, the Bourne franchise, Dusk Till Dawn, Indiana Jones, Batman...you name it). I've read that there's too much action, not enough plot (but Fast and Furious number X is knocking 'em dead at the box office--and the "plot" is...?) I've read that amnesia doesn't work that way (but Bourne and Memento were okay--how about the old B&W classic Random Harvest?). Me, I never watched the thing for a lesson in abnormal psychology or traumatic amnesia, and I didn't watch Bruce Willis and Steve Buscemi fly out to an approaching asteroid to learn about space science or well drilling technology, or even Physics 101 (you want realism, the fragments would have destroyed planet Earth, The End). I've read that our or our allied governments would never stage or allow a contract false flag or large scale pre-emptive attack as portrayed by Chapter, in TLKGN (but it was okay in Three Days of the Condor, or in the Tonkin Gulf and a dozen other more recent historical actual events, for that matter). This is nonsense. Someone very high up didn't like the premise and Hollywood came down hard on Shane Black's story (perhaps because they were planning something very like that). It was action/comedy not dissimilar to the Die Hard, etc. franchise, but it was made an example of. If you want to watch a realistic documentary-style production featuring intelligence agencies, then watch The Company or a half-dozen other offerings, NOT an action/comedy romp full of explosions and some of the wittiest dialog since Gross Point Blank. I might just as well complain that documentaries and docu-dramas deserve a 1 out of 10 because they are not funny and move too slowly. I give this movie (which I and my partner own and have watched many times just for the acting and darkly comedic dialog, timing, and delivery) a 10 on it's own merits. Not because some reviewers overseas found it too "Hollywood," or some thought it appealed to 14-year-olds (like 14-year-olds shouldn't be allowed movies aimed at them), or some refused to watch it yet still felt qualified to vote and express an opinion, all the other usual suspect reasons for panning a movie and trying to sound outraged or intelligent, or whatever. Even Ebert was upset that the hero and heroine outran a fireball--see, they never put that in action/comedy movies because everyone knows it's impossible to outrun a fireball. (So what do we do, Rog, just end the movie there? They blew up, The End.) Please, reviewers, if escapist Hollywood action/comedies are not your thing, stop reviewing stuff which offends your literal sensibilities, or which you did not bother to watch. Go review Heidi, or Wuthering Heights, or A River Runs Through it. But what's the point in comparing this sort of thing to Hitchcock and Bergman all the time? This movie is older than the age-group it was written for, and still stands out as a classic of its type (which includes Die Hard and Lethal Weapon). Ten out of ten.

    Geena Davis plays Samantha Caine, an ordinary housewife who cannot remember anything further back than eight years ago. She has a daughter Caitlin (Yvonne Zima) but cannot remember who the father is. Despite the amnesia, she has built a fulfilling life with a new partner. Following a car accident, she begins to remember parts of her previous life. It's complicated. She was Charly Baltimore, an assassin working for the US government. Samuel L Jackson plays private detective Mitch Henessey who Samantha has employed to try to find out about her past. He joins Caine/Baltimore as they become one of the best double acts in the movies. Brian Cox is brilliant in his brief role as Dr Nathan Waldman, who helps her reconstruct her past and has some of the best lines. Though Jackson comes a close second. You like comedy? Some of this stuff is laugh out loud funny. You like action? This is better than Die Hard. You like tough female leads? Check out Ms Davis. Why did this film not get a stack of awards?

    "The Long Kiss GoodNight" is a film that mixes different genres aptly as action, comedy, drama and intrigue. Geena Davis plays "Samantha Caine," a teacher who has lost her memory. After hiring a private detective (Samuel L. Jackson), discover her ancient and violent life as a CIA agent. The script of the film slightly resembles the legendary saga "Bourne". In the 90s it was unusual to see a woman as the star of an action movie. At that time, the action film was exclusively dominated by men, and has a great merit that Geena Davis broke the norm with this movie, and one year earlier with "Cutthroat Island" playing the Pirate "Adams Morgan". After "The Long Kiss GoodNight" Geena Davis got consecrated as action heroine, something unthinkable at the time. And she did 40 years ago, when it was not young girl. The best of the film is the tandem Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson, who exude a good chemistry. Geena Davis was extremely sensual and attractive and did her performance in the two facets of her character, as a housewife and mother on the one hand, and as hard "spy" on the other. As Samuel L. Jackson, his character adds some touches of humor to the film that is fantastic. The script begins with a thriller that traps, but with the passage of minutes the action is completely taking over the film. In conclusion, the film is well made, it is entertaining and exciting. It's not a pretentious film in no time, and it has some scenes to remember.

    The whole time I spent watching this movie, all I could think was: such a shame. The script is tight, funny and packed with highly quotable dialogue, both Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson are giving it their all, and the production team clearly had a considerable budget to back them, but sadly it amounts to a highly anticlimactic viewing experience. The overall pacing and switching of scenes is distracting to say the least, and director Renny Harlin seems to think he can hide his lack of talent for storytelling by staging badly-cut shootouts, chases and explosions, and meanwhile overstretching unnecessary slo-mo shots. Alan Silvestri's score doesn't help much either, as it manages to sound invasive, clich&eacute;d and tired all at once. I mean: he even uses a trademark 'eighties soap saxophone' bit in a potentially great kitchen scene. Thank God they used some great classic songs to keep some kind of pace going, by the likes of Santana, Patti Labelle and, of course, Muddy Waters, whose 'Mannish Boy' is used as an inspired comedic red herring in the screenplay. But those are all sidenotes. If this script had ended up in the hands of an even slightly more original director, this could've become a cult neo-noir action classic.

    I watched this movie a couple of days ago as I have had it in my DVD collection for years. At first I thought it was a female Bourne Identity rip off and then I realised that this came first! The long Kiss Goodnight is packed with witty one liners that would make James Bond proud and it is quite chilling the idea of the West blaming others for terrorist atrocities that they have done themselves. I am talking before 9/11. The movie is smart believable great one liners and a great chemistry between Gina and Samuel. In fact I like this movie so much as soon as I finish this review I am going to watch it again. For those who compare this movie with Bourne, you have to remember that the lost memory angle and being a spy is the only similarity.

Davis acquits herself well as the super-heroine in a gender reversal of James Bond. This is the kind of free-for-all, tongue-in-cheek action epic that media watchdogs like to condemn for its cartoon violence and inappropriate behavior. When Caine becomes Charlie Baltimore, she spews profanities of the worst sort, laps up liquor like ice water and puffs on tobacco cigarettes like a chimney. If you're tired of cooking and watching men destroy the planet, "The Long Kiss Goodnight" is just the kind of rollicking nonsense to set your sights on when you're looking for something memorable with lots of audacious combat sequences. The scene where our heroine is strapped to a water wheel is terrific. Craig Bierko and David Morse make venomous villains. "The Long Kiss Goodnight" never wears out its welcome and it ranks as one of Geena Davis' best action flicks.

    I've read the reviews which panned this movie because it is unrealistic (as opposed to, say...Star Wars, the Bond franchise, the Bourne franchise, Dusk Till Dawn, Indiana Jones, Batman...you name it). I've read that there's too much action, not enough plot (but Fast and Furious number X is knocking 'em dead at the box office--and the "plot" is...?) I've read that amnesia doesn't work that way (but Bourne and Memento were okay--how about the old B&W classic Random Harvest?). Me, I never watched the thing for a lesson in abnormal psychology or traumatic amnesia, and I didn't watch Bruce Willis and Steve Buscemi fly out to an approaching asteroid to learn about space science or well drilling technology, or even Physics 101 (you want realism, the fragments would have destroyed planet Earth, The End). I've read that our or our allied governments would never stage or allow a contract false flag or large scale pre-emptive attack as portrayed by Chapter, in TLKGN (but it was okay in Three Days of the Condor, or in the Tonkin Gulf and a dozen other more recent historical actual events, for that matter). This is nonsense. Someone very high up didn't like the premise and Hollywood came down hard on Shane Black's story (perhaps because they were planning something very like that). It was action/comedy not dissimilar to the Die Hard, etc. franchise, but it was made an example of. If you want to watch a realistic documentary-style production featuring intelligence agencies, then watch The Company or a half-dozen other offerings, NOT an action/comedy romp full of explosions and some of the wittiest dialog since Gross Point Blank. I might just as well complain that documentaries and docu-dramas deserve a 1 out of 10 because they are not funny and move too slowly. I give this movie (which I and my partner own and have watched many times just for the acting and darkly comedic dialog, timing, and delivery) a 10 on it's own merits. Not because some reviewers overseas found it too "Hollywood," or some thought it appealed to 14-year-olds (like 14-year-olds shouldn't be allowed movies aimed at them), or some refused to watch it yet still felt qualified to vote and express an opinion, all the other usual suspect reasons for panning a movie and trying to sound outraged or intelligent, or whatever. Even Ebert was upset that the hero and heroine outran a fireball--see, they never put that in action/comedy movies because everyone knows it's impossible to outrun a fireball. (So what do we do, Rog, just end the movie there? They blew up, The End.) Please, reviewers, if escapist Hollywood action/comedies are not your thing, stop reviewing stuff which offends your literal sensibilities, or which you did not bother to watch. Go review Heidi, or Wuthering Heights, or A River Runs Through it. But what's the point in comparing this sort of thing to Hitchcock and Bergman all the time? This movie is older than the age-group it was written for, and still stands out as a classic of its type (which includes Die Hard and Lethal Weapon). Ten out of ten.

    Geena Davis plays Samantha Caine, an ordinary housewife who cannot remember anything further back than eight years ago. She has a daughter Caitlin (Yvonne Zima) but cannot remember who the father is. Despite the amnesia, she has built a fulfilling life with a new partner. Following a car accident, she begins to remember parts of her previous life. It's complicated. She was Charly Baltimore, an assassin working for the US government. Samuel L Jackson plays private detective Mitch Henessey who Samantha has employed to try to find out about her past. He joins Caine/Baltimore as they become one of the best double acts in the movies. Brian Cox is brilliant in his brief role as Dr Nathan Waldman, who helps her reconstruct her past and has some of the best lines. Though Jackson comes a close second. You like comedy? Some of this stuff is laugh out loud funny. You like action? This is better than Die Hard. You like tough female leads? Check out Ms Davis. Why did this film not get a stack of awards?

    "The Long Kiss GoodNight" is a film that mixes different genres aptly as action, comedy, drama and intrigue. Geena Davis plays "Samantha Caine," a teacher who has lost her memory. After hiring a private detective (Samuel L. Jackson), discover her ancient and violent life as a CIA agent. The script of the film slightly resembles the legendary saga "Bourne". In the 90s it was unusual to see a woman as the star of an action movie. At that time, the action film was exclusively dominated by men, and has a great merit that Geena Davis broke the norm with this movie, and one year earlier with "Cutthroat Island" playing the Pirate "Adams Morgan". After "The Long Kiss GoodNight" Geena Davis got consecrated as action heroine, something unthinkable at the time. And she did 40 years ago, when it was not young girl. The best of the film is the tandem Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson, who exude a good chemistry. Geena Davis was extremely sensual and attractive and did her performance in the two facets of her character, as a housewife and mother on the one hand, and as hard "spy" on the other. As Samuel L. Jackson, his character adds some touches of humor to the film that is fantastic. The script begins with a thriller that traps, but with the passage of minutes the action is completely taking over the film. In conclusion, the film is well made, it is entertaining and exciting. It's not a pretentious film in no time, and it has some scenes to remember.

    The whole time I spent watching this movie, all I could think was: such a shame. The script is tight, funny and packed with highly quotable dialogue, both Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson are giving it their all, and the production team clearly had a considerable budget to back them, but sadly it amounts to a highly anticlimactic viewing experience. The overall pacing and switching of scenes is distracting to say the least, and director Renny Harlin seems to think he can hide his lack of talent for storytelling by staging badly-cut shootouts, chases and explosions, and meanwhile overstretching unnecessary slo-mo shots. Alan Silvestri's score doesn't help much either, as it manages to sound invasive, clich&eacute;d and tired all at once. I mean: he even uses a trademark 'eighties soap saxophone' bit in a potentially great kitchen scene. Thank God they used some great classic songs to keep some kind of pace going, by the likes of Santana, Patti Labelle and, of course, Muddy Waters, whose 'Mannish Boy' is used as an inspired comedic red herring in the screenplay. But those are all sidenotes. If this script had ended up in the hands of an even slightly more original director, this could've become a cult neo-noir action classic.

    I watched this movie a couple of days ago as I have had it in my DVD collection for years. At first I thought it was a female Bourne Identity rip off and then I realised that this came first! The long Kiss Goodnight is packed with witty one liners that would make James Bond proud and it is quite chilling the idea of the West blaming others for terrorist atrocities that they have done themselves. I am talking before 9/11. The movie is smart believable great one liners and a great chemistry between Gina and Samuel. In fact I like this movie so much as soon as I finish this review I am going to watch it again. For those who compare this movie with Bourne, you have to remember that the lost memory angle and being a spy is the only similarity. Okay they are major similarities but Long kiss is light whereas Bourne is a very serious movie. Bourne works hard to make sure innocent bystanders are not caught up in the killing whereas in Long quite a few bystanders bite the dust. Any how well done Gina and well done Samuel I thoroughly enjoy this film and I am extremely happy I have it in my DVD collection.

    Back in the 1990s, I first saw The Long Kiss Goodnight. Despite the low box-office return or public appeal, I really, really enjoyed it. So, when it was presented to me on Amazon for a low, low price on BluRay, I snatched it up, even without having seen it in over 15-16 years. Am I happy about the purchase? Eh, yeah. Since it was cheap. Actually, the over-long film suffered from many problems, but overall, it was actually enjoyable. It's just hard to watch in 2013 following the excellent Bourne Trilogy. (Yeah, just parts 1-3.) You see, the concept is almost identical with the exception of swapping sexes. Here, teacher/good housewife Samantha Caine has a great life with a family, but doesn't remember her life prior to just before giving birth to her daughter and being found on a beach. She hires the best of the best private investigators to find her past and only reaches some success with the bottom of the barrel Mitch. Onlydoes she really want to find herself again? I've always loved Geena Davis, and sad she never got the superstardom as she deserved. And who doesn't, in their right mind, love Samuel L. Jackson? They both play a huge part in this movie's enjoyment. Even though it's really too long, and it's hard to hold this up in a Post-Bourne world, it's still a fun watch.

    When I first saw this movie I expected a lot and was quite disappointed with it. I was prepared to leave it behind as a dull movie, but for some reason I ended up watching it again and I enjoyed it. Having watched it a second time I came to realise that this is quite a witty and clever movie, and it seems that Harlin (who directed Die Hard II) as been influenced in a good way. Please also note that this was originally written in 1996, so some of the comments made in this review are relevant to when it was written. I simply cannot be bothered rewriting the whole thing again, and have decided to leave it as is with only a few modifications. The movie is about a lady, Samantha (Geena Davis), who woke up one day on a beach pregnant and suffering from amnesia. She became a school teacher and found a nice man and moved in with him. Eight years later a nasty criminal sees her and breaks out of gaol to get her, and a private detective (Samual L. Jackson) has found some stuff belonging to her. She also suffers concussion after a car accident and finds that she can do stuff that she couldn't do before. After digging in a little deeper she comes to realise that she used to be a government assassin and was in the middle of a job when she was shot in the head and left for dead on a beach. Things have changed in eight years though, and those that were the enemies before are now allies and are in the middle of a project to raise some funds for the organisation. When agencies talk about fund raising they talk about faking terrorist activities to tell the government that they are needed. This brings up an idea of what the cold war was all about. It was a war were intelligence operatives would live a luxurious lifestyle funded by the paranoia of a nation believing that the Red threat, if not contained, would destroy the world. This is one of the ideas behind the origins of the cold war, and this is pursued in this movie. Now that Russia has opened up, and that we know that they were never really a threat, the need for internal security has vanished. The only problems are with terrorists, and even then very few attacks seem to hit the United States. The threats do not seem to come from the outside, but rather from inside the country. The last true terrorist attack at the time of writing was the Oklahoma City bombing, and that was allegedly caused by a right winged American acting alone, though this is debatable (and when you consider the connection with Waco, it does raise the question of whether McVeigh did act alone). The Columbine massacre was not a terrorist attack as such, but it highlights the fact that threats to the social stability of America comes not from religious fanatics, but from those who are being forced by society to conform, and when they do not want to they are harassed until they lash out at the system that forced them into this situation. Obviously, things have changed a lot since this movie was released, with the September 11th terrorist attacks, but once again it goes to show how the ideas behind this movie hold true to form. The belief among many was that September 11th was pretty much what this movie was about, a set up designed to scare the American people, and congress, into providing funding for the intelligence community, and to given them further powers to intrude into people's lives. Personally, I do not think it was a set up per se, but rather a deliberate blinding to an event that could have been prevented. The idea of being asleep at the wheel is also brought up, once again to enable Congress to reinstate funding to support the intelligence community. Back to the movie. It is a great little movie. The action is good, but what gives it its edge are the characters. Samual L. Jackson is the coolest character as he is s small time detective, or more like a con- that gets caught up in something way over his head. He is a liar and a cheat, but finds himself in a problem too deep when he agrees to help Samantha. When I first saw it, I did not like it, but now I do and recommend it to anybody. Favourite Quote: that dog and my meal do not go well together. It has been licking it's butt for over three hours. Whatever it is trying to dislodge is either gone for good, of there to stay.

    I won't try to push this movie too hard but I find it nearly impossible to believe it only rates 6+ stars. I think it's too touchy-feely for your average action fan and too violent from most rom-com connoisseurs. I guess it falls into that narrow gap reserved for thrillers with snappy dialogue and just a touch of seemingly far-fetched and yet ultimately believable romance. Although I am not the kind of moviegoer who enjoys repeat viewings of a film, I have seen this movie five times over the years and it still entertains me thoroughly. Certain bits of dialogue between the two main stars are unforgettable and quotable, and while the plot may be fairly hackneyed, it contains many elements of a classic tragedy  questions of identity, revenge, uncommon heroism, and self-sacrifice  which have stood the test of time. Beyond that, it ups the ante on most action films through the brilliant comic timing of Geena Davis and Samuel Jackson, its two main leads, who are both as brutal and nonchalant with each other as a couple of teenagers. The one thing the movie clearly lacks is fancy special effects, but when a movie has great actors, great dialogue, and great fun, it hardly seems a deficiency.

    Perhaps there is spoiler here.... Everybody went wild for the Hunger Games this year, but films like Geena Davies ones, in particular this one and "Cutthroat Island", were way ahead as far as women assertiveness and freedom go. I see Geena Davies as the female Bruce Willis, she has that sardonic smile and look that make her film fun. Angeline Jolie is another of my favourite action heroins for the same reason. My favourite line in the film is when she is locked up in an industrial refrigerator at -50C and her little daughter asks her "Are we going to die mummy?" and instead of the usual dribbling series of reassurances a mum would give she says "Noo!.... they are." I also like how when she still doesn't remember who she is she switches from nice sweet little teacher to quick kick ass spy reflexes without even knowing what she is doing. In short this might not be an intellectual film but then again neither "Die hard *" are, and I find Geena Davies a quite good action actress.
