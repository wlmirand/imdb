 <sinopse>
  Two former U. S. Presidents, hated rivals, join forces to expose the current, corrupt President at the risk of their lives.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Kramer and Douglas, two former presidents from opposite ends of the political spectrum, become reluctant allies when they become the target of a conspirator in President Haney's administration. The two ex-presidents realize they have an enemy within the government and set out to find evidence that will clear their names. The search takes them across the Southern Appalachians; along the way they meet a homeless couple, thwart kidnapers in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant, and find themselves marching in a gay pride parade.

    Peter Segal's My Fellow Americans, a kind and genial little film, has coined the term "Grumpy Old Presidents' over time with good reason. Had Walter Mathau been cast in the role of Democratic Governor Matt Douglas and not James Garner, we would've been calling this "Grumpiest Old Men," as if it were a sequel to the inspired comedies Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathau made in the mid-nineties. But I digress. This is an equally inspired comedy, that knows its tone, knows its audience, and makes good use of its entire cast, especially its lead, Lemmon and Garner, who are unbelievably charismatic together as two bitter political rivals that have proudly clung to this white collar, boyhood way of fighting for decades now. Lemmon plays Republican Senator Russell Kramer and Garner is Democratic Governor Matt Douglas, who have both endured four years in office, first being Kramer defeating Douglas, and then four years later, vice-versa. Now incumbent Douglas has been defeated by former vice president William Haney (Dan Aykroyd) and his vice president Ted Matthews (John Heard). Up to speed? The last few years have been quite quiet for Kramer, who has been publishing books left and right and speaking at various schools and even for insurance companies. Douglas has endured a rougher road, working on publishing a book that is a sub-par effort according to his editor and is in the mix of a long divorce battle. On a plane to a funeral at Air Force One for a fallen Republican, the two men quibble all throughout the plane-ride and cement the fact to us why they have been bitter rivals for so many long years. When a serious scandal goes on that a man by the name of Charlie Reynolds (James Rebhorn) offered current president Haney kickbacks when he was a vice president, the Democratic Party plots to frame Kramer. But when Charlies is assassinated and Kramer and Douglas are put on a helicopter allegedly headed for Camp David under the order of Haney, but shipped into the middle of nowhere, the two cantankerous old presidents must learn to get along and attempt to stop the kickback scandal currently at hand in the White House. It's easy to say this film is never boring. What impressed me immediately was how dialog-driven and event-assisted this film became during the middle of its first act and how it never ceased to become lengthy and ponderous. The film uses its two men not as fiery weapons, but as human characters as they try in work through an incomprehensible situation paired with someone they are not fond of. The film continues to throw in different little twists, to keep its slender plot interesting, and never do they seem obligatory and forced. They are all little pieces attributing to the larger conflict at hand and all come to a close nicely. Writers E. Jack Kaplan, Richard Chapman, and Peter Tolan are too concerned with infusing satire into this material rather than have the characters remain presidential archetypes. Had they not gone for a more satirical effort, depicting corruption in the White House, brutal honest among elected officials, and widely different outlooks on both characters all attempting to cater to the same goal, this could've been a relatively strained, dull, unimportant effort. Yet largely because of the way the film injects little humorous quirks that make both Republicans and Democrats tick is the reason for My Fellow Americans' success as a film and as a whole. One could argue the film plays it too safe for a comedy directed at satirizing and lampooning American politics. I agree; the film relatively works in an inconsequential light and its prime goal isn't to offend or promote further hatred to one side or the other. But this could work in part of its success too, since we're so accustomed to each side bitterly debating with each other and the almost deliberate and apparent contention each side holds with one another that maybe a "safe" satire on politics is kind of what we need. A fun, free-spirited kind of take on the issue. It doesn't need to be completely offensive, and the film isn't always as safe as it would appear. Yet in the long run, Republicans shouldn't be too offended at the jabs at their stinginess and Democrats shouldn't be offended at the punches at their free use of money. My Fellow Americans is written efficiently and played nicely by its three writers and directed with a nice loose grip by Peter Segal, who too directed the joyously fun, quick-witted comedy that was Tommy Boy, that emphasized on the snappy worldplay that this project heavily relies on. Both films work well in the same fields, giving us two likable main characters, two talented screen-performers, an easily-digestible script, competent writing, solid direction, and overall, a cheeriness about a subject that we need and should cherish in current times. The whole exercise works on its own merits and that could be the reason you like or dislike this film as a whole. Starring: Jack Lemmon, James Garner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Heard. Directed by: Peter Segal.

    Who would of thought that two old men, well known actors Jack Lemmon and James Garner had such a sense of humor and could pull off such a funny, entertaining movie. Especially, having to play roles as two former Presidents of The U.S. Which of course, everyone thinks President's are always serious and would never say such things, like these two did. I have to admit, the beginning of the movie was quite boring and it lagged. Finally after awhile the fun begins and I could not stop laughing at these two the whole time they cracked jokes about each other. Every time something went wrong in their journey to solve the "mystery" that was going to put both of them in a dilemma,again they both could not help but to take cheap shots at each other, which were all hilarious. I was expecting Actor Dan Akroyd to be the main comedian in this movie but his part was far different from all his movies he ever acted in. That of course did not make a difference how funny this movie was. Once again, hail to the chiefs and all their funny moments throughout the movie. I definitely give this movie a 10!

    Great movie that really captured my attention. when the film started it was kind of boring, but then the action began. i liked the part where they got into the gay march.what i most liked about this movie was when they found this family at the picnic and they stole their car. the appeared as nothing happened and the family didn't do anything to stop them. After a while they knew that a baby was in the back seat and they had to go back. In the whole movie i was thinking that they couldn't get caught. there were just a few exceptions, for example the beginning, it began kind of boring, i would change and make a funny part for the beginning. it was a really good movie and i will recommend it. I'm voting 8 out of 10 because as i said, the beginning was not that good.

    This movie shows what a funny film is supposed to be like. I like this movie because of its unique way of making us laugh, their way of making the script and how everything came together to make this movie one of my favorites original films. The selection of the actors was great. Jack Lemmon play his role really well and so did James Garner. They are both great actors and they clearly show that in this movie. What I also like about the movie is that it can be a movie not only for those who like comedy but also for those who don't. This movie is really just a movie that everyone can enjoy.

    "My Fellow Americans" is not an especially deep or groundbreaking film--but it is marvelously entertaining. It's helped by very good dialog and very good acting to make what is essentially another road buddy picture stand out from the crowd. This film begins with a prologue. In this fictionalized world, the US has had two recent one-term presidents (Jack Lemmon and James Garner). Neither was especially popular and both hate each other and come from the other political party. And, now that they are no longer in office, they both feel a bit useless. However, when the rather amoral new president gets in trouble for ethics violations, he's easily convinced to simply blame it on one of his predecessors (Lemmon). But, when Garner accidentally stumbles into this, he, too, is now in trouble with the evil new president. It seems that the new president is more than happy to now set up BOTH ex-presidents--and soon Lemmon and Garner are on the run from agents who seem eager to kill them. Can they avoid these crazed agents and help expose the truth? And, can they manage to get along long enough to get this done? While this film occasionally has lapses in writing (such as the getaway on horseback and the very end of the film), much of the time the film works when neither ex-president is doing anything other than argue with each other. This makes the film seem a bit like "Grumpy Old Men"--and simply having the two fine actors gripe at each other is more than enough to provide laughs and some fine moments. By the way, if you do watch, pay attention during the horseback scene. You can notice that the faces of Garner and Lemmon was VERY clumsily pasted onto the stuntmen to make it look like they are doing the actual riding. It's amazing how much better such CGI has gotten since 1996.

    I actually enjoyed this movie quite a lot. It was fun to watch Jack Lemmon again. I completely agree with Roger Ebert when he says "''My Fellow Americans' is a series of cheap shots and missed opportunities, but a lot of the cheap shots are funny" and he describes the movie perfectly when he says "James Garner steps into the role usually played by Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon plays his usual grump, and 102 minutes of insult humor rolls painlessly past". Yes, it is a typical buddy movie and yes, we have seen it all before and yes, the screenplay is rather dumb, but nevertheless the film provides for 90 minutes of very decent entertainment. Nothing more, nothing less.

    I just finished watching this movie on Netflix and I really enjoyed. I started watching it because I thought it was a historical movie but I was wrong and I'm happy about it. First of all I know Dan Aykroyd from many movies including Driving Miss Daisy. And of course I know Jack Lemmon from Grumpy and Grumpier Old Men. I also know James Garner from The Ultimate Gift. These three are very great actors in their own way and this movie was perfect for all three. But to me it did get a little confusing right around the middle but when the ending happened it cleared it all up. I suggest if your looking for a movie to watch but don't know which, go to Netflix and watch My Fellow Americans!

    Thanks to Amazon Prime Streaming, I was able to check this movie out which I probably would never even watch on cable or rent on DVD. I saw it as a rental in the 90s and I thought it was OK then. But now, it's still funny and the politics are still funny. But don't think of this of a political movie. Think of it as a buddy movie with some political insight. James Garner and Jack Lemmon are great in this movie. I am not used to them "swearing" but they do and I can't help but laugh. You could call this Grumpier Old Men Go To Washington. It's funny to see how life might be like living as an ex-president. The movie was entertaining from start to finish.

    This is actually a fairly good comedy. Great cast too! The political satire is quite good. My only complaint is: Why is this movie not available in widescreen? When it played it theaters it was almost certainly at least 1:85.1 if not not 2:35.1 format. Come on Warner Brothers, please make this movie available in widescreen, or better yet, widescreen Blu Ray. This says that my review must have TEN LINES! I've already said what I needed to say, why is it necessary to write a minimum of ten lines when what I wanted to say can be said in about half of that? This seems to FORCE reviewers to be much more wordy than necessary. Be sure to watch the "bloopers" in the special features, they are hilarious. Jack Lemmon could NOT stop laughing! Still not enough? Okay, to summarize: good movie, under-rated. Should be available in widescreen though. Blu Ray widescreen would be best.

    Political comedies can be notoriously difficult to comprehend and/or stomach at the best of times, but this is a gem. Lemmon and Garner play it strictly for laughs, and hit the target on almost every occasion. The script may not be particularly subtle, and there is a propensity for cheap laughs with mildly foul language (save one utterance of an F word) - but there are some big big belly laughs to be had, not just in the witty script but also some nicely staged slapstick moments. A woeful bit of CGI when our two heroes are supposed to be on horseback is the only black mark against the production values - the pace is slick, the writing witty and inventive, the punchlines come thick and fast - and there's hardly a moment that comes anywhere near giving you 'the red ass'! Rent/buy and enjoy!

I've already said what I needed to say, why is it necessary to write a minimum of ten lines when what I wanted to say can be said in about half of that? This seems to FORCE reviewers to be much more wordy than necessary. Be sure to watch the "bloopers" in the special features, they are hilarious. Jack Lemmon could NOT stop laughing! Still not enough? Okay, to summarize: good movie, under-rated. Should be available in widescreen though. Blu Ray widescreen would be best.

    Political comedies can be notoriously difficult to comprehend and/or stomach at the best of times, but this is a gem. Lemmon and Garner play it strictly for laughs, and hit the target on almost every occasion. The script may not be particularly subtle, and there is a propensity for cheap laughs with mildly foul language (save one utterance of an F word) - but there are some big big belly laughs to be had, not just in the witty script but also some nicely staged slapstick moments. A woeful bit of CGI when our two heroes are supposed to be on horseback is the only black mark against the production values - the pace is slick, the writing witty and inventive, the punchlines come thick and fast - and there's hardly a moment that comes anywhere near giving you 'the red ass'! Rent/buy and enjoy!

    Peter Segal's My Fellow Americans, a kind and genial little film, has coined the term "Grumpy Old Presidents' over time with good reason. Had Walter Mathau been cast in the role of Democratic Governor Matt Douglas and not James Garner, we would've been calling this "Grumpiest Old Men," as if it were a sequel to the inspired comedies Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathau made in the mid-nineties. But I digress. This is an equally inspired comedy, that knows its tone, knows its audience, and makes good use of its entire cast, especially its lead, Lemmon and Garner, who are unbelievably charismatic together as two bitter political rivals that have proudly clung to this white collar, boyhood way of fighting for decades now. Lemmon plays Republican Senator Russell Kramer and Garner is Democratic Governor Matt Douglas, who have both endured four years in office, first being Kramer defeating Douglas, and then four years later, vice-versa. Now incumbent Douglas has been defeated by former vice president William Haney (Dan Aykroyd) and his vice president Ted Matthews (John Heard). Up to speed? The last few years have been quite quiet for Kramer, who has been publishing books left and right and speaking at various schools and even for insurance companies. Douglas has endured a rougher road, working on publishing a book that is a sub-par effort according to his editor and is in the mix of a long divorce battle. On a plane to a funeral at Air Force One for a fallen Republican, the two men quibble all throughout the plane-ride and cement the fact to us why they have been bitter rivals for so many long years. When a serious scandal goes on that a man by the name of Charlie Reynolds (James Rebhorn) offered current president Haney kickbacks when he was a vice president, the Democratic Party plots to frame Kramer. But when Charlies is assassinated and Kramer and Douglas are put on a helicopter allegedly headed for Camp David under the order of Haney, but shipped into the middle of nowhere, the two cantankerous old presidents must learn to get along and attempt to stop the kickback scandal currently at hand in the White House. It's easy to say this film is never boring. What impressed me immediately was how dialog-driven and event-assisted this film became during the middle of its first act and how it never ceased to become lengthy and ponderous. The film uses its two men not as fiery weapons, but as human characters as they try in work through an incomprehensible situation paired with someone they are not fond of. The film continues to throw in different little twists, to keep its slender plot interesting, and never do they seem obligatory and forced. They are all little pieces attributing to the larger conflict at hand and all come to a close nicely. Writers E. Jack Kaplan, Richard Chapman, and Peter Tolan are too concerned with infusing satire into this material rather than have the characters remain presidential archetypes. Had they not gone for a more satirical effort, depicting corruption in the White House, brutal honest among elected officials, and widely different outlooks on both characters all attempting to cater to the same goal, this could've been a relatively strained, dull, unimportant effort. Yet largely because of the way the film injects little humorous quirks that make both Republicans and Democrats tick is the reason for My Fellow Americans' success as a film and as a whole. One could argue the film plays it too safe for a comedy directed at satirizing and lampooning American politics. I agree; the film relatively works in an inconsequential light and its prime goal isn't to offend or promote further hatred to one side or the other. But this could work in part of its success too, since we're so accustomed to each side bitterly debating with each other and the almost deliberate and apparent contention each side holds with one another that maybe a "safe" satire on politics is kind of what we need. A fun, free-spirited kind of take on the issue. It doesn't need to be completely offensive, and the film isn't always as safe as it would appear. Yet in the long run, Republicans shouldn't be too offended at the jabs at their stinginess and Democrats shouldn't be offended at the punches at their free use of money. My Fellow Americans is written efficiently and played nicely by its three writers and directed with a nice loose grip by Peter Segal, who too directed the joyously fun, quick-witted comedy that was Tommy Boy, that emphasized on the snappy worldplay that this project heavily relies on. Both films work well in the same fields, giving us two likable main characters, two talented screen-performers, an easily-digestible script, competent writing, solid direction, and overall, a cheeriness about a subject that we need and should cherish in current times. The whole exercise works on its own merits and that could be the reason you like or dislike this film as a whole. Starring: Jack Lemmon, James Garner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Heard. Directed by: Peter Segal.

    Who would of thought that two old men, well known actors Jack Lemmon and James Garner had such a sense of humor and could pull off such a funny, entertaining movie. Especially, having to play roles as two former Presidents of The U.S. Which of course, everyone thinks President's are always serious and would never say such things, like these two did. I have to admit, the beginning of the movie was quite boring and it lagged. Finally after awhile the fun begins and I could not stop laughing at these two the whole time they cracked jokes about each other. Every time something went wrong in their journey to solve the "mystery" that was going to put both of them in a dilemma,again they both could not help but to take cheap shots at each other, which were all hilarious. I was expecting Actor Dan Akroyd to be the main comedian in this movie but his part was far different from all his movies he ever acted in. That of course did not make a difference how funny this movie was. Once again, hail to the chiefs and all their funny moments throughout the movie. I definitely give this movie a 10!

    Great movie that really captured my attention. when the film started it was kind of boring, but then the action began. i liked the part where they got into the gay march.what i most liked about this movie was when they found this family at the picnic and they stole their car. the appeared as nothing happened and the family didn't do anything to stop them. After a while they knew that a baby was in the back seat and they had to go back. In the whole movie i was thinking that they couldn't get caught. there were just a few exceptions, for example the beginning, it began kind of boring, i would change and make a funny part for the beginning. it was a really good movie and i will recommend it. I'm voting 8 out of 10 because as i said, the beginning was not that good.

    This movie shows what a funny film is supposed to be like. I like this movie because of its unique way of making us laugh, their way of making the script and how everything came together to make this movie one of my favorites original films. The selection of the actors was great. Jack Lemmon play his role really well and so did James Garner. They are both great actors and they clearly show that in this movie. What I also like about the movie is that it can be a movie not only for those who like comedy but also for those who don't. This movie is really just a movie that everyone can enjoy.

    "My Fellow Americans" is not an especially deep or groundbreaking film--but it is marvelously entertaining. It's helped by very good dialog and very good acting to make what is essentially another road buddy picture stand out from the crowd. This film begins with a prologue. In this fictionalized world, the US has had two recent one-term presidents (Jack Lemmon and James Garner). Neither was especially popular and both hate each other and come from the other political party. And, now that they are no longer in office, they both feel a bit useless. However, when the rather amoral new president gets in trouble for ethics violations, he's easily convinced to simply blame it on one of his predecessors (Lemmon). But, when Garner accidentally stumbles into this, he, too, is now in trouble with the evil new president. It seems that the new president is more than happy to now set up BOTH ex-presidents--and soon Lemmon and Garner are on the run from agents who seem eager to kill them. Can they avoid these crazed agents and help expose the truth? And, can they manage to get along long enough to get this done? While this film occasionally has lapses in writing (such as the getaway on horseback and the very end of the film), much of the time the film works when neither ex-president is doing anything other than argue with each other. This makes the film seem a bit like "Grumpy Old Men"--and simply having the two fine actors gripe at each other is more than enough to provide laughs and some fine moments. By the way, if you do watch, pay attention during the horseback scene. You can notice that the faces of Garner and Lemmon was VERY clumsily pasted onto the stuntmen to make it look like they are doing the actual riding. It's amazing how much better such CGI has gotten since 1996.

    I actually enjoyed this movie quite a lot. It was fun to watch Jack Lemmon again. I completely agree with Roger Ebert when he says "''My Fellow Americans' is a series of cheap shots and missed opportunities, but a lot of the cheap shots are funny" and he describes the movie perfectly when he says "James Garner steps into the role usually played by Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon plays his usual grump, and 102 minutes of insult humor rolls painlessly past". Yes, it is a typical buddy movie and yes, we have seen it all before and yes, the screenplay is rather dumb, but nevertheless the film provides for 90 minutes of very decent entertainment. Nothing more, nothing less.

    I just finished watching this movie on Netflix and I really enjoyed. I started watching it because I thought it was a historical movie but I was wrong and I'm happy about it. First of all I know Dan Aykroyd from many movies including Driving Miss Daisy. And of course I know Jack Lemmon from Grumpy and Grumpier Old Men. I also know James Garner from The Ultimate Gift. These three are very great actors in their own way and this movie was perfect for all three. But to me it did get a little confusing right around the middle but when the ending happened it cleared it all up. I suggest if your looking for a movie to watch but don't know which, go to Netflix and watch My Fellow Americans!

    Thanks to Amazon Prime Streaming, I was able to check this movie out which I probably would never even watch on cable or rent on DVD. I saw it as a rental in the 90s and I thought it was OK then. But now, it's still funny and the politics are still funny. But don't think of this of a political movie. Think of it as a buddy movie with some political insight. James Garner and Jack Lemmon are great in this movie. I am not used to them "swearing" but they do and I can't help but laugh. You could call this Grumpier Old Men Go To Washington. It's funny to see how life might be like living as an ex-president. The movie was entertaining from start to finish.

    Political comedies can be notoriously difficult to comprehend and/or stomach at the best of times, but this is a gem. Lemmon and Garner play it strictly for laughs, and hit the target on almost every occasion. The script may not be particularly subtle, and there is a propensity for cheap laughs with mildly foul language (save one utterance of an F word) - but there are some big big belly laughs to be had, not just in the witty script but also some nicely staged slapstick moments. A woeful bit of CGI when our two heroes are supposed to be on horseback is the only black mark against the production values - the pace is slick, the writing witty and inventive, the punchlines come thick and fast - and there's hardly a moment that comes anywhere near giving you 'the red ass'! Rent/buy and enjoy!

    Peter Segal's My Fellow Americans, a kind and genial little film, has coined the term "Grumpy Old Presidents' over time with good reason. Had Walter Mathau been cast in the role of Democratic Governor Matt Douglas and not James Garner, we would've been calling this "Grumpiest Old Men," as if it were a sequel to the inspired comedies Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathau made in the mid-nineties. But I digress. This is an equally inspired comedy, that knows its tone, knows its audience, and makes good use of its entire cast, especially its lead, Lemmon and Garner, who are unbelievably charismatic together as two bitter political rivals that have proudly clung to this white collar, boyhood way of fighting for decades now. Lemmon plays Republican Senator Russell Kramer and Garner is Democratic Governor Matt Douglas, who have both endured four years in office, first being Kramer defeating Douglas, and then four years later, vice-versa. Now incumbent Douglas has been defeated by former vice president William Haney (Dan Aykroyd) and his vice president Ted Matthews (John Heard). Up to speed? The last few years have been quite quiet for Kramer, who has been publishing books left and right and speaking at various schools and even for insurance companies. Douglas has endured a rougher road, working on publishing a book that is a sub-par effort according to his editor and is in the mix of a long divorce battle. On a plane to a funeral at Air Force One for a fallen Republican, the two men quibble all throughout the plane-ride and cement the fact to us why they have been bitter rivals for so many long years. When a serious scandal goes on that a man by the name of Charlie Reynolds (James Rebhorn) offered current president Haney kickbacks when he was a vice president, the Democratic Party plots to frame Kramer. But when Charlies is assassinated and Kramer and Douglas are put on a helicopter allegedly headed for Camp David under the order of Haney, but shipped into the middle of nowhere, the two cantankerous old presidents must learn to get along and attempt to stop the kickback scandal currently at hand in the White House. It's easy to say this film is never boring. What impressed me immediately was how dialog-driven and event-assisted this film became during the middle of its first act and how it never ceased to become lengthy and ponderous. The film uses its two men not as fiery weapons, but as human characters as they try in work through an incomprehensible situation paired with someone they are not fond of. The film continues to throw in different little twists, to keep its slender plot interesting, and never do they seem obligatory and forced. They are all little pieces attributing to the larger conflict at hand and all come to a close nicely. Writers E. Jack Kaplan, Richard Chapman, and Peter Tolan are too concerned with infusing satire into this material rather than have the characters remain presidential archetypes. Had they not gone for a more satirical effort, depicting corruption in the White House, brutal honest among elected officials, and widely different outlooks on both characters all attempting to cater to the same goal, this could've been a relatively strained, dull, unimportant effort. Yet largely because of the way the film injects little humorous quirks that make both Republicans and Democrats tick is the reason for My Fellow Americans' success as a film and as a whole. One could argue the film plays it too safe for a comedy directed at satirizing and lampooning American politics. I agree; the film relatively works in an inconsequential light and its prime goal isn't to offend or promote further hatred to one side or the other. But this could work in part of its success too, since we're so accustomed to each side bitterly debating with each other and the almost deliberate and apparent contention each side holds with one another that maybe a "safe" satire on politics is kind of what we need. A fun, free-spirited kind of take on the issue. It doesn't need to be completely offensive, and the film isn't always as safe as it would appear. Yet in the long run, Republicans shouldn't be too offended at the jabs at their stinginess and Democrats shouldn't be offended at the punches at their free use of money. My Fellow Americans is written efficiently and played nicely by its three writers and directed with a nice loose grip by Peter Segal, who too directed the joyously fun, quick-witted comedy that was Tommy Boy, that emphasized on the snappy worldplay that this project heavily relies on. Both films work well in the same fields, giving us two likable main characters, two talented screen-performers, an easily-digestible script, competent writing, solid direction, and overall, a cheeriness about a subject that we need and should cherish in current times. The whole exercise works on its own merits and that could be the reason you like or dislike this film as a whole. Starring: Jack Lemmon, James Garner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Heard. Directed by: Peter Segal.

    Who would of thought that two old men, well known actors Jack Lemmon and James Garner had such a sense of humor and could pull off such a funny, entertaining movie. Especially, having to play roles as two former Presidents of The U.S. Which of course, everyone thinks President's are always serious and would never say such things, like these two did. I have to admit, the beginning of the movie was quite boring and it lagged. Finally after awhile the fun begins and I could not stop laughing at these two the whole time they cracked jokes about each other. Every time something went wrong in their journey to solve the "mystery" that was going to put both of them in a dilemma,again they both could not help but to take cheap shots at each other, which were all hilarious. I was expecting Actor Dan Akroyd to be the main comedian in this movie but his part was far different from all his movies he ever acted in. That of course did not make a difference how funny this movie was. Once again, hail to the chiefs and all their funny moments throughout the movie. I definitely give this movie a 10!

    Great movie that really captured my attention. when the film started it was kind of boring, but then the action began. i liked the part where they got into the gay march.what i most liked about this movie was when they found this family at the picnic and they stole their car. the appeared as nothing happened and the family didn't do anything to stop them. After a while they knew that a baby was in the back seat and they had to go back. In the whole movie i was thinking that they couldn't get caught. there were just a few exceptions, for example the beginning, it began kind of boring, i would change and make a funny part for the beginning. it was a really good movie and i will recommend it. I'm voting 8 out of 10 because as i said, the beginning was not that good.

    This movie shows what a funny film is supposed to be like. I like this movie because of its unique way of making us laugh, their way of making the script and how everything came together to make this movie one of my favorites original films. The selection of the actors was great. Jack Lemmon play his role really well and so did James Garner. They are both great actors and they clearly show that in this movie. What I also like about the movie is that it can be a movie not only for those who like comedy but also for those who don't. This movie is really just a movie that everyone can enjoy.

    "My Fellow Americans" is not an especially deep or groundbreaking film--but it is marvelously entertaining. It's helped by very good dialog and very good acting to make what is essentially another road buddy picture stand out from the crowd. This film begins with a prologue. In this fictionalized world, the US has had two recent one-term presidents (Jack Lemmon and James Garner). Neither was especially popular and both hate each other and come from the other political party. And, now that they are no longer in office, they both feel a bit useless. However, when the rather amoral new president gets in trouble for ethics violations, he's easily convinced to simply blame it on one of his predecessors (Lemmon). But, when Garner accidentally stumbles into this, he, too, is now in trouble with the evil new president. It seems that the new president is more than happy to now set up BOTH ex-presidents--and soon Lemmon and Garner are on the run from agents who seem eager to kill them. Can they avoid these crazed agents and help expose the truth? And, can they manage to get along long enough to get this done? While this film occasionally has lapses in writing (such as the getaway on horseback and the very end of the film), much of the time the film works when neither ex-president is doing anything other than argue with each other. This makes the film seem a bit like "Grumpy Old Men"--and simply having the two fine actors gripe at each other is more than enough to provide laughs and some fine moments. By the way, if you do watch, pay attention during the horseback scene. You can notice that the faces of Garner and Lemmon was VERY clumsily pasted onto the stuntmen to make it look like they are doing the actual riding. It's amazing how much better such CGI has gotten since 1996.

    I actually enjoyed this movie quite a lot. It was fun to watch Jack Lemmon again. I completely agree with Roger Ebert when he says "''My Fellow Americans' is a series of cheap shots and missed opportunities, but a lot of the cheap shots are funny" and he describes the movie perfectly when he says "James Garner steps into the role usually played by Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon plays his usual grump, and 102 minutes of insult humor rolls painlessly past". Yes, it is a typical buddy movie and yes, we have seen it all before and yes, the screenplay is rather dumb, but nevertheless the film provides for 90 minutes of very decent entertainment. Nothing more, nothing less.

    I just finished watching this movie on Netflix and I really enjoyed. I started watching it because I thought it was a historical movie but I was wrong and I'm happy about it. First of all I know Dan Aykroyd from many movies including Driving Miss Daisy. And of course I know Jack Lemmon from Grumpy and Grumpier Old Men. I also know James Garner from The Ultimate Gift. These three are very great actors in their own way and this movie was perfect for all three. But to me it did get a little confusing right around the middle but when the ending happened it cleared it all up. I suggest if your looking for a movie to watch but don't know which, go to Netflix and watch My Fellow Americans!

    Thanks to Amazon Prime Streaming, I was able to check this movie out which I probably would never even watch on cable or rent on DVD. I saw it as a rental in the 90s and I thought it was OK then. But now, it's still funny and the politics are still funny. But don't think of this of a political movie. Think of it as a buddy movie with some political insight. James Garner and Jack Lemmon are great in this movie. I am not used to them "swearing" but they do and I can't help but laugh. You could call this Grumpier Old Men Go To Washington. It's funny to see how life might be like living as an ex-president. The movie was entertaining from start to finish.

    This is actually a fairly good comedy. Great cast too! The political satire is quite good. My only complaint is: Why is this movie not available in widescreen? When it played it theaters it was almost certainly at least 1:85.1 if not not 2:35.1 format. Come on Warner Brothers, please make this movie available in widescreen, or better yet, widescreen Blu Ray. This says that my review must have TEN LINES! I've already said what I needed to say, why is it necessary to write a minimum of ten lines when what I wanted to say can be said in about half of that? This seems to FORCE reviewers to be much more wordy than necessary. Be sure to watch the "bloopers" in the special features, they are hilarious. Jack Lemmon could NOT stop laughing! Still not enough? Okay, to summarize: good movie, under-rated. Should be available in widescreen though. Blu Ray widescreen would be best.

    Political comedies can be notoriously difficult to comprehend and/or stomach at the best of times, but this is a gem. Lemmon and Garner play it strictly for laughs, and hit the target on almost every occasion. The script may not be particularly subtle, and there is a propensity for cheap laughs with mildly foul language (save one utterance of an F word) - but there are some big big belly laughs to be had, not just in the witty script but also some nicely staged slapstick moments. A woeful bit of CGI when our two heroes are supposed to be on horseback is the only black mark against the production values - the pace is slick, the writing witty and inventive, the punchlines come thick and fast - and there's hardly a moment that comes anywhere near giving you 'the red ass'! Rent/buy and enjoy!

    Peter Segal's My Fellow Americans, a kind and genial little film, has coined the term "Grumpy Old Presidents' over time with good reason. Had Walter Mathau been cast in the role of Democratic Governor Matt Douglas and not James Garner, we would've been calling this "Grumpiest Old Men," as if it were a sequel to the inspired comedies Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathau made in the mid-nineties. But I digress. This is an equally inspired comedy, that knows its tone, knows its audience, and makes good use of its entire cast, especially its lead, Lemmon and Garner, who are unbelievably charismatic together as two bitter political rivals that have proudly clung to this white collar, boyhood way of fighting for decades now. Lemmon plays Republican Senator Russell Kramer and Garner is Democratic Governor Matt Douglas, who have both endured four years in office, first being Kramer defeating Douglas, and then four years later, vice-versa. Now incumbent Douglas has been defeated by former vice president William Haney (Dan Aykroyd) and his vice president Ted Matthews (John Heard). Up to speed? The last few years have been quite quiet for Kramer, who has been publishing books left and right and speaking at various schools and even for insurance companies. Douglas has endured a rougher road, working on publishing a book that is a sub-par effort according to his editor and is in the mix of a long divorce battle. On a plane to a funeral at Air Force One for a fallen Republican, the two men quibble all throughout the plane-ride and cement the fact to us why they have been bitter rivals for so many long years. When a serious scandal goes on that a man by the name of Charlie Reynolds (James Rebhorn) offered current president Haney kickbacks when he was a vice president, the Democratic Party plots to frame Kramer. But when Charlies is assassinated and Kramer and Douglas are put on a helicopter allegedly headed for Camp David under the order of Haney, but shipped into the middle of nowhere, the two cantankerous old presidents must learn to get along and attempt to stop the kickback scandal currently at hand in the White House. It's easy to say this film is never boring. What impressed me immediately was how dialog-driven and event-assisted this film became during the middle of its first act and how it never ceased to become lengthy and ponderous. The film uses its two men not as fiery weapons, but as human characters as they try in work through an incomprehensible situation paired with someone they are not fond of. The film continues to throw in different little twists, to keep its slender plot interesting, and never do they seem obligatory and forced. They are all little pieces attributing to the larger conflict at hand and all come to a close nicely. Writers E. Jack Kaplan, Richard Chapman, and Peter Tolan are too concerned with infusing satire into this material rather than have the characters remain presidential archetypes. Had they not gone for a more satirical effort, depicting corruption in the White House, brutal honest among elected officials, and widely different outlooks on both characters all attempting to cater to the same goal, this could've been a relatively strained, dull, unimportant effort. Yet largely because of the way the film injects little humorous quirks that make both Republicans and Democrats tick is the reason for My Fellow Americans' success as a film and as a whole. One could argue the film plays it too safe for a comedy directed at satirizing and lampooning American politics. I agree; the film relatively works in an inconsequential light and its prime goal isn't to offend or promote further hatred to one side or the other. But this could work in part of its success too, since we're so accustomed to each side bitterly debating with each other and the almost deliberate and apparent contention each side holds with one another that maybe a "safe" satire on politics is kind of what we need. A fun, free-spirited kind of take on the issue. It doesn't need to be completely offensive, and the film isn't always as safe as it would appear. Yet in the long run, Republicans shouldn't be too offended at the jabs at their stinginess and Democrats shouldn't be offended at the punches at their free use of money. My Fellow Americans is written efficiently and played nicely by its three writers and directed with a nice loose grip by Peter Segal, who too directed the joyously fun, quick-witted comedy that was Tommy Boy, that emphasized on the snappy worldplay that this project heavily relies on. Both films work well in the same fields, giving us two likable main characters, two talented screen-performers, an easily-digestible script, competent writing, solid direction, and overall, a cheeriness about a subject that we need and should cherish in current times. The whole exercise works on its own merits and that could be the reason you like or dislike this film as a whole. Starring: Jack Lemmon, James Garner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Heard. Directed by: Peter Segal.

    Who would of thought that two old men, well known actors Jack Lemmon and James Garner had such a sense of humor and could pull off such a funny, entertaining movie. Especially, having to play roles as two former Presidents of The U.S. Which of course, everyone thinks President's are always serious and would never say such things, like these two did. I have to admit, the beginning of the movie was quite boring and it lagged. Finally after awhile the fun begins and I could not stop laughing at these two the whole time they cracked jokes about each other. Every time something went wrong in their journey to solve the "mystery" that was going to put both of them in a dilemma,again they both could not help but to take cheap shots at each other, which were all hilarious. I was expecting Actor Dan Akroyd to be the main comedian in this movie but his part was far different from all his movies he ever acted in. That of course did not make a difference how funny this movie was. Once again, hail to the chiefs and all their funny moments throughout the movie. I definitely give this movie a 10!

    Great movie that really captured my attention. when the film started it was kind of boring, but then the action began. i liked the part where they got into the gay march.what i most liked about this movie was when they found this family at the picnic and they stole their car. the appeared as nothing happened and the family didn't do anything to stop them. After a while they knew that a baby was in the back seat and they had to go back. In the whole movie i was thinking that they couldn't get caught. there were just a few exceptions, for example the beginning, it began kind of boring, i would change and make a funny part for the beginning. it was a really good movie and i will recommend it. I'm voting 8 out of 10 because as i said, the beginning was not that good.

    This movie shows what a funny film is supposed to be like. I like this movie because of its unique way of making us laugh, their way of making the script and how everything came together to make this movie one of my favorites original films. The selection of the actors was great. Jack Lemmon play his role really well and so did James Garner. They are both great actors and they clearly show that in this movie. What I also like about the movie is that it can be a movie not only for those who like comedy but also for those who don't. This movie is really just a movie that everyone can enjoy.

    "My Fellow Americans" is not an especially deep or groundbreaking film--but it is marvelously entertaining. It's helped by very good dialog and very good acting to make what is essentially another road buddy picture stand out from the crowd. This film begins with a prologue. In this fictionalized world, the US has had two recent one-term presidents (Jack Lemmon and James Garner). Neither was especially popular and both hate each other and come from the other political party. And, now that they are no longer in office, they both feel a bit useless. However, when the rather amoral new president gets in trouble for ethics violations, he's easily convinced to simply blame it on one of his predecessors (Lemmon). But, when Garner accidentally stumbles into this, he, too, is now in trouble with the evil new president. It seems that the new president is more than happy to now set up BOTH ex-presidents--and soon Lemmon and Garner are on the run from agents who seem eager to kill them. Can they avoid these crazed agents and help expose the truth? And, can they manage to get along long enough to get this done? While this film occasionally has lapses in writing (such as the getaway on horseback and the very end of the film), much of the time the film works when neither ex-president is doing anything other than argue with each other. This makes the film seem a bit like "Grumpy Old Men"--and simply having the two fine actors gripe at each other is more than enough to provide laughs and some fine moments. By the way, if you do watch, pay attention during the horseback scene. You can notice that the faces of Garner and Lemmon was VERY clumsily pasted onto the stuntmen to make it look like they are doing the actual riding. It's amazing how much better such CGI has gotten since 1996.

    I actually enjoyed this movie quite a lot. It was fun to watch Jack Lemmon again. I completely agree with Roger Ebert when he says "''My Fellow Americans' is a series of cheap shots and missed opportunities, but a lot of the cheap shots are funny" and he describes the movie perfectly when he says "James Garner steps into the role usually played by Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon plays his usual grump, and 102 minutes of insult humor rolls painlessly past". Yes, it is a typical buddy movie and yes, we have seen it all before and yes, the screenplay is rather dumb, but nevertheless the film provides for 90 minutes of very decent entertainment. Nothing more, nothing less.

    I just finished watching this movie on Netflix and I really enjoyed. I started watching it because I thought it was a historical movie but I was wrong and I'm happy about it. First of all I know Dan Aykroyd from many movies including Driving Miss Daisy. And of course I know Jack Lemmon from Grumpy and Grumpier Old Men. I also know James Garner from The Ultimate Gift. These three are very great actors in their own way and this movie was perfect for all three. But to me it did get a little confusing right around the middle but when the ending happened it cleared it all up. I suggest if your looking for a movie to watch but don't know which, go to Netflix and watch My Fellow Americans!

    Thanks to Amazon Prime Streaming, I was able to check this movie out which I probably would never even watch on cable or rent on DVD. I saw it as a rental in the 90s and I thought it was OK then. But now, it's still funny and the politics are still funny. But don't think of this of a political movie. Think of it as a buddy movie with some political insight. James Garner and Jack Lemmon are great in this movie. I am not used to them "swearing" but they do and I can't help but laugh. You could call this Grumpier Old Men Go To Washington. It's funny to see how life might be like living as an ex-president. The movie was entertaining from start to finish.

    This is actually a fairly good comedy. Great cast too! The political satire is quite good. My only complaint is: Why is this movie not available in widescreen? When it played it theaters it was almost certainly at least 1:85.1 if not not 2:35.1 format. Come on Warner Brothers, please make this movie available in widescreen, or better yet, widescreen Blu Ray. This says that my review must have TEN LINES! I've already said what I needed to say, why is it necessary to write a minimum of ten lines when what I wanted to say can be said in about half of that? This seems to FORCE reviewers to be much more wordy than necessary. Be sure to watch the "bloopers" in the special features, they are hilarious. Jack Lemmon could NOT stop laughing! Still not enough? Okay, to summarize: good movie, under-rated. Should be available in widescreen though. Blu Ray widescreen would be best.
