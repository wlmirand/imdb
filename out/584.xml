    The Secret Garden has been adapted many times, but perhaps none so beautifully as this 1993 adaptation, which evokes both the tenderness and haunting beauty of Francis Hodgson Burnett's classic novel (which is one of the finest children's books of all time). The story of Mary Lennox and how her transformation of an abandoned garden at her uncle's Yorkshire manor changes the lives of all around her is lovingly portrayed, with brilliant direction from Polish director Agnieszka Holland, a wonderfully ethereal score by Zbigniew Preisner, and a marvelous cast that seems to come straight out of the pages of the book. Kate Maberly is perfect as the cold, sour little Mary who blossoms inside just like her garden, and there is more fine youthful casting in Heydon Prowse as the spoiled, fragile Colin, Andrew Knott as the gentle-natured Dickon, and Laura Crossley as sweet, talkative Martha. Maggie Smith is fantastic as usual as the stern Mrs. Medlock, and John Lynch gives a haunting performance as the nerve-shattered Lord Craven. It is rare to find family entertainment that is clean, well-scripted, and visually stunning, but this movie fits the bill perfectly. It is a timeless movie that captures the spirit and quality of the timeless story it is adapted from!

    I. Love. this. movie. This is my favorite production of the Secret Garden that I have seen. The acting is superb and the scenery and soundtrack are amazing. The music is haunting and beautiful, I honestly cannot praise it enough. This movie deviates from the book somewhat, but truthfully I think that I like the movie better. I really enjoyed Kate Maberly's portrayal of Mary, she was the perfect combination of charming and sullen. In the book I found Mary very unlikeable throughout, but in this movie Kate was able to make her rude and spoiled (of course she would be with her upbringing)but also she made you have sympathy for Mary, and even like her as she grew as a character and became less irritating. Of course I love that Maggie Smith is in this (how can you not love her?) even if she is the "bad guy". Overall, this movie makes me want to watch it again and again. I loved it as a child, and enjoy it as an adult. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.

    This is my all time favourite film. I used to watch it as a child whenever it was on TV. I loved it. Then about two years ago I bought it on DVD. I've watched it loads of times and I honestly never get bored of it. It's such a beautiful film that it has me crying at the end of it every time I watch it. It has the line "You brought us back to life, Mary. You did something I thought no one could do." which just gets me welling up. Its the one film I can't bring myself to fault. Yes its dated and possibly some errors but it's wonderful. The scenery is beautiful. the story is heartwarming, the acting is brilliant (it's got Maggie Smith in for God's sake!), the characters are different and it just one of those films that everyone can watch and enjoy. I think I've said enough :) Enjoy watching :D

    The 1993 adaptation of The Secret Garden is one of two major adaptations of novels by Frances Hodgson Burnett. The Secret Garden sees Mary Lenox (Kate Maberly), a 10-year-old British girl who was born in India. She is a spoiled brat who has her own personal servant, but is emotionally distance because she was neglected by her parents. But after a massive Earthquake in India, Mary is orphan and sent back to England to live with her uncle. The Northern English manor is run by a harsh matriarch, Mrs Medlock (Maggie Smith) and limits Mary's access to most of the house. But Mary forms friendships with the servant girl Martha (Laura Crossley) and her brother Dickon (Andrew Knott) who has great animal taming abilities, discovers her aunt's secret garden and finds her 'sick' cousin Colin (Heydon Prowse). The Secret Garden does share similarities to A Little Princess, both feature young girls who grew up in India, have lost their parents in some form, both are forced to go to move to a foreign land, have to deal with an authoritarian figure, befriends a servant girl and there is a character who has a magical element to him. But there are differences as well: the main one being the central characters: Mary is a more selfish, spoiled character who has to learn to open up, show emotions, be kind and help her people whilst Sara in A Little Princess has to keep her imagination and kind spirit despite the hardships and lost she suffered. The actual story and setting for both stories is also different with Mary having to help to her cousin, lead to have a passion and learn about her family's past. In comparison to A Little Princess the direction is more sombre and bleaker tone. Director Agnieszka Holland shot the film using a grey fillers and added with the mostly winter setting and barren landscape of the moors gave the film a drowsier feel. Comedy, fantasy and whimsy is toned down and The Secret Garden is a much more grounded and serious film until the end. But it is a delightful family film for all ages and genders. As well as the Earthy look Holland brought there is also some fantastic music from Zbigniew Presiner: perfectly fitting for the film throughout. Those I am a sucker for choir music. The cast is great throughout the filmmakers did find some very talented young actors who gave very convincing performances. Many of them have gone on to have fairly successful careers beyond the film and brought out the interesting aspects from their characters. I personally thought Maberly was actually a better actress then Eleanor Bron was in A Little Princess and she did give a very emotional performance in that film. Smith is also a very formable present, as she is always is, and have very strange motivations to why she is treating Colin the way she does? Is it out of crudity, love or protection? It is up to the audience. The Secret Garden is a very good and strong family film that is serious minded and old-fashioned, but in a good away. I personally preferred The Secret Garden to A Little Princess and I speak as a fan of Alfonso Cuaron.

    And just overall well constructed. Yet another magnificent Coppola production from the halls of creativity itself. Agnieszka Holland constructs for the viewer a visual and palpable visual story that takes no prisoners. Set in Victorian England, where social morays were repressed and let free all at once, we follow the story of young ones who are out to defy the ogre like characteristics of adults and the adult world en large. The metaphor of a font of healing is a welcome one, though somewhat sugary in the visual department from time to time. Nevertheless, it works. The story follows the very innocent travails of a group of children who seek refuge and healing from world hurts from which adults could not protect them. In the end it is nature that offers a healing balm to wounds thought to be too deep. Truth be told I found the film hard to stick with. I'm not a child anymore, and however well shot the film is, because the cinematography is outstanding, the subject material is aimed at an age that I've long passed. Still, it has a charm that cannot be denied, and technical marks far exceed expectations. It is an incredible film is somewhat basic. A good watch for adults with children. Enjoy.

    Somehow, what you grew up with seems more ancient than many similar things much older. I was seven years old when I first watched "The Secret Garden". Everything seemed more real then, the beauty, the yearning, the fear. But unlike many films that have faded into memory over time, this is one that has grown stronger and more real to me. The character of Mary Lennox (played by Kate Maberly) doesn't begin as the most friendly of people. She is a product of her environment, a bratty, demanding girl who can't imagine anything much beyond getting her way. But don't let that get in the way of identifying with her. Her journey throughout "The Secret Garden" is one of great inner discovery. It's the wondrous power of adventure that brings her out of herself, the understanding that no one will look out for her. Much like the character of Tyler in "Never Cry Wolf" she has a lot to learn about the power of solitude. It makes me wonder how many people in this world could gain something from time spent alone. "The Secret Garden" taught me about the sense of wonder. As the story progresses, things feel more and more magical. Zbigniew Preisnerhas composed a soundtrack that feels like leaves blowing, raindrops falling. He fills the garden itself with a world of beauty, a powerful field of growing music. There is a key scene of time lapse images when the Spring flowers first make their way out of the ground. I love this film with all my heart, from the power of silence to the strength of images (by cinematographer Roger Deakins). Some films are beautiful because they're so real. "The Secret Garden" is real, yes, but it's magic. Pure magic.

    Just the film you would like to watch when you want your mood to change for the better. Even if is based on the classic children's book with the same title, every adult will enjoy and appreciate it too. The young actors, as much as the adults, play their parts very well. I would especially praise Maggie Smith for her robust performance. The part of the leading lady was also remarkably well-performed. Without revealing parts of the story, I will just say that it's about each person having the key to his open betterment and that we should follow our own mind and instincts instead of paying attention to people that want to lock us on prisons (with golden bars or not).

    This was a very endearing film. To see a young niece who has never known turmoil in her life and is spoilt to a fault and also loses her parents in India by local troubles. She is then transported to her uncle's house where her cousin is supposedly terminally ill. Instead, and by happenstance, Mary (niece) uses her ability to see what is real is what is not. Thus by giving her cousin the chance to take his first step in his life than laying in his bed. Yet in the middle, is the housekeeper Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith) who uses her abilities to stop Mary from accomplishing her goal. And that is to keep poor Colin in bed. But through sheer determination and with the help of a young grounds keeper, Dickon (Andrew Knott). They all discover a secret garden which was supposed to be closed forever, until Mary and her unique green thumb re-creates the lush and beautiful landscape for which the manor is known for. This held all aspects of emotions, humour, innocence, sadness, anger, and above all, Love. This will give the home audience a unique perspective about how the will to live without bounds can over come the most difficult obstacles. The Secret Garden is a wonderful film on those nights where there is nothing to do, and it can show a family what a family is supposed to be about. Excellent cast, excellent music and beautiful examples of nature.

    I remember seeing this in the movie theatre with my college roommate and my best friend. What irked me at the start was that they chose to kill people off in an earthquake and not with the Cholera. The earthquake seemed pretty cheesy to me then. (The tornado scene in The Wizard of Oz was more realistic.) The reason given by the director and screenwriter was that no one "these days" knows what Cholera is. Ironically, the week after the movie premiered, there was an earthquake in India and people were worried about Cholera breaking out. As a child reading this book cover to cover so many times that I wore out a copy, the fear of a fever and infectious disease that could get anyone was much scarier than the threat of an earthquake. The child playing Mary wasn't sour at all. She was cranky, and shrill. I never felt sorry for her. Dickon was an afterthought. He is what Mary wants to emulate. She even picks up on his Cockney speech (well, his and Ben Wetherstaff). They completely neglect the Martha/Mary/Mrs. Sowerby story. Here is a woman with more mouths than she can feed herself, and she takes Mary, the sour little yellow orphan into her heart and prayers. It is she who gets Archibald to the Manor upon her pleas that this motherless child need love and warmth. There was so much time spent on the cinematography, that true, joyous parts of this book were lost. When Mary calls Colin (That's COLIN, not KOLIN or COLLIN) a Rajah, he asks her to tell her what one is. That isn't in the book, but he behaves like a spoilt prince as they go outside. That's not the message in the book. In the book, he is a little more awkward and foolish about it. This Mary seems more annoyed at her cousin and his "hump" than defiant. Mary's defiance and determination in the book are what give Colin is gumption to get better. There is none of that in the book. It is a story of two spoiled only children who have to learn to live with someone else their age. There is also no mention of Colin taking pictures and getting jealous of Mary and Dickon in the book. It's an innocent story, why put a modern spin of heated tension between two kids? I do have to admit, seeing it again, that Sleezeball Gerry from Sliding Doors playing Uncle Archie was a bit of a treat. John Lynch is an underrated actor, and I hope to see him as a truly good guy someday. Dame Maggie was very good as the Icy Miss Metlock. I never liked the character, and I still don't. Well done. Someday, maybe before I pass on to my own garden, I will see a version that is truly faithful to the book, with great child actors (the 1949 version is hard to watch because even though the best child actors of the time are in it, they still seem wooden) who actually speak with British accents and a Mary who goes from crisp, Indian influenced British to Cockney. A version that gives us a Mrs. Sowerby and a scene in which Martha talks to her mother about the sour, little, girl. A Dickon who inspires Mary and Colin. While the book continues to run swells in my heart, no movie version of this book has done the same. Oh, and don't even get me started on the versions of "A Little Princess". All I can say is that putting a little African descended scullery maid (read slave) in Victorian England would make William Wilberforce (See the movie or read "Amazing Grace") turn in his grave. -K

    A work of ART. I cannot say enough good things about this film. True to the treasured children's book of the same name, it's author would've been very pleased. Highlighting the contrast between the huge, old, dusty halls of the manor and the healing power and beauty of sunshine and fresh air in a garden. It pays homage to the Earth and those who love her. Excellently cast and acted, beautifully filmed in authentic and amazing locations, with a gentle score. It's magic will cast a spell on you. Perfect family fare or for yourself or someone you love. As a artist, photographer and gardener myself, this is one of my favorite films. I HIGHLY Recommend it.

Yet in the middle, is the housekeeper Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith) who uses her abilities to stop Mary from accomplishing her goal. And that is to keep poor Colin in bed. But through sheer determination and with the help of a young grounds keeper, Dickon (Andrew Knott). They all discover a secret garden which was supposed to be closed forever, until Mary and her unique green thumb re-creates the lush and beautiful landscape for which the manor is known for. This held all aspects of emotions, humour, innocence, sadness, anger, and above all, Love. This will give the home audience a unique perspective about how the will to live without bounds can over come the most difficult obstacles. The Secret Garden is a wonderful film on those nights where there is nothing to do, and it can show a family what a family is supposed to be about. Excellent cast, excellent music and beautiful examples of nature.

    I remember seeing this in the movie theatre with my college roommate and my best friend. What irked me at the start was that they chose to kill people off in an earthquake and not with the Cholera. The earthquake seemed pretty cheesy to me then. (The tornado scene in The Wizard of Oz was more realistic.) The reason given by the director and screenwriter was that no one "these days" knows what Cholera is. Ironically, the week after the movie premiered, there was an earthquake in India and people were worried about Cholera breaking out. As a child reading this book cover to cover so many times that I wore out a copy, the fear of a fever and infectious disease that could get anyone was much scarier than the threat of an earthquake. The child playing Mary wasn't sour at all. She was cranky, and shrill. I never felt sorry for her. Dickon was an afterthought. He is what Mary wants to emulate. She even picks up on his Cockney speech (well, his and Ben Wetherstaff). They completely neglect the Martha/Mary/Mrs. Sowerby story. Here is a woman with more mouths than she can feed herself, and she takes Mary, the sour little yellow orphan into her heart and prayers. It is she who gets Archibald to the Manor upon her pleas that this motherless child need love and warmth. There was so much time spent on the cinematography, that true, joyous parts of this book were lost. When Mary calls Colin (That's COLIN, not KOLIN or COLLIN) a Rajah, he asks her to tell her what one is. That isn't in the book, but he behaves like a spoilt prince as they go outside. That's not the message in the book. In the book, he is a little more awkward and foolish about it. This Mary seems more annoyed at her cousin and his "hump" than defiant. Mary's defiance and determination in the book are what give Colin is gumption to get better. There is none of that in the book. It is a story of two spoiled only children who have to learn to live with someone else their age. There is also no mention of Colin taking pictures and getting jealous of Mary and Dickon in the book. It's an innocent story, why put a modern spin of heated tension between two kids? I do have to admit, seeing it again, that Sleezeball Gerry from Sliding Doors playing Uncle Archie was a bit of a treat. John Lynch is an underrated actor, and I hope to see him as a truly good guy someday. Dame Maggie was very good as the Icy Miss Metlock. I never liked the character, and I still don't. Well done. Someday, maybe before I pass on to my own garden, I will see a version that is truly faithful to the book, with great child actors (the 1949 version is hard to watch because even though the best child actors of the time are in it, they still seem wooden) who actually speak with British accents and a Mary who goes from crisp, Indian influenced British to Cockney. A version that gives us a Mrs. Sowerby and a scene in which Martha talks to her mother about the sour, little, girl. A Dickon who inspires Mary and Colin. While the book continues to run swells in my heart, no movie version of this book has done the same. Oh, and don't even get me started on the versions of "A Little Princess". All I can say is that putting a little African descended scullery maid (read slave) in Victorian England would make William Wilberforce (See the movie or read "Amazing Grace") turn in his grave. -K

    A work of ART. I cannot say enough good things about this film. True to the treasured children's book of the same name, it's author would've been very pleased. Highlighting the contrast between the huge, old, dusty halls of the manor and the healing power and beauty of sunshine and fresh air in a garden. It pays homage to the Earth and those who love her. Excellently cast and acted, beautifully filmed in authentic and amazing locations, with a gentle score. It's magic will cast a spell on you. Perfect family fare or for yourself or someone you love. As a artist, photographer and gardener myself, this is one of my favorite films. I HIGHLY Recommend it.

    The Secret Garden has been adapted many times, but perhaps none so beautifully as this 1993 adaptation, which evokes both the tenderness and haunting beauty of Francis Hodgson Burnett's classic novel (which is one of the finest children's books of all time). The story of Mary Lennox and how her transformation of an abandoned garden at her uncle's Yorkshire manor changes the lives of all around her is lovingly portrayed, with brilliant direction from Polish director Agnieszka Holland, a wonderfully ethereal score by Zbigniew Preisner, and a marvelous cast that seems to come straight out of the pages of the book. Kate Maberly is perfect as the cold, sour little Mary who blossoms inside just like her garden, and there is more fine youthful casting in Heydon Prowse as the spoiled, fragile Colin, Andrew Knott as the gentle-natured Dickon, and Laura Crossley as sweet, talkative Martha. Maggie Smith is fantastic as usual as the stern Mrs. Medlock, and John Lynch gives a haunting performance as the nerve-shattered Lord Craven. It is rare to find family entertainment that is clean, well-scripted, and visually stunning, but this movie fits the bill perfectly. It is a timeless movie that captures the spirit and quality of the timeless story it is adapted from!

    I. Love. this. movie. This is my favorite production of the Secret Garden that I have seen. The acting is superb and the scenery and soundtrack are amazing. The music is haunting and beautiful, I honestly cannot praise it enough. This movie deviates from the book somewhat, but truthfully I think that I like the movie better. I really enjoyed Kate Maberly's portrayal of Mary, she was the perfect combination of charming and sullen. In the book I found Mary very unlikeable throughout, but in this movie Kate was able to make her rude and spoiled (of course she would be with her upbringing)but also she made you have sympathy for Mary, and even like her as she grew as a character and became less irritating. Of course I love that Maggie Smith is in this (how can you not love her?) even if she is the "bad guy". Overall, this movie makes me want to watch it again and again. I loved it as a child, and enjoy it as an adult. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.

    This is my all time favourite film. I used to watch it as a child whenever it was on TV. I loved it. Then about two years ago I bought it on DVD. I've watched it loads of times and I honestly never get bored of it. It's such a beautiful film that it has me crying at the end of it every time I watch it. It has the line "You brought us back to life, Mary. You did something I thought no one could do." which just gets me welling up. Its the one film I can't bring myself to fault. Yes its dated and possibly some errors but it's wonderful. The scenery is beautiful. the story is heartwarming, the acting is brilliant (it's got Maggie Smith in for God's sake!), the characters are different and it just one of those films that everyone can watch and enjoy. I think I've said enough :) Enjoy watching :D

    The 1993 adaptation of The Secret Garden is one of two major adaptations of novels by Frances Hodgson Burnett. The Secret Garden sees Mary Lenox (Kate Maberly), a 10-year-old British girl who was born in India. She is a spoiled brat who has her own personal servant, but is emotionally distance because she was neglected by her parents. But after a massive Earthquake in India, Mary is orphan and sent back to England to live with her uncle. The Northern English manor is run by a harsh matriarch, Mrs Medlock (Maggie Smith) and limits Mary's access to most of the house. But Mary forms friendships with the servant girl Martha (Laura Crossley) and her brother Dickon (Andrew Knott) who has great animal taming abilities, discovers her aunt's secret garden and finds her 'sick' cousin Colin (Heydon Prowse). The Secret Garden does share similarities to A Little Princess, both feature young girls who grew up in India, have lost their parents in some form, both are forced to go to move to a foreign land, have to deal with an authoritarian figure, befriends a servant girl and there is a character who has a magical element to him. But there are differences as well: the main one being the central characters: Mary is a more selfish, spoiled character who has to learn to open up, show emotions, be kind and help her people whilst Sara in A Little Princess has to keep her imagination and kind spirit despite the hardships and lost she suffered. The actual story and setting for both stories is also different with Mary having to help to her cousin, lead to have a passion and learn about her family's past. In comparison to A Little Princess the direction is more sombre and bleaker tone. Director Agnieszka Holland shot the film using a grey fillers and added with the mostly winter setting and barren landscape of the moors gave the film a drowsier feel. Comedy, fantasy and whimsy is toned down and The Secret Garden is a much more grounded and serious film until the end. But it is a delightful family film for all ages and genders. As well as the Earthy look Holland brought there is also some fantastic music from Zbigniew Presiner: perfectly fitting for the film throughout. Those I am a sucker for choir music. The cast is great throughout the filmmakers did find some very talented young actors who gave very convincing performances. Many of them have gone on to have fairly successful careers beyond the film and brought out the interesting aspects from their characters. I personally thought Maberly was actually a better actress then Eleanor Bron was in A Little Princess and she did give a very emotional performance in that film. Smith is also a very formable present, as she is always is, and have very strange motivations to why she is treating Colin the way she does? Is it out of crudity, love or protection? It is up to the audience. The Secret Garden is a very good and strong family film that is serious minded and old-fashioned, but in a good away. I personally preferred The Secret Garden to A Little Princess and I speak as a fan of Alfonso Cuaron.

Agnieszka Holland constructs for the viewer a visual and palpable visual story that takes no prisoners. Set in Victorian England, where social morays were repressed and let free all at once, we follow the story of young ones who are out to defy the ogre like characteristics of adults and the adult world en large. The metaphor of a font of healing is a welcome one, though somewhat sugary in the visual department from time to time. Nevertheless, it works. The story follows the very innocent travails of a group of children who seek refuge and healing from world hurts from which adults could not protect them. In the end it is nature that offers a healing balm to wounds thought to be too deep. Truth be told I found the film hard to stick with. I'm not a child anymore, and however well shot the film is, because the cinematography is outstanding, the subject material is aimed at an age that I've long passed. Still, it has a charm that cannot be denied, and technical marks far exceed expectations. It is an incredible film is somewhat basic. A good watch for adults with children. Enjoy.

    Somehow, what you grew up with seems more ancient than many similar things much older. I was seven years old when I first watched "The Secret Garden". Everything seemed more real then, the beauty, the yearning, the fear. But unlike many films that have faded into memory over time, this is one that has grown stronger and more real to me. The character of Mary Lennox (played by Kate Maberly) doesn't begin as the most friendly of people. She is a product of her environment, a bratty, demanding girl who can't imagine anything much beyond getting her way. But don't let that get in the way of identifying with her. Her journey throughout "The Secret Garden" is one of great inner discovery. It's the wondrous power of adventure that brings her out of herself, the understanding that no one will look out for her. Much like the character of Tyler in "Never Cry Wolf" she has a lot to learn about the power of solitude. It makes me wonder how many people in this world could gain something from time spent alone. "The Secret Garden" taught me about the sense of wonder. As the story progresses, things feel more and more magical. Zbigniew Preisnerhas composed a soundtrack that feels like leaves blowing, raindrops falling. He fills the garden itself with a world of beauty, a powerful field of growing music. There is a key scene of time lapse images when the Spring flowers first make their way out of the ground. I love this film with all my heart, from the power of silence to the strength of images (by cinematographer Roger Deakins). Some films are beautiful because they're so real. "The Secret Garden" is real, yes, but it's magic. Pure magic.

    Just the film you would like to watch when you want your mood to change for the better. Even if is based on the classic children's book with the same title, every adult will enjoy and appreciate it too. The young actors, as much as the adults, play their parts very well. I would especially praise Maggie Smith for her robust performance. The part of the leading lady was also remarkably well-performed. Without revealing parts of the story, I will just say that it's about each person having the key to his open betterment and that we should follow our own mind and instincts instead of paying attention to people that want to lock us on prisons (with golden bars or not).

    This was a very endearing film. To see a young niece who has never known turmoil in her life and is spoilt to a fault and also loses her parents in India by local troubles. She is then transported to her uncle's house where her cousin is supposedly terminally ill. Instead, and by happenstance, Mary (niece) uses her ability to see what is real is what is not. Thus by giving her cousin the chance to take his first step in his life than laying in his bed. Yet in the middle, is the housekeeper Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith) who uses her abilities to stop Mary from accomplishing her goal. And that is to keep poor Colin in bed. But through sheer determination and with the help of a young grounds keeper, Dickon (Andrew Knott). They all discover a secret garden which was supposed to be closed forever, until Mary and her unique green thumb re-creates the lush and beautiful landscape for which the manor is known for. This held all aspects of emotions, humour, innocence, sadness, anger, and above all, Love. This will give the home audience a unique perspective about how the will to live without bounds can over come the most difficult obstacles. The Secret Garden is a wonderful film on those nights where there is nothing to do, and it can show a family what a family is supposed to be about. Excellent cast, excellent music and beautiful examples of nature.

    I remember seeing this in the movie theatre with my college roommate and my best friend. What irked me at the start was that they chose to kill people off in an earthquake and not with the Cholera. The earthquake seemed pretty cheesy to me then. (The tornado scene in The Wizard of Oz was more realistic.) The reason given by the director and screenwriter was that no one "these days" knows what Cholera is. Ironically, the week after the movie premiered, there was an earthquake in India and people were worried about Cholera breaking out. As a child reading this book cover to cover so many times that I wore out a copy, the fear of a fever and infectious disease that could get anyone was much scarier than the threat of an earthquake. The child playing Mary wasn't sour at all. She was cranky, and shrill. I never felt sorry for her. Dickon was an afterthought. He is what Mary wants to emulate. She even picks up on his Cockney speech (well, his and Ben Wetherstaff). They completely neglect the Martha/Mary/Mrs. Sowerby story. Here is a woman with more mouths than she can feed herself, and she takes Mary, the sour little yellow orphan into her heart and prayers. It is she who gets Archibald to the Manor upon her pleas that this motherless child need love and warmth. There was so much time spent on the cinematography, that true, joyous parts of this book were lost. When Mary calls Colin (That's COLIN, not KOLIN or COLLIN) a Rajah, he asks her to tell her what one is. That isn't in the book, but he behaves like a spoilt prince as they go outside.

    And just overall well constructed. Yet another magnificent Coppola production from the halls of creativity itself. Agnieszka Holland constructs for the viewer a visual and palpable visual story that takes no prisoners. Set in Victorian England, where social morays were repressed and let free all at once, we follow the story of young ones who are out to defy the ogre like characteristics of adults and the adult world en large. The metaphor of a font of healing is a welcome one, though somewhat sugary in the visual department from time to time. Nevertheless, it works. The story follows the very innocent travails of a group of children who seek refuge and healing from world hurts from which adults could not protect them. In the end it is nature that offers a healing balm to wounds thought to be too deep. Truth be told I found the film hard to stick with. I'm not a child anymore, and however well shot the film is, because the cinematography is outstanding, the subject material is aimed at an age that I've long passed. Still, it has a charm that cannot be denied, and technical marks far exceed expectations. It is an incredible film is somewhat basic. A good watch for adults with children. Enjoy.

    Somehow, what you grew up with seems more ancient than many similar things much older. I was seven years old when I first watched "The Secret Garden". Everything seemed more real then, the beauty, the yearning, the fear. But unlike many films that have faded into memory over time, this is one that has grown stronger and more real to me. The character of Mary Lennox (played by Kate Maberly) doesn't begin as the most friendly of people. She is a product of her environment, a bratty, demanding girl who can't imagine anything much beyond getting her way. But don't let that get in the way of identifying with her. Her journey throughout "The Secret Garden" is one of great inner discovery. It's the wondrous power of adventure that brings her out of herself, the understanding that no one will look out for her. Much like the character of Tyler in "Never Cry Wolf" she has a lot to learn about the power of solitude. It makes me wonder how many people in this world could gain something from time spent alone. "The Secret Garden" taught me about the sense of wonder. As the story progresses, things feel more and more magical. Zbigniew Preisnerhas composed a soundtrack that feels like leaves blowing, raindrops falling. He fills the garden itself with a world of beauty, a powerful field of growing music. There is a key scene of time lapse images when the Spring flowers first make their way out of the ground. I love this film with all my heart, from the power of silence to the strength of images (by cinematographer Roger Deakins). Some films are beautiful because they're so real. "The Secret Garden" is real, yes, but it's magic. Pure magic.

    Just the film you would like to watch when you want your mood to change for the better. Even if is based on the classic children's book with the same title, every adult will enjoy and appreciate it too. The young actors, as much as the adults, play their parts very well. I would especially praise Maggie Smith for her robust performance. The part of the leading lady was also remarkably well-performed. Without revealing parts of the story, I will just say that it's about each person having the key to his open betterment and that we should follow our own mind and instincts instead of paying attention to people that want to lock us on prisons (with golden bars or not).

    This was a very endearing film. To see a young niece who has never known turmoil in her life and is spoilt to a fault and also loses her parents in India by local troubles. She is then transported to her uncle's house where her cousin is supposedly terminally ill. Instead, and by happenstance, Mary (niece) uses her ability to see what is real is what is not. Thus by giving her cousin the chance to take his first step in his life than laying in his bed. Yet in the middle, is the housekeeper Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith) who uses her abilities to stop Mary from accomplishing her goal. And that is to keep poor Colin in bed. But through sheer determination and with the help of a young grounds keeper, Dickon (Andrew Knott). They all discover a secret garden which was supposed to be closed forever, until Mary and her unique green thumb re-creates the lush and beautiful landscape for which the manor is known for. This held all aspects of emotions, humour, innocence, sadness, anger, and above all, Love. This will give the home audience a unique perspective about how the will to live without bounds can over come the most difficult obstacles. The Secret Garden is a wonderful film on those nights where there is nothing to do, and it can show a family what a family is supposed to be about. Excellent cast, excellent music and beautiful examples of nature.

    I remember seeing this in the movie theatre with my college roommate and my best friend. What irked me at the start was that they chose to kill people off in an earthquake and not with the Cholera. The earthquake seemed pretty cheesy to me then. (The tornado scene in The Wizard of Oz was more realistic.) The reason given by the director and screenwriter was that no one "these days" knows what Cholera is. Ironically, the week after the movie premiered, there was an earthquake in India and people were worried about Cholera breaking out. As a child reading this book cover to cover so many times that I wore out a copy, the fear of a fever and infectious disease that could get anyone was much scarier than the threat of an earthquake. The child playing Mary wasn't sour at all. She was cranky, and shrill. I never felt sorry for her. Dickon was an afterthought. He is what Mary wants to emulate. She even picks up on his Cockney speech (well, his and Ben Wetherstaff). They completely neglect the Martha/Mary/Mrs. Sowerby story. Here is a woman with more mouths than she can feed herself, and she takes Mary, the sour little yellow orphan into her heart and prayers. It is she who gets Archibald to the Manor upon her pleas that this motherless child need love and warmth. There was so much time spent on the cinematography, that true, joyous parts of this book were lost. When Mary calls Colin (That's COLIN, not KOLIN or COLLIN) a Rajah, he asks her to tell her what one is. That isn't in the book, but he behaves like a spoilt prince as they go outside. That's not the message in the book. In the book, he is a little more awkward and foolish about it. This Mary seems more annoyed at her cousin and his "hump" than defiant. Mary's defiance and determination in the book are what give Colin is gumption to get better. There is none of that in the book. It is a story of two spoiled only children who have to learn to live with someone else their age. There is also no mention of Colin taking pictures and getting jealous of Mary and Dickon in the book. It's an innocent story, why put a modern spin of heated tension between two kids? I do have to admit, seeing it again, that Sleezeball Gerry from Sliding Doors playing Uncle Archie was a bit of a treat. John Lynch is an underrated actor, and I hope to see him as a truly good guy someday. Dame Maggie was very good as the Icy Miss Metlock. I never liked the character, and I still don't. Well done. Someday, maybe before I pass on to my own garden, I will see a version that is truly faithful to the book, with great child actors (the 1949 version is hard to watch because even though the best child actors of the time are in it, they still seem wooden) who actually speak with British accents and a Mary who goes from crisp, Indian influenced British to Cockney. A version that gives us a Mrs. Sowerby and a scene in which Martha talks to her mother about the sour, little, girl. A Dickon who inspires Mary and Colin. While the book continues to run swells in my heart, no movie version of this book has done the same. Oh, and don't even get me started on the versions of "A Little Princess". All I can say is that putting a little African descended scullery maid (read slave) in Victorian England would make William Wilberforce (See the movie or read "Amazing Grace") turn in his grave. -K

Highlighting the contrast between the huge, old, dusty halls of the manor and the healing power and beauty of sunshine and fresh air in a garden. It pays homage to the Earth and those who love her. Excellently cast and acted, beautifully filmed in authentic and amazing locations, with a gentle score. It's magic will cast a spell on you. Perfect family fare or for yourself or someone you love. As a artist, photographer and gardener myself, this is one of my favorite films. I HIGHLY Recommend it.

    The Secret Garden has been adapted many times, but perhaps none so beautifully as this 1993 adaptation, which evokes both the tenderness and haunting beauty of Francis Hodgson Burnett's classic novel (which is one of the finest children's books of all time). The story of Mary Lennox and how her transformation of an abandoned garden at her uncle's Yorkshire manor changes the lives of all around her is lovingly portrayed, with brilliant direction from Polish director Agnieszka Holland, a wonderfully ethereal score by Zbigniew Preisner, and a marvelous cast that seems to come straight out of the pages of the book. Kate Maberly is perfect as the cold, sour little Mary who blossoms inside just like her garden, and there is more fine youthful casting in Heydon Prowse as the spoiled, fragile Colin, Andrew Knott as the gentle-natured Dickon, and Laura Crossley as sweet, talkative Martha. Maggie Smith is fantastic as usual as the stern Mrs. Medlock, and John Lynch gives a haunting performance as the nerve-shattered Lord Craven. It is rare to find family entertainment that is clean, well-scripted, and visually stunning, but this movie fits the bill perfectly. It is a timeless movie that captures the spirit and quality of the timeless story it is adapted from!

    I. Love. this. movie. This is my favorite production of the Secret Garden that I have seen. The acting is superb and the scenery and soundtrack are amazing. The music is haunting and beautiful, I honestly cannot praise it enough. This movie deviates from the book somewhat, but truthfully I think that I like the movie better. I really enjoyed Kate Maberly's portrayal of Mary, she was the perfect combination of charming and sullen. In the book I found Mary very unlikeable throughout, but in this movie Kate was able to make her rude and spoiled (of course she would be with her upbringing)but also she made you have sympathy for Mary, and even like her as she grew as a character and became less irritating. Of course I love that Maggie Smith is in this (how can you not love her?) even if she is the "bad guy". Overall, this movie makes me want to watch it again and again. I loved it as a child, and enjoy it as an adult. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.

    This is my all time favourite film. I used to watch it as a child whenever it was on TV. I loved it. Then about two years ago I bought it on DVD. I've watched it loads of times and I honestly never get bored of it. It's such a beautiful film that it has me crying at the end of it every time I watch it. It has the line "You brought us back to life, Mary. You did something I thought no one could do." which just gets me welling up. Its the one film I can't bring myself to fault. Yes its dated and possibly some errors but it's wonderful. The scenery is beautiful. the story is heartwarming, the acting is brilliant (it's got Maggie Smith in for God's sake!), the characters are different and it just one of those films that everyone can watch and enjoy. I think I've said enough :) Enjoy watching :D

    The 1993 adaptation of The Secret Garden is one of two major adaptations of novels by Frances Hodgson Burnett. The Secret Garden sees Mary Lenox (Kate Maberly), a 10-year-old British girl who was born in India. She is a spoiled brat who has her own personal servant, but is emotionally distance because she was neglected by her parents. But after a massive Earthquake in India, Mary is orphan and sent back to England to live with her uncle. The Northern English manor is run by a harsh matriarch, Mrs Medlock (Maggie Smith) and limits Mary's access to most of the house. But Mary forms friendships with the servant girl Martha (Laura Crossley) and her brother Dickon (Andrew Knott) who has great animal taming abilities, discovers her aunt's secret garden and finds her 'sick' cousin Colin (Heydon Prowse). The Secret Garden does share similarities to A Little Princess, both feature young girls who grew up in India, have lost their parents in some form, both are forced to go to move to a foreign land, have to deal with an authoritarian figure, befriends a servant girl and there is a character who has a magical element to him. But there are differences as well: the main one being the central characters: Mary is a more selfish, spoiled character who has to learn to open up, show emotions, be kind and help her people whilst Sara in A Little Princess has to keep her imagination and kind spirit despite the hardships and lost she suffered. The actual story and setting for both stories is also different with Mary having to help to her cousin, lead to have a passion and learn about her family's past. In comparison to A Little Princess the direction is more sombre and bleaker tone. Director Agnieszka Holland shot the film using a grey fillers and added with the mostly winter setting and barren landscape of the moors gave the film a drowsier feel. Comedy, fantasy and whimsy is toned down and The Secret Garden is a much more grounded and serious film until the end. But it is a delightful family film for all ages and genders. As well as the Earthy look Holland brought there is also some fantastic music from Zbigniew Presiner: perfectly fitting for the film throughout. Those I am a sucker for choir music. The cast is great throughout the filmmakers did find some very talented young actors who gave very convincing performances. Many of them have gone on to have fairly successful careers beyond the film and brought out the interesting aspects from their characters. I personally thought Maberly was actually a better actress then Eleanor Bron was in A Little Princess and she did give a very emotional performance in that film. Smith is also a very formable present, as she is always is, and have very strange motivations to why she is treating Colin the way she does? Is it out of crudity, love or protection? It is up to the audience. The Secret Garden is a very good and strong family film that is serious minded and old-fashioned, but in a good away. I personally preferred The Secret Garden to A Little Princess and I speak as a fan of Alfonso Cuaron.

    And just overall well constructed. Yet another magnificent Coppola production from the halls of creativity itself. Agnieszka Holland constructs for the viewer a visual and palpable visual story that takes no prisoners. Set in Victorian England, where social morays were repressed and let free all at once, we follow the story of young ones who are out to defy the ogre like characteristics of adults and the adult world en large. The metaphor of a font of healing is a welcome one, though somewhat sugary in the visual department from time to time. Nevertheless, it works. The story follows the very innocent travails of a group of children who seek refuge and healing from world hurts from which adults could not protect them. In the end it is nature that offers a healing balm to wounds thought to be too deep. Truth be told I found the film hard to stick with. I'm not a child anymore, and however well shot the film is, because the cinematography is outstanding, the subject material is aimed at an age that I've long passed. Still, it has a charm that cannot be denied, and technical marks far exceed expectations. It is an incredible film is somewhat basic. A good watch for adults with children. Enjoy.

    Somehow, what you grew up with seems more ancient than many similar things much older. I was seven years old when I first watched "The Secret Garden". Everything seemed more real then, the beauty, the yearning, the fear. But unlike many films that have faded into memory over time, this is one that has grown stronger and more real to me. The character of Mary Lennox (played by Kate Maberly) doesn't begin as the most friendly of people. She is a product of her environment, a bratty, demanding girl who can't imagine anything much beyond getting her way. But don't let that get in the way of identifying with her. Her journey throughout "The Secret Garden" is one of great inner discovery. It's the wondrous power of adventure that brings her out of herself, the understanding that no one will look out for her. Much like the character of Tyler in "Never Cry Wolf" she has a lot to learn about the power of solitude. It makes me wonder how many people in this world could gain something from time spent alone. "The Secret Garden" taught me about the sense of wonder. As the story progresses, things feel more and more magical. Zbigniew Preisnerhas composed a soundtrack that feels like leaves blowing, raindrops falling. He fills the garden itself with a world of beauty, a powerful field of growing music. There is a key scene of time lapse images when the Spring flowers first make their way out of the ground. I love this film with all my heart, from the power of silence to the strength of images (by cinematographer Roger Deakins). Some films are beautiful because they're so real. "The Secret Garden" is real, yes, but it's magic. Pure magic.

The actual story and setting for both stories is also different with Mary having to help to her cousin, lead to have a passion and learn about her family's past. In comparison to A Little Princess the direction is more sombre and bleaker tone. Director Agnieszka Holland shot the film using a grey fillers and added with the mostly winter setting and barren landscape of the moors gave the film a drowsier feel. Comedy, fantasy and whimsy is toned down and The Secret Garden is a much more grounded and serious film until the end. But it is a delightful family film for all ages and genders. As well as the Earthy look Holland brought there is also some fantastic music from Zbigniew Presiner: perfectly fitting for the film throughout. Those I am a sucker for choir music. The cast is great throughout the filmmakers did find some very talented young actors who gave very convincing performances. Many of them have gone on to have fairly successful careers beyond the film and brought out the interesting aspects from their characters. I personally thought Maberly was actually a better actress then Eleanor Bron was in A Little Princess and she did give a very emotional performance in that film. Smith is also a very formable present, as she is always is, and have very strange motivations to why she is treating Colin the way she does? Is it out of crudity, love or protection? It is up to the audience. The Secret Garden is a very good and strong family film that is serious minded and old-fashioned, but in a good away. I personally preferred The Secret Garden to A Little Princess and I speak as a fan of Alfonso Cuaron.

    And just overall well constructed. Yet another magnificent Coppola production from the halls of creativity itself. Agnieszka Holland constructs for the viewer a visual and palpable visual story that takes no prisoners. Set in Victorian England, where social morays were repressed and let free all at once, we follow the story of young ones who are out to defy the ogre like characteristics of adults and the adult world en large. The metaphor of a font of healing is a welcome one, though somewhat sugary in the visual department from time to time. Nevertheless, it works. The story follows the very innocent travails of a group of children who seek refuge and healing from world hurts from which adults could not protect them. In the end it is nature that offers a healing balm to wounds thought to be too deep. Truth be told I found the film hard to stick with. I'm not a child anymore, and however well shot the film is, because the cinematography is outstanding, the subject material is aimed at an age that I've long passed. Still, it has a charm that cannot be denied, and technical marks far exceed expectations. It is an incredible film is somewhat basic. A good watch for adults with children. Enjoy.

    Somehow, what you grew up with seems more ancient than many similar things much older. I was seven years old when I first watched "The Secret Garden". Everything seemed more real then, the beauty, the yearning, the fear. But unlike many films that have faded into memory over time, this is one that has grown stronger and more real to me. The character of Mary Lennox (played by Kate Maberly) doesn't begin as the most friendly of people. She is a product of her environment, a bratty, demanding girl who can't imagine anything much beyond getting her way. But don't let that get in the way of identifying with her. Her journey throughout "The Secret Garden" is one of great inner discovery. It's the wondrous power of adventure that brings her out of herself, the understanding that no one will look out for her. Much like the character of Tyler in "Never Cry Wolf" she has a lot to learn about the power of solitude. It makes me wonder how many people in this world could gain something from time spent alone. "The Secret Garden" taught me about the sense of wonder. As the story progresses, things feel more and more magical. Zbigniew Preisnerhas composed a soundtrack that feels like leaves blowing, raindrops falling. He fills the garden itself with a world of beauty, a powerful field of growing music. There is a key scene of time lapse images when the Spring flowers first make their way out of the ground. I love this film with all my heart, from the power of silence to the strength of images (by cinematographer Roger Deakins). Some films are beautiful because they're so real. "The Secret Garden" is real, yes, but it's magic. Pure magic.

    Just the film you would like to watch when you want your mood to change for the better. Even if is based on the classic children's book with the same title, every adult will enjoy and appreciate it too. The young actors, as much as the adults, play their parts very well. I would especially praise Maggie Smith for her robust performance. The part of the leading lady was also remarkably well-performed. Without revealing parts of the story, I will just say that it's about each person having the key to his open betterment and that we should follow our own mind and instincts instead of paying attention to people that want to lock us on prisons (with golden bars or not).

    This was a very endearing film. To see a young niece who has never known turmoil in her life and is spoilt to a fault and also loses her parents in India by local troubles. She is then transported to her uncle's house where her cousin is supposedly terminally ill. Instead, and by happenstance, Mary (niece) uses her ability to see what is real is what is not. Thus by giving her cousin the chance to take his first step in his life than laying in his bed. Yet in the middle, is the housekeeper Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith) who uses her abilities to stop Mary from accomplishing her goal. And that is to keep poor Colin in bed. But through sheer determination and with the help of a young grounds keeper, Dickon (Andrew Knott). They all discover a secret garden which was supposed to be closed forever, until Mary and her unique green thumb re-creates the lush and beautiful landscape for which the manor is known for. This held all aspects of emotions, humour, innocence, sadness, anger, and above all, Love. This will give the home audience a unique perspective about how the will to live without bounds can over come the most difficult obstacles. The Secret Garden is a wonderful film on those nights where there is nothing to do, and it can show a family what a family is supposed to be about. Excellent cast, excellent music and beautiful examples of nature.

    I remember seeing this in the movie theatre with my college roommate and my best friend. What irked me at the start was that they chose to kill people off in an earthquake and not with the Cholera. The earthquake seemed pretty cheesy to me then. (The tornado scene in The Wizard of Oz was more realistic.) The reason given by the director and screenwriter was that no one "these days" knows what Cholera is. Ironically, the week after the movie premiered, there was an earthquake in India and people were worried about Cholera breaking out. As a child reading this book cover to cover so many times that I wore out a copy, the fear of a fever and infectious disease that could get anyone was much scarier than the threat of an earthquake. The child playing Mary wasn't sour at all. She was cranky, and shrill. I never felt sorry for her. Dickon was an afterthought. He is what Mary wants to emulate. She even picks up on his Cockney speech (well, his and Ben Wetherstaff). They completely neglect the Martha/Mary/Mrs. Sowerby story. Here is a woman with more mouths than she can feed herself, and she takes Mary, the sour little yellow orphan into her heart and prayers. It is she who gets Archibald to the Manor upon her pleas that this motherless child need love and warmth. There was so much time spent on the cinematography, that true, joyous parts of this book were lost. When Mary calls Colin (That's COLIN, not KOLIN or COLLIN) a Rajah, he asks her to tell her what one is. That isn't in the book, but he behaves like a spoilt prince as they go outside. That's not the message in the book. In the book, he is a little more awkward and foolish about it. This Mary seems more annoyed at her cousin and his "hump" than defiant. Mary's defiance and determination in the book are what give Colin is gumption to get better. There is none of that in the book. It is a story of two spoiled only children who have to learn to live with someone else their age. There is also no mention of Colin taking pictures and getting jealous of Mary and Dickon in the book. It's an innocent story, why put a modern spin of heated tension between two kids? I do have to admit, seeing it again, that Sleezeball Gerry from Sliding Doors playing Uncle Archie was a bit of a treat. John Lynch is an underrated actor, and I hope to see him as a truly good guy someday. Dame Maggie was very good as the Icy Miss Metlock. I never liked the character, and I still don't. Well done. Someday, maybe before I pass on to my own garden, I will see a version that is truly faithful to the book, with great child actors (the 1949 version is hard to watch because even though the best child actors of the time are in it, they still seem wooden) who actually speak with British accents and a Mary who goes from crisp, Indian influenced British to Cockney. A version that gives us a Mrs. Sowerby and a scene in which Martha talks to her mother about the sour, little, girl. A Dickon who inspires Mary and Colin. While the book continues to run swells in my heart, no movie version of this book has done the same. Oh, and don't even get me started on the versions of "A Little Princess". All I can say is that putting a little African descended scullery maid (read slave) in Victorian England would make William Wilberforce (See the movie or read "Amazing Grace") turn in his grave. -K

Highlighting the contrast between the huge, old, dusty halls of the manor and the healing power and beauty of sunshine and fresh air in a garden. It pays homage to the Earth and those who love her. Excellently cast and acted, beautifully filmed in authentic and amazing locations, with a gentle score. It's magic will cast a spell on you. Perfect family fare or for yourself or someone you love. As a artist, photographer and gardener myself, this is one of my favorite films. I HIGHLY Recommend it.

    The Secret Garden has been adapted many times, but perhaps none so beautifully as this 1993 adaptation, which evokes both the tenderness and haunting beauty of Francis Hodgson Burnett's classic novel (which is one of the finest children's books of all time). The story of Mary Lennox and how her transformation of an abandoned garden at her uncle's Yorkshire manor changes the lives of all around her is lovingly portrayed, with brilliant direction from Polish director Agnieszka Holland, a wonderfully ethereal score by Zbigniew Preisner, and a marvelous cast that seems to come straight out of the pages of the book. Kate Maberly is perfect as the cold, sour little Mary who blossoms inside just like her garden, and there is more fine youthful casting in Heydon Prowse as the spoiled, fragile Colin, Andrew Knott as the gentle-natured Dickon, and Laura Crossley as sweet, talkative Martha. Maggie Smith is fantastic as usual as the stern Mrs. Medlock, and John Lynch gives a haunting performance as the nerve-shattered Lord Craven. It is rare to find family entertainment that is clean, well-scripted, and visually stunning, but this movie fits the bill perfectly. It is a timeless movie that captures the spirit and quality of the timeless story it is adapted from!

    I. Love. this. movie. This is my favorite production of the Secret Garden that I have seen. The acting is superb and the scenery and soundtrack are amazing. The music is haunting and beautiful, I honestly cannot praise it enough. This movie deviates from the book somewhat, but truthfully I think that I like the movie better. I really enjoyed Kate Maberly's portrayal of Mary, she was the perfect combination of charming and sullen. In the book I found Mary very unlikeable throughout, but in this movie Kate was able to make her rude and spoiled (of course she would be with her upbringing)but also she made you have sympathy for Mary, and even like her as she grew as a character and became less irritating. Of course I love that Maggie Smith is in this (how can you not love her?) even if she is the "bad guy". Overall, this movie makes me want to watch it again and again. I loved it as a child, and enjoy it as an adult. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.

    This is my all time favourite film. I used to watch it as a child whenever it was on TV. I loved it. Then about two years ago I bought it on DVD. I've watched it loads of times and I honestly never get bored of it. It's such a beautiful film that it has me crying at the end of it every time I watch it. It has the line "You brought us back to life, Mary. You did something I thought no one could do." which just gets me welling up. Its the one film I can't bring myself to fault. Yes its dated and possibly some errors but it's wonderful. The scenery is beautiful. the story is heartwarming, the acting is brilliant (it's got Maggie Smith in for God's sake!), the characters are different and it just one of those films that everyone can watch and enjoy. I think I've said enough :) Enjoy watching :D

    The 1993 adaptation of The Secret Garden is one of two major adaptations of novels by Frances Hodgson Burnett. The Secret Garden sees Mary Lenox (Kate Maberly), a 10-year-old British girl who was born in India. She is a spoiled brat who has her own personal servant, but is emotionally distance because she was neglected by her parents. But after a massive Earthquake in India, Mary is orphan and sent back to England to live with her uncle. The Northern English manor is run by a harsh matriarch, Mrs Medlock (Maggie Smith) and limits Mary's access to most of the house. But Mary forms friendships with the servant girl Martha (Laura Crossley) and her brother Dickon (Andrew Knott) who has great animal taming abilities, discovers her aunt's secret garden and finds her 'sick' cousin Colin (Heydon Prowse). The Secret Garden does share similarities to A Little Princess, both feature young girls who grew up in India, have lost their parents in some form, both are forced to go to move to a foreign land, have to deal with an authoritarian figure, befriends a servant girl and there is a character who has a magical element to him. But there are differences as well: the main one being the central characters: Mary is a more selfish, spoiled character who has to learn to open up, show emotions, be kind and help her people whilst Sara in A Little Princess has to keep her imagination and kind spirit despite the hardships and lost she suffered. The actual story and setting for both stories is also different with Mary having to help to her cousin, lead to have a passion and learn about her family's past. In comparison to A Little Princess the direction is more sombre and bleaker tone. Director Agnieszka Holland shot the film using a grey fillers and added with the mostly winter setting and barren landscape of the moors gave the film a drowsier feel. Comedy, fantasy and whimsy is toned down and The Secret Garden is a much more grounded and serious film until the end. But it is a delightful family film for all ages and genders. As well as the Earthy look Holland brought there is also some fantastic music from Zbigniew Presiner: perfectly fitting for the film throughout. Those I am a sucker for choir music. The cast is great throughout the filmmakers did find some very talented young actors who gave very convincing performances. Many of them have gone on to have fairly successful careers beyond the film and brought out the interesting aspects from their characters. I personally thought Maberly was actually a better actress then Eleanor Bron was in A Little Princess and she did give a very emotional performance in that film. Smith is also a very formable present, as she is always is, and have very strange motivations to why she is treating Colin the way she does? Is it out of crudity, love or protection? It is up to the audience. The Secret Garden is a very good and strong family film that is serious minded and old-fashioned, but in a good away. I personally preferred The Secret Garden to A Little Princess and I speak as a fan of Alfonso Cuaron.

    And just overall well constructed. Yet another magnificent Coppola production from the halls of creativity itself. Agnieszka Holland constructs for the viewer a visual and palpable visual story that takes no prisoners. Set in Victorian England, where social morays were repressed and let free all at once, we follow the story of young ones who are out to defy the ogre like characteristics of adults and the adult world en large. The metaphor of a font of healing is a welcome one, though somewhat sugary in the visual department from time to time. Nevertheless, it works. The story follows the very innocent travails of a group of children who seek refuge and healing from world hurts from which adults could not protect them. In the end it is nature that offers a healing balm to wounds thought to be too deep. Truth be told I found the film hard to stick with. I'm not a child anymore, and however well shot the film is, because the cinematography is outstanding, the subject material is aimed at an age that I've long passed. Still, it has a charm that cannot be denied, and technical marks far exceed expectations. It is an incredible film is somewhat basic. A good watch for adults with children. Enjoy.

"The Secret Garden" taught me about the sense of wonder. As the story progresses, things feel more and more magical. Zbigniew Preisnerhas composed a soundtrack that feels like leaves blowing, raindrops falling. He fills the garden itself with a world of beauty, a powerful field of growing music. There is a key scene of time lapse images when the Spring flowers first make their way out of the ground.

The music is haunting and beautiful, I honestly cannot praise it enough. This movie deviates from the book somewhat, but truthfully I think that I like the movie better. I really enjoyed Kate Maberly's portrayal of Mary, she was the perfect combination of charming and sullen. In the book I found Mary very unlikeable throughout, but in this movie Kate was able to make her rude and spoiled (of course she would be with her upbringing)but also she made you have sympathy for Mary, and even like her as she grew as a character and became less irritating. Of course I love that Maggie Smith is in this (how can you not love her?) even if she is the "bad guy". Overall, this movie makes me want to watch it again and again. I loved it as a child, and enjoy it as an adult. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.

    This is my all time favourite film. I used to watch it as a child whenever it was on TV. I loved it. Then about two years ago I bought it on DVD. I've watched it loads of times and I honestly never get bored of it. It's such a beautiful film that it has me crying at the end of it every time I watch it. It has the line "You brought us back to life, Mary. You did something I thought no one could do." which just gets me welling up. Its the one film I can't bring myself to fault. Yes its dated and possibly some errors but it's wonderful. The scenery is beautiful. the story is heartwarming, the acting is brilliant (it's got Maggie Smith in for God's sake!), the characters are different and it just one of those films that everyone can watch and enjoy. I think I've said enough :) Enjoy watching :D

    The 1993 adaptation of The Secret Garden is one of two major adaptations of novels by Frances Hodgson Burnett. The Secret Garden sees Mary Lenox (Kate Maberly), a 10-year-old British girl who was born in India. She is a spoiled brat who has her own personal servant, but is emotionally distance because she was neglected by her parents. But after a massive Earthquake in India, Mary is orphan and sent back to England to live with her uncle. The Northern English manor is run by a harsh matriarch, Mrs Medlock (Maggie Smith) and limits Mary's access to most of the house. But Mary forms friendships with the servant girl Martha (Laura Crossley) and her brother Dickon (Andrew Knott) who has great animal taming abilities, discovers her aunt's secret garden and finds her 'sick' cousin Colin (Heydon Prowse). The Secret Garden does share similarities to A Little Princess, both feature young girls who grew up in India, have lost their parents in some form, both are forced to go to move to a foreign land, have to deal with an authoritarian figure, befriends a servant girl and there is a character who has a magical element to him. But there are differences as well: the main one being the central characters: Mary is a more selfish, spoiled character who has to learn to open up, show emotions, be kind and help her people whilst Sara in A Little Princess has to keep her imagination and kind spirit despite the hardships and lost she suffered. The actual story and setting for both stories is also different with Mary having to help to her cousin, lead to have a passion and learn about her family's past. In comparison to A Little Princess the direction is more sombre and bleaker tone. Director Agnieszka Holland shot the film using a grey fillers and added with the mostly winter setting and barren landscape of the moors gave the film a drowsier feel. Comedy, fantasy and whimsy is toned down and The Secret Garden is a much more grounded and serious film until the end. But it is a delightful family film for all ages and genders. As well as the Earthy look Holland brought there is also some fantastic music from Zbigniew Presiner: perfectly fitting for the film throughout. Those I am a sucker for choir music. The cast is great throughout the filmmakers did find some very talented young actors who gave very convincing performances. Many of them have gone on to have fairly successful careers beyond the film and brought out the interesting aspects from their characters. I personally thought Maberly was actually a better actress then Eleanor Bron was in A Little Princess and she did give a very emotional performance in that film. Smith is also a very formable present, as she is always is, and have very strange motivations to why she is treating Colin the way she does? Is it out of crudity, love or protection? It is up to the audience. The Secret Garden is a very good and strong family film that is serious minded and old-fashioned, but in a good away. I personally preferred The Secret Garden to A Little Princess and I speak as a fan of Alfonso Cuaron.

    And just overall well constructed. Yet another magnificent Coppola production from the halls of creativity itself. Agnieszka Holland constructs for the viewer a visual and palpable visual story that takes no prisoners. Set in Victorian England, where social morays were repressed and let free all at once, we follow the story of young ones who are out to defy the ogre like characteristics of adults and the adult world en large. The metaphor of a font of healing is a welcome one, though somewhat sugary in the visual department from time to time. Nevertheless, it works. The story follows the very innocent travails of a group of children who seek refuge and healing from world hurts from which adults could not protect them. In the end it is nature that offers a healing balm to wounds thought to be too deep. Truth be told I found the film hard to stick with. I'm not a child anymore, and however well shot the film is, because the cinematography is outstanding, the subject material is aimed at an age that I've long passed. Still, it has a charm that cannot be denied, and technical marks far exceed expectations. It is an incredible film is somewhat basic. A good watch for adults with children. Enjoy.

    Somehow, what you grew up with seems more ancient than many similar things much older. I was seven years old when I first watched "The Secret Garden". Everything seemed more real then, the beauty, the yearning, the fear. But unlike many films that have faded into memory over time, this is one that has grown stronger and more real to me. The character of Mary Lennox (played by Kate Maberly) doesn't begin as the most friendly of people. She is a product of her environment, a bratty, demanding girl who can't imagine anything much beyond getting her way. But don't let that get in the way of identifying with her. Her journey throughout "The Secret Garden" is one of great inner discovery. It's the wondrous power of adventure that brings her out of herself, the understanding that no one will look out for her. Much like the character of Tyler in "Never Cry Wolf" she has a lot to learn about the power of solitude. It makes me wonder how many people in this world could gain something from time spent alone. "The Secret Garden" taught me about the sense of wonder. As the story progresses, things feel more and more magical. Zbigniew Preisnerhas composed a soundtrack that feels like leaves blowing, raindrops falling. He fills the garden itself with a world of beauty, a powerful field of growing music. There is a key scene of time lapse images when the Spring flowers first make their way out of the ground. I love this film with all my heart, from the power of silence to the strength of images (by cinematographer Roger Deakins). Some films are beautiful because they're so real. "The Secret Garden" is real, yes, but it's magic. Pure magic.

    Just the film you would like to watch when you want your mood to change for the better. Even if is based on the classic children's book with the same title, every adult will enjoy and appreciate it too. The young actors, as much as the adults, play their parts very well. I would especially praise Maggie Smith for her robust performance. The part of the leading lady was also remarkably well-performed. Without revealing parts of the story, I will just say that it's about each person having the key to his open betterment and that we should follow our own mind and instincts instead of paying attention to people that want to lock us on prisons (with golden bars or not).

She is then transported to her uncle's house where her cousin is supposedly terminally ill. Instead, and by happenstance, Mary (niece) uses her ability to see what is real is what is not. Thus by giving her cousin the chance to take his first step in his life than laying in his bed. Yet in the middle, is the housekeeper Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith) who uses her abilities to stop Mary from accomplishing her goal. And that is to keep poor Colin in bed. But through sheer determination and with the help of a young grounds keeper, Dickon (Andrew Knott). They all discover a secret garden which was supposed to be closed forever, until Mary and her unique green thumb re-creates the lush and beautiful landscape for which the manor is known for. This held all aspects of emotions, humour, innocence, sadness, anger, and above all, Love. This will give the home audience a unique perspective about how the will to live without bounds can over come the most difficult obstacles. The Secret Garden is a wonderful film on those nights where there is nothing to do, and it can show a family what a family is supposed to be about. Excellent cast, excellent music and beautiful examples of nature.

    I remember seeing this in the movie theatre with my college roommate and my best friend. What irked me at the start was that they chose to kill people off in an earthquake and not with the Cholera. The earthquake seemed pretty cheesy to me then. (The tornado scene in The Wizard of Oz was more realistic.) The reason given by the director and screenwriter was that no one "these days" knows what Cholera is. Ironically, the week after the movie premiered, there was an earthquake in India and people were worried about Cholera breaking out. As a child reading this book cover to cover so many times that I wore out a copy, the fear of a fever and infectious disease that could get anyone was much scarier than the threat of an earthquake. The child playing Mary wasn't sour at all. She was cranky, and shrill. I never felt sorry for her. Dickon was an afterthought. He is what Mary wants to emulate. She even picks up on his Cockney speech (well, his and Ben Wetherstaff). They completely neglect the Martha/Mary/Mrs. Sowerby story. Here is a woman with more mouths than she can feed herself, and she takes Mary, the sour little yellow orphan into her heart and prayers. It is she who gets Archibald to the Manor upon her pleas that this motherless child need love and warmth. There was so much time spent on the cinematography, that true, joyous parts of this book were lost. When Mary calls Colin (That's COLIN, not KOLIN or COLLIN) a Rajah, he asks her to tell her what one is. That isn't in the book, but he behaves like a spoilt prince as they go outside. That's not the message in the book. In the book, he is a little more awkward and foolish about it. This Mary seems more annoyed at her cousin and his "hump" than defiant. Mary's defiance and determination in the book are what give Colin is gumption to get better. There is none of that in the book. It is a story of two spoiled only children who have to learn to live with someone else their age. There is also no mention of Colin taking pictures and getting jealous of Mary and Dickon in the book. It's an innocent story, why put a modern spin of heated tension between two kids? I do have to admit, seeing it again, that Sleezeball Gerry from Sliding Doors playing Uncle Archie was a bit of a treat. John Lynch is an underrated actor, and I hope to see him as a truly good guy someday. Dame Maggie was very good as the Icy Miss Metlock. I never liked the character, and I still don't. Well done. Someday, maybe before I pass on to my own garden, I will see a version that is truly faithful to the book, with great child actors (the 1949 version is hard to watch because even though the best child actors of the time are in it, they still seem wooden) who actually speak with British accents and a Mary who goes from crisp, Indian influenced British to Cockney. A version that gives us a Mrs. Sowerby and a scene in which Martha talks to her mother about the sour, little, girl. A Dickon who inspires Mary and Colin. While the book continues to run swells in my heart, no movie version of this book has done the same. Oh, and don't even get me started on the versions of "A Little Princess". All I can say is that putting a little African descended scullery maid (read slave) in Victorian England would make William Wilberforce (See the movie or read "Amazing Grace") turn in his grave. -K

    A work of ART. I cannot say enough good things about this film. True to the treasured children's book of the same name, it's author would've been very pleased. Highlighting the contrast between the huge, old, dusty halls of the manor and the healing power and beauty of sunshine and fresh air in a garden. It pays homage to the Earth and those who love her. Excellently cast and acted, beautifully filmed in authentic and amazing locations, with a gentle score. It's magic will cast a spell on you. Perfect family fare or for yourself or someone you love. As a artist, photographer and gardener myself, this is one of my favorite films. I HIGHLY Recommend it.

    The Secret Garden has been adapted many times, but perhaps none so beautifully as this 1993 adaptation, which evokes both the tenderness and haunting beauty of Francis Hodgson Burnett's classic novel (which is one of the finest children's books of all time). The story of Mary Lennox and how her transformation of an abandoned garden at her uncle's Yorkshire manor changes the lives of all around her is lovingly portrayed, with brilliant direction from Polish director Agnieszka Holland, a wonderfully ethereal score by Zbigniew Preisner, and a marvelous cast that seems to come straight out of the pages of the book. Kate Maberly is perfect as the cold, sour little Mary who blossoms inside just like her garden, and there is more fine youthful casting in Heydon Prowse as the spoiled, fragile Colin, Andrew Knott as the gentle-natured Dickon, and Laura Crossley as sweet, talkative Martha. Maggie Smith is fantastic as usual as the stern Mrs. Medlock, and John Lynch gives a haunting performance as the nerve-shattered Lord Craven. It is rare to find family entertainment that is clean, well-scripted, and visually stunning, but this movie fits the bill perfectly. It is a timeless movie that captures the spirit and quality of the timeless story it is adapted from!

In comparison to A Little Princess the direction is more sombre and bleaker tone. Director Agnieszka Holland shot the film using a grey fillers and added with the mostly winter setting and barren landscape of the moors gave the film a drowsier feel. Comedy, fantasy and whimsy is toned down and The Secret Garden is a much more grounded and serious film until the end. But it is a delightful family film for all ages and genders. As well as the Earthy look Holland brought there is also some fantastic music from Zbigniew Presiner: perfectly fitting for the film throughout. Those I am a sucker for choir music. The cast is great throughout the filmmakers did find some very talented young actors who gave very convincing performances.

While the book continues to run swells in my heart, no movie version of this book has done the same. Oh, and don't even get me started on the versions of "A Little Princess". All I can say is that putting a little African descended scullery maid (read slave) in Victorian England would make William Wilberforce (See the movie or read "Amazing Grace") turn in his grave. -K

    A work of ART. I cannot say enough good things about this film. True to the treasured children's book of the same name, it's author would've been very pleased. Highlighting the contrast between the huge, old, dusty halls of the manor and the healing power and beauty of sunshine and fresh air in a garden. It pays homage to the Earth and those who love her. Excellently cast and acted, beautifully filmed in authentic and amazing locations, with a gentle score. It's magic will cast a spell on you. Perfect family fare or for yourself or someone you love. As a artist, photographer and gardener myself, this is one of my favorite films. I HIGHLY Recommend it.
