    After watching "In The Company of Men" it left me with an awful taste in my mouth. But at the same time it was a great movie watching experience as we examine the more lower depths of how inhumane we can really be as a society and yet still somehow manage to get with doing our actions. The strange irony is that this film runs at very unreasonable levels. The two leading male characters are couple of hateful humans that it in-spite of their wicked demeanour, I still seemed quite intrigued as what will transpire between these characters. Neil LaBute who wrote and directed this film gave freedom to the movie to just let things flow and avoids it from being preachy or overly moralizing. To me it makes this comedy all the more darker and at the same time more effective too. This tale focuses on a businessman named Chard (Aaron Eckhart), who without hesitation brutally confesses to his friend Howard (Matt Malloy) how much he despises all that is female. So then Chard persuades Howard into a scheming plot in which they're lead on a vulnerable woman and eventually when all is said and done, he will dump her. Chad's reason is a vicious plot at revenge due to the ways women have treated men. Chad assumes that their six-week hiatus to a satellite office is the perfect facility to carry this cruel scheme and while at that take the time to make a mockery on this poor victim at her expense. Howard himself goes along with the scheme feeling that this master-plan will backfire and through self-obligation, sides with Chad to see what will transpire. The plan starts to materialize as the lab rat for this scheme is a naive, shy secretary named Christine (Stacy Edwards) who works at the satellite office who is also deaf. The whole film, Chad and Howard take turns charming Christine, while that's progressing, their scheme starts to get out of control and takes its turns in expected turn of events. The manipulative schemes the men have on poor Christine are very deceitful that it's hard to watch at times. In the case of Chad, the plot is an attempt to emerge victorious as a ploy to further express his disdain to the female gender. Howard feels this scheme is unlawful, it more like to be aware of what's inside looking out instead of vice-versa. The audience and even Hoawrd himself know this plot will not work out. In most movies and T.V. shows they never do. But it's still intriguing in how this plan will come crashing down on them. And we hope that there might be a small fragment of humanity between Chad and Howard. Sure the outcome is predictable, but it's still fun to watch how it will backfire. The reason for dark comedy isn't the jokes or the action by the leading stars, but the laughter rests in the vicinity of what lengths people will go to to express how hateful we as human race truly are. The character-driven film scores high points in terms of depth. In addition to that it makes us reconsider our actions by what we say and do I'm glad that Mr. LaBute ended the film with a moral lesson or a perfectly wrapped happy ending. In the end in this case, the antagonist comes out the winner. And in the real world, bad people usually end up victorious in many situations. Granted Chad is a handsome individual and can wow the ladies with his charm quite easily. But at the same time time he's hypocritical, obnoxious and quite the condescending person who looks a nice person you want to punch in the mouth with. But he is still easy to identify with. There are a lot of Chad's out there And yet you feel sick to your stomach because you understand the psyche of this character so in the end I'm the jerk that has the egg on his face. The whole Chad, Howard and Christine love factor has some noteworthy things of interest here. You have two to put it loosely gentlemen of contrasting backgrounds. You have Chad, the handsome, suave ladies man, and then you have Howard who comes across as socially awkward who like most people of his kind in society are the one's who never come out on top (me included). And it's obvious Christine chooses the suave one over the awkward one. Matt Malloy was excellent portraying Howard. At fist he come across as an introverted individual. However, in the pivotal scenes in the end, it's a breath of fresh air when he lashes out when his buttons are pushed. Once the dust settles, we find these two jerks madly in love with Christine being the unlucky victim due to her being deaf. Both fall victim to the metaphoric love potion. Chad is at a loss of words to admit he loves her while Howard feels short that lost in a situation where he should have won. But in spite of the shortcomings within the characters, it is a wonderful character-driven story that might be hard to swallow in some situations.

    Neil Labute's "In The Company of Men" stars Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy as Chad and Howard, a pair of mid-level corporate executives sent to a boring regional branch for six weeks on a short term project. Frustrated, recently burnt by women, stuck in a career rut and high on corporate testosterone, the duo hatch a plan. "Let's hurt somebody," alpha-male Chad says. Pretty soon they're cooking up a Machiavellian scheme to locate an insecure woman, date her simultaneously, and dump her in the most vicious way possible. The woman they set their sights on is handicapped co-worker Christine. Christine has a speech impediment, but what she says doesn't matter to Chad anyway. Denied a voice, Chad handles her like an object to be acquired, traded, owned and discarded. Labute is heavily influenced by David Mamet. Most of the film finds Chad spewing corporate maxims, strutting about like a Master of the Universe and forcing co-workers to grovel at his feet. Eventually its revealed that Chad's scheming extends even to his "friend" Howard. He's your classic Extreme Sociopath, charming but endlessly manipulative. Everyone's his puppet. And as with Mamet's "workplace flicks", Chad's less a character than an extreme manifestation of a corporate logic whose drive for profit, ownership and expansion slowly infects how everyone around him thinks, acts and feels. Eventually Chad becomes both a norm and standard to aspire to. He's the new hypermasculinist ideal, for whom humiliation, domination, degradation, exploitation and suffering conflate with success. It's not only that aggressive competition in business affects masculinity, romance and sexual behaviour, but that corporate logic magnifies power, the ego and sanctions what is essentially various forms of rape. This stance is the opposite of how contemporary ideology is (mis)perceived, in which "business" is seen to be "neutral" and "mutually beneficial". Chad's a character who's popped up in many films and stories. More interesting is Howard, a fairly meek guy who is corrupted and made to do things even more horrible than Chad. The real world is made up of Howards. Chad's the anomaly, existing always more as spirit or underlying drive. La Bute penned "The Shape of Things" as an attempt to reverse the gender roles of "Company". Arguably his best film, it's also part of a tight trilogy by Labute about people's perceptions of physicality ("Fat Pig", "Reasons to be Pretty", "Shape of Things"). Massive spoilers ahead. "The Shape of Things" initially unfolds like a conventional romantic comedy. We're introduced to a dishevelled English Literature student called Adam, played by the always likable Paul Rudd, and an attractive art student called Evelyn (Rachel Weisz). The film then becomes a modern version of Adam's seduction by Eve. Eve ensnares Adam, manipulates him into becoming "fit", "attractive" and "healthy", and then reveals that she has never had romantic feelings toward him; she was merely using Adam as a sort of living art installation, a clay puppet, deceptively sculpting and moulding his mind and body. When Eve reveals her scheme to Adam Â– she invites him to an art installation in which he is quite literally presented as an exhibited object, her gaze now likened to the masculinist gaze of "In The Company of Men" - he's dumbfounded. Eve's tricked him into getting cosmetic surgery and altering his personality and physique. She's reconstructed him. Treated him as a chunk of malleable flesh. Unlike "Company", we're then invited to work our way through the messy ethical minefield of the victimiser's actions. For while Chad deservedly gets no sympathy in "Company", the relationship in "Things" is much harder to work out. Is Adam now a better person? Was Eve's love, no matter how virtual, beneficial to Adam? Was it ever real? How much authority should be given, or do we give, to artists? How much ethical responsibility do they hold or exercise? How do power relationships within romantic couples overlap with the power we grant artists? Don't Eve's actions echo the sexism of "Compny"? What is acceptable artistic material? Do the means, in art, justify the ends? At what point does creation become manipulation, is manipulation ever justified and at what point does creation destroy (see "Vertigo")? Is Adam now a beautiful work of "art" despite Eve's actions? How do Eve's actions differ from other vampiric artists, who take from and/or abuse outside sources? What does the film say about romance and the lover's desire to alter their partner? Art may be made by monsters, but what about the audience who enjoys? And on and on it goes. The film features a shot of the sentence "There is no morality in art". The quote's by Chinese novelist Han Suiyin, and is stencilled over Eve's art gallery. Throughout the film Eve articulates a similarly postmodern stance: "it's all subjective", she says, "moralists have no place in an art gallery". The firm itself is structured, we think, as an artist's apologia. Its first scene portrays Eve as an iconoclast who thrice breaks the rules, stepping over a rope at a museum, taking an illegal photograph of a sculpture and painting a penis onto a statue which has been censored by uptight museum curators. "You stepped over the line, Miss," curator Adam prophetically says when he firsts meets her. But as Eve makes clear, there should be no lines. We agree with her for much of the film. Afterall, hasn't she liberated Adam? By the film's end, however, we're asked to reconsider Eve's stance. Labute himself reconfigures Han Suiyin's quote. It's not that "there is no morality in art", in the sense that morality should not apply to art, but more literally, that "there is now, no longer, morality in art". Artists have no ethical compass, social feeling or attachment toward world, community or fellowman. Such art doesn't only exist in a vacuum, but is inherently selfish and nihilistic. You know, like Chad. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Almost every line and every scene in this tight, aggressive film is purposeful. Aaron Eckhart's performance as Chad is relaxed, controlled, and indifferently sadistic without being brutal. Matt Malloy's performance as Howard is absolutely necessary to the success of the film. The audience is never supposed to respect Howard, and Malloy commits unflinchingly to the role. Howard, in the end, discovers that he has been purposelessly led by his own weakness to want vindication for his ego--instead, he becomes a pathetic imitation of a romantic hero for a moral purpose he pretended to ignore. Some of the script suffers from believability. The beginning of the film, when Howard is slapped for asking a woman the time, is pretty unreasonable. If the film is (even an implicit) argument that women provoke men to be cruel, it proceeds from a false premise. The story boils down to the simple logic that Chad can manipulate and destroy Howard because Howard believes he's able to manipulate and destroy someone else. I envision Chad as a kind of false Satan--a man who pretends to be against God and morality solely for the purpose of seducing and destroying the lives of characters who believe in him. "How does it feel to really hurt someone?"

    In the Company of Men is a movie that makes one consider his or her actions after watching. The film puts the human conscience to the test by illustrating an exaggerated example of how heartless people can be at times. The film centered around three main characters. Aaron Eckhart played Chad, the arrogant, back-stabbing and ruthless bad guy. Christine, played by Stacy Edwards, was the first of Chad's "victims" of cruelty. Matt Malloy played Howard, a man who thought Chad was his friend. In early portions of the film, the theme appears to be revenge upon women by scorned men. However, as the plot thickens, the true theme of the film reveals itself. It turns out that Chad is planning to hurt anyone he can. The real theme of the film is that some people care about only themselves. Chad is a classic case of one of those people. Throughout the film, he carefully executes a plan to hurt Christine, a deaf woman who has not dated in a long time, due to her handicap. He uses Howard to help in the act of hurting Christine. Chad eventually accomplishes his main goal. However, Howard develops feelings for Christine and tells her that he and Chad had set out to hurt her from the beginning. He also tells her that he has fallen in love with her, although she never gives him a chance to prove that. As a result, Howard ends up being hurt as well. As the plan to hurt Christine comes to fruition, other subplots become evident. Smaller examples of the theme come to light. Chad organizes a series of events that lead to Howard being demoted from his position in the company he and Chad work for. It was no coincidence that Chad eventually was promoted to Howard's position. As the viewer watches Chad's plans unfold, certain elements of film production can be detected as enhancers of the theme. For example, the music between scenes is bold and loud. It gives one the impression that something ominous is going to happen. The music seems to create an element of building tension. One anticipates a huge event of a bad nature. The camera angles chosen for many of the scenes make Chad seem very powerful and evil. The scenes that use upward views of Chad and Howard together are particularly persuasive toward creating this impression. The various angles used in the date scenes between Chad and Christine further emphasize Chad's lack of conscience. The theme of this film, and the execution of the theme, is very similar to that found in The Usual Suspects. Both films focus on a character that is deceiving people purposely. They are also similar, in that the "villain" is not found out by the other characters until the end of the movie. The only difference is that Chad is not so eager to get away clean with his acts. He seems to be proud of his actions, and willingly tells Howard what he has done. This film's theme is one that makes some consider their actions, while it makes others strive to achieve such power. The effect it has on you should say something about the kind of person you are. It made me consider how awful it feels to be hurt. Those involved in making this film have put together a powerful piece that, while lacking in action, forces people to examine themselves and others.

    Misogynist Film of the Moment: In the Company of Men 3 11 2009 I just watched one of the worst movies ever. I share my opinion only because I want you to watch it as well and see if you relate or if you are repulsed. Some of you might've seen it before. The title sounded familiar and its for that reason that I let the movie take my evening away from me. There was an award given to the filmmaker. It was released in 1997. I usually don't blast movies because they are supposed to leave you in a mood. The director and writer don't do a good job of portraying the comedy to this dark comedy though, and as a result it comes off as a serious film, and leaves a bad taste in the viewers mouth. Do not let your girlfriends watch this movie. It will only add to the man hate already happening. This is fuel to the fire. That said, if you do watch it, try to figure out which of the two guys you are more like, Chad or Howard, and get back at me. I might have to start a new column where I share these discoveries with you. This is an insult to misogynists everywhere. Not approved. In The Company Of Men ----Ryan Mega sexdrugsmoney.com

    Chad is a perfect example of a sociopath/psychopath, someone who is amoral, takes risks in his personal and work life, is utterly charming when he is working on someone, but cold and and cruel when he no longer needs them. I thought this film was a brilliant portrayal of the psychopath and how he draws in his victims. Lying is second nature to him, he takes everything in his stride because he has no emotional response to anything that transpires. Chad is in control and it is almost hypnotic to see him manipulate those around him. There was another thread running through the story, the office politics, and Howard appeared to have missed what was really happening - just like a real life victim, he would not have realised just how evil Chad is. Definitely one for my collection of films about psychos.

    I remember seeing In the Company of Men a very long time agoÂ…not sure exactly when, but it was when I began noticing independent films verses big budgeted all-name films. And I loved it. It was a refreshing change from explosions every few minutes. Unfortunately, times have changed. Yeah, I still like the film Â– I am a sucker for "super-human" characters, and Chad (Eckhart) certainly is. But, now my eyes opened, recently, to pacing and movies that overstay their welcomes. Don't give up on this movie, however. It's a somewhat original idea with excellent acting from Eckhart as an, excuse my English, asshole whose main purpose is to see people suffer for mere amusement. Here we have two "gentlemen," Howard (Malloy) and Chad who work together Â– one being the boss, though they graduated close to each other, and are sent for six weeks to an undisclosed city to set up their sales business. In a little down time Â– as few and far between it is, Howard admits to his buddy that he's been recently dumped by his girlfriend. Chad retorts with his story of love-lost with his girlfriend and then proposes the idea of the movie: revenge against women. Chad wants to find that special nobody, and have both him and Howard date her, romance her, make her feel like she's on top of the world and then simply pull the rug out and laugh as she falls. Sounds cruel? Well, yeahÂ…there's no other way to describe it. However, it gets worse; the one they pick, Christine (Edwards) is deaf. They do what they set out to. But, unfortunately for the movie's sake: they make it painfully obvious that one will fall (for her,) one will rise and the end result is what you expect. What holds the movie together and makes it worth a viewing is Eckhart as Chad. He's evil. He's borderline Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct) but he's somewhat more despicable than Stone, because he makes this all the more real. Also, they both smoke like a chimneyÂ…not that it's relevant Â– it's just probably thrown in as "you simply can't trust a smoker" I'm assuming. In addition, the end revolutions, when both Chad Â– who explains his motivations, and Howard who, well, shouts his, also make it worthy of a complete viewing. And finally: Edwards who plays Christine, is really NOT deaf in real life, so her acting and "speech" is truly impressive. Listen to the audio commentary. This is real acting. It's not fast paced and it's based on the stereotypical movie "lie" approach that always leads to the clich&eacute; revolutionary scene, but it's interesting as a "yeah, this could really happen" story and the actual climax is quite fulfilling. Eckhart is so good in this role; you almost root for him, despite his evil intentions. The writing is good enough to see he did place his pieces (people) in the exact locations he wanted them and that's not pulled off by most actors. I do love super-human characters that use people as pawns. Stone did it brilliantly in Basic Instinct and Eckhart proved he could almost (give it about 80%) match her. Only, some of his scenes Â– such as, show me your balls Â– were a little off-kilter. As was his character.

    Engrossing and fascinating, if uncompromisingly nasty, film from provocateur Neil LaBute. Two businessmen, one alpha male, the other paunchy wimp, play with the emotions of a deaf coworker as a way to vent their own frustrations about work, sex -- and just about everything else about being human. The resulting film is angry and predictably uncomfortable to watch, but the compelling writing and performances are enough to keep you engaged. This was the first film to introduce me to the considerable talents of Aaron Eckhart, a chronically underrated actor. Grade: A-

    Early in the movie the premise of the story line is made clear. Two Yuppie businessmen away on a project in a branch office are discussing their relationships with women. They tell each other how badly they have treated them and how downtrodden they feel. This leads one of them to come up with a plan, which he convinces the other fellow to join in with him. They will find unsuspecting, susceptible young woman during the six weeks that are away. They will each wine, dine and romance her simultaneously and then both will dump her and leave town. As one of them puts it, in the future no matter how badly they are treated by girlfriends, their wives or even their bosses, they will look back and know that nobody treated them as badly as they were going to treat this women. Nice guys? Now what does this movie show us? What insight into the human mind or into the mind of some subtype of men can we glean? Well, they carry out the plan albeit with some complications. When she realizes what was done to her, the young woman says to one of the men, "Why did you do this?" He answers, "Because I could?" Does that line sound familiar? Although the line became famous a few years after this movie was made Bill Clinton is the person who immortalized those words in response to a question from Dan Rather in a 60 Minute TV interview as to why he had his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton replied, "I think I did something for the worst possible reason-just because I could. I think that's the most, just about the most morally indefensible reason that anybody could have for doing anything. When you do something just because you couldÂ… I've thought about it a lot. And there are lots of more sophisticated explanations, more complicated psychological explanations. But none of them are an excuse." Those psychological reasons may vary from person to person and there were two male characters in the movie and of course Clinton is a character himself. In some there is a core of self-centeredness or narcissism, some of which may make you a good leader or a boss but too much of it will be a disaster. Then in some individuals there is a great insecurity, which can include jealousy and aggression. We saw a mixture of these in our characters in the movie. Director Neil LaBute made the six week time span move quickly and actors Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy were excellent. Although the performance of Stacy Edwards was also top notch, there was controversy in some circles who thought that a real deaf actress should have played the part. We should have mentioned that the susceptible attractive young women who was to be dumped had lost her hearing at age 8 and had a speech impairment. Some may find this movie very thought provoking. Hopefully it won't be too close to home.

    Here we have corporate culture at its worst in the 90s; two men, a decade out of college, going city to city and making their money by giving presentations and telling others what to do. It's a high-pressure job with what appears to be small reward. Both Chad and Howard are slowly becoming fed up as they see younger men rise quicker and with less work ethic; they see their wives and girlfriends leave them without warning, breaking their hearts as their souls are destroyed in the workplace. It has become too much for Chad and he is looking for revenge. What better way to do so than at the demise of a girl, the fairer sex in which he says is composed of women "all the same, meat and gristle and hatred just simmering"? What if they could lead on some poor soul who has reached a point in her life where the prospect of a relationship or a future full of love is unattainable and than destroy her for sport to watch the reaction? Hell, they'll always be able to tell each other afterwards, "They never got me the way we got her". The writing is cynical and witty; this is one of the blackest comedies you will ever view. I literally felt bad laughing at times, but it is constructed so smartly, you just can't help yourself. Howard is a wormy romantic who knows Chad, the epitome of alpha male, from college and has stayed close through the years. He would never partake in a game such as this if not for the tale of his stronger buddy being cleaned out by his girl, even having the frame around his American Gigolo poster taken from him. If the sort of heartbreak Howard feels can happen to his friend too, well than maybe the female race deserves to be taught a lesson; unfortunately for temp Christine, that exercise will be brought upon her in full. She is the perfect fodder for their six week revenge plan, not only is she attractive, but she is deaf. Handicapped to the point where she wears headphones to appear distracted when unable to hear someone walk by, she is so far removed from the dating scene that the advances of two successful men in the office may just be too strong for her to pass up. Both men work together to show her so much affection that she will have to fall for at least one. Love, however, wasn't anticipated to play a role in the proceedings. As the weeks advance, the dates become more intimate, the bonds stronger. Sitting and watching the advancement starts to make it tough to discern true motivations. Are Chad and Howard really falling for her or are they that good at pretending in order to make the breakup as devastating as possible? Howard may not be getting as close physically to the girl, but his actions express a longing and need to be with her. Chad, on the other hand, working his magic and getting her in bed, has acquired the phrase he's been working towards, having her tell him she loves him. He responds in kind, but is it real? We will have to wait and see in week six whether the game has gone too far or whether it has gone just as planned. That statement may seem cruel, because the fact the ruse began at all means it went too farÂ—they are playing with an innocent's emotions and heart for sportÂ—but in the context of the film, you do start to buy into it and want to see what kind of fallout will result. LaBute does come from the stage and it shows here in his first film as most scenes are constructed from long takes and static setups. One moment on the rooftop has Chad almost flub a line, but they keep going, either to keep a sense of realism or save money on reshooting the exchange. Definitely shot on the cheap, it becomes the job of the actors to perform at the highest level, and they do not disappoint. Stacy Edwards is amazing as Christine, both in her portrayal of a deaf woman and in the emotional turmoil she must go through from start to finish. Also remember too, see is deceiving them by going out with both at the same time, selfishly keeping her own happiness above them knowing the truth. But it is Matt Malloy and Aaron Eckhart, as Howard and Chad respectively, that really carry the film. Malloy is a ball of nerves and insecurities, yet when he needs to be, either lying to the girl or venting to his friend, can compose himself to a man of power and force. Needing incentive to be confident, it is in him, but the moments where his insecurities rear their head shine above all else; never able to control the situation, he slowly devolves into a version of Chad. Chad, conversely, doesn't have a weak bone to his name. He says at the end that he can sell anyone, and it is true. The lines he utters are pure gold and I can see why it was hard for him to get work early in his career. Eckhart played a prick so well, no one wanted the controversy surrounding this role to take anything away from the new work. He is so conniving, so manipulative, yet with a smile that can charm us all. This film exists due to his performance and the revelations at the conclusion only cement him as one of the best screen villains ever. I'd love to see this story on stage, because The Shape of Things blew away its brilliant screen counterpart when I saw a college production, and I can only imagine watching this acted out in front of me would do the same if not more.

    After watching "In The Company of Men" it left me with an awful taste in my mouth. But at the same time it was a great movie watching experience as we examine the more lower depths of how inhumane we can really be as a society and yet still somehow manage to get with doing our actions. The strange irony is that this film runs at very unreasonable levels. The two leading male characters are couple of hateful humans that it in-spite of their wicked demeanour, I still seemed quite intrigued as what will transpire between these characters. Neil LaBute who wrote and directed this film gave freedom to the movie to just let things flow and avoids it from being preachy or overly moralizing. To me it makes this comedy all the more darker and at the same time more effective too. This tale focuses on a businessman named Chard (Aaron Eckhart), who without hesitation brutally confesses to his friend Howard (Matt Malloy) how much he despises all that is female. So then Chard persuades Howard into a scheming plot in which they're lead on a vulnerable woman and eventually when all is said and done, he will dump her. Chad's reason is a vicious plot at revenge due to the ways women have treated men. Chad assumes that their six-week hiatus to a satellite office is the perfect facility to carry this cruel scheme and while at that take the time to make a mockery on this poor victim at her expense. Howard himself goes along with the scheme feeling that this master-plan will backfire and through self-obligation, sides with Chad to see what will transpire. The plan starts to materialize as the lab rat for this scheme is a naive, shy secretary named Christine (Stacy Edwards) who works at the satellite office who is also deaf. The whole film, Chad and Howard take turns charming Christine, while that's progressing, their scheme starts to get out of control and takes its turns in expected turn of events. The manipulative schemes the men have on poor Christine are very deceitful that it's hard to watch at times. In the case of Chad, the plot is an attempt to emerge victorious as a ploy to further express his disdain to the female gender. Howard feels this scheme is unlawful, it more like to be aware of what's inside looking out instead of vice-versa. The audience and even Hoawrd himself know this plot will not work out. In most movies and T.V. shows they never do. But it's still intriguing in how this plan will come crashing down on them. And we hope that there might be a small fragment of humanity between Chad and Howard. Sure the outcome is predictable, but it's still fun to watch how it will backfire. The reason for dark comedy isn't the jokes or the action by the leading stars, but the laughter rests in the vicinity of what lengths people will go to to express how hateful we as human race truly are. The character-driven film scores high points in terms of depth. In addition to that it makes us reconsider our actions by what we say and do I'm glad that Mr. LaBute ended the film with a moral lesson or a perfectly wrapped happy ending. In the end in this case, the antagonist comes out the winner. And in the real world, bad people usually end up victorious in many situations. Granted Chad is a handsome individual and can wow the ladies with his charm quite easily. But at the same time time he's hypocritical, obnoxious and quite the condescending person who looks a nice person you want to punch in the mouth with. But he is still easy to identify with. There are a lot of Chad's out there And yet you feel sick to your stomach because you understand the psyche of this character so in the end I'm the jerk that has the egg on his face. The whole Chad, Howard and Christine love factor has some noteworthy things of interest here. You have two to put it loosely gentlemen of contrasting backgrounds. You have Chad, the handsome, suave ladies man, and then you have Howard who comes across as socially awkward who like most people of his kind in society are the one's who never come out on top (me included). And it's obvious Christine chooses the suave one over the awkward one. Matt Malloy was excellent portraying Howard. At fist he come across as an introverted individual. However, in the pivotal scenes in the end, it's a breath of fresh air when he lashes out when his buttons are pushed. Once the dust settles, we find these two jerks madly in love with Christine being the unlucky victim due to her being deaf. Both fall victim to the metaphoric love potion. Chad is at a loss of words to admit he loves her while Howard feels short that lost in a situation where he should have won. But in spite of the shortcomings within the characters, it is a wonderful character-driven story that might be hard to swallow in some situations.

    Neil Labute's "In The Company of Men" stars Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy as Chad and Howard, a pair of mid-level corporate executives sent to a boring regional branch for six weeks on a short term project. Frustrated, recently burnt by women, stuck in a career rut and high on corporate testosterone, the duo hatch a plan. "Let's hurt somebody," alpha-male Chad says. Pretty soon they're cooking up a Machiavellian scheme to locate an insecure woman, date her simultaneously, and dump her in the most vicious way possible. The woman they set their sights on is handicapped co-worker Christine. Christine has a speech impediment, but what she says doesn't matter to Chad anyway. Denied a voice, Chad handles her like an object to be acquired, traded, owned and discarded. Labute is heavily influenced by David Mamet. Most of the film finds Chad spewing corporate maxims, strutting about like a Master of the Universe and forcing co-workers to grovel at his feet. Eventually its revealed that Chad's scheming extends even to his "friend" Howard. He's your classic Extreme Sociopath, charming but endlessly manipulative. Everyone's his puppet. And as with Mamet's "workplace flicks", Chad's less a character than an extreme manifestation of a corporate logic whose drive for profit, ownership and expansion slowly infects how everyone around him thinks, acts and feels. Eventually Chad becomes both a norm and standard to aspire to. He's the new hypermasculinist ideal, for whom humiliation, domination, degradation, exploitation and suffering conflate with success. It's not only that aggressive competition in business affects masculinity, romance and sexual behaviour, but that corporate logic magnifies power, the ego and sanctions what is essentially various forms of rape. This stance is the opposite of how contemporary ideology is (mis)perceived, in which "business" is seen to be "neutral" and "mutually beneficial". Chad's a character who's popped up in many films and stories. More interesting is Howard, a fairly meek guy who is corrupted and made to do things even more horrible than Chad. The real world is made up of Howards. Chad's the anomaly, existing always more as spirit or underlying drive. La Bute penned "The Shape of Things" as an attempt to reverse the gender roles of "Company". Arguably his best film, it's also part of a tight trilogy by Labute about people's perceptions of physicality ("Fat Pig", "Reasons to be Pretty", "Shape of Things"). Massive spoilers ahead. "The Shape of Things" initially unfolds like a conventional romantic comedy. We're introduced to a dishevelled English Literature student called Adam, played by the always likable Paul Rudd, and an attractive art student called Evelyn (Rachel Weisz). The film then becomes a modern version of Adam's seduction by Eve. Eve ensnares Adam, manipulates him into becoming "fit", "attractive" and "healthy", and then reveals that she has never had romantic feelings toward him; she was merely using Adam as a sort of living art installation, a clay puppet, deceptively sculpting and moulding his mind and body. When Eve reveals her scheme to Adam Â– she invites him to an art installation in which he is quite literally presented as an exhibited object, her gaze now likened to the masculinist gaze of "In The Company of Men" - he's dumbfounded. Eve's tricked him into getting cosmetic surgery and altering his personality and physique. She's reconstructed him. Treated him as a chunk of malleable flesh. Unlike "Company", we're then invited to work our way through the messy ethical minefield of the victimiser's actions. For while Chad deservedly gets no sympathy in "Company", the relationship in "Things" is much harder to work out. Is Adam now a better person? Was Eve's love, no matter how virtual, beneficial to Adam? Was it ever real? How much authority should be given, or do we give, to artists? How much ethical responsibility do they hold or exercise? How do power relationships within romantic couples overlap with the power we grant artists? Don't Eve's actions echo the sexism of "Compny"? What is acceptable artistic material? Do the means, in art, justify the ends? At what point does creation become manipulation, is manipulation ever justified and at what point does creation destroy (see "Vertigo")? Is Adam now a beautiful work of "art" despite Eve's actions? How do Eve's actions differ from other vampiric artists, who take from and/or abuse outside sources? What does the film say about romance and the lover's desire to alter their partner? Art may be made by monsters, but what about the audience who enjoys? And on and on it goes. The film features a shot of the sentence "There is no morality in art". The quote's by Chinese novelist Han Suiyin, and is stencilled over Eve's art gallery. Throughout the film Eve articulates a similarly postmodern stance: "it's all subjective", she says, "moralists have no place in an art gallery". The firm itself is structured, we think, as an artist's apologia. Its first scene portrays Eve as an iconoclast who thrice breaks the rules, stepping over a rope at a museum, taking an illegal photograph of a sculpture and painting a penis onto a statue which has been censored by uptight museum curators. "You stepped over the line, Miss," curator Adam prophetically says when he firsts meets her. But as Eve makes clear, there should be no lines. We agree with her for much of the film. Afterall, hasn't she liberated Adam? By the film's end, however, we're asked to reconsider Eve's stance. Labute himself reconfigures Han Suiyin's quote. It's not that "there is no morality in art", in the sense that morality should not apply to art, but more literally, that "there is now, no longer, morality in art". Artists have no ethical compass, social feeling or attachment toward world, community or fellowman. Such art doesn't only exist in a vacuum, but is inherently selfish and nihilistic. You know, like Chad. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Almost every line and every scene in this tight, aggressive film is purposeful. Aaron Eckhart's performance as Chad is relaxed, controlled, and indifferently sadistic without being brutal. Matt Malloy's performance as Howard is absolutely necessary to the success of the film. The audience is never supposed to respect Howard, and Malloy commits unflinchingly to the role. Howard, in the end, discovers that he has been purposelessly led by his own weakness to want vindication for his ego--instead, he becomes a pathetic imitation of a romantic hero for a moral purpose he pretended to ignore. Some of the script suffers from believability. The beginning of the film, when Howard is slapped for asking a woman the time, is pretty unreasonable. If the film is (even an implicit) argument that women provoke men to be cruel, it proceeds from a false premise. The story boils down to the simple logic that Chad can manipulate and destroy Howard because Howard believes he's able to manipulate and destroy someone else. I envision Chad as a kind of false Satan--a man who pretends to be against God and morality solely for the purpose of seducing and destroying the lives of characters who believe in him. "How does it feel to really hurt someone?"

    In the Company of Men is a movie that makes one consider his or her actions after watching. The film puts the human conscience to the test by illustrating an exaggerated example of how heartless people can be at times. The film centered around three main characters. Aaron Eckhart played Chad, the arrogant, back-stabbing and ruthless bad guy. Christine, played by Stacy Edwards, was the first of Chad's "victims" of cruelty. Matt Malloy played Howard, a man who thought Chad was his friend. In early portions of the film, the theme appears to be revenge upon women by scorned men. However, as the plot thickens, the true theme of the film reveals itself. It turns out that Chad is planning to hurt anyone he can. The real theme of the film is that some people care about only themselves. Chad is a classic case of one of those people. Throughout the film, he carefully executes a plan to hurt Christine, a deaf woman who has not dated in a long time, due to her handicap. He uses Howard to help in the act of hurting Christine. Chad eventually accomplishes his main goal. However, Howard develops feelings for Christine and tells her that he and Chad had set out to hurt her from the beginning. He also tells her that he has fallen in love with her, although she never gives him a chance to prove that. As a result, Howard ends up being hurt as well. As the plan to hurt Christine comes to fruition, other subplots become evident. Smaller examples of the theme come to light. Chad organizes a series of events that lead to Howard being demoted from his position in the company he and Chad work for. It was no coincidence that Chad eventually was promoted to Howard's position. As the viewer watches Chad's plans unfold, certain elements of film production can be detected as enhancers of the theme. For example, the music between scenes is bold and loud. It gives one the impression that something ominous is going to happen. The music seems to create an element of building tension. One anticipates a huge event of a bad nature. The camera angles chosen for many of the scenes make Chad seem very powerful and evil. The scenes that use upward views of Chad and Howard together are particularly persuasive toward creating this impression. The various angles used in the date scenes between Chad and Christine further emphasize Chad's lack of conscience. The theme of this film, and the execution of the theme, is very similar to that found in The Usual Suspects. Both films focus on a character that is deceiving people purposely. They are also similar, in that the "villain" is not found out by the other characters until the end of the movie. The only difference is that Chad is not so eager to get away clean with his acts. He seems to be proud of his actions, and willingly tells Howard what he has done. This film's theme is one that makes some consider their actions, while it makes others strive to achieve such power. The effect it has on you should say something about the kind of person you are. It made me consider how awful it feels to be hurt. Those involved in making this film have put together a powerful piece that, while lacking in action, forces people to examine themselves and others.

    Misogynist Film of the Moment: In the Company of Men 3 11 2009 I just watched one of the worst movies ever. I share my opinion only because I want you to watch it as well and see if you relate or if you are repulsed. Some of you might've seen it before. The title sounded familiar and its for that reason that I let the movie take my evening away from me. There was an award given to the filmmaker. It was released in 1997. I usually don't blast movies because they are supposed to leave you in a mood. The director and writer don't do a good job of portraying the comedy to this dark comedy though, and as a result it comes off as a serious film, and leaves a bad taste in the viewers mouth. Do not let your girlfriends watch this movie. It will only add to the man hate already happening. This is fuel to the fire. That said, if you do watch it, try to figure out which of the two guys you are more like, Chad or Howard, and get back at me. I might have to start a new column where I share these discoveries with you. This is an insult to misogynists everywhere. Not approved. In The Company Of Men ----Ryan Mega sexdrugsmoney.com

    Chad is a perfect example of a sociopath/psychopath, someone who is amoral, takes risks in his personal and work life, is utterly charming when he is working on someone, but cold and and cruel when he no longer needs them. I thought this film was a brilliant portrayal of the psychopath and how he draws in his victims. Lying is second nature to him, he takes everything in his stride because he has no emotional response to anything that transpires. Chad is in control and it is almost hypnotic to see him manipulate those around him. There was another thread running through the story, the office politics, and Howard appeared to have missed what was really happening - just like a real life victim, he would not have realised just how evil Chad is. Definitely one for my collection of films about psychos.

    I remember seeing In the Company of Men a very long time agoÂ…not sure exactly when, but it was when I began noticing independent films verses big budgeted all-name films. And I loved it. It was a refreshing change from explosions every few minutes. Unfortunately, times have changed. Yeah, I still like the film Â– I am a sucker for "super-human" characters, and Chad (Eckhart) certainly is. But, now my eyes opened, recently, to pacing and movies that overstay their welcomes. Don't give up on this movie, however. It's a somewhat original idea with excellent acting from Eckhart as an, excuse my English, asshole whose main purpose is to see people suffer for mere amusement. Here we have two "gentlemen," Howard (Malloy) and Chad who work together Â– one being the boss, though they graduated close to each other, and are sent for six weeks to an undisclosed city to set up their sales business. In a little down time Â– as few and far between it is, Howard admits to his buddy that he's been recently dumped by his girlfriend. Chad retorts with his story of love-lost with his girlfriend and then proposes the idea of the movie: revenge against women. Chad wants to find that special nobody, and have both him and Howard date her, romance her, make her feel like she's on top of the world and then simply pull the rug out and laugh as she falls. Sounds cruel? Well, yeahÂ…there's no other way to describe it. However, it gets worse; the one they pick, Christine (Edwards) is deaf. They do what they set out to. But, unfortunately for the movie's sake: they make it painfully obvious that one will fall (for her,) one will rise and the end result is what you expect. What holds the movie together and makes it worth a viewing is Eckhart as Chad. He's evil. He's borderline Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct) but he's somewhat more despicable than Stone, because he makes this all the more real. Also, they both smoke like a chimneyÂ…not that it's relevant Â– it's just probably thrown in as "you simply can't trust a smoker" I'm assuming. In addition, the end revolutions, when both Chad Â– who explains his motivations, and Howard who, well, shouts his, also make it worthy of a complete viewing. And finally: Edwards who plays Christine, is really NOT deaf in real life, so her acting and "speech" is truly impressive. Listen to the audio commentary. This is real acting. It's not fast paced and it's based on the stereotypical movie "lie" approach that always leads to the clich&eacute; revolutionary scene, but it's interesting as a "yeah, this could really happen" story and the actual climax is quite fulfilling. Eckhart is so good in this role; you almost root for him, despite his evil intentions. The writing is good enough to see he did place his pieces (people) in the exact locations he wanted them and that's not pulled off by most actors. I do love super-human characters that use people as pawns. Stone did it brilliantly in Basic Instinct and Eckhart proved he could almost (give it about 80%) match her. Only, some of his scenes Â– such as, show me your balls Â– were a little off-kilter. As was his character.

    Engrossing and fascinating, if uncompromisingly nasty, film from provocateur Neil LaBute. Two businessmen, one alpha male, the other paunchy wimp, play with the emotions of a deaf coworker as a way to vent their own frustrations about work, sex -- and just about everything else about being human. The resulting film is angry and predictably uncomfortable to watch, but the compelling writing and performances are enough to keep you engaged. This was the first film to introduce me to the considerable talents of Aaron Eckhart, a chronically underrated actor. Grade: A-

    Early in the movie the premise of the story line is made clear. Two Yuppie businessmen away on a project in a branch office are discussing their relationships with women. They tell each other how badly they have treated them and how downtrodden they feel. This leads one of them to come up with a plan, which he convinces the other fellow to join in with him. They will find unsuspecting, susceptible young woman during the six weeks that are away. They will each wine, dine and romance her simultaneously and then both will dump her and leave town. As one of them puts it, in the future no matter how badly they are treated by girlfriends, their wives or even their bosses, they will look back and know that nobody treated them as badly as they were going to treat this women. Nice guys? Now what does this movie show us? What insight into the human mind or into the mind of some subtype of men can we glean? Well, they carry out the plan albeit with some complications. When she realizes what was done to her, the young woman says to one of the men, "Why did you do this?" He answers, "Because I could?" Does that line sound familiar? Although the line became famous a few years after this movie was made Bill Clinton is the person who immortalized those words in response to a question from Dan Rather in a 60 Minute TV interview as to why he had his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton replied, "I think I did something for the worst possible reason-just because I could. I think that's the most, just about the most morally indefensible reason that anybody could have for doing anything. When you do something just because you couldÂ… I've thought about it a lot. And there are lots of more sophisticated explanations, more complicated psychological explanations. But none of them are an excuse." Those psychological reasons may vary from person to person and there were two male characters in the movie and of course Clinton is a character himself. In some there is a core of self-centeredness or narcissism, some of which may make you a good leader or a boss but too much of it will be a disaster. Then in some individuals there is a great insecurity, which can include jealousy and aggression. We saw a mixture of these in our characters in the movie. Director Neil LaBute made the six week time span move quickly and actors Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy were excellent. Although the performance of Stacy Edwards was also top notch, there was controversy in some circles who thought that a real deaf actress should have played the part. We should have mentioned that the susceptible attractive young women who was to be dumped had lost her hearing at age 8 and had a speech impairment. Some may find this movie very thought provoking. Hopefully it won't be too close to home.

    Here we have corporate culture at its worst in the 90s; two men, a decade out of college, going city to city and making their money by giving presentations and telling others what to do. It's a high-pressure job with what appears to be small reward. Both Chad and Howard are slowly becoming fed up as they see younger men rise quicker and with less work ethic; they see their wives and girlfriends leave them without warning, breaking their hearts as their souls are destroyed in the workplace. It has become too much for Chad and he is looking for revenge. What better way to do so than at the demise of a girl, the fairer sex in which he says is composed of women "all the same, meat and gristle and hatred just simmering"? What if they could lead on some poor soul who has reached a point in her life where the prospect of a relationship or a future full of love is unattainable and than destroy her for sport to watch the reaction? Hell, they'll always be able to tell each other afterwards, "They never got me the way we got her". The writing is cynical and witty; this is one of the blackest comedies you will ever view. I literally felt bad laughing at times, but it is constructed so smartly, you just can't help yourself. Howard is a wormy romantic who knows Chad, the epitome of alpha male, from college and has stayed close through the years. He would never partake in a game such as this if not for the tale of his stronger buddy being cleaned out by his girl, even having the frame around his American Gigolo poster taken from him. If the sort of heartbreak Howard feels can happen to his friend too, well than maybe the female race deserves to be taught a lesson; unfortunately for temp Christine, that exercise will be brought upon her in full. She is the perfect fodder for their six week revenge plan, not only is she attractive, but she is deaf. Handicapped to the point where she wears headphones to appear distracted when unable to hear someone walk by, she is so far removed from the dating scene that the advances of two successful men in the office may just be too strong for her to pass up. Both men work together to show her so much affection that she will have to fall for at least one. Love, however, wasn't anticipated to play a role in the proceedings. As the weeks advance, the dates become more intimate, the bonds stronger. Sitting and watching the advancement starts to make it tough to discern true motivations. Are Chad and Howard really falling for her or are they that good at pretending in order to make the breakup as devastating as possible? Howard may not be getting as close physically to the girl, but his actions express a longing and need to be with her. Chad, on the other hand, working his magic and getting her in bed, has acquired the phrase he's been working towards, having her tell him she loves him. He responds in kind, but is it real? We will have to wait and see in week six whether the game has gone too far or whether it has gone just as planned. That statement may seem cruel, because the fact the ruse began at all means it went too farÂ—they are playing with an innocent's emotions and heart for sportÂ—but in the context of the film, you do start to buy into it and want to see what kind of fallout will result. LaBute does come from the stage and it shows here in his first film as most scenes are constructed from long takes and static setups. One moment on the rooftop has Chad almost flub a line, but they keep going, either to keep a sense of realism or save money on reshooting the exchange. Definitely shot on the cheap, it becomes the job of the actors to perform at the highest level, and they do not disappoint. Stacy Edwards is amazing as Christine, both in her portrayal of a deaf woman and in the emotional turmoil she must go through from start to finish. Also remember too, see is deceiving them by going out with both at the same time, selfishly keeping her own happiness above them knowing the truth. But it is Matt Malloy and Aaron Eckhart, as Howard and Chad respectively, that really carry the film. Malloy is a ball of nerves and insecurities, yet when he needs to be, either lying to the girl or venting to his friend, can compose himself to a man of power and force. Needing incentive to be confident, it is in him, but the moments where his insecurities rear their head shine above all else; never able to control the situation, he slowly devolves into a version of Chad. Chad, conversely, doesn't have a weak bone to his name. He says at the end that he can sell anyone, and it is true. The lines he utters are pure gold and I can see why it was hard for him to get work early in his career. Eckhart played a prick so well, no one wanted the controversy surrounding this role to take anything away from the new work. He is so conniving, so manipulative, yet with a smile that can charm us all. This film exists due to his performance and the revelations at the conclusion only cement him as one of the best screen villains ever. I'd love to see this story on stage, because The Shape of Things blew away its brilliant screen counterpart when I saw a college production, and I can only imagine watching this acted out in front of me would do the same if not more.

    After watching "In The Company of Men" it left me with an awful taste in my mouth. But at the same time it was a great movie watching experience as we examine the more lower depths of how inhumane we can really be as a society and yet still somehow manage to get with doing our actions. The strange irony is that this film runs at very unreasonable levels. The two leading male characters are couple of hateful humans that it in-spite of their wicked demeanour, I still seemed quite intrigued as what will transpire between these characters. Neil LaBute who wrote and directed this film gave freedom to the movie to just let things flow and avoids it from being preachy or overly moralizing. To me it makes this comedy all the more darker and at the same time more effective too. This tale focuses on a businessman named Chard (Aaron Eckhart), who without hesitation brutally confesses to his friend Howard (Matt Malloy) how much he despises all that is female. So then Chard persuades Howard into a scheming plot in which they're lead on a vulnerable woman and eventually when all is said and done, he will dump her. Chad's reason is a vicious plot at revenge due to the ways women have treated men. Chad assumes that their six-week hiatus to a satellite office is the perfect facility to carry this cruel scheme and while at that take the time to make a mockery on this poor victim at her expense. Howard himself goes along with the scheme feeling that this master-plan will backfire and through self-obligation, sides with Chad to see what will transpire. The plan starts to materialize as the lab rat for this scheme is a naive, shy secretary named Christine (Stacy Edwards) who works at the satellite office who is also deaf. The whole film, Chad and Howard take turns charming Christine, while that's progressing, their scheme starts to get out of control and takes its turns in expected turn of events. The manipulative schemes the men have on poor Christine are very deceitful that it's hard to watch at times. In the case of Chad, the plot is an attempt to emerge victorious as a ploy to further express his disdain to the female gender. Howard feels this scheme is unlawful, it more like to be aware of what's inside looking out instead of vice-versa. The audience and even Hoawrd himself know this plot will not work out. In most movies and T.V. shows they never do. But it's still intriguing in how this plan will come crashing down on them. And we hope that there might be a small fragment of humanity between Chad and Howard. Sure the outcome is predictable, but it's still fun to watch how it will backfire. The reason for dark comedy isn't the jokes or the action by the leading stars, but the laughter rests in the vicinity of what lengths people will go to to express how hateful we as human race truly are. The character-driven film scores high points in terms of depth. In addition to that it makes us reconsider our actions by what we say and do I'm glad that Mr. LaBute ended the film with a moral lesson or a perfectly wrapped happy ending. In the end in this case, the antagonist comes out the winner. And in the real world, bad people usually end up victorious in many situations. Granted Chad is a handsome individual and can wow the ladies with his charm quite easily. But at the same time time he's hypocritical, obnoxious and quite the condescending person who looks a nice person you want to punch in the mouth with. But he is still easy to identify with. There are a lot of Chad's out there And yet you feel sick to your stomach because you understand the psyche of this character so in the end I'm the jerk that has the egg on his face. The whole Chad, Howard and Christine love factor has some noteworthy things of interest here. You have two to put it loosely gentlemen of contrasting backgrounds. You have Chad, the handsome, suave ladies man, and then you have Howard who comes across as socially awkward who like most people of his kind in society are the one's who never come out on top (me included). And it's obvious Christine chooses the suave one over the awkward one. Matt Malloy was excellent portraying Howard. At fist he come across as an introverted individual. However, in the pivotal scenes in the end, it's a breath of fresh air when he lashes out when his buttons are pushed. Once the dust settles, we find these two jerks madly in love with Christine being the unlucky victim due to her being deaf. Both fall victim to the metaphoric love potion. Chad is at a loss of words to admit he loves her while Howard feels short that lost in a situation where he should have won. But in spite of the shortcomings within the characters, it is a wonderful character-driven story that might be hard to swallow in some situations.

    Neil Labute's "In The Company of Men" stars Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy as Chad and Howard, a pair of mid-level corporate executives sent to a boring regional branch for six weeks on a short term project. Frustrated, recently burnt by women, stuck in a career rut and high on corporate testosterone, the duo hatch a plan. "Let's hurt somebody," alpha-male Chad says. Pretty soon they're cooking up a Machiavellian scheme to locate an insecure woman, date her simultaneously, and dump her in the most vicious way possible. The woman they set their sights on is handicapped co-worker Christine. Christine has a speech impediment, but what she says doesn't matter to Chad anyway. Denied a voice, Chad handles her like an object to be acquired, traded, owned and discarded. Labute is heavily influenced by David Mamet. Most of the film finds Chad spewing corporate maxims, strutting about like a Master of the Universe and forcing co-workers to grovel at his feet. Eventually its revealed that Chad's scheming extends even to his "friend" Howard. He's your classic Extreme Sociopath, charming but endlessly manipulative. Everyone's his puppet. And as with Mamet's "workplace flicks", Chad's less a character than an extreme manifestation of a corporate logic whose drive for profit, ownership and expansion slowly infects how everyone around him thinks, acts and feels. Eventually Chad becomes both a norm and standard to aspire to. He's the new hypermasculinist ideal, for whom humiliation, domination, degradation, exploitation and suffering conflate with success. It's not only that aggressive competition in business affects masculinity, romance and sexual behaviour, but that corporate logic magnifies power, the ego and sanctions what is essentially various forms of rape. This stance is the opposite of how contemporary ideology is (mis)perceived, in which "business" is seen to be "neutral" and "mutually beneficial". Chad's a character who's popped up in many films and stories. More interesting is Howard, a fairly meek guy who is corrupted and made to do things even more horrible than Chad. The real world is made up of Howards. Chad's the anomaly, existing always more as spirit or underlying drive. La Bute penned "The Shape of Things" as an attempt to reverse the gender roles of "Company". Arguably his best film, it's also part of a tight trilogy by Labute about people's perceptions of physicality ("Fat Pig", "Reasons to be Pretty", "Shape of Things"). Massive spoilers ahead. "The Shape of Things" initially unfolds like a conventional romantic comedy. We're introduced to a dishevelled English Literature student called Adam, played by the always likable Paul Rudd, and an attractive art student called Evelyn (Rachel Weisz). The film then becomes a modern version of Adam's seduction by Eve. Eve ensnares Adam, manipulates him into becoming "fit", "attractive" and "healthy", and then reveals that she has never had romantic feelings toward him; she was merely using Adam as a sort of living art installation, a clay puppet, deceptively sculpting and moulding his mind and body. When Eve reveals her scheme to Adam Â– she invites him to an art installation in which he is quite literally presented as an exhibited object, her gaze now likened to the masculinist gaze of "In The Company of Men" - he's dumbfounded. Eve's tricked him into getting cosmetic surgery and altering his personality and physique. She's reconstructed him. Treated him as a chunk of malleable flesh. Unlike "Company", we're then invited to work our way through the messy ethical minefield of the victimiser's actions. For while Chad deservedly gets no sympathy in "Company", the relationship in "Things" is much harder to work out. Is Adam now a better person? Was Eve's love, no matter how virtual, beneficial to Adam? Was it ever real? How much authority should be given, or do we give, to artists? How much ethical responsibility do they hold or exercise? How do power relationships within romantic couples overlap with the power we grant artists? Don't Eve's actions echo the sexism of "Compny"? What is acceptable artistic material? Do the means, in art, justify the ends? At what point does creation become manipulation, is manipulation ever justified and at what point does creation destroy (see "Vertigo")? Is Adam now a beautiful work of "art" despite Eve's actions? How do Eve's actions differ from other vampiric artists, who take from and/or abuse outside sources? What does the film say about romance and the lover's desire to alter their partner? Art may be made by monsters, but what about the audience who enjoys? And on and on it goes. The film features a shot of the sentence "There is no morality in art". The quote's by Chinese novelist Han Suiyin, and is stencilled over Eve's art gallery. Throughout the film Eve articulates a similarly postmodern stance: "it's all subjective", she says, "moralists have no place in an art gallery". The firm itself is structured, we think, as an artist's apologia. Its first scene portrays Eve as an iconoclast who thrice breaks the rules, stepping over a rope at a museum, taking an illegal photograph of a sculpture and painting a penis onto a statue which has been censored by uptight museum curators. "You stepped over the line, Miss," curator Adam prophetically says when he firsts meets her. But as Eve makes clear, there should be no lines. We agree with her for much of the film. Afterall, hasn't she liberated Adam? By the film's end, however, we're asked to reconsider Eve's stance. Labute himself reconfigures Han Suiyin's quote. It's not that "there is no morality in art", in the sense that morality should not apply to art, but more literally, that "there is now, no longer, morality in art". Artists have no ethical compass, social feeling or attachment toward world, community or fellowman. Such art doesn't only exist in a vacuum, but is inherently selfish and nihilistic. You know, like Chad. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Almost every line and every scene in this tight, aggressive film is purposeful. Aaron Eckhart's performance as Chad is relaxed, controlled, and indifferently sadistic without being brutal. Matt Malloy's performance as Howard is absolutely necessary to the success of the film. The audience is never supposed to respect Howard, and Malloy commits unflinchingly to the role. Howard, in the end, discovers that he has been purposelessly led by his own weakness to want vindication for his ego--instead, he becomes a pathetic imitation of a romantic hero for a moral purpose he pretended to ignore. Some of the script suffers from believability. The beginning of the film, when Howard is slapped for asking a woman the time, is pretty unreasonable. If the film is (even an implicit) argument that women provoke men to be cruel, it proceeds from a false premise. The story boils down to the simple logic that Chad can manipulate and destroy Howard because Howard believes he's able to manipulate and destroy someone else. I envision Chad as a kind of false Satan--a man who pretends to be against God and morality solely for the purpose of seducing and destroying the lives of characters who believe in him. "How does it feel to really hurt someone?"

    In the Company of Men is a movie that makes one consider his or her actions after watching. The film puts the human conscience to the test by illustrating an exaggerated example of how heartless people can be at times. The film centered around three main characters. Aaron Eckhart played Chad, the arrogant, back-stabbing and ruthless bad guy. Christine, played by Stacy Edwards, was the first of Chad's "victims" of cruelty. Matt Malloy played Howard, a man who thought Chad was his friend. In early portions of the film, the theme appears to be revenge upon women by scorned men. However, as the plot thickens, the true theme of the film reveals itself. It turns out that Chad is planning to hurt anyone he can. The real theme of the film is that some people care about only themselves. Chad is a classic case of one of those people. Throughout the film, he carefully executes a plan to hurt Christine, a deaf woman who has not dated in a long time, due to her handicap. He uses Howard to help in the act of hurting Christine. Chad eventually accomplishes his main goal. However, Howard develops feelings for Christine and tells her that he and Chad had set out to hurt her from the beginning. He also tells her that he has fallen in love with her, although she never gives him a chance to prove that. As a result, Howard ends up being hurt as well. As the plan to hurt Christine comes to fruition, other subplots become evident. Smaller examples of the theme come to light. Chad organizes a series of events that lead to Howard being demoted from his position in the company he and Chad work for. It was no coincidence that Chad eventually was promoted to Howard's position. As the viewer watches Chad's plans unfold, certain elements of film production can be detected as enhancers of the theme. For example, the music between scenes is bold and loud. It gives one the impression that something ominous is going to happen. The music seems to create an element of building tension. One anticipates a huge event of a bad nature. The camera angles chosen for many of the scenes make Chad seem very powerful and evil. The scenes that use upward views of Chad and Howard together are particularly persuasive toward creating this impression. The various angles used in the date scenes between Chad and Christine further emphasize Chad's lack of conscience. The theme of this film, and the execution of the theme, is very similar to that found in The Usual Suspects. Both films focus on a character that is deceiving people purposely. They are also similar, in that the "villain" is not found out by the other characters until the end of the movie. The only difference is that Chad is not so eager to get away clean with his acts. He seems to be proud of his actions, and willingly tells Howard what he has done. This film's theme is one that makes some consider their actions, while it makes others strive to achieve such power. The effect it has on you should say something about the kind of person you are. It made me consider how awful it feels to be hurt. Those involved in making this film have put together a powerful piece that, while lacking in action, forces people to examine themselves and others.

    Misogynist Film of the Moment: In the Company of Men 3 11 2009 I just watched one of the worst movies ever. I share my opinion only because I want you to watch it as well and see if you relate or if you are repulsed. Some of you might've seen it before. The title sounded familiar and its for that reason that I let the movie take my evening away from me. There was an award given to the filmmaker. It was released in 1997. I usually don't blast movies because they are supposed to leave you in a mood. The director and writer don't do a good job of portraying the comedy to this dark comedy though, and as a result it comes off as a serious film, and leaves a bad taste in the viewers mouth. Do not let your girlfriends watch this movie. It will only add to the man hate already happening. This is fuel to the fire. That said, if you do watch it, try to figure out which of the two guys you are more like, Chad or Howard, and get back at me. I might have to start a new column where I share these discoveries with you. This is an insult to misogynists everywhere. Not approved. In The Company Of Men ----Ryan Mega sexdrugsmoney.com

    Chad is a perfect example of a sociopath/psychopath, someone who is amoral, takes risks in his personal and work life, is utterly charming when he is working on someone, but cold and and cruel when he no longer needs them. I thought this film was a brilliant portrayal of the psychopath and how he draws in his victims. Lying is second nature to him, he takes everything in his stride because he has no emotional response to anything that transpires. Chad is in control and it is almost hypnotic to see him manipulate those around him. There was another thread running through the story, the office politics, and Howard appeared to have missed what was really happening - just like a real life victim, he would not have realised just how evil Chad is. Definitely one for my collection of films about psychos.

    I remember seeing In the Company of Men a very long time agoÂ…not sure exactly when, but it was when I began noticing independent films verses big budgeted all-name films. And I loved it. It was a refreshing change from explosions every few minutes. Unfortunately, times have changed. Yeah, I still like the film Â– I am a sucker for "super-human" characters, and Chad (Eckhart) certainly is. But, now my eyes opened, recently, to pacing and movies that overstay their welcomes. Don't give up on this movie, however. It's a somewhat original idea with excellent acting from Eckhart as an, excuse my English, asshole whose main purpose is to see people suffer for mere amusement. Here we have two "gentlemen," Howard (Malloy) and Chad who work together Â– one being the boss, though they graduated close to each other, and are sent for six weeks to an undisclosed city to set up their sales business. In a little down time Â– as few and far between it is, Howard admits to his buddy that he's been recently dumped by his girlfriend. Chad retorts with his story of love-lost with his girlfriend and then proposes the idea of the movie: revenge against women. Chad wants to find that special nobody, and have both him and Howard date her, romance her, make her feel like she's on top of the world and then simply pull the rug out and laugh as she falls. Sounds cruel? Well, yeahÂ…there's no other way to describe it. However, it gets worse; the one they pick, Christine (Edwards) is deaf. They do what they set out to. But, unfortunately for the movie's sake: they make it painfully obvious that one will fall (for her,) one will rise and the end result is what you expect. What holds the movie together and makes it worth a viewing is Eckhart as Chad. He's evil. He's borderline Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct) but he's somewhat more despicable than Stone, because he makes this all the more real. Also, they both smoke like a chimneyÂ…not that it's relevant Â– it's just probably thrown in as "you simply can't trust a smoker" I'm assuming. In addition, the end revolutions, when both Chad Â– who explains his motivations, and Howard who, well, shouts his, also make it worthy of a complete viewing. And finally: Edwards who plays Christine, is really NOT deaf in real life, so her acting and "speech" is truly impressive. Listen to the audio commentary. This is real acting. It's not fast paced and it's based on the stereotypical movie "lie" approach that always leads to the clich&eacute; revolutionary scene, but it's interesting as a "yeah, this could really happen" story and the actual climax is quite fulfilling. Eckhart is so good in this role; you almost root for him, despite his evil intentions. The writing is good enough to see he did place his pieces (people) in the exact locations he wanted them and that's not pulled off by most actors. I do love super-human characters that use people as pawns. Stone did it brilliantly in Basic Instinct and Eckhart proved he could almost (give it about 80%) match her. Only, some of his scenes Â– such as, show me your balls Â– were a little off-kilter. As was his character.

    Engrossing and fascinating, if uncompromisingly nasty, film from provocateur Neil LaBute. Two businessmen, one alpha male, the other paunchy wimp, play with the emotions of a deaf coworker as a way to vent their own frustrations about work, sex -- and just about everything else about being human. The resulting film is angry and predictably uncomfortable to watch, but the compelling writing and performances are enough to keep you engaged. This was the first film to introduce me to the considerable talents of Aaron Eckhart, a chronically underrated actor. Grade: A-

    Early in the movie the premise of the story line is made clear. Two Yuppie businessmen away on a project in a branch office are discussing their relationships with women. They tell each other how badly they have treated them and how downtrodden they feel. This leads one of them to come up with a plan, which he convinces the other fellow to join in with him. They will find unsuspecting, susceptible young woman during the six weeks that are away. They will each wine, dine and romance her simultaneously and then both will dump her and leave town. As one of them puts it, in the future no matter how badly they are treated by girlfriends, their wives or even their bosses, they will look back and know that nobody treated them as badly as they were going to treat this women. Nice guys? Now what does this movie show us? What insight into the human mind or into the mind of some subtype of men can we glean? Well, they carry out the plan albeit with some complications. When she realizes what was done to her, the young woman says to one of the men, "Why did you do this?" He answers, "Because I could?" Does that line sound familiar? Although the line became famous a few years after this movie was made Bill Clinton is the person who immortalized those words in response to a question from Dan Rather in a 60 Minute TV interview as to why he had his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton replied, "I think I did something for the worst possible reason-just because I could. I think that's the most, just about the most morally indefensible reason that anybody could have for doing anything. When you do something just because you couldÂ… I've thought about it a lot. And there are lots of more sophisticated explanations, more complicated psychological explanations. But none of them are an excuse." Those psychological reasons may vary from person to person and there were two male characters in the movie and of course Clinton is a character himself. In some there is a core of self-centeredness or narcissism, some of which may make you a good leader or a boss but too much of it will be a disaster. Then in some individuals there is a great insecurity, which can include jealousy and aggression. We saw a mixture of these in our characters in the movie. Director Neil LaBute made the six week time span move quickly and actors Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy were excellent. Although the performance of Stacy Edwards was also top notch, there was controversy in some circles who thought that a real deaf actress should have played the part. We should have mentioned that the susceptible attractive young women who was to be dumped had lost her hearing at age 8 and had a speech impairment. Some may find this movie very thought provoking. Hopefully it won't be too close to home.

    Here we have corporate culture at its worst in the 90s; two men, a decade out of college, going city to city and making their money by giving presentations and telling others what to do. It's a high-pressure job with what appears to be small reward. Both Chad and Howard are slowly becoming fed up as they see younger men rise quicker and with less work ethic; they see their wives and girlfriends leave them without warning, breaking their hearts as their souls are destroyed in the workplace. It has become too much for Chad and he is looking for revenge. What better way to do so than at the demise of a girl, the fairer sex in which he says is composed of women "all the same, meat and gristle and hatred just simmering"? What if they could lead on some poor soul who has reached a point in her life where the prospect of a relationship or a future full of love is unattainable and than destroy her for sport to watch the reaction? Hell, they'll always be able to tell each other afterwards, "They never got me the way we got her". The writing is cynical and witty; this is one of the blackest comedies you will ever view. I literally felt bad laughing at times, but it is constructed so smartly, you just can't help yourself. Howard is a wormy romantic who knows Chad, the epitome of alpha male, from college and has stayed close through the years. He would never partake in a game such as this if not for the tale of his stronger buddy being cleaned out by his girl, even having the frame around his American Gigolo poster taken from him. If the sort of heartbreak Howard feels can happen to his friend too, well than maybe the female race deserves to be taught a lesson; unfortunately for temp Christine, that exercise will be brought upon her in full. She is the perfect fodder for their six week revenge plan, not only is she attractive, but she is deaf. Handicapped to the point where she wears headphones to appear distracted when unable to hear someone walk by, she is so far removed from the dating scene that the advances of two successful men in the office may just be too strong for her to pass up. Both men work together to show her so much affection that she will have to fall for at least one. Love, however, wasn't anticipated to play a role in the proceedings. As the weeks advance, the dates become more intimate, the bonds stronger. Sitting and watching the advancement starts to make it tough to discern true motivations. Are Chad and Howard really falling for her or are they that good at pretending in order to make the breakup as devastating as possible? Howard may not be getting as close physically to the girl, but his actions express a longing and need to be with her. Chad, on the other hand, working his magic and getting her in bed, has acquired the phrase he's been working towards, having her tell him she loves him. He responds in kind, but is it real? We will have to wait and see in week six whether the game has gone too far or whether it has gone just as planned. That statement may seem cruel, because the fact the ruse began at all means it went too farÂ—they are playing with an innocent's emotions and heart for sportÂ—but in the context of the film, you do start to buy into it and want to see what kind of fallout will result. LaBute does come from the stage and it shows here in his first film as most scenes are constructed from long takes and static setups. One moment on the rooftop has Chad almost flub a line, but they keep going, either to keep a sense of realism or save money on reshooting the exchange. Definitely shot on the cheap, it becomes the job of the actors to perform at the highest level, and they do not disappoint. Stacy Edwards is amazing as Christine, both in her portrayal of a deaf woman and in the emotional turmoil she must go through from start to finish. Also remember too, see is deceiving them by going out with both at the same time, selfishly keeping her own happiness above them knowing the truth. But it is Matt Malloy and Aaron Eckhart, as Howard and Chad respectively, that really carry the film. Malloy is a ball of nerves and insecurities, yet when he needs to be, either lying to the girl or venting to his friend, can compose himself to a man of power and force. Needing incentive to be confident, it is in him, but the moments where his insecurities rear their head shine above all else; never able to control the situation, he slowly devolves into a version of Chad. Chad, conversely, doesn't have a weak bone to his name. He says at the end that he can sell anyone, and it is true. The lines he utters are pure gold and I can see why it was hard for him to get work early in his career. Eckhart played a prick so well, no one wanted the controversy surrounding this role to take anything away from the new work. He is so conniving, so manipulative, yet with a smile that can charm us all. This film exists due to his performance and the revelations at the conclusion only cement him as one of the best screen villains ever. I'd love to see this story on stage, because The Shape of Things blew away its brilliant screen counterpart when I saw a college production, and I can only imagine watching this acted out in front of me would do the same if not more.

    After watching "In The Company of Men" it left me with an awful taste in my mouth. But at the same time it was a great movie watching experience as we examine the more lower depths of how inhumane we can really be as a society and yet still somehow manage to get with doing our actions. The strange irony is that this film runs at very unreasonable levels. The two leading male characters are couple of hateful humans that it in-spite of their wicked demeanour, I still seemed quite intrigued as what will transpire between these characters. Neil LaBute who wrote and directed this film gave freedom to the movie to just let things flow and avoids it from being preachy or overly moralizing. To me it makes this comedy all the more darker and at the same time more effective too. This tale focuses on a businessman named Chard (Aaron Eckhart), who without hesitation brutally confesses to his friend Howard (Matt Malloy) how much he despises all that is female. So then Chard persuades Howard into a scheming plot in which they're lead on a vulnerable woman and eventually when all is said and done, he will dump her. Chad's reason is a vicious plot at revenge due to the ways women have treated men. Chad assumes that their six-week hiatus to a satellite office is the perfect facility to carry this cruel scheme and while at that take the time to make a mockery on this poor victim at her expense. Howard himself goes along with the scheme feeling that this master-plan will backfire and through self-obligation, sides with Chad to see what will transpire. The plan starts to materialize as the lab rat for this scheme is a naive, shy secretary named Christine (Stacy Edwards) who works at the satellite office who is also deaf. The whole film, Chad and Howard take turns charming Christine, while that's progressing, their scheme starts to get out of control and takes its turns in expected turn of events. The manipulative schemes the men have on poor Christine are very deceitful that it's hard to watch at times. In the case of Chad, the plot is an attempt to emerge victorious as a ploy to further express his disdain to the female gender. Howard feels this scheme is unlawful, it more like to be aware of what's inside looking out instead of vice-versa. The audience and even Hoawrd himself know this plot will not work out. In most movies and T.V. shows they never do. But it's still intriguing in how this plan will come crashing down on them. And we hope that there might be a small fragment of humanity between Chad and Howard. Sure the outcome is predictable, but it's still fun to watch how it will backfire. The reason for dark comedy isn't the jokes or the action by the leading stars, but the laughter rests in the vicinity of what lengths people will go to to express how hateful we as human race truly are. The character-driven film scores high points in terms of depth. In addition to that it makes us reconsider our actions by what we say and do I'm glad that Mr. LaBute ended the film with a moral lesson or a perfectly wrapped happy ending. In the end in this case, the antagonist comes out the winner. And in the real world, bad people usually end up victorious in many situations. Granted Chad is a handsome individual and can wow the ladies with his charm quite easily. But at the same time time he's hypocritical, obnoxious and quite the condescending person who looks a nice person you want to punch in the mouth with. But he is still easy to identify with. There are a lot of Chad's out there And yet you feel sick to your stomach because you understand the psyche of this character so in the end I'm the jerk that has the egg on his face. The whole Chad, Howard and Christine love factor has some noteworthy things of interest here. You have two to put it loosely gentlemen of contrasting backgrounds. You have Chad, the handsome, suave ladies man, and then you have Howard who comes across as socially awkward who like most people of his kind in society are the one's who never come out on top (me included). And it's obvious Christine chooses the suave one over the awkward one. Matt Malloy was excellent portraying Howard. At fist he come across as an introverted individual. However, in the pivotal scenes in the end, it's a breath of fresh air when he lashes out when his buttons are pushed. Once the dust settles, we find these two jerks madly in love with Christine being the unlucky victim due to her being deaf. Both fall victim to the metaphoric love potion. Chad is at a loss of words to admit he loves her while Howard feels short that lost in a situation where he should have won. But in spite of the shortcomings within the characters, it is a wonderful character-driven story that might be hard to swallow in some situations.

    Neil Labute's "In The Company of Men" stars Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy as Chad and Howard, a pair of mid-level corporate executives sent to a boring regional branch for six weeks on a short term project. Frustrated, recently burnt by women, stuck in a career rut and high on corporate testosterone, the duo hatch a plan. "Let's hurt somebody," alpha-male Chad says. Pretty soon they're cooking up a Machiavellian scheme to locate an insecure woman, date her simultaneously, and dump her in the most vicious way possible. The woman they set their sights on is handicapped co-worker Christine. Christine has a speech impediment, but what she says doesn't matter to Chad anyway. Denied a voice, Chad handles her like an object to be acquired, traded, owned and discarded. Labute is heavily influenced by David Mamet. Most of the film finds Chad spewing corporate maxims, strutting about like a Master of the Universe and forcing co-workers to grovel at his feet. Eventually its revealed that Chad's scheming extends even to his "friend" Howard. He's your classic Extreme Sociopath, charming but endlessly manipulative. Everyone's his puppet. And as with Mamet's "workplace flicks", Chad's less a character than an extreme manifestation of a corporate logic whose drive for profit, ownership and expansion slowly infects how everyone around him thinks, acts and feels. Eventually Chad becomes both a norm and standard to aspire to. He's the new hypermasculinist ideal, for whom humiliation, domination, degradation, exploitation and suffering conflate with success. It's not only that aggressive competition in business affects masculinity, romance and sexual behaviour, but that corporate logic magnifies power, the ego and sanctions what is essentially various forms of rape. This stance is the opposite of how contemporary ideology is (mis)perceived, in which "business" is seen to be "neutral" and "mutually beneficial". Chad's a character who's popped up in many films and stories. More interesting is Howard, a fairly meek guy who is corrupted and made to do things even more horrible than Chad. The real world is made up of Howards. Chad's the anomaly, existing always more as spirit or underlying drive. La Bute penned "The Shape of Things" as an attempt to reverse the gender roles of "Company". Arguably his best film, it's also part of a tight trilogy by Labute about people's perceptions of physicality ("Fat Pig", "Reasons to be Pretty", "Shape of Things"). Massive spoilers ahead. "The Shape of Things" initially unfolds like a conventional romantic comedy. We're introduced to a dishevelled English Literature student called Adam, played by the always likable Paul Rudd, and an attractive art student called Evelyn (Rachel Weisz). The film then becomes a modern version of Adam's seduction by Eve. Eve ensnares Adam, manipulates him into becoming "fit", "attractive" and "healthy", and then reveals that she has never had romantic feelings toward him; she was merely using Adam as a sort of living art installation, a clay puppet, deceptively sculpting and moulding his mind and body. When Eve reveals her scheme to Adam Â– she invites him to an art installation in which he is quite literally presented as an exhibited object, her gaze now likened to the masculinist gaze of "In The Company of Men" - he's dumbfounded. Eve's tricked him into getting cosmetic surgery and altering his personality and physique. She's reconstructed him. Treated him as a chunk of malleable flesh. Unlike "Company", we're then invited to work our way through the messy ethical minefield of the victimiser's actions. For while Chad deservedly gets no sympathy in "Company", the relationship in "Things" is much harder to work out. Is Adam now a better person? Was Eve's love, no matter how virtual, beneficial to Adam? Was it ever real? How much authority should be given, or do we give, to artists? How much ethical responsibility do they hold or exercise? How do power relationships within romantic couples overlap with the power we grant artists? Don't Eve's actions echo the sexism of "Compny"? What is acceptable artistic material? Do the means, in art, justify the ends? At what point does creation become manipulation, is manipulation ever justified and at what point does creation destroy (see "Vertigo")? Is Adam now a beautiful work of "art" despite Eve's actions? How do Eve's actions differ from other vampiric artists, who take from and/or abuse outside sources? What does the film say about romance and the lover's desire to alter their partner? Art may be made by monsters, but what about the audience who enjoys? And on and on it goes. The film features a shot of the sentence "There is no morality in art". The quote's by Chinese novelist Han Suiyin, and is stencilled over Eve's art gallery. Throughout the film Eve articulates a similarly postmodern stance: "it's all subjective", she says, "moralists have no place in an art gallery". The firm itself is structured, we think, as an artist's apologia. Its first scene portrays Eve as an iconoclast who thrice breaks the rules, stepping over a rope at a museum, taking an illegal photograph of a sculpture and painting a penis onto a statue which has been censored by uptight museum curators. "You stepped over the line, Miss," curator Adam prophetically says when he firsts meets her. But as Eve makes clear, there should be no lines. We agree with her for much of the film. Afterall, hasn't she liberated Adam? By the film's end, however, we're asked to reconsider Eve's stance. Labute himself reconfigures Han Suiyin's quote. It's not that "there is no morality in art", in the sense that morality should not apply to art, but more literally, that "there is now, no longer, morality in art". Artists have no ethical compass, social feeling or attachment toward world, community or fellowman. Such art doesn't only exist in a vacuum, but is inherently selfish and nihilistic. You know, like Chad. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Almost every line and every scene in this tight, aggressive film is purposeful. Aaron Eckhart's performance as Chad is relaxed, controlled, and indifferently sadistic without being brutal. Matt Malloy's performance as Howard is absolutely necessary to the success of the film. The audience is never supposed to respect Howard, and Malloy commits unflinchingly to the role. Howard, in the end, discovers that he has been purposelessly led by his own weakness to want vindication for his ego--instead, he becomes a pathetic imitation of a romantic hero for a moral purpose he pretended to ignore. Some of the script suffers from believability. The beginning of the film, when Howard is slapped for asking a woman the time, is pretty unreasonable. If the film is (even an implicit) argument that women provoke men to be cruel, it proceeds from a false premise. The story boils down to the simple logic that Chad can manipulate and destroy Howard because Howard believes he's able to manipulate and destroy someone else. I envision Chad as a kind of false Satan--a man who pretends to be against God and morality solely for the purpose of seducing and destroying the lives of characters who believe in him. "How does it feel to really hurt someone?"

    In the Company of Men is a movie that makes one consider his or her actions after watching. The film puts the human conscience to the test by illustrating an exaggerated example of how heartless people can be at times. The film centered around three main characters. Aaron Eckhart played Chad, the arrogant, back-stabbing and ruthless bad guy. Christine, played by Stacy Edwards, was the first of Chad's "victims" of cruelty. Matt Malloy played Howard, a man who thought Chad was his friend. In early portions of the film, the theme appears to be revenge upon women by scorned men. However, as the plot thickens, the true theme of the film reveals itself. It turns out that Chad is planning to hurt anyone he can. The real theme of the film is that some people care about only themselves. Chad is a classic case of one of those people. Throughout the film, he carefully executes a plan to hurt Christine, a deaf woman who has not dated in a long time, due to her handicap. He uses Howard to help in the act of hurting Christine. Chad eventually accomplishes his main goal. However, Howard develops feelings for Christine and tells her that he and Chad had set out to hurt her from the beginning. He also tells her that he has fallen in love with her, although she never gives him a chance to prove that. As a result, Howard ends up being hurt as well. As the plan to hurt Christine comes to fruition, other subplots become evident. Smaller examples of the theme come to light. Chad organizes a series of events that lead to Howard being demoted from his position in the company he and Chad work for. It was no coincidence that Chad eventually was promoted to Howard's position. As the viewer watches Chad's plans unfold, certain elements of film production can be detected as enhancers of the theme. For example, the music between scenes is bold and loud. It gives one the impression that something ominous is going to happen. The music seems to create an element of building tension. One anticipates a huge event of a bad nature. The camera angles chosen for many of the scenes make Chad seem very powerful and evil. The scenes that use upward views of Chad and Howard together are particularly persuasive toward creating this impression. The various angles used in the date scenes between Chad and Christine further emphasize Chad's lack of conscience. The theme of this film, and the execution of the theme, is very similar to that found in The Usual Suspects. Both films focus on a character that is deceiving people purposely. They are also similar, in that the "villain" is not found out by the other characters until the end of the movie. The only difference is that Chad is not so eager to get away clean with his acts. He seems to be proud of his actions, and willingly tells Howard what he has done. This film's theme is one that makes some consider their actions, while it makes others strive to achieve such power. The effect it has on you should say something about the kind of person you are. It made me consider how awful it feels to be hurt. Those involved in making this film have put together a powerful piece that, while lacking in action, forces people to examine themselves and others.

    Misogynist Film of the Moment: In the Company of Men 3 11 2009 I just watched one of the worst movies ever. I share my opinion only because I want you to watch it as well and see if you relate or if you are repulsed. Some of you might've seen it before. The title sounded familiar and its for that reason that I let the movie take my evening away from me. There was an award given to the filmmaker. It was released in 1997. I usually don't blast movies because they are supposed to leave you in a mood. The director and writer don't do a good job of portraying the comedy to this dark comedy though, and as a result it comes off as a serious film, and leaves a bad taste in the viewers mouth. Do not let your girlfriends watch this movie. It will only add to the man hate already happening. This is fuel to the fire. That said, if you do watch it, try to figure out which of the two guys you are more like, Chad or Howard, and get back at me. I might have to start a new column where I share these discoveries with you. This is an insult to misogynists everywhere. Not approved. In The Company Of Men ----Ryan Mega sexdrugsmoney.com

    Chad is a perfect example of a sociopath/psychopath, someone who is amoral, takes risks in his personal and work life, is utterly charming when he is working on someone, but cold and and cruel when he no longer needs them. I thought this film was a brilliant portrayal of the psychopath and how he draws in his victims. Lying is second nature to him, he takes everything in his stride because he has no emotional response to anything that transpires. Chad is in control and it is almost hypnotic to see him manipulate those around him. There was another thread running through the story, the office politics, and Howard appeared to have missed what was really happening - just like a real life victim, he would not have realised just how evil Chad is. Definitely one for my collection of films about psychos.

    I remember seeing In the Company of Men a very long time agoÂ…not sure exactly when, but it was when I began noticing independent films verses big budgeted all-name films. And I loved it. It was a refreshing change from explosions every few minutes. Unfortunately, times have changed. Yeah, I still like the film Â– I am a sucker for "super-human" characters, and Chad (Eckhart) certainly is. But, now my eyes opened, recently, to pacing and movies that overstay their welcomes. Don't give up on this movie, however. It's a somewhat original idea with excellent acting from Eckhart as an, excuse my English, asshole whose main purpose is to see people suffer for mere amusement. Here we have two "gentlemen," Howard (Malloy) and Chad who work together Â– one being the boss, though they graduated close to each other, and are sent for six weeks to an undisclosed city to set up their sales business. In a little down time Â– as few and far between it is, Howard admits to his buddy that he's been recently dumped by his girlfriend. Chad retorts with his story of love-lost with his girlfriend and then proposes the idea of the movie: revenge against women. Chad wants to find that special nobody, and have both him and Howard date her, romance her, make her feel like she's on top of the world and then simply pull the rug out and laugh as she falls. Sounds cruel? Well, yeahÂ…there's no other way to describe it. However, it gets worse; the one they pick, Christine (Edwards) is deaf. They do what they set out to. But, unfortunately for the movie's sake: they make it painfully obvious that one will fall (for her,) one will rise and the end result is what you expect. What holds the movie together and makes it worth a viewing is Eckhart as Chad. He's evil. He's borderline Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct) but he's somewhat more despicable than Stone, because he makes this all the more real. Also, they both smoke like a chimneyÂ…not that it's relevant Â– it's just probably thrown in as "you simply can't trust a smoker" I'm assuming. In addition, the end revolutions, when both Chad Â– who explains his motivations, and Howard who, well, shouts his, also make it worthy of a complete viewing. And finally: Edwards who plays Christine, is really NOT deaf in real life, so her acting and "speech" is truly impressive. Listen to the audio commentary. This is real acting. It's not fast paced and it's based on the stereotypical movie "lie" approach that always leads to the clich&eacute; revolutionary scene, but it's interesting as a "yeah, this could really happen" story and the actual climax is quite fulfilling. Eckhart is so good in this role; you almost root for him, despite his evil intentions. The writing is good enough to see he did place his pieces (people) in the exact locations he wanted them and that's not pulled off by most actors. I do love super-human characters that use people as pawns. Stone did it brilliantly in Basic Instinct and Eckhart proved he could almost (give it about 80%) match her. Only, some of his scenes Â– such as, show me your balls Â– were a little off-kilter. As was his character.

    Engrossing and fascinating, if uncompromisingly nasty, film from provocateur Neil LaBute. Two businessmen, one alpha male, the other paunchy wimp, play with the emotions of a deaf coworker as a way to vent their own frustrations about work, sex -- and just about everything else about being human. The resulting film is angry and predictably uncomfortable to watch, but the compelling writing and performances are enough to keep you engaged. This was the first film to introduce me to the considerable talents of Aaron Eckhart, a chronically underrated actor. Grade: A-

    Early in the movie the premise of the story line is made clear. Two Yuppie businessmen away on a project in a branch office are discussing their relationships with women. They tell each other how badly they have treated them and how downtrodden they feel. This leads one of them to come up with a plan, which he convinces the other fellow to join in with him. They will find unsuspecting, susceptible young woman during the six weeks that are away. They will each wine, dine and romance her simultaneously and then both will dump her and leave town. As one of them puts it, in the future no matter how badly they are treated by girlfriends, their wives or even their bosses, they will look back and know that nobody treated them as badly as they were going to treat this women. Nice guys? Now what does this movie show us? What insight into the human mind or into the mind of some subtype of men can we glean? Well, they carry out the plan albeit with some complications. When she realizes what was done to her, the young woman says to one of the men, "Why did you do this?" He answers, "Because I could?" Does that line sound familiar? Although the line became famous a few years after this movie was made Bill Clinton is the person who immortalized those words in response to a question from Dan Rather in a 60 Minute TV interview as to why he had his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton replied, "I think I did something for the worst possible reason-just because I could. I think that's the most, just about the most morally indefensible reason that anybody could have for doing anything. When you do something just because you couldÂ… I've thought about it a lot. And there are lots of more sophisticated explanations, more complicated psychological explanations. But none of them are an excuse." Those psychological reasons may vary from person to person and there were two male characters in the movie and of course Clinton is a character himself. In some there is a core of self-centeredness or narcissism, some of which may make you a good leader or a boss but too much of it will be a disaster. Then in some individuals there is a great insecurity, which can include jealousy and aggression. We saw a mixture of these in our characters in the movie. Director Neil LaBute made the six week time span move quickly and actors Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy were excellent. Although the performance of Stacy Edwards was also top notch, there was controversy in some circles who thought that a real deaf actress should have played the part. We should have mentioned that the susceptible attractive young women who was to be dumped had lost her hearing at age 8 and had a speech impairment. Some may find this movie very thought provoking. Hopefully it won't be too close to home.

    Here we have corporate culture at its worst in the 90s; two men, a decade out of college, going city to city and making their money by giving presentations and telling others what to do. It's a high-pressure job with what appears to be small reward. Both Chad and Howard are slowly becoming fed up as they see younger men rise quicker and with less work ethic; they see their wives and girlfriends leave them without warning, breaking their hearts as their souls are destroyed in the workplace. It has become too much for Chad and he is looking for revenge. What better way to do so than at the demise of a girl, the fairer sex in which he says is composed of women "all the same, meat and gristle and hatred just simmering"? What if they could lead on some poor soul who has reached a point in her life where the prospect of a relationship or a future full of love is unattainable and than destroy her for sport to watch the reaction? Hell, they'll always be able to tell each other afterwards, "They never got me the way we got her". The writing is cynical and witty; this is one of the blackest comedies you will ever view. I literally felt bad laughing at times, but it is constructed so smartly, you just can't help yourself. Howard is a wormy romantic who knows Chad, the epitome of alpha male, from college and has stayed close through the years. He would never partake in a game such as this if not for the tale of his stronger buddy being cleaned out by his girl, even having the frame around his American Gigolo poster taken from him. If the sort of heartbreak Howard feels can happen to his friend too, well than maybe the female race deserves to be taught a lesson; unfortunately for temp Christine, that exercise will be brought upon her in full. She is the perfect fodder for their six week revenge plan, not only is she attractive, but she is deaf. Handicapped to the point where she wears headphones to appear distracted when unable to hear someone walk by, she is so far removed from the dating scene that the advances of two successful men in the office may just be too strong for her to pass up. Both men work together to show her so much affection that she will have to fall for at least one. Love, however, wasn't anticipated to play a role in the proceedings. As the weeks advance, the dates become more intimate, the bonds stronger. Sitting and watching the advancement starts to make it tough to discern true motivations. Are Chad and Howard really falling for her or are they that good at pretending in order to make the breakup as devastating as possible? Howard may not be getting as close physically to the girl, but his actions express a longing and need to be with her. Chad, on the other hand, working his magic and getting her in bed, has acquired the phrase he's been working towards, having her tell him she loves him. He responds in kind, but is it real? We will have to wait and see in week six whether the game has gone too far or whether it has gone just as planned. That statement may seem cruel, because the fact the ruse began at all means it went too farÂ—they are playing with an innocent's emotions and heart for sportÂ—but in the context of the film, you do start to buy into it and want to see what kind of fallout will result. LaBute does come from the stage and it shows here in his first film as most scenes are constructed from long takes and static setups. One moment on the rooftop has Chad almost flub a line, but they keep going, either to keep a sense of realism or save money on reshooting the exchange. Definitely shot on the cheap, it becomes the job of the actors to perform at the highest level, and they do not disappoint. Stacy Edwards is amazing as Christine, both in her portrayal of a deaf woman and in the emotional turmoil she must go through from start to finish. Also remember too, see is deceiving them by going out with both at the same time, selfishly keeping her own happiness above them knowing the truth. But it is Matt Malloy and Aaron Eckhart, as Howard and Chad respectively, that really carry the film. Malloy is a ball of nerves and insecurities, yet when he needs to be, either lying to the girl or venting to his friend, can compose himself to a man of power and force. Needing incentive to be confident, it is in him, but the moments where his insecurities rear their head shine above all else; never able to control the situation, he slowly devolves into a version of Chad. Chad, conversely, doesn't have a weak bone to his name. He says at the end that he can sell anyone, and it is true. The lines he utters are pure gold and I can see why it was hard for him to get work early in his career. Eckhart played a prick so well, no one wanted the controversy surrounding this role to take anything away from the new work. He is so conniving, so manipulative, yet with a smile that can charm us all. This film exists due to his performance and the revelations at the conclusion only cement him as one of the best screen villains ever. I'd love to see this story on stage, because The Shape of Things blew away its brilliant screen counterpart when I saw a college production, and I can only imagine watching this acted out in front of me would do the same if not more.

    After watching "In The Company of Men" it left me with an awful taste in my mouth. But at the same time it was a great movie watching experience as we examine the more lower depths of how inhumane we can really be as a society and yet still somehow manage to get with doing our actions. The strange irony is that this film runs at very unreasonable levels. The two leading male characters are couple of hateful humans that it in-spite of their wicked demeanour, I still seemed quite intrigued as what will transpire between these characters. Neil LaBute who wrote and directed this film gave freedom to the movie to just let things flow and avoids it from being preachy or overly moralizing. To me it makes this comedy all the more darker and at the same time more effective too. This tale focuses on a businessman named Chard (Aaron Eckhart), who without hesitation brutally confesses to his friend Howard (Matt Malloy) how much he despises all that is female. So then Chard persuades Howard into a scheming plot in which they're lead on a vulnerable woman and eventually when all is said and done, he will dump her. Chad's reason is a vicious plot at revenge due to the ways women have treated men. Chad assumes that their six-week hiatus to a satellite office is the perfect facility to carry this cruel scheme and while at that take the time to make a mockery on this poor victim at her expense. Howard himself goes along with the scheme feeling that this master-plan will backfire and through self-obligation, sides with Chad to see what will transpire. The plan starts to materialize as the lab rat for this scheme is a naive, shy secretary named Christine (Stacy Edwards) who works at the satellite office who is also deaf. The whole film, Chad and Howard take turns charming Christine, while that's progressing, their scheme starts to get out of control and takes its turns in expected turn of events. The manipulative schemes the men have on poor Christine are very deceitful that it's hard to watch at times. In the case of Chad, the plot is an attempt to emerge victorious as a ploy to further express his disdain to the female gender. Howard feels this scheme is unlawful, it more like to be aware of what's inside looking out instead of vice-versa. The audience and even Hoawrd himself know this plot will not work out. In most movies and T.V. shows they never do. But it's still intriguing in how this plan will come crashing down on them. And we hope that there might be a small fragment of humanity between Chad and Howard. Sure the outcome is predictable, but it's still fun to watch how it will backfire. The reason for dark comedy isn't the jokes or the action by the leading stars, but the laughter rests in the vicinity of what lengths people will go to to express how hateful we as human race truly are. The character-driven film scores high points in terms of depth. In addition to that it makes us reconsider our actions by what we say and do I'm glad that Mr. LaBute ended the film with a moral lesson or a perfectly wrapped happy ending. In the end in this case, the antagonist comes out the winner. And in the real world, bad people usually end up victorious in many situations. Granted Chad is a handsome individual and can wow the ladies with his charm quite easily. But at the same time time he's hypocritical, obnoxious and quite the condescending person who looks a nice person you want to punch in the mouth with. But he is still easy to identify with. There are a lot of Chad's out there And yet you feel sick to your stomach because you understand the psyche of this character so in the end I'm the jerk that has the egg on his face. The whole Chad, Howard and Christine love factor has some noteworthy things of interest here. You have two to put it loosely gentlemen of contrasting backgrounds. You have Chad, the handsome, suave ladies man, and then you have Howard who comes across as socially awkward who like most people of his kind in society are the one's who never come out on top (me included). And it's obvious Christine chooses the suave one over the awkward one. Matt Malloy was excellent portraying Howard. At fist he come across as an introverted individual. However, in the pivotal scenes in the end, it's a breath of fresh air when he lashes out when his buttons are pushed. Once the dust settles, we find these two jerks madly in love with Christine being the unlucky victim due to her being deaf. Both fall victim to the metaphoric love potion. Chad is at a loss of words to admit he loves her while Howard feels short that lost in a situation where he should have won. But in spite of the shortcomings within the characters, it is a wonderful character-driven story that might be hard to swallow in some situations.

    Neil Labute's "In The Company of Men" stars Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy as Chad and Howard, a pair of mid-level corporate executives sent to a boring regional branch for six weeks on a short term project. Frustrated, recently burnt by women, stuck in a career rut and high on corporate testosterone, the duo hatch a plan. "Let's hurt somebody," alpha-male Chad says. Pretty soon they're cooking up a Machiavellian scheme to locate an insecure woman, date her simultaneously, and dump her in the most vicious way possible. The woman they set their sights on is handicapped co-worker Christine. Christine has a speech impediment, but what she says doesn't matter to Chad anyway. Denied a voice, Chad handles her like an object to be acquired, traded, owned and discarded. Labute is heavily influenced by David Mamet. Most of the film finds Chad spewing corporate maxims, strutting about like a Master of the Universe and forcing co-workers to grovel at his feet. Eventually its revealed that Chad's scheming extends even to his "friend" Howard. He's your classic Extreme Sociopath, charming but endlessly manipulative. Everyone's his puppet. And as with Mamet's "workplace flicks", Chad's less a character than an extreme manifestation of a corporate logic whose drive for profit, ownership and expansion slowly infects how everyone around him thinks, acts and feels. Eventually Chad becomes both a norm and standard to aspire to. He's the new hypermasculinist ideal, for whom humiliation, domination, degradation, exploitation and suffering conflate with success. It's not only that aggressive competition in business affects masculinity, romance and sexual behaviour, but that corporate logic magnifies power, the ego and sanctions what is essentially various forms of rape. This stance is the opposite of how contemporary ideology is (mis)perceived, in which "business" is seen to be "neutral" and "mutually beneficial". Chad's a character who's popped up in many films and stories. More interesting is Howard, a fairly meek guy who is corrupted and made to do things even more horrible than Chad. The real world is made up of Howards. Chad's the anomaly, existing always more as spirit or underlying drive. La Bute penned "The Shape of Things" as an attempt to reverse the gender roles of "Company". Arguably his best film, it's also part of a tight trilogy by Labute about people's perceptions of physicality ("Fat Pig", "Reasons to be Pretty", "Shape of Things"). Massive spoilers ahead. "The Shape of Things" initially unfolds like a conventional romantic comedy. We're introduced to a dishevelled English Literature student called Adam, played by the always likable Paul Rudd, and an attractive art student called Evelyn (Rachel Weisz). The film then becomes a modern version of Adam's seduction by Eve. Eve ensnares Adam, manipulates him into becoming "fit", "attractive" and "healthy", and then reveals that she has never had romantic feelings toward him; she was merely using Adam as a sort of living art installation, a clay puppet, deceptively sculpting and moulding his mind and body. When Eve reveals her scheme to Adam Â– she invites him to an art installation in which he is quite literally presented as an exhibited object, her gaze now likened to the masculinist gaze of "In The Company of Men" - he's dumbfounded. Eve's tricked him into getting cosmetic surgery and altering his personality and physique. She's reconstructed him. Treated him as a chunk of malleable flesh. Unlike "Company", we're then invited to work our way through the messy ethical minefield of the victimiser's actions. For while Chad deservedly gets no sympathy in "Company", the relationship in "Things" is much harder to work out. Is Adam now a better person? Was Eve's love, no matter how virtual, beneficial to Adam? Was it ever real? How much authority should be given, or do we give, to artists? How much ethical responsibility do they hold or exercise? How do power relationships within romantic couples overlap with the power we grant artists? Don't Eve's actions echo the sexism of "Compny"? What is acceptable artistic material? Do the means, in art, justify the ends? At what point does creation become manipulation, is manipulation ever justified and at what point does creation destroy (see "Vertigo")? Is Adam now a beautiful work of "art" despite Eve's actions? How do Eve's actions differ from other vampiric artists, who take from and/or abuse outside sources? What does the film say about romance and the lover's desire to alter their partner? Art may be made by monsters, but what about the audience who enjoys? And on and on it goes. The film features a shot of the sentence "There is no morality in art". The quote's by Chinese novelist Han Suiyin, and is stencilled over Eve's art gallery. Throughout the film Eve articulates a similarly postmodern stance: "it's all subjective", she says, "moralists have no place in an art gallery". The firm itself is structured, we think, as an artist's apologia. Its first scene portrays Eve as an iconoclast who thrice breaks the rules, stepping over a rope at a museum, taking an illegal photograph of a sculpture and painting a penis onto a statue which has been censored by uptight museum curators. "You stepped over the line, Miss," curator Adam prophetically says when he firsts meets her. But as Eve makes clear, there should be no lines. We agree with her for much of the film. Afterall, hasn't she liberated Adam? By the film's end, however, we're asked to reconsider Eve's stance. Labute himself reconfigures Han Suiyin's quote. It's not that "there is no morality in art", in the sense that morality should not apply to art, but more literally, that "there is now, no longer, morality in art". Artists have no ethical compass, social feeling or attachment toward world, community or fellowman. Such art doesn't only exist in a vacuum, but is inherently selfish and nihilistic. You know, like Chad. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Almost every line and every scene in this tight, aggressive film is purposeful. Aaron Eckhart's performance as Chad is relaxed, controlled, and indifferently sadistic without being brutal. Matt Malloy's performance as Howard is absolutely necessary to the success of the film. The audience is never supposed to respect Howard, and Malloy commits unflinchingly to the role. Howard, in the end, discovers that he has been purposelessly led by his own weakness to want vindication for his ego--instead, he becomes a pathetic imitation of a romantic hero for a moral purpose he pretended to ignore. Some of the script suffers from believability. The beginning of the film, when Howard is slapped for asking a woman the time, is pretty unreasonable. If the film is (even an implicit) argument that women provoke men to be cruel, it proceeds from a false premise. The story boils down to the simple logic that Chad can manipulate and destroy Howard because Howard believes he's able to manipulate and destroy someone else. I envision Chad as a kind of false Satan--a man who pretends to be against God and morality solely for the purpose of seducing and destroying the lives of characters who believe in him. "How does it feel to really hurt someone?"

    In the Company of Men is a movie that makes one consider his or her actions after watching. The film puts the human conscience to the test by illustrating an exaggerated example of how heartless people can be at times. The film centered around three main characters. Aaron Eckhart played Chad, the arrogant, back-stabbing and ruthless bad guy. Christine, played by Stacy Edwards, was the first of Chad's "victims" of cruelty. Matt Malloy played Howard, a man who thought Chad was his friend. In early portions of the film, the theme appears to be revenge upon women by scorned men. However, as the plot thickens, the true theme of the film reveals itself. It turns out that Chad is planning to hurt anyone he can. The real theme of the film is that some people care about only themselves. Chad is a classic case of one of those people. Throughout the film, he carefully executes a plan to hurt Christine, a deaf woman who has not dated in a long time, due to her handicap. He uses Howard to help in the act of hurting Christine. Chad eventually accomplishes his main goal. However, Howard develops feelings for Christine and tells her that he and Chad had set out to hurt her from the beginning. He also tells her that he has fallen in love with her, although she never gives him a chance to prove that. As a result, Howard ends up being hurt as well. As the plan to hurt Christine comes to fruition, other subplots become evident. Smaller examples of the theme come to light. Chad organizes a series of events that lead to Howard being demoted from his position in the company he and Chad work for. It was no coincidence that Chad eventually was promoted to Howard's position. As the viewer watches Chad's plans unfold, certain elements of film production can be detected as enhancers of the theme. For example, the music between scenes is bold and loud. It gives one the impression that something ominous is going to happen. The music seems to create an element of building tension. One anticipates a huge event of a bad nature. The camera angles chosen for many of the scenes make Chad seem very powerful and evil. The scenes that use upward views of Chad and Howard together are particularly persuasive toward creating this impression. The various angles used in the date scenes between Chad and Christine further emphasize Chad's lack of conscience. The theme of this film, and the execution of the theme, is very similar to that found in The Usual Suspects. Both films focus on a character that is deceiving people purposely. They are also similar, in that the "villain" is not found out by the other characters until the end of the movie. The only difference is that Chad is not so eager to get away clean with his acts. He seems to be proud of his actions, and willingly tells Howard what he has done. This film's theme is one that makes some consider their actions, while it makes others strive to achieve such power. The effect it has on you should say something about the kind of person you are. It made me consider how awful it feels to be hurt. Those involved in making this film have put together a powerful piece that, while lacking in action, forces people to examine themselves and others.

    Misogynist Film of the Moment: In the Company of Men 3 11 2009 I just watched one of the worst movies ever. I share my opinion only because I want you to watch it as well and see if you relate or if you are repulsed. Some of you might've seen it before. The title sounded familiar and its for that reason that I let the movie take my evening away from me. There was an award given to the filmmaker. It was released in 1997. I usually don't blast movies because they are supposed to leave you in a mood. The director and writer don't do a good job of portraying the comedy to this dark comedy though, and as a result it comes off as a serious film, and leaves a bad taste in the viewers mouth. Do not let your girlfriends watch this movie. It will only add to the man hate already happening. This is fuel to the fire. That said, if you do watch it, try to figure out which of the two guys you are more like, Chad or Howard, and get back at me. I might have to start a new column where I share these discoveries with you. This is an insult to misogynists everywhere. Not approved. In The Company Of Men ----Ryan Mega sexdrugsmoney.com

    Chad is a perfect example of a sociopath/psychopath, someone who is amoral, takes risks in his personal and work life, is utterly charming when he is working on someone, but cold and and cruel when he no longer needs them. I thought this film was a brilliant portrayal of the psychopath and how he draws in his victims. Lying is second nature to him, he takes everything in his stride because he has no emotional response to anything that transpires. Chad is in control and it is almost hypnotic to see him manipulate those around him. There was another thread running through the story, the office politics, and Howard appeared to have missed what was really happening - just like a real life victim, he would not have realised just how evil Chad is. Definitely one for my collection of films about psychos.

    I remember seeing In the Company of Men a very long time agoÂ…not sure exactly when, but it was when I began noticing independent films verses big budgeted all-name films. And I loved it. It was a refreshing change from explosions every few minutes. Unfortunately, times have changed. Yeah, I still like the film Â– I am a sucker for "super-human" characters, and Chad (Eckhart) certainly is. But, now my eyes opened, recently, to pacing and movies that overstay their welcomes. Don't give up on this movie, however. It's a somewhat original idea with excellent acting from Eckhart as an, excuse my English, asshole whose main purpose is to see people suffer for mere amusement. Here we have two "gentlemen," Howard (Malloy) and Chad who work together Â– one being the boss, though they graduated close to each other, and are sent for six weeks to an undisclosed city to set up their sales business. In a little down time Â– as few and far between it is, Howard admits to his buddy that he's been recently dumped by his girlfriend. Chad retorts with his story of love-lost with his girlfriend and then proposes the idea of the movie: revenge against women. Chad wants to find that special nobody, and have both him and Howard date her, romance her, make her feel like she's on top of the world and then simply pull the rug out and laugh as she falls. Sounds cruel? Well, yeahÂ…there's no other way to describe it. However, it gets worse; the one they pick, Christine (Edwards) is deaf. They do what they set out to. But, unfortunately for the movie's sake: they make it painfully obvious that one will fall (for her,) one will rise and the end result is what you expect. What holds the movie together and makes it worth a viewing is Eckhart as Chad. He's evil. He's borderline Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct) but he's somewhat more despicable than Stone, because he makes this all the more real. Also, they both smoke like a chimneyÂ…not that it's relevant Â– it's just probably thrown in as "you simply can't trust a smoker" I'm assuming. In addition, the end revolutions, when both Chad Â– who explains his motivations, and Howard who, well, shouts his, also make it worthy of a complete viewing. And finally: Edwards who plays Christine, is really NOT deaf in real life, so her acting and "speech" is truly impressive. Listen to the audio commentary. This is real acting. It's not fast paced and it's based on the stereotypical movie "lie" approach that always leads to the clich&eacute; revolutionary scene, but it's interesting as a "yeah, this could really happen" story and the actual climax is quite fulfilling. Eckhart is so good in this role; you almost root for him, despite his evil intentions. The writing is good enough to see he did place his pieces (people) in the exact locations he wanted them and that's not pulled off by most actors. I do love super-human characters that use people as pawns. Stone did it brilliantly in Basic Instinct and Eckhart proved he could almost (give it about 80%) match her. Only, some of his scenes Â– such as, show me your balls Â– were a little off-kilter. As was his character.

    Engrossing and fascinating, if uncompromisingly nasty, film from provocateur Neil LaBute. Two businessmen, one alpha male, the other paunchy wimp, play with the emotions of a deaf coworker as a way to vent their own frustrations about work, sex -- and just about everything else about being human. The resulting film is angry and predictably uncomfortable to watch, but the compelling writing and performances are enough to keep you engaged. This was the first film to introduce me to the considerable talents of Aaron Eckhart, a chronically underrated actor. Grade: A-

    Early in the movie the premise of the story line is made clear. Two Yuppie businessmen away on a project in a branch office are discussing their relationships with women. They tell each other how badly they have treated them and how downtrodden they feel. This leads one of them to come up with a plan, which he convinces the other fellow to join in with him. They will find unsuspecting, susceptible young woman during the six weeks that are away. They will each wine, dine and romance her simultaneously and then both will dump her and leave town. As one of them puts it, in the future no matter how badly they are treated by girlfriends, their wives or even their bosses, they will look back and know that nobody treated them as badly as they were going to treat this women. Nice guys? Now what does this movie show us? What insight into the human mind or into the mind of some subtype of men can we glean? Well, they carry out the plan albeit with some complications. When she realizes what was done to her, the young woman says to one of the men, "Why did you do this?" He answers, "Because I could?" Does that line sound familiar? Although the line became famous a few years after this movie was made Bill Clinton is the person who immortalized those words in response to a question from Dan Rather in a 60 Minute TV interview as to why he had his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton replied, "I think I did something for the worst possible reason-just because I could. I think that's the most, just about the most morally indefensible reason that anybody could have for doing anything. When you do something just because you couldÂ… I've thought about it a lot. And there are lots of more sophisticated explanations, more complicated psychological explanations. But none of them are an excuse." Those psychological reasons may vary from person to person and there were two male characters in the movie and of course Clinton is a character himself. In some there is a core of self-centeredness or narcissism, some of which may make you a good leader or a boss but too much of it will be a disaster. Then in some individuals there is a great insecurity, which can include jealousy and aggression. We saw a mixture of these in our characters in the movie. Director Neil LaBute made the six week time span move quickly and actors Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy were excellent. Although the performance of Stacy Edwards was also top notch, there was controversy in some circles who thought that a real deaf actress should have played the part. We should have mentioned that the susceptible attractive young women who was to be dumped had lost her hearing at age 8 and had a speech impairment. Some may find this movie very thought provoking. Hopefully it won't be too close to home.

    Here we have corporate culture at its worst in the 90s; two men, a decade out of college, going city to city and making their money by giving presentations and telling others what to do. It's a high-pressure job with what appears to be small reward. Both Chad and Howard are slowly becoming fed up as they see younger men rise quicker and with less work ethic; they see their wives and girlfriends leave them without warning, breaking their hearts as their souls are destroyed in the workplace. It has become too much for Chad and he is looking for revenge. What better way to do so than at the demise of a girl, the fairer sex in which he says is composed of women "all the same, meat and gristle and hatred just simmering"? What if they could lead on some poor soul who has reached a point in her life where the prospect of a relationship or a future full of love is unattainable and than destroy her for sport to watch the reaction? Hell, they'll always be able to tell each other afterwards, "They never got me the way we got her". The writing is cynical and witty; this is one of the blackest comedies you will ever view. I literally felt bad laughing at times, but it is constructed so smartly, you just can't help yourself. Howard is a wormy romantic who knows Chad, the epitome of alpha male, from college and has stayed close through the years. He would never partake in a game such as this if not for the tale of his stronger buddy being cleaned out by his girl, even having the frame around his American Gigolo poster taken from him. If the sort of heartbreak Howard feels can happen to his friend too, well than maybe the female race deserves to be taught a lesson; unfortunately for temp Christine, that exercise will be brought upon her in full. She is the perfect fodder for their six week revenge plan, not only is she attractive, but she is deaf. Handicapped to the point where she wears headphones to appear distracted when unable to hear someone walk by, she is so far removed from the dating scene that the advances of two successful men in the office may just be too strong for her to pass up. Both men work together to show her so much affection that she will have to fall for at least one. Love, however, wasn't anticipated to play a role in the proceedings. As the weeks advance, the dates become more intimate, the bonds stronger. Sitting and watching the advancement starts to make it tough to discern true motivations. Are Chad and Howard really falling for her or are they that good at pretending in order to make the breakup as devastating as possible? Howard may not be getting as close physically to the girl, but his actions express a longing and need to be with her. Chad, on the other hand, working his magic and getting her in bed, has acquired the phrase he's been working towards, having her tell him she loves him. He responds in kind, but is it real? We will have to wait and see in week six whether the game has gone too far or whether it has gone just as planned. That statement may seem cruel, because the fact the ruse began at all means it went too farÂ—they are playing with an innocent's emotions and heart for sportÂ—but in the context of the film, you do start to buy into it and want to see what kind of fallout will result. LaBute does come from the stage and it shows here in his first film as most scenes are constructed from long takes and static setups. One moment on the rooftop has Chad almost flub a line, but they keep going, either to keep a sense of realism or save money on reshooting the exchange. Definitely shot on the cheap, it becomes the job of the actors to perform at the highest level, and they do not disappoint. Stacy Edwards is amazing as Christine, both in her portrayal of a deaf woman and in the emotional turmoil she must go through from start to finish. Also remember too, see is deceiving them by going out with both at the same time, selfishly keeping her own happiness above them knowing the truth. But it is Matt Malloy and Aaron Eckhart, as Howard and Chad respectively, that really carry the film. Malloy is a ball of nerves and insecurities, yet when he needs to be, either lying to the girl or venting to his friend, can compose himself to a man of power and force. Needing incentive to be confident, it is in him, but the moments where his insecurities rear their head shine above all else; never able to control the situation, he slowly devolves into a version of Chad. Chad, conversely, doesn't have a weak bone to his name. He says at the end that he can sell anyone, and it is true. The lines he utters are pure gold and I can see why it was hard for him to get work early in his career. Eckhart played a prick so well, no one wanted the controversy surrounding this role to take anything away from the new work. He is so conniving, so manipulative, yet with a smile that can charm us all. This film exists due to his performance and the revelations at the conclusion only cement him as one of the best screen villains ever. I'd love to see this story on stage, because The Shape of Things blew away its brilliant screen counterpart when I saw a college production, and I can only imagine watching this acted out in front of me would do the same if not more.

    After watching "In The Company of Men" it left me with an awful taste in my mouth. But at the same time it was a great movie watching experience as we examine the more lower depths of how inhumane we can really be as a society and yet still somehow manage to get with doing our actions. The strange irony is that this film runs at very unreasonable levels. The two leading male characters are couple of hateful humans that it in-spite of their wicked demeanour, I still seemed quite intrigued as what will transpire between these characters. Neil LaBute who wrote and directed this film gave freedom to the movie to just let things flow and avoids it from being preachy or overly moralizing. To me it makes this comedy all the more darker and at the same time more effective too. This tale focuses on a businessman named Chard (Aaron Eckhart), who without hesitation brutally confesses to his friend Howard (Matt Malloy) how much he despises all that is female. So then Chard persuades Howard into a scheming plot in which they're lead on a vulnerable woman and eventually when all is said and done, he will dump her. Chad's reason is a vicious plot at revenge due to the ways women have treated men. Chad assumes that their six-week hiatus to a satellite office is the perfect facility to carry this cruel scheme and while at that take the time to make a mockery on this poor victim at her expense. Howard himself goes along with the scheme feeling that this master-plan will backfire and through self-obligation, sides with Chad to see what will transpire. The plan starts to materialize as the lab rat for this scheme is a naive, shy secretary named Christine (Stacy Edwards) who works at the satellite office who is also deaf. The whole film, Chad and Howard take turns charming Christine, while that's progressing, their scheme starts to get out of control and takes its turns in expected turn of events. The manipulative schemes the men have on poor Christine are very deceitful that it's hard to watch at times. In the case of Chad, the plot is an attempt to emerge victorious as a ploy to further express his disdain to the female gender. Howard feels this scheme is unlawful, it more like to be aware of what's inside looking out instead of vice-versa. The audience and even Hoawrd himself know this plot will not work out. In most movies and T.V. shows they never do. But it's still intriguing in how this plan will come crashing down on them. And we hope that there might be a small fragment of humanity between Chad and Howard. Sure the outcome is predictable, but it's still fun to watch how it will backfire. The reason for dark comedy isn't the jokes or the action by the leading stars, but the laughter rests in the vicinity of what lengths people will go to to express how hateful we as human race truly are. The character-driven film scores high points in terms of depth. In addition to that it makes us reconsider our actions by what we say and do I'm glad that Mr. LaBute ended the film with a moral lesson or a perfectly wrapped happy ending. In the end in this case, the antagonist comes out the winner. And in the real world, bad people usually end up victorious in many situations. Granted Chad is a handsome individual and can wow the ladies with his charm quite easily. But at the same time time he's hypocritical, obnoxious and quite the condescending person who looks a nice person you want to punch in the mouth with. But he is still easy to identify with. There are a lot of Chad's out there And yet you feel sick to your stomach because you understand the psyche of this character so in the end I'm the jerk that has the egg on his face. The whole Chad, Howard and Christine love factor has some noteworthy things of interest here. You have two to put it loosely gentlemen of contrasting backgrounds. You have Chad, the handsome, suave ladies man, and then you have Howard who comes across as socially awkward who like most people of his kind in society are the one's who never come out on top (me included). And it's obvious Christine chooses the suave one over the awkward one. Matt Malloy was excellent portraying Howard. At fist he come across as an introverted individual. However, in the pivotal scenes in the end, it's a breath of fresh air when he lashes out when his buttons are pushed. Once the dust settles, we find these two jerks madly in love with Christine being the unlucky victim due to her being deaf. Both fall victim to the metaphoric love potion. Chad is at a loss of words to admit he loves her while Howard feels short that lost in a situation where he should have won. But in spite of the shortcomings within the characters, it is a wonderful character-driven story that might be hard to swallow in some situations.

    Neil Labute's "In The Company of Men" stars Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy as Chad and Howard, a pair of mid-level corporate executives sent to a boring regional branch for six weeks on a short term project. Frustrated, recently burnt by women, stuck in a career rut and high on corporate testosterone, the duo hatch a plan. "Let's hurt somebody," alpha-male Chad says. Pretty soon they're cooking up a Machiavellian scheme to locate an insecure woman, date her simultaneously, and dump her in the most vicious way possible. The woman they set their sights on is handicapped co-worker Christine. Christine has a speech impediment, but what she says doesn't matter to Chad anyway. Denied a voice, Chad handles her like an object to be acquired, traded, owned and discarded. Labute is heavily influenced by David Mamet. Most of the film finds Chad spewing corporate maxims, strutting about like a Master of the Universe and forcing co-workers to grovel at his feet. Eventually its revealed that Chad's scheming extends even to his "friend" Howard. He's your classic Extreme Sociopath, charming but endlessly manipulative. Everyone's his puppet. And as with Mamet's "workplace flicks", Chad's less a character than an extreme manifestation of a corporate logic whose drive for profit, ownership and expansion slowly infects how everyone around him thinks, acts and feels. Eventually Chad becomes both a norm and standard to aspire to. He's the new hypermasculinist ideal, for whom humiliation, domination, degradation, exploitation and suffering conflate with success. It's not only that aggressive competition in business affects masculinity, romance and sexual behaviour, but that corporate logic magnifies power, the ego and sanctions what is essentially various forms of rape. This stance is the opposite of how contemporary ideology is (mis)perceived, in which "business" is seen to be "neutral" and "mutually beneficial". Chad's a character who's popped up in many films and stories. More interesting is Howard, a fairly meek guy who is corrupted and made to do things even more horrible than Chad. The real world is made up of Howards. Chad's the anomaly, existing always more as spirit or underlying drive. La Bute penned "The Shape of Things" as an attempt to reverse the gender roles of "Company". Arguably his best film, it's also part of a tight trilogy by Labute about people's perceptions of physicality ("Fat Pig", "Reasons to be Pretty", "Shape of Things"). Massive spoilers ahead. "The Shape of Things" initially unfolds like a conventional romantic comedy. We're introduced to a dishevelled English Literature student called Adam, played by the always likable Paul Rudd, and an attractive art student called Evelyn (Rachel Weisz). The film then becomes a modern version of Adam's seduction by Eve. Eve ensnares Adam, manipulates him into becoming "fit", "attractive" and "healthy", and then reveals that she has never had romantic feelings toward him; she was merely using Adam as a sort of living art installation, a clay puppet, deceptively sculpting and moulding his mind and body. When Eve reveals her scheme to Adam Â– she invites him to an art installation in which he is quite literally presented as an exhibited object, her gaze now likened to the masculinist gaze of "In The Company of Men" - he's dumbfounded. Eve's tricked him into getting cosmetic surgery and altering his personality and physique. She's reconstructed him. Treated him as a chunk of malleable flesh. Unlike "Company", we're then invited to work our way through the messy ethical minefield of the victimiser's actions. For while Chad deservedly gets no sympathy in "Company", the relationship in "Things" is much harder to work out. Is Adam now a better person? Was Eve's love, no matter how virtual, beneficial to Adam? Was it ever real? How much authority should be given, or do we give, to artists? How much ethical responsibility do they hold or exercise? How do power relationships within romantic couples overlap with the power we grant artists? Don't Eve's actions echo the sexism of "Compny"? What is acceptable artistic material? Do the means, in art, justify the ends? At what point does creation become manipulation, is manipulation ever justified and at what point does creation destroy (see "Vertigo")? Is Adam now a beautiful work of "art" despite Eve's actions? How do Eve's actions differ from other vampiric artists, who take from and/or abuse outside sources? What does the film say about romance and the lover's desire to alter their partner? Art may be made by monsters, but what about the audience who enjoys? And on and on it goes. The film features a shot of the sentence "There is no morality in art". The quote's by Chinese novelist Han Suiyin, and is stencilled over Eve's art gallery. Throughout the film Eve articulates a similarly postmodern stance: "it's all subjective", she says, "moralists have no place in an art gallery". The firm itself is structured, we think, as an artist's apologia. Its first scene portrays Eve as an iconoclast who thrice breaks the rules, stepping over a rope at a museum, taking an illegal photograph of a sculpture and painting a penis onto a statue which has been censored by uptight museum curators. "You stepped over the line, Miss," curator Adam prophetically says when he firsts meets her. But as Eve makes clear, there should be no lines. We agree with her for much of the film. Afterall, hasn't she liberated Adam? By the film's end, however, we're asked to reconsider Eve's stance. Labute himself reconfigures Han Suiyin's quote. It's not that "there is no morality in art", in the sense that morality should not apply to art, but more literally, that "there is now, no longer, morality in art". Artists have no ethical compass, social feeling or attachment toward world, community or fellowman. Such art doesn't only exist in a vacuum, but is inherently selfish and nihilistic. You know, like Chad. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Almost every line and every scene in this tight, aggressive film is purposeful. Aaron Eckhart's performance as Chad is relaxed, controlled, and indifferently sadistic without being brutal. Matt Malloy's performance as Howard is absolutely necessary to the success of the film. The audience is never supposed to respect Howard, and Malloy commits unflinchingly to the role. Howard, in the end, discovers that he has been purposelessly led by his own weakness to want vindication for his ego--instead, he becomes a pathetic imitation of a romantic hero for a moral purpose he pretended to ignore. Some of the script suffers from believability. The beginning of the film, when Howard is slapped for asking a woman the time, is pretty unreasonable. If the film is (even an implicit) argument that women provoke men to be cruel, it proceeds from a false premise. The story boils down to the simple logic that Chad can manipulate and destroy Howard because Howard believes he's able to manipulate and destroy someone else. I envision Chad as a kind of false Satan--a man who pretends to be against God and morality solely for the purpose of seducing and destroying the lives of characters who believe in him. "How does it feel to really hurt someone?"

    In the Company of Men is a movie that makes one consider his or her actions after watching. The film puts the human conscience to the test by illustrating an exaggerated example of how heartless people can be at times. The film centered around three main characters. Aaron Eckhart played Chad, the arrogant, back-stabbing and ruthless bad guy. Christine, played by Stacy Edwards, was the first of Chad's "victims" of cruelty. Matt Malloy played Howard, a man who thought Chad was his friend. In early portions of the film, the theme appears to be revenge upon women by scorned men. However, as the plot thickens, the true theme of the film reveals itself. It turns out that Chad is planning to hurt anyone he can. The real theme of the film is that some people care about only themselves. Chad is a classic case of one of those people. Throughout the film, he carefully executes a plan to hurt Christine, a deaf woman who has not dated in a long time, due to her handicap. He uses Howard to help in the act of hurting Christine. Chad eventually accomplishes his main goal. However, Howard develops feelings for Christine and tells her that he and Chad had set out to hurt her from the beginning. He also tells her that he has fallen in love with her, although she never gives him a chance to prove that. As a result, Howard ends up being hurt as well. As the plan to hurt Christine comes to fruition, other subplots become evident. Smaller examples of the theme come to light. Chad organizes a series of events that lead to Howard being demoted from his position in the company he and Chad work for. It was no coincidence that Chad eventually was promoted to Howard's position. As the viewer watches Chad's plans unfold, certain elements of film production can be detected as enhancers of the theme. For example, the music between scenes is bold and loud. It gives one the impression that something ominous is going to happen. The music seems to create an element of building tension. One anticipates a huge event of a bad nature. The camera angles chosen for many of the scenes make Chad seem very powerful and evil. The scenes that use upward views of Chad and Howard together are particularly persuasive toward creating this impression. The various angles used in the date scenes between Chad and Christine further emphasize Chad's lack of conscience. The theme of this film, and the execution of the theme, is very similar to that found in The Usual Suspects. Both films focus on a character that is deceiving people purposely. They are also similar, in that the "villain" is not found out by the other characters until the end of the movie. The only difference is that Chad is not so eager to get away clean with his acts. He seems to be proud of his actions, and willingly tells Howard what he has done. This film's theme is one that makes some consider their actions, while it makes others strive to achieve such power. The effect it has on you should say something about the kind of person you are. It made me consider how awful it feels to be hurt. Those involved in making this film have put together a powerful piece that, while lacking in action, forces people to examine themselves and others.

    Misogynist Film of the Moment: In the Company of Men 3 11 2009 I just watched one of the worst movies ever. I share my opinion only because I want you to watch it as well and see if you relate or if you are repulsed. Some of you might've seen it before. The title sounded familiar and its for that reason that I let the movie take my evening away from me. There was an award given to the filmmaker. It was released in 1997. I usually don't blast movies because they are supposed to leave you in a mood. The director and writer don't do a good job of portraying the comedy to this dark comedy though, and as a result it comes off as a serious film, and leaves a bad taste in the viewers mouth. Do not let your girlfriends watch this movie. It will only add to the man hate already happening. This is fuel to the fire. That said, if you do watch it, try to figure out which of the two guys you are more like, Chad or Howard, and get back at me. I might have to start a new column where I share these discoveries with you. This is an insult to misogynists everywhere. Not approved. In The Company Of Men ----Ryan Mega sexdrugsmoney.com

    Chad is a perfect example of a sociopath/psychopath, someone who is amoral, takes risks in his personal and work life, is utterly charming when he is working on someone, but cold and and cruel when he no longer needs them. I thought this film was a brilliant portrayal of the psychopath and how he draws in his victims. Lying is second nature to him, he takes everything in his stride because he has no emotional response to anything that transpires. Chad is in control and it is almost hypnotic to see him manipulate those around him. There was another thread running through the story, the office politics, and Howard appeared to have missed what was really happening - just like a real life victim, he would not have realised just how evil Chad is. Definitely one for my collection of films about psychos.

    I remember seeing In the Company of Men a very long time agoÂ…not sure exactly when, but it was when I began noticing independent films verses big budgeted all-name films. And I loved it. It was a refreshing change from explosions every few minutes. Unfortunately, times have changed. Yeah, I still like the film Â– I am a sucker for "super-human" characters, and Chad (Eckhart) certainly is. But, now my eyes opened, recently, to pacing and movies that overstay their welcomes. Don't give up on this movie, however. It's a somewhat original idea with excellent acting from Eckhart as an, excuse my English, asshole whose main purpose is to see people suffer for mere amusement. Here we have two "gentlemen," Howard (Malloy) and Chad who work together Â– one being the boss, though they graduated close to each other, and are sent for six weeks to an undisclosed city to set up their sales business. In a little down time Â– as few and far between it is, Howard admits to his buddy that he's been recently dumped by his girlfriend. Chad retorts with his story of love-lost with his girlfriend and then proposes the idea of the movie: revenge against women. Chad wants to find that special nobody, and have both him and Howard date her, romance her, make her feel like she's on top of the world and then simply pull the rug out and laugh as she falls. Sounds cruel? Well, yeahÂ…there's no other way to describe it. However, it gets worse; the one they pick, Christine (Edwards) is deaf. They do what they set out to. But, unfortunately for the movie's sake: they make it painfully obvious that one will fall (for her,) one will rise and the end result is what you expect. What holds the movie together and makes it worth a viewing is Eckhart as Chad. He's evil. He's borderline Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct) but he's somewhat more despicable than Stone, because he makes this all the more real. Also, they both smoke like a chimneyÂ…not that it's relevant Â– it's just probably thrown in as "you simply can't trust a smoker" I'm assuming. In addition, the end revolutions, when both Chad Â– who explains his motivations, and Howard who, well, shouts his, also make it worthy of a complete viewing. And finally: Edwards who plays Christine, is really NOT deaf in real life, so her acting and "speech" is truly impressive. Listen to the audio commentary. This is real acting. It's not fast paced and it's based on the stereotypical movie "lie" approach that always leads to the clich&eacute; revolutionary scene, but it's interesting as a "yeah, this could really happen" story and the actual climax is quite fulfilling. Eckhart is so good in this role; you almost root for him, despite his evil intentions. The writing is good enough to see he did place his pieces (people) in the exact locations he wanted them and that's not pulled off by most actors. I do love super-human characters that use people as pawns. Stone did it brilliantly in Basic Instinct and Eckhart proved he could almost (give it about 80%) match her. Only, some of his scenes Â– such as, show me your balls Â– were a little off-kilter. As was his character.

    Engrossing and fascinating, if uncompromisingly nasty, film from provocateur Neil LaBute. Two businessmen, one alpha male, the other paunchy wimp, play with the emotions of a deaf coworker as a way to vent their own frustrations about work, sex -- and just about everything else about being human. The resulting film is angry and predictably uncomfortable to watch, but the compelling writing and performances are enough to keep you engaged. This was the first film to introduce me to the considerable talents of Aaron Eckhart, a chronically underrated actor. Grade: A-

    Early in the movie the premise of the story line is made clear. Two Yuppie businessmen away on a project in a branch office are discussing their relationships with women. They tell each other how badly they have treated them and how downtrodden they feel. This leads one of them to come up with a plan, which he convinces the other fellow to join in with him. They will find unsuspecting, susceptible young woman during the six weeks that are away. They will each wine, dine and romance her simultaneously and then both will dump her and leave town. As one of them puts it, in the future no matter how badly they are treated by girlfriends, their wives or even their bosses, they will look back and know that nobody treated them as badly as they were going to treat this women. Nice guys? Now what does this movie show us? What insight into the human mind or into the mind of some subtype of men can we glean? Well, they carry out the plan albeit with some complications. When she realizes what was done to her, the young woman says to one of the men, "Why did you do this?" He answers, "Because I could?" Does that line sound familiar? Although the line became famous a few years after this movie was made Bill Clinton is the person who immortalized those words in response to a question from Dan Rather in a 60 Minute TV interview as to why he had his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton replied, "I think I did something for the worst possible reason-just because I could. I think that's the most, just about the most morally indefensible reason that anybody could have for doing anything. When you do something just because you couldÂ… I've thought about it a lot. And there are lots of more sophisticated explanations, more complicated psychological explanations. But none of them are an excuse." Those psychological reasons may vary from person to person and there were two male characters in the movie and of course Clinton is a character himself. In some there is a core of self-centeredness or narcissism, some of which may make you a good leader or a boss but too much of it will be a disaster. Then in some individuals there is a great insecurity, which can include jealousy and aggression. We saw a mixture of these in our characters in the movie. Director Neil LaBute made the six week time span move quickly and actors Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy were excellent. Although the performance of Stacy Edwards was also top notch, there was controversy in some circles who thought that a real deaf actress should have played the part. We should have mentioned that the susceptible attractive young women who was to be dumped had lost her hearing at age 8 and had a speech impairment. Some may find this movie very thought provoking. Hopefully it won't be too close to home.

    Here we have corporate culture at its worst in the 90s; two men, a decade out of college, going city to city and making their money by giving presentations and telling others what to do. It's a high-pressure job with what appears to be small reward. Both Chad and Howard are slowly becoming fed up as they see younger men rise quicker and with less work ethic; they see their wives and girlfriends leave them without warning, breaking their hearts as their souls are destroyed in the workplace. It has become too much for Chad and he is looking for revenge. What better way to do so than at the demise of a girl, the fairer sex in which he says is composed of women "all the same, meat and gristle and hatred just simmering"? What if they could lead on some poor soul who has reached a point in her life where the prospect of a relationship or a future full of love is unattainable and than destroy her for sport to watch the reaction? Hell, they'll always be able to tell each other afterwards, "They never got me the way we got her". The writing is cynical and witty; this is one of the blackest comedies you will ever view. I literally felt bad laughing at times, but it is constructed so smartly, you just can't help yourself. Howard is a wormy romantic who knows Chad, the epitome of alpha male, from college and has stayed close through the years. He would never partake in a game such as this if not for the tale of his stronger buddy being cleaned out by his girl, even having the frame around his American Gigolo poster taken from him. If the sort of heartbreak Howard feels can happen to his friend too, well than maybe the female race deserves to be taught a lesson; unfortunately for temp Christine, that exercise will be brought upon her in full. She is the perfect fodder for their six week revenge plan, not only is she attractive, but she is deaf. Handicapped to the point where she wears headphones to appear distracted when unable to hear someone walk by, she is so far removed from the dating scene that the advances of two successful men in the office may just be too strong for her to pass up. Both men work together to show her so much affection that she will have to fall for at least one. Love, however, wasn't anticipated to play a role in the proceedings. As the weeks advance, the dates become more intimate, the bonds stronger. Sitting and watching the advancement starts to make it tough to discern true motivations. Are Chad and Howard really falling for her or are they that good at pretending in order to make the breakup as devastating as possible? Howard may not be getting as close physically to the girl, but his actions express a longing and need to be with her. Chad, on the other hand, working his magic and getting her in bed, has acquired the phrase he's been working towards, having her tell him she loves him. He responds in kind, but is it real? We will have to wait and see in week six whether the game has gone too far or whether it has gone just as planned. That statement may seem cruel, because the fact the ruse began at all means it went too farÂ—they are playing with an innocent's emotions and heart for sportÂ—but in the context of the film, you do start to buy into it and want to see what kind of fallout will result. LaBute does come from the stage and it shows here in his first film as most scenes are constructed from long takes and static setups. One moment on the rooftop has Chad almost flub a line, but they keep going, either to keep a sense of realism or save money on reshooting the exchange. Definitely shot on the cheap, it becomes the job of the actors to perform at the highest level, and they do not disappoint. Stacy Edwards is amazing as Christine, both in her portrayal of a deaf woman and in the emotional turmoil she must go through from start to finish. Also remember too, see is deceiving them by going out with both at the same time, selfishly keeping her own happiness above them knowing the truth. But it is Matt Malloy and Aaron Eckhart, as Howard and Chad respectively, that really carry the film. Malloy is a ball of nerves and insecurities, yet when he needs to be, either lying to the girl or venting to his friend, can compose himself to a man of power and force. Needing incentive to be confident, it is in him, but the moments where his insecurities rear their head shine above all else; never able to control the situation, he slowly devolves into a version of Chad. Chad, conversely, doesn't have a weak bone to his name. He says at the end that he can sell anyone, and it is true. The lines he utters are pure gold and I can see why it was hard for him to get work early in his career. Eckhart played a prick so well, no one wanted the controversy surrounding this role to take anything away from the new work. He is so conniving, so manipulative, yet with a smile that can charm us all. This film exists due to his performance and the revelations at the conclusion only cement him as one of the best screen villains ever. I'd love to see this story on stage, because The Shape of Things blew away its brilliant screen counterpart when I saw a college production, and I can only imagine watching this acted out in front of me would do the same if not more.

    After watching "In The Company of Men" it left me with an awful taste in my mouth. But at the same time it was a great movie watching experience as we examine the more lower depths of how inhumane we can really be as a society and yet still somehow manage to get with doing our actions. The strange irony is that this film runs at very unreasonable levels. The two leading male characters are couple of hateful humans that it in-spite of their wicked demeanour, I still seemed quite intrigued as what will transpire between these characters. Neil LaBute who wrote and directed this film gave freedom to the movie to just let things flow and avoids it from being preachy or overly moralizing. To me it makes this comedy all the more darker and at the same time more effective too. This tale focuses on a businessman named Chard (Aaron Eckhart), who without hesitation brutally confesses to his friend Howard (Matt Malloy) how much he despises all that is female. So then Chard persuades Howard into a scheming plot in which they're lead on a vulnerable woman and eventually when all is said and done, he will dump her. Chad's reason is a vicious plot at revenge due to the ways women have treated men. Chad assumes that their six-week hiatus to a satellite office is the perfect facility to carry this cruel scheme and while at that take the time to make a mockery on this poor victim at her expense. Howard himself goes along with the scheme feeling that this master-plan will backfire and through self-obligation, sides with Chad to see what will transpire. The plan starts to materialize as the lab rat for this scheme is a naive, shy secretary named Christine (Stacy Edwards) who works at the satellite office who is also deaf. The whole film, Chad and Howard take turns charming Christine, while that's progressing, their scheme starts to get out of control and takes its turns in expected turn of events. The manipulative schemes the men have on poor Christine are very deceitful that it's hard to watch at times. In the case of Chad, the plot is an attempt to emerge victorious as a ploy to further express his disdain to the female gender. Howard feels this scheme is unlawful, it more like to be aware of what's inside looking out instead of vice-versa. The audience and even Hoawrd himself know this plot will not work out. In most movies and T.V. shows they never do. But it's still intriguing in how this plan will come crashing down on them. And we hope that there might be a small fragment of humanity between Chad and Howard. Sure the outcome is predictable, but it's still fun to watch how it will backfire. The reason for dark comedy isn't the jokes or the action by the leading stars, but the laughter rests in the vicinity of what lengths people will go to to express how hateful we as human race truly are. The character-driven film scores high points in terms of depth. In addition to that it makes us reconsider our actions by what we say and do I'm glad that Mr. LaBute ended the film with a moral lesson or a perfectly wrapped happy ending. In the end in this case, the antagonist comes out the winner. And in the real world, bad people usually end up victorious in many situations. Granted Chad is a handsome individual and can wow the ladies with his charm quite easily. But at the same time time he's hypocritical, obnoxious and quite the condescending person who looks a nice person you want to punch in the mouth with. But he is still easy to identify with. There are a lot of Chad's out there And yet you feel sick to your stomach because you understand the psyche of this character so in the end I'm the jerk that has the egg on his face. The whole Chad, Howard and Christine love factor has some noteworthy things of interest here. You have two to put it loosely gentlemen of contrasting backgrounds. You have Chad, the handsome, suave ladies man, and then you have Howard who comes across as socially awkward who like most people of his kind in society are the one's who never come out on top (me included). And it's obvious Christine chooses the suave one over the awkward one. Matt Malloy was excellent portraying Howard. At fist he come across as an introverted individual. However, in the pivotal scenes in the end, it's a breath of fresh air when he lashes out when his buttons are pushed. Once the dust settles, we find these two jerks madly in love with Christine being the unlucky victim due to her being deaf. Both fall victim to the metaphoric love potion. Chad is at a loss of words to admit he loves her while Howard feels short that lost in a situation where he should have won. But in spite of the shortcomings within the characters, it is a wonderful character-driven story that might be hard to swallow in some situations.

    Neil Labute's "In The Company of Men" stars Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy as Chad and Howard, a pair of mid-level corporate executives sent to a boring regional branch for six weeks on a short term project. Frustrated, recently burnt by women, stuck in a career rut and high on corporate testosterone, the duo hatch a plan. "Let's hurt somebody," alpha-male Chad says. Pretty soon they're cooking up a Machiavellian scheme to locate an insecure woman, date her simultaneously, and dump her in the most vicious way possible. The woman they set their sights on is handicapped co-worker Christine. Christine has a speech impediment, but what she says doesn't matter to Chad anyway. Denied a voice, Chad handles her like an object to be acquired, traded, owned and discarded. Labute is heavily influenced by David Mamet. Most of the film finds Chad spewing corporate maxims, strutting about like a Master of the Universe and forcing co-workers to grovel at his feet. Eventually its revealed that Chad's scheming extends even to his "friend" Howard. He's your classic Extreme Sociopath, charming but endlessly manipulative. Everyone's his puppet. And as with Mamet's "workplace flicks", Chad's less a character than an extreme manifestation of a corporate logic whose drive for profit, ownership and expansion slowly infects how everyone around him thinks, acts and feels. Eventually Chad becomes both a norm and standard to aspire to. He's the new hypermasculinist ideal, for whom humiliation, domination, degradation, exploitation and suffering conflate with success. It's not only that aggressive competition in business affects masculinity, romance and sexual behaviour, but that corporate logic magnifies power, the ego and sanctions what is essentially various forms of rape. This stance is the opposite of how contemporary ideology is (mis)perceived, in which "business" is seen to be "neutral" and "mutually beneficial". Chad's a character who's popped up in many films and stories. More interesting is Howard, a fairly meek guy who is corrupted and made to do things even more horrible than Chad. The real world is made up of Howards. Chad's the anomaly, existing always more as spirit or underlying drive. La Bute penned "The Shape of Things" as an attempt to reverse the gender roles of "Company". Arguably his best film, it's also part of a tight trilogy by Labute about people's perceptions of physicality ("Fat Pig", "Reasons to be Pretty", "Shape of Things"). Massive spoilers ahead. "The Shape of Things" initially unfolds like a conventional romantic comedy. We're introduced to a dishevelled English Literature student called Adam, played by the always likable Paul Rudd, and an attractive art student called Evelyn (Rachel Weisz). The film then becomes a modern version of Adam's seduction by Eve. Eve ensnares Adam, manipulates him into becoming "fit", "attractive" and "healthy", and then reveals that she has never had romantic feelings toward him; she was merely using Adam as a sort of living art installation, a clay puppet, deceptively sculpting and moulding his mind and body. When Eve reveals her scheme to Adam Â– she invites him to an art installation in which he is quite literally presented as an exhibited object, her gaze now likened to the masculinist gaze of "In The Company of Men" - he's dumbfounded. Eve's tricked him into getting cosmetic surgery and altering his personality and physique. She's reconstructed him. Treated him as a chunk of malleable flesh. Unlike "Company", we're then invited to work our way through the messy ethical minefield of the victimiser's actions. For while Chad deservedly gets no sympathy in "Company", the relationship in "Things" is much harder to work out. Is Adam now a better person? Was Eve's love, no matter how virtual, beneficial to Adam? Was it ever real? How much authority should be given, or do we give, to artists? How much ethical responsibility do they hold or exercise? How do power relationships within romantic couples overlap with the power we grant artists? Don't Eve's actions echo the sexism of "Compny"? What is acceptable artistic material? Do the means, in art, justify the ends? At what point does creation become manipulation, is manipulation ever justified and at what point does creation destroy (see "Vertigo")? Is Adam now a beautiful work of "art" despite Eve's actions? How do Eve's actions differ from other vampiric artists, who take from and/or abuse outside sources? What does the film say about romance and the lover's desire to alter their partner? Art may be made by monsters, but what about the audience who enjoys? And on and on it goes. The film features a shot of the sentence "There is no morality in art". The quote's by Chinese novelist Han Suiyin, and is stencilled over Eve's art gallery. Throughout the film Eve articulates a similarly postmodern stance: "it's all subjective", she says, "moralists have no place in an art gallery". The firm itself is structured, we think, as an artist's apologia. Its first scene portrays Eve as an iconoclast who thrice breaks the rules, stepping over a rope at a museum, taking an illegal photograph of a sculpture and painting a penis onto a statue which has been censored by uptight museum curators. "You stepped over the line, Miss," curator Adam prophetically says when he firsts meets her. But as Eve makes clear, there should be no lines. We agree with her for much of the film. Afterall, hasn't she liberated Adam? By the film's end, however, we're asked to reconsider Eve's stance. Labute himself reconfigures Han Suiyin's quote. It's not that "there is no morality in art", in the sense that morality should not apply to art, but more literally, that "there is now, no longer, morality in art". Artists have no ethical compass, social feeling or attachment toward world, community or fellowman. Such art doesn't only exist in a vacuum, but is inherently selfish and nihilistic. You know, like Chad. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Almost every line and every scene in this tight, aggressive film is purposeful. Aaron Eckhart's performance as Chad is relaxed, controlled, and indifferently sadistic without being brutal. Matt Malloy's performance as Howard is absolutely necessary to the success of the film. The audience is never supposed to respect Howard, and Malloy commits unflinchingly to the role. Howard, in the end, discovers that he has been purposelessly led by his own weakness to want vindication for his ego--instead, he becomes a pathetic imitation of a romantic hero for a moral purpose he pretended to ignore. Some of the script suffers from believability. The beginning of the film, when Howard is slapped for asking a woman the time, is pretty unreasonable. If the film is (even an implicit) argument that women provoke men to be cruel, it proceeds from a false premise. The story boils down to the simple logic that Chad can manipulate and destroy Howard because Howard believes he's able to manipulate and destroy someone else. I envision Chad as a kind of false Satan--a man who pretends to be against God and morality solely for the purpose of seducing and destroying the lives of characters who believe in him. "How does it feel to really hurt someone?"

    In the Company of Men is a movie that makes one consider his or her actions after watching. The film puts the human conscience to the test by illustrating an exaggerated example of how heartless people can be at times. The film centered around three main characters. Aaron Eckhart played Chad, the arrogant, back-stabbing and ruthless bad guy. Christine, played by Stacy Edwards, was the first of Chad's "victims" of cruelty. Matt Malloy played Howard, a man who thought Chad was his friend. In early portions of the film, the theme appears to be revenge upon women by scorned men. However, as the plot thickens, the true theme of the film reveals itself. It turns out that Chad is planning to hurt anyone he can. The real theme of the film is that some people care about only themselves. Chad is a classic case of one of those people. Throughout the film, he carefully executes a plan to hurt Christine, a deaf woman who has not dated in a long time, due to her handicap. He uses Howard to help in the act of hurting Christine. Chad eventually accomplishes his main goal. However, Howard develops feelings for Christine and tells her that he and Chad had set out to hurt her from the beginning. He also tells her that he has fallen in love with her, although she never gives him a chance to prove that. As a result, Howard ends up being hurt as well. As the plan to hurt Christine comes to fruition, other subplots become evident. Smaller examples of the theme come to light. Chad organizes a series of events that lead to Howard being demoted from his position in the company he and Chad work for. It was no coincidence that Chad eventually was promoted to Howard's position. As the viewer watches Chad's plans unfold, certain elements of film production can be detected as enhancers of the theme. For example, the music between scenes is bold and loud. It gives one the impression that something ominous is going to happen. The music seems to create an element of building tension. One anticipates a huge event of a bad nature. The camera angles chosen for many of the scenes make Chad seem very powerful and evil. The scenes that use upward views of Chad and Howard together are particularly persuasive toward creating this impression. The various angles used in the date scenes between Chad and Christine further emphasize Chad's lack of conscience. The theme of this film, and the execution of the theme, is very similar to that found in The Usual Suspects. Both films focus on a character that is deceiving people purposely. They are also similar, in that the "villain" is not found out by the other characters until the end of the movie. The only difference is that Chad is not so eager to get away clean with his acts. He seems to be proud of his actions, and willingly tells Howard what he has done. This film's theme is one that makes some consider their actions, while it makes others strive to achieve such power. The effect it has on you should say something about the kind of person you are. It made me consider how awful it feels to be hurt. Those involved in making this film have put together a powerful piece that, while lacking in action, forces people to examine themselves and others.

    Misogynist Film of the Moment: In the Company of Men 3 11 2009 I just watched one of the worst movies ever. I share my opinion only because I want you to watch it as well and see if you relate or if you are repulsed. Some of you might've seen it before. The title sounded familiar and its for that reason that I let the movie take my evening away from me. There was an award given to the filmmaker. It was released in 1997. I usually don't blast movies because they are supposed to leave you in a mood. The director and writer don't do a good job of portraying the comedy to this dark comedy though, and as a result it comes off as a serious film, and leaves a bad taste in the viewers mouth. Do not let your girlfriends watch this movie. It will only add to the man hate already happening. This is fuel to the fire. That said, if you do watch it, try to figure out which of the two guys you are more like, Chad or Howard, and get back at me. I might have to start a new column where I share these discoveries with you. This is an insult to misogynists everywhere. Not approved. In The Company Of Men ----Ryan Mega sexdrugsmoney.com

    Chad is a perfect example of a sociopath/psychopath, someone who is amoral, takes risks in his personal and work life, is utterly charming when he is working on someone, but cold and and cruel when he no longer needs them. I thought this film was a brilliant portrayal of the psychopath and how he draws in his victims. Lying is second nature to him, he takes everything in his stride because he has no emotional response to anything that transpires. Chad is in control and it is almost hypnotic to see him manipulate those around him. There was another thread running through the story, the office politics, and Howard appeared to have missed what was really happening - just like a real life victim, he would not have realised just how evil Chad is. Definitely one for my collection of films about psychos.

    I remember seeing In the Company of Men a very long time agoÂ…not sure exactly when, but it was when I began noticing independent films verses big budgeted all-name films. And I loved it. It was a refreshing change from explosions every few minutes. Unfortunately, times have changed. Yeah, I still like the film Â– I am a sucker for "super-human" characters, and Chad (Eckhart) certainly is. But, now my eyes opened, recently, to pacing and movies that overstay their welcomes. Don't give up on this movie, however. It's a somewhat original idea with excellent acting from Eckhart as an, excuse my English, asshole whose main purpose is to see people suffer for mere amusement. Here we have two "gentlemen," Howard (Malloy) and Chad who work together Â– one being the boss, though they graduated close to each other, and are sent for six weeks to an undisclosed city to set up their sales business. In a little down time Â– as few and far between it is, Howard admits to his buddy that he's been recently dumped by his girlfriend. Chad retorts with his story of love-lost with his girlfriend and then proposes the idea of the movie: revenge against women. Chad wants to find that special nobody, and have both him and Howard date her, romance her, make her feel like she's on top of the world and then simply pull the rug out and laugh as she falls. Sounds cruel? Well, yeahÂ…there's no other way to describe it. However, it gets worse; the one they pick, Christine (Edwards) is deaf. They do what they set out to. But, unfortunately for the movie's sake: they make it painfully obvious that one will fall (for her,) one will rise and the end result is what you expect. What holds the movie together and makes it worth a viewing is Eckhart as Chad. He's evil. He's borderline Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct) but he's somewhat more despicable than Stone, because he makes this all the more real. Also, they both smoke like a chimneyÂ…not that it's relevant Â– it's just probably thrown in as "you simply can't trust a smoker" I'm assuming. In addition, the end revolutions, when both Chad Â– who explains his motivations, and Howard who, well, shouts his, also make it worthy of a complete viewing. And finally: Edwards who plays Christine, is really NOT deaf in real life, so her acting and "speech" is truly impressive. Listen to the audio commentary. This is real acting. It's not fast paced and it's based on the stereotypical movie "lie" approach that always leads to the clich&eacute; revolutionary scene, but it's interesting as a "yeah, this could really happen" story and the actual climax is quite fulfilling. Eckhart is so good in this role; you almost root for him, despite his evil intentions. The writing is good enough to see he did place his pieces (people) in the exact locations he wanted them and that's not pulled off by most actors. I do love super-human characters that use people as pawns. Stone did it brilliantly in Basic Instinct and Eckhart proved he could almost (give it about 80%) match her. Only, some of his scenes Â– such as, show me your balls Â– were a little off-kilter. As was his character.

    Engrossing and fascinating, if uncompromisingly nasty, film from provocateur Neil LaBute. Two businessmen, one alpha male, the other paunchy wimp, play with the emotions of a deaf coworker as a way to vent their own frustrations about work, sex -- and just about everything else about being human. The resulting film is angry and predictably uncomfortable to watch, but the compelling writing and performances are enough to keep you engaged. This was the first film to introduce me to the considerable talents of Aaron Eckhart, a chronically underrated actor. Grade: A-

    Early in the movie the premise of the story line is made clear. Two Yuppie businessmen away on a project in a branch office are discussing their relationships with women. They tell each other how badly they have treated them and how downtrodden they feel. This leads one of them to come up with a plan, which he convinces the other fellow to join in with him. They will find unsuspecting, susceptible young woman during the six weeks that are away. They will each wine, dine and romance her simultaneously and then both will dump her and leave town. As one of them puts it, in the future no matter how badly they are treated by girlfriends, their wives or even their bosses, they will look back and know that nobody treated them as badly as they were going to treat this women. Nice guys? Now what does this movie show us? What insight into the human mind or into the mind of some subtype of men can we glean? Well, they carry out the plan albeit with some complications. When she realizes what was done to her, the young woman says to one of the men, "Why did you do this?" He answers, "Because I could?" Does that line sound familiar? Although the line became famous a few years after this movie was made Bill Clinton is the person who immortalized those words in response to a question from Dan Rather in a 60 Minute TV interview as to why he had his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton replied, "I think I did something for the worst possible reason-just because I could. I think that's the most, just about the most morally indefensible reason that anybody could have for doing anything. When you do something just because you couldÂ… I've thought about it a lot. And there are lots of more sophisticated explanations, more complicated psychological explanations. But none of them are an excuse." Those psychological reasons may vary from person to person and there were two male characters in the movie and of course Clinton is a character himself. In some there is a core of self-centeredness or narcissism, some of which may make you a good leader or a boss but too much of it will be a disaster. Then in some individuals there is a great insecurity, which can include jealousy and aggression. We saw a mixture of these in our characters in the movie. Director Neil LaBute made the six week time span move quickly and actors Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy were excellent. Although the performance of Stacy Edwards was also top notch, there was controversy in some circles who thought that a real deaf actress should have played the part. We should have mentioned that the susceptible attractive young women who was to be dumped had lost her hearing at age 8 and had a speech impairment. Some may find this movie very thought provoking. Hopefully it won't be too close to home.

    Here we have corporate culture at its worst in the 90s; two men, a decade out of college, going city to city and making their money by giving presentations and telling others what to do. It's a high-pressure job with what appears to be small reward. Both Chad and Howard are slowly becoming fed up as they see younger men rise quicker and with less work ethic; they see their wives and girlfriends leave them without warning, breaking their hearts as their souls are destroyed in the workplace. It has become too much for Chad and he is looking for revenge. What better way to do so than at the demise of a girl, the fairer sex in which he says is composed of women "all the same, meat and gristle and hatred just simmering"? What if they could lead on some poor soul who has reached a point in her life where the prospect of a relationship or a future full of love is unattainable and than destroy her for sport to watch the reaction? Hell, they'll always be able to tell each other afterwards, "They never got me the way we got her". The writing is cynical and witty; this is one of the blackest comedies you will ever view. I literally felt bad laughing at times, but it is constructed so smartly, you just can't help yourself. Howard is a wormy romantic who knows Chad, the epitome of alpha male, from college and has stayed close through the years. He would never partake in a game such as this if not for the tale of his stronger buddy being cleaned out by his girl, even having the frame around his American Gigolo poster taken from him. If the sort of heartbreak Howard feels can happen to his friend too, well than maybe the female race deserves to be taught a lesson; unfortunately for temp Christine, that exercise will be brought upon her in full. She is the perfect fodder for their six week revenge plan, not only is she attractive, but she is deaf. Handicapped to the point where she wears headphones to appear distracted when unable to hear someone walk by, she is so far removed from the dating scene that the advances of two successful men in the office may just be too strong for her to pass up. Both men work together to show her so much affection that she will have to fall for at least one. Love, however, wasn't anticipated to play a role in the proceedings. As the weeks advance, the dates become more intimate, the bonds stronger. Sitting and watching the advancement starts to make it tough to discern true motivations. Are Chad and Howard really falling for her or are they that good at pretending in order to make the breakup as devastating as possible? Howard may not be getting as close physically to the girl, but his actions express a longing and need to be with her. Chad, on the other hand, working his magic and getting her in bed, has acquired the phrase he's been working towards, having her tell him she loves him. He responds in kind, but is it real? We will have to wait and see in week six whether the game has gone too far or whether it has gone just as planned. That statement may seem cruel, because the fact the ruse began at all means it went too farÂ—they are playing with an innocent's emotions and heart for sportÂ—but in the context of the film, you do start to buy into it and want to see what kind of fallout will result. LaBute does come from the stage and it shows here in his first film as most scenes are constructed from long takes and static setups. One moment on the rooftop has Chad almost flub a line, but they keep going, either to keep a sense of realism or save money on reshooting the exchange. Definitely shot on the cheap, it becomes the job of the actors to perform at the highest level, and they do not disappoint. Stacy Edwards is amazing as Christine, both in her portrayal of a deaf woman and in the emotional turmoil she must go through from start to finish. Also remember too, see is deceiving them by going out with both at the same time, selfishly keeping her own happiness above them knowing the truth. But it is Matt Malloy and Aaron Eckhart, as Howard and Chad respectively, that really carry the film. Malloy is a ball of nerves and insecurities, yet when he needs to be, either lying to the girl or venting to his friend, can compose himself to a man of power and force. Needing incentive to be confident, it is in him, but the moments where his insecurities rear their head shine above all else; never able to control the situation, he slowly devolves into a version of Chad. Chad, conversely, doesn't have a weak bone to his name. He says at the end that he can sell anyone, and it is true. The lines he utters are pure gold and I can see why it was hard for him to get work early in his career. Eckhart played a prick so well, no one wanted the controversy surrounding this role to take anything away from the new work. He is so conniving, so manipulative, yet with a smile that can charm us all. This film exists due to his performance and the revelations at the conclusion only cement him as one of the best screen villains ever. I'd love to see this story on stage, because The Shape of Things blew away its brilliant screen counterpart when I saw a college production, and I can only imagine watching this acted out in front of me would do the same if not more.

    After watching "In The Company of Men" it left me with an awful taste in my mouth. But at the same time it was a great movie watching experience as we examine the more lower depths of how inhumane we can really be as a society and yet still somehow manage to get with doing our actions. The strange irony is that this film runs at very unreasonable levels. The two leading male characters are couple of hateful humans that it in-spite of their wicked demeanour, I still seemed quite intrigued as what will transpire between these characters. Neil LaBute who wrote and directed this film gave freedom to the movie to just let things flow and avoids it from being preachy or overly moralizing. To me it makes this comedy all the more darker and at the same time more effective too. This tale focuses on a businessman named Chard (Aaron Eckhart), who without hesitation brutally confesses to his friend Howard (Matt Malloy) how much he despises all that is female. So then Chard persuades Howard into a scheming plot in which they're lead on a vulnerable woman and eventually when all is said and done, he will dump her. Chad's reason is a vicious plot at revenge due to the ways women have treated men. Chad assumes that their six-week hiatus to a satellite office is the perfect facility to carry this cruel scheme and while at that take the time to make a mockery on this poor victim at her expense. Howard himself goes along with the scheme feeling that this master-plan will backfire and through self-obligation, sides with Chad to see what will transpire. The plan starts to materialize as the lab rat for this scheme is a naive, shy secretary named Christine (Stacy Edwards) who works at the satellite office who is also deaf. The whole film, Chad and Howard take turns charming Christine, while that's progressing, their scheme starts to get out of control and takes its turns in expected turn of events. The manipulative schemes the men have on poor Christine are very deceitful that it's hard to watch at times. In the case of Chad, the plot is an attempt to emerge victorious as a ploy to further express his disdain to the female gender. Howard feels this scheme is unlawful, it more like to be aware of what's inside looking out instead of vice-versa. The audience and even Hoawrd himself know this plot will not work out. In most movies and T.V. shows they never do. But it's still intriguing in how this plan will come crashing down on them. And we hope that there might be a small fragment of humanity between Chad and Howard. Sure the outcome is predictable, but it's still fun to watch how it will backfire. The reason for dark comedy isn't the jokes or the action by the leading stars, but the laughter rests in the vicinity of what lengths people will go to to express how hateful we as human race truly are. The character-driven film scores high points in terms of depth. In addition to that it makes us reconsider our actions by what we say and do I'm glad that Mr. LaBute ended the film with a moral lesson or a perfectly wrapped happy ending. In the end in this case, the antagonist comes out the winner. And in the real world, bad people usually end up victorious in many situations. Granted Chad is a handsome individual and can wow the ladies with his charm quite easily. But at the same time time he's hypocritical, obnoxious and quite the condescending person who looks a nice person you want to punch in the mouth with. But he is still easy to identify with. There are a lot of Chad's out there And yet you feel sick to your stomach because you understand the psyche of this character so in the end I'm the jerk that has the egg on his face. The whole Chad, Howard and Christine love factor has some noteworthy things of interest here. You have two to put it loosely gentlemen of contrasting backgrounds. You have Chad, the handsome, suave ladies man, and then you have Howard who comes across as socially awkward who like most people of his kind in society are the one's who never come out on top (me included). And it's obvious Christine chooses the suave one over the awkward one. Matt Malloy was excellent portraying Howard. At fist he come across as an introverted individual. However, in the pivotal scenes in the end, it's a breath of fresh air when he lashes out when his buttons are pushed. Once the dust settles, we find these two jerks madly in love with Christine being the unlucky victim due to her being deaf. Both fall victim to the metaphoric love potion. Chad is at a loss of words to admit he loves her while Howard feels short that lost in a situation where he should have won. But in spite of the shortcomings within the characters, it is a wonderful character-driven story that might be hard to swallow in some situations.

    Neil Labute's "In The Company of Men" stars Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy as Chad and Howard, a pair of mid-level corporate executives sent to a boring regional branch for six weeks on a short term project. Frustrated, recently burnt by women, stuck in a career rut and high on corporate testosterone, the duo hatch a plan. "Let's hurt somebody," alpha-male Chad says. Pretty soon they're cooking up a Machiavellian scheme to locate an insecure woman, date her simultaneously, and dump her in the most vicious way possible. The woman they set their sights on is handicapped co-worker Christine. Christine has a speech impediment, but what she says doesn't matter to Chad anyway. Denied a voice, Chad handles her like an object to be acquired, traded, owned and discarded. Labute is heavily influenced by David Mamet. Most of the film finds Chad spewing corporate maxims, strutting about like a Master of the Universe and forcing co-workers to grovel at his feet. Eventually its revealed that Chad's scheming extends even to his "friend" Howard. He's your classic Extreme Sociopath, charming but endlessly manipulative. Everyone's his puppet. And as with Mamet's "workplace flicks", Chad's less a character than an extreme manifestation of a corporate logic whose drive for profit, ownership and expansion slowly infects how everyone around him thinks, acts and feels. Eventually Chad becomes both a norm and standard to aspire to. He's the new hypermasculinist ideal, for whom humiliation, domination, degradation, exploitation and suffering conflate with success. It's not only that aggressive competition in business affects masculinity, romance and sexual behaviour, but that corporate logic magnifies power, the ego and sanctions what is essentially various forms of rape. This stance is the opposite of how contemporary ideology is (mis)perceived, in which "business" is seen to be "neutral" and "mutually beneficial". Chad's a character who's popped up in many films and stories. More interesting is Howard, a fairly meek guy who is corrupted and made to do things even more horrible than Chad. The real world is made up of Howards. Chad's the anomaly, existing always more as spirit or underlying drive. La Bute penned "The Shape of Things" as an attempt to reverse the gender roles of "Company". Arguably his best film, it's also part of a tight trilogy by Labute about people's perceptions of physicality ("Fat Pig", "Reasons to be Pretty", "Shape of Things"). Massive spoilers ahead. "The Shape of Things" initially unfolds like a conventional romantic comedy. We're introduced to a dishevelled English Literature student called Adam, played by the always likable Paul Rudd, and an attractive art student called Evelyn (Rachel Weisz). The film then becomes a modern version of Adam's seduction by Eve. Eve ensnares Adam, manipulates him into becoming "fit", "attractive" and "healthy", and then reveals that she has never had romantic feelings toward him; she was merely using Adam as a sort of living art installation, a clay puppet, deceptively sculpting and moulding his mind and body. When Eve reveals her scheme to Adam Â– she invites him to an art installation in which he is quite literally presented as an exhibited object, her gaze now likened to the masculinist gaze of "In The Company of Men" - he's dumbfounded. Eve's tricked him into getting cosmetic surgery and altering his personality and physique. She's reconstructed him. Treated him as a chunk of malleable flesh. Unlike "Company", we're then invited to work our way through the messy ethical minefield of the victimiser's actions. For while Chad deservedly gets no sympathy in "Company", the relationship in "Things" is much harder to work out. Is Adam now a better person? Was Eve's love, no matter how virtual, beneficial to Adam? Was it ever real? How much authority should be given, or do we give, to artists? How much ethical responsibility do they hold or exercise? How do power relationships within romantic couples overlap with the power we grant artists? Don't Eve's actions echo the sexism of "Compny"? What is acceptable artistic material? Do the means, in art, justify the ends? At what point does creation become manipulation, is manipulation ever justified and at what point does creation destroy (see "Vertigo")? Is Adam now a beautiful work of "art" despite Eve's actions? How do Eve's actions differ from other vampiric artists, who take from and/or abuse outside sources? What does the film say about romance and the lover's desire to alter their partner? Art may be made by monsters, but what about the audience who enjoys? And on and on it goes. The film features a shot of the sentence "There is no morality in art". The quote's by Chinese novelist Han Suiyin, and is stencilled over Eve's art gallery. Throughout the film Eve articulates a similarly postmodern stance: "it's all subjective", she says, "moralists have no place in an art gallery". The firm itself is structured, we think, as an artist's apologia. Its first scene portrays Eve as an iconoclast who thrice breaks the rules, stepping over a rope at a museum, taking an illegal photograph of a sculpture and painting a penis onto a statue which has been censored by uptight museum curators. "You stepped over the line, Miss," curator Adam prophetically says when he firsts meets her. But as Eve makes clear, there should be no lines. We agree with her for much of the film. Afterall, hasn't she liberated Adam? By the film's end, however, we're asked to reconsider Eve's stance. Labute himself reconfigures Han Suiyin's quote. It's not that "there is no morality in art", in the sense that morality should not apply to art, but more literally, that "there is now, no longer, morality in art". Artists have no ethical compass, social feeling or attachment toward world, community or fellowman. Such art doesn't only exist in a vacuum, but is inherently selfish and nihilistic. You know, like Chad. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Almost every line and every scene in this tight, aggressive film is purposeful. Aaron Eckhart's performance as Chad is relaxed, controlled, and indifferently sadistic without being brutal. Matt Malloy's performance as Howard is absolutely necessary to the success of the film. The audience is never supposed to respect Howard, and Malloy commits unflinchingly to the role. Howard, in the end, discovers that he has been purposelessly led by his own weakness to want vindication for his ego--instead, he becomes a pathetic imitation of a romantic hero for a moral purpose he pretended to ignore. Some of the script suffers from believability. The beginning of the film, when Howard is slapped for asking a woman the time, is pretty unreasonable. If the film is (even an implicit) argument that women provoke men to be cruel, it proceeds from a false premise. The story boils down to the simple logic that Chad can manipulate and destroy Howard because Howard believes he's able to manipulate and destroy someone else. I envision Chad as a kind of false Satan--a man who pretends to be against God and morality solely for the purpose of seducing and destroying the lives of characters who believe in him. "How does it feel to really hurt someone?"

    In the Company of Men is a movie that makes one consider his or her actions after watching. The film puts the human conscience to the test by illustrating an exaggerated example of how heartless people can be at times. The film centered around three main characters. Aaron Eckhart played Chad, the arrogant, back-stabbing and ruthless bad guy. Christine, played by Stacy Edwards, was the first of Chad's "victims" of cruelty. Matt Malloy played Howard, a man who thought Chad was his friend. In early portions of the film, the theme appears to be revenge upon women by scorned men. However, as the plot thickens, the true theme of the film reveals itself. It turns out that Chad is planning to hurt anyone he can. The real theme of the film is that some people care about only themselves. Chad is a classic case of one of those people. Throughout the film, he carefully executes a plan to hurt Christine, a deaf woman who has not dated in a long time, due to her handicap. He uses Howard to help in the act of hurting Christine. Chad eventually accomplishes his main goal. However, Howard develops feelings for Christine and tells her that he and Chad had set out to hurt her from the beginning. He also tells her that he has fallen in love with her, although she never gives him a chance to prove that. As a result, Howard ends up being hurt as well. As the plan to hurt Christine comes to fruition, other subplots become evident. Smaller examples of the theme come to light. Chad organizes a series of events that lead to Howard being demoted from his position in the company he and Chad work for. It was no coincidence that Chad eventually was promoted to Howard's position. As the viewer watches Chad's plans unfold, certain elements of film production can be detected as enhancers of the theme. For example, the music between scenes is bold and loud. It gives one the impression that something ominous is going to happen. The music seems to create an element of building tension. One anticipates a huge event of a bad nature. The camera angles chosen for many of the scenes make Chad seem very powerful and evil. The scenes that use upward views of Chad and Howard together are particularly persuasive toward creating this impression. The various angles used in the date scenes between Chad and Christine further emphasize Chad's lack of conscience. The theme of this film, and the execution of the theme, is very similar to that found in The Usual Suspects. Both films focus on a character that is deceiving people purposely. They are also similar, in that the "villain" is not found out by the other characters until the end of the movie. The only difference is that Chad is not so eager to get away clean with his acts. He seems to be proud of his actions, and willingly tells Howard what he has done. This film's theme is one that makes some consider their actions, while it makes others strive to achieve such power. The effect it has on you should say something about the kind of person you are. It made me consider how awful it feels to be hurt. Those involved in making this film have put together a powerful piece that, while lacking in action, forces people to examine themselves and others.

    Misogynist Film of the Moment: In the Company of Men 3 11 2009 I just watched one of the worst movies ever. I share my opinion only because I want you to watch it as well and see if you relate or if you are repulsed. Some of you might've seen it before. The title sounded familiar and its for that reason that I let the movie take my evening away from me. There was an award given to the filmmaker. It was released in 1997. I usually don't blast movies because they are supposed to leave you in a mood. The director and writer don't do a good job of portraying the comedy to this dark comedy though, and as a result it comes off as a serious film, and leaves a bad taste in the viewers mouth. Do not let your girlfriends watch this movie. It will only add to the man hate already happening. This is fuel to the fire. That said, if you do watch it, try to figure out which of the two guys you are more like, Chad or Howard, and get back at me. I might have to start a new column where I share these discoveries with you. This is an insult to misogynists everywhere. Not approved. In The Company Of Men ----Ryan Mega sexdrugsmoney.com

    Chad is a perfect example of a sociopath/psychopath, someone who is amoral, takes risks in his personal and work life, is utterly charming when he is working on someone, but cold and and cruel when he no longer needs them. I thought this film was a brilliant portrayal of the psychopath and how he draws in his victims. Lying is second nature to him, he takes everything in his stride because he has no emotional response to anything that transpires. Chad is in control and it is almost hypnotic to see him manipulate those around him. There was another thread running through the story, the office politics, and Howard appeared to have missed what was really happening - just like a real life victim, he would not have realised just how evil Chad is. Definitely one for my collection of films about psychos.

    I remember seeing In the Company of Men a very long time agoÂ…not sure exactly when, but it was when I began noticing independent films verses big budgeted all-name films. And I loved it. It was a refreshing change from explosions every few minutes. Unfortunately, times have changed. Yeah, I still like the film Â– I am a sucker for "super-human" characters, and Chad (Eckhart) certainly is. But, now my eyes opened, recently, to pacing and movies that overstay their welcomes. Don't give up on this movie, however. It's a somewhat original idea with excellent acting from Eckhart as an, excuse my English, asshole whose main purpose is to see people suffer for mere amusement. Here we have two "gentlemen," Howard (Malloy) and Chad who work together Â– one being the boss, though they graduated close to each other, and are sent for six weeks to an undisclosed city to set up their sales business. In a little down time Â– as few and far between it is, Howard admits to his buddy that he's been recently dumped by his girlfriend. Chad retorts with his story of love-lost with his girlfriend and then proposes the idea of the movie: revenge against women. Chad wants to find that special nobody, and have both him and Howard date her, romance her, make her feel like she's on top of the world and then simply pull the rug out and laugh as she falls. Sounds cruel? Well, yeahÂ…there's no other way to describe it. However, it gets worse; the one they pick, Christine (Edwards) is deaf. They do what they set out to. But, unfortunately for the movie's sake: they make it painfully obvious that one will fall (for her,) one will rise and the end result is what you expect. What holds the movie together and makes it worth a viewing is Eckhart as Chad. He's evil. He's borderline Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct) but he's somewhat more despicable than Stone, because he makes this all the more real. Also, they both smoke like a chimneyÂ…not that it's relevant Â– it's just probably thrown in as "you simply can't trust a smoker" I'm assuming. In addition, the end revolutions, when both Chad Â– who explains his motivations, and Howard who, well, shouts his, also make it worthy of a complete viewing. And finally: Edwards who plays Christine, is really NOT deaf in real life, so her acting and "speech" is truly impressive. Listen to the audio commentary. This is real acting. It's not fast paced and it's based on the stereotypical movie "lie" approach that always leads to the clich&eacute; revolutionary scene, but it's interesting as a "yeah, this could really happen" story and the actual climax is quite fulfilling. Eckhart is so good in this role; you almost root for him, despite his evil intentions. The writing is good enough to see he did place his pieces (people) in the exact locations he wanted them and that's not pulled off by most actors. I do love super-human characters that use people as pawns. Stone did it brilliantly in Basic Instinct and Eckhart proved he could almost (give it about 80%) match her. Only, some of his scenes Â– such as, show me your balls Â– were a little off-kilter. As was his character.

    Engrossing and fascinating, if uncompromisingly nasty, film from provocateur Neil LaBute. Two businessmen, one alpha male, the other paunchy wimp, play with the emotions of a deaf coworker as a way to vent their own frustrations about work, sex -- and just about everything else about being human. The resulting film is angry and predictably uncomfortable to watch, but the compelling writing and performances are enough to keep you engaged. This was the first film to introduce me to the considerable talents of Aaron Eckhart, a chronically underrated actor. Grade: A-

    Early in the movie the premise of the story line is made clear. Two Yuppie businessmen away on a project in a branch office are discussing their relationships with women. They tell each other how badly they have treated them and how downtrodden they feel. This leads one of them to come up with a plan, which he convinces the other fellow to join in with him. They will find unsuspecting, susceptible young woman during the six weeks that are away. They will each wine, dine and romance her simultaneously and then both will dump her and leave town. As one of them puts it, in the future no matter how badly they are treated by girlfriends, their wives or even their bosses, they will look back and know that nobody treated them as badly as they were going to treat this women. Nice guys? Now what does this movie show us? What insight into the human mind or into the mind of some subtype of men can we glean? Well, they carry out the plan albeit with some complications. When she realizes what was done to her, the young woman says to one of the men, "Why did you do this?" He answers, "Because I could?" Does that line sound familiar? Although the line became famous a few years after this movie was made Bill Clinton is the person who immortalized those words in response to a question from Dan Rather in a 60 Minute TV interview as to why he had his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton replied, "I think I did something for the worst possible reason-just because I could. I think that's the most, just about the most morally indefensible reason that anybody could have for doing anything. When you do something just because you couldÂ… I've thought about it a lot. And there are lots of more sophisticated explanations, more complicated psychological explanations. But none of them are an excuse." Those psychological reasons may vary from person to person and there were two male characters in the movie and of course Clinton is a character himself. In some there is a core of self-centeredness or narcissism, some of which may make you a good leader or a boss but too much of it will be a disaster. Then in some individuals there is a great insecurity, which can include jealousy and aggression. We saw a mixture of these in our characters in the movie. Director Neil LaBute made the six week time span move quickly and actors Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy were excellent. Although the performance of Stacy Edwards was also top notch, there was controversy in some circles who thought that a real deaf actress should have played the part. We should have mentioned that the susceptible attractive young women who was to be dumped had lost her hearing at age 8 and had a speech impairment. Some may find this movie very thought provoking. Hopefully it won't be too close to home.

    Here we have corporate culture at its worst in the 90s; two men, a decade out of college, going city to city and making their money by giving presentations and telling others what to do. It's a high-pressure job with what appears to be small reward. Both Chad and Howard are slowly becoming fed up as they see younger men rise quicker and with less work ethic; they see their wives and girlfriends leave them without warning, breaking their hearts as their souls are destroyed in the workplace. It has become too much for Chad and he is looking for revenge. What better way to do so than at the demise of a girl, the fairer sex in which he says is composed of women "all the same, meat and gristle and hatred just simmering"? What if they could lead on some poor soul who has reached a point in her life where the prospect of a relationship or a future full of love is unattainable and than destroy her for sport to watch the reaction? Hell, they'll always be able to tell each other afterwards, "They never got me the way we got her". The writing is cynical and witty; this is one of the blackest comedies you will ever view. I literally felt bad laughing at times, but it is constructed so smartly, you just can't help yourself. Howard is a wormy romantic who knows Chad, the epitome of alpha male, from college and has stayed close through the years. He would never partake in a game such as this if not for the tale of his stronger buddy being cleaned out by his girl, even having the frame around his American Gigolo poster taken from him. If the sort of heartbreak Howard feels can happen to his friend too, well than maybe the female race deserves to be taught a lesson; unfortunately for temp Christine, that exercise will be brought upon her in full. She is the perfect fodder for their six week revenge plan, not only is she attractive, but she is deaf. Handicapped to the point where she wears headphones to appear distracted when unable to hear someone walk by, she is so far removed from the dating scene that the advances of two successful men in the office may just be too strong for her to pass up. Both men work together to show her so much affection that she will have to fall for at least one. Love, however, wasn't anticipated to play a role in the proceedings. As the weeks advance, the dates become more intimate, the bonds stronger. Sitting and watching the advancement starts to make it tough to discern true motivations. Are Chad and Howard really falling for her or are they that good at pretending in order to make the breakup as devastating as possible? Howard may not be getting as close physically to the girl, but his actions express a longing and need to be with her. Chad, on the other hand, working his magic and getting her in bed, has acquired the phrase he's been working towards, having her tell him she loves him. He responds in kind, but is it real? We will have to wait and see in week six whether the game has gone too far or whether it has gone just as planned. That statement may seem cruel, because the fact the ruse began at all means it went too farÂ—they are playing with an innocent's emotions and heart for sportÂ—but in the context of the film, you do start to buy into it and want to see what kind of fallout will result. LaBute does come from the stage and it shows here in his first film as most scenes are constructed from long takes and static setups. One moment on the rooftop has Chad almost flub a line, but they keep going, either to keep a sense of realism or save money on reshooting the exchange. Definitely shot on the cheap, it becomes the job of the actors to perform at the highest level, and they do not disappoint. Stacy Edwards is amazing as Christine, both in her portrayal of a deaf woman and in the emotional turmoil she must go through from start to finish. Also remember too, see is deceiving them by going out with both at the same time, selfishly keeping her own happiness above them knowing the truth. But it is Matt Malloy and Aaron Eckhart, as Howard and Chad respectively, that really carry the film. Malloy is a ball of nerves and insecurities, yet when he needs to be, either lying to the girl or venting to his friend, can compose himself to a man of power and force. Needing incentive to be confident, it is in him, but the moments where his insecurities rear their head shine above all else; never able to control the situation, he slowly devolves into a version of Chad. Chad, conversely, doesn't have a weak bone to his name. He says at the end that he can sell anyone, and it is true. The lines he utters are pure gold and I can see why it was hard for him to get work early in his career. Eckhart played a prick so well, no one wanted the controversy surrounding this role to take anything away from the new work. He is so conniving, so manipulative, yet with a smile that can charm us all. This film exists due to his performance and the revelations at the conclusion only cement him as one of the best screen villains ever. I'd love to see this story on stage, because The Shape of Things blew away its brilliant screen counterpart when I saw a college production, and I can only imagine watching this acted out in front of me would do the same if not more.

    After watching "In The Company of Men" it left me with an awful taste in my mouth. But at the same time it was a great movie watching experience as we examine the more lower depths of how inhumane we can really be as a society and yet still somehow manage to get with doing our actions. The strange irony is that this film runs at very unreasonable levels. The two leading male characters are couple of hateful humans that it in-spite of their wicked demeanour, I still seemed quite intrigued as what will transpire between these characters. Neil LaBute who wrote and directed this film gave freedom to the movie to just let things flow and avoids it from being preachy or overly moralizing. To me it makes this comedy all the more darker and at the same time more effective too. This tale focuses on a businessman named Chard (Aaron Eckhart), who without hesitation brutally confesses to his friend Howard (Matt Malloy) how much he despises all that is female. So then Chard persuades Howard into a scheming plot in which they're lead on a vulnerable woman and eventually when all is said and done, he will dump her. Chad's reason is a vicious plot at revenge due to the ways women have treated men. Chad assumes that their six-week hiatus to a satellite office is the perfect facility to carry this cruel scheme and while at that take the time to make a mockery on this poor victim at her expense. Howard himself goes along with the scheme feeling that this master-plan will backfire and through self-obligation, sides with Chad to see what will transpire. The plan starts to materialize as the lab rat for this scheme is a naive, shy secretary named Christine (Stacy Edwards) who works at the satellite office who is also deaf. The whole film, Chad and Howard take turns charming Christine, while that's progressing, their scheme starts to get out of control and takes its turns in expected turn of events. The manipulative schemes the men have on poor Christine are very deceitful that it's hard to watch at times. In the case of Chad, the plot is an attempt to emerge victorious as a ploy to further express his disdain to the female gender. Howard feels this scheme is unlawful, it more like to be aware of what's inside looking out instead of vice-versa. The audience and even Hoawrd himself know this plot will not work out. In most movies and T.V. shows they never do. But it's still intriguing in how this plan will come crashing down on them. And we hope that there might be a small fragment of humanity between Chad and Howard. Sure the outcome is predictable, but it's still fun to watch how it will backfire. The reason for dark comedy isn't the jokes or the action by the leading stars, but the laughter rests in the vicinity of what lengths people will go to to express how hateful we as human race truly are. The character-driven film scores high points in terms of depth. In addition to that it makes us reconsider our actions by what we say and do I'm glad that Mr. LaBute ended the film with a moral lesson or a perfectly wrapped happy ending. In the end in this case, the antagonist comes out the winner. And in the real world, bad people usually end up victorious in many situations. Granted Chad is a handsome individual and can wow the ladies with his charm quite easily. But at the same time time he's hypocritical, obnoxious and quite the condescending person who looks a nice person you want to punch in the mouth with. But he is still easy to identify with. There are a lot of Chad's out there And yet you feel sick to your stomach because you understand the psyche of this character so in the end I'm the jerk that has the egg on his face. The whole Chad, Howard and Christine love factor has some noteworthy things of interest here. You have two to put it loosely gentlemen of contrasting backgrounds. You have Chad, the handsome, suave ladies man, and then you have Howard who comes across as socially awkward who like most people of his kind in society are the one's who never come out on top (me included). And it's obvious Christine chooses the suave one over the awkward one. Matt Malloy was excellent portraying Howard. At fist he come across as an introverted individual. However, in the pivotal scenes in the end, it's a breath of fresh air when he lashes out when his buttons are pushed. Once the dust settles, we find these two jerks madly in love with Christine being the unlucky victim due to her being deaf. Both fall victim to the metaphoric love potion. Chad is at a loss of words to admit he loves her while Howard feels short that lost in a situation where he should have won. But in spite of the shortcomings within the characters, it is a wonderful character-driven story that might be hard to swallow in some situations.

    Neil Labute's "In The Company of Men" stars Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy as Chad and Howard, a pair of mid-level corporate executives sent to a boring regional branch for six weeks on a short term project. Frustrated, recently burnt by women, stuck in a career rut and high on corporate testosterone, the duo hatch a plan. "Let's hurt somebody," alpha-male Chad says. Pretty soon they're cooking up a Machiavellian scheme to locate an insecure woman, date her simultaneously, and dump her in the most vicious way possible. The woman they set their sights on is handicapped co-worker Christine. Christine has a speech impediment, but what she says doesn't matter to Chad anyway. Denied a voice, Chad handles her like an object to be acquired, traded, owned and discarded. Labute is heavily influenced by David Mamet. Most of the film finds Chad spewing corporate maxims, strutting about like a Master of the Universe and forcing co-workers to grovel at his feet. Eventually its revealed that Chad's scheming extends even to his "friend" Howard. He's your classic Extreme Sociopath, charming but endlessly manipulative. Everyone's his puppet. And as with Mamet's "workplace flicks", Chad's less a character than an extreme manifestation of a corporate logic whose drive for profit, ownership and expansion slowly infects how everyone around him thinks, acts and feels. Eventually Chad becomes both a norm and standard to aspire to. He's the new hypermasculinist ideal, for whom humiliation, domination, degradation, exploitation and suffering conflate with success. It's not only that aggressive competition in business affects masculinity, romance and sexual behaviour, but that corporate logic magnifies power, the ego and sanctions what is essentially various forms of rape. This stance is the opposite of how contemporary ideology is (mis)perceived, in which "business" is seen to be "neutral" and "mutually beneficial". Chad's a character who's popped up in many films and stories. More interesting is Howard, a fairly meek guy who is corrupted and made to do things even more horrible than Chad. The real world is made up of Howards. Chad's the anomaly, existing always more as spirit or underlying drive. La Bute penned "The Shape of Things" as an attempt to reverse the gender roles of "Company". Arguably his best film, it's also part of a tight trilogy by Labute about people's perceptions of physicality ("Fat Pig", "Reasons to be Pretty", "Shape of Things"). Massive spoilers ahead. "The Shape of Things" initially unfolds like a conventional romantic comedy. We're introduced to a dishevelled English Literature student called Adam, played by the always likable Paul Rudd, and an attractive art student called Evelyn (Rachel Weisz). The film then becomes a modern version of Adam's seduction by Eve. Eve ensnares Adam, manipulates him into becoming "fit", "attractive" and "healthy", and then reveals that she has never had romantic feelings toward him; she was merely using Adam as a sort of living art installation, a clay puppet, deceptively sculpting and moulding his mind and body. When Eve reveals her scheme to Adam Â– she invites him to an art installation in which he is quite literally presented as an exhibited object, her gaze now likened to the masculinist gaze of "In The Company of Men" - he's dumbfounded. Eve's tricked him into getting cosmetic surgery and altering his personality and physique. She's reconstructed him. Treated him as a chunk of malleable flesh. Unlike "Company", we're then invited to work our way through the messy ethical minefield of the victimiser's actions. For while Chad deservedly gets no sympathy in "Company", the relationship in "Things" is much harder to work out. Is Adam now a better person? Was Eve's love, no matter how virtual, beneficial to Adam? Was it ever real? How much authority should be given, or do we give, to artists? How much ethical responsibility do they hold or exercise? How do power relationships within romantic couples overlap with the power we grant artists? Don't Eve's actions echo the sexism of "Compny"? What is acceptable artistic material? Do the means, in art, justify the ends? At what point does creation become manipulation, is manipulation ever justified and at what point does creation destroy (see "Vertigo")? Is Adam now a beautiful work of "art" despite Eve's actions? How do Eve's actions differ from other vampiric artists, who take from and/or abuse outside sources? What does the film say about romance and the lover's desire to alter their partner? Art may be made by monsters, but what about the audience who enjoys? And on and on it goes. The film features a shot of the sentence "There is no morality in art". The quote's by Chinese novelist Han Suiyin, and is stencilled over Eve's art gallery. Throughout the film Eve articulates a similarly postmodern stance: "it's all subjective", she says, "moralists have no place in an art gallery". The firm itself is structured, we think, as an artist's apologia. Its first scene portrays Eve as an iconoclast who thrice breaks the rules, stepping over a rope at a museum, taking an illegal photograph of a sculpture and painting a penis onto a statue which has been censored by uptight museum curators. "You stepped over the line, Miss," curator Adam prophetically says when he firsts meets her. But as Eve makes clear, there should be no lines. We agree with her for much of the film. Afterall, hasn't she liberated Adam? By the film's end, however, we're asked to reconsider Eve's stance. Labute himself reconfigures Han Suiyin's quote. It's not that "there is no morality in art", in the sense that morality should not apply to art, but more literally, that "there is now, no longer, morality in art". Artists have no ethical compass, social feeling or attachment toward world, community or fellowman. Such art doesn't only exist in a vacuum, but is inherently selfish and nihilistic. You know, like Chad. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Almost every line and every scene in this tight, aggressive film is purposeful. Aaron Eckhart's performance as Chad is relaxed, controlled, and indifferently sadistic without being brutal. Matt Malloy's performance as Howard is absolutely necessary to the success of the film. The audience is never supposed to respect Howard, and Malloy commits unflinchingly to the role. Howard, in the end, discovers that he has been purposelessly led by his own weakness to want vindication for his ego--instead, he becomes a pathetic imitation of a romantic hero for a moral purpose he pretended to ignore. Some of the script suffers from believability. The beginning of the film, when Howard is slapped for asking a woman the time, is pretty unreasonable. If the film is (even an implicit) argument that women provoke men to be cruel, it proceeds from a false premise. The story boils down to the simple logic that Chad can manipulate and destroy Howard because Howard believes he's able to manipulate and destroy someone else. I envision Chad as a kind of false Satan--a man who pretends to be against God and morality solely for the purpose of seducing and destroying the lives of characters who believe in him. "How does it feel to really hurt someone?"

    In the Company of Men is a movie that makes one consider his or her actions after watching. The film puts the human conscience to the test by illustrating an exaggerated example of how heartless people can be at times. The film centered around three main characters. Aaron Eckhart played Chad, the arrogant, back-stabbing and ruthless bad guy. Christine, played by Stacy Edwards, was the first of Chad's "victims" of cruelty. Matt Malloy played Howard, a man who thought Chad was his friend. In early portions of the film, the theme appears to be revenge upon women by scorned men. However, as the plot thickens, the true theme of the film reveals itself. It turns out that Chad is planning to hurt anyone he can. The real theme of the film is that some people care about only themselves. Chad is a classic case of one of those people. Throughout the film, he carefully executes a plan to hurt Christine, a deaf woman who has not dated in a long time, due to her handicap. He uses Howard to help in the act of hurting Christine. Chad eventually accomplishes his main goal. However, Howard develops feelings for Christine and tells her that he and Chad had set out to hurt her from the beginning. He also tells her that he has fallen in love with her, although she never gives him a chance to prove that. As a result, Howard ends up being hurt as well. As the plan to hurt Christine comes to fruition, other subplots become evident. Smaller examples of the theme come to light. Chad organizes a series of events that lead to Howard being demoted from his position in the company he and Chad work for. It was no coincidence that Chad eventually was promoted to Howard's position. As the viewer watches Chad's plans unfold, certain elements of film production can be detected as enhancers of the theme. For example, the music between scenes is bold and loud. It gives one the impression that something ominous is going to happen. The music seems to create an element of building tension. One anticipates a huge event of a bad nature. The camera angles chosen for many of the scenes make Chad seem very powerful and evil. The scenes that use upward views of Chad and Howard together are particularly persuasive toward creating this impression. The various angles used in the date scenes between Chad and Christine further emphasize Chad's lack of conscience. The theme of this film, and the execution of the theme, is very similar to that found in The Usual Suspects. Both films focus on a character that is deceiving people purposely. They are also similar, in that the "villain" is not found out by the other characters until the end of the movie. The only difference is that Chad is not so eager to get away clean with his acts. He seems to be proud of his actions, and willingly tells Howard what he has done. This film's theme is one that makes some consider their actions, while it makes others strive to achieve such power. The effect it has on you should say something about the kind of person you are. It made me consider how awful it feels to be hurt. Those involved in making this film have put together a powerful piece that, while lacking in action, forces people to examine themselves and others.

    Misogynist Film of the Moment: In the Company of Men 3 11 2009 I just watched one of the worst movies ever. I share my opinion only because I want you to watch it as well and see if you relate or if you are repulsed. Some of you might've seen it before. The title sounded familiar and its for that reason that I let the movie take my evening away from me. There was an award given to the filmmaker. It was released in 1997. I usually don't blast movies because they are supposed to leave you in a mood. The director and writer don't do a good job of portraying the comedy to this dark comedy though, and as a result it comes off as a serious film, and leaves a bad taste in the viewers mouth. Do not let your girlfriends watch this movie. It will only add to the man hate already happening. This is fuel to the fire. That said, if you do watch it, try to figure out which of the two guys you are more like, Chad or Howard, and get back at me. I might have to start a new column where I share these discoveries with you. This is an insult to misogynists everywhere. Not approved. In The Company Of Men ----Ryan Mega sexdrugsmoney.com

    Chad is a perfect example of a sociopath/psychopath, someone who is amoral, takes risks in his personal and work life, is utterly charming when he is working on someone, but cold and and cruel when he no longer needs them. I thought this film was a brilliant portrayal of the psychopath and how he draws in his victims. Lying is second nature to him, he takes everything in his stride because he has no emotional response to anything that transpires. Chad is in control and it is almost hypnotic to see him manipulate those around him. There was another thread running through the story, the office politics, and Howard appeared to have missed what was really happening - just like a real life victim, he would not have realised just how evil Chad is. Definitely one for my collection of films about psychos.

    I remember seeing In the Company of Men a very long time agoÂ…not sure exactly when, but it was when I began noticing independent films verses big budgeted all-name films. And I loved it. It was a refreshing change from explosions every few minutes. Unfortunately, times have changed. Yeah, I still like the film Â– I am a sucker for "super-human" characters, and Chad (Eckhart) certainly is. But, now my eyes opened, recently, to pacing and movies that overstay their welcomes. Don't give up on this movie, however. It's a somewhat original idea with excellent acting from Eckhart as an, excuse my English, asshole whose main purpose is to see people suffer for mere amusement. Here we have two "gentlemen," Howard (Malloy) and Chad who work together Â– one being the boss, though they graduated close to each other, and are sent for six weeks to an undisclosed city to set up their sales business. In a little down time Â– as few and far between it is, Howard admits to his buddy that he's been recently dumped by his girlfriend. Chad retorts with his story of love-lost with his girlfriend and then proposes the idea of the movie: revenge against women. Chad wants to find that special nobody, and have both him and Howard date her, romance her, make her feel like she's on top of the world and then simply pull the rug out and laugh as she falls. Sounds cruel? Well, yeahÂ…there's no other way to describe it. However, it gets worse; the one they pick, Christine (Edwards) is deaf. They do what they set out to. But, unfortunately for the movie's sake: they make it painfully obvious that one will fall (for her,) one will rise and the end result is what you expect. What holds the movie together and makes it worth a viewing is Eckhart as Chad. He's evil. He's borderline Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct) but he's somewhat more despicable than Stone, because he makes this all the more real. Also, they both smoke like a chimneyÂ…not that it's relevant Â– it's just probably thrown in as "you simply can't trust a smoker" I'm assuming. In addition, the end revolutions, when both Chad Â– who explains his motivations, and Howard who, well, shouts his, also make it worthy of a complete viewing. And finally: Edwards who plays Christine, is really NOT deaf in real life, so her acting and "speech" is truly impressive. Listen to the audio commentary. This is real acting. It's not fast paced and it's based on the stereotypical movie "lie" approach that always leads to the clich&eacute; revolutionary scene, but it's interesting as a "yeah, this could really happen" story and the actual climax is quite fulfilling. Eckhart is so good in this role; you almost root for him, despite his evil intentions. The writing is good enough to see he did place his pieces (people) in the exact locations he wanted them and that's not pulled off by most actors. I do love super-human characters that use people as pawns. Stone did it brilliantly in Basic Instinct and Eckhart proved he could almost (give it about 80%) match her. Only, some of his scenes Â– such as, show me your balls Â– were a little off-kilter. As was his character.

    Engrossing and fascinating, if uncompromisingly nasty, film from provocateur Neil LaBute. Two businessmen, one alpha male, the other paunchy wimp, play with the emotions of a deaf coworker as a way to vent their own frustrations about work, sex -- and just about everything else about being human. The resulting film is angry and predictably uncomfortable to watch, but the compelling writing and performances are enough to keep you engaged. This was the first film to introduce me to the considerable talents of Aaron Eckhart, a chronically underrated actor. Grade: A-

    Early in the movie the premise of the story line is made clear. Two Yuppie businessmen away on a project in a branch office are discussing their relationships with women. They tell each other how badly they have treated them and how downtrodden they feel. This leads one of them to come up with a plan, which he convinces the other fellow to join in with him. They will find unsuspecting, susceptible young woman during the six weeks that are away. They will each wine, dine and romance her simultaneously and then both will dump her and leave town. As one of them puts it, in the future no matter how badly they are treated by girlfriends, their wives or even their bosses, they will look back and know that nobody treated them as badly as they were going to treat this women. Nice guys? Now what does this movie show us? What insight into the human mind or into the mind of some subtype of men can we glean? Well, they carry out the plan albeit with some complications. When she realizes what was done to her, the young woman says to one of the men, "Why did you do this?" He answers, "Because I could?" Does that line sound familiar? Although the line became famous a few years after this movie was made Bill Clinton is the person who immortalized those words in response to a question from Dan Rather in a 60 Minute TV interview as to why he had his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton replied, "I think I did something for the worst possible reason-just because I could. I think that's the most, just about the most morally indefensible reason that anybody could have for doing anything. When you do something just because you couldÂ… I've thought about it a lot. And there are lots of more sophisticated explanations, more complicated psychological explanations. But none of them are an excuse." Those psychological reasons may vary from person to person and there were two male characters in the movie and of course Clinton is a character himself. In some there is a core of self-centeredness or narcissism, some of which may make you a good leader or a boss but too much of it will be a disaster. Then in some individuals there is a great insecurity, which can include jealousy and aggression. We saw a mixture of these in our characters in the movie. Director Neil LaBute made the six week time span move quickly and actors Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy were excellent. Although the performance of Stacy Edwards was also top notch, there was controversy in some circles who thought that a real deaf actress should have played the part. We should have mentioned that the susceptible attractive young women who was to be dumped had lost her hearing at age 8 and had a speech impairment. Some may find this movie very thought provoking. Hopefully it won't be too close to home.

    Here we have corporate culture at its worst in the 90s; two men, a decade out of college, going city to city and making their money by giving presentations and telling others what to do. It's a high-pressure job with what appears to be small reward. Both Chad and Howard are slowly becoming fed up as they see younger men rise quicker and with less work ethic; they see their wives and girlfriends leave them without warning, breaking their hearts as their souls are destroyed in the workplace. It has become too much for Chad and he is looking for revenge. What better way to do so than at the demise of a girl, the fairer sex in which he says is composed of women "all the same, meat and gristle and hatred just simmering"? What if they could lead on some poor soul who has reached a point in her life where the prospect of a relationship or a future full of love is unattainable and than destroy her for sport to watch the reaction? Hell, they'll always be able to tell each other afterwards, "They never got me the way we got her". The writing is cynical and witty; this is one of the blackest comedies you will ever view. I literally felt bad laughing at times, but it is constructed so smartly, you just can't help yourself. Howard is a wormy romantic who knows Chad, the epitome of alpha male, from college and has stayed close through the years. He would never partake in a game such as this if not for the tale of his stronger buddy being cleaned out by his girl, even having the frame around his American Gigolo poster taken from him. If the sort of heartbreak Howard feels can happen to his friend too, well than maybe the female race deserves to be taught a lesson; unfortunately for temp Christine, that exercise will be brought upon her in full. She is the perfect fodder for their six week revenge plan, not only is she attractive, but she is deaf. Handicapped to the point where she wears headphones to appear distracted when unable to hear someone walk by, she is so far removed from the dating scene that the advances of two successful men in the office may just be too strong for her to pass up. Both men work together to show her so much affection that she will have to fall for at least one. Love, however, wasn't anticipated to play a role in the proceedings. As the weeks advance, the dates become more intimate, the bonds stronger. Sitting and watching the advancement starts to make it tough to discern true motivations. Are Chad and Howard really falling for her or are they that good at pretending in order to make the breakup as devastating as possible? Howard may not be getting as close physically to the girl, but his actions express a longing and need to be with her. Chad, on the other hand, working his magic and getting her in bed, has acquired the phrase he's been working towards, having her tell him she loves him. He responds in kind, but is it real? We will have to wait and see in week six whether the game has gone too far or whether it has gone just as planned. That statement may seem cruel, because the fact the ruse began at all means it went too farÂ—they are playing with an innocent's emotions and heart for sportÂ—but in the context of the film, you do start to buy into it and want to see what kind of fallout will result. LaBute does come from the stage and it shows here in his first film as most scenes are constructed from long takes and static setups. One moment on the rooftop has Chad almost flub a line, but they keep going, either to keep a sense of realism or save money on reshooting the exchange. Definitely shot on the cheap, it becomes the job of the actors to perform at the highest level, and they do not disappoint. Stacy Edwards is amazing as Christine, both in her portrayal of a deaf woman and in the emotional turmoil she must go through from start to finish. Also remember too, see is deceiving them by going out with both at the same time, selfishly keeping her own happiness above them knowing the truth. But it is Matt Malloy and Aaron Eckhart, as Howard and Chad respectively, that really carry the film. Malloy is a ball of nerves and insecurities, yet when he needs to be, either lying to the girl or venting to his friend, can compose himself to a man of power and force. Needing incentive to be confident, it is in him, but the moments where his insecurities rear their head shine above all else; never able to control the situation, he slowly devolves into a version of Chad. Chad, conversely, doesn't have a weak bone to his name. He says at the end that he can sell anyone, and it is true. The lines he utters are pure gold and I can see why it was hard for him to get work early in his career. Eckhart played a prick so well, no one wanted the controversy surrounding this role to take anything away from the new work. He is so conniving, so manipulative, yet with a smile that can charm us all. This film exists due to his performance and the revelations at the conclusion only cement him as one of the best screen villains ever. I'd love to see this story on stage, because The Shape of Things blew away its brilliant screen counterpart when I saw a college production, and I can only imagine watching this acted out in front of me would do the same if not more.

    After watching "In The Company of Men" it left me with an awful taste in my mouth. But at the same time it was a great movie watching experience as we examine the more lower depths of how inhumane we can really be as a society and yet still somehow manage to get with doing our actions. The strange irony is that this film runs at very unreasonable levels. The two leading male characters are couple of hateful humans that it in-spite of their wicked demeanour, I still seemed quite intrigued as what will transpire between these characters. Neil LaBute who wrote and directed this film gave freedom to the movie to just let things flow and avoids it from being preachy or overly moralizing. To me it makes this comedy all the more darker and at the same time more effective too. This tale focuses on a businessman named Chard (Aaron Eckhart), who without hesitation brutally confesses to his friend Howard (Matt Malloy) how much he despises all that is female. So then Chard persuades Howard into a scheming plot in which they're lead on a vulnerable woman and eventually when all is said and done, he will dump her. Chad's reason is a vicious plot at revenge due to the ways women have treated men. Chad assumes that their six-week hiatus to a satellite office is the perfect facility to carry this cruel scheme and while at that take the time to make a mockery on this poor victim at her expense. Howard himself goes along with the scheme feeling that this master-plan will backfire and through self-obligation, sides with Chad to see what will transpire. The plan starts to materialize as the lab rat for this scheme is a naive, shy secretary named Christine (Stacy Edwards) who works at the satellite office who is also deaf. The whole film, Chad and Howard take turns charming Christine, while that's progressing, their scheme starts to get out of control and takes its turns in expected turn of events. The manipulative schemes the men have on poor Christine are very deceitful that it's hard to watch at times. In the case of Chad, the plot is an attempt to emerge victorious as a ploy to further express his disdain to the female gender. Howard feels this scheme is unlawful, it more like to be aware of what's inside looking out instead of vice-versa. The audience and even Hoawrd himself know this plot will not work out. In most movies and T.V. shows they never do. But it's still intriguing in how this plan will come crashing down on them. And we hope that there might be a small fragment of humanity between Chad and Howard. Sure the outcome is predictable, but it's still fun to watch how it will backfire. The reason for dark comedy isn't the jokes or the action by the leading stars, but the laughter rests in the vicinity of what lengths people will go to to express how hateful we as human race truly are. The character-driven film scores high points in terms of depth. In addition to that it makes us reconsider our actions by what we say and do I'm glad that Mr. LaBute ended the film with a moral lesson or a perfectly wrapped happy ending. In the end in this case, the antagonist comes out the winner. And in the real world, bad people usually end up victorious in many situations. Granted Chad is a handsome individual and can wow the ladies with his charm quite easily. But at the same time time he's hypocritical, obnoxious and quite the condescending person who looks a nice person you want to punch in the mouth with. But he is still easy to identify with. There are a lot of Chad's out there And yet you feel sick to your stomach because you understand the psyche of this character so in the end I'm the jerk that has the egg on his face. The whole Chad, Howard and Christine love factor has some noteworthy things of interest here. You have two to put it loosely gentlemen of contrasting backgrounds. You have Chad, the handsome, suave ladies man, and then you have Howard who comes across as socially awkward who like most people of his kind in society are the one's who never come out on top (me included). And it's obvious Christine chooses the suave one over the awkward one. Matt Malloy was excellent portraying Howard. At fist he come across as an introverted individual. However, in the pivotal scenes in the end, it's a breath of fresh air when he lashes out when his buttons are pushed. Once the dust settles, we find these two jerks madly in love with Christine being the unlucky victim due to her being deaf. Both fall victim to the metaphoric love potion. Chad is at a loss of words to admit he loves her while Howard feels short that lost in a situation where he should have won. But in spite of the shortcomings within the characters, it is a wonderful character-driven story that might be hard to swallow in some situations.

    Neil Labute's "In The Company of Men" stars Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy as Chad and Howard, a pair of mid-level corporate executives sent to a boring regional branch for six weeks on a short term project. Frustrated, recently burnt by women, stuck in a career rut and high on corporate testosterone, the duo hatch a plan. "Let's hurt somebody," alpha-male Chad says. Pretty soon they're cooking up a Machiavellian scheme to locate an insecure woman, date her simultaneously, and dump her in the most vicious way possible. The woman they set their sights on is handicapped co-worker Christine. Christine has a speech impediment, but what she says doesn't matter to Chad anyway. Denied a voice, Chad handles her like an object to be acquired, traded, owned and discarded. Labute is heavily influenced by David Mamet. Most of the film finds Chad spewing corporate maxims, strutting about like a Master of the Universe and forcing co-workers to grovel at his feet. Eventually its revealed that Chad's scheming extends even to his "friend" Howard. He's your classic Extreme Sociopath, charming but endlessly manipulative. Everyone's his puppet. And as with Mamet's "workplace flicks", Chad's less a character than an extreme manifestation of a corporate logic whose drive for profit, ownership and expansion slowly infects how everyone around him thinks, acts and feels. Eventually Chad becomes both a norm and standard to aspire to. He's the new hypermasculinist ideal, for whom humiliation, domination, degradation, exploitation and suffering conflate with success. It's not only that aggressive competition in business affects masculinity, romance and sexual behaviour, but that corporate logic magnifies power, the ego and sanctions what is essentially various forms of rape. This stance is the opposite of how contemporary ideology is (mis)perceived, in which "business" is seen to be "neutral" and "mutually beneficial". Chad's a character who's popped up in many films and stories. More interesting is Howard, a fairly meek guy who is corrupted and made to do things even more horrible than Chad. The real world is made up of Howards. Chad's the anomaly, existing always more as spirit or underlying drive. La Bute penned "The Shape of Things" as an attempt to reverse the gender roles of "Company". Arguably his best film, it's also part of a tight trilogy by Labute about people's perceptions of physicality ("Fat Pig", "Reasons to be Pretty", "Shape of Things"). Massive spoilers ahead. "The Shape of Things" initially unfolds like a conventional romantic comedy. We're introduced to a dishevelled English Literature student called Adam, played by the always likable Paul Rudd, and an attractive art student called Evelyn (Rachel Weisz). The film then becomes a modern version of Adam's seduction by Eve. Eve ensnares Adam, manipulates him into becoming "fit", "attractive" and "healthy", and then reveals that she has never had romantic feelings toward him; she was merely using Adam as a sort of living art installation, a clay puppet, deceptively sculpting and moulding his mind and body. When Eve reveals her scheme to Adam Â– she invites him to an art installation in which he is quite literally presented as an exhibited object, her gaze now likened to the masculinist gaze of "In The Company of Men" - he's dumbfounded. Eve's tricked him into getting cosmetic surgery and altering his personality and physique. She's reconstructed him. Treated him as a chunk of malleable flesh. Unlike "Company", we're then invited to work our way through the messy ethical minefield of the victimiser's actions. For while Chad deservedly gets no sympathy in "Company", the relationship in "Things" is much harder to work out. Is Adam now a better person? Was Eve's love, no matter how virtual, beneficial to Adam? Was it ever real? How much authority should be given, or do we give, to artists? How much ethical responsibility do they hold or exercise? How do power relationships within romantic couples overlap with the power we grant artists? Don't Eve's actions echo the sexism of "Compny"? What is acceptable artistic material? Do the means, in art, justify the ends? At what point does creation become manipulation, is manipulation ever justified and at what point does creation destroy (see "Vertigo")? Is Adam now a beautiful work of "art" despite Eve's actions? How do Eve's actions differ from other vampiric artists, who take from and/or abuse outside sources? What does the film say about romance and the lover's desire to alter their partner? Art may be made by monsters, but what about the audience who enjoys? And on and on it goes. The film features a shot of the sentence "There is no morality in art". The quote's by Chinese novelist Han Suiyin, and is stencilled over Eve's art gallery. Throughout the film Eve articulates a similarly postmodern stance: "it's all subjective", she says, "moralists have no place in an art gallery". The firm itself is structured, we think, as an artist's apologia. Its first scene portrays Eve as an iconoclast who thrice breaks the rules, stepping over a rope at a museum, taking an illegal photograph of a sculpture and painting a penis onto a statue which has been censored by uptight museum curators. "You stepped over the line, Miss," curator Adam prophetically says when he firsts meets her. But as Eve makes clear, there should be no lines. We agree with her for much of the film. Afterall, hasn't she liberated Adam? By the film's end, however, we're asked to reconsider Eve's stance. Labute himself reconfigures Han Suiyin's quote. It's not that "there is no morality in art", in the sense that morality should not apply to art, but more literally, that "there is now, no longer, morality in art". Artists have no ethical compass, social feeling or attachment toward world, community or fellowman. Such art doesn't only exist in a vacuum, but is inherently selfish and nihilistic. You know, like Chad. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Almost every line and every scene in this tight, aggressive film is purposeful. Aaron Eckhart's performance as Chad is relaxed, controlled, and indifferently sadistic without being brutal. Matt Malloy's performance as Howard is absolutely necessary to the success of the film. The audience is never supposed to respect Howard, and Malloy commits unflinchingly to the role. Howard, in the end, discovers that he has been purposelessly led by his own weakness to want vindication for his ego--instead, he becomes a pathetic imitation of a romantic hero for a moral purpose he pretended to ignore. Some of the script suffers from believability. The beginning of the film, when Howard is slapped for asking a woman the time, is pretty unreasonable. If the film is (even an implicit) argument that women provoke men to be cruel, it proceeds from a false premise. The story boils down to the simple logic that Chad can manipulate and destroy Howard because Howard believes he's able to manipulate and destroy someone else. I envision Chad as a kind of false Satan--a man who pretends to be against God and morality solely for the purpose of seducing and destroying the lives of characters who believe in him. "How does it feel to really hurt someone?"

    In the Company of Men is a movie that makes one consider his or her actions after watching. The film puts the human conscience to the test by illustrating an exaggerated example of how heartless people can be at times. The film centered around three main characters. Aaron Eckhart played Chad, the arrogant, back-stabbing and ruthless bad guy. Christine, played by Stacy Edwards, was the first of Chad's "victims" of cruelty. Matt Malloy played Howard, a man who thought Chad was his friend. In early portions of the film, the theme appears to be revenge upon women by scorned men. However, as the plot thickens, the true theme of the film reveals itself. It turns out that Chad is planning to hurt anyone he can. The real theme of the film is that some people care about only themselves. Chad is a classic case of one of those people. Throughout the film, he carefully executes a plan to hurt Christine, a deaf woman who has not dated in a long time, due to her handicap. He uses Howard to help in the act of hurting Christine. Chad eventually accomplishes his main goal. However, Howard develops feelings for Christine and tells her that he and Chad had set out to hurt her from the beginning. He also tells her that he has fallen in love with her, although she never gives him a chance to prove that. As a result, Howard ends up being hurt as well. As the plan to hurt Christine comes to fruition, other subplots become evident. Smaller examples of the theme come to light. Chad organizes a series of events that lead to Howard being demoted from his position in the company he and Chad work for. It was no coincidence that Chad eventually was promoted to Howard's position. As the viewer watches Chad's plans unfold, certain elements of film production can be detected as enhancers of the theme. For example, the music between scenes is bold and loud. It gives one the impression that something ominous is going to happen. The music seems to create an element of building tension. One anticipates a huge event of a bad nature. The camera angles chosen for many of the scenes make Chad seem very powerful and evil. The scenes that use upward views of Chad and Howard together are particularly persuasive toward creating this impression. The various angles used in the date scenes between Chad and Christine further emphasize Chad's lack of conscience. The theme of this film, and the execution of the theme, is very similar to that found in The Usual Suspects. Both films focus on a character that is deceiving people purposely. They are also similar, in that the "villain" is not found out by the other characters until the end of the movie. The only difference is that Chad is not so eager to get away clean with his acts. He seems to be proud of his actions, and willingly tells Howard what he has done. This film's theme is one that makes some consider their actions, while it makes others strive to achieve such power. The effect it has on you should say something about the kind of person you are. It made me consider how awful it feels to be hurt. Those involved in making this film have put together a powerful piece that, while lacking in action, forces people to examine themselves and others.

    Misogynist Film of the Moment: In the Company of Men 3 11 2009 I just watched one of the worst movies ever. I share my opinion only because I want you to watch it as well and see if you relate or if you are repulsed. Some of you might've seen it before. The title sounded familiar and its for that reason that I let the movie take my evening away from me. There was an award given to the filmmaker. It was released in 1997. I usually don't blast movies because they are supposed to leave you in a mood. The director and writer don't do a good job of portraying the comedy to this dark comedy though, and as a result it comes off as a serious film, and leaves a bad taste in the viewers mouth. Do not let your girlfriends watch this movie. It will only add to the man hate already happening. This is fuel to the fire. That said, if you do watch it, try to figure out which of the two guys you are more like, Chad or Howard, and get back at me. I might have to start a new column where I share these discoveries with you. This is an insult to misogynists everywhere. Not approved. In The Company Of Men ----Ryan Mega sexdrugsmoney.com

    Chad is a perfect example of a sociopath/psychopath, someone who is amoral, takes risks in his personal and work life, is utterly charming when he is working on someone, but cold and and cruel when he no longer needs them. I thought this film was a brilliant portrayal of the psychopath and how he draws in his victims. Lying is second nature to him, he takes everything in his stride because he has no emotional response to anything that transpires. Chad is in control and it is almost hypnotic to see him manipulate those around him. There was another thread running through the story, the office politics, and Howard appeared to have missed what was really happening - just like a real life victim, he would not have realised just how evil Chad is. Definitely one for my collection of films about psychos.

    I remember seeing In the Company of Men a very long time agoÂ…not sure exactly when, but it was when I began noticing independent films verses big budgeted all-name films. And I loved it. It was a refreshing change from explosions every few minutes. Unfortunately, times have changed. Yeah, I still like the film Â– I am a sucker for "super-human" characters, and Chad (Eckhart) certainly is. But, now my eyes opened, recently, to pacing and movies that overstay their welcomes. Don't give up on this movie, however. It's a somewhat original idea with excellent acting from Eckhart as an, excuse my English, asshole whose main purpose is to see people suffer for mere amusement. Here we have two "gentlemen," Howard (Malloy) and Chad who work together Â– one being the boss, though they graduated close to each other, and are sent for six weeks to an undisclosed city to set up their sales business. In a little down time Â– as few and far between it is, Howard admits to his buddy that he's been recently dumped by his girlfriend. Chad retorts with his story of love-lost with his girlfriend and then proposes the idea of the movie: revenge against women. Chad wants to find that special nobody, and have both him and Howard date her, romance her, make her feel like she's on top of the world and then simply pull the rug out and laugh as she falls. Sounds cruel? Well, yeahÂ…there's no other way to describe it. However, it gets worse; the one they pick, Christine (Edwards) is deaf. They do what they set out to. But, unfortunately for the movie's sake: they make it painfully obvious that one will fall (for her,) one will rise and the end result is what you expect. What holds the movie together and makes it worth a viewing is Eckhart as Chad. He's evil. He's borderline Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct) but he's somewhat more despicable than Stone, because he makes this all the more real. Also, they both smoke like a chimneyÂ…not that it's relevant Â– it's just probably thrown in as "you simply can't trust a smoker" I'm assuming. In addition, the end revolutions, when both Chad Â– who explains his motivations, and Howard who, well, shouts his, also make it worthy of a complete viewing. And finally: Edwards who plays Christine, is really NOT deaf in real life, so her acting and "speech" is truly impressive. Listen to the audio commentary. This is real acting. It's not fast paced and it's based on the stereotypical movie "lie" approach that always leads to the clich&eacute; revolutionary scene, but it's interesting as a "yeah, this could really happen" story and the actual climax is quite fulfilling. Eckhart is so good in this role; you almost root for him, despite his evil intentions. The writing is good enough to see he did place his pieces (people) in the exact locations he wanted them and that's not pulled off by most actors. I do love super-human characters that use people as pawns. Stone did it brilliantly in Basic Instinct and Eckhart proved he could almost (give it about 80%) match her. Only, some of his scenes Â– such as, show me your balls Â– were a little off-kilter. As was his character.

    Engrossing and fascinating, if uncompromisingly nasty, film from provocateur Neil LaBute. Two businessmen, one alpha male, the other paunchy wimp, play with the emotions of a deaf coworker as a way to vent their own frustrations about work, sex -- and just about everything else about being human. The resulting film is angry and predictably uncomfortable to watch, but the compelling writing and performances are enough to keep you engaged. This was the first film to introduce me to the considerable talents of Aaron Eckhart, a chronically underrated actor. Grade: A-

    Early in the movie the premise of the story line is made clear. Two Yuppie businessmen away on a project in a branch office are discussing their relationships with women. They tell each other how badly they have treated them and how downtrodden they feel. This leads one of them to come up with a plan, which he convinces the other fellow to join in with him. They will find unsuspecting, susceptible young woman during the six weeks that are away. They will each wine, dine and romance her simultaneously and then both will dump her and leave town. As one of them puts it, in the future no matter how badly they are treated by girlfriends, their wives or even their bosses, they will look back and know that nobody treated them as badly as they were going to treat this women. Nice guys? Now what does this movie show us? What insight into the human mind or into the mind of some subtype of men can we glean? Well, they carry out the plan albeit with some complications. When she realizes what was done to her, the young woman says to one of the men, "Why did you do this?" He answers, "Because I could?" Does that line sound familiar? Although the line became famous a few years after this movie was made Bill Clinton is the person who immortalized those words in response to a question from Dan Rather in a 60 Minute TV interview as to why he had his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton replied, "I think I did something for the worst possible reason-just because I could. I think that's the most, just about the most morally indefensible reason that anybody could have for doing anything. When you do something just because you couldÂ… I've thought about it a lot. And there are lots of more sophisticated explanations, more complicated psychological explanations. But none of them are an excuse." Those psychological reasons may vary from person to person and there were two male characters in the movie and of course Clinton is a character himself. In some there is a core of self-centeredness or narcissism, some of which may make you a good leader or a boss but too much of it will be a disaster. Then in some individuals there is a great insecurity, which can include jealousy and aggression. We saw a mixture of these in our characters in the movie. Director Neil LaBute made the six week time span move quickly and actors Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy were excellent. Although the performance of Stacy Edwards was also top notch, there was controversy in some circles who thought that a real deaf actress should have played the part. We should have mentioned that the susceptible attractive young women who was to be dumped had lost her hearing at age 8 and had a speech impairment. Some may find this movie very thought provoking. Hopefully it won't be too close to home.

    Here we have corporate culture at its worst in the 90s; two men, a decade out of college, going city to city and making their money by giving presentations and telling others what to do. It's a high-pressure job with what appears to be small reward. Both Chad and Howard are slowly becoming fed up as they see younger men rise quicker and with less work ethic; they see their wives and girlfriends leave them without warning, breaking their hearts as their souls are destroyed in the workplace. It has become too much for Chad and he is looking for revenge. What better way to do so than at the demise of a girl, the fairer sex in which he says is composed of women "all the same, meat and gristle and hatred just simmering"? What if they could lead on some poor soul who has reached a point in her life where the prospect of a relationship or a future full of love is unattainable and than destroy her for sport to watch the reaction? Hell, they'll always be able to tell each other afterwards, "They never got me the way we got her". The writing is cynical and witty; this is one of the blackest comedies you will ever view. I literally felt bad laughing at times, but it is constructed so smartly, you just can't help yourself. Howard is a wormy romantic who knows Chad, the epitome of alpha male, from college and has stayed close through the years. He would never partake in a game such as this if not for the tale of his stronger buddy being cleaned out by his girl, even having the frame around his American Gigolo poster taken from him. If the sort of heartbreak Howard feels can happen to his friend too, well than maybe the female race deserves to be taught a lesson; unfortunately for temp Christine, that exercise will be brought upon her in full. She is the perfect fodder for their six week revenge plan, not only is she attractive, but she is deaf. Handicapped to the point where she wears headphones to appear distracted when unable to hear someone walk by, she is so far removed from the dating scene that the advances of two successful men in the office may just be too strong for her to pass up. Both men work together to show her so much affection that she will have to fall for at least one. Love, however, wasn't anticipated to play a role in the proceedings. As the weeks advance, the dates become more intimate, the bonds stronger. Sitting and watching the advancement starts to make it tough to discern true motivations. Are Chad and Howard really falling for her or are they that good at pretending in order to make the breakup as devastating as possible? Howard may not be getting as close physically to the girl, but his actions express a longing and need to be with her. Chad, on the other hand, working his magic and getting her in bed, has acquired the phrase he's been working towards, having her tell him she loves him. He responds in kind, but is it real? We will have to wait and see in week six whether the game has gone too far or whether it has gone just as planned. That statement may seem cruel, because the fact the ruse began at all means it went too farÂ—they are playing with an innocent's emotions and heart for sportÂ—but in the context of the film, you do start to buy into it and want to see what kind of fallout will result. LaBute does come from the stage and it shows here in his first film as most scenes are constructed from long takes and static setups. One moment on the rooftop has Chad almost flub a line, but they keep going, either to keep a sense of realism or save money on reshooting the exchange. Definitely shot on the cheap, it becomes the job of the actors to perform at the highest level, and they do not disappoint. Stacy Edwards is amazing as Christine, both in her portrayal of a deaf woman and in the emotional turmoil she must go through from start to finish. Also remember too, see is deceiving them by going out with both at the same time, selfishly keeping her own happiness above them knowing the truth. But it is Matt Malloy and Aaron Eckhart, as Howard and Chad respectively, that really carry the film. Malloy is a ball of nerves and insecurities, yet when he needs to be, either lying to the girl or venting to his friend, can compose himself to a man of power and force. Needing incentive to be confident, it is in him, but the moments where his insecurities rear their head shine above all else; never able to control the situation, he slowly devolves into a version of Chad. Chad, conversely, doesn't have a weak bone to his name. He says at the end that he can sell anyone, and it is true. The lines he utters are pure gold and I can see why it was hard for him to get work early in his career. Eckhart played a prick so well, no one wanted the controversy surrounding this role to take anything away from the new work. He is so conniving, so manipulative, yet with a smile that can charm us all. This film exists due to his performance and the revelations at the conclusion only cement him as one of the best screen villains ever. I'd love to see this story on stage, because The Shape of Things blew away its brilliant screen counterpart when I saw a college production, and I can only imagine watching this acted out in front of me would do the same if not more.
