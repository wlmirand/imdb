    It's 1985, Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) is a wedding singer from New Jersey who dreams of being a songwriter. His job doesn't pay well, but he's happy because he's good at what he does, and because he truly believes in love. Robbie's getting married to his high school sweetheart, Linda,(Angela Featherstone)and he's convinced that Linda is the girl for him While singing at the reception hall, Robbie meets a new waitress named Julia, (Drew Barrymore) she's a sweet girl who's engaged to a self-absorbed junk bond trader named Glenn Guglia (Matthew Glave) Glen drives a DeLorean and thinks he looks like Don Johnson. Just as Robbie is about to get married, Linda stands him up at the altar and breaks his heart. Brokenhearted, he stays in his sister's basement listening to depressing music and not shaving. When he goes back to work as a wedding singer, he's as sullen and depressed as ever. He sings "Love Stinks" at his first wedding after breaking up with Linda, and promptly gets punched by the groom's father. Just as things are going badly for Robbie, things start to go well for Julia, Glenn agrees to marry Julia, but wants nothing to do with planning the details of the wedding, so Julia asks Robbie to help him plan the wedding, and along the way, Robbie falls in love with her, but keeps those feelings to himself. Later, Robbie goes on a double-date with Julia's cousin, Holly (Christine Taylor) Julia and Glenn. When they're alone Glenn admits to Robbie that he's already cheated on Julia and plans to continue. Does Robbie tell Julia about Glenn's womanizing? Does he admit his own feelings about Julia to Julia? Does Julia marry Glenn, despite having feelings for Robbie? An Adam Sandler movie that's a classic? Believe it, I love this movie, because no movie encapsulates the mood of 1980's America like the Wedding Singer, the music, the clothes, the big hair, even the TV shows. It really is a sweet love story about a nice guy who believes in love, and gets his heart broken, trying to find love again. Is it predictable? Sure it is, but every romantic comedy is predictable. Half the fun of a good romantic comedy is the journey, and this is one funny ride. Adam Sandler's never made a movie before or since, that's made use of both his musical and comedic talents the way this one did. He sings some songs that he wrote, one funny, one sweet, and it really makes the part of a struggling singer more believable when the audience hears Sandler sing. Drew Barrymore's never been more appealing, sweet, vulnerable, her face filled with joy and angst at the same time. She was undeniably cute in this film, and her chemistry with Sandler was undeniable too, they tried to re-kindle that chemistry in the awful "50 First Dates" but it didn't work, proving that chemistry is a tricky thing and not just in science class. This is a movie with some standout cameos as well. Steve Buscemi is very funny as the bitter brother of one of the grooms. Jon Lovitz is hilarious as Jimmie Moore, a smarmy wedding singer who flirts with Barrymore as he sings "Ladies Night." 80's punk rocker Billy Idol has a cameo for authenticity. The writing is excellent, Tim Herlihy wrote this movie, and he wrote three of Sandler's funnier movies, this one, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy. The Wedding Singer was the best of the three. The length of the film is perfect, a little over 90 minutes, any longer for a comedy, and it starts to drag. Finally, if you want to know what the music was like in 1980's America watch this movie, it has a slice of everything, from Boy George, to the Smiths, to Huey Lewis. The songs definitely set the mood for the movie, a fun love letter to the 1980's. For more reviews to sing about, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpreess.com

    I marvel at the fact that this movie has such a low average score! But here is a top-scoring review to throw into the mix. The Wedding Singer is a great tribute to the awkward, at-times-eye-straining 80's, complete with a brilliant soundtrack and awesome wardrobe. I love the story, and Adam Sandler's character. I also think Drew Barrymore's character Julia is just so cute. I only recently realised that "George" is played by Patricia Arquette's sister Alexis, but I guess that's just another reason to love the character - the Arquettes are fabulous! In short, I believe this movie is made of pure genius. And not just because Billy Idol's in it.

    Robbie is stood up at the altar by Linda, who decides that the prospect of marrying a guy who sings at wedding receptions doesn't equal the attraction she felt when he was lead singer in a rock band. Robbie finds consolation in his friendship with Julia, a waitress at the wedding receptions and bar mitzvahs where he performs. Julia asks Robbie to help her plan her upcoming wedding to Glenn, who isn't interested in the details of the ceremony. Robbie learns that Glenn also isn't totally interested in Julia and is marrying her because she "deserves it" after sticking with him for years and because he knows she's not marrying him for his money, since she dated him back before he started pulling down the big bucks... It's not your typical Sandler movie. There are no where near as many sight gags and rants as you get in his other movies. This is 'The Ladies' Adam Sandler, as you have also seen in '50 first dates' and 'Big Daddy'. It's ultimately a chick flick with a slight Sandler Sheen. All of his regulars are here, but they play it more straighter than usual. But it's a god film. The chemistry between the two leads is fantastic, and they should make more movies together. If you, like myself, love the eighties, then this is the pinnacle tribute to the eighties. Big Hair, Big egos, and Billy Idol. A movie that will brighten your day up.

    The rare instance of a romantic comedy that stands tall and succeeds despite the trappings of its clich&eacute;-ridden genre. This by-the-numbers Adam Sandler / Drew Barrymore vehicle is rescued from mediocrity by a ridiculously good soundtrack, an unexpectedly sweet vat of chemistry between the two leads and one big, fat, steaming gob of '80s nostalgia. Sandler and Barrymore don't exactly light the screen on fire with their acting chops - in fact, most of their lines are so stiff and hammy, I'm surprised they made the cut - but there's a strange, genuine warmth that resonates between them, and the film uses those sparks to fuel a bonfire. The plot isn't as edgy and obtuse as Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, but that ultimately results in a smoother, more digestible picture that's still not without a few of Sandler's signature left-field moments. Heartfelt and funny, it's also thin enough to need the not-too-distant throwback setting as a crutch.

    This movie is excellent for what kind of movie it is. It is a feel good movie that has GREAT comedy and a romantic vibe throughout. Both Drew Barrymore and Sandler really pull together nicely. Drew's acting truly shines and puts the emotions of young love at an all time high. The Movie takes you through many mishaps and misconceptions of what can happen when trying to bring another person to love you and hope that the other loves you as well. The comedy is through the roof funny, and my wife and I have had many great quotes for our own marriage. This movie has made our lives better, and brought some great smiles and laughs to our relationship through out our 12 years of marriage.

    "The Wedding Singer" is a 1998 film starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. Frank Coraci directs this romantic comedy about a wedding singer (Sandler) struggling to find true love in a seemingly cruel world. From what I've heard about this film, it's one of Sandler's best movies. IGN actually called it his best, so needless to say I wanted to see it. Is it his best movie? I don't think so, but it's not bad. I found most of this movie to be quite entertaining. The best part of this movie is the fact that if features an almost unbearably charming soundtrack featuring a plethora of 80s classics. I love the 80s, I honestly think they were one of the best decades in American History. It was a time that featured a cultural renaissance, a solid economy, and an overall unique feel and I was glad to see that this movie embraced that period so openly. Adam Sandler is also one of the film's strongest points. I honestly did not think that he could play any other part than the lovable fool ("Waterboy") or the ill-tempered everyman ("Billy Madison"), but he can. Not saying that those parts are bad, but it's refreshing to see a change of pace every once and a while, and Sandler's performance in this film is one. Some of the jokes are filled with a little too much brown and they seem dated in a few parts, but the film's comedy is generally funny. The script is pretty predictable, but as I said it's too charming to rip apart. Anyway I found that, in the end, "The Wedding Singer" was a genuinely entertaining movie that ranks among one of Adam Sandler's best movies.

    I just saw this after having watched it once long ago, probably back in the VHS days, late nineties. I think it's still incredibly charming and funny today (in 2011). I rarely laugh out in the movies, especially alone, but I did here. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are so likable in their respective lead roles. Weirdly, I think it's because they're shown to be really sweet and compassionate and from them it seems genuine. There's such a good chemistry between those 2 and you can't help, but root for them to somehow get together. Of course, several of the funny bits come from the usual Sandler's losing his temper bits. Lots of humour comes from contrasts or switching between moods (ex.: from nice or sad to angry and back again), especially the time Sandler sings his latest composition. You shouldn't laugh, because the lyrics are so grim, but because of his performance, you can't help yourself. Consider also how hilarious it is when he sings a famous happy song, but does it so desperately. You have an amazing soundtrack full of 80s songs that are thematically right on the spot and often quite amusing (especially that famous Boy George song). I was pleased at how generally good Sandler was with the frequent singing despite his few distinctive funny voice inclinations. From the credits, it's supposed to be him and it sure looks like he's really singing instead of lip-syncing. Lots of enjoyment also comes from seeing the (now) outrageous fashions and coiffures of the 80s, as well as the inappropriate things kids and grandmas will say and do. It's obvious people who were teens or adults in the 80s will get the most of the many references, but I do think younger people will also enjoy this very much for other reasons. The Wedding Singer, despite being a romantic comedy, is not that predictable or conventional if you consider, amongst other things, how both main characters start off in a serious relationship headed for impending marriage. I even found it quite touching a few times, almost shedding a tear near the end. Paraphrasing somewhat the start of the movie, some of us, like me, will likely never ever find true love, but it's nice to keep the illusion alive by watching such a sweet-natured and genuinely funny romantic comedy. The 80s setting is a bonus, but it's the heart and laughs that make it shine. It's also something I could easily see myself watching every few years with equal pleasure. Rating: 9 out of 10 (excellent)

    The Wedding Singer is very good comedy with a blend of romantic elements. I never expected the movie to be as good as it is because of exactly that. However, this was the only Adam Sandler movie I haven't seen at this point so I gave it a try. I was very impressed. This is about a guy named Robbie Hart who is a successful wedding singer. Things turn for the worst when his wife leaves him at his own wedding. He becomes a depressed person and is on the verge of losing his job. Then he becomes best friends with a waitress. Will they fall in love? Even though Sandler is his usual typical self, he shows a heart-warming side of him. He shows some dramatic acting skills for the first time. Drew Barrymore is just fantastic as the waitress. The rest of the supporting actors were great as well. Overall, this is a funny, heart-warming film for all. This may be Adam's best movie. I rate this film 9/10.

    OK I have seen this before on TV and I thought it was funny. The movie features 50 First Date's actors Drew Barromore and Adam Sandler and tells the story of a washed singer who performs at weddings. He falls for a young waitress(Barrowmore)who is engaged to a man who doesn't really love her Robbie(sandler)himself was also suppose to marry too but his fianc&eacute; left him at the alter. Every time I watch this film I could see a similarity of Music & Lyrics which also told the story of a washed pop star who falls for a girl(Barromore again) and both actors sing(Grant & Sandler). I know I am only suppose to review one film but I could see a lot of similarities. If you like Adam Sandler and Rom Com's where you've got a guy fallen for a girl who is already taken then check it out.

    The film is a little too short, but other than that it is a funny, entertaining and charming romantic comedy. I don't care for Adam Sandler that much, as there have been movies where I have found him irritating, but here he gives one of his more likable performances because he is pitch-perfect here. Drew Barrymore is an actress I like, I think she is pretty and I think she can act(I loved her in Ever After), and she plays a truly charming romantic interest. Sandler and Barrymore's chemistry really works here, and they are supported wonderfully by some great supporting actors, Steve Buschemi being the funniest. The screenplay is funny and touching, the production values are a delight, the direction is secure and of course the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful. Overall, just a nice and entertaining feel-good film. 8/10 Bethany Cox

Lots of enjoyment also comes from seeing the (now) outrageous fashions and coiffures of the 80s, as well as the inappropriate things kids and grandmas will say and do. It's obvious people who were teens or adults in the 80s will get the most of the many references, but I do think younger people will also enjoy this very much for other reasons. The Wedding Singer, despite being a romantic comedy, is not that predictable or conventional if you consider, amongst other things, how both main characters start off in a serious relationship headed for impending marriage. I even found it quite touching a few times, almost shedding a tear near the end. Paraphrasing somewhat the start of the movie, some of us, like me, will likely never ever find true love, but it's nice to keep the illusion alive by watching such a sweet-natured and genuinely funny romantic comedy. The 80s setting is a bonus, but it's the heart and laughs that make it shine. It's also something I could easily see myself watching every few years with equal pleasure. Rating: 9 out of 10 (excellent)

    The Wedding Singer is very good comedy with a blend of romantic elements. I never expected the movie to be as good as it is because of exactly that. However, this was the only Adam Sandler movie I haven't seen at this point so I gave it a try. I was very impressed. This is about a guy named Robbie Hart who is a successful wedding singer. Things turn for the worst when his wife leaves him at his own wedding. He becomes a depressed person and is on the verge of losing his job. Then he becomes best friends with a waitress. Will they fall in love? Even though Sandler is his usual typical self, he shows a heart-warming side of him. He shows some dramatic acting skills for the first time. Drew Barrymore is just fantastic as the waitress. The rest of the supporting actors were great as well. Overall, this is a funny, heart-warming film for all. This may be Adam's best movie. I rate this film 9/10.

    OK I have seen this before on TV and I thought it was funny. The movie features 50 First Date's actors Drew Barromore and Adam Sandler and tells the story of a washed singer who performs at weddings. He falls for a young waitress(Barrowmore)who is engaged to a man who doesn't really love her Robbie(sandler)himself was also suppose to marry too but his fianc&eacute; left him at the alter. Every time I watch this film I could see a similarity of Music & Lyrics which also told the story of a washed pop star who falls for a girl(Barromore again) and both actors sing(Grant & Sandler). I know I am only suppose to review one film but I could see a lot of similarities. If you like Adam Sandler and Rom Com's where you've got a guy fallen for a girl who is already taken then check it out.

    The film is a little too short, but other than that it is a funny, entertaining and charming romantic comedy. I don't care for Adam Sandler that much, as there have been movies where I have found him irritating, but here he gives one of his more likable performances because he is pitch-perfect here. Drew Barrymore is an actress I like, I think she is pretty and I think she can act(I loved her in Ever After), and she plays a truly charming romantic interest. Sandler and Barrymore's chemistry really works here, and they are supported wonderfully by some great supporting actors, Steve Buschemi being the funniest. The screenplay is funny and touching, the production values are a delight, the direction is secure and of course the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful. Overall, just a nice and entertaining feel-good film. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    It's 1985, Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) is a wedding singer from New Jersey who dreams of being a songwriter. His job doesn't pay well, but he's happy because he's good at what he does, and because he truly believes in love. Robbie's getting married to his high school sweetheart, Linda,(Angela Featherstone)and he's convinced that Linda is the girl for him While singing at the reception hall, Robbie meets a new waitress named Julia, (Drew Barrymore) she's a sweet girl who's engaged to a self-absorbed junk bond trader named Glenn Guglia (Matthew Glave) Glen drives a DeLorean and thinks he looks like Don Johnson. Just as Robbie is about to get married, Linda stands him up at the altar and breaks his heart. Brokenhearted, he stays in his sister's basement listening to depressing music and not shaving. When he goes back to work as a wedding singer, he's as sullen and depressed as ever. He sings "Love Stinks" at his first wedding after breaking up with Linda, and promptly gets punched by the groom's father. Just as things are going badly for Robbie, things start to go well for Julia, Glenn agrees to marry Julia, but wants nothing to do with planning the details of the wedding, so Julia asks Robbie to help him plan the wedding, and along the way, Robbie falls in love with her, but keeps those feelings to himself. Later, Robbie goes on a double-date with Julia's cousin, Holly (Christine Taylor) Julia and Glenn. When they're alone Glenn admits to Robbie that he's already cheated on Julia and plans to continue. Does Robbie tell Julia about Glenn's womanizing? Does he admit his own feelings about Julia to Julia? Does Julia marry Glenn, despite having feelings for Robbie? An Adam Sandler movie that's a classic? Believe it, I love this movie, because no movie encapsulates the mood of 1980's America like the Wedding Singer, the music, the clothes, the big hair, even the TV shows. It really is a sweet love story about a nice guy who believes in love, and gets his heart broken, trying to find love again. Is it predictable? Sure it is, but every romantic comedy is predictable. Half the fun of a good romantic comedy is the journey, and this is one funny ride. Adam Sandler's never made a movie before or since, that's made use of both his musical and comedic talents the way this one did. He sings some songs that he wrote, one funny, one sweet, and it really makes the part of a struggling singer more believable when the audience hears Sandler sing. Drew Barrymore's never been more appealing, sweet, vulnerable, her face filled with joy and angst at the same time. She was undeniably cute in this film, and her chemistry with Sandler was undeniable too, they tried to re-kindle that chemistry in the awful "50 First Dates" but it didn't work, proving that chemistry is a tricky thing and not just in science class. This is a movie with some standout cameos as well. Steve Buscemi is very funny as the bitter brother of one of the grooms. Jon Lovitz is hilarious as Jimmie Moore, a smarmy wedding singer who flirts with Barrymore as he sings "Ladies Night." 80's punk rocker Billy Idol has a cameo for authenticity. The writing is excellent, Tim Herlihy wrote this movie, and he wrote three of Sandler's funnier movies, this one, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy. The Wedding Singer was the best of the three. The length of the film is perfect, a little over 90 minutes, any longer for a comedy, and it starts to drag. Finally, if you want to know what the music was like in 1980's America watch this movie, it has a slice of everything, from Boy George, to the Smiths, to Huey Lewis. The songs definitely set the mood for the movie, a fun love letter to the 1980's. For more reviews to sing about, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpreess.com

    I marvel at the fact that this movie has such a low average score! But here is a top-scoring review to throw into the mix. The Wedding Singer is a great tribute to the awkward, at-times-eye-straining 80's, complete with a brilliant soundtrack and awesome wardrobe. I love the story, and Adam Sandler's character. I also think Drew Barrymore's character Julia is just so cute. I only recently realised that "George" is played by Patricia Arquette's sister Alexis, but I guess that's just another reason to love the character - the Arquettes are fabulous! In short, I believe this movie is made of pure genius. And not just because Billy Idol's in it.

    Robbie is stood up at the altar by Linda, who decides that the prospect of marrying a guy who sings at wedding receptions doesn't equal the attraction she felt when he was lead singer in a rock band. Robbie finds consolation in his friendship with Julia, a waitress at the wedding receptions and bar mitzvahs where he performs. Julia asks Robbie to help her plan her upcoming wedding to Glenn, who isn't interested in the details of the ceremony. Robbie learns that Glenn also isn't totally interested in Julia and is marrying her because she "deserves it" after sticking with him for years and because he knows she's not marrying him for his money, since she dated him back before he started pulling down the big bucks... It's not your typical Sandler movie. There are no where near as many sight gags and rants as you get in his other movies. This is 'The Ladies' Adam Sandler, as you have also seen in '50 first dates' and 'Big Daddy'. It's ultimately a chick flick with a slight Sandler Sheen. All of his regulars are here, but they play it more straighter than usual. But it's a god film. The chemistry between the two leads is fantastic, and they should make more movies together. If you, like myself, love the eighties, then this is the pinnacle tribute to the eighties. Big Hair, Big egos, and Billy Idol. A movie that will brighten your day up.

    The rare instance of a romantic comedy that stands tall and succeeds despite the trappings of its clich&eacute;-ridden genre. This by-the-numbers Adam Sandler / Drew Barrymore vehicle is rescued from mediocrity by a ridiculously good soundtrack, an unexpectedly sweet vat of chemistry between the two leads and one big, fat, steaming gob of '80s nostalgia. Sandler and Barrymore don't exactly light the screen on fire with their acting chops - in fact, most of their lines are so stiff and hammy, I'm surprised they made the cut - but there's a strange, genuine warmth that resonates between them, and the film uses those sparks to fuel a bonfire. The plot isn't as edgy and obtuse as Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, but that ultimately results in a smoother, more digestible picture that's still not without a few of Sandler's signature left-field moments. Heartfelt and funny, it's also thin enough to need the not-too-distant throwback setting as a crutch.

    This movie is excellent for what kind of movie it is. It is a feel good movie that has GREAT comedy and a romantic vibe throughout. Both Drew Barrymore and Sandler really pull together nicely. Drew's acting truly shines and puts the emotions of young love at an all time high. The Movie takes you through many mishaps and misconceptions of what can happen when trying to bring another person to love you and hope that the other loves you as well. The comedy is through the roof funny, and my wife and I have had many great quotes for our own marriage. This movie has made our lives better, and brought some great smiles and laughs to our relationship through out our 12 years of marriage.

    "The Wedding Singer" is a 1998 film starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. Frank Coraci directs this romantic comedy about a wedding singer (Sandler) struggling to find true love in a seemingly cruel world. From what I've heard about this film, it's one of Sandler's best movies. IGN actually called it his best, so needless to say I wanted to see it. Is it his best movie? I don't think so, but it's not bad. I found most of this movie to be quite entertaining. The best part of this movie is the fact that if features an almost unbearably charming soundtrack featuring a plethora of 80s classics. I love the 80s, I honestly think they were one of the best decades in American History. It was a time that featured a cultural renaissance, a solid economy, and an overall unique feel and I was glad to see that this movie embraced that period so openly. Adam Sandler is also one of the film's strongest points. I honestly did not think that he could play any other part than the lovable fool ("Waterboy") or the ill-tempered everyman ("Billy Madison"), but he can. Not saying that those parts are bad, but it's refreshing to see a change of pace every once and a while, and Sandler's performance in this film is one. Some of the jokes are filled with a little too much brown and they seem dated in a few parts, but the film's comedy is generally funny. The script is pretty predictable, but as I said it's too charming to rip apart. Anyway I found that, in the end, "The Wedding Singer" was a genuinely entertaining movie that ranks among one of Adam Sandler's best movies.

    I just saw this after having watched it once long ago, probably back in the VHS days, late nineties. I think it's still incredibly charming and funny today (in 2011). I rarely laugh out in the movies, especially alone, but I did here. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are so likable in their respective lead roles. Weirdly, I think it's because they're shown to be really sweet and compassionate and from them it seems genuine. There's such a good chemistry between those 2 and you can't help, but root for them to somehow get together. Of course, several of the funny bits come from the usual Sandler's losing his temper bits. Lots of humour comes from contrasts or switching between moods (ex.: from nice or sad to angry and back again), especially the time Sandler sings his latest composition. You shouldn't laugh, because the lyrics are so grim, but because of his performance, you can't help yourself. Consider also how hilarious it is when he sings a famous happy song, but does it so desperately. You have an amazing soundtrack full of 80s songs that are thematically right on the spot and often quite amusing (especially that famous Boy George song). I was pleased at how generally good Sandler was with the frequent singing despite his few distinctive funny voice inclinations. From the credits, it's supposed to be him and it sure looks like he's really singing instead of lip-syncing. Lots of enjoyment also comes from seeing the (now) outrageous fashions and coiffures of the 80s, as well as the inappropriate things kids and grandmas will say and do. It's obvious people who were teens or adults in the 80s will get the most of the many references, but I do think younger people will also enjoy this very much for other reasons. The Wedding Singer, despite being a romantic comedy, is not that predictable or conventional if you consider, amongst other things, how both main characters start off in a serious relationship headed for impending marriage. I even found it quite touching a few times, almost shedding a tear near the end. Paraphrasing somewhat the start of the movie, some of us, like me, will likely never ever find true love, but it's nice to keep the illusion alive by watching such a sweet-natured and genuinely funny romantic comedy. The 80s setting is a bonus, but it's the heart and laughs that make it shine. It's also something I could easily see myself watching every few years with equal pleasure.

I don't think so, but it's not bad. I found most of this movie to be quite entertaining. The best part of this movie is the fact that if features an almost unbearably charming soundtrack featuring a plethora of 80s classics. I love the 80s, I honestly think they were one of the best decades in American History. It was a time that featured a cultural renaissance, a solid economy, and an overall unique feel and I was glad to see that this movie embraced that period so openly. Adam Sandler is also one of the film's strongest points. I honestly did not think that he could play any other part than the lovable fool ("Waterboy") or the ill-tempered everyman ("Billy Madison"), but he can. Not saying that those parts are bad, but it's refreshing to see a change of pace every once and a while, and Sandler's performance in this film is one. Some of the jokes are filled with a little too much brown and they seem dated in a few parts, but the film's comedy is generally funny. The script is pretty predictable, but as I said it's too charming to rip apart. Anyway I found that, in the end, "The Wedding Singer" was a genuinely entertaining movie that ranks among one of Adam Sandler's best movies.

    I just saw this after having watched it once long ago, probably back in the VHS days, late nineties. I think it's still incredibly charming and funny today (in 2011). I rarely laugh out in the movies, especially alone, but I did here. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are so likable in their respective lead roles. Weirdly, I think it's because they're shown to be really sweet and compassionate and from them it seems genuine. There's such a good chemistry between those 2 and you can't help, but root for them to somehow get together. Of course, several of the funny bits come from the usual Sandler's losing his temper bits. Lots of humour comes from contrasts or switching between moods (ex.: from nice or sad to angry and back again), especially the time Sandler sings his latest composition. You shouldn't laugh, because the lyrics are so grim, but because of his performance, you can't help yourself. Consider also how hilarious it is when he sings a famous happy song, but does it so desperately. You have an amazing soundtrack full of 80s songs that are thematically right on the spot and often quite amusing (especially that famous Boy George song). I was pleased at how generally good Sandler was with the frequent singing despite his few distinctive funny voice inclinations. From the credits, it's supposed to be him and it sure looks like he's really singing instead of lip-syncing. Lots of enjoyment also comes from seeing the (now) outrageous fashions and coiffures of the 80s, as well as the inappropriate things kids and grandmas will say and do. It's obvious people who were teens or adults in the 80s will get the most of the many references, but I do think younger people will also enjoy this very much for other reasons. The Wedding Singer, despite being a romantic comedy, is not that predictable or conventional if you consider, amongst other things, how both main characters start off in a serious relationship headed for impending marriage. I even found it quite touching a few times, almost shedding a tear near the end. Paraphrasing somewhat the start of the movie, some of us, like me, will likely never ever find true love, but it's nice to keep the illusion alive by watching such a sweet-natured and genuinely funny romantic comedy. The 80s setting is a bonus, but it's the heart and laughs that make it shine. It's also something I could easily see myself watching every few years with equal pleasure. Rating: 9 out of 10 (excellent)

    The Wedding Singer is very good comedy with a blend of romantic elements. I never expected the movie to be as good as it is because of exactly that. However, this was the only Adam Sandler movie I haven't seen at this point so I gave it a try. I was very impressed. This is about a guy named Robbie Hart who is a successful wedding singer. Things turn for the worst when his wife leaves him at his own wedding. He becomes a depressed person and is on the verge of losing his job. Then he becomes best friends with a waitress. Will they fall in love? Even though Sandler is his usual typical self, he shows a heart-warming side of him. He shows some dramatic acting skills for the first time. Drew Barrymore is just fantastic as the waitress. The rest of the supporting actors were great as well. Overall, this is a funny, heart-warming film for all. This may be Adam's best movie. I rate this film 9/10.

    OK I have seen this before on TV and I thought it was funny. The movie features 50 First Date's actors Drew Barromore and Adam Sandler and tells the story of a washed singer who performs at weddings. He falls for a young waitress(Barrowmore)who is engaged to a man who doesn't really love her Robbie(sandler)himself was also suppose to marry too but his fianc&eacute; left him at the alter. Every time I watch this film I could see a similarity of Music & Lyrics which also told the story of a washed pop star who falls for a girl(Barromore again) and both actors sing(Grant & Sandler). I know I am only suppose to review one film but I could see a lot of similarities. If you like Adam Sandler and Rom Com's where you've got a guy fallen for a girl who is already taken then check it out.

    The film is a little too short, but other than that it is a funny, entertaining and charming romantic comedy. I don't care for Adam Sandler that much, as there have been movies where I have found him irritating, but here he gives one of his more likable performances because he is pitch-perfect here. Drew Barrymore is an actress I like, I think she is pretty and I think she can act(I loved her in Ever After), and she plays a truly charming romantic interest. Sandler and Barrymore's chemistry really works here, and they are supported wonderfully by some great supporting actors, Steve Buschemi being the funniest. The screenplay is funny and touching, the production values are a delight, the direction is secure and of course the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful. Overall, just a nice and entertaining feel-good film. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    It's 1985, Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) is a wedding singer from New Jersey who dreams of being a songwriter. His job doesn't pay well, but he's happy because he's good at what he does, and because he truly believes in love. Robbie's getting married to his high school sweetheart, Linda,(Angela Featherstone)and he's convinced that Linda is the girl for him While singing at the reception hall, Robbie meets a new waitress named Julia, (Drew Barrymore) she's a sweet girl who's engaged to a self-absorbed junk bond trader named Glenn Guglia (Matthew Glave) Glen drives a DeLorean and thinks he looks like Don Johnson. Just as Robbie is about to get married, Linda stands him up at the altar and breaks his heart. Brokenhearted, he stays in his sister's basement listening to depressing music and not shaving. When he goes back to work as a wedding singer, he's as sullen and depressed as ever. He sings "Love Stinks" at his first wedding after breaking up with Linda, and promptly gets punched by the groom's father. Just as things are going badly for Robbie, things start to go well for Julia, Glenn agrees to marry Julia, but wants nothing to do with planning the details of the wedding, so Julia asks Robbie to help him plan the wedding, and along the way, Robbie falls in love with her, but keeps those feelings to himself. Later, Robbie goes on a double-date with Julia's cousin, Holly (Christine Taylor) Julia and Glenn. When they're alone Glenn admits to Robbie that he's already cheated on Julia and plans to continue. Does Robbie tell Julia about Glenn's womanizing? Does he admit his own feelings about Julia to Julia? Does Julia marry Glenn, despite having feelings for Robbie? An Adam Sandler movie that's a classic? Believe it, I love this movie, because no movie encapsulates the mood of 1980's America like the Wedding Singer, the music, the clothes, the big hair, even the TV shows. It really is a sweet love story about a nice guy who believes in love, and gets his heart broken, trying to find love again. Is it predictable? Sure it is, but every romantic comedy is predictable. Half the fun of a good romantic comedy is the journey, and this is one funny ride. Adam Sandler's never made a movie before or since, that's made use of both his musical and comedic talents the way this one did. He sings some songs that he wrote, one funny, one sweet, and it really makes the part of a struggling singer more believable when the audience hears Sandler sing. Drew Barrymore's never been more appealing, sweet, vulnerable, her face filled with joy and angst at the same time. She was undeniably cute in this film, and her chemistry with Sandler was undeniable too, they tried to re-kindle that chemistry in the awful "50 First Dates" but it didn't work, proving that chemistry is a tricky thing and not just in science class. This is a movie with some standout cameos as well. Steve Buscemi is very funny as the bitter brother of one of the grooms. Jon Lovitz is hilarious as Jimmie Moore, a smarmy wedding singer who flirts with Barrymore as he sings "Ladies Night." 80's punk rocker Billy Idol has a cameo for authenticity. The writing is excellent, Tim Herlihy wrote this movie, and he wrote three of Sandler's funnier movies, this one, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy. The Wedding Singer was the best of the three. The length of the film is perfect, a little over 90 minutes, any longer for a comedy, and it starts to drag. Finally, if you want to know what the music was like in 1980's America watch this movie, it has a slice of everything, from Boy George, to the Smiths, to Huey Lewis. The songs definitely set the mood for the movie, a fun love letter to the 1980's. For more reviews to sing about, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpreess.com

The Wedding Singer is a great tribute to the awkward, at-times-eye-straining 80's, complete with a brilliant soundtrack and awesome wardrobe. I love the story, and Adam Sandler's character. I also think Drew Barrymore's character Julia is just so cute. I only recently realised that "George" is played by Patricia Arquette's sister Alexis, but I guess that's just another reason to love the character - the Arquettes are fabulous! In short, I believe this movie is made of pure genius. And not just because Billy Idol's in it.

    Robbie is stood up at the altar by Linda, who decides that the prospect of marrying a guy who sings at wedding receptions doesn't equal the attraction she felt when he was lead singer in a rock band. Robbie finds consolation in his friendship with Julia, a waitress at the wedding receptions and bar mitzvahs where he performs. Julia asks Robbie to help her plan her upcoming wedding to Glenn, who isn't interested in the details of the ceremony. Robbie learns that Glenn also isn't totally interested in Julia and is marrying her because she "deserves it" after sticking with him for years and because he knows she's not marrying him for his money, since she dated him back before he started pulling down the big bucks... It's not your typical Sandler movie. There are no where near as many sight gags and rants as you get in his other movies. This is 'The Ladies' Adam Sandler, as you have also seen in '50 first dates' and 'Big Daddy'. It's ultimately a chick flick with a slight Sandler Sheen. All of his regulars are here, but they play it more straighter than usual. But it's a god film. The chemistry between the two leads is fantastic, and they should make more movies together. If you, like myself, love the eighties, then this is the pinnacle tribute to the eighties. Big Hair, Big egos, and Billy Idol. A movie that will brighten your day up.

    The rare instance of a romantic comedy that stands tall and succeeds despite the trappings of its clich&eacute;-ridden genre. This by-the-numbers Adam Sandler / Drew Barrymore vehicle is rescued from mediocrity by a ridiculously good soundtrack, an unexpectedly sweet vat of chemistry between the two leads and one big, fat, steaming gob of '80s nostalgia. Sandler and Barrymore don't exactly light the screen on fire with their acting chops - in fact, most of their lines are so stiff and hammy, I'm surprised they made the cut - but there's a strange, genuine warmth that resonates between them, and the film uses those sparks to fuel a bonfire. The plot isn't as edgy and obtuse as Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, but that ultimately results in a smoother, more digestible picture that's still not without a few of Sandler's signature left-field moments. Heartfelt and funny, it's also thin enough to need the not-too-distant throwback setting as a crutch.

    This movie is excellent for what kind of movie it is. It is a feel good movie that has GREAT comedy and a romantic vibe throughout. Both Drew Barrymore and Sandler really pull together nicely. Drew's acting truly shines and puts the emotions of young love at an all time high. The Movie takes you through many mishaps and misconceptions of what can happen when trying to bring another person to love you and hope that the other loves you as well. The comedy is through the roof funny, and my wife and I have had many great quotes for our own marriage. This movie has made our lives better, and brought some great smiles and laughs to our relationship through out our 12 years of marriage.

    "The Wedding Singer" is a 1998 film starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. Frank Coraci directs this romantic comedy about a wedding singer (Sandler) struggling to find true love in a seemingly cruel world. From what I've heard about this film, it's one of Sandler's best movies. IGN actually called it his best, so needless to say I wanted to see it. Is it his best movie? I don't think so, but it's not bad. I found most of this movie to be quite entertaining. The best part of this movie is the fact that if features an almost unbearably charming soundtrack featuring a plethora of 80s classics. I love the 80s, I honestly think they were one of the best decades in American History. It was a time that featured a cultural renaissance, a solid economy, and an overall unique feel and I was glad to see that this movie embraced that period so openly. Adam Sandler is also one of the film's strongest points. I honestly did not think that he could play any other part than the lovable fool ("Waterboy") or the ill-tempered everyman ("Billy Madison"), but he can. Not saying that those parts are bad, but it's refreshing to see a change of pace every once and a while, and Sandler's performance in this film is one. Some of the jokes are filled with a little too much brown and they seem dated in a few parts, but the film's comedy is generally funny. The script is pretty predictable, but as I said it's too charming to rip apart. Anyway I found that, in the end, "The Wedding Singer" was a genuinely entertaining movie that ranks among one of Adam Sandler's best movies.

    The rare instance of a romantic comedy that stands tall and succeeds despite the trappings of its clich&eacute;-ridden genre. This by-the-numbers Adam Sandler / Drew Barrymore vehicle is rescued from mediocrity by a ridiculously good soundtrack, an unexpectedly sweet vat of chemistry between the two leads and one big, fat, steaming gob of '80s nostalgia. Sandler and Barrymore don't exactly light the screen on fire with their acting chops - in fact, most of their lines are so stiff and hammy, I'm surprised they made the cut - but there's a strange, genuine warmth that resonates between them, and the film uses those sparks to fuel a bonfire. The plot isn't as edgy and obtuse as Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, but that ultimately results in a smoother, more digestible picture that's still not without a few of Sandler's signature left-field moments. Heartfelt and funny, it's also thin enough to need the not-too-distant throwback setting as a crutch.

    This movie is excellent for what kind of movie it is. It is a feel good movie that has GREAT comedy and a romantic vibe throughout. Both Drew Barrymore and Sandler really pull together nicely. Drew's acting truly shines and puts the emotions of young love at an all time high. The Movie takes you through many mishaps and misconceptions of what can happen when trying to bring another person to love you and hope that the other loves you as well. The comedy is through the roof funny, and my wife and I have had many great quotes for our own marriage. This movie has made our lives better, and brought some great smiles and laughs to our relationship through out our 12 years of marriage.

    "The Wedding Singer" is a 1998 film starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. Frank Coraci directs this romantic comedy about a wedding singer (Sandler) struggling to find true love in a seemingly cruel world. From what I've heard about this film, it's one of Sandler's best movies. IGN actually called it his best, so needless to say I wanted to see it. Is it his best movie? I don't think so, but it's not bad. I found most of this movie to be quite entertaining. The best part of this movie is the fact that if features an almost unbearably charming soundtrack featuring a plethora of 80s classics. I love the 80s, I honestly think they were one of the best decades in American History. It was a time that featured a cultural renaissance, a solid economy, and an overall unique feel and I was glad to see that this movie embraced that period so openly. Adam Sandler is also one of the film's strongest points. I honestly did not think that he could play any other part than the lovable fool ("Waterboy") or the ill-tempered everyman ("Billy Madison"), but he can. Not saying that those parts are bad, but it's refreshing to see a change of pace every once and a while, and Sandler's performance in this film is one. Some of the jokes are filled with a little too much brown and they seem dated in a few parts, but the film's comedy is generally funny. The script is pretty predictable, but as I said it's too charming to rip apart. Anyway I found that, in the end, "The Wedding Singer" was a genuinely entertaining movie that ranks among one of Adam Sandler's best movies.

    I just saw this after having watched it once long ago, probably back in the VHS days, late nineties. I think it's still incredibly charming and funny today (in 2011). I rarely laugh out in the movies, especially alone, but I did here. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are so likable in their respective lead roles. Weirdly, I think it's because they're shown to be really sweet and compassionate and from them it seems genuine. There's such a good chemistry between those 2 and you can't help, but root for them to somehow get together. Of course, several of the funny bits come from the usual Sandler's losing his temper bits. Lots of humour comes from contrasts or switching between moods (ex.: from nice or sad to angry and back again), especially the time Sandler sings his latest composition. You shouldn't laugh, because the lyrics are so grim, but because of his performance, you can't help yourself. Consider also how hilarious it is when he sings a famous happy song, but does it so desperately. You have an amazing soundtrack full of 80s songs that are thematically right on the spot and often quite amusing (especially that famous Boy George song). I was pleased at how generally good Sandler was with the frequent singing despite his few distinctive funny voice inclinations. From the credits, it's supposed to be him and it sure looks like he's really singing instead of lip-syncing. Lots of enjoyment also comes from seeing the (now) outrageous fashions and coiffures of the 80s, as well as the inappropriate things kids and grandmas will say and do. It's obvious people who were teens or adults in the 80s will get the most of the many references, but I do think younger people will also enjoy this very much for other reasons. The Wedding Singer, despite being a romantic comedy, is not that predictable or conventional if you consider, amongst other things, how both main characters start off in a serious relationship headed for impending marriage. I even found it quite touching a few times, almost shedding a tear near the end. Paraphrasing somewhat the start of the movie, some of us, like me, will likely never ever find true love, but it's nice to keep the illusion alive by watching such a sweet-natured and genuinely funny romantic comedy. The 80s setting is a bonus, but it's the heart and laughs that make it shine. It's also something I could easily see myself watching every few years with equal pleasure. Rating: 9 out of 10 (excellent)

    The Wedding Singer is very good comedy with a blend of romantic elements. I never expected the movie to be as good as it is because of exactly that. However, this was the only Adam Sandler movie I haven't seen at this point so I gave it a try. I was very impressed. This is about a guy named Robbie Hart who is a successful wedding singer. Things turn for the worst when his wife leaves him at his own wedding. He becomes a depressed person and is on the verge of losing his job. Then he becomes best friends with a waitress. Will they fall in love? Even though Sandler is his usual typical self, he shows a heart-warming side of him. He shows some dramatic acting skills for the first time. Drew Barrymore is just fantastic as the waitress. The rest of the supporting actors were great as well. Overall, this is a funny, heart-warming film for all. This may be Adam's best movie. I rate this film 9/10.

    OK I have seen this before on TV and I thought it was funny. The movie features 50 First Date's actors Drew Barromore and Adam Sandler and tells the story of a washed singer who performs at weddings. He falls for a young waitress(Barrowmore)who is engaged to a man who doesn't really love her Robbie(sandler)himself was also suppose to marry too but his fianc&eacute; left him at the alter. Every time I watch this film I could see a similarity of Music & Lyrics which also told the story of a washed pop star who falls for a girl(Barromore again) and both actors sing(Grant & Sandler). I know I am only suppose to review one film but I could see a lot of similarities. If you like Adam Sandler and Rom Com's where you've got a guy fallen for a girl who is already taken then check it out.

    The film is a little too short, but other than that it is a funny, entertaining and charming romantic comedy. I don't care for Adam Sandler that much, as there have been movies where I have found him irritating, but here he gives one of his more likable performances because he is pitch-perfect here. Drew Barrymore is an actress I like, I think she is pretty and I think she can act(I loved her in Ever After), and she plays a truly charming romantic interest. Sandler and Barrymore's chemistry really works here, and they are supported wonderfully by some great supporting actors, Steve Buschemi being the funniest. The screenplay is funny and touching, the production values are a delight, the direction is secure and of course the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful. Overall, just a nice and entertaining feel-good film. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    It's 1985, Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) is a wedding singer from New Jersey who dreams of being a songwriter. His job doesn't pay well, but he's happy because he's good at what he does, and because he truly believes in love. Robbie's getting married to his high school sweetheart, Linda,(Angela Featherstone)and he's convinced that Linda is the girl for him While singing at the reception hall, Robbie meets a new waitress named Julia, (Drew Barrymore) she's a sweet girl who's engaged to a self-absorbed junk bond trader named Glenn Guglia (Matthew Glave) Glen drives a DeLorean and thinks he looks like Don Johnson. Just as Robbie is about to get married, Linda stands him up at the altar and breaks his heart. Brokenhearted, he stays in his sister's basement listening to depressing music and not shaving. When he goes back to work as a wedding singer, he's as sullen and depressed as ever. He sings "Love Stinks" at his first wedding after breaking up with Linda, and promptly gets punched by the groom's father. Just as things are going badly for Robbie, things start to go well for Julia, Glenn agrees to marry Julia, but wants nothing to do with planning the details of the wedding, so Julia asks Robbie to help him plan the wedding, and along the way, Robbie falls in love with her, but keeps those feelings to himself. Later, Robbie goes on a double-date with Julia's cousin, Holly (Christine Taylor) Julia and Glenn. When they're alone Glenn admits to Robbie that he's already cheated on Julia and plans to continue. Does Robbie tell Julia about Glenn's womanizing? Does he admit his own feelings about Julia to Julia? Does Julia marry Glenn, despite having feelings for Robbie? An Adam Sandler movie that's a classic? Believe it, I love this movie, because no movie encapsulates the mood of 1980's America like the Wedding Singer, the music, the clothes, the big hair, even the TV shows. It really is a sweet love story about a nice guy who believes in love, and gets his heart broken, trying to find love again. Is it predictable? Sure it is, but every romantic comedy is predictable. Half the fun of a good romantic comedy is the journey, and this is one funny ride. Adam Sandler's never made a movie before or since, that's made use of both his musical and comedic talents the way this one did. He sings some songs that he wrote, one funny, one sweet, and it really makes the part of a struggling singer more believable when the audience hears Sandler sing. Drew Barrymore's never been more appealing, sweet, vulnerable, her face filled with joy and angst at the same time. She was undeniably cute in this film, and her chemistry with Sandler was undeniable too, they tried to re-kindle that chemistry in the awful "50 First Dates" but it didn't work, proving that chemistry is a tricky thing and not just in science class. This is a movie with some standout cameos as well. Steve Buscemi is very funny as the bitter brother of one of the grooms. Jon Lovitz is hilarious as Jimmie Moore, a smarmy wedding singer who flirts with Barrymore as he sings "Ladies Night." 80's punk rocker Billy Idol has a cameo for authenticity. The writing is excellent, Tim Herlihy wrote this movie, and he wrote three of Sandler's funnier movies, this one, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy. The Wedding Singer was the best of the three. The length of the film is perfect, a little over 90 minutes, any longer for a comedy, and it starts to drag. Finally, if you want to know what the music was like in 1980's America watch this movie, it has a slice of everything, from Boy George, to the Smiths, to Huey Lewis. The songs definitely set the mood for the movie, a fun love letter to the 1980's. For more reviews to sing about, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpreess.com

    I marvel at the fact that this movie has such a low average score! But here is a top-scoring review to throw into the mix. The Wedding Singer is a great tribute to the awkward, at-times-eye-straining 80's, complete with a brilliant soundtrack and awesome wardrobe. I love the story, and Adam Sandler's character. I also think Drew Barrymore's character Julia is just so cute. I only recently realised that "George" is played by Patricia Arquette's sister Alexis, but I guess that's just another reason to love the character - the Arquettes are fabulous! In short, I believe this movie is made of pure genius. And not just because Billy Idol's in it.

    Robbie is stood up at the altar by Linda, who decides that the prospect of marrying a guy who sings at wedding receptions doesn't equal the attraction she felt when he was lead singer in a rock band. Robbie finds consolation in his friendship with Julia, a waitress at the wedding receptions and bar mitzvahs where he performs. Julia asks Robbie to help her plan her upcoming wedding to Glenn, who isn't interested in the details of the ceremony. Robbie learns that Glenn also isn't totally interested in Julia and is marrying her because she "deserves it" after sticking with him for years and because he knows she's not marrying him for his money, since she dated him back before he started pulling down the big bucks... It's not your typical Sandler movie. There are no where near as many sight gags and rants as you get in his other movies. This is 'The Ladies' Adam Sandler, as you have also seen in '50 first dates' and 'Big Daddy'. It's ultimately a chick flick with a slight Sandler Sheen. All of his regulars are here, but they play it more straighter than usual. But it's a god film. The chemistry between the two leads is fantastic, and they should make more movies together. If you, like myself, love the eighties, then this is the pinnacle tribute to the eighties. Big Hair, Big egos, and Billy Idol. A movie that will brighten your day up.

    The rare instance of a romantic comedy that stands tall and succeeds despite the trappings of its clich&eacute;-ridden genre. This by-the-numbers Adam Sandler / Drew Barrymore vehicle is rescued from mediocrity by a ridiculously good soundtrack, an unexpectedly sweet vat of chemistry between the two leads and one big, fat, steaming gob of '80s nostalgia. Sandler and Barrymore don't exactly light the screen on fire with their acting chops - in fact, most of their lines are so stiff and hammy, I'm surprised they made the cut - but there's a strange, genuine warmth that resonates between them, and the film uses those sparks to fuel a bonfire. The plot isn't as edgy and obtuse as Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, but that ultimately results in a smoother, more digestible picture that's still not without a few of Sandler's signature left-field moments. Heartfelt and funny, it's also thin enough to need the not-too-distant throwback setting as a crutch.

    I marvel at the fact that this movie has such a low average score! But here is a top-scoring review to throw into the mix. The Wedding Singer is a great tribute to the awkward, at-times-eye-straining 80's, complete with a brilliant soundtrack and awesome wardrobe. I love the story, and Adam Sandler's character. I also think Drew Barrymore's character Julia is just so cute. I only recently realised that "George" is played by Patricia Arquette's sister Alexis, but I guess that's just another reason to love the character - the Arquettes are fabulous! In short, I believe this movie is made of pure genius. And not just because Billy Idol's in it.

    Robbie is stood up at the altar by Linda, who decides that the prospect of marrying a guy who sings at wedding receptions doesn't equal the attraction she felt when he was lead singer in a rock band. Robbie finds consolation in his friendship with Julia, a waitress at the wedding receptions and bar mitzvahs where he performs. Julia asks Robbie to help her plan her upcoming wedding to Glenn, who isn't interested in the details of the ceremony. Robbie learns that Glenn also isn't totally interested in Julia and is marrying her because she "deserves it" after sticking with him for years and because he knows she's not marrying him for his money, since she dated him back before he started pulling down the big bucks... It's not your typical Sandler movie. There are no where near as many sight gags and rants as you get in his other movies. This is 'The Ladies' Adam Sandler, as you have also seen in '50 first dates' and 'Big Daddy'. It's ultimately a chick flick with a slight Sandler Sheen. All of his regulars are here, but they play it more straighter than usual. But it's a god film. The chemistry between the two leads is fantastic, and they should make more movies together. If you, like myself, love the eighties, then this is the pinnacle tribute to the eighties. Big Hair, Big egos, and Billy Idol. A movie that will brighten your day up.

    The rare instance of a romantic comedy that stands tall and succeeds despite the trappings of its clich&eacute;-ridden genre. This by-the-numbers Adam Sandler / Drew Barrymore vehicle is rescued from mediocrity by a ridiculously good soundtrack, an unexpectedly sweet vat of chemistry between the two leads and one big, fat, steaming gob of '80s nostalgia. Sandler and Barrymore don't exactly light the screen on fire with their acting chops - in fact, most of their lines are so stiff and hammy, I'm surprised they made the cut - but there's a strange, genuine warmth that resonates between them, and the film uses those sparks to fuel a bonfire. The plot isn't as edgy and obtuse as Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, but that ultimately results in a smoother, more digestible picture that's still not without a few of Sandler's signature left-field moments. Heartfelt and funny, it's also thin enough to need the not-too-distant throwback setting as a crutch.

    This movie is excellent for what kind of movie it is. It is a feel good movie that has GREAT comedy and a romantic vibe throughout. Both Drew Barrymore and Sandler really pull together nicely. Drew's acting truly shines and puts the emotions of young love at an all time high. The Movie takes you through many mishaps and misconceptions of what can happen when trying to bring another person to love you and hope that the other loves you as well. The comedy is through the roof funny, and my wife and I have had many great quotes for our own marriage. This movie has made our lives better, and brought some great smiles and laughs to our relationship through out our 12 years of marriage.

    "The Wedding Singer" is a 1998 film starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. Frank Coraci directs this romantic comedy about a wedding singer (Sandler) struggling to find true love in a seemingly cruel world. From what I've heard about this film, it's one of Sandler's best movies. IGN actually called it his best, so needless to say I wanted to see it. Is it his best movie? I don't think so, but it's not bad. I found most of this movie to be quite entertaining. The best part of this movie is the fact that if features an almost unbearably charming soundtrack featuring a plethora of 80s classics. I love the 80s, I honestly think they were one of the best decades in American History. It was a time that featured a cultural renaissance, a solid economy, and an overall unique feel and I was glad to see that this movie embraced that period so openly. Adam Sandler is also one of the film's strongest points. I honestly did not think that he could play any other part than the lovable fool ("Waterboy") or the ill-tempered everyman ("Billy Madison"), but he can. Not saying that those parts are bad, but it's refreshing to see a change of pace every once and a while, and Sandler's performance in this film is one. Some of the jokes are filled with a little too much brown and they seem dated in a few parts, but the film's comedy is generally funny. The script is pretty predictable, but as I said it's too charming to rip apart. Anyway I found that, in the end, "The Wedding Singer" was a genuinely entertaining movie that ranks among one of Adam Sandler's best movies.

    I just saw this after having watched it once long ago, probably back in the VHS days, late nineties. I think it's still incredibly charming and funny today (in 2011). I rarely laugh out in the movies, especially alone, but I did here. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are so likable in their respective lead roles. Weirdly, I think it's because they're shown to be really sweet and compassionate and from them it seems genuine. There's such a good chemistry between those 2 and you can't help, but root for them to somehow get together. Of course, several of the funny bits come from the usual Sandler's losing his temper bits. Lots of humour comes from contrasts or switching between moods (ex.: from nice or sad to angry and back again), especially the time Sandler sings his latest composition. You shouldn't laugh, because the lyrics are so grim, but because of his performance, you can't help yourself. Consider also how hilarious it is when he sings a famous happy song, but does it so desperately. You have an amazing soundtrack full of 80s songs that are thematically right on the spot and often quite amusing (especially that famous Boy George song). I was pleased at how generally good Sandler was with the frequent singing despite his few distinctive funny voice inclinations. From the credits, it's supposed to be him and it sure looks like he's really singing instead of lip-syncing. Lots of enjoyment also comes from seeing the (now) outrageous fashions and coiffures of the 80s, as well as the inappropriate things kids and grandmas will say and do. It's obvious people who were teens or adults in the 80s will get the most of the many references, but I do think younger people will also enjoy this very much for other reasons. The Wedding Singer, despite being a romantic comedy, is not that predictable or conventional if you consider, amongst other things, how both main characters start off in a serious relationship headed for impending marriage. I even found it quite touching a few times, almost shedding a tear near the end. Paraphrasing somewhat the start of the movie, some of us, like me, will likely never ever find true love, but it's nice to keep the illusion alive by watching such a sweet-natured and genuinely funny romantic comedy. The 80s setting is a bonus, but it's the heart and laughs that make it shine. It's also something I could easily see myself watching every few years with equal pleasure. Rating: 9 out of 10 (excellent)

    The Wedding Singer is very good comedy with a blend of romantic elements. I never expected the movie to be as good as it is because of exactly that. However, this was the only Adam Sandler movie I haven't seen at this point so I gave it a try. I was very impressed. This is about a guy named Robbie Hart who is a successful wedding singer. Things turn for the worst when his wife leaves him at his own wedding. He becomes a depressed person and is on the verge of losing his job. Then he becomes best friends with a waitress. Will they fall in love? Even though Sandler is his usual typical self, he shows a heart-warming side of him. He shows some dramatic acting skills for the first time. Drew Barrymore is just fantastic as the waitress. The rest of the supporting actors were great as well. Overall, this is a funny, heart-warming film for all. This may be Adam's best movie. I rate this film 9/10.

    OK I have seen this before on TV and I thought it was funny. The movie features 50 First Date's actors Drew Barromore and Adam Sandler and tells the story of a washed singer who performs at weddings. He falls for a young waitress(Barrowmore)who is engaged to a man who doesn't really love her Robbie(sandler)himself was also suppose to marry too but his fianc&eacute; left him at the alter. Every time I watch this film I could see a similarity of Music & Lyrics which also told the story of a washed pop star who falls for a girl(Barromore again) and both actors sing(Grant & Sandler). I know I am only suppose to review one film but I could see a lot of similarities. If you like Adam Sandler and Rom Com's where you've got a guy fallen for a girl who is already taken then check it out.

    The film is a little too short, but other than that it is a funny, entertaining and charming romantic comedy. I don't care for Adam Sandler that much, as there have been movies where I have found him irritating, but here he gives one of his more likable performances because he is pitch-perfect here. Drew Barrymore is an actress I like, I think she is pretty and I think she can act(I loved her in Ever After), and she plays a truly charming romantic interest. Sandler and Barrymore's chemistry really works here, and they are supported wonderfully by some great supporting actors, Steve Buschemi being the funniest. The screenplay is funny and touching, the production values are a delight, the direction is secure and of course the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful. Overall, just a nice and entertaining feel-good film. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    It's 1985, Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) is a wedding singer from New Jersey who dreams of being a songwriter. His job doesn't pay well, but he's happy because he's good at what he does, and because he truly believes in love. Robbie's getting married to his high school sweetheart, Linda,(Angela Featherstone)and he's convinced that Linda is the girl for him While singing at the reception hall, Robbie meets a new waitress named Julia, (Drew Barrymore) she's a sweet girl who's engaged to a self-absorbed junk bond trader named Glenn Guglia (Matthew Glave) Glen drives a DeLorean and thinks he looks like Don Johnson. Just as Robbie is about to get married, Linda stands him up at the altar and breaks his heart. Brokenhearted, he stays in his sister's basement listening to depressing music and not shaving. When he goes back to work as a wedding singer, he's as sullen and depressed as ever. He sings "Love Stinks" at his first wedding after breaking up with Linda, and promptly gets punched by the groom's father. Just as things are going badly for Robbie, things start to go well for Julia, Glenn agrees to marry Julia, but wants nothing to do with planning the details of the wedding, so Julia asks Robbie to help him plan the wedding, and along the way, Robbie falls in love with her, but keeps those feelings to himself. Later, Robbie goes on a double-date with Julia's cousin, Holly (Christine Taylor) Julia and Glenn. When they're alone Glenn admits to Robbie that he's already cheated on Julia and plans to continue. Does Robbie tell Julia about Glenn's womanizing? Does he admit his own feelings about Julia to Julia? Does Julia marry Glenn, despite having feelings for Robbie? An Adam Sandler movie that's a classic? Believe it, I love this movie, because no movie encapsulates the mood of 1980's America like the Wedding Singer, the music, the clothes, the big hair, even the TV shows. It really is a sweet love story about a nice guy who believes in love, and gets his heart broken, trying to find love again. Is it predictable? Sure it is, but every romantic comedy is predictable. Half the fun of a good romantic comedy is the journey, and this is one funny ride. Adam Sandler's never made a movie before or since, that's made use of both his musical and comedic talents the way this one did. He sings some songs that he wrote, one funny, one sweet, and it really makes the part of a struggling singer more believable when the audience hears Sandler sing. Drew Barrymore's never been more appealing, sweet, vulnerable, her face filled with joy and angst at the same time. She was undeniably cute in this film, and her chemistry with Sandler was undeniable too, they tried to re-kindle that chemistry in the awful "50 First Dates" but it didn't work, proving that chemistry is a tricky thing and not just in science class. This is a movie with some standout cameos as well. Steve Buscemi is very funny as the bitter brother of one of the grooms. Jon Lovitz is hilarious as Jimmie Moore, a smarmy wedding singer who flirts with Barrymore as he sings "Ladies Night." 80's punk rocker Billy Idol has a cameo for authenticity. The writing is excellent, Tim Herlihy wrote this movie, and he wrote three of Sandler's funnier movies, this one, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy. The Wedding Singer was the best of the three. The length of the film is perfect, a little over 90 minutes, any longer for a comedy, and it starts to drag. Finally, if you want to know what the music was like in 1980's America watch this movie, it has a slice of everything, from Boy George, to the Smiths, to Huey Lewis. The songs definitely set the mood for the movie, a fun love letter to the 1980's. For more reviews to sing about, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpreess.com

    I marvel at the fact that this movie has such a low average score! But here is a top-scoring review to throw into the mix. The Wedding Singer is a great tribute to the awkward, at-times-eye-straining 80's, complete with a brilliant soundtrack and awesome wardrobe. I love the story, and Adam Sandler's character. I also think Drew Barrymore's character Julia is just so cute. I only recently realised that "George" is played by Patricia Arquette's sister Alexis, but I guess that's just another reason to love the character - the Arquettes are fabulous! In short, I believe this movie is made of pure genius. And not just because Billy Idol's in it.

    The rare instance of a romantic comedy that stands tall and succeeds despite the trappings of its clich&eacute;-ridden genre. This by-the-numbers Adam Sandler / Drew Barrymore vehicle is rescued from mediocrity by a ridiculously good soundtrack, an unexpectedly sweet vat of chemistry between the two leads and one big, fat, steaming gob of '80s nostalgia. Sandler and Barrymore don't exactly light the screen on fire with their acting chops - in fact, most of their lines are so stiff and hammy, I'm surprised they made the cut - but there's a strange, genuine warmth that resonates between them, and the film uses those sparks to fuel a bonfire. The plot isn't as edgy and obtuse as Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, but that ultimately results in a smoother, more digestible picture that's still not without a few of Sandler's signature left-field moments. Heartfelt and funny, it's also thin enough to need the not-too-distant throwback setting as a crutch.

Just as things are going badly for Robbie, things start to go well for Julia, Glenn agrees to marry Julia, but wants nothing to do with planning the details of the wedding, so Julia asks Robbie to help him plan the wedding, and along the way, Robbie falls in love with her, but keeps those feelings to himself. Later, Robbie goes on a double-date with Julia's cousin, Holly (Christine Taylor) Julia and Glenn. When they're alone Glenn admits to Robbie that he's already cheated on Julia and plans to continue. Does Robbie tell Julia about Glenn's womanizing? Does he admit his own feelings about Julia to Julia? Does Julia marry Glenn, despite having feelings for Robbie? An Adam Sandler movie that's a classic? Believe it, I love this movie, because no movie encapsulates the mood of 1980's America like the Wedding Singer, the music, the clothes, the big hair, even the TV shows. It really is a sweet love story about a nice guy who believes in love, and gets his heart broken, trying to find love again. Is it predictable? Sure it is, but every romantic comedy is predictable. Half the fun of a good romantic comedy is the journey, and this is one funny ride. Adam Sandler's never made a movie before or since, that's made use of both his musical and comedic talents the way this one did. He sings some songs that he wrote, one funny, one sweet, and it really makes the part of a struggling singer more believable when the audience hears Sandler sing. Drew Barrymore's never been more appealing, sweet, vulnerable, her face filled with joy and angst at the same time. She was undeniably cute in this film, and her chemistry with Sandler was undeniable too, they tried to re-kindle that chemistry in the awful "50 First Dates" but it didn't work, proving that chemistry is a tricky thing and not just in science class. This is a movie with some standout cameos as well. Steve Buscemi is very funny as the bitter brother of one of the grooms. Jon Lovitz is hilarious as Jimmie Moore, a smarmy wedding singer who flirts with Barrymore as he sings "Ladies Night." 80's punk rocker Billy Idol has a cameo for authenticity. The writing is excellent, Tim Herlihy wrote this movie, and he wrote three of Sandler's funnier movies, this one, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy. The Wedding Singer was the best of the three. The length of the film is perfect, a little over 90 minutes, any longer for a comedy, and it starts to drag. Finally, if you want to know what the music was like in 1980's America watch this movie, it has a slice of everything, from Boy George, to the Smiths, to Huey Lewis. The songs definitely set the mood for the movie, a fun love letter to the 1980's. For more reviews to sing about, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpreess.com

    I marvel at the fact that this movie has such a low average score! But here is a top-scoring review to throw into the mix. The Wedding Singer is a great tribute to the awkward, at-times-eye-straining 80's, complete with a brilliant soundtrack and awesome wardrobe. I love the story, and Adam Sandler's character. I also think Drew Barrymore's character Julia is just so cute. I only recently realised that "George" is played by Patricia Arquette's sister Alexis, but I guess that's just another reason to love the character - the Arquettes are fabulous! In short, I believe this movie is made of pure genius. And not just because Billy Idol's in it.

    Robbie is stood up at the altar by Linda, who decides that the prospect of marrying a guy who sings at wedding receptions doesn't equal the attraction she felt when he was lead singer in a rock band. Robbie finds consolation in his friendship with Julia, a waitress at the wedding receptions and bar mitzvahs where he performs. Julia asks Robbie to help her plan her upcoming wedding to Glenn, who isn't interested in the details of the ceremony. Robbie learns that Glenn also isn't totally interested in Julia and is marrying her because she "deserves it" after sticking with him for years and because he knows she's not marrying him for his money, since she dated him back before he started pulling down the big bucks... It's not your typical Sandler movie. There are no where near as many sight gags and rants as you get in his other movies. This is 'The Ladies' Adam Sandler, as you have also seen in '50 first dates' and 'Big Daddy'. It's ultimately a chick flick with a slight Sandler Sheen. All of his regulars are here, but they play it more straighter than usual. But it's a god film. The chemistry between the two leads is fantastic, and they should make more movies together. If you, like myself, love the eighties, then this is the pinnacle tribute to the eighties. Big Hair, Big egos, and Billy Idol. A movie that will brighten your day up.

    Sandler and Barrymore's Unique Chemistry Sets This Rom Com Apart

    The rare instance of a romantic comedy that stands tall and succeeds despite the trappings of its clich&eacute;-ridden genre. This by-the-numbers Adam Sandler / Drew Barrymore vehicle is rescued from mediocrity by a ridiculously good soundtrack, an unexpectedly sweet vat of chemistry between the two leads and one big, fat, steaming gob of '80s nostalgia. Sandler and Barrymore don't exactly light the screen on fire with their acting chops - in fact, most of their lines are so stiff and hammy, I'm surprised they made the cut - but there's a strange, genuine warmth that resonates between them, and the film uses those sparks to fuel a bonfire. The plot isn't as edgy and obtuse as Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, but that ultimately results in a smoother, more digestible picture that's still not without a few of Sandler's signature left-field moments. Heartfelt and funny, it's also thin enough to need the not-too-distant throwback setting as a crutch.

    This movie is excellent for what kind of movie it is. It is a feel good movie that has GREAT comedy and a romantic vibe throughout. Both Drew Barrymore and Sandler really pull together nicely. Drew's acting truly shines and puts the emotions of young love at an all time high. The Movie takes you through many mishaps and misconceptions of what can happen when trying to bring another person to love you and hope that the other loves you as well. The comedy is through the roof funny, and my wife and I have had many great quotes for our own marriage. This movie has made our lives better, and brought some great smiles and laughs to our relationship through out our 12 years of marriage.

    "The Wedding Singer" is a 1998 film starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. Frank Coraci directs this romantic comedy about a wedding singer (Sandler) struggling to find true love in a seemingly cruel world. From what I've heard about this film, it's one of Sandler's best movies. IGN actually called it his best, so needless to say I wanted to see it. Is it his best movie? I don't think so, but it's not bad. I found most of this movie to be quite entertaining. The best part of this movie is the fact that if features an almost unbearably charming soundtrack featuring a plethora of 80s classics. I love the 80s, I honestly think they were one of the best decades in American History. It was a time that featured a cultural renaissance, a solid economy, and an overall unique feel and I was glad to see that this movie embraced that period so openly. Adam Sandler is also one of the film's strongest points. I honestly did not think that he could play any other part than the lovable fool ("Waterboy") or the ill-tempered everyman ("Billy Madison"), but he can. Not saying that those parts are bad, but it's refreshing to see a change of pace every once and a while, and Sandler's performance in this film is one. Some of the jokes are filled with a little too much brown and they seem dated in a few parts, but the film's comedy is generally funny. The script is pretty predictable, but as I said it's too charming to rip apart. Anyway I found that, in the end, "The Wedding Singer" was a genuinely entertaining movie that ranks among one of Adam Sandler's best movies.

    I just saw this after having watched it once long ago, probably back in the VHS days, late nineties. I think it's still incredibly charming and funny today (in 2011). I rarely laugh out in the movies, especially alone, but I did here. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are so likable in their respective lead roles. Weirdly, I think it's because they're shown to be really sweet and compassionate and from them it seems genuine. There's such a good chemistry between those 2 and you can't help, but root for them to somehow get together. Of course, several of the funny bits come from the usual Sandler's losing his temper bits. Lots of humour comes from contrasts or switching between moods (ex.: from nice or sad to angry and back again), especially the time Sandler sings his latest composition. You shouldn't laugh, because the lyrics are so grim, but because of his performance, you can't help yourself. Consider also how hilarious it is when he sings a famous happy song, but does it so desperately. You have an amazing soundtrack full of 80s songs that are thematically right on the spot and often quite amusing (especially that famous Boy George song). I was pleased at how generally good Sandler was with the frequent singing despite his few distinctive funny voice inclinations. From the credits, it's supposed to be him and it sure looks like he's really singing instead of lip-syncing. Lots of enjoyment also comes from seeing the (now) outrageous fashions and coiffures of the 80s, as well as the inappropriate things kids and grandmas will say and do. It's obvious people who were teens or adults in the 80s will get the most of the many references, but I do think younger people will also enjoy this very much for other reasons. The Wedding Singer, despite being a romantic comedy, is not that predictable or conventional if you consider, amongst other things, how both main characters start off in a serious relationship headed for impending marriage. I even found it quite touching a few times, almost shedding a tear near the end. Paraphrasing somewhat the start of the movie, some of us, like me, will likely never ever find true love, but it's nice to keep the illusion alive by watching such a sweet-natured and genuinely funny romantic comedy. The 80s setting is a bonus, but it's the heart and laughs that make it shine. It's also something I could easily see myself watching every few years with equal pleasure. Rating: 9 out of 10 (excellent)

    The Wedding Singer is very good comedy with a blend of romantic elements. I never expected the movie to be as good as it is because of exactly that. However, this was the only Adam Sandler movie I haven't seen at this point so I gave it a try. I was very impressed. This is about a guy named Robbie Hart who is a successful wedding singer. Things turn for the worst when his wife leaves him at his own wedding. He becomes a depressed person and is on the verge of losing his job. Then he becomes best friends with a waitress. Will they fall in love? Even though Sandler is his usual typical self, he shows a heart-warming side of him. He shows some dramatic acting skills for the first time. Drew Barrymore is just fantastic as the waitress. The rest of the supporting actors were great as well. Overall, this is a funny, heart-warming film for all. This may be Adam's best movie. I rate this film 9/10.

    OK I have seen this before on TV and I thought it was funny. The movie features 50 First Date's actors Drew Barromore and Adam Sandler and tells the story of a washed singer who performs at weddings. He falls for a young waitress(Barrowmore)who is engaged to a man who doesn't really love her Robbie(sandler)himself was also suppose to marry too but his fianc&eacute; left him at the alter. Every time I watch this film I could see a similarity of Music & Lyrics which also told the story of a washed pop star who falls for a girl(Barromore again) and both actors sing(Grant & Sandler). I know I am only suppose to review one film but I could see a lot of similarities. If you like Adam Sandler and Rom Com's where you've got a guy fallen for a girl who is already taken then check it out.

    The film is a little too short, but other than that it is a funny, entertaining and charming romantic comedy. I don't care for Adam Sandler that much, as there have been movies where I have found him irritating, but here he gives one of his more likable performances because he is pitch-perfect here. Drew Barrymore is an actress I like, I think she is pretty and I think she can act(I loved her in Ever After), and she plays a truly charming romantic interest. Sandler and Barrymore's chemistry really works here, and they are supported wonderfully by some great supporting actors, Steve Buschemi being the funniest. The screenplay is funny and touching, the production values are a delight, the direction is secure and of course the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful. Overall, just a nice and entertaining feel-good film. 8/10 Bethany Cox
