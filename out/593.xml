    It's hard to deny this is an excellent film. Impeccable acting, direction and photography create a powerful depiction of war at its most miserable, futile and degrading. But I do think two mild criticisms need to be stated. First, a movie titled "Stalingrad" ought to present at least some vague overview of that historical battle. Aside from a few confusing references to the wider tactical situation, this move sticks to a worms-eye view. After a while, you even have to wonder whether the travails of this particular group of soldiers are at all typical of the huge German force involved at the time. The film works as drama, but if you call it simply "Stalingrad," I think you're promising a bit of historical context. Second, the pace is a tiny bit over-drawn. In the last third of the film, I reached an atrocity overload, where further horrors had progressively less impact. I began to disconnect from the characters, remaining only mildly curious as to what agonizingly tragic ways would be found to dispatch them. A stronger dramatic hook is needed, to pull us through the admitted hopelessness of this last segment. These are far from fatal flaws. It's more a question of balance. A bit more context, a slightly tighter narrative, and this could have been a masterpiece. As it is, I'd say it's a really excellent film, that does show - unforgettably - how war deadens the soul, even if it fails to kill the body. Still, I have to hope that other filmmakers will one day present a broader view of the battle of Stalingrad. There's still lots of historical ground that needs to be covered, if future generations are to understand the madness that created this nightmarish conflict.

    Stalingrad is not the best war film. At times, I found the sub-par acting by extras and use of stock sound effects really killed the depth of a scene. I also found that I couldn't keep a track of which characters were which, this may have been due to similar faces and language barriers creating trouble with indistinguishable accents. Between scenes, there would be such large gaps in time that you wouldn't be able to tell how a situation arose or what the situation was in some cases, making the story hard to follow. These factors limited my ability to feel the exhaustion and suffering of the characters, and left me slightly disengaged. The reason for my high mark, however, is attributed to the final scenes. The raw emotion coming from the few remaining actors is highly visible on this precious smaller scope, and the eventual plight of each character is played out in such devastating detail that I sat in silence in a dark room long after the credits had finished rolling and felt compelled after to even write some poetry. If you came to this film to see the struggle of a battle, you could do better, but stick around for the ending, it's very much worth it.

    For losers of a war or a battle, it is not customary to create something depicting their defeat, especially if this happened not so long time ago. E.g., Russians have had several defeats in the post WW II period - could you imagine them picturing this? With Stalingrad 1993, Germans have crudely shown the horrors and sufferings in one of the most severe battles in the WW II, without glorifying themselves and without scoffing at their enemy. On the other hand, Soviet Russia was no innocent victim, its treatment of own and neighboring people in the 1930ies was nasty and lethal as well, and Soviet (non-)activities were largely a reason why Hitler had courage to start this horrible war. As for the movie, the events and background seem realistic (probably shot in Finland), most of actors performing Russians speak decent Russian, and leading men are catchy to follow (primarily Dominique Horwitz as Obergefreiter Fritz Reiser, Thomas Kretschmann as Leutnant Hans Von Witzland, Jochen Nickel as Unteroffizier Manfred "Rollo" Rohleder). However, some of the scenes could have been shortened, and direct battle scenes comprise only a small part of the movie. The ending is predictable, although the scenes leading to it are well directed. It seems that the creators wanted to combine profound human aspect with concrete battle, but for this task, the movie was too short - a miniseries could have been more appropriate. Nevertheless, if you like war movies based on real events, Stalingrad is worth watching.

    The movie has a lot of good points, as have been shown in other review. However, the battle scenes in this movie are a little bit silly in my eyes: 1. At the beginning battle of the movie, the storm company (or battalion?) was tasked to overwhelm the defenders of the factory. The captain wanted to close the quarter quietly and launch the offensive without rousing the defenders. Yet, a rifle was fired unwillingly by an infantry who jumped in, which waked up the defenders and caused a lot of casualties in the attacking force. Later, the captain gave the soldier a hand-grenade to eliminate the machine-gun which is mowing down the German soldiers. That soldier just ran toward the machine-gun without much dodging movements, not even lowering his body. And he didn't get mowed down by the machine-gun. This contradicted the usual common sense. What's more, the German hand-grenade's advantage is its throwing distance, but the explosive in it is not as much as the U.S. fragmentation ones. So I am quite doubtful that a potato-masher would destroy a machine-gun pillbox, as shown in the movie. Plus, Stalingrad would not have gained its nickname "Street-fight Academy" if the defender's position is so easy to overthrow. In the ruins of the Stalingrad, it is impossible to imagine such a single machine-gun pillbox without supporting cross-fire from other directions. If it were that simple, the 6th Army would have captured the city long before the winter began. 2. In the middle of the movie, over the snow-covered steppe, Lieutenant Witzland's platoon is ordered to hold an area where the Russian wanted to break in with their tanks. The soldiers either used Panzerfaust to give the tank a direct hit, or waited in the foxhole until the tank rolled over, and attached the ad-hoc high-explosive to its rear-engine part to break it down. After that, the infantry soldiers attached to the tank or behind it were mowed down by German MP40 or MG42. As far as I know, the usual way of fighting with a mixed mechanized formation is to let the infantry soldiers come forward to scout the hidden enemy fire positions, to expose them and let them be licked up by the up-coming tanks. No, the tanks would never thrust forward by themselves. That way, they would be easy targets for Panzerfausts or Bazookas. The tanks would go all by themselves only in very large formations, say, a tank division or a tank army. In that case, the enemy would not have a chance to come behind the leading tanks and explode them from behind - anyone who tried to do this would be mowed down by the machine-gun in the following-up tanks. In short, the movie is successful in humanizing the German soldiers fighting in Stalingrad, but it made a big mistake in over-simplifying the battle scenes and under-estimating the Russian force too much, just the same errors commit by the Fuhrer and General Staff of Wehrmacht. The Russian would not have won the Battle of Stalingrad if they fought in the way described in the movie.

    A battalion of German soldiers from the Afrika Corps are spending some time at an Italian port during the summer of 1942. At that particular time their spirits were high as the German army was in the process of advancing victoriously into Russia. But all that was subject to change as their next assignment would be: Stalingrad. And they had no idea what was in store for them. At any rate, told from the German perspective, this film does a remarkable job of showing the hardships and tragedy these soldiers had to endure. Despite proving themselves in battle, their courage and discipline was being tested as much by the Russian winter as it was their Russian foes. And yet they continued on all the same. Now, while everybody knows how this battle eventually played out, this movie allows the viewer to gain a unique understanding of how it may have appeared through the eyes of the German soldier. Definitely worth a watch for those who can appreciate a film of this type.

    The battle of Stalingrad is beyond human imagination . It is an event in history that sends a shiver down the spine . Nazi Germany lost one quarter of its total strength on the Eastern front during this one battle . That's if you can even call it a battle , the number of forces involved meant it was more of campaign . And if the scale of the battle wasn't mind numbing enough it's the conditions and ferocity of the fighting that sticks in the mind . As a young schoolboy in the 1970s I vividly remember reading accounts " that every brick in every house in every street was bitterly fought over " . Even in the 21st century with the invasion of Iraq military experts have to emphasise that the capture of Baghdad wouldn't resemble Stalingrad in anyway . In short if you want to visualize war at its most cruel and brutal pick up a history book on Stalingrad . You almost feel sorry for the bad guys . I did say " almost" This is a slight problem with this cinematic account of the battle . STALINGRAD is a very well regarded German film and being a German film it feels the need to make a very clear line between good Germans who are portrayed as the ones who are conscripted in to the Wermacht who do all the fighting and dying in pursuit of Nazi ideals and bad Germans who blindly follow Nazi genocidal laws and never serve in the front line. Even the classic DAS BOOT suffers from this viewpoint . The only film that doesn't portray villains as Nazis is the Anglo German production CROSS OF IRON which has a Prussian aristocrat as the bad German . Would it not be a nice change that Germans murdering innocent people weren't necessarily goose stepping Nazis ? The truth is there were plenty of ordinary Wermacht units implicated in crimes against humanity on the Eastern front in the early 1940s For the majority of the film director Joseph Vilsmaier and screenwriter Jurgen Buscher tend to ignore politics and concentrate on making an anti-war film on a grand epic scale . They succeed too as a battalion of 400 men is quickly drained to a troop of 62 men carrying out full frontal assaults against desperate Soviet defenders . The film makers also make a very important point that Nazi Germany was a Christian nation and include a scene where a padre addresses a congregation emphasising that the Germans have God on their side where as the Bolsheviks are Godless atheists . This scene alone meant I could easily forgive the slight clich&eacute;s that creep in to the film Slight clich&eacute;s are easily forgiven . Unfortunately the more the film goes on the more clich&eacute;s come firing at the audience quicker than a Soviet counter-attack . What become even more unforgivable is the introduction of very contrived plotting as in " Someone must do something unlikely and even more unlikely a character who they already know appears to move the plot forward " A number of people who dislike this movie have pointed out the unlikely coincidences of characters who appeared in the film earlier appear and they're right . It's not enough to destroy the film but a battle on the scale of Stalingrad to have people bumping in to each other the way it happens here strains all credibility . Likewise the final third of the film is rather static where people have existentialist discussions and feels more like a German New Wave film from Rainer Werner Fassbinder In short STALINGRAD is a film I always wanted to see since it was released almost 20 years ago . It was worth the wait . It's a sweeping epic war film and is much praised for the battle sequences . It isn't flawless and unfortunately the flaws are very easy to spot and take issue with . As it stands CROSS OF IRON still remains the best film featuring the carnage and hell of fighting on the Eastern front

    Being a WW2 fan, i was a bit late to see this brilliant movie. Although there are not many movies which are shot in German POV, i find this movie full of uncompromising quality and workmanship. Its visually breathtaking, the battle scenes are brutal and chilling, even the conditions are so unbearable and yet greatly filmed. The Story line is unevenly told and lacks a neat narration. The actions scenes stop abruptly and lacking a final punch. At times, the movie drags on and on. The lead actors are good if not great. I feel that with the kind of brilliant setup the film crew had, they could have shot few more brutal action scenes instead of dragging the whole movie. If you really want to have a very few taste of German sympathy towards Communist counterparts, this is the flick and its aptly shown in bits and pieces.

    I would daresay this is a better war film than 'The Schindler's list'. We have seen many war films from the point of views of Russians, Jews, Poles etc. But this was my first world war 2 movie seen from a German soldier's point of view. The film starts when a battalion of German soldiers are ordered to go to Stalingrad. When they think about going to Stalingrad, they think of farms and greenery but when they reach Stalingrad, the truth is far different than the reality. The German soldiers think they could win Russia within a month, their very notion turns into disbelief as they enter Stalingrad, and see thousands of wounded German soldiers. Stalingrad war was indeed the biggest mistake of Germany, and it proved the beginning of the end for Germany, and resurrection of Russia. One thing I always wondered as a child, when a war is waged why there is no confusion, how always a particular army perfectly distinguishes its soldiers from the opponents'. In the very beginning, when Germans invade Stalingrad, we see a massive confusion within the battalion and a German soldier inadvertently kills his fellow soldier. As you may do research, you will find that there was a huge chaos during the world war 2 and such incidents occurred. One thing that the director wants to convey is that all the German soldiers were not blood grubbing monsters, even they were tired of killing other people, even they wanted to go home. But they had no options, if they didn't kill , they would have been killed by their superiors. This thing is evident when a young Russian boy is captured by the German army, and the soldiers who are protagonists in the movie are told to shoot the boy with dozens of other people. They are reluctant to shoot the boy, but their fascist superior warns them that if they didn't shoot those civilians, they would be next in queue. Stalingrad is an attempt by the director to earn some sympathy for the German soldiers, who were always seen as culprits, but this film shows they were victims too. I don't want to get into the war crimes that Germans committed in Russia and other nations, but when you view a film you have to see it impartially. At the very outset of the film, it is very much clear that you are not going to see a happy end as you see in Hollywood. This film makes 'Enemy at the gates' look a very cheap film which is far from reality, as it creates Rachel Weisz's character in the film. This film is not for the people who want to see war films just for the sake of explosions and killings of people. We see scenes in the film where a German soldier shares his bread with a civilian, and also in the end when the Hans Von Witzland refuses to rape a helpless Russian female soldier. This film tells us about the fate of the soldiers who were stuck there and knew what was coming to them. In fact, this movie tells us about the harsh reality of war and it tells that the war is always bad, and there is no winner in a war. This film doesn't show that Russians were bad despite being a German film, nor it shows that Germans were heroes, but still makes its point of earning sympathy for all the soldiers who lost their lives in the battle of Stalingrad.

    A disappointing movie. There are so many things wrong with Stal. that I could spend this review listing them. First, you have to be aware that certain words carry great promise, a promise that has to be fulfilled at the end or you'll disappoint your audience. Such is the case with "Stalingrad". Most of what's wrong with Stal. comes from the approach the filmmakers took. It's clear they thought that to add up another epic to their resume all they had to do was take inland the crew of Das Boot and put them in the cauldron of Stalingrad. Big mistake. There is an enormous difference of context and nature between both cases. If there was one single "clean" form of war during WWII, at least in the European theater, that was the naval war. There were no Nazi atrocities, no Waffen SS, no Shoah on Atlantic waters, so any German director is free to present his characters as regular sailors doing their duty. But that stops there. Once the action moves to the Eastern front, you cannot possibly keep presenting them under the same light. We do know Germans were the bad guys in the USSR and that's good enough for me, so dramatizations of their suffering and dying over there leave me quite indifferent. I wish German directors stopped presenting their WWII soldiers as just poor guys who got a raw deal, who suffered as much as their victims and who deserve our compassion. Funny thing, I don't see them as such poor saps in stock footage, while they were winning. Also don't talk to me, please, about "humanity in war". There is not such thing and that's the genius of films like Coppola's AN or Malick's TTRL: they show us war as it is, as a brutal, unmitigated, carnage where men lose their souls and become bloodthirsty dogs. In Stalingrad there was no other idea in the minds of all Soviet and German soldiers than to kill as many enemies as they could. Only because of that, Enemy At The Gates is far closer to the historic truth. But the "Das Boot "approach is not only wrong because it distorts the historic truth but also because it deprives the flick of an appropriate set up. The Italian beaches with its relaxing German soldiers--copycat of the Boot's partyrobs the opportunity for a tension creating intro, like the crossing of the Volga and the massacre of Russians in EATG. Those terrible scenes throw you headfirst into the battle, creating a sordid atmosphere which remains for the rest of the flick. You sit in awe for the length of it because you have been shaken to the bones with the raw brutality of it allKhrushchev selecting officers to be shot, Russian soldiers being mowed down like cattle--even more so when you know all, or most, really happened. EATG has been savaged by purists for distorting the historic truth, yet it has the merit of giving us an eloquent picture of what Stalingrad really was. The ever present darkness, the sordid surroundings, the atmosphere of death and decay, the stoic--yet without any illusion about their own survival--snipers. Battle scenes in Stal. instead seem to have been shot on home plate in Yankee Stadium; they are drowning in light, which ruins the atmosphere; its only in the gutter scene that we really get the feel. Also, EATG focuses mostly on a little known, yet fascinating, episode: the battle of the snipers, which makes for a far better packaged movie. Stal. instead wastes miles of film in inane bickering amongst the Germans, in futile conflicts between good and evil (the "evil German" is such a cartoon guy I doubt someone like that ever existed) and in skirmishes that appear staged, probably based on pictures of the real battle. Technically this is not a great flick movie either. The cinematography is standard and the directing so--so. I already mentioned the excess light. The pacing is stilted and the editing terrible. You are suddenly thrown in the midst of battle, not knowing how you got there--and as suddenly the action stops. Also, lack of continuity, some scenes just tacked there for no reason (the Russian woman with her baby). Subplots that keep popping up but lead nowhere (The Russian uncle and soldier for ex.). Stal. could have been better it focused instead on an overview of the whole battle and on Von Paulus' conflicted personality and behavior. The director took a gamble here and lost it; at least amongst those who think the Germans got what they deserved. With it settled, most of the empathy is gone. Schmaltzy scenes--let's save the boy from execution, or let's give them bread--don't ring true and instead only make things worse for the "humanity in war" theory. Even worse is the scene between the Russian girl and Witzland. Is she offended because he didn't rape her? Wow. Also, the battle in the snow is unrealistic. Had the Soviets fought like that they would have never won. (when attacked like that you spread out your tanks--not run them into entrenched infantry). But of course the Germans had to win, so they could last to the end of the movie. The best part, the only good one, is the ending, the unlikely trio treading through snow, going nowhere. Had the filmmakers started with that image, concept, and worked backwards this could have been a better flick In all, interesting enough to see once but not enough to remember it. 5.5/10.

    There was a time when I thought war films were just a bunch of random extras being killed. However when I looked at the ones that weren't American I found that War films can truly grip you and make you say "War is pointless". This is one of those "war is pointless" movies. Before anybody splits hairs in asking how the soldiers are portrayed then I will say something. This movie portrays them as soldiers going through a hellish war, just like the Finnish movie Talvisota (one I would HIGHLY recommend for fans of this movie). For other aspects of the film, it is well acted, the message came across loud and clear, nothing is Hollywood in this movie in terms of portrayal or anything else. I was expecting the ending because the producers were the same people who produced Das Boot For those people that want to see a fantastic war film about the front line should watch this.

That soldier just ran toward the machine-gun without much dodging movements, not even lowering his body. And he didn't get mowed down by the machine-gun. This contradicted the usual common sense. What's more, the German hand-grenade's advantage is its throwing distance, but the explosive in it is not as much as the U.S. fragmentation ones. So I am quite doubtful that a potato-masher would destroy a machine-gun pillbox, as shown in the movie. Plus, Stalingrad would not have gained its nickname "Street-fight Academy" if the defender's position is so easy to overthrow. In the ruins of the Stalingrad, it is impossible to imagine such a single machine-gun pillbox without supporting cross-fire from other directions. If it were that simple, the 6th Army would have captured the city long before the winter began. 2. In the middle of the movie, over the snow-covered steppe, Lieutenant Witzland's platoon is ordered to hold an area where the Russian wanted to break in with their tanks. The soldiers either used Panzerfaust to give the tank a direct hit, or waited in the foxhole until the tank rolled over, and attached the ad-hoc high-explosive to its rear-engine part to break it down. After that, the infantry soldiers attached to the tank or behind it were mowed down by German MP40 or MG42. As far as I know, the usual way of fighting with a mixed mechanized formation is to let the infantry soldiers come forward to scout the hidden enemy fire positions, to expose them and let them be licked up by the up-coming tanks. No, the tanks would never thrust forward by themselves. That way, they would be easy targets for Panzerfausts or Bazookas. The tanks would go all by themselves only in very large formations, say, a tank division or a tank army. In that case, the enemy would not have a chance to come behind the leading tanks and explode them from behind - anyone who tried to do this would be mowed down by the machine-gun in the following-up tanks. In short, the movie is successful in humanizing the German soldiers fighting in Stalingrad, but it made a big mistake in over-simplifying the battle scenes and under-estimating the Russian force too much, just the same errors commit by the Fuhrer and General Staff of Wehrmacht. The Russian would not have won the Battle of Stalingrad if they fought in the way described in the movie.

    A battalion of German soldiers from the Afrika Corps are spending some time at an Italian port during the summer of 1942. At that particular time their spirits were high as the German army was in the process of advancing victoriously into Russia. But all that was subject to change as their next assignment would be: Stalingrad. And they had no idea what was in store for them. At any rate, told from the German perspective, this film does a remarkable job of showing the hardships and tragedy these soldiers had to endure. Despite proving themselves in battle, their courage and discipline was being tested as much by the Russian winter as it was their Russian foes. And yet they continued on all the same. Now, while everybody knows how this battle eventually played out, this movie allows the viewer to gain a unique understanding of how it may have appeared through the eyes of the German soldier. Definitely worth a watch for those who can appreciate a film of this type.

    The battle of Stalingrad is beyond human imagination . It is an event in history that sends a shiver down the spine . Nazi Germany lost one quarter of its total strength on the Eastern front during this one battle . That's if you can even call it a battle , the number of forces involved meant it was more of campaign . And if the scale of the battle wasn't mind numbing enough it's the conditions and ferocity of the fighting that sticks in the mind . As a young schoolboy in the 1970s I vividly remember reading accounts " that every brick in every house in every street was bitterly fought over " . Even in the 21st century with the invasion of Iraq military experts have to emphasise that the capture of Baghdad wouldn't resemble Stalingrad in anyway . In short if you want to visualize war at its most cruel and brutal pick up a history book on Stalingrad . You almost feel sorry for the bad guys . I did say " almost" This is a slight problem with this cinematic account of the battle . STALINGRAD is a very well regarded German film and being a German film it feels the need to make a very clear line between good Germans who are portrayed as the ones who are conscripted in to the Wermacht who do all the fighting and dying in pursuit of Nazi ideals and bad Germans who blindly follow Nazi genocidal laws and never serve in the front line. Even the classic DAS BOOT suffers from this viewpoint . The only film that doesn't portray villains as Nazis is the Anglo German production CROSS OF IRON which has a Prussian aristocrat as the bad German . Would it not be a nice change that Germans murdering innocent people weren't necessarily goose stepping Nazis ? The truth is there were plenty of ordinary Wermacht units implicated in crimes against humanity on the Eastern front in the early 1940s For the majority of the film director Joseph Vilsmaier and screenwriter Jurgen Buscher tend to ignore politics and concentrate on making an anti-war film on a grand epic scale . They succeed too as a battalion of 400 men is quickly drained to a troop of 62 men carrying out full frontal assaults against desperate Soviet defenders . The film makers also make a very important point that Nazi Germany was a Christian nation and include a scene where a padre addresses a congregation emphasising that the Germans have God on their side where as the Bolsheviks are Godless atheists . This scene alone meant I could easily forgive the slight clich&eacute;s that creep in to the film Slight clich&eacute;s are easily forgiven . Unfortunately the more the film goes on the more clich&eacute;s come firing at the audience quicker than a Soviet counter-attack . What become even more unforgivable is the introduction of very contrived plotting as in " Someone must do something unlikely and even more unlikely a character who they already know appears to move the plot forward " A number of people who dislike this movie have pointed out the unlikely coincidences of characters who appeared in the film earlier appear and they're right . It's not enough to destroy the film but a battle on the scale of Stalingrad to have people bumping in to each other the way it happens here strains all credibility . Likewise the final third of the film is rather static where people have existentialist discussions and feels more like a German New Wave film from Rainer Werner Fassbinder In short STALINGRAD is a film I always wanted to see since it was released almost 20 years ago . It was worth the wait . It's a sweeping epic war film and is much praised for the battle sequences . It isn't flawless and unfortunately the flaws are very easy to spot and take issue with . As it stands CROSS OF IRON still remains the best film featuring the carnage and hell of fighting on the Eastern front

    Being a WW2 fan, i was a bit late to see this brilliant movie. Although there are not many movies which are shot in German POV, i find this movie full of uncompromising quality and workmanship. Its visually breathtaking, the battle scenes are brutal and chilling, even the conditions are so unbearable and yet greatly filmed. The Story line is unevenly told and lacks a neat narration. The actions scenes stop abruptly and lacking a final punch. At times, the movie drags on and on. The lead actors are good if not great. I feel that with the kind of brilliant setup the film crew had, they could have shot few more brutal action scenes instead of dragging the whole movie. If you really want to have a very few taste of German sympathy towards Communist counterparts, this is the flick and its aptly shown in bits and pieces.

    I would daresay this is a better war film than 'The Schindler's list'. We have seen many war films from the point of views of Russians, Jews, Poles etc. But this was my first world war 2 movie seen from a German soldier's point of view. The film starts when a battalion of German soldiers are ordered to go to Stalingrad. When they think about going to Stalingrad, they think of farms and greenery but when they reach Stalingrad, the truth is far different than the reality. The German soldiers think they could win Russia within a month, their very notion turns into disbelief as they enter Stalingrad, and see thousands of wounded German soldiers. Stalingrad war was indeed the biggest mistake of Germany, and it proved the beginning of the end for Germany, and resurrection of Russia. One thing I always wondered as a child, when a war is waged why there is no confusion, how always a particular army perfectly distinguishes its soldiers from the opponents'. In the very beginning, when Germans invade Stalingrad, we see a massive confusion within the battalion and a German soldier inadvertently kills his fellow soldier. As you may do research, you will find that there was a huge chaos during the world war 2 and such incidents occurred. One thing that the director wants to convey is that all the German soldiers were not blood grubbing monsters, even they were tired of killing other people, even they wanted to go home. But they had no options, if they didn't kill , they would have been killed by their superiors. This thing is evident when a young Russian boy is captured by the German army, and the soldiers who are protagonists in the movie are told to shoot the boy with dozens of other people. They are reluctant to shoot the boy, but their fascist superior warns them that if they didn't shoot those civilians, they would be next in queue. Stalingrad is an attempt by the director to earn some sympathy for the German soldiers, who were always seen as culprits, but this film shows they were victims too. I don't want to get into the war crimes that Germans committed in Russia and other nations, but when you view a film you have to see it impartially. At the very outset of the film, it is very much clear that you are not going to see a happy end as you see in Hollywood. This film makes 'Enemy at the gates' look a very cheap film which is far from reality, as it creates Rachel Weisz's character in the film. This film is not for the people who want to see war films just for the sake of explosions and killings of people. We see scenes in the film where a German soldier shares his bread with a civilian, and also in the end when the Hans Von Witzland refuses to rape a helpless Russian female soldier. This film tells us about the fate of the soldiers who were stuck there and knew what was coming to them. In fact, this movie tells us about the harsh reality of war and it tells that the war is always bad, and there is no winner in a war. This film doesn't show that Russians were bad despite being a German film, nor it shows that Germans were heroes, but still makes its point of earning sympathy for all the soldiers who lost their lives in the battle of Stalingrad.

    A disappointing movie. There are so many things wrong with Stal. that I could spend this review listing them. First, you have to be aware that certain words carry great promise, a promise that has to be fulfilled at the end or you'll disappoint your audience. Such is the case with "Stalingrad". Most of what's wrong with Stal. comes from the approach the filmmakers took. It's clear they thought that to add up another epic to their resume all they had to do was take inland the crew of Das Boot and put them in the cauldron of Stalingrad. Big mistake. There is an enormous difference of context and nature between both cases. If there was one single "clean" form of war during WWII, at least in the European theater, that was the naval war. There were no Nazi atrocities, no Waffen SS, no Shoah on Atlantic waters, so any German director is free to present his characters as regular sailors doing their duty. But that stops there. Once the action moves to the Eastern front, you cannot possibly keep presenting them under the same light. We do know Germans were the bad guys in the USSR and that's good enough for me, so dramatizations of their suffering and dying over there leave me quite indifferent. I wish German directors stopped presenting their WWII soldiers as just poor guys who got a raw deal, who suffered as much as their victims and who deserve our compassion. Funny thing, I don't see them as such poor saps in stock footage, while they were winning. Also don't talk to me, please, about "humanity in war". There is not such thing and that's the genius of films like Coppola's AN or Malick's TTRL: they show us war as it is, as a brutal, unmitigated, carnage where men lose their souls and become bloodthirsty dogs. In Stalingrad there was no other idea in the minds of all Soviet and German soldiers than to kill as many enemies as they could. Only because of that, Enemy At The Gates is far closer to the historic truth. But the "Das Boot "approach is not only wrong because it distorts the historic truth but also because it deprives the flick of an appropriate set up. The Italian beaches with its relaxing German soldiers--copycat of the Boot's partyrobs the opportunity for a tension creating intro, like the crossing of the Volga and the massacre of Russians in EATG. Those terrible scenes throw you headfirst into the battle, creating a sordid atmosphere which remains for the rest of the flick. You sit in awe for the length of it because you have been shaken to the bones with the raw brutality of it allKhrushchev selecting officers to be shot, Russian soldiers being mowed down like cattle--even more so when you know all, or most, really happened. EATG has been savaged by purists for distorting the historic truth, yet it has the merit of giving us an eloquent picture of what Stalingrad really was. The ever present darkness, the sordid surroundings, the atmosphere of death and decay, the stoic--yet without any illusion about their own survival--snipers. Battle scenes in Stal. instead seem to have been shot on home plate in Yankee Stadium; they are drowning in light, which ruins the atmosphere; its only in the gutter scene that we really get the feel. Also, EATG focuses mostly on a little known, yet fascinating, episode: the battle of the snipers, which makes for a far better packaged movie. Stal. instead wastes miles of film in inane bickering amongst the Germans, in futile conflicts between good and evil (the "evil German" is such a cartoon guy I doubt someone like that ever existed) and in skirmishes that appear staged, probably based on pictures of the real battle. Technically this is not a great flick movie either. The cinematography is standard and the directing so--so. I already mentioned the excess light. The pacing is stilted and the editing terrible. You are suddenly thrown in the midst of battle, not knowing how you got there--and as suddenly the action stops. Also, lack of continuity, some scenes just tacked there for no reason (the Russian woman with her baby). Subplots that keep popping up but lead nowhere (The Russian uncle and soldier for ex.). Stal. could have been better it focused instead on an overview of the whole battle and on Von Paulus' conflicted personality and behavior. The director took a gamble here and lost it; at least amongst those who think the Germans got what they deserved. With it settled, most of the empathy is gone. Schmaltzy scenes--let's save the boy from execution, or let's give them bread--don't ring true and instead only make things worse for the "humanity in war" theory. Even worse is the scene between the Russian girl and Witzland. Is she offended because he didn't rape her? Wow. Also, the battle in the snow is unrealistic. Had the Soviets fought like that they would have never won. (when attacked like that you spread out your tanks--not run them into entrenched infantry). But of course the Germans had to win, so they could last to the end of the movie. The best part, the only good one, is the ending, the unlikely trio treading through snow, going nowhere. Had the filmmakers started with that image, concept, and worked backwards this could have been a better flick In all, interesting enough to see once but not enough to remember it. 5.5/10.

    There was a time when I thought war films were just a bunch of random extras being killed. However when I looked at the ones that weren't American I found that War films can truly grip you and make you say "War is pointless". This is one of those "war is pointless" movies. Before anybody splits hairs in asking how the soldiers are portrayed then I will say something. This movie portrays them as soldiers going through a hellish war, just like the Finnish movie Talvisota (one I would HIGHLY recommend for fans of this movie). For other aspects of the film, it is well acted, the message came across loud and clear, nothing is Hollywood in this movie in terms of portrayal or anything else. I was expecting the ending because the producers were the same people who produced Das Boot For those people that want to see a fantastic war film about the front line should watch this.

    It's hard to deny this is an excellent film. Impeccable acting, direction and photography create a powerful depiction of war at its most miserable, futile and degrading. But I do think two mild criticisms need to be stated. First, a movie titled "Stalingrad" ought to present at least some vague overview of that historical battle. Aside from a few confusing references to the wider tactical situation, this move sticks to a worms-eye view. After a while, you even have to wonder whether the travails of this particular group of soldiers are at all typical of the huge German force involved at the time. The film works as drama, but if you call it simply "Stalingrad," I think you're promising a bit of historical context. Second, the pace is a tiny bit over-drawn. In the last third of the film, I reached an atrocity overload, where further horrors had progressively less impact. I began to disconnect from the characters, remaining only mildly curious as to what agonizingly tragic ways would be found to dispatch them. A stronger dramatic hook is needed, to pull us through the admitted hopelessness of this last segment. These are far from fatal flaws. It's more a question of balance. A bit more context, a slightly tighter narrative, and this could have been a masterpiece. As it is, I'd say it's a really excellent film, that does show - unforgettably - how war deadens the soul, even if it fails to kill the body. Still, I have to hope that other filmmakers will one day present a broader view of the battle of Stalingrad. There's still lots of historical ground that needs to be covered, if future generations are to understand the madness that created this nightmarish conflict.

    Stalingrad is not the best war film. At times, I found the sub-par acting by extras and use of stock sound effects really killed the depth of a scene. I also found that I couldn't keep a track of which characters were which, this may have been due to similar faces and language barriers creating trouble with indistinguishable accents. Between scenes, there would be such large gaps in time that you wouldn't be able to tell how a situation arose or what the situation was in some cases, making the story hard to follow. These factors limited my ability to feel the exhaustion and suffering of the characters, and left me slightly disengaged. The reason for my high mark, however, is attributed to the final scenes. The raw emotion coming from the few remaining actors is highly visible on this precious smaller scope, and the eventual plight of each character is played out in such devastating detail that I sat in silence in a dark room long after the credits had finished rolling and felt compelled after to even write some poetry. If you came to this film to see the struggle of a battle, you could do better, but stick around for the ending, it's very much worth it.

    For losers of a war or a battle, it is not customary to create something depicting their defeat, especially if this happened not so long time ago. E.g., Russians have had several defeats in the post WW II period - could you imagine them picturing this? With Stalingrad 1993, Germans have crudely shown the horrors and sufferings in one of the most severe battles in the WW II, without glorifying themselves and without scoffing at their enemy. On the other hand, Soviet Russia was no innocent victim, its treatment of own and neighboring people in the 1930ies was nasty and lethal as well, and Soviet (non-)activities were largely a reason why Hitler had courage to start this horrible war. As for the movie, the events and background seem realistic (probably shot in Finland), most of actors performing Russians speak decent Russian, and leading men are catchy to follow (primarily Dominique Horwitz as Obergefreiter Fritz Reiser, Thomas Kretschmann as Leutnant Hans Von Witzland, Jochen Nickel as Unteroffizier Manfred "Rollo" Rohleder). However, some of the scenes could have been shortened, and direct battle scenes comprise only a small part of the movie. The ending is predictable, although the scenes leading to it are well directed. It seems that the creators wanted to combine profound human aspect with concrete battle, but for this task, the movie was too short - a miniseries could have been more appropriate. Nevertheless, if you like war movies based on real events, Stalingrad is worth watching.

    The movie has a lot of good points, as have been shown in other review. However, the battle scenes in this movie are a little bit silly in my eyes: 1. At the beginning battle of the movie, the storm company (or battalion?) was tasked to overwhelm the defenders of the factory. The captain wanted to close the quarter quietly and launch the offensive without rousing the defenders. Yet, a rifle was fired unwillingly by an infantry who jumped in, which waked up the defenders and caused a lot of casualties in the attacking force. Later, the captain gave the soldier a hand-grenade to eliminate the machine-gun which is mowing down the German soldiers. That soldier just ran toward the machine-gun without much dodging movements, not even lowering his body. And he didn't get mowed down by the machine-gun. This contradicted the usual common sense. What's more, the German hand-grenade's advantage is its throwing distance, but the explosive in it is not as much as the U.S. fragmentation ones. So I am quite doubtful that a potato-masher would destroy a machine-gun pillbox, as shown in the movie. Plus, Stalingrad would not have gained its nickname "Street-fight Academy" if the defender's position is so easy to overthrow. In the ruins of the Stalingrad, it is impossible to imagine such a single machine-gun pillbox without supporting cross-fire from other directions. If it were that simple, the 6th Army would have captured the city long before the winter began. 2. In the middle of the movie, over the snow-covered steppe, Lieutenant Witzland's platoon is ordered to hold an area where the Russian wanted to break in with their tanks. The soldiers either used Panzerfaust to give the tank a direct hit, or waited in the foxhole until the tank rolled over, and attached the ad-hoc high-explosive to its rear-engine part to break it down. After that, the infantry soldiers attached to the tank or behind it were mowed down by German MP40 or MG42. As far as I know, the usual way of fighting with a mixed mechanized formation is to let the infantry soldiers come forward to scout the hidden enemy fire positions, to expose them and let them be licked up by the up-coming tanks. No, the tanks would never thrust forward by themselves. That way, they would be easy targets for Panzerfausts or Bazookas. The tanks would go all by themselves only in very large formations, say, a tank division or a tank army. In that case, the enemy would not have a chance to come behind the leading tanks and explode them from behind - anyone who tried to do this would be mowed down by the machine-gun in the following-up tanks. In short, the movie is successful in humanizing the German soldiers fighting in Stalingrad, but it made a big mistake in over-simplifying the battle scenes and under-estimating the Russian force too much, just the same errors commit by the Fuhrer and General Staff of Wehrmacht. The Russian would not have won the Battle of Stalingrad if they fought in the way described in the movie.

The actions scenes stop abruptly and lacking a final punch. At times, the movie drags on and on. The lead actors are good if not great. I feel that with the kind of brilliant setup the film crew had, they could have shot few more brutal action scenes instead of dragging the whole movie. If you really want to have a very few taste of German sympathy towards Communist counterparts, this is the flick and its aptly shown in bits and pieces.

    I would daresay this is a better war film than 'The Schindler's list'. We have seen many war films from the point of views of Russians, Jews, Poles etc. But this was my first world war 2 movie seen from a German soldier's point of view. The film starts when a battalion of German soldiers are ordered to go to Stalingrad. When they think about going to Stalingrad, they think of farms and greenery but when they reach Stalingrad, the truth is far different than the reality. The German soldiers think they could win Russia within a month, their very notion turns into disbelief as they enter Stalingrad, and see thousands of wounded German soldiers. Stalingrad war was indeed the biggest mistake of Germany, and it proved the beginning of the end for Germany, and resurrection of Russia. One thing I always wondered as a child, when a war is waged why there is no confusion, how always a particular army perfectly distinguishes its soldiers from the opponents'. In the very beginning, when Germans invade Stalingrad, we see a massive confusion within the battalion and a German soldier inadvertently kills his fellow soldier. As you may do research, you will find that there was a huge chaos during the world war 2 and such incidents occurred. One thing that the director wants to convey is that all the German soldiers were not blood grubbing monsters, even they were tired of killing other people, even they wanted to go home. But they had no options, if they didn't kill , they would have been killed by their superiors. This thing is evident when a young Russian boy is captured by the German army, and the soldiers who are protagonists in the movie are told to shoot the boy with dozens of other people. They are reluctant to shoot the boy, but their fascist superior warns them that if they didn't shoot those civilians, they would be next in queue. Stalingrad is an attempt by the director to earn some sympathy for the German soldiers, who were always seen as culprits, but this film shows they were victims too. I don't want to get into the war crimes that Germans committed in Russia and other nations, but when you view a film you have to see it impartially. At the very outset of the film, it is very much clear that you are not going to see a happy end as you see in Hollywood. This film makes 'Enemy at the gates' look a very cheap film which is far from reality, as it creates Rachel Weisz's character in the film. This film is not for the people who want to see war films just for the sake of explosions and killings of people. We see scenes in the film where a German soldier shares his bread with a civilian, and also in the end when the Hans Von Witzland refuses to rape a helpless Russian female soldier. This film tells us about the fate of the soldiers who were stuck there and knew what was coming to them. In fact, this movie tells us about the harsh reality of war and it tells that the war is always bad, and there is no winner in a war. This film doesn't show that Russians were bad despite being a German film, nor it shows that Germans were heroes, but still makes its point of earning sympathy for all the soldiers who lost their lives in the battle of Stalingrad.

    A disappointing movie. There are so many things wrong with Stal. that I could spend this review listing them. First, you have to be aware that certain words carry great promise, a promise that has to be fulfilled at the end or you'll disappoint your audience. Such is the case with "Stalingrad". Most of what's wrong with Stal. comes from the approach the filmmakers took. It's clear they thought that to add up another epic to their resume all they had to do was take inland the crew of Das Boot and put them in the cauldron of Stalingrad. Big mistake. There is an enormous difference of context and nature between both cases. If there was one single "clean" form of war during WWII, at least in the European theater, that was the naval war. There were no Nazi atrocities, no Waffen SS, no Shoah on Atlantic waters, so any German director is free to present his characters as regular sailors doing their duty. But that stops there. Once the action moves to the Eastern front, you cannot possibly keep presenting them under the same light. We do know Germans were the bad guys in the USSR and that's good enough for me, so dramatizations of their suffering and dying over there leave me quite indifferent. I wish German directors stopped presenting their WWII soldiers as just poor guys who got a raw deal, who suffered as much as their victims and who deserve our compassion. Funny thing, I don't see them as such poor saps in stock footage, while they were winning. Also don't talk to me, please, about "humanity in war". There is not such thing and that's the genius of films like Coppola's AN or Malick's TTRL: they show us war as it is, as a brutal, unmitigated, carnage where men lose their souls and become bloodthirsty dogs. In Stalingrad there was no other idea in the minds of all Soviet and German soldiers than to kill as many enemies as they could. Only because of that, Enemy At The Gates is far closer to the historic truth. But the "Das Boot "approach is not only wrong because it distorts the historic truth but also because it deprives the flick of an appropriate set up. The Italian beaches with its relaxing German soldiers--copycat of the Boot's partyrobs the opportunity for a tension creating intro, like the crossing of the Volga and the massacre of Russians in EATG. Those terrible scenes throw you headfirst into the battle, creating a sordid atmosphere which remains for the rest of the flick. You sit in awe for the length of it because you have been shaken to the bones with the raw brutality of it allKhrushchev selecting officers to be shot, Russian soldiers being mowed down like cattle--even more so when you know all, or most, really happened. EATG has been savaged by purists for distorting the historic truth, yet it has the merit of giving us an eloquent picture of what Stalingrad really was. The ever present darkness, the sordid surroundings, the atmosphere of death and decay, the stoic--yet without any illusion about their own survival--snipers. Battle scenes in Stal. instead seem to have been shot on home plate in Yankee Stadium; they are drowning in light, which ruins the atmosphere; its only in the gutter scene that we really get the feel. Also, EATG focuses mostly on a little known, yet fascinating, episode: the battle of the snipers, which makes for a far better packaged movie. Stal. instead wastes miles of film in inane bickering amongst the Germans, in futile conflicts between good and evil (the "evil German" is such a cartoon guy I doubt someone like that ever existed) and in skirmishes that appear staged, probably based on pictures of the real battle. Technically this is not a great flick movie either. The cinematography is standard and the directing so--so. I already mentioned the excess light. The pacing is stilted and the editing terrible. You are suddenly thrown in the midst of battle, not knowing how you got there--and as suddenly the action stops. Also, lack of continuity, some scenes just tacked there for no reason (the Russian woman with her baby). Subplots that keep popping up but lead nowhere (The Russian uncle and soldier for ex.). Stal. could have been better it focused instead on an overview of the whole battle and on Von Paulus' conflicted personality and behavior. The director took a gamble here and lost it; at least amongst those who think the Germans got what they deserved. With it settled, most of the empathy is gone. Schmaltzy scenes--let's save the boy from execution, or let's give them bread--don't ring true and instead only make things worse for the "humanity in war" theory. Even worse is the scene between the Russian girl and Witzland. Is she offended because he didn't rape her? Wow. Also, the battle in the snow is unrealistic. Had the Soviets fought like that they would have never won. (when attacked like that you spread out your tanks--not run them into entrenched infantry). But of course the Germans had to win, so they could last to the end of the movie. The best part, the only good one, is the ending, the unlikely trio treading through snow, going nowhere. Had the filmmakers started with that image, concept, and worked backwards this could have been a better flick In all, interesting enough to see once but not enough to remember it. 5.5/10.

    There was a time when I thought war films were just a bunch of random extras being killed. However when I looked at the ones that weren't American I found that War films can truly grip you and make you say "War is pointless". This is one of those "war is pointless" movies. Before anybody splits hairs in asking how the soldiers are portrayed then I will say something. This movie portrays them as soldiers going through a hellish war, just like the Finnish movie Talvisota (one I would HIGHLY recommend for fans of this movie). For other aspects of the film, it is well acted, the message came across loud and clear, nothing is Hollywood in this movie in terms of portrayal or anything else. I was expecting the ending because the producers were the same people who produced Das Boot For those people that want to see a fantastic war film about the front line should watch this.

    It's hard to deny this is an excellent film. Impeccable acting, direction and photography create a powerful depiction of war at its most miserable, futile and degrading. But I do think two mild criticisms need to be stated. First, a movie titled "Stalingrad" ought to present at least some vague overview of that historical battle. Aside from a few confusing references to the wider tactical situation, this move sticks to a worms-eye view. After a while, you even have to wonder whether the travails of this particular group of soldiers are at all typical of the huge German force involved at the time. The film works as drama, but if you call it simply "Stalingrad," I think you're promising a bit of historical context. Second, the pace is a tiny bit over-drawn. In the last third of the film, I reached an atrocity overload, where further horrors had progressively less impact. I began to disconnect from the characters, remaining only mildly curious as to what agonizingly tragic ways would be found to dispatch them. A stronger dramatic hook is needed, to pull us through the admitted hopelessness of this last segment. These are far from fatal flaws. It's more a question of balance. A bit more context, a slightly tighter narrative, and this could have been a masterpiece. As it is, I'd say it's a really excellent film, that does show - unforgettably - how war deadens the soul, even if it fails to kill the body. Still, I have to hope that other filmmakers will one day present a broader view of the battle of Stalingrad. There's still lots of historical ground that needs to be covered, if future generations are to understand the madness that created this nightmarish conflict.

    Stalingrad is not the best war film. At times, I found the sub-par acting by extras and use of stock sound effects really killed the depth of a scene. I also found that I couldn't keep a track of which characters were which, this may have been due to similar faces and language barriers creating trouble with indistinguishable accents. Between scenes, there would be such large gaps in time that you wouldn't be able to tell how a situation arose or what the situation was in some cases, making the story hard to follow. These factors limited my ability to feel the exhaustion and suffering of the characters, and left me slightly disengaged. The reason for my high mark, however, is attributed to the final scenes. The raw emotion coming from the few remaining actors is highly visible on this precious smaller scope, and the eventual plight of each character is played out in such devastating detail that I sat in silence in a dark room long after the credits had finished rolling and felt compelled after to even write some poetry. If you came to this film to see the struggle of a battle, you could do better, but stick around for the ending, it's very much worth it.

    For losers of a war or a battle, it is not customary to create something depicting their defeat, especially if this happened not so long time ago. E.g., Russians have had several defeats in the post WW II period - could you imagine them picturing this? With Stalingrad 1993, Germans have crudely shown the horrors and sufferings in one of the most severe battles in the WW II, without glorifying themselves and without scoffing at their enemy. On the other hand, Soviet Russia was no innocent victim, its treatment of own and neighboring people in the 1930ies was nasty and lethal as well, and Soviet (non-)activities were largely a reason why Hitler had courage to start this horrible war. As for the movie, the events and background seem realistic (probably shot in Finland), most of actors performing Russians speak decent Russian, and leading men are catchy to follow (primarily Dominique Horwitz as Obergefreiter Fritz Reiser, Thomas Kretschmann as Leutnant Hans Von Witzland, Jochen Nickel as Unteroffizier Manfred "Rollo" Rohleder). However, some of the scenes could have been shortened, and direct battle scenes comprise only a small part of the movie. The ending is predictable, although the scenes leading to it are well directed. It seems that the creators wanted to combine profound human aspect with concrete battle, but for this task, the movie was too short - a miniseries could have been more appropriate. Nevertheless, if you like war movies based on real events, Stalingrad is worth watching.

    The movie has a lot of good points, as have been shown in other review. However, the battle scenes in this movie are a little bit silly in my eyes: 1. At the beginning battle of the movie, the storm company (or battalion?) was tasked to overwhelm the defenders of the factory. The captain wanted to close the quarter quietly and launch the offensive without rousing the defenders. Yet, a rifle was fired unwillingly by an infantry who jumped in, which waked up the defenders and caused a lot of casualties in the attacking force. Later, the captain gave the soldier a hand-grenade to eliminate the machine-gun which is mowing down the German soldiers. That soldier just ran toward the machine-gun without much dodging movements, not even lowering his body. And he didn't get mowed down by the machine-gun. This contradicted the usual common sense. What's more, the German hand-grenade's advantage is its throwing distance, but the explosive in it is not as much as the U.S. fragmentation ones. So I am quite doubtful that a potato-masher would destroy a machine-gun pillbox, as shown in the movie. Plus, Stalingrad would not have gained its nickname "Street-fight Academy" if the defender's position is so easy to overthrow. In the ruins of the Stalingrad, it is impossible to imagine such a single machine-gun pillbox without supporting cross-fire from other directions. If it were that simple, the 6th Army would have captured the city long before the winter began. 2. In the middle of the movie, over the snow-covered steppe, Lieutenant Witzland's platoon is ordered to hold an area where the Russian wanted to break in with their tanks. The soldiers either used Panzerfaust to give the tank a direct hit, or waited in the foxhole until the tank rolled over, and attached the ad-hoc high-explosive to its rear-engine part to break it down. After that, the infantry soldiers attached to the tank or behind it were mowed down by German MP40 or MG42. As far as I know, the usual way of fighting with a mixed mechanized formation is to let the infantry soldiers come forward to scout the hidden enemy fire positions, to expose them and let them be licked up by the up-coming tanks. No, the tanks would never thrust forward by themselves. That way, they would be easy targets for Panzerfausts or Bazookas. The tanks would go all by themselves only in very large formations, say, a tank division or a tank army. In that case, the enemy would not have a chance to come behind the leading tanks and explode them from behind - anyone who tried to do this would be mowed down by the machine-gun in the following-up tanks. In short, the movie is successful in humanizing the German soldiers fighting in Stalingrad, but it made a big mistake in over-simplifying the battle scenes and under-estimating the Russian force too much, just the same errors commit by the Fuhrer and General Staff of Wehrmacht. The Russian would not have won the Battle of Stalingrad if they fought in the way described in the movie.

    A battalion of German soldiers from the Afrika Corps are spending some time at an Italian port during the summer of 1942. At that particular time their spirits were high as the German army was in the process of advancing victoriously into Russia. But all that was subject to change as their next assignment would be: Stalingrad. And they had no idea what was in store for them. At any rate, told from the German perspective, this film does a remarkable job of showing the hardships and tragedy these soldiers had to endure. Despite proving themselves in battle, their courage and discipline was being tested as much by the Russian winter as it was their Russian foes. And yet they continued on all the same. Now, while everybody knows how this battle eventually played out, this movie allows the viewer to gain a unique understanding of how it may have appeared through the eyes of the German soldier. Definitely worth a watch for those who can appreciate a film of this type.

    The battle of Stalingrad is beyond human imagination . It is an event in history that sends a shiver down the spine . Nazi Germany lost one quarter of its total strength on the Eastern front during this one battle . That's if you can even call it a battle , the number of forces involved meant it was more of campaign . And if the scale of the battle wasn't mind numbing enough it's the conditions and ferocity of the fighting that sticks in the mind . As a young schoolboy in the 1970s I vividly remember reading accounts " that every brick in every house in every street was bitterly fought over " . Even in the 21st century with the invasion of Iraq military experts have to emphasise that the capture of Baghdad wouldn't resemble Stalingrad in anyway . In short if you want to visualize war at its most cruel and brutal pick up a history book on Stalingrad . You almost feel sorry for the bad guys . I did say " almost" This is a slight problem with this cinematic account of the battle . STALINGRAD is a very well regarded German film and being a German film it feels the need to make a very clear line between good Germans who are portrayed as the ones who are conscripted in to the Wermacht who do all the fighting and dying in pursuit of Nazi ideals and bad Germans who blindly follow Nazi genocidal laws and never serve in the front line. Even the classic DAS BOOT suffers from this viewpoint . The only film that doesn't portray villains as Nazis is the Anglo German production CROSS OF IRON which has a Prussian aristocrat as the bad German . Would it not be a nice change that Germans murdering innocent people weren't necessarily goose stepping Nazis ? The truth is there were plenty of ordinary Wermacht units implicated in crimes against humanity on the Eastern front in the early 1940s For the majority of the film director Joseph Vilsmaier and screenwriter Jurgen Buscher tend to ignore politics and concentrate on making an anti-war film on a grand epic scale . They succeed too as a battalion of 400 men is quickly drained to a troop of 62 men carrying out full frontal assaults against desperate Soviet defenders . The film makers also make a very important point that Nazi Germany was a Christian nation and include a scene where a padre addresses a congregation emphasising that the Germans have God on their side where as the Bolsheviks are Godless atheists . This scene alone meant I could easily forgive the slight clich&eacute;s that creep in to the film Slight clich&eacute;s are easily forgiven . Unfortunately the more the film goes on the more clich&eacute;s come firing at the audience quicker than a Soviet counter-attack . What become even more unforgivable is the introduction of very contrived plotting as in " Someone must do something unlikely and even more unlikely a character who they already know appears to move the plot forward " A number of people who dislike this movie have pointed out the unlikely coincidences of characters who appeared in the film earlier appear and they're right . It's not enough to destroy the film but a battle on the scale of Stalingrad to have people bumping in to each other the way it happens here strains all credibility . Likewise the final third of the film is rather static where people have existentialist discussions and feels more like a German New Wave film from Rainer Werner Fassbinder In short STALINGRAD is a film I always wanted to see since it was released almost 20 years ago . It was worth the wait . It's a sweeping epic war film and is much praised for the battle sequences . It isn't flawless and unfortunately the flaws are very easy to spot and take issue with . As it stands CROSS OF IRON still remains the best film featuring the carnage and hell of fighting on the Eastern front

Stal. could have been better it focused instead on an overview of the whole battle and on Von Paulus' conflicted personality and behavior. The director took a gamble here and lost it; at least amongst those who think the Germans got what they deserved. With it settled, most of the empathy is gone. Schmaltzy scenes--let's save the boy from execution, or let's give them bread--don't ring true and instead only make things worse for the "humanity in war" theory. Even worse is the scene between the Russian girl and Witzland. Is she offended because he didn't rape her? Wow. Also, the battle in the snow is unrealistic. Had the Soviets fought like that they would have never won. (when attacked like that you spread out your tanks--not run them into entrenched infantry). But of course the Germans had to win, so they could last to the end of the movie. The best part, the only good one, is the ending, the unlikely trio treading through snow, going nowhere. Had the filmmakers started with that image, concept, and worked backwards this could have been a better flick In all, interesting enough to see once but not enough to remember it. 5.5/10.

    There was a time when I thought war films were just a bunch of random extras being killed. However when I looked at the ones that weren't American I found that War films can truly grip you and make you say "War is pointless". This is one of those "war is pointless" movies. Before anybody splits hairs in asking how the soldiers are portrayed then I will say something. This movie portrays them as soldiers going through a hellish war, just like the Finnish movie Talvisota (one I would HIGHLY recommend for fans of this movie). For other aspects of the film, it is well acted, the message came across loud and clear, nothing is Hollywood in this movie in terms of portrayal or anything else. I was expecting the ending because the producers were the same people who produced Das Boot For those people that want to see a fantastic war film about the front line should watch this.

    It's hard to deny this is an excellent film. Impeccable acting, direction and photography create a powerful depiction of war at its most miserable, futile and degrading. But I do think two mild criticisms need to be stated. First, a movie titled "Stalingrad" ought to present at least some vague overview of that historical battle. Aside from a few confusing references to the wider tactical situation, this move sticks to a worms-eye view. After a while, you even have to wonder whether the travails of this particular group of soldiers are at all typical of the huge German force involved at the time. The film works as drama, but if you call it simply "Stalingrad," I think you're promising a bit of historical context. Second, the pace is a tiny bit over-drawn. In the last third of the film, I reached an atrocity overload, where further horrors had progressively less impact. I began to disconnect from the characters, remaining only mildly curious as to what agonizingly tragic ways would be found to dispatch them. A stronger dramatic hook is needed, to pull us through the admitted hopelessness of this last segment. These are far from fatal flaws. It's more a question of balance. A bit more context, a slightly tighter narrative, and this could have been a masterpiece. As it is, I'd say it's a really excellent film, that does show - unforgettably - how war deadens the soul, even if it fails to kill the body. Still, I have to hope that other filmmakers will one day present a broader view of the battle of Stalingrad. There's still lots of historical ground that needs to be covered, if future generations are to understand the madness that created this nightmarish conflict.

    Stalingrad is not the best war film. At times, I found the sub-par acting by extras and use of stock sound effects really killed the depth of a scene. I also found that I couldn't keep a track of which characters were which, this may have been due to similar faces and language barriers creating trouble with indistinguishable accents. Between scenes, there would be such large gaps in time that you wouldn't be able to tell how a situation arose or what the situation was in some cases, making the story hard to follow. These factors limited my ability to feel the exhaustion and suffering of the characters, and left me slightly disengaged. The reason for my high mark, however, is attributed to the final scenes. The raw emotion coming from the few remaining actors is highly visible on this precious smaller scope, and the eventual plight of each character is played out in such devastating detail that I sat in silence in a dark room long after the credits had finished rolling and felt compelled after to even write some poetry. If you came to this film to see the struggle of a battle, you could do better, but stick around for the ending, it's very much worth it.

    For losers of a war or a battle, it is not customary to create something depicting their defeat, especially if this happened not so long time ago. E.g., Russians have had several defeats in the post WW II period - could you imagine them picturing this? With Stalingrad 1993, Germans have crudely shown the horrors and sufferings in one of the most severe battles in the WW II, without glorifying themselves and without scoffing at their enemy. On the other hand, Soviet Russia was no innocent victim, its treatment of own and neighboring people in the 1930ies was nasty and lethal as well, and Soviet (non-)activities were largely a reason why Hitler had courage to start this horrible war. As for the movie, the events and background seem realistic (probably shot in Finland), most of actors performing Russians speak decent Russian, and leading men are catchy to follow (primarily Dominique Horwitz as Obergefreiter Fritz Reiser, Thomas Kretschmann as Leutnant Hans Von Witzland, Jochen Nickel as Unteroffizier Manfred "Rollo" Rohleder). However, some of the scenes could have been shortened, and direct battle scenes comprise only a small part of the movie. The ending is predictable, although the scenes leading to it are well directed. It seems that the creators wanted to combine profound human aspect with concrete battle, but for this task, the movie was too short - a miniseries could have been more appropriate. Nevertheless, if you like war movies based on real events, Stalingrad is worth watching.

    The movie has a lot of good points, as have been shown in other review. However, the battle scenes in this movie are a little bit silly in my eyes: 1. At the beginning battle of the movie, the storm company (or battalion?) was tasked to overwhelm the defenders of the factory. The captain wanted to close the quarter quietly and launch the offensive without rousing the defenders. Yet, a rifle was fired unwillingly by an infantry who jumped in, which waked up the defenders and caused a lot of casualties in the attacking force. Later, the captain gave the soldier a hand-grenade to eliminate the machine-gun which is mowing down the German soldiers. That soldier just ran toward the machine-gun without much dodging movements, not even lowering his body. And he didn't get mowed down by the machine-gun. This contradicted the usual common sense. What's more, the German hand-grenade's advantage is its throwing distance, but the explosive in it is not as much as the U.S. fragmentation ones. So I am quite doubtful that a potato-masher would destroy a machine-gun pillbox, as shown in the movie. Plus, Stalingrad would not have gained its nickname "Street-fight Academy" if the defender's position is so easy to overthrow. In the ruins of the Stalingrad, it is impossible to imagine such a single machine-gun pillbox without supporting cross-fire from other directions. If it were that simple, the 6th Army would have captured the city long before the winter began. 2. In the middle of the movie, over the snow-covered steppe, Lieutenant Witzland's platoon is ordered to hold an area where the Russian wanted to break in with their tanks. The soldiers either used Panzerfaust to give the tank a direct hit, or waited in the foxhole until the tank rolled over, and attached the ad-hoc high-explosive to its rear-engine part to break it down. After that, the infantry soldiers attached to the tank or behind it were mowed down by German MP40 or MG42. As far as I know, the usual way of fighting with a mixed mechanized formation is to let the infantry soldiers come forward to scout the hidden enemy fire positions, to expose them and let them be licked up by the up-coming tanks. No, the tanks would never thrust forward by themselves. That way, they would be easy targets for Panzerfausts or Bazookas. The tanks would go all by themselves only in very large formations, say, a tank division or a tank army. In that case, the enemy would not have a chance to come behind the leading tanks and explode them from behind - anyone who tried to do this would be mowed down by the machine-gun in the following-up tanks. In short, the movie is successful in humanizing the German soldiers fighting in Stalingrad, but it made a big mistake in over-simplifying the battle scenes and under-estimating the Russian force too much, just the same errors commit by the Fuhrer and General Staff of Wehrmacht. The Russian would not have won the Battle of Stalingrad if they fought in the way described in the movie.

    A battalion of German soldiers from the Afrika Corps are spending some time at an Italian port during the summer of 1942. At that particular time their spirits were high as the German army was in the process of advancing victoriously into Russia. But all that was subject to change as their next assignment would be: Stalingrad. And they had no idea what was in store for them. At any rate, told from the German perspective, this film does a remarkable job of showing the hardships and tragedy these soldiers had to endure. Despite proving themselves in battle, their courage and discipline was being tested as much by the Russian winter as it was their Russian foes. And yet they continued on all the same. Now, while everybody knows how this battle eventually played out, this movie allows the viewer to gain a unique understanding of how it may have appeared through the eyes of the German soldier. Definitely worth a watch for those who can appreciate a film of this type.

    The battle of Stalingrad is beyond human imagination . It is an event in history that sends a shiver down the spine . Nazi Germany lost one quarter of its total strength on the Eastern front during this one battle . That's if you can even call it a battle , the number of forces involved meant it was more of campaign . And if the scale of the battle wasn't mind numbing enough it's the conditions and ferocity of the fighting that sticks in the mind . As a young schoolboy in the 1970s I vividly remember reading accounts " that every brick in every house in every street was bitterly fought over " . Even in the 21st century with the invasion of Iraq military experts have to emphasise that the capture of Baghdad wouldn't resemble Stalingrad in anyway . In short if you want to visualize war at its most cruel and brutal pick up a history book on Stalingrad . You almost feel sorry for the bad guys . I did say " almost" This is a slight problem with this cinematic account of the battle . STALINGRAD is a very well regarded German film and being a German film it feels the need to make a very clear line between good Germans who are portrayed as the ones who are conscripted in to the Wermacht who do all the fighting and dying in pursuit of Nazi ideals and bad Germans who blindly follow Nazi genocidal laws and never serve in the front line. Even the classic DAS BOOT suffers from this viewpoint . The only film that doesn't portray villains as Nazis is the Anglo German production CROSS OF IRON which has a Prussian aristocrat as the bad German . Would it not be a nice change that Germans murdering innocent people weren't necessarily goose stepping Nazis ? The truth is there were plenty of ordinary Wermacht units implicated in crimes against humanity on the Eastern front in the early 1940s For the majority of the film director Joseph Vilsmaier and screenwriter Jurgen Buscher tend to ignore politics and concentrate on making an anti-war film on a grand epic scale . They succeed too as a battalion of 400 men is quickly drained to a troop of 62 men carrying out full frontal assaults against desperate Soviet defenders . The film makers also make a very important point that Nazi Germany was a Christian nation and include a scene where a padre addresses a congregation emphasising that the Germans have God on their side where as the Bolsheviks are Godless atheists . This scene alone meant I could easily forgive the slight clich&eacute;s that creep in to the film Slight clich&eacute;s are easily forgiven . Unfortunately the more the film goes on the more clich&eacute;s come firing at the audience quicker than a Soviet counter-attack . What become even more unforgivable is the introduction of very contrived plotting as in " Someone must do something unlikely and even more unlikely a character who they already know appears to move the plot forward " A number of people who dislike this movie have pointed out the unlikely coincidences of characters who appeared in the film earlier appear and they're right . It's not enough to destroy the film but a battle on the scale of Stalingrad to have people bumping in to each other the way it happens here strains all credibility . Likewise the final third of the film is rather static where people have existentialist discussions and feels more like a German New Wave film from Rainer Werner Fassbinder In short STALINGRAD is a film I always wanted to see since it was released almost 20 years ago . It was worth the wait . It's a sweeping epic war film and is much praised for the battle sequences . It isn't flawless and unfortunately the flaws are very easy to spot and take issue with . As it stands CROSS OF IRON still remains the best film featuring the carnage and hell of fighting on the Eastern front

    Being a WW2 fan, i was a bit late to see this brilliant movie. Although there are not many movies which are shot in German POV, i find this movie full of uncompromising quality and workmanship. Its visually breathtaking, the battle scenes are brutal and chilling, even the conditions are so unbearable and yet greatly filmed. The Story line is unevenly told and lacks a neat narration. The actions scenes stop abruptly and lacking a final punch. At times, the movie drags on and on. The lead actors are good if not great. I feel that with the kind of brilliant setup the film crew had, they could have shot few more brutal action scenes instead of dragging the whole movie. If you really want to have a very few taste of German sympathy towards Communist counterparts, this is the flick and its aptly shown in bits and pieces.

    I would daresay this is a better war film than 'The Schindler's list'. We have seen many war films from the point of views of Russians, Jews, Poles etc. But this was my first world war 2 movie seen from a German soldier's point of view. The film starts when a battalion of German soldiers are ordered to go to Stalingrad. When they think about going to Stalingrad, they think of farms and greenery but when they reach Stalingrad, the truth is far different than the reality. The German soldiers think they could win Russia within a month, their very notion turns into disbelief as they enter Stalingrad, and see thousands of wounded German soldiers. Stalingrad war was indeed the biggest mistake of Germany, and it proved the beginning of the end for Germany, and resurrection of Russia. One thing I always wondered as a child, when a war is waged why there is no confusion, how always a particular army perfectly distinguishes its soldiers from the opponents'. In the very beginning, when Germans invade Stalingrad, we see a massive confusion within the battalion and a German soldier inadvertently kills his fellow soldier. As you may do research, you will find that there was a huge chaos during the world war 2 and such incidents occurred. One thing that the director wants to convey is that all the German soldiers were not blood grubbing monsters, even they were tired of killing other people, even they wanted to go home. But they had no options, if they didn't kill , they would have been killed by their superiors. This thing is evident when a young Russian boy is captured by the German army, and the soldiers who are protagonists in the movie are told to shoot the boy with dozens of other people. They are reluctant to shoot the boy, but their fascist superior warns them that if they didn't shoot those civilians, they would be next in queue. Stalingrad is an attempt by the director to earn some sympathy for the German soldiers, who were always seen as culprits, but this film shows they were victims too. I don't want to get into the war crimes that Germans committed in Russia and other nations, but when you view a film you have to see it impartially. At the very outset of the film, it is very much clear that you are not going to see a happy end as you see in Hollywood. This film makes 'Enemy at the gates' look a very cheap film which is far from reality, as it creates Rachel Weisz's character in the film. This film is not for the people who want to see war films just for the sake of explosions and killings of people. We see scenes in the film where a German soldier shares his bread with a civilian, and also in the end when the Hans Von Witzland refuses to rape a helpless Russian female soldier. This film tells us about the fate of the soldiers who were stuck there and knew what was coming to them. In fact, this movie tells us about the harsh reality of war and it tells that the war is always bad, and there is no winner in a war. This film doesn't show that Russians were bad despite being a German film, nor it shows that Germans were heroes, but still makes its point of earning sympathy for all the soldiers who lost their lives in the battle of Stalingrad.

    A disappointing movie. There are so many things wrong with Stal. that I could spend this review listing them. First, you have to be aware that certain words carry great promise, a promise that has to be fulfilled at the end or you'll disappoint your audience. Such is the case with "Stalingrad". Most of what's wrong with Stal. comes from the approach the filmmakers took. It's clear they thought that to add up another epic to their resume all they had to do was take inland the crew of Das Boot and put them in the cauldron of Stalingrad. Big mistake. There is an enormous difference of context and nature between both cases. If there was one single "clean" form of war during WWII, at least in the European theater, that was the naval war. There were no Nazi atrocities, no Waffen SS, no Shoah on Atlantic waters, so any German director is free to present his characters as regular sailors doing their duty. But that stops there. Once the action moves to the Eastern front, you cannot possibly keep presenting them under the same light. We do know Germans were the bad guys in the USSR and that's good enough for me, so dramatizations of their suffering and dying over there leave me quite indifferent. I wish German directors stopped presenting their WWII soldiers as just poor guys who got a raw deal, who suffered as much as their victims and who deserve our compassion. Funny thing, I don't see them as such poor saps in stock footage, while they were winning. Also don't talk to me, please, about "humanity in war". There is not such thing and that's the genius of films like Coppola's AN or Malick's TTRL: they show us war as it is, as a brutal, unmitigated, carnage where men lose their souls and become bloodthirsty dogs. In Stalingrad there was no other idea in the minds of all Soviet and German soldiers than to kill as many enemies as they could. Only because of that, Enemy At The Gates is far closer to the historic truth. But the "Das Boot "approach is not only wrong because it distorts the historic truth but also because it deprives the flick of an appropriate set up. The Italian beaches with its relaxing German soldiers--copycat of the Boot's partyrobs the opportunity for a tension creating intro, like the crossing of the Volga and the massacre of Russians in EATG. Those terrible scenes throw you headfirst into the battle, creating a sordid atmosphere which remains for the rest of the flick. You sit in awe for the length of it because you have been shaken to the bones with the raw brutality of it allKhrushchev selecting officers to be shot, Russian soldiers being mowed down like cattle--even more so when you know all, or most, really happened. EATG has been savaged by purists for distorting the historic truth, yet it has the merit of giving us an eloquent picture of what Stalingrad really was. The ever present darkness, the sordid surroundings, the atmosphere of death and decay, the stoic--yet without any illusion about their own survival--snipers. Battle scenes in Stal. instead seem to have been shot on home plate in Yankee Stadium; they are drowning in light, which ruins the atmosphere; its only in the gutter scene that we really get the feel. Also, EATG focuses mostly on a little known, yet fascinating, episode: the battle of the snipers, which makes for a far better packaged movie. Stal. instead wastes miles of film in inane bickering amongst the Germans, in futile conflicts between good and evil (the "evil German" is such a cartoon guy I doubt someone like that ever existed) and in skirmishes that appear staged, probably based on pictures of the real battle. Technically this is not a great flick movie either. The cinematography is standard and the directing so--so. I already mentioned the excess light. The pacing is stilted and the editing terrible. You are suddenly thrown in the midst of battle, not knowing how you got there--and as suddenly the action stops. Also, lack of continuity, some scenes just tacked there for no reason (the Russian woman with her baby). Subplots that keep popping up but lead nowhere (The Russian uncle and soldier for ex.). Stal. could have been better it focused instead on an overview of the whole battle and on Von Paulus' conflicted personality and behavior. The director took a gamble here and lost it; at least amongst those who think the Germans got what they deserved. With it settled, most of the empathy is gone. Schmaltzy scenes--let's save the boy from execution, or let's give them bread--don't ring true and instead only make things worse for the "humanity in war" theory. Even worse is the scene between the Russian girl and Witzland. Is she offended because he didn't rape her? Wow. Also, the battle in the snow is unrealistic. Had the Soviets fought like that they would have never won. (when attacked like that you spread out your tanks--not run them into entrenched infantry). But of course the Germans had to win, so they could last to the end of the movie. The best part, the only good one, is the ending, the unlikely trio treading through snow, going nowhere. Had the filmmakers started with that image, concept, and worked backwards this could have been a better flick In all, interesting enough to see once but not enough to remember it. 5.5/10.

At the beginning battle of the movie, the storm company (or battalion?) was tasked to overwhelm the defenders of the factory. The captain wanted to close the quarter quietly and launch the offensive without rousing the defenders. Yet, a rifle was fired unwillingly by an infantry who jumped in, which waked up the defenders and caused a lot of casualties in the attacking force. Later, the captain gave the soldier a hand-grenade to eliminate the machine-gun which is mowing down the German soldiers. That soldier just ran toward the machine-gun without much dodging movements, not even lowering his body. And he didn't get mowed down by the machine-gun. This contradicted the usual common sense. What's more, the German hand-grenade's advantage is its throwing distance, but the explosive in it is not as much as the U.S. fragmentation ones. So I am quite doubtful that a potato-masher would destroy a machine-gun pillbox, as shown in the movie. Plus, Stalingrad would not have gained its nickname "Street-fight Academy" if the defender's position is so easy to overthrow. In the ruins of the Stalingrad, it is impossible to imagine such a single machine-gun pillbox without supporting cross-fire from other directions. If it were that simple, the 6th Army would have captured the city long before the winter began. 2. In the middle of the movie, over the snow-covered steppe, Lieutenant Witzland's platoon is ordered to hold an area where the Russian wanted to break in with their tanks. The soldiers either used Panzerfaust to give the tank a direct hit, or waited in the foxhole until the tank rolled over, and attached the ad-hoc high-explosive to its rear-engine part to break it down. After that, the infantry soldiers attached to the tank or behind it were mowed down by German MP40 or MG42. As far as I know, the usual way of fighting with a mixed mechanized formation is to let the infantry soldiers come forward to scout the hidden enemy fire positions, to expose them and let them be licked up by the up-coming tanks. No, the tanks would never thrust forward by themselves. That way, they would be easy targets for Panzerfausts or Bazookas. The tanks would go all by themselves only in very large formations, say, a tank division or a tank army. In that case, the enemy would not have a chance to come behind the leading tanks and explode them from behind - anyone who tried to do this would be mowed down by the machine-gun in the following-up tanks. In short, the movie is successful in humanizing the German soldiers fighting in Stalingrad, but it made a big mistake in over-simplifying the battle scenes and under-estimating the Russian force too much, just the same errors commit by the Fuhrer and General Staff of Wehrmacht. The Russian would not have won the Battle of Stalingrad if they fought in the way described in the movie.

    A battalion of German soldiers from the Afrika Corps are spending some time at an Italian port during the summer of 1942. At that particular time their spirits were high as the German army was in the process of advancing victoriously into Russia. But all that was subject to change as their next assignment would be: Stalingrad. And they had no idea what was in store for them. At any rate, told from the German perspective, this film does a remarkable job of showing the hardships and tragedy these soldiers had to endure. Despite proving themselves in battle, their courage and discipline was being tested as much by the Russian winter as it was their Russian foes. And yet they continued on all the same. Now, while everybody knows how this battle eventually played out, this movie allows the viewer to gain a unique understanding of how it may have appeared through the eyes of the German soldier. Definitely worth a watch for those who can appreciate a film of this type.

    The battle of Stalingrad is beyond human imagination . It is an event in history that sends a shiver down the spine . Nazi Germany lost one quarter of its total strength on the Eastern front during this one battle . That's if you can even call it a battle , the number of forces involved meant it was more of campaign . And if the scale of the battle wasn't mind numbing enough it's the conditions and ferocity of the fighting that sticks in the mind . As a young schoolboy in the 1970s I vividly remember reading accounts " that every brick in every house in every street was bitterly fought over " . Even in the 21st century with the invasion of Iraq military experts have to emphasise that the capture of Baghdad wouldn't resemble Stalingrad in anyway . In short if you want to visualize war at its most cruel and brutal pick up a history book on Stalingrad . You almost feel sorry for the bad guys . I did say " almost" This is a slight problem with this cinematic account of the battle . STALINGRAD is a very well regarded German film and being a German film it feels the need to make a very clear line between good Germans who are portrayed as the ones who are conscripted in to the Wermacht who do all the fighting and dying in pursuit of Nazi ideals and bad Germans who blindly follow Nazi genocidal laws and never serve in the front line. Even the classic DAS BOOT suffers from this viewpoint . The only film that doesn't portray villains as Nazis is the Anglo German production CROSS OF IRON which has a Prussian aristocrat as the bad German . Would it not be a nice change that Germans murdering innocent people weren't necessarily goose stepping Nazis ? The truth is there were plenty of ordinary Wermacht units implicated in crimes against humanity on the Eastern front in the early 1940s For the majority of the film director Joseph Vilsmaier and screenwriter Jurgen Buscher tend to ignore politics and concentrate on making an anti-war film on a grand epic scale . They succeed too as a battalion of 400 men is quickly drained to a troop of 62 men carrying out full frontal assaults against desperate Soviet defenders . The film makers also make a very important point that Nazi Germany was a Christian nation and include a scene where a padre addresses a congregation emphasising that the Germans have God on their side where as the Bolsheviks are Godless atheists . This scene alone meant I could easily forgive the slight clich&eacute;s that creep in to the film Slight clich&eacute;s are easily forgiven . Unfortunately the more the film goes on the more clich&eacute;s come firing at the audience quicker than a Soviet counter-attack . What become even more unforgivable is the introduction of very contrived plotting as in " Someone must do something unlikely and even more unlikely a character who they already know appears to move the plot forward " A number of people who dislike this movie have pointed out the unlikely coincidences of characters who appeared in the film earlier appear and they're right . It's not enough to destroy the film but a battle on the scale of Stalingrad to have people bumping in to each other the way it happens here strains all credibility . Likewise the final third of the film is rather static where people have existentialist discussions and feels more like a German New Wave film from Rainer Werner Fassbinder In short STALINGRAD is a film I always wanted to see since it was released almost 20 years ago . It was worth the wait . It's a sweeping epic war film and is much praised for the battle sequences . It isn't flawless and unfortunately the flaws are very easy to spot and take issue with . As it stands CROSS OF IRON still remains the best film featuring the carnage and hell of fighting on the Eastern front

    Being a WW2 fan, i was a bit late to see this brilliant movie. Although there are not many movies which are shot in German POV, i find this movie full of uncompromising quality and workmanship. Its visually breathtaking, the battle scenes are brutal and chilling, even the conditions are so unbearable and yet greatly filmed. The Story line is unevenly told and lacks a neat narration. The actions scenes stop abruptly and lacking a final punch. At times, the movie drags on and on. The lead actors are good if not great. I feel that with the kind of brilliant setup the film crew had, they could have shot few more brutal action scenes instead of dragging the whole movie. If you really want to have a very few taste of German sympathy towards Communist counterparts, this is the flick and its aptly shown in bits and pieces.

    I would daresay this is a better war film than 'The Schindler's list'. We have seen many war films from the point of views of Russians, Jews, Poles etc. But this was my first world war 2 movie seen from a German soldier's point of view. The film starts when a battalion of German soldiers are ordered to go to Stalingrad. When they think about going to Stalingrad, they think of farms and greenery but when they reach Stalingrad, the truth is far different than the reality. The German soldiers think they could win Russia within a month, their very notion turns into disbelief as they enter Stalingrad, and see thousands of wounded German soldiers. Stalingrad war was indeed the biggest mistake of Germany, and it proved the beginning of the end for Germany, and resurrection of Russia. One thing I always wondered as a child, when a war is waged why there is no confusion, how always a particular army perfectly distinguishes its soldiers from the opponents'. In the very beginning, when Germans invade Stalingrad, we see a massive confusion within the battalion and a German soldier inadvertently kills his fellow soldier. As you may do research, you will find that there was a huge chaos during the world war 2 and such incidents occurred. One thing that the director wants to convey is that all the German soldiers were not blood grubbing monsters, even they were tired of killing other people, even they wanted to go home. But they had no options, if they didn't kill , they would have been killed by their superiors. This thing is evident when a young Russian boy is captured by the German army, and the soldiers who are protagonists in the movie are told to shoot the boy with dozens of other people. They are reluctant to shoot the boy, but their fascist superior warns them that if they didn't shoot those civilians, they would be next in queue. Stalingrad is an attempt by the director to earn some sympathy for the German soldiers, who were always seen as culprits, but this film shows they were victims too. I don't want to get into the war crimes that Germans committed in Russia and other nations, but when you view a film you have to see it impartially. At the very outset of the film, it is very much clear that you are not going to see a happy end as you see in Hollywood. This film makes 'Enemy at the gates' look a very cheap film which is far from reality, as it creates Rachel Weisz's character in the film. This film is not for the people who want to see war films just for the sake of explosions and killings of people. We see scenes in the film where a German soldier shares his bread with a civilian, and also in the end when the Hans Von Witzland refuses to rape a helpless Russian female soldier. This film tells us about the fate of the soldiers who were stuck there and knew what was coming to them. In fact, this movie tells us about the harsh reality of war and it tells that the war is always bad, and there is no winner in a war. This film doesn't show that Russians were bad despite being a German film, nor it shows that Germans were heroes, but still makes its point of earning sympathy for all the soldiers who lost their lives in the battle of Stalingrad.

    A disappointing movie. There are so many things wrong with Stal. that I could spend this review listing them. First, you have to be aware that certain words carry great promise, a promise that has to be fulfilled at the end or you'll disappoint your audience. Such is the case with "Stalingrad". Most of what's wrong with Stal. comes from the approach the filmmakers took. It's clear they thought that to add up another epic to their resume all they had to do was take inland the crew of Das Boot and put them in the cauldron of Stalingrad. Big mistake. There is an enormous difference of context and nature between both cases. If there was one single "clean" form of war during WWII, at least in the European theater, that was the naval war. There were no Nazi atrocities, no Waffen SS, no Shoah on Atlantic waters, so any German director is free to present his characters as regular sailors doing their duty. But that stops there. Once the action moves to the Eastern front, you cannot possibly keep presenting them under the same light. We do know Germans were the bad guys in the USSR and that's good enough for me, so dramatizations of their suffering and dying over there leave me quite indifferent. I wish German directors stopped presenting their WWII soldiers as just poor guys who got a raw deal, who suffered as much as their victims and who deserve our compassion. Funny thing, I don't see them as such poor saps in stock footage, while they were winning. Also don't talk to me, please, about "humanity in war". There is not such thing and that's the genius of films like Coppola's AN or Malick's TTRL: they show us war as it is, as a brutal, unmitigated, carnage where men lose their souls and become bloodthirsty dogs. In Stalingrad there was no other idea in the minds of all Soviet and German soldiers than to kill as many enemies as they could. Only because of that, Enemy At The Gates is far closer to the historic truth. But the "Das Boot "approach is not only wrong because it distorts the historic truth but also because it deprives the flick of an appropriate set up. The Italian beaches with its relaxing German soldiers--copycat of the Boot's partyrobs the opportunity for a tension creating intro, like the crossing of the Volga and the massacre of Russians in EATG. Those terrible scenes throw you headfirst into the battle, creating a sordid atmosphere which remains for the rest of the flick. You sit in awe for the length of it because you have been shaken to the bones with the raw brutality of it allKhrushchev selecting officers to be shot, Russian soldiers being mowed down like cattle--even more so when you know all, or most, really happened. EATG has been savaged by purists for distorting the historic truth, yet it has the merit of giving us an eloquent picture of what Stalingrad really was. The ever present darkness, the sordid surroundings, the atmosphere of death and decay, the stoic--yet without any illusion about their own survival--snipers. Battle scenes in Stal. instead seem to have been shot on home plate in Yankee Stadium; they are drowning in light, which ruins the atmosphere; its only in the gutter scene that we really get the feel. Also, EATG focuses mostly on a little known, yet fascinating, episode: the battle of the snipers, which makes for a far better packaged movie. Stal. instead wastes miles of film in inane bickering amongst the Germans, in futile conflicts between good and evil (the "evil German" is such a cartoon guy I doubt someone like that ever existed) and in skirmishes that appear staged, probably based on pictures of the real battle. Technically this is not a great flick movie either. The cinematography is standard and the directing so--so. I already mentioned the excess light. The pacing is stilted and the editing terrible. You are suddenly thrown in the midst of battle, not knowing how you got there--and as suddenly the action stops. Also, lack of continuity, some scenes just tacked there for no reason (the Russian woman with her baby). Subplots that keep popping up but lead nowhere (The Russian uncle and soldier for ex.). Stal. could have been better it focused instead on an overview of the whole battle and on Von Paulus' conflicted personality and behavior. The director took a gamble here and lost it; at least amongst those who think the Germans got what they deserved. With it settled, most of the empathy is gone. Schmaltzy scenes--let's save the boy from execution, or let's give them bread--don't ring true and instead only make things worse for the "humanity in war" theory. Even worse is the scene between the Russian girl and Witzland. Is she offended because he didn't rape her? Wow. Also, the battle in the snow is unrealistic. Had the Soviets fought like that they would have never won. (when attacked like that you spread out your tanks--not run them into entrenched infantry). But of course the Germans had to win, so they could last to the end of the movie. The best part, the only good one, is the ending, the unlikely trio treading through snow, going nowhere. Had the filmmakers started with that image, concept, and worked backwards this could have been a better flick In all, interesting enough to see once but not enough to remember it. 5.5/10.

    There was a time when I thought war films were just a bunch of random extras being killed. However when I looked at the ones that weren't American I found that War films can truly grip you and make you say "War is pointless". This is one of those "war is pointless" movies. Before anybody splits hairs in asking how the soldiers are portrayed then I will say something. This movie portrays them as soldiers going through a hellish war, just like the Finnish movie Talvisota (one I would HIGHLY recommend for fans of this movie). For other aspects of the film, it is well acted, the message came across loud and clear, nothing is Hollywood in this movie in terms of portrayal or anything else. I was expecting the ending because the producers were the same people who produced Das Boot For those people that want to see a fantastic war film about the front line should watch this.

    It's hard to deny this is an excellent film. Impeccable acting, direction and photography create a powerful depiction of war at its most miserable, futile and degrading. But I do think two mild criticisms need to be stated. First, a movie titled "Stalingrad" ought to present at least some vague overview of that historical battle. Aside from a few confusing references to the wider tactical situation, this move sticks to a worms-eye view. After a while, you even have to wonder whether the travails of this particular group of soldiers are at all typical of the huge German force involved at the time. The film works as drama, but if you call it simply "Stalingrad," I think you're promising a bit of historical context. Second, the pace is a tiny bit over-drawn. In the last third of the film, I reached an atrocity overload, where further horrors had progressively less impact. I began to disconnect from the characters, remaining only mildly curious as to what agonizingly tragic ways would be found to dispatch them. A stronger dramatic hook is needed, to pull us through the admitted hopelessness of this last segment. These are far from fatal flaws. It's more a question of balance. A bit more context, a slightly tighter narrative, and this could have been a masterpiece. As it is, I'd say it's a really excellent film, that does show - unforgettably - how war deadens the soul, even if it fails to kill the body. Still, I have to hope that other filmmakers will one day present a broader view of the battle of Stalingrad. There's still lots of historical ground that needs to be covered, if future generations are to understand the madness that created this nightmarish conflict.

    Stalingrad is not the best war film. At times, I found the sub-par acting by extras and use of stock sound effects really killed the depth of a scene. I also found that I couldn't keep a track of which characters were which, this may have been due to similar faces and language barriers creating trouble with indistinguishable accents. Between scenes, there would be such large gaps in time that you wouldn't be able to tell how a situation arose or what the situation was in some cases, making the story hard to follow. These factors limited my ability to feel the exhaustion and suffering of the characters, and left me slightly disengaged. The reason for my high mark, however, is attributed to the final scenes. The raw emotion coming from the few remaining actors is highly visible on this precious smaller scope, and the eventual plight of each character is played out in such devastating detail that I sat in silence in a dark room long after the credits had finished rolling and felt compelled after to even write some poetry. If you came to this film to see the struggle of a battle, you could do better, but stick around for the ending, it's very much worth it.

    For losers of a war or a battle, it is not customary to create something depicting their defeat, especially if this happened not so long time ago. E.g., Russians have had several defeats in the post WW II period - could you imagine them picturing this? With Stalingrad 1993, Germans have crudely shown the horrors and sufferings in one of the most severe battles in the WW II, without glorifying themselves and without scoffing at their enemy. On the other hand, Soviet Russia was no innocent victim, its treatment of own and neighboring people in the 1930ies was nasty and lethal as well, and Soviet (non-)activities were largely a reason why Hitler had courage to start this horrible war. As for the movie, the events and background seem realistic (probably shot in Finland), most of actors performing Russians speak decent Russian, and leading men are catchy to follow (primarily Dominique Horwitz as Obergefreiter Fritz Reiser, Thomas Kretschmann as Leutnant Hans Von Witzland, Jochen Nickel as Unteroffizier Manfred "Rollo" Rohleder). However, some of the scenes could have been shortened, and direct battle scenes comprise only a small part of the movie. The ending is predictable, although the scenes leading to it are well directed. It seems that the creators wanted to combine profound human aspect with concrete battle, but for this task, the movie was too short - a miniseries could have been more appropriate. Nevertheless, if you like war movies based on real events, Stalingrad is worth watching.

    Being a WW2 fan, i was a bit late to see this brilliant movie. Although there are not many movies which are shot in German POV, i find this movie full of uncompromising quality and workmanship. Its visually breathtaking, the battle scenes are brutal and chilling, even the conditions are so unbearable and yet greatly filmed. The Story line is unevenly told and lacks a neat narration. The actions scenes stop abruptly and lacking a final punch. At times, the movie drags on and on. The lead actors are good if not great. I feel that with the kind of brilliant setup the film crew had, they could have shot few more brutal action scenes instead of dragging the whole movie. If you really want to have a very few taste of German sympathy towards Communist counterparts, this is the flick and its aptly shown in bits and pieces.

    I would daresay this is a better war film than 'The Schindler's list'. We have seen many war films from the point of views of Russians, Jews, Poles etc. But this was my first world war 2 movie seen from a German soldier's point of view. The film starts when a battalion of German soldiers are ordered to go to Stalingrad. When they think about going to Stalingrad, they think of farms and greenery but when they reach Stalingrad, the truth is far different than the reality. The German soldiers think they could win Russia within a month, their very notion turns into disbelief as they enter Stalingrad, and see thousands of wounded German soldiers. Stalingrad war was indeed the biggest mistake of Germany, and it proved the beginning of the end for Germany, and resurrection of Russia. One thing I always wondered as a child, when a war is waged why there is no confusion, how always a particular army perfectly distinguishes its soldiers from the opponents'. In the very beginning, when Germans invade Stalingrad, we see a massive confusion within the battalion and a German soldier inadvertently kills his fellow soldier. As you may do research, you will find that there was a huge chaos during the world war 2 and such incidents occurred. One thing that the director wants to convey is that all the German soldiers were not blood grubbing monsters, even they were tired of killing other people, even they wanted to go home. But they had no options, if they didn't kill , they would have been killed by their superiors. This thing is evident when a young Russian boy is captured by the German army, and the soldiers who are protagonists in the movie are told to shoot the boy with dozens of other people. They are reluctant to shoot the boy, but their fascist superior warns them that if they didn't shoot those civilians, they would be next in queue. Stalingrad is an attempt by the director to earn some sympathy for the German soldiers, who were always seen as culprits, but this film shows they were victims too. I don't want to get into the war crimes that Germans committed in Russia and other nations, but when you view a film you have to see it impartially. At the very outset of the film, it is very much clear that you are not going to see a happy end as you see in Hollywood. This film makes 'Enemy at the gates' look a very cheap film which is far from reality, as it creates Rachel Weisz's character in the film. This film is not for the people who want to see war films just for the sake of explosions and killings of people. We see scenes in the film where a German soldier shares his bread with a civilian, and also in the end when the Hans Von Witzland refuses to rape a helpless Russian female soldier. This film tells us about the fate of the soldiers who were stuck there and knew what was coming to them. In fact, this movie tells us about the harsh reality of war and it tells that the war is always bad, and there is no winner in a war. This film doesn't show that Russians were bad despite being a German film, nor it shows that Germans were heroes, but still makes its point of earning sympathy for all the soldiers who lost their lives in the battle of Stalingrad.

    A disappointing movie. There are so many things wrong with Stal. that I could spend this review listing them. First, you have to be aware that certain words carry great promise, a promise that has to be fulfilled at the end or you'll disappoint your audience. Such is the case with "Stalingrad". Most of what's wrong with Stal. comes from the approach the filmmakers took. It's clear they thought that to add up another epic to their resume all they had to do was take inland the crew of Das Boot and put them in the cauldron of Stalingrad. Big mistake. There is an enormous difference of context and nature between both cases. If there was one single "clean" form of war during WWII, at least in the European theater, that was the naval war. There were no Nazi atrocities, no Waffen SS, no Shoah on Atlantic waters, so any German director is free to present his characters as regular sailors doing their duty. But that stops there. Once the action moves to the Eastern front, you cannot possibly keep presenting them under the same light. We do know Germans were the bad guys in the USSR and that's good enough for me, so dramatizations of their suffering and dying over there leave me quite indifferent. I wish German directors stopped presenting their WWII soldiers as just poor guys who got a raw deal, who suffered as much as their victims and who deserve our compassion. Funny thing, I don't see them as such poor saps in stock footage, while they were winning. Also don't talk to me, please, about "humanity in war". There is not such thing and that's the genius of films like Coppola's AN or Malick's TTRL: they show us war as it is, as a brutal, unmitigated, carnage where men lose their souls and become bloodthirsty dogs. In Stalingrad there was no other idea in the minds of all Soviet and German soldiers than to kill as many enemies as they could. Only because of that, Enemy At The Gates is far closer to the historic truth. But the "Das Boot "approach is not only wrong because it distorts the historic truth but also because it deprives the flick of an appropriate set up. The Italian beaches with its relaxing German soldiers--copycat of the Boot's partyrobs the opportunity for a tension creating intro, like the crossing of the Volga and the massacre of Russians in EATG. Those terrible scenes throw you headfirst into the battle, creating a sordid atmosphere which remains for the rest of the flick. You sit in awe for the length of it because you have been shaken to the bones with the raw brutality of it allKhrushchev selecting officers to be shot, Russian soldiers being mowed down like cattle--even more so when you know all, or most, really happened. EATG has been savaged by purists for distorting the historic truth, yet it has the merit of giving us an eloquent picture of what Stalingrad really was. The ever present darkness, the sordid surroundings, the atmosphere of death and decay, the stoic--yet without any illusion about their own survival--snipers. Battle scenes in Stal. instead seem to have been shot on home plate in Yankee Stadium; they are drowning in light, which ruins the atmosphere; its only in the gutter scene that we really get the feel. Also, EATG focuses mostly on a little known, yet fascinating, episode: the battle of the snipers, which makes for a far better packaged movie. Stal. instead wastes miles of film in inane bickering amongst the Germans, in futile conflicts between good and evil (the "evil German" is such a cartoon guy I doubt someone like that ever existed) and in skirmishes that appear staged, probably based on pictures of the real battle. Technically this is not a great flick movie either. The cinematography is standard and the directing so--so. I already mentioned the excess light. The pacing is stilted and the editing terrible. You are suddenly thrown in the midst of battle, not knowing how you got there--and as suddenly the action stops. Also, lack of continuity, some scenes just tacked there for no reason (the Russian woman with her baby). Subplots that keep popping up but lead nowhere (The Russian uncle and soldier for ex.). Stal. could have been better it focused instead on an overview of the whole battle and on Von Paulus' conflicted personality and behavior. The director took a gamble here and lost it; at least amongst those who think the Germans got what they deserved. With it settled, most of the empathy is gone. Schmaltzy scenes--let's save the boy from execution, or let's give them bread--don't ring true and instead only make things worse for the "humanity in war" theory. Even worse is the scene between the Russian girl and Witzland. Is she offended because he didn't rape her? Wow. Also, the battle in the snow is unrealistic. Had the Soviets fought like that they would have never won. (when attacked like that you spread out your tanks--not run them into entrenched infantry). But of course the Germans had to win, so they could last to the end of the movie. The best part, the only good one, is the ending, the unlikely trio treading through snow, going nowhere. Had the filmmakers started with that image, concept, and worked backwards this could have been a better flick In all, interesting enough to see once but not enough to remember it. 5.5/10.

    There was a time when I thought war films were just a bunch of random extras being killed. However when I looked at the ones that weren't American I found that War films can truly grip you and make you say "War is pointless". This is one of those "war is pointless" movies. Before anybody splits hairs in asking how the soldiers are portrayed then I will say something. This movie portrays them as soldiers going through a hellish war, just like the Finnish movie Talvisota (one I would HIGHLY recommend for fans of this movie). For other aspects of the film, it is well acted, the message came across loud and clear, nothing is Hollywood in this movie in terms of portrayal or anything else. I was expecting the ending because the producers were the same people who produced Das Boot For those people that want to see a fantastic war film about the front line should watch this.

    It's hard to deny this is an excellent film. Impeccable acting, direction and photography create a powerful depiction of war at its most miserable, futile and degrading. But I do think two mild criticisms need to be stated. First, a movie titled "Stalingrad" ought to present at least some vague overview of that historical battle. Aside from a few confusing references to the wider tactical situation, this move sticks to a worms-eye view. After a while, you even have to wonder whether the travails of this particular group of soldiers are at all typical of the huge German force involved at the time. The film works as drama, but if you call it simply "Stalingrad," I think you're promising a bit of historical context. Second, the pace is a tiny bit over-drawn. In the last third of the film, I reached an atrocity overload, where further horrors had progressively less impact. I began to disconnect from the characters, remaining only mildly curious as to what agonizingly tragic ways would be found to dispatch them. A stronger dramatic hook is needed, to pull us through the admitted hopelessness of this last segment. These are far from fatal flaws. It's more a question of balance. A bit more context, a slightly tighter narrative, and this could have been a masterpiece. As it is, I'd say it's a really excellent film, that does show - unforgettably - how war deadens the soul, even if it fails to kill the body. Still, I have to hope that other filmmakers will one day present a broader view of the battle of Stalingrad. There's still lots of historical ground that needs to be covered, if future generations are to understand the madness that created this nightmarish conflict.

    Stalingrad is not the best war film. At times, I found the sub-par acting by extras and use of stock sound effects really killed the depth of a scene. I also found that I couldn't keep a track of which characters were which, this may have been due to similar faces and language barriers creating trouble with indistinguishable accents. Between scenes, there would be such large gaps in time that you wouldn't be able to tell how a situation arose or what the situation was in some cases, making the story hard to follow. These factors limited my ability to feel the exhaustion and suffering of the characters, and left me slightly disengaged. The reason for my high mark, however, is attributed to the final scenes. The raw emotion coming from the few remaining actors is highly visible on this precious smaller scope, and the eventual plight of each character is played out in such devastating detail that I sat in silence in a dark room long after the credits had finished rolling and felt compelled after to even write some poetry. If you came to this film to see the struggle of a battle, you could do better, but stick around for the ending, it's very much worth it.

    For losers of a war or a battle, it is not customary to create something depicting their defeat, especially if this happened not so long time ago. E.g., Russians have had several defeats in the post WW II period - could you imagine them picturing this? With Stalingrad 1993, Germans have crudely shown the horrors and sufferings in one of the most severe battles in the WW II, without glorifying themselves and without scoffing at their enemy. On the other hand, Soviet Russia was no innocent victim, its treatment of own and neighboring people in the 1930ies was nasty and lethal as well, and Soviet (non-)activities were largely a reason why Hitler had courage to start this horrible war. As for the movie, the events and background seem realistic (probably shot in Finland), most of actors performing Russians speak decent Russian, and leading men are catchy to follow (primarily Dominique Horwitz as Obergefreiter Fritz Reiser, Thomas Kretschmann as Leutnant Hans Von Witzland, Jochen Nickel as Unteroffizier Manfred "Rollo" Rohleder). However, some of the scenes could have been shortened, and direct battle scenes comprise only a small part of the movie. The ending is predictable, although the scenes leading to it are well directed. It seems that the creators wanted to combine profound human aspect with concrete battle, but for this task, the movie was too short - a miniseries could have been more appropriate. Nevertheless, if you like war movies based on real events, Stalingrad is worth watching.

    The movie has a lot of good points, as have been shown in other review. However, the battle scenes in this movie are a little bit silly in my eyes: 1. At the beginning battle of the movie, the storm company (or battalion?) was tasked to overwhelm the defenders of the factory. The captain wanted to close the quarter quietly and launch the offensive without rousing the defenders. Yet, a rifle was fired unwillingly by an infantry who jumped in, which waked up the defenders and caused a lot of casualties in the attacking force. Later, the captain gave the soldier a hand-grenade to eliminate the machine-gun which is mowing down the German soldiers. That soldier just ran toward the machine-gun without much dodging movements, not even lowering his body. And he didn't get mowed down by the machine-gun. This contradicted the usual common sense. What's more, the German hand-grenade's advantage is its throwing distance, but the explosive in it is not as much as the U.S. fragmentation ones. So I am quite doubtful that a potato-masher would destroy a machine-gun pillbox, as shown in the movie. Plus, Stalingrad would not have gained its nickname "Street-fight Academy" if the defender's position is so easy to overthrow. In the ruins of the Stalingrad, it is impossible to imagine such a single machine-gun pillbox without supporting cross-fire from other directions. If it were that simple, the 6th Army would have captured the city long before the winter began. 2. In the middle of the movie, over the snow-covered steppe, Lieutenant Witzland's platoon is ordered to hold an area where the Russian wanted to break in with their tanks. The soldiers either used Panzerfaust to give the tank a direct hit, or waited in the foxhole until the tank rolled over, and attached the ad-hoc high-explosive to its rear-engine part to break it down. After that, the infantry soldiers attached to the tank or behind it were mowed down by German MP40 or MG42. As far as I know, the usual way of fighting with a mixed mechanized formation is to let the infantry soldiers come forward to scout the hidden enemy fire positions, to expose them and let them be licked up by the up-coming tanks. No, the tanks would never thrust forward by themselves. That way, they would be easy targets for Panzerfausts or Bazookas. The tanks would go all by themselves only in very large formations, say, a tank division or a tank army. In that case, the enemy would not have a chance to come behind the leading tanks and explode them from behind - anyone who tried to do this would be mowed down by the machine-gun in the following-up tanks. In short, the movie is successful in humanizing the German soldiers fighting in Stalingrad, but it made a big mistake in over-simplifying the battle scenes and under-estimating the Russian force too much, just the same errors commit by the Fuhrer and General Staff of Wehrmacht. The Russian would not have won the Battle of Stalingrad if they fought in the way described in the movie.

    A battalion of German soldiers from the Afrika Corps are spending some time at an Italian port during the summer of 1942. At that particular time their spirits were high as the German army was in the process of advancing victoriously into Russia. But all that was subject to change as their next assignment would be: Stalingrad. And they had no idea what was in store for them. At any rate, told from the German perspective, this film does a remarkable job of showing the hardships and tragedy these soldiers had to endure. Despite proving themselves in battle, their courage and discipline was being tested as much by the Russian winter as it was their Russian foes. And yet they continued on all the same. Now, while everybody knows how this battle eventually played out, this movie allows the viewer to gain a unique understanding of how it may have appeared through the eyes of the German soldier. Definitely worth a watch for those who can appreciate a film of this type.

    The battle of Stalingrad is beyond human imagination . It is an event in history that sends a shiver down the spine . Nazi Germany lost one quarter of its total strength on the Eastern front during this one battle . That's if you can even call it a battle , the number of forces involved meant it was more of campaign . And if the scale of the battle wasn't mind numbing enough it's the conditions and ferocity of the fighting that sticks in the mind . As a young schoolboy in the 1970s I vividly remember reading accounts " that every brick in every house in every street was bitterly fought over " . Even in the 21st century with the invasion of Iraq military experts have to emphasise that the capture of Baghdad wouldn't resemble Stalingrad in anyway . In short if you want to visualize war at its most cruel and brutal pick up a history book on Stalingrad . You almost feel sorry for the bad guys . I did say " almost" This is a slight problem with this cinematic account of the battle . STALINGRAD is a very well regarded German film and being a German film it feels the need to make a very clear line between good Germans who are portrayed as the ones who are conscripted in to the Wermacht who do all the fighting and dying in pursuit of Nazi ideals and bad Germans who blindly follow Nazi genocidal laws and never serve in the front line. Even the classic DAS BOOT suffers from this viewpoint . The only film that doesn't portray villains as Nazis is the Anglo German production CROSS OF IRON which has a Prussian aristocrat as the bad German . Would it not be a nice change that Germans murdering innocent people weren't necessarily goose stepping Nazis ? The truth is there were plenty of ordinary Wermacht units implicated in crimes against humanity on the Eastern front in the early 1940s For the majority of the film director Joseph Vilsmaier and screenwriter Jurgen Buscher tend to ignore politics and concentrate on making an anti-war film on a grand epic scale . They succeed too as a battalion of 400 men is quickly drained to a troop of 62 men carrying out full frontal assaults against desperate Soviet defenders . The film makers also make a very important point that Nazi Germany was a Christian nation and include a scene where a padre addresses a congregation emphasising that the Germans have God on their side where as the Bolsheviks are Godless atheists . This scene alone meant I could easily forgive the slight clich&eacute;s that creep in to the film Slight clich&eacute;s are easily forgiven . Unfortunately the more the film goes on the more clich&eacute;s come firing at the audience quicker than a Soviet counter-attack . What become even more unforgivable is the introduction of very contrived plotting as in " Someone must do something unlikely and even more unlikely a character who they already know appears to move the plot forward " A number of people who dislike this movie have pointed out the unlikely coincidences of characters who appeared in the film earlier appear and they're right . It's not enough to destroy the film but a battle on the scale of Stalingrad to have people bumping in to each other the way it happens here strains all credibility . Likewise the final third of the film is rather static where people have existentialist discussions and feels more like a German New Wave film from Rainer Werner Fassbinder In short STALINGRAD is a film I always wanted to see since it was released almost 20 years ago . It was worth the wait . It's a sweeping epic war film and is much praised for the battle sequences . It isn't flawless and unfortunately the flaws are very easy to spot and take issue with . As it stands CROSS OF IRON still remains the best film featuring the carnage and hell of fighting on the Eastern front

Stal. could have been better it focused instead on an overview of the whole battle and on Von Paulus' conflicted personality and behavior. The director took a gamble here and lost it; at least amongst those who think the Germans got what they deserved. With it settled, most of the empathy is gone. Schmaltzy scenes--let's save the boy from execution, or let's give them bread--don't ring true and instead only make things worse for the "humanity in war" theory. Even worse is the scene between the Russian girl and Witzland. Is she offended because he didn't rape her? Wow. Also, the battle in the snow is unrealistic. Had the Soviets fought like that they would have never won. (when attacked like that you spread out your tanks--not run them into entrenched infantry). But of course the Germans had to win, so they could last to the end of the movie. The best part, the only good one, is the ending, the unlikely trio treading through snow, going nowhere. Had the filmmakers started with that image, concept, and worked backwards this could have been a better flick In all, interesting enough to see once but not enough to remember it. 5.5/10.

    There was a time when I thought war films were just a bunch of random extras being killed. However when I looked at the ones that weren't American I found that War films can truly grip you and make you say "War is pointless". This is one of those "war is pointless" movies. Before anybody splits hairs in asking how the soldiers are portrayed then I will say something. This movie portrays them as soldiers going through a hellish war, just like the Finnish movie Talvisota (one I would HIGHLY recommend for fans of this movie). For other aspects of the film, it is well acted, the message came across loud and clear, nothing is Hollywood in this movie in terms of portrayal or anything else. I was expecting the ending because the producers were the same people who produced Das Boot For those people that want to see a fantastic war film about the front line should watch this.

    It's hard to deny this is an excellent film. Impeccable acting, direction and photography create a powerful depiction of war at its most miserable, futile and degrading. But I do think two mild criticisms need to be stated. First, a movie titled "Stalingrad" ought to present at least some vague overview of that historical battle. Aside from a few confusing references to the wider tactical situation, this move sticks to a worms-eye view. After a while, you even have to wonder whether the travails of this particular group of soldiers are at all typical of the huge German force involved at the time. The film works as drama, but if you call it simply "Stalingrad," I think you're promising a bit of historical context. Second, the pace is a tiny bit over-drawn. In the last third of the film, I reached an atrocity overload, where further horrors had progressively less impact. I began to disconnect from the characters, remaining only mildly curious as to what agonizingly tragic ways would be found to dispatch them. A stronger dramatic hook is needed, to pull us through the admitted hopelessness of this last segment. These are far from fatal flaws. It's more a question of balance. A bit more context, a slightly tighter narrative, and this could have been a masterpiece. As it is, I'd say it's a really excellent film, that does show - unforgettably - how war deadens the soul, even if it fails to kill the body. Still, I have to hope that other filmmakers will one day present a broader view of the battle of Stalingrad. There's still lots of historical ground that needs to be covered, if future generations are to understand the madness that created this nightmarish conflict.

    Stalingrad is not the best war film. At times, I found the sub-par acting by extras and use of stock sound effects really killed the depth of a scene. I also found that I couldn't keep a track of which characters were which, this may have been due to similar faces and language barriers creating trouble with indistinguishable accents. Between scenes, there would be such large gaps in time that you wouldn't be able to tell how a situation arose or what the situation was in some cases, making the story hard to follow. These factors limited my ability to feel the exhaustion and suffering of the characters, and left me slightly disengaged. The reason for my high mark, however, is attributed to the final scenes. The raw emotion coming from the few remaining actors is highly visible on this precious smaller scope, and the eventual plight of each character is played out in such devastating detail that I sat in silence in a dark room long after the credits had finished rolling and felt compelled after to even write some poetry. If you came to this film to see the struggle of a battle, you could do better, but stick around for the ending, it's very much worth it.

    For losers of a war or a battle, it is not customary to create something depicting their defeat, especially if this happened not so long time ago. E.g., Russians have had several defeats in the post WW II period - could you imagine them picturing this? With Stalingrad 1993, Germans have crudely shown the horrors and sufferings in one of the most severe battles in the WW II, without glorifying themselves and without scoffing at their enemy. On the other hand, Soviet Russia was no innocent victim, its treatment of own and neighboring people in the 1930ies was nasty and lethal as well, and Soviet (non-)activities were largely a reason why Hitler had courage to start this horrible war. As for the movie, the events and background seem realistic (probably shot in Finland), most of actors performing Russians speak decent Russian, and leading men are catchy to follow (primarily Dominique Horwitz as Obergefreiter Fritz Reiser, Thomas Kretschmann as Leutnant Hans Von Witzland, Jochen Nickel as Unteroffizier Manfred "Rollo" Rohleder). However, some of the scenes could have been shortened, and direct battle scenes comprise only a small part of the movie. The ending is predictable, although the scenes leading to it are well directed. It seems that the creators wanted to combine profound human aspect with concrete battle, but for this task, the movie was too short - a miniseries could have been more appropriate. Nevertheless, if you like war movies based on real events, Stalingrad is worth watching.

    The movie has a lot of good points, as have been shown in other review. However, the battle scenes in this movie are a little bit silly in my eyes: 1. At the beginning battle of the movie, the storm company (or battalion?) was tasked to overwhelm the defenders of the factory. The captain wanted to close the quarter quietly and launch the offensive without rousing the defenders. Yet, a rifle was fired unwillingly by an infantry who jumped in, which waked up the defenders and caused a lot of casualties in the attacking force. Later, the captain gave the soldier a hand-grenade to eliminate the machine-gun which is mowing down the German soldiers. That soldier just ran toward the machine-gun without much dodging movements, not even lowering his body. And he didn't get mowed down by the machine-gun. This contradicted the usual common sense. What's more, the German hand-grenade's advantage is its throwing distance, but the explosive in it is not as much as the U.S. fragmentation ones. So I am quite doubtful that a potato-masher would destroy a machine-gun pillbox, as shown in the movie. Plus, Stalingrad would not have gained its nickname "Street-fight Academy" if the defender's position is so easy to overthrow. In the ruins of the Stalingrad, it is impossible to imagine such a single machine-gun pillbox without supporting cross-fire from other directions. If it were that simple, the 6th Army would have captured the city long before the winter began. 2. In the middle of the movie, over the snow-covered steppe, Lieutenant Witzland's platoon is ordered to hold an area where the Russian wanted to break in with their tanks. The soldiers either used Panzerfaust to give the tank a direct hit, or waited in the foxhole until the tank rolled over, and attached the ad-hoc high-explosive to its rear-engine part to break it down. After that, the infantry soldiers attached to the tank or behind it were mowed down by German MP40 or MG42. As far as I know, the usual way of fighting with a mixed mechanized formation is to let the infantry soldiers come forward to scout the hidden enemy fire positions, to expose them and let them be licked up by the up-coming tanks. No, the tanks would never thrust forward by themselves. That way, they would be easy targets for Panzerfausts or Bazookas. The tanks would go all by themselves only in very large formations, say, a tank division or a tank army. In that case, the enemy would not have a chance to come behind the leading tanks and explode them from behind - anyone who tried to do this would be mowed down by the machine-gun in the following-up tanks. In short, the movie is successful in humanizing the German soldiers fighting in Stalingrad, but it made a big mistake in over-simplifying the battle scenes and under-estimating the Russian force too much, just the same errors commit by the Fuhrer and General Staff of Wehrmacht. The Russian would not have won the Battle of Stalingrad if they fought in the way described in the movie.

    A battalion of German soldiers from the Afrika Corps are spending some time at an Italian port during the summer of 1942. At that particular time their spirits were high as the German army was in the process of advancing victoriously into Russia. But all that was subject to change as their next assignment would be: Stalingrad. And they had no idea what was in store for them. At any rate, told from the German perspective, this film does a remarkable job of showing the hardships and tragedy these soldiers had to endure. Despite proving themselves in battle, their courage and discipline was being tested as much by the Russian winter as it was their Russian foes. And yet they continued on all the same. Now, while everybody knows how this battle eventually played out, this movie allows the viewer to gain a unique understanding of how it may have appeared through the eyes of the German soldier. Definitely worth a watch for those who can appreciate a film of this type.

    The battle of Stalingrad is beyond human imagination . It is an event in history that sends a shiver down the spine . Nazi Germany lost one quarter of its total strength on the Eastern front during this one battle . That's if you can even call it a battle , the number of forces involved meant it was more of campaign . And if the scale of the battle wasn't mind numbing enough it's the conditions and ferocity of the fighting that sticks in the mind . As a young schoolboy in the 1970s I vividly remember reading accounts " that every brick in every house in every street was bitterly fought over " . Even in the 21st century with the invasion of Iraq military experts have to emphasise that the capture of Baghdad wouldn't resemble Stalingrad in anyway . In short if you want to visualize war at its most cruel and brutal pick up a history book on Stalingrad . You almost feel sorry for the bad guys . I did say " almost" This is a slight problem with this cinematic account of the battle . STALINGRAD is a very well regarded German film and being a German film it feels the need to make a very clear line between good Germans who are portrayed as the ones who are conscripted in to the Wermacht who do all the fighting and dying in pursuit of Nazi ideals and bad Germans who blindly follow Nazi genocidal laws and never serve in the front line. Even the classic DAS BOOT suffers from this viewpoint . The only film that doesn't portray villains as Nazis is the Anglo German production CROSS OF IRON which has a Prussian aristocrat as the bad German . Would it not be a nice change that Germans murdering innocent people weren't necessarily goose stepping Nazis ? The truth is there were plenty of ordinary Wermacht units implicated in crimes against humanity on the Eastern front in the early 1940s For the majority of the film director Joseph Vilsmaier and screenwriter Jurgen Buscher tend to ignore politics and concentrate on making an anti-war film on a grand epic scale . They succeed too as a battalion of 400 men is quickly drained to a troop of 62 men carrying out full frontal assaults against desperate Soviet defenders . The film makers also make a very important point that Nazi Germany was a Christian nation and include a scene where a padre addresses a congregation emphasising that the Germans have God on their side where as the Bolsheviks are Godless atheists . This scene alone meant I could easily forgive the slight clich&eacute;s that creep in to the film Slight clich&eacute;s are easily forgiven . Unfortunately the more the film goes on the more clich&eacute;s come firing at the audience quicker than a Soviet counter-attack . What become even more unforgivable is the introduction of very contrived plotting as in " Someone must do something unlikely and even more unlikely a character who they already know appears to move the plot forward " A number of people who dislike this movie have pointed out the unlikely coincidences of characters who appeared in the film earlier appear and they're right . It's not enough to destroy the film but a battle on the scale of Stalingrad to have people bumping in to each other the way it happens here strains all credibility . Likewise the final third of the film is rather static where people have existentialist discussions and feels more like a German New Wave film from Rainer Werner Fassbinder In short STALINGRAD is a film I always wanted to see since it was released almost 20 years ago . It was worth the wait . It's a sweeping epic war film and is much praised for the battle sequences . It isn't flawless and unfortunately the flaws are very easy to spot and take issue with . As it stands CROSS OF IRON still remains the best film featuring the carnage and hell of fighting on the Eastern front

    Being a WW2 fan, i was a bit late to see this brilliant movie. Although there are not many movies which are shot in German POV, i find this movie full of uncompromising quality and workmanship. Its visually breathtaking, the battle scenes are brutal and chilling, even the conditions are so unbearable and yet greatly filmed. The Story line is unevenly told and lacks a neat narration. The actions scenes stop abruptly and lacking a final punch. At times, the movie drags on and on. The lead actors are good if not great. I feel that with the kind of brilliant setup the film crew had, they could have shot few more brutal action scenes instead of dragging the whole movie. If you really want to have a very few taste of German sympathy towards Communist counterparts, this is the flick and its aptly shown in bits and pieces.

    I would daresay this is a better war film than 'The Schindler's list'. We have seen many war films from the point of views of Russians, Jews, Poles etc. But this was my first world war 2 movie seen from a German soldier's point of view. The film starts when a battalion of German soldiers are ordered to go to Stalingrad. When they think about going to Stalingrad, they think of farms and greenery but when they reach Stalingrad, the truth is far different than the reality. The German soldiers think they could win Russia within a month, their very notion turns into disbelief as they enter Stalingrad, and see thousands of wounded German soldiers. Stalingrad war was indeed the biggest mistake of Germany, and it proved the beginning of the end for Germany, and resurrection of Russia. One thing I always wondered as a child, when a war is waged why there is no confusion, how always a particular army perfectly distinguishes its soldiers from the opponents'. In the very beginning, when Germans invade Stalingrad, we see a massive confusion within the battalion and a German soldier inadvertently kills his fellow soldier. As you may do research, you will find that there was a huge chaos during the world war 2 and such incidents occurred. One thing that the director wants to convey is that all the German soldiers were not blood grubbing monsters, even they were tired of killing other people, even they wanted to go home. But they had no options, if they didn't kill , they would have been killed by their superiors. This thing is evident when a young Russian boy is captured by the German army, and the soldiers who are protagonists in the movie are told to shoot the boy with dozens of other people. They are reluctant to shoot the boy, but their fascist superior warns them that if they didn't shoot those civilians, they would be next in queue. Stalingrad is an attempt by the director to earn some sympathy for the German soldiers, who were always seen as culprits, but this film shows they were victims too. I don't want to get into the war crimes that Germans committed in Russia and other nations, but when you view a film you have to see it impartially. At the very outset of the film, it is very much clear that you are not going to see a happy end as you see in Hollywood. This film makes 'Enemy at the gates' look a very cheap film which is far from reality, as it creates Rachel Weisz's character in the film. This film is not for the people who want to see war films just for the sake of explosions and killings of people. We see scenes in the film where a German soldier shares his bread with a civilian, and also in the end when the Hans Von Witzland refuses to rape a helpless Russian female soldier. This film tells us about the fate of the soldiers who were stuck there and knew what was coming to them. In fact, this movie tells us about the harsh reality of war and it tells that the war is always bad, and there is no winner in a war. This film doesn't show that Russians were bad despite being a German film, nor it shows that Germans were heroes, but still makes its point of earning sympathy for all the soldiers who lost their lives in the battle of Stalingrad.

    A disappointing movie. There are so many things wrong with Stal. that I could spend this review listing them. First, you have to be aware that certain words carry great promise, a promise that has to be fulfilled at the end or you'll disappoint your audience. Such is the case with "Stalingrad". Most of what's wrong with Stal. comes from the approach the filmmakers took. It's clear they thought that to add up another epic to their resume all they had to do was take inland the crew of Das Boot and put them in the cauldron of Stalingrad. Big mistake. There is an enormous difference of context and nature between both cases. If there was one single "clean" form of war during WWII, at least in the European theater, that was the naval war. There were no Nazi atrocities, no Waffen SS, no Shoah on Atlantic waters, so any German director is free to present his characters as regular sailors doing their duty. But that stops there. Once the action moves to the Eastern front, you cannot possibly keep presenting them under the same light. We do know Germans were the bad guys in the USSR and that's good enough for me, so dramatizations of their suffering and dying over there leave me quite indifferent. I wish German directors stopped presenting their WWII soldiers as just poor guys who got a raw deal, who suffered as much as their victims and who deserve our compassion. Funny thing, I don't see them as such poor saps in stock footage, while they were winning. Also don't talk to me, please, about "humanity in war". There is not such thing and that's the genius of films like Coppola's AN or Malick's TTRL: they show us war as it is, as a brutal, unmitigated, carnage where men lose their souls and become bloodthirsty dogs. In Stalingrad there was no other idea in the minds of all Soviet and German soldiers than to kill as many enemies as they could. Only because of that, Enemy At The Gates is far closer to the historic truth. But the "Das Boot "approach is not only wrong because it distorts the historic truth but also because it deprives the flick of an appropriate set up. The Italian beaches with its relaxing German soldiers--copycat of the Boot's partyrobs the opportunity for a tension creating intro, like the crossing of the Volga and the massacre of Russians in EATG. Those terrible scenes throw you headfirst into the battle, creating a sordid atmosphere which remains for the rest of the flick. You sit in awe for the length of it because you have been shaken to the bones with the raw brutality of it allKhrushchev selecting officers to be shot, Russian soldiers being mowed down like cattle--even more so when you know all, or most, really happened. EATG has been savaged by purists for distorting the historic truth, yet it has the merit of giving us an eloquent picture of what Stalingrad really was. The ever present darkness, the sordid surroundings, the atmosphere of death and decay, the stoic--yet without any illusion about their own survival--snipers. Battle scenes in Stal. instead seem to have been shot on home plate in Yankee Stadium; they are drowning in light, which ruins the atmosphere; its only in the gutter scene that we really get the feel. Also, EATG focuses mostly on a little known, yet fascinating, episode: the battle of the snipers, which makes for a far better packaged movie. Stal. instead wastes miles of film in inane bickering amongst the Germans, in futile conflicts between good and evil (the "evil German" is such a cartoon guy I doubt someone like that ever existed) and in skirmishes that appear staged, probably based on pictures of the real battle. Technically this is not a great flick movie either. The cinematography is standard and the directing so--so. I already mentioned the excess light. The pacing is stilted and the editing terrible. You are suddenly thrown in the midst of battle, not knowing how you got there--and as suddenly the action stops. Also, lack of continuity, some scenes just tacked there for no reason (the Russian woman with her baby). Subplots that keep popping up but lead nowhere (The Russian uncle and soldier for ex.). Stal. could have been better it focused instead on an overview of the whole battle and on Von Paulus' conflicted personality and behavior. The director took a gamble here and lost it; at least amongst those who think the Germans got what they deserved. With it settled, most of the empathy is gone. Schmaltzy scenes--let's save the boy from execution, or let's give them bread--don't ring true and instead only make things worse for the "humanity in war" theory. Even worse is the scene between the Russian girl and Witzland. Is she offended because he didn't rape her? Wow. Also, the battle in the snow is unrealistic. Had the Soviets fought like that they would have never won. (when attacked like that you spread out your tanks--not run them into entrenched infantry). But of course the Germans had to win, so they could last to the end of the movie. The best part, the only good one, is the ending, the unlikely trio treading through snow, going nowhere. Had the filmmakers started with that image, concept, and worked backwards this could have been a better flick In all, interesting enough to see once but not enough to remember it. 5.5/10.

At the beginning battle of the movie, the storm company (or battalion?) was tasked to overwhelm the defenders of the factory. The captain wanted to close the quarter quietly and launch the offensive without rousing the defenders. Yet, a rifle was fired unwillingly by an infantry who jumped in, which waked up the defenders and caused a lot of casualties in the attacking force. Later, the captain gave the soldier a hand-grenade to eliminate the machine-gun which is mowing down the German soldiers. That soldier just ran toward the machine-gun without much dodging movements, not even lowering his body. And he didn't get mowed down by the machine-gun. This contradicted the usual common sense. What's more, the German hand-grenade's advantage is its throwing distance, but the explosive in it is not as much as the U.S. fragmentation ones. So I am quite doubtful that a potato-masher would destroy a machine-gun pillbox, as shown in the movie. Plus, Stalingrad would not have gained its nickname "Street-fight Academy" if the defender's position is so easy to overthrow. In the ruins of the Stalingrad, it is impossible to imagine such a single machine-gun pillbox without supporting cross-fire from other directions. If it were that simple, the 6th Army would have captured the city long before the winter began. 2. In the middle of the movie, over the snow-covered steppe, Lieutenant Witzland's platoon is ordered to hold an area where the Russian wanted to break in with their tanks. The soldiers either used Panzerfaust to give the tank a direct hit, or waited in the foxhole until the tank rolled over, and attached the ad-hoc high-explosive to its rear-engine part to break it down. After that, the infantry soldiers attached to the tank or behind it were mowed down by German MP40 or MG42. As far as I know, the usual way of fighting with a mixed mechanized formation is to let the infantry soldiers come forward to scout the hidden enemy fire positions, to expose them and let them be licked up by the up-coming tanks. No, the tanks would never thrust forward by themselves. That way, they would be easy targets for Panzerfausts or Bazookas. The tanks would go all by themselves only in very large formations, say, a tank division or a tank army. In that case, the enemy would not have a chance to come behind the leading tanks and explode them from behind - anyone who tried to do this would be mowed down by the machine-gun in the following-up tanks. In short, the movie is successful in humanizing the German soldiers fighting in Stalingrad, but it made a big mistake in over-simplifying the battle scenes and under-estimating the Russian force too much, just the same errors commit by the Fuhrer and General Staff of Wehrmacht. The Russian would not have won the Battle of Stalingrad if they fought in the way described in the movie.

    A battalion of German soldiers from the Afrika Corps are spending some time at an Italian port during the summer of 1942. At that particular time their spirits were high as the German army was in the process of advancing victoriously into Russia. But all that was subject to change as their next assignment would be: Stalingrad. And they had no idea what was in store for them. At any rate, told from the German perspective, this film does a remarkable job of showing the hardships and tragedy these soldiers had to endure. Despite proving themselves in battle, their courage and discipline was being tested as much by the Russian winter as it was their Russian foes. And yet they continued on all the same. Now, while everybody knows how this battle eventually played out, this movie allows the viewer to gain a unique understanding of how it may have appeared through the eyes of the German soldier. Definitely worth a watch for those who can appreciate a film of this type.

    The battle of Stalingrad is beyond human imagination . It is an event in history that sends a shiver down the spine . Nazi Germany lost one quarter of its total strength on the Eastern front during this one battle . That's if you can even call it a battle , the number of forces involved meant it was more of campaign . And if the scale of the battle wasn't mind numbing enough it's the conditions and ferocity of the fighting that sticks in the mind . As a young schoolboy in the 1970s I vividly remember reading accounts " that every brick in every house in every street was bitterly fought over " . Even in the 21st century with the invasion of Iraq military experts have to emphasise that the capture of Baghdad wouldn't resemble Stalingrad in anyway . In short if you want to visualize war at its most cruel and brutal pick up a history book on Stalingrad . You almost feel sorry for the bad guys . I did say " almost" This is a slight problem with this cinematic account of the battle . STALINGRAD is a very well regarded German film and being a German film it feels the need to make a very clear line between good Germans who are portrayed as the ones who are conscripted in to the Wermacht who do all the fighting and dying in pursuit of Nazi ideals and bad Germans who blindly follow Nazi genocidal laws and never serve in the front line. Even the classic DAS BOOT suffers from this viewpoint . The only film that doesn't portray villains as Nazis is the Anglo German production CROSS OF IRON which has a Prussian aristocrat as the bad German . Would it not be a nice change that Germans murdering innocent people weren't necessarily goose stepping Nazis ? The truth is there were plenty of ordinary Wermacht units implicated in crimes against humanity on the Eastern front in the early 1940s For the majority of the film director Joseph Vilsmaier and screenwriter Jurgen Buscher tend to ignore politics and concentrate on making an anti-war film on a grand epic scale . They succeed too as a battalion of 400 men is quickly drained to a troop of 62 men carrying out full frontal assaults against desperate Soviet defenders . The film makers also make a very important point that Nazi Germany was a Christian nation and include a scene where a padre addresses a congregation emphasising that the Germans have God on their side where as the Bolsheviks are Godless atheists . This scene alone meant I could easily forgive the slight clich&eacute;s that creep in to the film Slight clich&eacute;s are easily forgiven . Unfortunately the more the film goes on the more clich&eacute;s come firing at the audience quicker than a Soviet counter-attack . What become even more unforgivable is the introduction of very contrived plotting as in " Someone must do something unlikely and even more unlikely a character who they already know appears to move the plot forward " A number of people who dislike this movie have pointed out the unlikely coincidences of characters who appeared in the film earlier appear and they're right . It's not enough to destroy the film but a battle on the scale of Stalingrad to have people bumping in to each other the way it happens here strains all credibility . Likewise the final third of the film is rather static where people have existentialist discussions and feels more like a German New Wave film from Rainer Werner Fassbinder In short STALINGRAD is a film I always wanted to see since it was released almost 20 years ago . It was worth the wait . It's a sweeping epic war film and is much praised for the battle sequences . It isn't flawless and unfortunately the flaws are very easy to spot and take issue with . As it stands CROSS OF IRON still remains the best film featuring the carnage and hell of fighting on the Eastern front

    Being a WW2 fan, i was a bit late to see this brilliant movie. Although there are not many movies which are shot in German POV, i find this movie full of uncompromising quality and workmanship. Its visually breathtaking, the battle scenes are brutal and chilling, even the conditions are so unbearable and yet greatly filmed. The Story line is unevenly told and lacks a neat narration. The actions scenes stop abruptly and lacking a final punch. At times, the movie drags on and on. The lead actors are good if not great. I feel that with the kind of brilliant setup the film crew had, they could have shot few more brutal action scenes instead of dragging the whole movie. If you really want to have a very few taste of German sympathy towards Communist counterparts, this is the flick and its aptly shown in bits and pieces.

    I would daresay this is a better war film than 'The Schindler's list'. We have seen many war films from the point of views of Russians, Jews, Poles etc. But this was my first world war 2 movie seen from a German soldier's point of view. The film starts when a battalion of German soldiers are ordered to go to Stalingrad. When they think about going to Stalingrad, they think of farms and greenery but when they reach Stalingrad, the truth is far different than the reality. The German soldiers think they could win Russia within a month, their very notion turns into disbelief as they enter Stalingrad, and see thousands of wounded German soldiers. Stalingrad war was indeed the biggest mistake of Germany, and it proved the beginning of the end for Germany, and resurrection of Russia. One thing I always wondered as a child, when a war is waged why there is no confusion, how always a particular army perfectly distinguishes its soldiers from the opponents'. In the very beginning, when Germans invade Stalingrad, we see a massive confusion within the battalion and a German soldier inadvertently kills his fellow soldier. As you may do research, you will find that there was a huge chaos during the world war 2 and such incidents occurred. One thing that the director wants to convey is that all the German soldiers were not blood grubbing monsters, even they were tired of killing other people, even they wanted to go home. But they had no options, if they didn't kill , they would have been killed by their superiors. This thing is evident when a young Russian boy is captured by the German army, and the soldiers who are protagonists in the movie are told to shoot the boy with dozens of other people. They are reluctant to shoot the boy, but their fascist superior warns them that if they didn't shoot those civilians, they would be next in queue. Stalingrad is an attempt by the director to earn some sympathy for the German soldiers, who were always seen as culprits, but this film shows they were victims too. I don't want to get into the war crimes that Germans committed in Russia and other nations, but when you view a film you have to see it impartially. At the very outset of the film, it is very much clear that you are not going to see a happy end as you see in Hollywood. This film makes 'Enemy at the gates' look a very cheap film which is far from reality, as it creates Rachel Weisz's character in the film. This film is not for the people who want to see war films just for the sake of explosions and killings of people. We see scenes in the film where a German soldier shares his bread with a civilian, and also in the end when the Hans Von Witzland refuses to rape a helpless Russian female soldier. This film tells us about the fate of the soldiers who were stuck there and knew what was coming to them. In fact, this movie tells us about the harsh reality of war and it tells that the war is always bad, and there is no winner in a war. This film doesn't show that Russians were bad despite being a German film, nor it shows that Germans were heroes, but still makes its point of earning sympathy for all the soldiers who lost their lives in the battle of Stalingrad.

    A disappointing movie. There are so many things wrong with Stal. that I could spend this review listing them. First, you have to be aware that certain words carry great promise, a promise that has to be fulfilled at the end or you'll disappoint your audience. Such is the case with "Stalingrad". Most of what's wrong with Stal. comes from the approach the filmmakers took. It's clear they thought that to add up another epic to their resume all they had to do was take inland the crew of Das Boot and put them in the cauldron of Stalingrad. Big mistake. There is an enormous difference of context and nature between both cases. If there was one single "clean" form of war during WWII, at least in the European theater, that was the naval war. There were no Nazi atrocities, no Waffen SS, no Shoah on Atlantic waters, so any German director is free to present his characters as regular sailors doing their duty. But that stops there. Once the action moves to the Eastern front, you cannot possibly keep presenting them under the same light. We do know Germans were the bad guys in the USSR and that's good enough for me, so dramatizations of their suffering and dying over there leave me quite indifferent. I wish German directors stopped presenting their WWII soldiers as just poor guys who got a raw deal, who suffered as much as their victims and who deserve our compassion. Funny thing, I don't see them as such poor saps in stock footage, while they were winning. Also don't talk to me, please, about "humanity in war". There is not such thing and that's the genius of films like Coppola's AN or Malick's TTRL: they show us war as it is, as a brutal, unmitigated, carnage where men lose their souls and become bloodthirsty dogs. In Stalingrad there was no other idea in the minds of all Soviet and German soldiers than to kill as many enemies as they could. Only because of that, Enemy At The Gates is far closer to the historic truth. But the "Das Boot "approach is not only wrong because it distorts the historic truth but also because it deprives the flick of an appropriate set up. The Italian beaches with its relaxing German soldiers--copycat of the Boot's partyrobs the opportunity for a tension creating intro, like the crossing of the Volga and the massacre of Russians in EATG. Those terrible scenes throw you headfirst into the battle, creating a sordid atmosphere which remains for the rest of the flick. You sit in awe for the length of it because you have been shaken to the bones with the raw brutality of it allKhrushchev selecting officers to be shot, Russian soldiers being mowed down like cattle--even more so when you know all, or most, really happened. EATG has been savaged by purists for distorting the historic truth, yet it has the merit of giving us an eloquent picture of what Stalingrad really was. The ever present darkness, the sordid surroundings, the atmosphere of death and decay, the stoic--yet without any illusion about their own survival--snipers. Battle scenes in Stal. instead seem to have been shot on home plate in Yankee Stadium; they are drowning in light, which ruins the atmosphere; its only in the gutter scene that we really get the feel. Also, EATG focuses mostly on a little known, yet fascinating, episode: the battle of the snipers, which makes for a far better packaged movie. Stal. instead wastes miles of film in inane bickering amongst the Germans, in futile conflicts between good and evil (the "evil German" is such a cartoon guy I doubt someone like that ever existed) and in skirmishes that appear staged, probably based on pictures of the real battle. Technically this is not a great flick movie either. The cinematography is standard and the directing so--so. I already mentioned the excess light. The pacing is stilted and the editing terrible. You are suddenly thrown in the midst of battle, not knowing how you got there--and as suddenly the action stops. Also, lack of continuity, some scenes just tacked there for no reason (the Russian woman with her baby). Subplots that keep popping up but lead nowhere (The Russian uncle and soldier for ex.). Stal. could have been better it focused instead on an overview of the whole battle and on Von Paulus' conflicted personality and behavior. The director took a gamble here and lost it; at least amongst those who think the Germans got what they deserved. With it settled, most of the empathy is gone. Schmaltzy scenes--let's save the boy from execution, or let's give them bread--don't ring true and instead only make things worse for the "humanity in war" theory. Even worse is the scene between the Russian girl and Witzland. Is she offended because he didn't rape her? Wow. Also, the battle in the snow is unrealistic. Had the Soviets fought like that they would have never won. (when attacked like that you spread out your tanks--not run them into entrenched infantry). But of course the Germans had to win, so they could last to the end of the movie. The best part, the only good one, is the ending, the unlikely trio treading through snow, going nowhere. Had the filmmakers started with that image, concept, and worked backwards this could have been a better flick In all, interesting enough to see once but not enough to remember it. 5.5/10.

    There was a time when I thought war films were just a bunch of random extras being killed. However when I looked at the ones that weren't American I found that War films can truly grip you and make you say "War is pointless". This is one of those "war is pointless" movies. Before anybody splits hairs in asking how the soldiers are portrayed then I will say something. This movie portrays them as soldiers going through a hellish war, just like the Finnish movie Talvisota (one I would HIGHLY recommend for fans of this movie). For other aspects of the film, it is well acted, the message came across loud and clear, nothing is Hollywood in this movie in terms of portrayal or anything else. I was expecting the ending because the producers were the same people who produced Das Boot For those people that want to see a fantastic war film about the front line should watch this.
