    Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Horst Bucholz, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, and Brad Dexter star as 7 gunfighters who are recruited by Mexican farmers whose village is being terrorized by bandits(led memorably by Eli Wallach) who raid their crops every year, and return nothing. Things don't go as planned, but that doesn't stop our heroes from fighting back... Superbly cast, acted and directed film with a memorable, jaunty score and some surprising insight into the "gunfighter life vs. farmer life" debate. Moves at a good pace, and is a lot of fun. Big hit was followed by sequels and inspired a TV series.

    I took the pain of making this small commentary so that to remember, maybe the future generations, how a classic western is made and if at all this genre should survive. Now first thing first, I put this movie in the list of 10 best movies of all times - I don't care what other people think or say. Second, I want to make an estimate on the artists casting in that movie. If you gather together only the films made by 4 of the participants (Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn) you should see that they made more history in Hollywood than anywhere else on the screen. I lived in a poor European country as a youth (which Bulgaria still is) - but no matter what the standard was, good action cinema was always welcome. So even if the younger generation didn't perceive me well I should reiterate again, I have watched this movie more than 10 times and didn't get bored. It has nothing to do with the several sequels on the same theme but having different actors cast. "Magnificent Seven" - 1 is simply the best because of its stars that play excellent (and its music and directorship): - Yul Brynner, his quickest turnabout that kills Calvera; - Steve McQueen, get wounded but didn't get killed and also a womanizer; - Charles Bronson, big chopper who loved the kids but get killed; - James Coburn, master knife and gun artist but get killed. OK, that's enough. Third, I want to speak about the villain Calvera played by Eli Wallach (a much remembered role in western, maybe only second good after Colorado (Omar Sharif) in "Mackenna's Gold"). Here we see again little man playing big - not because he is like another villain from the story of "Ali Baba and the 40 thieves". In real life Calvera / Wallach outlived all his adversaries (i.e., look at the stars enumerated above) although he was the oldest in age at the feature film. Put this together with another brilliant character in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (where Clint Eastwood was catapulted to stardom) and we have ourselves a man-of-unity. Good for You, Eli!! I wish you good health and to become centeniary. God bless you! P.S. I forgot to mention the several phrases from Calvera's role that impressed me most and I still remember it: - Calvera: Generosity... that was my first mistake. I leave these people a little bit extra, and then they hire these men to make trouble. It shows you, sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed. - Calvera: (dying, to Chris) You came back - for a place like this. Why? A man like you. Why?

    A Hollywood re-imagining of The Seven Samurai comes in a form of a western, sounds pretty good to me. The Magnificent Seven is a fun western flick about protecting a helpless community from bad people. The film is fantastic and deserves to be watched by any western or even an action fan. The film is about a Mexican village hiring seven gunmen to protect them from the bandits who steals their food and crops. The script balances out the action and the character development moments very well. The film fleshes out it's characters and allows us to identify them, I feel this is effective in films with big cast as it makes us care for these people. The film's plot is simple and I think that's what made the film fun as it doesn't try to make you think about anything rather than what is shown in front of you, I know for some people that may be a bad thing but that's just you going in with the wrong mind set. This is the only film so far I have seen from John Sturges, so I didn't really expect anything mindblowing. The film won't be regarded as the best film in the genre but it is definitely a exhilarating ride. It's packed with action and not to the point where it feels repetitive or unnecessary. Sturges has made something accessible and entertaining without sacrificing story and emotion. My expectations for his other films have been raised, "The Great Escape" in particular. The cinematography by Charles Lang, was at times spectacular and sometimes feeling a little generic and typical. It's probably due to the fact that some scenes were limited as the it's shot in a small set or that the film's script doesn't involve a lot of these characters traveling. Sometimes when there are traveling scenes, this is usually a time where they can show off with beautiful cinematography. I did not hate the film's cinematography but I felt it was limited. Elmer Bernstein is a real highlight in this film, it's so memorable and catchy. I have a smile on my face when the theme comes on because I know the seven are gonna do something exciting or important. His score feels like an action film and it helps drive the film along, which is why along with quick editing makes this film feel very fast in it's pace. Bernstein's score is magnificent. The film is not going to be remembered for it's acting but the seven actors are different enough for me to tell which one is which. Yul Brenner was great as this leader and at times is challenged on screen by Steve McQueen. Both McQueen and Brenner work great together, as there is this sense of comradery between them. I love seeing Eli Wallach in films, especially his work on "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly". Wallach plays villains very well as he has this slimy quality to him and at the same time not being over the top with it. The rest of the cast weren't as iconic but they did their parts fine. Like I said, this film isn't known for it's acting so don't try to look for some award winning acting here. Overall the film is fun and entertaining. It does what it does and doesn't try to become deep or anything. An exciting story and wonderful direction makes this an essential western film. If you expect this to be like Sergio Leone where it takes it's time then this may not be what you are looking for but it is damn fun.

    A peace-loving community of Mexican farmers is repeatedly pillaged by dastardly Eli Wallach (as Calvera) and his bandits. The town decides to hire gunslingers to eliminate Mr. Wallach and his gang. Led by brave black-clad Yul Brynner (as Chris Adams), they become known to film viewers as "The Magnificent Seven". Early in the running time, Mr. Brynner picks up super-cool scene-stealer Steve McQueen (as Vin Tanner). The two drifters, from Dodge and Tombstone (wink, nod), attract younger hot-shot Horst Buchholz (as Chico). He gets the girl and most of the remaining screen action... Filling up the seven are Irish-Mexican father figure Charles Bronson (as Bernardo O'Reilly), edgy fugitive Robert Vaughn (as Lee), fortune seeking Brad Dexter (as Harry Luck) and knife wielder James Coburn (as Britt). Producer-director John Sturges looks up at his cast and locks up the landscape remarkably well, although this is obviously not as artful as Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" (1954). The music by Elmer Bernstein is excellent to the point of becoming occasionally distracting. While sometimes lacking, "The Magnificent Seven" is enjoyable as an addendum to the earlier classic. ******* The Magnificent Seven (10/23/60) John Sturges ~ Yul Brynner, Horst Buchholz, Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach

    "The Magnificent Seven" lacks "Seven Samurai"'s critique of rural society, and the characterizations of its heroes are much less pronounced. Artistically and content-wise it falls well short of Kurosawa's masterpiece. Still, it is a worthy example of the liberal-minded "message" Westerns of the 1950s and early 1960s. The opening scene, in which the heroes escort a coffin containing the corpse of a Native American to a cemetery against the wishes of racist and armed townsfolk, sets the tone. Yul Brynner is, as always, fun to watch and to hear, and Eli Wallach is always a treat. The movie's theme music is among the most recognizable in cinema history.

    Every year a Mexican bandit and his large gang of forty thieves harass and plunder a poor farming village south of the American border. They take what they need in provisions from the increasingly impoverished inhabitants. Deciding that enough means ENOUGH (and the wise old man in the village advises that it is DO or DIE), the village elders recruit gunmen from the US to defend them. The actual recruiting of six of the motley crew of gunslingers is done by top American gunman, the grim Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), dressed in black. The wages are only twenty dollars but chow is included, and it is good Mexican food (as the Americans discover). Each one of the defenders has his own reasons for volunteering, and not necessarily as a sense of doing the right thing (one of the men is a soldier of fortune). The men have various talents. For instance, one is a sharpshooter; another is handy with a knife. Much of the film is obviously a build-up to the final confrontation between the "good guys" and the banditos. Outside of the rousing action-packed sequences, this movie has four merits: the actors, the cinematography, Elmer Bernstein's Oscar-nominated music score, and the on-location filming in Mexico. Stars and future stars like Yul Brynner, Charles Bronson, Steve Mc Queen, Robert Vaughn, and James Coburn do not disappoint. Eli Wallach, the future "Tuco," stars as an appropriate pitiless Mexican leader Calvera, who is not without his own concerns. Of course, with so many personalities, actors "battle" for screen time. There is an underlying message in this movie (and in subsequent remakes) that is overlooked: Mexico was a place of anarchy where the federal government could not always keep law and order. John Sturges' western was lifted from Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" (1954), perhaps the greatest movie ever filmed in Japan. In this original version, seven unemployed samurai swordsmen are also hired to fight bandits who terrorize a village. But Kurosawa made a superior film showing the importance of the code of honor of the defenders along with their three-dimensional character development (the film's length was much longer). He even showed a sketch of the Japanese village and the name (or symbols) of each of the bad guys. So when one of them was bumped off, one of the samurai would cross off his name from the bandit list. This helps the audience understand the defensive strategy and what was happening in the battles as the number of the bandits diminished. Nevertheless, "The Magnificent Seven" does stand on its own merits in the heyday of American westerns as a very good movie to enjoy. Even though the pacing is slow, it remains worthwhile watching.

    Being a screenwriter of sorts (i.e. someone who's never sold a screenplay), I've felt a western brewing in my excessively fertile mind. Trouble is, the closest to the Old West I've ever been was a day-trip to the Grand Canyon and while the memory of that trip will last a lifetime, it's not much to base an entire screenplay on. Figuring that a little cinematic research never did anyone a bit of harm (indeed, Quentin Tarantino has made a career of it), I went back to basics with this classic entry into the genre. It may be based on the classic Japanese film "Seven Samurai" but this has all the western clich&eacute;s that fans of the genre will appreciate. A Mexican village is at the mercy of local bandito Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his vicious gang, who ride into town and help themselves to the crops the villagers grow for themselves. After deciding that enough is enough, three of them head into America to buy guns in which to defend themselves. Instead, they meet up with Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) who agrees to help them defend the village instead. Realising that his guns alone won't do, he gradually assembles a posse including knife-man Britt (James Coburn), sharp-shooter Vin (Steve McQueen), sharp-suited Lee (Robert Vaughn) and baby-faced hot-head Chico (Horst Buchholz) among others. The seven of them ride back to the village and prepare them all for the inevitable showdown, each with their own reasons for helping them. Anyone expecting the spit-and-polish of today's movies should probably look elsewhere because "The Magnificent Seven" is chock-full of the sort of over-the-top death staggers involving agonised clutches to the bright red patch on the stomach - you know, the sort of stuff that made westerns old-fashioned in the first place. What it has in reserve is atmosphere and authenticity - the gun battles are remarkably thrilling and exciting as characters dive for whatever cover they can find and stunt-work is impeccable. Performances are also very good - Brynner leads a great cast but weirdly, I never felt that all of the Seven were that well explained. The script doesn't allow the members equal footing and leaves Brynner and McQueen the majority of the lines. But I don't remember any of them having a back story to give themselves depth while Calvera is actually the most understood character on screen, leering and sneering as any baddie in a western should. The other thing a good western needs is a blazing score and Elmer Bernstein's classic theme really is one for the ages, stirring the blood and rousing the spirit in a way that modern films are rarely able to do. This is a film with real energy and a sense of occasion to it, belying its relatively simple story. But with a great cast and direction, it becomes more than a humble western - remember how the "Ocean's Eleven" remake became more than a simple heist flick when you first saw that unbelievable cast list? This is an adventure, a tale of bad men trying to redeem themselves and who can't fall for a story like that? It may stick rigidly to the genre stereotype but "The Magnificent Seven" is still a highly enjoyable film although I cannot compare to the original "Seven Samurai" because I've not seen that. And while westerns remain a niche area of cinema for me, they are inspiring enough to tempt me to have a go at writing one. Just need to remember not to have seven heroes in it...

    This was the first time i had seen this much loved old "classic" from 1960. Some critics felt it ushered in a new style of Western...but in reality, it did the opposite. It ended the card board cut out "heroes" and was replaced by Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood with there anti hero "man with no name". It was a reasonable movie (without the music it would have been limp) to end the fake westerns. It is endlessly said this was full of stars. It was actually full of potential stars (apart from Yul Bryner and Steve McQueen.) We all know it is a copy of Seven Sumarai by Japanese maestro Karosawa (but i am telling you again..!) He said he liked it, but i have a feeling he knew his original version was far superior. Bryner was too laconic here...he is far more effective dancing with Deborah Kerr wearing silly clothes. McQueen spent the first half of the movie trying to distract the audience by any means he could ..."look at me---I am the real star he appeared to be indicating"...maybe he was.

    I generally hate remakes and rarely are they as good as or better than the originals. In the case of "The Magnificent Seven", however, it's a really tough sell because the original was an Akira Kurosawa classic--a film currently in the top 10 on IMDb! So, there really is no way this western can be better...but it still is very good. In particular, the musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the best in the history of westerns and the cast of actors was incredibly--with the likes of Yul Brynner, James Coburn, Steve McQueen and many others as the seven. The film begins in a tiny Mexican town. The villagers are being plundered and harassed by a Mexican gang (led by Eli Wallach). Their choice is to keep knuckling under and starve or leave to get outside help. They decide on the latter and soon a small delegation heads up into the States to find some gunfighters willing to work for VERY little money. Luckily, they find a couple guys who seem to be tired of their lifestyles and want to do something better with their lives (Coburn and Brynner). These two are able to enlist some friends in the cause--no matter how hopeless it looks against an army of 40 men. What happens next, you'll need to see for yourself. What's not to like about this film? Very little. However, as I stated above it was a remake and so it needs to lose a point for originality. In addition, a few of the deaths seemed silly--like folks just wanting to die (especially the first member of the seven). Still, a very enjoyable and well made Hollywood film that is well worth seeing.

    I'm a sucker for this movie. When it shows up on the screen, I'm hooked to the end. Can't add much to others' praise and faults but have noticed two flaws. After the first fight, snipers terrorize the village until nightfall. Brynner and McQueen go looking for them. Later they return triumphant but nothing was shown. Doesn't it seem like a scene's missing? Maybe the film was ruined? At the end of the big climatic scene, Buchholz unhorsing a fleeing bandit to pursue his comrades but there's no follow up there either. Minor matters in an engrossing film. If it's campy now (and must have been a little in 1960, too), it's a feel-good bit of escapism. And the music's perfect.

Artistically and content-wise it falls well short of Kurosawa's masterpiece. Still, it is a worthy example of the liberal-minded "message" Westerns of the 1950s and early 1960s. The opening scene, in which the heroes escort a coffin containing the corpse of a Native American to a cemetery against the wishes of racist and armed townsfolk, sets the tone. Yul Brynner is, as always, fun to watch and to hear, and Eli Wallach is always a treat. The movie's theme music is among the most recognizable in cinema history.

    Every year a Mexican bandit and his large gang of forty thieves harass and plunder a poor farming village south of the American border. They take what they need in provisions from the increasingly impoverished inhabitants. Deciding that enough means ENOUGH (and the wise old man in the village advises that it is DO or DIE), the village elders recruit gunmen from the US to defend them. The actual recruiting of six of the motley crew of gunslingers is done by top American gunman, the grim Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), dressed in black. The wages are only twenty dollars but chow is included, and it is good Mexican food (as the Americans discover). Each one of the defenders has his own reasons for volunteering, and not necessarily as a sense of doing the right thing (one of the men is a soldier of fortune). The men have various talents. For instance, one is a sharpshooter; another is handy with a knife. Much of the film is obviously a build-up to the final confrontation between the "good guys" and the banditos. Outside of the rousing action-packed sequences, this movie has four merits: the actors, the cinematography, Elmer Bernstein's Oscar-nominated music score, and the on-location filming in Mexico. Stars and future stars like Yul Brynner, Charles Bronson, Steve Mc Queen, Robert Vaughn, and James Coburn do not disappoint. Eli Wallach, the future "Tuco," stars as an appropriate pitiless Mexican leader Calvera, who is not without his own concerns. Of course, with so many personalities, actors "battle" for screen time. There is an underlying message in this movie (and in subsequent remakes) that is overlooked: Mexico was a place of anarchy where the federal government could not always keep law and order. John Sturges' western was lifted from Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" (1954), perhaps the greatest movie ever filmed in Japan. In this original version, seven unemployed samurai swordsmen are also hired to fight bandits who terrorize a village. But Kurosawa made a superior film showing the importance of the code of honor of the defenders along with their three-dimensional character development (the film's length was much longer). He even showed a sketch of the Japanese village and the name (or symbols) of each of the bad guys. So when one of them was bumped off, one of the samurai would cross off his name from the bandit list. This helps the audience understand the defensive strategy and what was happening in the battles as the number of the bandits diminished. Nevertheless, "The Magnificent Seven" does stand on its own merits in the heyday of American westerns as a very good movie to enjoy. Even though the pacing is slow, it remains worthwhile watching.

    Being a screenwriter of sorts (i.e. someone who's never sold a screenplay), I've felt a western brewing in my excessively fertile mind. Trouble is, the closest to the Old West I've ever been was a day-trip to the Grand Canyon and while the memory of that trip will last a lifetime, it's not much to base an entire screenplay on. Figuring that a little cinematic research never did anyone a bit of harm (indeed, Quentin Tarantino has made a career of it), I went back to basics with this classic entry into the genre. It may be based on the classic Japanese film "Seven Samurai" but this has all the western clich&eacute;s that fans of the genre will appreciate. A Mexican village is at the mercy of local bandito Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his vicious gang, who ride into town and help themselves to the crops the villagers grow for themselves. After deciding that enough is enough, three of them head into America to buy guns in which to defend themselves. Instead, they meet up with Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) who agrees to help them defend the village instead. Realising that his guns alone won't do, he gradually assembles a posse including knife-man Britt (James Coburn), sharp-shooter Vin (Steve McQueen), sharp-suited Lee (Robert Vaughn) and baby-faced hot-head Chico (Horst Buchholz) among others. The seven of them ride back to the village and prepare them all for the inevitable showdown, each with their own reasons for helping them. Anyone expecting the spit-and-polish of today's movies should probably look elsewhere because "The Magnificent Seven" is chock-full of the sort of over-the-top death staggers involving agonised clutches to the bright red patch on the stomach - you know, the sort of stuff that made westerns old-fashioned in the first place. What it has in reserve is atmosphere and authenticity - the gun battles are remarkably thrilling and exciting as characters dive for whatever cover they can find and stunt-work is impeccable. Performances are also very good - Brynner leads a great cast but weirdly, I never felt that all of the Seven were that well explained. The script doesn't allow the members equal footing and leaves Brynner and McQueen the majority of the lines. But I don't remember any of them having a back story to give themselves depth while Calvera is actually the most understood character on screen, leering and sneering as any baddie in a western should. The other thing a good western needs is a blazing score and Elmer Bernstein's classic theme really is one for the ages, stirring the blood and rousing the spirit in a way that modern films are rarely able to do. This is a film with real energy and a sense of occasion to it, belying its relatively simple story. But with a great cast and direction, it becomes more than a humble western - remember how the "Ocean's Eleven" remake became more than a simple heist flick when you first saw that unbelievable cast list? This is an adventure, a tale of bad men trying to redeem themselves and who can't fall for a story like that? It may stick rigidly to the genre stereotype but "The Magnificent Seven" is still a highly enjoyable film although I cannot compare to the original "Seven Samurai" because I've not seen that. And while westerns remain a niche area of cinema for me, they are inspiring enough to tempt me to have a go at writing one. Just need to remember not to have seven heroes in it...

    This was the first time i had seen this much loved old "classic" from 1960. Some critics felt it ushered in a new style of Western...but in reality, it did the opposite. It ended the card board cut out "heroes" and was replaced by Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood with there anti hero "man with no name". It was a reasonable movie (without the music it would have been limp) to end the fake westerns. It is endlessly said this was full of stars. It was actually full of potential stars (apart from Yul Bryner and Steve McQueen.) We all know it is a copy of Seven Sumarai by Japanese maestro Karosawa (but i am telling you again..!) He said he liked it, but i have a feeling he knew his original version was far superior. Bryner was too laconic here...he is far more effective dancing with Deborah Kerr wearing silly clothes. McQueen spent the first half of the movie trying to distract the audience by any means he could ..."look at me---I am the real star he appeared to be indicating"...maybe he was.

    I generally hate remakes and rarely are they as good as or better than the originals. In the case of "The Magnificent Seven", however, it's a really tough sell because the original was an Akira Kurosawa classic--a film currently in the top 10 on IMDb! So, there really is no way this western can be better...but it still is very good. In particular, the musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the best in the history of westerns and the cast of actors was incredibly--with the likes of Yul Brynner, James Coburn, Steve McQueen and many others as the seven. The film begins in a tiny Mexican town. The villagers are being plundered and harassed by a Mexican gang (led by Eli Wallach). Their choice is to keep knuckling under and starve or leave to get outside help. They decide on the latter and soon a small delegation heads up into the States to find some gunfighters willing to work for VERY little money. Luckily, they find a couple guys who seem to be tired of their lifestyles and want to do something better with their lives (Coburn and Brynner). These two are able to enlist some friends in the cause--no matter how hopeless it looks against an army of 40 men. What happens next, you'll need to see for yourself. What's not to like about this film? Very little. However, as I stated above it was a remake and so it needs to lose a point for originality. In addition, a few of the deaths seemed silly--like folks just wanting to die (especially the first member of the seven). Still, a very enjoyable and well made Hollywood film that is well worth seeing.

    I'm a sucker for this movie. When it shows up on the screen, I'm hooked to the end. Can't add much to others' praise and faults but have noticed two flaws. After the first fight, snipers terrorize the village until nightfall. Brynner and McQueen go looking for them. Later they return triumphant but nothing was shown. Doesn't it seem like a scene's missing? Maybe the film was ruined? At the end of the big climatic scene, Buchholz unhorsing a fleeing bandit to pursue his comrades but there's no follow up there either. Minor matters in an engrossing film. If it's campy now (and must have been a little in 1960, too), it's a feel-good bit of escapism. And the music's perfect.

    Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Horst Bucholz, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, and Brad Dexter star as 7 gunfighters who are recruited by Mexican farmers whose village is being terrorized by bandits(led memorably by Eli Wallach) who raid their crops every year, and return nothing. Things don't go as planned, but that doesn't stop our heroes from fighting back... Superbly cast, acted and directed film with a memorable, jaunty score and some surprising insight into the "gunfighter life vs. farmer life" debate. Moves at a good pace, and is a lot of fun. Big hit was followed by sequels and inspired a TV series.

    I took the pain of making this small commentary so that to remember, maybe the future generations, how a classic western is made and if at all this genre should survive. Now first thing first, I put this movie in the list of 10 best movies of all times - I don't care what other people think or say. Second, I want to make an estimate on the artists casting in that movie. If you gather together only the films made by 4 of the participants (Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn) you should see that they made more history in Hollywood than anywhere else on the screen. I lived in a poor European country as a youth (which Bulgaria still is) - but no matter what the standard was, good action cinema was always welcome. So even if the younger generation didn't perceive me well I should reiterate again, I have watched this movie more than 10 times and didn't get bored. It has nothing to do with the several sequels on the same theme but having different actors cast. "Magnificent Seven" - 1 is simply the best because of its stars that play excellent (and its music and directorship): - Yul Brynner, his quickest turnabout that kills Calvera; - Steve McQueen, get wounded but didn't get killed and also a womanizer; - Charles Bronson, big chopper who loved the kids but get killed; - James Coburn, master knife and gun artist but get killed. OK, that's enough. Third, I want to speak about the villain Calvera played by Eli Wallach (a much remembered role in western, maybe only second good after Colorado (Omar Sharif) in "Mackenna's Gold"). Here we see again little man playing big - not because he is like another villain from the story of "Ali Baba and the 40 thieves". In real life Calvera / Wallach outlived all his adversaries (i.e., look at the stars enumerated above) although he was the oldest in age at the feature film. Put this together with another brilliant character in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (where Clint Eastwood was catapulted to stardom) and we have ourselves a man-of-unity. Good for You, Eli!! I wish you good health and to become centeniary. God bless you! P.S. I forgot to mention the several phrases from Calvera's role that impressed me most and I still remember it: - Calvera: Generosity... that was my first mistake. I leave these people a little bit extra, and then they hire these men to make trouble. It shows you, sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed. - Calvera: (dying, to Chris) You came back - for a place like this. Why? A man like you. Why?

    A Hollywood re-imagining of The Seven Samurai comes in a form of a western, sounds pretty good to me. The Magnificent Seven is a fun western flick about protecting a helpless community from bad people. The film is fantastic and deserves to be watched by any western or even an action fan. The film is about a Mexican village hiring seven gunmen to protect them from the bandits who steals their food and crops. The script balances out the action and the character development moments very well. The film fleshes out it's characters and allows us to identify them, I feel this is effective in films with big cast as it makes us care for these people. The film's plot is simple and I think that's what made the film fun as it doesn't try to make you think about anything rather than what is shown in front of you, I know for some people that may be a bad thing but that's just you going in with the wrong mind set. This is the only film so far I have seen from John Sturges, so I didn't really expect anything mindblowing. The film won't be regarded as the best film in the genre but it is definitely a exhilarating ride. It's packed with action and not to the point where it feels repetitive or unnecessary. Sturges has made something accessible and entertaining without sacrificing story and emotion. My expectations for his other films have been raised, "The Great Escape" in particular. The cinematography by Charles Lang, was at times spectacular and sometimes feeling a little generic and typical. It's probably due to the fact that some scenes were limited as the it's shot in a small set or that the film's script doesn't involve a lot of these characters traveling. Sometimes when there are traveling scenes, this is usually a time where they can show off with beautiful cinematography. I did not hate the film's cinematography but I felt it was limited. Elmer Bernstein is a real highlight in this film, it's so memorable and catchy. I have a smile on my face when the theme comes on because I know the seven are gonna do something exciting or important. His score feels like an action film and it helps drive the film along, which is why along with quick editing makes this film feel very fast in it's pace. Bernstein's score is magnificent. The film is not going to be remembered for it's acting but the seven actors are different enough for me to tell which one is which. Yul Brenner was great as this leader and at times is challenged on screen by Steve McQueen. Both McQueen and Brenner work great together, as there is this sense of comradery between them. I love seeing Eli Wallach in films, especially his work on "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly". Wallach plays villains very well as he has this slimy quality to him and at the same time not being over the top with it. The rest of the cast weren't as iconic but they did their parts fine. Like I said, this film isn't known for it's acting so don't try to look for some award winning acting here. Overall the film is fun and entertaining. It does what it does and doesn't try to become deep or anything. An exciting story and wonderful direction makes this an essential western film. If you expect this to be like Sergio Leone where it takes it's time then this may not be what you are looking for but it is damn fun.

    A peace-loving community of Mexican farmers is repeatedly pillaged by dastardly Eli Wallach (as Calvera) and his bandits. The town decides to hire gunslingers to eliminate Mr. Wallach and his gang. Led by brave black-clad Yul Brynner (as Chris Adams), they become known to film viewers as "The Magnificent Seven". Early in the running time, Mr. Brynner picks up super-cool scene-stealer Steve McQueen (as Vin Tanner). The two drifters, from Dodge and Tombstone (wink, nod), attract younger hot-shot Horst Buchholz (as Chico). He gets the girl and most of the remaining screen action... Filling up the seven are Irish-Mexican father figure Charles Bronson (as Bernardo O'Reilly), edgy fugitive Robert Vaughn (as Lee), fortune seeking Brad Dexter (as Harry Luck) and knife wielder James Coburn (as Britt). Producer-director John Sturges looks up at his cast and locks up the landscape remarkably well, although this is obviously not as artful as Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" (1954). The music by Elmer Bernstein is excellent to the point of becoming occasionally distracting. While sometimes lacking, "The Magnificent Seven" is enjoyable as an addendum to the earlier classic. ******* The Magnificent Seven (10/23/60) John Sturges ~ Yul Brynner, Horst Buchholz, Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach

    Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Horst Bucholz, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, and Brad Dexter star as 7 gunfighters who are recruited by Mexican farmers whose village is being terrorized by bandits(led memorably by Eli Wallach) who raid their crops every year, and return nothing. Things don't go as planned, but that doesn't stop our heroes from fighting back... Superbly cast, acted and directed film with a memorable, jaunty score and some surprising insight into the "gunfighter life vs. farmer life" debate. Moves at a good pace, and is a lot of fun. Big hit was followed by sequels and inspired a TV series.

    I took the pain of making this small commentary so that to remember, maybe the future generations, how a classic western is made and if at all this genre should survive. Now first thing first, I put this movie in the list of 10 best movies of all times - I don't care what other people think or say. Second, I want to make an estimate on the artists casting in that movie. If you gather together only the films made by 4 of the participants (Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn) you should see that they made more history in Hollywood than anywhere else on the screen. I lived in a poor European country as a youth (which Bulgaria still is) - but no matter what the standard was, good action cinema was always welcome. So even if the younger generation didn't perceive me well I should reiterate again, I have watched this movie more than 10 times and didn't get bored. It has nothing to do with the several sequels on the same theme but having different actors cast. "Magnificent Seven" - 1 is simply the best because of its stars that play excellent (and its music and directorship): - Yul Brynner, his quickest turnabout that kills Calvera; - Steve McQueen, get wounded but didn't get killed and also a womanizer; - Charles Bronson, big chopper who loved the kids but get killed; - James Coburn, master knife and gun artist but get killed. OK, that's enough. Third, I want to speak about the villain Calvera played by Eli Wallach (a much remembered role in western, maybe only second good after Colorado (Omar Sharif) in "Mackenna's Gold"). Here we see again little man playing big - not because he is like another villain from the story of "Ali Baba and the 40 thieves". In real life Calvera / Wallach outlived all his adversaries (i.e., look at the stars enumerated above) although he was the oldest in age at the feature film. Put this together with another brilliant character in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (where Clint Eastwood was catapulted to stardom) and we have ourselves a man-of-unity. Good for You, Eli!! I wish you good health and to become centeniary. God bless you! P.S. I forgot to mention the several phrases from Calvera's role that impressed me most and I still remember it: - Calvera: Generosity... that was my first mistake. I leave these people a little bit extra, and then they hire these men to make trouble. It shows you, sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed. - Calvera: (dying, to Chris) You came back - for a place like this. Why? A man like you. Why?

    A Hollywood re-imagining of The Seven Samurai comes in a form of a western, sounds pretty good to me. The Magnificent Seven is a fun western flick about protecting a helpless community from bad people. The film is fantastic and deserves to be watched by any western or even an action fan. The film is about a Mexican village hiring seven gunmen to protect them from the bandits who steals their food and crops. The script balances out the action and the character development moments very well. The film fleshes out it's characters and allows us to identify them, I feel this is effective in films with big cast as it makes us care for these people. The film's plot is simple and I think that's what made the film fun as it doesn't try to make you think about anything rather than what is shown in front of you, I know for some people that may be a bad thing but that's just you going in with the wrong mind set. This is the only film so far I have seen from John Sturges, so I didn't really expect anything mindblowing. The film won't be regarded as the best film in the genre but it is definitely a exhilarating ride. It's packed with action and not to the point where it feels repetitive or unnecessary. Sturges has made something accessible and entertaining without sacrificing story and emotion. My expectations for his other films have been raised, "The Great Escape" in particular. The cinematography by Charles Lang, was at times spectacular and sometimes feeling a little generic and typical. It's probably due to the fact that some scenes were limited as the it's shot in a small set or that the film's script doesn't involve a lot of these characters traveling. Sometimes when there are traveling scenes, this is usually a time where they can show off with beautiful cinematography. I did not hate the film's cinematography but I felt it was limited. Elmer Bernstein is a real highlight in this film, it's so memorable and catchy. I have a smile on my face when the theme comes on because I know the seven are gonna do something exciting or important. His score feels like an action film and it helps drive the film along, which is why along with quick editing makes this film feel very fast in it's pace. Bernstein's score is magnificent. The film is not going to be remembered for it's acting but the seven actors are different enough for me to tell which one is which. Yul Brenner was great as this leader and at times is challenged on screen by Steve McQueen. Both McQueen and Brenner work great together, as there is this sense of comradery between them. I love seeing Eli Wallach in films, especially his work on "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly". Wallach plays villains very well as he has this slimy quality to him and at the same time not being over the top with it. The rest of the cast weren't as iconic but they did their parts fine. Like I said, this film isn't known for it's acting so don't try to look for some award winning acting here. Overall the film is fun and entertaining. It does what it does and doesn't try to become deep or anything. An exciting story and wonderful direction makes this an essential western film. If you expect this to be like Sergio Leone where it takes it's time then this may not be what you are looking for but it is damn fun.

    A peace-loving community of Mexican farmers is repeatedly pillaged by dastardly Eli Wallach (as Calvera) and his bandits. The town decides to hire gunslingers to eliminate Mr. Wallach and his gang. Led by brave black-clad Yul Brynner (as Chris Adams), they become known to film viewers as "The Magnificent Seven". Early in the running time, Mr. Brynner picks up super-cool scene-stealer Steve McQueen (as Vin Tanner). The two drifters, from Dodge and Tombstone (wink, nod), attract younger hot-shot Horst Buchholz (as Chico). He gets the girl and most of the remaining screen action... Filling up the seven are Irish-Mexican father figure Charles Bronson (as Bernardo O'Reilly), edgy fugitive Robert Vaughn (as Lee), fortune seeking Brad Dexter (as Harry Luck) and knife wielder James Coburn (as Britt). Producer-director John Sturges looks up at his cast and locks up the landscape remarkably well, although this is obviously not as artful as Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" (1954). The music by Elmer Bernstein is excellent to the point of becoming occasionally distracting. While sometimes lacking, "The Magnificent Seven" is enjoyable as an addendum to the earlier classic. ******* The Magnificent Seven (10/23/60) John Sturges ~ Yul Brynner, Horst Buchholz, Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach

    "The Magnificent Seven" lacks "Seven Samurai"'s critique of rural society, and the characterizations of its heroes are much less pronounced. Artistically and content-wise it falls well short of Kurosawa's masterpiece. Still, it is a worthy example of the liberal-minded "message" Westerns of the 1950s and early 1960s. The opening scene, in which the heroes escort a coffin containing the corpse of a Native American to a cemetery against the wishes of racist and armed townsfolk, sets the tone. Yul Brynner is, as always, fun to watch and to hear, and Eli Wallach is always a treat. The movie's theme music is among the most recognizable in cinema history.

    Every year a Mexican bandit and his large gang of forty thieves harass and plunder a poor farming village south of the American border. They take what they need in provisions from the increasingly impoverished inhabitants. Deciding that enough means ENOUGH (and the wise old man in the village advises that it is DO or DIE), the village elders recruit gunmen from the US to defend them. The actual recruiting of six of the motley crew of gunslingers is done by top American gunman, the grim Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), dressed in black. The wages are only twenty dollars but chow is included, and it is good Mexican food (as the Americans discover). Each one of the defenders has his own reasons for volunteering, and not necessarily as a sense of doing the right thing (one of the men is a soldier of fortune). The men have various talents. For instance, one is a sharpshooter; another is handy with a knife. Much of the film is obviously a build-up to the final confrontation between the "good guys" and the banditos. Outside of the rousing action-packed sequences, this movie has four merits: the actors, the cinematography, Elmer Bernstein's Oscar-nominated music score, and the on-location filming in Mexico. Stars and future stars like Yul Brynner, Charles Bronson, Steve Mc Queen, Robert Vaughn, and James Coburn do not disappoint. Eli Wallach, the future "Tuco," stars as an appropriate pitiless Mexican leader Calvera, who is not without his own concerns. Of course, with so many personalities, actors "battle" for screen time. There is an underlying message in this movie (and in subsequent remakes) that is overlooked: Mexico was a place of anarchy where the federal government could not always keep law and order. John Sturges' western was lifted from Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" (1954), perhaps the greatest movie ever filmed in Japan. In this original version, seven unemployed samurai swordsmen are also hired to fight bandits who terrorize a village. But Kurosawa made a superior film showing the importance of the code of honor of the defenders along with their three-dimensional character development (the film's length was much longer). He even showed a sketch of the Japanese village and the name (or symbols) of each of the bad guys. So when one of them was bumped off, one of the samurai would cross off his name from the bandit list. This helps the audience understand the defensive strategy and what was happening in the battles as the number of the bandits diminished. Nevertheless, "The Magnificent Seven" does stand on its own merits in the heyday of American westerns as a very good movie to enjoy. Even though the pacing is slow, it remains worthwhile watching.

    Being a screenwriter of sorts (i.e. someone who's never sold a screenplay), I've felt a western brewing in my excessively fertile mind. Trouble is, the closest to the Old West I've ever been was a day-trip to the Grand Canyon and while the memory of that trip will last a lifetime, it's not much to base an entire screenplay on. Figuring that a little cinematic research never did anyone a bit of harm (indeed, Quentin Tarantino has made a career of it), I went back to basics with this classic entry into the genre. It may be based on the classic Japanese film "Seven Samurai" but this has all the western clich&eacute;s that fans of the genre will appreciate. A Mexican village is at the mercy of local bandito Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his vicious gang, who ride into town and help themselves to the crops the villagers grow for themselves. After deciding that enough is enough, three of them head into America to buy guns in which to defend themselves. Instead, they meet up with Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) who agrees to help them defend the village instead. Realising that his guns alone won't do, he gradually assembles a posse including knife-man Britt (James Coburn), sharp-shooter Vin (Steve McQueen), sharp-suited Lee (Robert Vaughn) and baby-faced hot-head Chico (Horst Buchholz) among others. The seven of them ride back to the village and prepare them all for the inevitable showdown, each with their own reasons for helping them. Anyone expecting the spit-and-polish of today's movies should probably look elsewhere because "The Magnificent Seven" is chock-full of the sort of over-the-top death staggers involving agonised clutches to the bright red patch on the stomach - you know, the sort of stuff that made westerns old-fashioned in the first place. What it has in reserve is atmosphere and authenticity - the gun battles are remarkably thrilling and exciting as characters dive for whatever cover they can find and stunt-work is impeccable. Performances are also very good - Brynner leads a great cast but weirdly, I never felt that all of the Seven were that well explained. The script doesn't allow the members equal footing and leaves Brynner and McQueen the majority of the lines. But I don't remember any of them having a back story to give themselves depth while Calvera is actually the most understood character on screen, leering and sneering as any baddie in a western should. The other thing a good western needs is a blazing score and Elmer Bernstein's classic theme really is one for the ages, stirring the blood and rousing the spirit in a way that modern films are rarely able to do. This is a film with real energy and a sense of occasion to it, belying its relatively simple story. But with a great cast and direction, it becomes more than a humble western - remember how the "Ocean's Eleven" remake became more than a simple heist flick when you first saw that unbelievable cast list? This is an adventure, a tale of bad men trying to redeem themselves and who can't fall for a story like that? It may stick rigidly to the genre stereotype but "The Magnificent Seven" is still a highly enjoyable film although I cannot compare to the original "Seven Samurai" because I've not seen that. And while westerns remain a niche area of cinema for me, they are inspiring enough to tempt me to have a go at writing one. Just need to remember not to have seven heroes in it...

    This was the first time i had seen this much loved old "classic" from 1960. Some critics felt it ushered in a new style of Western...but in reality, it did the opposite. It ended the card board cut out "heroes" and was replaced by Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood with there anti hero "man with no name". It was a reasonable movie (without the music it would have been limp) to end the fake westerns. It is endlessly said this was full of stars. It was actually full of potential stars (apart from Yul Bryner and Steve McQueen.) We all know it is a copy of Seven Sumarai by Japanese maestro Karosawa (but i am telling you again..!) He said he liked it, but i have a feeling he knew his original version was far superior. Bryner was too laconic here...he is far more effective dancing with Deborah Kerr wearing silly clothes. McQueen spent the first half of the movie trying to distract the audience by any means he could ..."look at me---I am the real star he appeared to be indicating"...maybe he was.

    I generally hate remakes and rarely are they as good as or better than the originals. In the case of "The Magnificent Seven", however, it's a really tough sell because the original was an Akira Kurosawa classic--a film currently in the top 10 on IMDb! So, there really is no way this western can be better...but it still is very good. In particular, the musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the best in the history of westerns and the cast of actors was incredibly--with the likes of Yul Brynner, James Coburn, Steve McQueen and many others as the seven. The film begins in a tiny Mexican town. The villagers are being plundered and harassed by a Mexican gang (led by Eli Wallach). Their choice is to keep knuckling under and starve or leave to get outside help. They decide on the latter and soon a small delegation heads up into the States to find some gunfighters willing to work for VERY little money. Luckily, they find a couple guys who seem to be tired of their lifestyles and want to do something better with their lives (Coburn and Brynner). These two are able to enlist some friends in the cause--no matter how hopeless it looks against an army of 40 men. What happens next, you'll need to see for yourself. What's not to like about this film? Very little. However, as I stated above it was a remake and so it needs to lose a point for originality. In addition, a few of the deaths seemed silly--like folks just wanting to die (especially the first member of the seven). Still, a very enjoyable and well made Hollywood film that is well worth seeing.

    I'm a sucker for this movie. When it shows up on the screen, I'm hooked to the end. Can't add much to others' praise and faults but have noticed two flaws. After the first fight, snipers terrorize the village until nightfall. Brynner and McQueen go looking for them. Later they return triumphant but nothing was shown. Doesn't it seem like a scene's missing? Maybe the film was ruined? At the end of the big climatic scene, Buchholz unhorsing a fleeing bandit to pursue his comrades but there's no follow up there either. Minor matters in an engrossing film. If it's campy now (and must have been a little in 1960, too), it's a feel-good bit of escapism. And the music's perfect.

There is an underlying message in this movie (and in subsequent remakes) that is overlooked: Mexico was a place of anarchy where the federal government could not always keep law and order. John Sturges' western was lifted from Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" (1954), perhaps the greatest movie ever filmed in Japan. In this original version, seven unemployed samurai swordsmen are also hired to fight bandits who terrorize a village. But Kurosawa made a superior film showing the importance of the code of honor of the defenders along with their three-dimensional character development (the film's length was much longer). He even showed a sketch of the Japanese village and the name (or symbols) of each of the bad guys. So when one of them was bumped off, one of the samurai would cross off his name from the bandit list. This helps the audience understand the defensive strategy and what was happening in the battles as the number of the bandits diminished. Nevertheless, "The Magnificent Seven" does stand on its own merits in the heyday of American westerns as a very good movie to enjoy. Even though the pacing is slow, it remains worthwhile watching.

    Being a screenwriter of sorts (i.e. someone who's never sold a screenplay), I've felt a western brewing in my excessively fertile mind. Trouble is, the closest to the Old West I've ever been was a day-trip to the Grand Canyon and while the memory of that trip will last a lifetime, it's not much to base an entire screenplay on. Figuring that a little cinematic research never did anyone a bit of harm (indeed, Quentin Tarantino has made a career of it), I went back to basics with this classic entry into the genre. It may be based on the classic Japanese film "Seven Samurai" but this has all the western clich&eacute;s that fans of the genre will appreciate. A Mexican village is at the mercy of local bandito Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his vicious gang, who ride into town and help themselves to the crops the villagers grow for themselves. After deciding that enough is enough, three of them head into America to buy guns in which to defend themselves. Instead, they meet up with Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) who agrees to help them defend the village instead. Realising that his guns alone won't do, he gradually assembles a posse including knife-man Britt (James Coburn), sharp-shooter Vin (Steve McQueen), sharp-suited Lee (Robert Vaughn) and baby-faced hot-head Chico (Horst Buchholz) among others. The seven of them ride back to the village and prepare them all for the inevitable showdown, each with their own reasons for helping them. Anyone expecting the spit-and-polish of today's movies should probably look elsewhere because "The Magnificent Seven" is chock-full of the sort of over-the-top death staggers involving agonised clutches to the bright red patch on the stomach - you know, the sort of stuff that made westerns old-fashioned in the first place. What it has in reserve is atmosphere and authenticity - the gun battles are remarkably thrilling and exciting as characters dive for whatever cover they can find and stunt-work is impeccable. Performances are also very good - Brynner leads a great cast but weirdly, I never felt that all of the Seven were that well explained. The script doesn't allow the members equal footing and leaves Brynner and McQueen the majority of the lines. But I don't remember any of them having a back story to give themselves depth while Calvera is actually the most understood character on screen, leering and sneering as any baddie in a western should. The other thing a good western needs is a blazing score and Elmer Bernstein's classic theme really is one for the ages, stirring the blood and rousing the spirit in a way that modern films are rarely able to do. This is a film with real energy and a sense of occasion to it, belying its relatively simple story. But with a great cast and direction, it becomes more than a humble western - remember how the "Ocean's Eleven" remake became more than a simple heist flick when you first saw that unbelievable cast list? This is an adventure, a tale of bad men trying to redeem themselves and who can't fall for a story like that? It may stick rigidly to the genre stereotype but "The Magnificent Seven" is still a highly enjoyable film although I cannot compare to the original "Seven Samurai" because I've not seen that. And while westerns remain a niche area of cinema for me, they are inspiring enough to tempt me to have a go at writing one. Just need to remember not to have seven heroes in it...

    This was the first time i had seen this much loved old "classic" from 1960. Some critics felt it ushered in a new style of Western...but in reality, it did the opposite. It ended the card board cut out "heroes" and was replaced by Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood with there anti hero "man with no name". It was a reasonable movie (without the music it would have been limp) to end the fake westerns. It is endlessly said this was full of stars. It was actually full of potential stars (apart from Yul Bryner and Steve McQueen.) We all know it is a copy of Seven Sumarai by Japanese maestro Karosawa (but i am telling you again..!) He said he liked it, but i have a feeling he knew his original version was far superior. Bryner was too laconic here...he is far more effective dancing with Deborah Kerr wearing silly clothes. McQueen spent the first half of the movie trying to distract the audience by any means he could ..."look at me---I am the real star he appeared to be indicating"...maybe he was.

    I generally hate remakes and rarely are they as good as or better than the originals. In the case of "The Magnificent Seven", however, it's a really tough sell because the original was an Akira Kurosawa classic--a film currently in the top 10 on IMDb! So, there really is no way this western can be better...but it still is very good. In particular, the musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the best in the history of westerns and the cast of actors was incredibly--with the likes of Yul Brynner, James Coburn, Steve McQueen and many others as the seven. The film begins in a tiny Mexican town. The villagers are being plundered and harassed by a Mexican gang (led by Eli Wallach). Their choice is to keep knuckling under and starve or leave to get outside help. They decide on the latter and soon a small delegation heads up into the States to find some gunfighters willing to work for VERY little money. Luckily, they find a couple guys who seem to be tired of their lifestyles and want to do something better with their lives (Coburn and Brynner). These two are able to enlist some friends in the cause--no matter how hopeless it looks against an army of 40 men. What happens next, you'll need to see for yourself. What's not to like about this film? Very little. However, as I stated above it was a remake and so it needs to lose a point for originality. In addition, a few of the deaths seemed silly--like folks just wanting to die (especially the first member of the seven). Still, a very enjoyable and well made Hollywood film that is well worth seeing.

    I'm a sucker for this movie. When it shows up on the screen, I'm hooked to the end. Can't add much to others' praise and faults but have noticed two flaws. After the first fight, snipers terrorize the village until nightfall. Brynner and McQueen go looking for them. Later they return triumphant but nothing was shown. Doesn't it seem like a scene's missing? Maybe the film was ruined? At the end of the big climatic scene, Buchholz unhorsing a fleeing bandit to pursue his comrades but there's no follow up there either. Minor matters in an engrossing film. If it's campy now (and must have been a little in 1960, too), it's a feel-good bit of escapism. And the music's perfect.

    Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Horst Bucholz, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, and Brad Dexter star as 7 gunfighters who are recruited by Mexican farmers whose village is being terrorized by bandits(led memorably by Eli Wallach) who raid their crops every year, and return nothing. Things don't go as planned, but that doesn't stop our heroes from fighting back... Superbly cast, acted and directed film with a memorable, jaunty score and some surprising insight into the "gunfighter life vs. farmer life" debate. Moves at a good pace, and is a lot of fun. Big hit was followed by sequels and inspired a TV series.

    I took the pain of making this small commentary so that to remember, maybe the future generations, how a classic western is made and if at all this genre should survive. Now first thing first, I put this movie in the list of 10 best movies of all times - I don't care what other people think or say. Second, I want to make an estimate on the artists casting in that movie. If you gather together only the films made by 4 of the participants (Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn) you should see that they made more history in Hollywood than anywhere else on the screen. I lived in a poor European country as a youth (which Bulgaria still is) - but no matter what the standard was, good action cinema was always welcome. So even if the younger generation didn't perceive me well I should reiterate again, I have watched this movie more than 10 times and didn't get bored. It has nothing to do with the several sequels on the same theme but having different actors cast. "Magnificent Seven" - 1 is simply the best because of its stars that play excellent (and its music and directorship): - Yul Brynner, his quickest turnabout that kills Calvera; - Steve McQueen, get wounded but didn't get killed and also a womanizer; - Charles Bronson, big chopper who loved the kids but get killed; - James Coburn, master knife and gun artist but get killed. OK, that's enough. Third, I want to speak about the villain Calvera played by Eli Wallach (a much remembered role in western, maybe only second good after Colorado (Omar Sharif) in "Mackenna's Gold"). Here we see again little man playing big - not because he is like another villain from the story of "Ali Baba and the 40 thieves". In real life Calvera / Wallach outlived all his adversaries (i.e., look at the stars enumerated above) although he was the oldest in age at the feature film. Put this together with another brilliant character in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (where Clint Eastwood was catapulted to stardom) and we have ourselves a man-of-unity. Good for You, Eli!! I wish you good health and to become centeniary. God bless you! P.S. I forgot to mention the several phrases from Calvera's role that impressed me most and I still remember it: - Calvera: Generosity... that was my first mistake. I leave these people a little bit extra, and then they hire these men to make trouble. It shows you, sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed. - Calvera: (dying, to Chris) You came back - for a place like this. Why? A man like you. Why?

    A Hollywood re-imagining of The Seven Samurai comes in a form of a western, sounds pretty good to me. The Magnificent Seven is a fun western flick about protecting a helpless community from bad people. The film is fantastic and deserves to be watched by any western or even an action fan. The film is about a Mexican village hiring seven gunmen to protect them from the bandits who steals their food and crops. The script balances out the action and the character development moments very well. The film fleshes out it's characters and allows us to identify them, I feel this is effective in films with big cast as it makes us care for these people. The film's plot is simple and I think that's what made the film fun as it doesn't try to make you think about anything rather than what is shown in front of you, I know for some people that may be a bad thing but that's just you going in with the wrong mind set. This is the only film so far I have seen from John Sturges, so I didn't really expect anything mindblowing. The film won't be regarded as the best film in the genre but it is definitely a exhilarating ride. It's packed with action and not to the point where it feels repetitive or unnecessary. Sturges has made something accessible and entertaining without sacrificing story and emotion. My expectations for his other films have been raised, "The Great Escape" in particular. The cinematography by Charles Lang, was at times spectacular and sometimes feeling a little generic and typical. It's probably due to the fact that some scenes were limited as the it's shot in a small set or that the film's script doesn't involve a lot of these characters traveling. Sometimes when there are traveling scenes, this is usually a time where they can show off with beautiful cinematography. I did not hate the film's cinematography but I felt it was limited. Elmer Bernstein is a real highlight in this film, it's so memorable and catchy. I have a smile on my face when the theme comes on because I know the seven are gonna do something exciting or important. His score feels like an action film and it helps drive the film along, which is why along with quick editing makes this film feel very fast in it's pace. Bernstein's score is magnificent. The film is not going to be remembered for it's acting but the seven actors are different enough for me to tell which one is which. Yul Brenner was great as this leader and at times is challenged on screen by Steve McQueen. Both McQueen and Brenner work great together, as there is this sense of comradery between them. I love seeing Eli Wallach in films, especially his work on "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly". Wallach plays villains very well as he has this slimy quality to him and at the same time not being over the top with it. The rest of the cast weren't as iconic but they did their parts fine. Like I said, this film isn't known for it's acting so don't try to look for some award winning acting here. Overall the film is fun and entertaining. It does what it does and doesn't try to become deep or anything. An exciting story and wonderful direction makes this an essential western film. If you expect this to be like Sergio Leone where it takes it's time then this may not be what you are looking for but it is damn fun.

    A peace-loving community of Mexican farmers is repeatedly pillaged by dastardly Eli Wallach (as Calvera) and his bandits. The town decides to hire gunslingers to eliminate Mr. Wallach and his gang. Led by brave black-clad Yul Brynner (as Chris Adams), they become known to film viewers as "The Magnificent Seven". Early in the running time, Mr. Brynner picks up super-cool scene-stealer Steve McQueen (as Vin Tanner). The two drifters, from Dodge and Tombstone (wink, nod), attract younger hot-shot Horst Buchholz (as Chico). He gets the girl and most of the remaining screen action... Filling up the seven are Irish-Mexican father figure Charles Bronson (as Bernardo O'Reilly), edgy fugitive Robert Vaughn (as Lee), fortune seeking Brad Dexter (as Harry Luck) and knife wielder James Coburn (as Britt). Producer-director John Sturges looks up at his cast and locks up the landscape remarkably well, although this is obviously not as artful as Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" (1954). The music by Elmer Bernstein is excellent to the point of becoming occasionally distracting. While sometimes lacking, "The Magnificent Seven" is enjoyable as an addendum to the earlier classic. ******* The Magnificent Seven (10/23/60) John Sturges ~ Yul Brynner, Horst Buchholz, Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach

    "The Magnificent Seven" lacks "Seven Samurai"'s critique of rural society, and the characterizations of its heroes are much less pronounced. Artistically and content-wise it falls well short of Kurosawa's masterpiece. Still, it is a worthy example of the liberal-minded "message" Westerns of the 1950s and early 1960s. The opening scene, in which the heroes escort a coffin containing the corpse of a Native American to a cemetery against the wishes of racist and armed townsfolk, sets the tone. Yul Brynner is, as always, fun to watch and to hear, and Eli Wallach is always a treat. The movie's theme music is among the most recognizable in cinema history.

    Every year a Mexican bandit and his large gang of forty thieves harass and plunder a poor farming village south of the American border. They take what they need in provisions from the increasingly impoverished inhabitants. Deciding that enough means ENOUGH (and the wise old man in the village advises that it is DO or DIE), the village elders recruit gunmen from the US to defend them. The actual recruiting of six of the motley crew of gunslingers is done by top American gunman, the grim Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), dressed in black. The wages are only twenty dollars but chow is included, and it is good Mexican food (as the Americans discover). Each one of the defenders has his own reasons for volunteering, and not necessarily as a sense of doing the right thing (one of the men is a soldier of fortune). The men have various talents. For instance, one is a sharpshooter; another is handy with a knife. Much of the film is obviously a build-up to the final confrontation between the "good guys" and the banditos. Outside of the rousing action-packed sequences, this movie has four merits: the actors, the cinematography, Elmer Bernstein's Oscar-nominated music score, and the on-location filming in Mexico. Stars and future stars like Yul Brynner, Charles Bronson, Steve Mc Queen, Robert Vaughn, and James Coburn do not disappoint. Eli Wallach, the future "Tuco," stars as an appropriate pitiless Mexican leader Calvera, who is not without his own concerns. Of course, with so many personalities, actors "battle" for screen time. There is an underlying message in this movie (and in subsequent remakes) that is overlooked: Mexico was a place of anarchy where the federal government could not always keep law and order.

"Magnificent Seven" - 1 is simply the best because of its stars that play excellent (and its music and directorship): - Yul Brynner, his quickest turnabout that kills Calvera; - Steve McQueen, get wounded but didn't get killed and also a womanizer; - Charles Bronson, big chopper who loved the kids but get killed; - James Coburn, master knife and gun artist but get killed. OK, that's enough. Third, I want to speak about the villain Calvera played by Eli Wallach (a much remembered role in western, maybe only second good after Colorado (Omar Sharif) in "Mackenna's Gold"). Here we see again little man playing big - not because he is like another villain from the story of "Ali Baba and the 40 thieves". In real life Calvera / Wallach outlived all his adversaries (i.e., look at the stars enumerated above) although he was the oldest in age at the feature film. Put this together with another brilliant character in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (where Clint Eastwood was catapulted to stardom) and we have ourselves a man-of-unity. Good for You, Eli!! I wish you good health and to become centeniary. God bless you! P.S. I forgot to mention the several phrases from Calvera's role that impressed me most and I still remember it: - Calvera: Generosity... that was my first mistake. I leave these people a little bit extra, and then they hire these men to make trouble. It shows you, sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed. - Calvera: (dying, to Chris) You came back - for a place like this. Why? A man like you. Why?

    A Hollywood re-imagining of The Seven Samurai comes in a form of a western, sounds pretty good to me. The Magnificent Seven is a fun western flick about protecting a helpless community from bad people. The film is fantastic and deserves to be watched by any western or even an action fan. The film is about a Mexican village hiring seven gunmen to protect them from the bandits who steals their food and crops. The script balances out the action and the character development moments very well. The film fleshes out it's characters and allows us to identify them, I feel this is effective in films with big cast as it makes us care for these people. The film's plot is simple and I think that's what made the film fun as it doesn't try to make you think about anything rather than what is shown in front of you, I know for some people that may be a bad thing but that's just you going in with the wrong mind set. This is the only film so far I have seen from John Sturges, so I didn't really expect anything mindblowing. The film won't be regarded as the best film in the genre but it is definitely a exhilarating ride. It's packed with action and not to the point where it feels repetitive or unnecessary. Sturges has made something accessible and entertaining without sacrificing story and emotion. My expectations for his other films have been raised, "The Great Escape" in particular. The cinematography by Charles Lang, was at times spectacular and sometimes feeling a little generic and typical. It's probably due to the fact that some scenes were limited as the it's shot in a small set or that the film's script doesn't involve a lot of these characters traveling. Sometimes when there are traveling scenes, this is usually a time where they can show off with beautiful cinematography. I did not hate the film's cinematography but I felt it was limited. Elmer Bernstein is a real highlight in this film, it's so memorable and catchy. I have a smile on my face when the theme comes on because I know the seven are gonna do something exciting or important. His score feels like an action film and it helps drive the film along, which is why along with quick editing makes this film feel very fast in it's pace. Bernstein's score is magnificent. The film is not going to be remembered for it's acting but the seven actors are different enough for me to tell which one is which. Yul Brenner was great as this leader and at times is challenged on screen by Steve McQueen. Both McQueen and Brenner work great together, as there is this sense of comradery between them. I love seeing Eli Wallach in films, especially his work on "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly". Wallach plays villains very well as he has this slimy quality to him and at the same time not being over the top with it. The rest of the cast weren't as iconic but they did their parts fine. Like I said, this film isn't known for it's acting so don't try to look for some award winning acting here. Overall the film is fun and entertaining. It does what it does and doesn't try to become deep or anything. An exciting story and wonderful direction makes this an essential western film. If you expect this to be like Sergio Leone where it takes it's time then this may not be what you are looking for but it is damn fun.

    A peace-loving community of Mexican farmers is repeatedly pillaged by dastardly Eli Wallach (as Calvera) and his bandits. The town decides to hire gunslingers to eliminate Mr. Wallach and his gang. Led by brave black-clad Yul Brynner (as Chris Adams), they become known to film viewers as "The Magnificent Seven". Early in the running time, Mr. Brynner picks up super-cool scene-stealer Steve McQueen (as Vin Tanner). The two drifters, from Dodge and Tombstone (wink, nod), attract younger hot-shot Horst Buchholz (as Chico). He gets the girl and most of the remaining screen action... Filling up the seven are Irish-Mexican father figure Charles Bronson (as Bernardo O'Reilly), edgy fugitive Robert Vaughn (as Lee), fortune seeking Brad Dexter (as Harry Luck) and knife wielder James Coburn (as Britt). Producer-director John Sturges looks up at his cast and locks up the landscape remarkably well, although this is obviously not as artful as Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" (1954). The music by Elmer Bernstein is excellent to the point of becoming occasionally distracting. While sometimes lacking, "The Magnificent Seven" is enjoyable as an addendum to the earlier classic. ******* The Magnificent Seven (10/23/60) John Sturges ~ Yul Brynner, Horst Buchholz, Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach

    "The Magnificent Seven" lacks "Seven Samurai"'s critique of rural society, and the characterizations of its heroes are much less pronounced. Artistically and content-wise it falls well short of Kurosawa's masterpiece. Still, it is a worthy example of the liberal-minded "message" Westerns of the 1950s and early 1960s. The opening scene, in which the heroes escort a coffin containing the corpse of a Native American to a cemetery against the wishes of racist and armed townsfolk, sets the tone. Yul Brynner is, as always, fun to watch and to hear, and Eli Wallach is always a treat. The movie's theme music is among the most recognizable in cinema history.

    Every year a Mexican bandit and his large gang of forty thieves harass and plunder a poor farming village south of the American border. They take what they need in provisions from the increasingly impoverished inhabitants. Deciding that enough means ENOUGH (and the wise old man in the village advises that it is DO or DIE), the village elders recruit gunmen from the US to defend them. The actual recruiting of six of the motley crew of gunslingers is done by top American gunman, the grim Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), dressed in black. The wages are only twenty dollars but chow is included, and it is good Mexican food (as the Americans discover). Each one of the defenders has his own reasons for volunteering, and not necessarily as a sense of doing the right thing (one of the men is a soldier of fortune). The men have various talents. For instance, one is a sharpshooter; another is handy with a knife. Much of the film is obviously a build-up to the final confrontation between the "good guys" and the banditos. Outside of the rousing action-packed sequences, this movie has four merits: the actors, the cinematography, Elmer Bernstein's Oscar-nominated music score, and the on-location filming in Mexico. Stars and future stars like Yul Brynner, Charles Bronson, Steve Mc Queen, Robert Vaughn, and James Coburn do not disappoint. Eli Wallach, the future "Tuco," stars as an appropriate pitiless Mexican leader Calvera, who is not without his own concerns. Of course, with so many personalities, actors "battle" for screen time. There is an underlying message in this movie (and in subsequent remakes) that is overlooked: Mexico was a place of anarchy where the federal government could not always keep law and order. John Sturges' western was lifted from Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" (1954), perhaps the greatest movie ever filmed in Japan. In this original version, seven unemployed samurai swordsmen are also hired to fight bandits who terrorize a village. But Kurosawa made a superior film showing the importance of the code of honor of the defenders along with their three-dimensional character development (the film's length was much longer). He even showed a sketch of the Japanese village and the name (or symbols) of each of the bad guys. So when one of them was bumped off, one of the samurai would cross off his name from the bandit list. This helps the audience understand the defensive strategy and what was happening in the battles as the number of the bandits diminished. Nevertheless, "The Magnificent Seven" does stand on its own merits in the heyday of American westerns as a very good movie to enjoy. Even though the pacing is slow, it remains worthwhile watching.

    Being a screenwriter of sorts (i.e. someone who's never sold a screenplay), I've felt a western brewing in my excessively fertile mind. Trouble is, the closest to the Old West I've ever been was a day-trip to the Grand Canyon and while the memory of that trip will last a lifetime, it's not much to base an entire screenplay on. Figuring that a little cinematic research never did anyone a bit of harm (indeed, Quentin Tarantino has made a career of it), I went back to basics with this classic entry into the genre. It may be based on the classic Japanese film "Seven Samurai" but this has all the western clich&eacute;s that fans of the genre will appreciate. A Mexican village is at the mercy of local bandito Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his vicious gang, who ride into town and help themselves to the crops the villagers grow for themselves. After deciding that enough is enough, three of them head into America to buy guns in which to defend themselves. Instead, they meet up with Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) who agrees to help them defend the village instead. Realising that his guns alone won't do, he gradually assembles a posse including knife-man Britt (James Coburn), sharp-shooter Vin (Steve McQueen), sharp-suited Lee (Robert Vaughn) and baby-faced hot-head Chico (Horst Buchholz) among others. The seven of them ride back to the village and prepare them all for the inevitable showdown, each with their own reasons for helping them. Anyone expecting the spit-and-polish of today's movies should probably look elsewhere because "The Magnificent Seven" is chock-full of the sort of over-the-top death staggers involving agonised clutches to the bright red patch on the stomach - you know, the sort of stuff that made westerns old-fashioned in the first place. What it has in reserve is atmosphere and authenticity - the gun battles are remarkably thrilling and exciting as characters dive for whatever cover they can find and stunt-work is impeccable. Performances are also very good - Brynner leads a great cast but weirdly, I never felt that all of the Seven were that well explained. The script doesn't allow the members equal footing and leaves Brynner and McQueen the majority of the lines. But I don't remember any of them having a back story to give themselves depth while Calvera is actually the most understood character on screen, leering and sneering as any baddie in a western should. The other thing a good western needs is a blazing score and Elmer Bernstein's classic theme really is one for the ages, stirring the blood and rousing the spirit in a way that modern films are rarely able to do. This is a film with real energy and a sense of occasion to it, belying its relatively simple story. But with a great cast and direction, it becomes more than a humble western - remember how the "Ocean's Eleven" remake became more than a simple heist flick when you first saw that unbelievable cast list? This is an adventure, a tale of bad men trying to redeem themselves and who can't fall for a story like that? It may stick rigidly to the genre stereotype but "The Magnificent Seven" is still a highly enjoyable film although I cannot compare to the original "Seven Samurai" because I've not seen that. And while westerns remain a niche area of cinema for me, they are inspiring enough to tempt me to have a go at writing one. Just need to remember not to have seven heroes in it...

    This was the first time i had seen this much loved old "classic" from 1960. Some critics felt it ushered in a new style of Western...but in reality, it did the opposite. It ended the card board cut out "heroes" and was replaced by Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood with there anti hero "man with no name". It was a reasonable movie (without the music it would have been limp) to end the fake westerns. It is endlessly said this was full of stars. It was actually full of potential stars (apart from Yul Bryner and Steve McQueen.) We all know it is a copy of Seven Sumarai by Japanese maestro Karosawa (but i am telling you again..!) He said he liked it, but i have a feeling he knew his original version was far superior. Bryner was too laconic here...he is far more effective dancing with Deborah Kerr wearing silly clothes. McQueen spent the first half of the movie trying to distract the audience by any means he could ..."look at me---I am the real star he appeared to be indicating"...maybe he was.

    I generally hate remakes and rarely are they as good as or better than the originals. In the case of "The Magnificent Seven", however, it's a really tough sell because the original was an Akira Kurosawa classic--a film currently in the top 10 on IMDb! So, there really is no way this western can be better...but it still is very good. In particular, the musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the best in the history of westerns and the cast of actors was incredibly--with the likes of Yul Brynner, James Coburn, Steve McQueen and many others as the seven. The film begins in a tiny Mexican town. The villagers are being plundered and harassed by a Mexican gang (led by Eli Wallach). Their choice is to keep knuckling under and starve or leave to get outside help. They decide on the latter and soon a small delegation heads up into the States to find some gunfighters willing to work for VERY little money. Luckily, they find a couple guys who seem to be tired of their lifestyles and want to do something better with their lives (Coburn and Brynner). These two are able to enlist some friends in the cause--no matter how hopeless it looks against an army of 40 men. What happens next, you'll need to see for yourself. What's not to like about this film? Very little. However, as I stated above it was a remake and so it needs to lose a point for originality. In addition, a few of the deaths seemed silly--like folks just wanting to die (especially the first member of the seven). Still, a very enjoyable and well made Hollywood film that is well worth seeing.

    I'm a sucker for this movie. When it shows up on the screen, I'm hooked to the end. Can't add much to others' praise and faults but have noticed two flaws. After the first fight, snipers terrorize the village until nightfall. Brynner and McQueen go looking for them. Later they return triumphant but nothing was shown. Doesn't it seem like a scene's missing? Maybe the film was ruined? At the end of the big climatic scene, Buchholz unhorsing a fleeing bandit to pursue his comrades but there's no follow up there either. Minor matters in an engrossing film. If it's campy now (and must have been a little in 1960, too), it's a feel-good bit of escapism. And the music's perfect.

    Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Horst Bucholz, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, and Brad Dexter star as 7 gunfighters who are recruited by Mexican farmers whose village is being terrorized by bandits(led memorably by Eli Wallach) who raid their crops every year, and return nothing. Things don't go as planned, but that doesn't stop our heroes from fighting back... Superbly cast, acted and directed film with a memorable, jaunty score and some surprising insight into the "gunfighter life vs. farmer life" debate. Moves at a good pace, and is a lot of fun. Big hit was followed by sequels and inspired a TV series.

    I took the pain of making this small commentary so that to remember, maybe the future generations, how a classic western is made and if at all this genre should survive. Now first thing first, I put this movie in the list of 10 best movies of all times - I don't care what other people think or say. Second, I want to make an estimate on the artists casting in that movie. If you gather together only the films made by 4 of the participants (Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn) you should see that they made more history in Hollywood than anywhere else on the screen. I lived in a poor European country as a youth (which Bulgaria still is) - but no matter what the standard was, good action cinema was always welcome. So even if the younger generation didn't perceive me well I should reiterate again, I have watched this movie more than 10 times and didn't get bored. It has nothing to do with the several sequels on the same theme but having different actors cast. "Magnificent Seven" - 1 is simply the best because of its stars that play excellent (and its music and directorship): - Yul Brynner, his quickest turnabout that kills Calvera; - Steve McQueen, get wounded but didn't get killed and also a womanizer; - Charles Bronson, big chopper who loved the kids but get killed; - James Coburn, master knife and gun artist but get killed. OK, that's enough. Third, I want to speak about the villain Calvera played by Eli Wallach (a much remembered role in western, maybe only second good after Colorado (Omar Sharif) in "Mackenna's Gold"). Here we see again little man playing big - not because he is like another villain from the story of "Ali Baba and the 40 thieves".

I leave these people a little bit extra, and then they hire these men to make trouble.

It may be based on the classic Japanese film "Seven Samurai" but this has all the western clich&eacute;s that fans of the genre will appreciate. A Mexican village is at the mercy of local bandito Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his vicious gang, who ride into town and help themselves to the crops the villagers grow for themselves. After deciding that enough is enough, three of them head into America to buy guns in which to defend themselves. Instead, they meet up with Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) who agrees to help them defend the village instead. Realising that his guns alone won't do, he gradually assembles a posse including knife-man Britt (James Coburn), sharp-shooter Vin (Steve McQueen), sharp-suited Lee (Robert Vaughn) and baby-faced hot-head Chico (Horst Buchholz) among others. The seven of them ride back to the village and prepare them all for the inevitable showdown, each with their own reasons for helping them. Anyone expecting the spit-and-polish of today's movies should probably look elsewhere because "The Magnificent Seven" is chock-full of the sort of over-the-top death staggers involving agonised clutches to the bright red patch on the stomach - you know, the sort of stuff that made westerns old-fashioned in the first place. What it has in reserve is atmosphere and authenticity - the gun battles are remarkably thrilling and exciting as characters dive for whatever cover they can find and stunt-work is impeccable. Performances are also very good - Brynner leads a great cast but weirdly, I never felt that all of the Seven were that well explained. The script doesn't allow the members equal footing and leaves Brynner and McQueen the majority of the lines. But I don't remember any of them having a back story to give themselves depth while Calvera is actually the most understood character on screen, leering and sneering as any baddie in a western should. The other thing a good western needs is a blazing score and Elmer Bernstein's classic theme really is one for the ages, stirring the blood and rousing the spirit in a way that modern films are rarely able to do. This is a film with real energy and a sense of occasion to it, belying its relatively simple story. But with a great cast and direction, it becomes more than a humble western - remember how the "Ocean's Eleven" remake became more than a simple heist flick when you first saw that unbelievable cast list? This is an adventure, a tale of bad men trying to redeem themselves and who can't fall for a story like that? It may stick rigidly to the genre stereotype but "The Magnificent Seven" is still a highly enjoyable film although I cannot compare to the original "Seven Samurai" because I've not seen that. And while westerns remain a niche area of cinema for me, they are inspiring enough to tempt me to have a go at writing one. Just need to remember not to have seven heroes in it...

    This was the first time i had seen this much loved old "classic" from 1960. Some critics felt it ushered in a new style of Western...but in reality, it did the opposite. It ended the card board cut out "heroes" and was replaced by Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood with there anti hero "man with no name". It was a reasonable movie (without the music it would have been limp) to end the fake westerns. It is endlessly said this was full of stars. It was actually full of potential stars (apart from Yul Bryner and Steve McQueen.) We all know it is a copy of Seven Sumarai by Japanese maestro Karosawa (but i am telling you again..!) He said he liked it, but i have a feeling he knew his original version was far superior. Bryner was too laconic here...he is far more effective dancing with Deborah Kerr wearing silly clothes. McQueen spent the first half of the movie trying to distract the audience by any means he could ..."look at me---I am the real star he appeared to be indicating"...maybe he was.

    I generally hate remakes and rarely are they as good as or better than the originals. In the case of "The Magnificent Seven", however, it's a really tough sell because the original was an Akira Kurosawa classic--a film currently in the top 10 on IMDb! So, there really is no way this western can be better...but it still is very good. In particular, the musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the best in the history of westerns and the cast of actors was incredibly--with the likes of Yul Brynner, James Coburn, Steve McQueen and many others as the seven. The film begins in a tiny Mexican town. The villagers are being plundered and harassed by a Mexican gang (led by Eli Wallach). Their choice is to keep knuckling under and starve or leave to get outside help. They decide on the latter and soon a small delegation heads up into the States to find some gunfighters willing to work for VERY little money. Luckily, they find a couple guys who seem to be tired of their lifestyles and want to do something better with their lives (Coburn and Brynner). These two are able to enlist some friends in the cause--no matter how hopeless it looks against an army of 40 men. What happens next, you'll need to see for yourself. What's not to like about this film? Very little. However, as I stated above it was a remake and so it needs to lose a point for originality. In addition, a few of the deaths seemed silly--like folks just wanting to die (especially the first member of the seven). Still, a very enjoyable and well made Hollywood film that is well worth seeing.

    I'm a sucker for this movie. When it shows up on the screen, I'm hooked to the end. Can't add much to others' praise and faults but have noticed two flaws. After the first fight, snipers terrorize the village until nightfall. Brynner and McQueen go looking for them. Later they return triumphant but nothing was shown. Doesn't it seem like a scene's missing? Maybe the film was ruined? At the end of the big climatic scene, Buchholz unhorsing a fleeing bandit to pursue his comrades but there's no follow up there either. Minor matters in an engrossing film. If it's campy now (and must have been a little in 1960, too), it's a feel-good bit of escapism. And the music's perfect.

    Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Horst Bucholz, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, and Brad Dexter star as 7 gunfighters who are recruited by Mexican farmers whose village is being terrorized by bandits(led memorably by Eli Wallach) who raid their crops every year, and return nothing. Things don't go as planned, but that doesn't stop our heroes from fighting back... Superbly cast, acted and directed film with a memorable, jaunty score and some surprising insight into the "gunfighter life vs. farmer life" debate. Moves at a good pace, and is a lot of fun. Big hit was followed by sequels and inspired a TV series.

    I took the pain of making this small commentary so that to remember, maybe the future generations, how a classic western is made and if at all this genre should survive. Now first thing first, I put this movie in the list of 10 best movies of all times - I don't care what other people think or say. Second, I want to make an estimate on the artists casting in that movie. If you gather together only the films made by 4 of the participants (Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn) you should see that they made more history in Hollywood than anywhere else on the screen. I lived in a poor European country as a youth (which Bulgaria still is) - but no matter what the standard was, good action cinema was always welcome. So even if the younger generation didn't perceive me well I should reiterate again, I have watched this movie more than 10 times and didn't get bored. It has nothing to do with the several sequels on the same theme but having different actors cast. "Magnificent Seven" - 1 is simply the best because of its stars that play excellent (and its music and directorship): - Yul Brynner, his quickest turnabout that kills Calvera; - Steve McQueen, get wounded but didn't get killed and also a womanizer; - Charles Bronson, big chopper who loved the kids but get killed; - James Coburn, master knife and gun artist but get killed. OK, that's enough. Third, I want to speak about the villain Calvera played by Eli Wallach (a much remembered role in western, maybe only second good after Colorado (Omar Sharif) in "Mackenna's Gold"). Here we see again little man playing big - not because he is like another villain from the story of "Ali Baba and the 40 thieves". In real life Calvera / Wallach outlived all his adversaries (i.e., look at the stars enumerated above) although he was the oldest in age at the feature film. Put this together with another brilliant character in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (where Clint Eastwood was catapulted to stardom) and we have ourselves a man-of-unity. Good for You, Eli!! I wish you good health and to become centeniary. God bless you! P.S. I forgot to mention the several phrases from Calvera's role that impressed me most and I still remember it: - Calvera: Generosity... that was my first mistake. I leave these people a little bit extra, and then they hire these men to make trouble. It shows you, sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed. - Calvera: (dying, to Chris) You came back - for a place like this. Why? A man like you. Why?

    A Hollywood re-imagining of The Seven Samurai comes in a form of a western, sounds pretty good to me. The Magnificent Seven is a fun western flick about protecting a helpless community from bad people. The film is fantastic and deserves to be watched by any western or even an action fan. The film is about a Mexican village hiring seven gunmen to protect them from the bandits who steals their food and crops. The script balances out the action and the character development moments very well. The film fleshes out it's characters and allows us to identify them, I feel this is effective in films with big cast as it makes us care for these people. The film's plot is simple and I think that's what made the film fun as it doesn't try to make you think about anything rather than what is shown in front of you, I know for some people that may be a bad thing but that's just you going in with the wrong mind set. This is the only film so far I have seen from John Sturges, so I didn't really expect anything mindblowing. The film won't be regarded as the best film in the genre but it is definitely a exhilarating ride. It's packed with action and not to the point where it feels repetitive or unnecessary. Sturges has made something accessible and entertaining without sacrificing story and emotion. My expectations for his other films have been raised, "The Great Escape" in particular. The cinematography by Charles Lang, was at times spectacular and sometimes feeling a little generic and typical. It's probably due to the fact that some scenes were limited as the it's shot in a small set or that the film's script doesn't involve a lot of these characters traveling. Sometimes when there are traveling scenes, this is usually a time where they can show off with beautiful cinematography. I did not hate the film's cinematography but I felt it was limited. Elmer Bernstein is a real highlight in this film, it's so memorable and catchy. I have a smile on my face when the theme comes on because I know the seven are gonna do something exciting or important. His score feels like an action film and it helps drive the film along, which is why along with quick editing makes this film feel very fast in it's pace. Bernstein's score is magnificent. The film is not going to be remembered for it's acting but the seven actors are different enough for me to tell which one is which. Yul Brenner was great as this leader and at times is challenged on screen by Steve McQueen. Both McQueen and Brenner work great together, as there is this sense of comradery between them. I love seeing Eli Wallach in films, especially his work on "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly". Wallach plays villains very well as he has this slimy quality to him and at the same time not being over the top with it. The rest of the cast weren't as iconic but they did their parts fine. Like I said, this film isn't known for it's acting so don't try to look for some award winning acting here. Overall the film is fun and entertaining. It does what it does and doesn't try to become deep or anything. An exciting story and wonderful direction makes this an essential western film. If you expect this to be like Sergio Leone where it takes it's time then this may not be what you are looking for but it is damn fun.

    A peace-loving community of Mexican farmers is repeatedly pillaged by dastardly Eli Wallach (as Calvera) and his bandits. The town decides to hire gunslingers to eliminate Mr. Wallach and his gang. Led by brave black-clad Yul Brynner (as Chris Adams), they become known to film viewers as "The Magnificent Seven". Early in the running time, Mr. Brynner picks up super-cool scene-stealer Steve McQueen (as Vin Tanner). The two drifters, from Dodge and Tombstone (wink, nod), attract younger hot-shot Horst Buchholz (as Chico). He gets the girl and most of the remaining screen action... Filling up the seven are Irish-Mexican father figure Charles Bronson (as Bernardo O'Reilly), edgy fugitive Robert Vaughn (as Lee), fortune seeking Brad Dexter (as Harry Luck) and knife wielder James Coburn (as Britt). Producer-director John Sturges looks up at his cast and locks up the landscape remarkably well, although this is obviously not as artful as Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" (1954). The music by Elmer Bernstein is excellent to the point of becoming occasionally distracting. While sometimes lacking, "The Magnificent Seven" is enjoyable as an addendum to the earlier classic. ******* The Magnificent Seven (10/23/60) John Sturges ~ Yul Brynner, Horst Buchholz, Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach

    "The Magnificent Seven" lacks "Seven Samurai"'s critique of rural society, and the characterizations of its heroes are much less pronounced. Artistically and content-wise it falls well short of Kurosawa's masterpiece. Still, it is a worthy example of the liberal-minded "message" Westerns of the 1950s and early 1960s. The opening scene, in which the heroes escort a coffin containing the corpse of a Native American to a cemetery against the wishes of racist and armed townsfolk, sets the tone. Yul Brynner is, as always, fun to watch and to hear, and Eli Wallach is always a treat. The movie's theme music is among the most recognizable in cinema history.

    Every year a Mexican bandit and his large gang of forty thieves harass and plunder a poor farming village south of the American border. They take what they need in provisions from the increasingly impoverished inhabitants. Deciding that enough means ENOUGH (and the wise old man in the village advises that it is DO or DIE), the village elders recruit gunmen from the US to defend them. The actual recruiting of six of the motley crew of gunslingers is done by top American gunman, the grim Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), dressed in black. The wages are only twenty dollars but chow is included, and it is good Mexican food (as the Americans discover). Each one of the defenders has his own reasons for volunteering, and not necessarily as a sense of doing the right thing (one of the men is a soldier of fortune). The men have various talents. For instance, one is a sharpshooter; another is handy with a knife. Much of the film is obviously a build-up to the final confrontation between the "good guys" and the banditos. Outside of the rousing action-packed sequences, this movie has four merits: the actors, the cinematography, Elmer Bernstein's Oscar-nominated music score, and the on-location filming in Mexico. Stars and future stars like Yul Brynner, Charles Bronson, Steve Mc Queen, Robert Vaughn, and James Coburn do not disappoint. Eli Wallach, the future "Tuco," stars as an appropriate pitiless Mexican leader Calvera, who is not without his own concerns. Of course, with so many personalities, actors "battle" for screen time. There is an underlying message in this movie (and in subsequent remakes) that is overlooked: Mexico was a place of anarchy where the federal government could not always keep law and order. John Sturges' western was lifted from Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" (1954), perhaps the greatest movie ever filmed in Japan. In this original version, seven unemployed samurai swordsmen are also hired to fight bandits who terrorize a village. But Kurosawa made a superior film showing the importance of the code of honor of the defenders along with their three-dimensional character development (the film's length was much longer). He even showed a sketch of the Japanese village and the name (or symbols) of each of the bad guys. So when one of them was bumped off, one of the samurai would cross off his name from the bandit list. This helps the audience understand the defensive strategy and what was happening in the battles as the number of the bandits diminished. Nevertheless, "The Magnificent Seven" does stand on its own merits in the heyday of American westerns as a very good movie to enjoy. Even though the pacing is slow, it remains worthwhile watching.

    Being a screenwriter of sorts (i.e. someone who's never sold a screenplay), I've felt a western brewing in my excessively fertile mind. Trouble is, the closest to the Old West I've ever been was a day-trip to the Grand Canyon and while the memory of that trip will last a lifetime, it's not much to base an entire screenplay on. Figuring that a little cinematic research never did anyone a bit of harm (indeed, Quentin Tarantino has made a career of it), I went back to basics with this classic entry into the genre.

    A Hollywood re-imagining of The Seven Samurai comes in a form of a western, sounds pretty good to me. The Magnificent Seven is a fun western flick about protecting a helpless community from bad people. The film is fantastic and deserves to be watched by any western or even an action fan. The film is about a Mexican village hiring seven gunmen to protect them from the bandits who steals their food and crops. The script balances out the action and the character development moments very well. The film fleshes out it's characters and allows us to identify them, I feel this is effective in films with big cast as it makes us care for these people. The film's plot is simple and I think that's what made the film fun as it doesn't try to make you think about anything rather than what is shown in front of you, I know for some people that may be a bad thing but that's just you going in with the wrong mind set. This is the only film so far I have seen from John Sturges, so I didn't really expect anything mindblowing. The film won't be regarded as the best film in the genre but it is definitely a exhilarating ride. It's packed with action and not to the point where it feels repetitive or unnecessary. Sturges has made something accessible and entertaining without sacrificing story and emotion. My expectations for his other films have been raised, "The Great Escape" in particular. The cinematography by Charles Lang, was at times spectacular and sometimes feeling a little generic and typical. It's probably due to the fact that some scenes were limited as the it's shot in a small set or that the film's script doesn't involve a lot of these characters traveling. Sometimes when there are traveling scenes, this is usually a time where they can show off with beautiful cinematography. I did not hate the film's cinematography but I felt it was limited. Elmer Bernstein is a real highlight in this film, it's so memorable and catchy. I have a smile on my face when the theme comes on because I know the seven are gonna do something exciting or important. His score feels like an action film and it helps drive the film along, which is why along with quick editing makes this film feel very fast in it's pace. Bernstein's score is magnificent. The film is not going to be remembered for it's acting but the seven actors are different enough for me to tell which one is which. Yul Brenner was great as this leader and at times is challenged on screen by Steve McQueen. Both McQueen and Brenner work great together, as there is this sense of comradery between them. I love seeing Eli Wallach in films, especially his work on "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly". Wallach plays villains very well as he has this slimy quality to him and at the same time not being over the top with it. The rest of the cast weren't as iconic but they did their parts fine. Like I said, this film isn't known for it's acting so don't try to look for some award winning acting here. Overall the film is fun and entertaining. It does what it does and doesn't try to become deep or anything. An exciting story and wonderful direction makes this an essential western film. If you expect this to be like Sergio Leone where it takes it's time then this may not be what you are looking for but it is damn fun.

    A peace-loving community of Mexican farmers is repeatedly pillaged by dastardly Eli Wallach (as Calvera) and his bandits. The town decides to hire gunslingers to eliminate Mr. Wallach and his gang. Led by brave black-clad Yul Brynner (as Chris Adams), they become known to film viewers as "The Magnificent Seven". Early in the running time, Mr. Brynner picks up super-cool scene-stealer Steve McQueen (as Vin Tanner). The two drifters, from Dodge and Tombstone (wink, nod), attract younger hot-shot Horst Buchholz (as Chico). He gets the girl and most of the remaining screen action... Filling up the seven are Irish-Mexican father figure Charles Bronson (as Bernardo O'Reilly), edgy fugitive Robert Vaughn (as Lee), fortune seeking Brad Dexter (as Harry Luck) and knife wielder James Coburn (as Britt). Producer-director John Sturges looks up at his cast and locks up the landscape remarkably well, although this is obviously not as artful as Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" (1954). The music by Elmer Bernstein is excellent to the point of becoming occasionally distracting. While sometimes lacking, "The Magnificent Seven" is enjoyable as an addendum to the earlier classic. ******* The Magnificent Seven (10/23/60) John Sturges ~ Yul Brynner, Horst Buchholz, Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach

    "The Magnificent Seven" lacks "Seven Samurai"'s critique of rural society, and the characterizations of its heroes are much less pronounced. Artistically and content-wise it falls well short of Kurosawa's masterpiece. Still, it is a worthy example of the liberal-minded "message" Westerns of the 1950s and early 1960s. The opening scene, in which the heroes escort a coffin containing the corpse of a Native American to a cemetery against the wishes of racist and armed townsfolk, sets the tone. Yul Brynner is, as always, fun to watch and to hear, and Eli Wallach is always a treat. The movie's theme music is among the most recognizable in cinema history.

    Every year a Mexican bandit and his large gang of forty thieves harass and plunder a poor farming village south of the American border. They take what they need in provisions from the increasingly impoverished inhabitants. Deciding that enough means ENOUGH (and the wise old man in the village advises that it is DO or DIE), the village elders recruit gunmen from the US to defend them. The actual recruiting of six of the motley crew of gunslingers is done by top American gunman, the grim Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), dressed in black. The wages are only twenty dollars but chow is included, and it is good Mexican food (as the Americans discover). Each one of the defenders has his own reasons for volunteering, and not necessarily as a sense of doing the right thing (one of the men is a soldier of fortune). The men have various talents. For instance, one is a sharpshooter; another is handy with a knife. Much of the film is obviously a build-up to the final confrontation between the "good guys" and the banditos. Outside of the rousing action-packed sequences, this movie has four merits: the actors, the cinematography, Elmer Bernstein's Oscar-nominated music score, and the on-location filming in Mexico. Stars and future stars like Yul Brynner, Charles Bronson, Steve Mc Queen, Robert Vaughn, and James Coburn do not disappoint. Eli Wallach, the future "Tuco," stars as an appropriate pitiless Mexican leader Calvera, who is not without his own concerns. Of course, with so many personalities, actors "battle" for screen time. There is an underlying message in this movie (and in subsequent remakes) that is overlooked: Mexico was a place of anarchy where the federal government could not always keep law and order. John Sturges' western was lifted from Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" (1954), perhaps the greatest movie ever filmed in Japan. In this original version, seven unemployed samurai swordsmen are also hired to fight bandits who terrorize a village. But Kurosawa made a superior film showing the importance of the code of honor of the defenders along with their three-dimensional character development (the film's length was much longer). He even showed a sketch of the Japanese village and the name (or symbols) of each of the bad guys. So when one of them was bumped off, one of the samurai would cross off his name from the bandit list. This helps the audience understand the defensive strategy and what was happening in the battles as the number of the bandits diminished. Nevertheless, "The Magnificent Seven" does stand on its own merits in the heyday of American westerns as a very good movie to enjoy. Even though the pacing is slow, it remains worthwhile watching.

    Being a screenwriter of sorts (i.e. someone who's never sold a screenplay), I've felt a western brewing in my excessively fertile mind. Trouble is, the closest to the Old West I've ever been was a day-trip to the Grand Canyon and while the memory of that trip will last a lifetime, it's not much to base an entire screenplay on. Figuring that a little cinematic research never did anyone a bit of harm (indeed, Quentin Tarantino has made a career of it), I went back to basics with this classic entry into the genre. It may be based on the classic Japanese film "Seven Samurai" but this has all the western clich&eacute;s that fans of the genre will appreciate. A Mexican village is at the mercy of local bandito Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his vicious gang, who ride into town and help themselves to the crops the villagers grow for themselves. After deciding that enough is enough, three of them head into America to buy guns in which to defend themselves. Instead, they meet up with Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) who agrees to help them defend the village instead. Realising that his guns alone won't do, he gradually assembles a posse including knife-man Britt (James Coburn), sharp-shooter Vin (Steve McQueen), sharp-suited Lee (Robert Vaughn) and baby-faced hot-head Chico (Horst Buchholz) among others. The seven of them ride back to the village and prepare them all for the inevitable showdown, each with their own reasons for helping them. Anyone expecting the spit-and-polish of today's movies should probably look elsewhere because "The Magnificent Seven" is chock-full of the sort of over-the-top death staggers involving agonised clutches to the bright red patch on the stomach - you know, the sort of stuff that made westerns old-fashioned in the first place. What it has in reserve is atmosphere and authenticity - the gun battles are remarkably thrilling and exciting as characters dive for whatever cover they can find and stunt-work is impeccable. Performances are also very good - Brynner leads a great cast but weirdly, I never felt that all of the Seven were that well explained. The script doesn't allow the members equal footing and leaves Brynner and McQueen the majority of the lines. But I don't remember any of them having a back story to give themselves depth while Calvera is actually the most understood character on screen, leering and sneering as any baddie in a western should. The other thing a good western needs is a blazing score and Elmer Bernstein's classic theme really is one for the ages, stirring the blood and rousing the spirit in a way that modern films are rarely able to do. This is a film with real energy and a sense of occasion to it, belying its relatively simple story. But with a great cast and direction, it becomes more than a humble western - remember how the "Ocean's Eleven" remake became more than a simple heist flick when you first saw that unbelievable cast list? This is an adventure, a tale of bad men trying to redeem themselves and who can't fall for a story like that? It may stick rigidly to the genre stereotype but "The Magnificent Seven" is still a highly enjoyable film although I cannot compare to the original "Seven Samurai" because I've not seen that. And while westerns remain a niche area of cinema for me, they are inspiring enough to tempt me to have a go at writing one. Just need to remember not to have seven heroes in it...

    This was the first time i had seen this much loved old "classic" from 1960. Some critics felt it ushered in a new style of Western...but in reality, it did the opposite. It ended the card board cut out "heroes" and was replaced by Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood with there anti hero "man with no name". It was a reasonable movie (without the music it would have been limp) to end the fake westerns. It is endlessly said this was full of stars. It was actually full of potential stars (apart from Yul Bryner and Steve McQueen.) We all know it is a copy of Seven Sumarai by Japanese maestro Karosawa (but i am telling you again..!) He said he liked it, but i have a feeling he knew his original version was far superior. Bryner was too laconic here...he is far more effective dancing with Deborah Kerr wearing silly clothes. McQueen spent the first half of the movie trying to distract the audience by any means he could ..."look at me---I am the real star he appeared to be indicating"...maybe he was.

    I generally hate remakes and rarely are they as good as or better than the originals. In the case of "The Magnificent Seven", however, it's a really tough sell because the original was an Akira Kurosawa classic--a film currently in the top 10 on IMDb! So, there really is no way this western can be better...but it still is very good. In particular, the musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the best in the history of westerns and the cast of actors was incredibly--with the likes of Yul Brynner, James Coburn, Steve McQueen and many others as the seven. The film begins in a tiny Mexican town. The villagers are being plundered and harassed by a Mexican gang (led by Eli Wallach). Their choice is to keep knuckling under and starve or leave to get outside help. They decide on the latter and soon a small delegation heads up into the States to find some gunfighters willing to work for VERY little money. Luckily, they find a couple guys who seem to be tired of their lifestyles and want to do something better with their lives (Coburn and Brynner). These two are able to enlist some friends in the cause--no matter how hopeless it looks against an army of 40 men. What happens next, you'll need to see for yourself. What's not to like about this film? Very little. However, as I stated above it was a remake and so it needs to lose a point for originality. In addition, a few of the deaths seemed silly--like folks just wanting to die (especially the first member of the seven). Still, a very enjoyable and well made Hollywood film that is well worth seeing.

    I'm a sucker for this movie. When it shows up on the screen, I'm hooked to the end. Can't add much to others' praise and faults but have noticed two flaws. After the first fight, snipers terrorize the village until nightfall. Brynner and McQueen go looking for them. Later they return triumphant but nothing was shown. Doesn't it seem like a scene's missing? Maybe the film was ruined? At the end of the big climatic scene, Buchholz unhorsing a fleeing bandit to pursue his comrades but there's no follow up there either. Minor matters in an engrossing film. If it's campy now (and must have been a little in 1960, too), it's a feel-good bit of escapism. And the music's perfect.
