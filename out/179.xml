    I have heard a lot about this movie before i've decided to rent it a few days earlier. I heard about how violent it is and how controversy it caused on it's initial release and its ban (I learned about in my mass media class about violence in the media)even spawning a syndrome in which gangs of young men impersonate the main characters taking journeys of rape and the so-called "ultra-violence". After finally renting it and watching it i finally saw what this film really is: Extremely violent, disturbing and sick but ultimately a genius masterpiece and one of the finest works of cinema ever made. In futuristic Britain, young Alex and his gang enjoy going out at nights and hitting raping and cursing everything in their way, but when Alex is caught by the police for murdering (by accident) one of his victims he is sentenced to 14 years of prison, but when ALex hears about a new method that might help him get out of jail quick, which is an experiment that will eventually make him feel sick every time he gets into a situation that might trigger his violent and sexual desires. Alex agrees but while this method helps get out of jail and diminish his violent desires, it also takes away his humanity from him and his ability to make his own choices which leads society to take advantage of him and unleash its violence on him and Begin went through the experiment, he is left helpless against it. Everything about this film, from the script to the direction to the performances to the soundtrack (relying heavily on Beethoven's 9th symphony), and of course the violent and sexual footage that might disturb to a level that some will find too much, all add up to this films ultimate message: How much can the authorities take over the individual's ability to make his/her own decisions and strip him away from humanity no matter who he or she is. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece lives on and will continue to earn new fans every year, if u haven't seen this film before and have the ability to watch it, do yourself a favor and watch it, fro it is one of the greatest, most thought-provoking films ever made

    Nightmarish, highly stylized and plain bizarre, this remains one of the most controversial motion pictures of all time. Kubrick adapts Anthony Burgess' original novel with more visual flair than we're used to even from him, painting a ghoulish, depraved world in the not so distant future (at least, in 1971) where youth violence has run rampant. Malcolm McDowell, not one to turn down a shocking movie (like Caligula at the end of the decade), stars as the completely messed up sociopath gang leader Alex DeLarge whose various hobbies include hanging out at the local bar and taking illicit substances, classical music, raping women and just beating people for the fun of it. One night, he goes a little too far, which ends up in a trip to jail, where he volunteers for a scientific project designed to make offenders reject violence. After undergoing the experiments he is released and finds himself back on the streets, having to cope with the aftereffects of his actions when running into his old acquaintances, with not so nice results for his health, physically and mentally. The grotesque and haunting visual imagery aside, the film deals with the philosophical matter of freedom of will, as Alex is robbed of his in society's effort to keep kids like him in line, with dire consequences for the now peaceful subjects: are they really 'them' afterwards, being robbed of their choice to be violent or not? Of course most audiences ignored its thematic value and focused too much on Kubrick's portrayal of ruthless violence, which  despite his outrageous displays of 'Verfremdung' to make it easier on the soul  are still quite disturbing, ultimately leading to this film receiving X ratings around the globe and being withdrawn from UK circulation at Kubrick's insistence because it was said to inspire several violent incidents involving youths. It wasn't until Kubrick's death the film was finally allowed to be shown in British movie theaters.

    A film like "A Clockwork Orange" is very hard to bare. With subject matter of this film, it's hard not to. But there is something about "A Clockwork Orange" that pushes it to the edge on a psychological level. It's a misanthropic view of humanity's need to be controlled, and the need for freedom, a "balance" that needs to be made. It's a film that definitely will leave audiences in uncomfortable states of mind, but that is exactly what Stanley Kubrick wanted, and it worked perfectly. "A Clockwork Orange" is about a young criminal named Alex DeLarge who has a lust for "ultraviolence," and engages in the dirtiest of the dirtiest of crimes, assault, rape, murder, violent acts are what get Alex off. After being caught, he is placed in an experimental program where they "sensitize" Alex to the concepts of violence and rape, and the crippled mindset and life he is left. It's hard to find where to start with this film, it's, to a person like me, a perfect film. It gets an incredible emotional rise out of the viewers, and it's intellectually stimulating. The story originally written by Anthony Burgess is the back bone of what helped shaped the hopeful beginnings for this film. The story is perfect, especially for a cinematic style like Stanley Kubrick. The story is engaging for the audience, and is intellectually stimulating, questioning the boundaries between human control and human freedom. Stanley Kubrick is an incredible filmmaker. He has visions of pure genius, and knows exactly how to move his audience, and he does it perfectly with "A Clockwork Orange." He shows you the filth of humanity, and he's not afraid to push your feelings to the boundaries. This is the kind of story that HAD to be made by Stanley Kubrick to be as good as it is, a story as intense as "A Clockwork Orange" deserves to be handled by an intense filmmaker. Malcom McDowell's performance of Alex is excellent. He portrays a cold, lifeless, power hungry, psychopathic criminal with a scary charm, a perfect performance for such a twisted character. The cinematography is unbelievable. A great use of color, and great composition in nearly every shot, very common traits of Stanley Kubrick's films. The cinematography in this film reminds me of the photographic work of William Eggleston for some reason. In Kubrick's black and white films he reminds me more of Robert Frank. The music choice is unbelievable. The synthesized version of "Funeral For Queen Mary" was an interesting choice for a theme song for the film, and Beethoven's 9th Symphony is always an excellent listen, but the contrast between Alex's violence and his love of Beethoven is an interesting clash of ideas. Before I make this review too long, I will go ahead and wrap it up. This is a must see film, despite its "extreme intensity" emotionally on its viewers. It's a true cinematic classic, and will be a perfect example, to me at least, of what true art should be.

    **gives away scenes in the movie** This movie is one of my favorites. It really gets you into the mind of a psychopath and what makes him tick. Every scene of this movie shows just how his mind is set and what exactly he is after. He is violent and aggressive. To me the name of the movie really can say a lot about it. ''Clockwork'' meaning mechanical. When Alex is arrested he is then placed in a mental hospital where they basically brainwash him to be good. Well, what this movie really symbolizes is you can't play the role of God. Alex is being forced to be good when it's not in his nature. ''Orange'' actually represents a person. How their bright and can stand out. They're simply trying to take is individuality away. They're just trying to make him mechanical. After all the therapy and brainwashing he endures he realizes that every time he is exposed to violence he gets ill. And at a few other scenes in the movie you notice he gets ill from hearing Beethoven.(something he actually found beauty in) Which at some point drives him crazy and he attempts suicide. As he lays in the hospital and promises to keep what really happened secret it shows how he is no longer brainwashed. This is shown when they play Beethoven in the background and his sudden vision at the end. It also represents that you can never mold someone into what they are not. You can't change someone if they don't want to be changed. And in the words of the writer Anthony Burgess: "What I was trying to say was that it is better to be bad of one's own free will than to be good through scientific brainwashing" he also says "When Alex has the power of choice, he chooses only violence. But, as his love of music shows, there are other areas of choice."

    A Clockwork Orange isn't an atypical classic because nearly everything you can say about it has already been said. Praising it has become a pretty traditional thing to do, and if you dare criticize it, then you must endure not just the cult-fanbase but the Kubrick-fanbase. I wouldn't wish backlash from both of those groups on an enemy. Howeer, I shouldn't be hearing it from either. Stanley Kubrick's controversial classic is a troubling but required watch, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, which is rumored to be inspired from a personal instance. Burgess's wife was brutally assaulted by a group of thugs at one point, and Burgess tried to penetrate the psychology of such unconscionable men who would dare commit such a disgusting, degrading act. If this is true - and Kubrick left Burgess's message from the novel in tact - then the stance he takes here is stunningly humanistic and brave. The film stars a young, energetic Malcolm McDowell as Alex, a young man who commits unsightly atrocities such as rape and assault upon getting innocent people to open their doors thinking they're doing a helpless soul a favor who they believe was in a car-wreck. He commits these crimes with a gang of men he calls his "droogs," and their spree resorts to an ugly but surprisingly professional scene of rape. During this scene, Alex sings a familiar song you will not see in the same light again (similar to how Alex will later react to a specific song, but I'm getting ahead of myself). Alex is eventually arrested and thrown into prison, but he's given an option upon entering the compound. He can be simply jailed or he can be psychologically conditioned - a new process that can help him - to be good and moral. He chooses to be conditioned and undergoes a series of mentally trying tests that take his individuality, regardless of how despicable it is, along with the basic qualities of him being a human with free-will. After the lengthy psychological processes are complete, he's released back into society as a changed man. Though it predated techno-music pioneer Gary Numan's career by a few years, A Clockwork Orange seems like a cinematic adaptation of one of Numan's darkest, eeriest songs. From the stunningly cold voice of Alex, to the futuristic, dystopian environment, to the beautifully polished set-designs, it seems as if this is a Gary Numan song with the benefit of being a one-hundred and thirty-eight minute music video. All I was waiting for in the end was the Machman to show up. Moreover, the content of this film is widely known to be explicit and still somewhat shocking to this date. But make no mistake in saying the film is mean-spirited just to be mean-spirited. The film's commentary on psychological conditioning taking away human individuality and free will and devaluing ones worth to making him a conforming citizen in a world with diminishing uniqueness is strong and potent. A Clockwork Orange isn't an exploitation film and it isn't a film with violence for violence's sake. The film goes to great lengths to detail psychology and conditioning to the point where it wouldn't be a stretch to name it one of the field's biggest films. The film is also another case where the lead actor and director team up to make an incredible match. Malcolm McDowell gives a tremendous performance here that's troubling, alive, and coldly inspiring. McDowell is only elevated by Stanley Kubrick's typically wide-angle shots and very spacious long shots that show the landscape of the shots and the futuristic design of Kubrick's vision. These talents combined give A Clockwork Orange the strong performance and directorial leverage it needs to communicate its story and message significantly. Finally, it must be said that A Clockwork Orange was going to be a challenge to adapt to the screen no matter assumed what position. The novel is more heavy on the slang than the film, and featured a large glossary in the back of the book defining every word clearly. The film doesn't have that privilege and likely several others that are exclusive to the novel. As all book-to-movie adaptations, the film provides the benefits of a specific (not an absolute, as many confuse) vision of the novel's work and, as a result, may offer the best adaptation one will ever see of the novel. Starring: Malcolm McDowell. Directed by: Stanley Kubrick.

    Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel must rank as one of the most controversial and disturbing mainstream films ever made. Story deals with a young hooligan named Alex(vividly brought to life by Malcolm McDowell) who leads a gang of vicious young British thugs as they mercilessly terrorize various innocent people, when their not fighting with other gangs. Alex breaks up the gang, and is captured by the authorities, who make him the willing subject of an experiment where all the aggressive thoughts are wiped from his mind, leaving him practically helpless later, when he is declared "cured" and sent back into society, where he will then reap what he has sewn... Of course, that's part of the point, that unless you cure society of the very thing you would cure an individual, you will still be left with a problem. Seeing Alex get punished by those he victimized is without doubt satisfying(Charles Bronson would have shot these punks dead without a second thought in his "Death Wish" films!)So Kubrick puts the viewer in the exact position of the avenging victims, which can also be uncomfortable on reflection, but we know exactly what Alex did, though was that part of him really cured? Is it dead? Or can it be revived? The difference between violence being sanctioned or unsanctioned, depending on whether they work for the government or not(as some of the gang will...) Kubrick gives the audience much to consider in this shocking film, not always easy to watch(to say the least) but one that cannot be easily dismissed either, though it was banned for years, but can now be seen on DVD.

    Stanley Kubrick manages to create an incredibly; questionable atmosphere throughout the film. Though it may be intended in the novel to represent a future Britain, the film still uses 70's fashion, style and architect, with much stronger and colourful sexual nature. Malcolm McDowell's delivery of the characteristics of Alex are truly extraordinary. Of course his physical traits allow him to portray Alex, whereas, his psychological traits portray a remarkable; gentlemanly character. As a matter of fact, Alex appears to be delinquent with an isolated soul. The scenes of sexual and violent nature can be perceived as 'Disturbing', though Kubrick has appeared to have used mild black comedy to prevent fear and worry of the audiences own safety. The locations used in A Clockwork Orange all have the 'groovy' colour and style that surprisingly creates a cold unwelcoming atmosphere. Which gives off the feeling that the country has fallen and will not be restored to its safe state. All in all, the film can leave one feeling confused and cold. Though it is a must-see, and well worth your time. An absolute work of art.

    This witty and stylistic film inspired many of the new age filmmakers and actors over the years. Murder, Rape, Violence, Sex, and Mental disease all in one cluster made film. This film made by Stanley Kubrick, adapted from Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel, follows charismatic delinquent that is jailed and volunteers for an experimental aversion therapy developed by the government in an effort to solve society's crime problem, but once his problem is cured if follows the horrid aftermath of things that happen to him once he's "cured". You go from hating and even being envious of this character to hating him some more, but once cured you feel sympathy for the terrible things that happens to him, but know he deserves it.

    Stanley Kubrick always knew how to use music in his films and "A Clockwork Orange" is no exception--Most of the music was written by Walter Carlos (of 'Switched On Bach' album fame) who later changed his sex and became Wendy Carlos..What's so fantastic is the way the music draws you in and never lets go throughout the film (especially in the scenes where Alex is forced to sit in a 'dentist' type chair, get eye drops put in, and forced to watch past history experiences of "Ultra Violence" which include some disturbing scenes of Hitler's rise to power during WWII)...If there was a separate rating for this film's musical score, I'd give it 10/10 stars!

    On any list of controversial films released, it's nearly guaranteed to find Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange somewhere on the list, most likely near the top. Kubrick's classic adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel of the same name is often regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time, but also as one of the most controversial. Brutal violence and sexuality feature prominently within A Clockwork Orange, which caused the film to be withdrawn from British cinemas until Kubrick's death in 1999. Regardless of the extreme violence and sexuality, A Clockwork Orange is one of Kubrick's finest hours and is one of cinema's greatest outings. Following the Burgess novel, A Clockwork Orange is set in a dystopian London in the near future. In this dystopia, Alex DeLarge and his group of "droogs" frequently roam the city and commit acts of "ultra-violence" after stopping by the Korova milk bar to drink intoxicated "milk plus." Just a young teenager, Alex's favorite pastimes include brutality of innocent citizens, rape and sexuality, and classical music, most notably Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex has no sympathy for any of his victims as he commits new crimes each and every night. During one of his midnight assaults, Alex is taken into custody by the police. Sentenced to fourteen years in prison, Alex finds a way to escape back into society though the experimental Ludovico Treatment. A kind of aversion therapy, the Ludovico Treatment is successful as Alex becomes the clockwork orange of society. However, the changes brought on by the government will leave lasting changes on Alex and the new society he enters, with some interesting results. Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel is fantastic, and is one of Kubrick's more faithful adaptations. The writing executes the extremely engrossing story very well, keeping you immersed and fascinated by the characters and events going on. The film makes smooth transitions from the different acts, each of which is nothing like the other. Dialogue between characters is very well written, often with some of Kubrick's dark humor. The use of nadsat, a fictional language used by Alex and his droogs, is used frequently, but works very well without becoming overwhelming. The most important aspect of A Clockwork Orange's writing is the themes of the story itself. Ultimately, the film asks whether it is right to take away one's freedom for the good of everyone else. The stand out of A Clockwork Orange is the amazing performance from Malcolm McDowell as Alex. As sadistic and twisted the character is, you can't help but feel sympathetic for him when he's freedom is forced away from him at the hands of others, and McDowell is certainly a driving force in this characteristic. Every line McDowell delivers is memorable and amazing. McDowell completely embodies the character of Alex, something most actors can never do in their roles. In fact, there's not a single actor that would have been a better fit for Alex than McDowell. It's no wonder the character of Alex is so beloved among the cult following A Clockwork Orange has. Another superb element of A Clockwork Orange is the choice of music. Like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film doesn't create an entirely original score, but rather uses classic pieces of music mixed in with synthesized pieces by composer Walter Carlos (later known as Wendy Carlos). Every song is perfectly edited in with the wonderful Kubrick visuals to create a perfect combination. Henry Purcell's Funeral of Queen Mary serves as the perfect introduction for the movie in every way. A sped up version of the William Tell Overture is used during a fast motion sex scene, and Beethoven's symphonies are used prominently. Easily the most recognizable, and infamous, piece in the movie is Singin in the Rain, which is used in a disturbingly effective way during a rape scene. Everything about A Clockwork Orange embodies Kubrick's perfectionism and greatness. Kubrick would go on and make movies until his untimely death, but A Clockwork Orange stands as Kubrick's finest work. The story is told with both fantastic writing and the visual style we've come to expect from Stanley Kubrick. Top it off with a Golden Globe nominated (and Oscar worthy) performance by Malcolm McDowell and perfectly chosen music tracks and you've got a classic piece of film history. There are simply no words to describe A Clockwork Orange's greatness.

The cinematography is unbelievable. A great use of color, and great composition in nearly every shot, very common traits of Stanley Kubrick's films. The cinematography in this film reminds me of the photographic work of William Eggleston for some reason. In Kubrick's black and white films he reminds me more of Robert Frank. The music choice is unbelievable. The synthesized version of "Funeral For Queen Mary" was an interesting choice for a theme song for the film, and Beethoven's 9th Symphony is always an excellent listen, but the contrast between Alex's violence and his love of Beethoven is an interesting clash of ideas. Before I make this review too long, I will go ahead and wrap it up. This is a must see film, despite its "extreme intensity" emotionally on its viewers. It's a true cinematic classic, and will be a perfect example, to me at least, of what true art should be.

    **gives away scenes in the movie** This movie is one of my favorites. It really gets you into the mind of a psychopath and what makes him tick. Every scene of this movie shows just how his mind is set and what exactly he is after. He is violent and aggressive. To me the name of the movie really can say a lot about it. ''Clockwork'' meaning mechanical. When Alex is arrested he is then placed in a mental hospital where they basically brainwash him to be good. Well, what this movie really symbolizes is you can't play the role of God. Alex is being forced to be good when it's not in his nature. ''Orange'' actually represents a person. How their bright and can stand out. They're simply trying to take is individuality away. They're just trying to make him mechanical. After all the therapy and brainwashing he endures he realizes that every time he is exposed to violence he gets ill. And at a few other scenes in the movie you notice he gets ill from hearing Beethoven.(something he actually found beauty in) Which at some point drives him crazy and he attempts suicide. As he lays in the hospital and promises to keep what really happened secret it shows how he is no longer brainwashed. This is shown when they play Beethoven in the background and his sudden vision at the end. It also represents that you can never mold someone into what they are not. You can't change someone if they don't want to be changed. And in the words of the writer Anthony Burgess: "What I was trying to say was that it is better to be bad of one's own free will than to be good through scientific brainwashing" he also says "When Alex has the power of choice, he chooses only violence. But, as his love of music shows, there are other areas of choice."

    A Clockwork Orange isn't an atypical classic because nearly everything you can say about it has already been said. Praising it has become a pretty traditional thing to do, and if you dare criticize it, then you must endure not just the cult-fanbase but the Kubrick-fanbase. I wouldn't wish backlash from both of those groups on an enemy. Howeer, I shouldn't be hearing it from either. Stanley Kubrick's controversial classic is a troubling but required watch, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, which is rumored to be inspired from a personal instance. Burgess's wife was brutally assaulted by a group of thugs at one point, and Burgess tried to penetrate the psychology of such unconscionable men who would dare commit such a disgusting, degrading act. If this is true - and Kubrick left Burgess's message from the novel in tact - then the stance he takes here is stunningly humanistic and brave. The film stars a young, energetic Malcolm McDowell as Alex, a young man who commits unsightly atrocities such as rape and assault upon getting innocent people to open their doors thinking they're doing a helpless soul a favor who they believe was in a car-wreck. He commits these crimes with a gang of men he calls his "droogs," and their spree resorts to an ugly but surprisingly professional scene of rape. During this scene, Alex sings a familiar song you will not see in the same light again (similar to how Alex will later react to a specific song, but I'm getting ahead of myself). Alex is eventually arrested and thrown into prison, but he's given an option upon entering the compound. He can be simply jailed or he can be psychologically conditioned - a new process that can help him - to be good and moral. He chooses to be conditioned and undergoes a series of mentally trying tests that take his individuality, regardless of how despicable it is, along with the basic qualities of him being a human with free-will. After the lengthy psychological processes are complete, he's released back into society as a changed man. Though it predated techno-music pioneer Gary Numan's career by a few years, A Clockwork Orange seems like a cinematic adaptation of one of Numan's darkest, eeriest songs. From the stunningly cold voice of Alex, to the futuristic, dystopian environment, to the beautifully polished set-designs, it seems as if this is a Gary Numan song with the benefit of being a one-hundred and thirty-eight minute music video. All I was waiting for in the end was the Machman to show up. Moreover, the content of this film is widely known to be explicit and still somewhat shocking to this date. But make no mistake in saying the film is mean-spirited just to be mean-spirited. The film's commentary on psychological conditioning taking away human individuality and free will and devaluing ones worth to making him a conforming citizen in a world with diminishing uniqueness is strong and potent. A Clockwork Orange isn't an exploitation film and it isn't a film with violence for violence's sake. The film goes to great lengths to detail psychology and conditioning to the point where it wouldn't be a stretch to name it one of the field's biggest films. The film is also another case where the lead actor and director team up to make an incredible match. Malcolm McDowell gives a tremendous performance here that's troubling, alive, and coldly inspiring. McDowell is only elevated by Stanley Kubrick's typically wide-angle shots and very spacious long shots that show the landscape of the shots and the futuristic design of Kubrick's vision. These talents combined give A Clockwork Orange the strong performance and directorial leverage it needs to communicate its story and message significantly. Finally, it must be said that A Clockwork Orange was going to be a challenge to adapt to the screen no matter assumed what position. The novel is more heavy on the slang than the film, and featured a large glossary in the back of the book defining every word clearly. The film doesn't have that privilege and likely several others that are exclusive to the novel. As all book-to-movie adaptations, the film provides the benefits of a specific (not an absolute, as many confuse) vision of the novel's work and, as a result, may offer the best adaptation one will ever see of the novel. Starring: Malcolm McDowell. Directed by: Stanley Kubrick.

    Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel must rank as one of the most controversial and disturbing mainstream films ever made. Story deals with a young hooligan named Alex(vividly brought to life by Malcolm McDowell) who leads a gang of vicious young British thugs as they mercilessly terrorize various innocent people, when their not fighting with other gangs. Alex breaks up the gang, and is captured by the authorities, who make him the willing subject of an experiment where all the aggressive thoughts are wiped from his mind, leaving him practically helpless later, when he is declared "cured" and sent back into society, where he will then reap what he has sewn... Of course, that's part of the point, that unless you cure society of the very thing you would cure an individual, you will still be left with a problem. Seeing Alex get punished by those he victimized is without doubt satisfying(Charles Bronson would have shot these punks dead without a second thought in his "Death Wish" films!)So Kubrick puts the viewer in the exact position of the avenging victims, which can also be uncomfortable on reflection, but we know exactly what Alex did, though was that part of him really cured? Is it dead? Or can it be revived? The difference between violence being sanctioned or unsanctioned, depending on whether they work for the government or not(as some of the gang will...) Kubrick gives the audience much to consider in this shocking film, not always easy to watch(to say the least) but one that cannot be easily dismissed either, though it was banned for years, but can now be seen on DVD.

    Stanley Kubrick manages to create an incredibly; questionable atmosphere throughout the film. Though it may be intended in the novel to represent a future Britain, the film still uses 70's fashion, style and architect, with much stronger and colourful sexual nature. Malcolm McDowell's delivery of the characteristics of Alex are truly extraordinary. Of course his physical traits allow him to portray Alex, whereas, his psychological traits portray a remarkable; gentlemanly character. As a matter of fact, Alex appears to be delinquent with an isolated soul. The scenes of sexual and violent nature can be perceived as 'Disturbing', though Kubrick has appeared to have used mild black comedy to prevent fear and worry of the audiences own safety. The locations used in A Clockwork Orange all have the 'groovy' colour and style that surprisingly creates a cold unwelcoming atmosphere. Which gives off the feeling that the country has fallen and will not be restored to its safe state. All in all, the film can leave one feeling confused and cold. Though it is a must-see, and well worth your time. An absolute work of art.

    This witty and stylistic film inspired many of the new age filmmakers and actors over the years. Murder, Rape, Violence, Sex, and Mental disease all in one cluster made film. This film made by Stanley Kubrick, adapted from Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel, follows charismatic delinquent that is jailed and volunteers for an experimental aversion therapy developed by the government in an effort to solve society's crime problem, but once his problem is cured if follows the horrid aftermath of things that happen to him once he's "cured". You go from hating and even being envious of this character to hating him some more, but once cured you feel sympathy for the terrible things that happens to him, but know he deserves it.

    Stanley Kubrick always knew how to use music in his films and "A Clockwork Orange" is no exception--Most of the music was written by Walter Carlos (of 'Switched On Bach' album fame) who later changed his sex and became Wendy Carlos..What's so fantastic is the way the music draws you in and never lets go throughout the film (especially in the scenes where Alex is forced to sit in a 'dentist' type chair, get eye drops put in, and forced to watch past history experiences of "Ultra Violence" which include some disturbing scenes of Hitler's rise to power during WWII)...If there was a separate rating for this film's musical score, I'd give it 10/10 stars!

    On any list of controversial films released, it's nearly guaranteed to find Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange somewhere on the list, most likely near the top. Kubrick's classic adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel of the same name is often regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time, but also as one of the most controversial. Brutal violence and sexuality feature prominently within A Clockwork Orange, which caused the film to be withdrawn from British cinemas until Kubrick's death in 1999. Regardless of the extreme violence and sexuality, A Clockwork Orange is one of Kubrick's finest hours and is one of cinema's greatest outings. Following the Burgess novel, A Clockwork Orange is set in a dystopian London in the near future. In this dystopia, Alex DeLarge and his group of "droogs" frequently roam the city and commit acts of "ultra-violence" after stopping by the Korova milk bar to drink intoxicated "milk plus." Just a young teenager, Alex's favorite pastimes include brutality of innocent citizens, rape and sexuality, and classical music, most notably Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex has no sympathy for any of his victims as he commits new crimes each and every night. During one of his midnight assaults, Alex is taken into custody by the police. Sentenced to fourteen years in prison, Alex finds a way to escape back into society though the experimental Ludovico Treatment. A kind of aversion therapy, the Ludovico Treatment is successful as Alex becomes the clockwork orange of society. However, the changes brought on by the government will leave lasting changes on Alex and the new society he enters, with some interesting results. Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel is fantastic, and is one of Kubrick's more faithful adaptations. The writing executes the extremely engrossing story very well, keeping you immersed and fascinated by the characters and events going on. The film makes smooth transitions from the different acts, each of which is nothing like the other. Dialogue between characters is very well written, often with some of Kubrick's dark humor. The use of nadsat, a fictional language used by Alex and his droogs, is used frequently, but works very well without becoming overwhelming. The most important aspect of A Clockwork Orange's writing is the themes of the story itself. Ultimately, the film asks whether it is right to take away one's freedom for the good of everyone else. The stand out of A Clockwork Orange is the amazing performance from Malcolm McDowell as Alex. As sadistic and twisted the character is, you can't help but feel sympathetic for him when he's freedom is forced away from him at the hands of others, and McDowell is certainly a driving force in this characteristic. Every line McDowell delivers is memorable and amazing. McDowell completely embodies the character of Alex, something most actors can never do in their roles. In fact, there's not a single actor that would have been a better fit for Alex than McDowell. It's no wonder the character of Alex is so beloved among the cult following A Clockwork Orange has. Another superb element of A Clockwork Orange is the choice of music. Like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film doesn't create an entirely original score, but rather uses classic pieces of music mixed in with synthesized pieces by composer Walter Carlos (later known as Wendy Carlos). Every song is perfectly edited in with the wonderful Kubrick visuals to create a perfect combination. Henry Purcell's Funeral of Queen Mary serves as the perfect introduction for the movie in every way. A sped up version of the William Tell Overture is used during a fast motion sex scene, and Beethoven's symphonies are used prominently. Easily the most recognizable, and infamous, piece in the movie is Singin in the Rain, which is used in a disturbingly effective way during a rape scene. Everything about A Clockwork Orange embodies Kubrick's perfectionism and greatness. Kubrick would go on and make movies until his untimely death, but A Clockwork Orange stands as Kubrick's finest work. The story is told with both fantastic writing and the visual style we've come to expect from Stanley Kubrick. Top it off with a Golden Globe nominated (and Oscar worthy) performance by Malcolm McDowell and perfectly chosen music tracks and you've got a classic piece of film history. There are simply no words to describe A Clockwork Orange's greatness.

    I have heard a lot about this movie before i've decided to rent it a few days earlier. I heard about how violent it is and how controversy it caused on it's initial release and its ban (I learned about in my mass media class about violence in the media)even spawning a syndrome in which gangs of young men impersonate the main characters taking journeys of rape and the so-called "ultra-violence". After finally renting it and watching it i finally saw what this film really is: Extremely violent, disturbing and sick but ultimately a genius masterpiece and one of the finest works of cinema ever made. In futuristic Britain, young Alex and his gang enjoy going out at nights and hitting raping and cursing everything in their way, but when Alex is caught by the police for murdering (by accident) one of his victims he is sentenced to 14 years of prison, but when ALex hears about a new method that might help him get out of jail quick, which is an experiment that will eventually make him feel sick every time he gets into a situation that might trigger his violent and sexual desires. Alex agrees but while this method helps get out of jail and diminish his violent desires, it also takes away his humanity from him and his ability to make his own choices which leads society to take advantage of him and unleash its violence on him and Begin went through the experiment, he is left helpless against it. Everything about this film, from the script to the direction to the performances to the soundtrack (relying heavily on Beethoven's 9th symphony), and of course the violent and sexual footage that might disturb to a level that some will find too much, all add up to this films ultimate message: How much can the authorities take over the individual's ability to make his/her own decisions and strip him away from humanity no matter who he or she is. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece lives on and will continue to earn new fans every year, if u haven't seen this film before and have the ability to watch it, do yourself a favor and watch it, fro it is one of the greatest, most thought-provoking films ever made

    Nightmarish, highly stylized and plain bizarre, this remains one of the most controversial motion pictures of all time. Kubrick adapts Anthony Burgess' original novel with more visual flair than we're used to even from him, painting a ghoulish, depraved world in the not so distant future (at least, in 1971) where youth violence has run rampant. Malcolm McDowell, not one to turn down a shocking movie (like Caligula at the end of the decade), stars as the completely messed up sociopath gang leader Alex DeLarge whose various hobbies include hanging out at the local bar and taking illicit substances, classical music, raping women and just beating people for the fun of it. One night, he goes a little too far, which ends up in a trip to jail, where he volunteers for a scientific project designed to make offenders reject violence. After undergoing the experiments he is released and finds himself back on the streets, having to cope with the aftereffects of his actions when running into his old acquaintances, with not so nice results for his health, physically and mentally. The grotesque and haunting visual imagery aside, the film deals with the philosophical matter of freedom of will, as Alex is robbed of his in society's effort to keep kids like him in line, with dire consequences for the now peaceful subjects: are they really 'them' afterwards, being robbed of their choice to be violent or not? Of course most audiences ignored its thematic value and focused too much on Kubrick's portrayal of ruthless violence, which  despite his outrageous displays of 'Verfremdung' to make it easier on the soul  are still quite disturbing, ultimately leading to this film receiving X ratings around the globe and being withdrawn from UK circulation at Kubrick's insistence because it was said to inspire several violent incidents involving youths. It wasn't until Kubrick's death the film was finally allowed to be shown in British movie theaters.

    A film like "A Clockwork Orange" is very hard to bare. With subject matter of this film, it's hard not to. But there is something about "A Clockwork Orange" that pushes it to the edge on a psychological level. It's a misanthropic view of humanity's need to be controlled, and the need for freedom, a "balance" that needs to be made. It's a film that definitely will leave audiences in uncomfortable states of mind, but that is exactly what Stanley Kubrick wanted, and it worked perfectly. "A Clockwork Orange" is about a young criminal named Alex DeLarge who has a lust for "ultraviolence," and engages in the dirtiest of the dirtiest of crimes, assault, rape, murder, violent acts are what get Alex off. After being caught, he is placed in an experimental program where they "sensitize" Alex to the concepts of violence and rape, and the crippled mindset and life he is left. It's hard to find where to start with this film, it's, to a person like me, a perfect film. It gets an incredible emotional rise out of the viewers, and it's intellectually stimulating. The story originally written by Anthony Burgess is the back bone of what helped shaped the hopeful beginnings for this film. The story is perfect, especially for a cinematic style like Stanley Kubrick. The story is engaging for the audience, and is intellectually stimulating, questioning the boundaries between human control and human freedom. Stanley Kubrick is an incredible filmmaker. He has visions of pure genius, and knows exactly how to move his audience, and he does it perfectly with "A Clockwork Orange." He shows you the filth of humanity, and he's not afraid to push your feelings to the boundaries. This is the kind of story that HAD to be made by Stanley Kubrick to be as good as it is, a story as intense as "A Clockwork Orange" deserves to be handled by an intense filmmaker. Malcom McDowell's performance of Alex is excellent. He portrays a cold, lifeless, power hungry, psychopathic criminal with a scary charm, a perfect performance for such a twisted character. The cinematography is unbelievable. A great use of color, and great composition in nearly every shot, very common traits of Stanley Kubrick's films. The cinematography in this film reminds me of the photographic work of William Eggleston for some reason. In Kubrick's black and white films he reminds me more of Robert Frank. The music choice is unbelievable. The synthesized version of "Funeral For Queen Mary" was an interesting choice for a theme song for the film, and Beethoven's 9th Symphony is always an excellent listen, but the contrast between Alex's violence and his love of Beethoven is an interesting clash of ideas. Before I make this review too long, I will go ahead and wrap it up. This is a must see film, despite its "extreme intensity" emotionally on its viewers. It's a true cinematic classic, and will be a perfect example, to me at least, of what true art should be.

Kubrick gives the audience much to consider in this shocking film, not always easy to watch(to say the least) but one that cannot be easily dismissed either, though it was banned for years, but can now be seen on DVD.

    Stanley Kubrick manages to create an incredibly; questionable atmosphere throughout the film. Though it may be intended in the novel to represent a future Britain, the film still uses 70's fashion, style and architect, with much stronger and colourful sexual nature. Malcolm McDowell's delivery of the characteristics of Alex are truly extraordinary. Of course his physical traits allow him to portray Alex, whereas, his psychological traits portray a remarkable; gentlemanly character. As a matter of fact, Alex appears to be delinquent with an isolated soul. The scenes of sexual and violent nature can be perceived as 'Disturbing', though Kubrick has appeared to have used mild black comedy to prevent fear and worry of the audiences own safety. The locations used in A Clockwork Orange all have the 'groovy' colour and style that surprisingly creates a cold unwelcoming atmosphere. Which gives off the feeling that the country has fallen and will not be restored to its safe state. All in all, the film can leave one feeling confused and cold. Though it is a must-see, and well worth your time. An absolute work of art.

    This witty and stylistic film inspired many of the new age filmmakers and actors over the years. Murder, Rape, Violence, Sex, and Mental disease all in one cluster made film. This film made by Stanley Kubrick, adapted from Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel, follows charismatic delinquent that is jailed and volunteers for an experimental aversion therapy developed by the government in an effort to solve society's crime problem, but once his problem is cured if follows the horrid aftermath of things that happen to him once he's "cured". You go from hating and even being envious of this character to hating him some more, but once cured you feel sympathy for the terrible things that happens to him, but know he deserves it.

    Stanley Kubrick always knew how to use music in his films and "A Clockwork Orange" is no exception--Most of the music was written by Walter Carlos (of 'Switched On Bach' album fame) who later changed his sex and became Wendy Carlos..What's so fantastic is the way the music draws you in and never lets go throughout the film (especially in the scenes where Alex is forced to sit in a 'dentist' type chair, get eye drops put in, and forced to watch past history experiences of "Ultra Violence" which include some disturbing scenes of Hitler's rise to power during WWII)...If there was a separate rating for this film's musical score, I'd give it 10/10 stars!

    On any list of controversial films released, it's nearly guaranteed to find Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange somewhere on the list, most likely near the top. Kubrick's classic adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel of the same name is often regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time, but also as one of the most controversial. Brutal violence and sexuality feature prominently within A Clockwork Orange, which caused the film to be withdrawn from British cinemas until Kubrick's death in 1999. Regardless of the extreme violence and sexuality, A Clockwork Orange is one of Kubrick's finest hours and is one of cinema's greatest outings. Following the Burgess novel, A Clockwork Orange is set in a dystopian London in the near future. In this dystopia, Alex DeLarge and his group of "droogs" frequently roam the city and commit acts of "ultra-violence" after stopping by the Korova milk bar to drink intoxicated "milk plus." Just a young teenager, Alex's favorite pastimes include brutality of innocent citizens, rape and sexuality, and classical music, most notably Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex has no sympathy for any of his victims as he commits new crimes each and every night. During one of his midnight assaults, Alex is taken into custody by the police. Sentenced to fourteen years in prison, Alex finds a way to escape back into society though the experimental Ludovico Treatment. A kind of aversion therapy, the Ludovico Treatment is successful as Alex becomes the clockwork orange of society. However, the changes brought on by the government will leave lasting changes on Alex and the new society he enters, with some interesting results. Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel is fantastic, and is one of Kubrick's more faithful adaptations. The writing executes the extremely engrossing story very well, keeping you immersed and fascinated by the characters and events going on. The film makes smooth transitions from the different acts, each of which is nothing like the other. Dialogue between characters is very well written, often with some of Kubrick's dark humor. The use of nadsat, a fictional language used by Alex and his droogs, is used frequently, but works very well without becoming overwhelming. The most important aspect of A Clockwork Orange's writing is the themes of the story itself. Ultimately, the film asks whether it is right to take away one's freedom for the good of everyone else. The stand out of A Clockwork Orange is the amazing performance from Malcolm McDowell as Alex. As sadistic and twisted the character is, you can't help but feel sympathetic for him when he's freedom is forced away from him at the hands of others, and McDowell is certainly a driving force in this characteristic. Every line McDowell delivers is memorable and amazing. McDowell completely embodies the character of Alex, something most actors can never do in their roles. In fact, there's not a single actor that would have been a better fit for Alex than McDowell. It's no wonder the character of Alex is so beloved among the cult following A Clockwork Orange has. Another superb element of A Clockwork Orange is the choice of music. Like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film doesn't create an entirely original score, but rather uses classic pieces of music mixed in with synthesized pieces by composer Walter Carlos (later known as Wendy Carlos). Every song is perfectly edited in with the wonderful Kubrick visuals to create a perfect combination. Henry Purcell's Funeral of Queen Mary serves as the perfect introduction for the movie in every way. A sped up version of the William Tell Overture is used during a fast motion sex scene, and Beethoven's symphonies are used prominently. Easily the most recognizable, and infamous, piece in the movie is Singin in the Rain, which is used in a disturbingly effective way during a rape scene. Everything about A Clockwork Orange embodies Kubrick's perfectionism and greatness. Kubrick would go on and make movies until his untimely death, but A Clockwork Orange stands as Kubrick's finest work. The story is told with both fantastic writing and the visual style we've come to expect from Stanley Kubrick. Top it off with a Golden Globe nominated (and Oscar worthy) performance by Malcolm McDowell and perfectly chosen music tracks and you've got a classic piece of film history. There are simply no words to describe A Clockwork Orange's greatness.

    I have heard a lot about this movie before i've decided to rent it a few days earlier. I heard about how violent it is and how controversy it caused on it's initial release and its ban (I learned about in my mass media class about violence in the media)even spawning a syndrome in which gangs of young men impersonate the main characters taking journeys of rape and the so-called "ultra-violence". After finally renting it and watching it i finally saw what this film really is: Extremely violent, disturbing and sick but ultimately a genius masterpiece and one of the finest works of cinema ever made. In futuristic Britain, young Alex and his gang enjoy going out at nights and hitting raping and cursing everything in their way, but when Alex is caught by the police for murdering (by accident) one of his victims he is sentenced to 14 years of prison, but when ALex hears about a new method that might help him get out of jail quick, which is an experiment that will eventually make him feel sick every time he gets into a situation that might trigger his violent and sexual desires. Alex agrees but while this method helps get out of jail and diminish his violent desires, it also takes away his humanity from him and his ability to make his own choices which leads society to take advantage of him and unleash its violence on him and Begin went through the experiment, he is left helpless against it. Everything about this film, from the script to the direction to the performances to the soundtrack (relying heavily on Beethoven's 9th symphony), and of course the violent and sexual footage that might disturb to a level that some will find too much, all add up to this films ultimate message: How much can the authorities take over the individual's ability to make his/her own decisions and strip him away from humanity no matter who he or she is. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece lives on and will continue to earn new fans every year, if u haven't seen this film before and have the ability to watch it, do yourself a favor and watch it, fro it is one of the greatest, most thought-provoking films ever made

    Nightmarish, highly stylized and plain bizarre, this remains one of the most controversial motion pictures of all time. Kubrick adapts Anthony Burgess' original novel with more visual flair than we're used to even from him, painting a ghoulish, depraved world in the not so distant future (at least, in 1971) where youth violence has run rampant. Malcolm McDowell, not one to turn down a shocking movie (like Caligula at the end of the decade), stars as the completely messed up sociopath gang leader Alex DeLarge whose various hobbies include hanging out at the local bar and taking illicit substances, classical music, raping women and just beating people for the fun of it. One night, he goes a little too far, which ends up in a trip to jail, where he volunteers for a scientific project designed to make offenders reject violence. After undergoing the experiments he is released and finds himself back on the streets, having to cope with the aftereffects of his actions when running into his old acquaintances, with not so nice results for his health, physically and mentally. The grotesque and haunting visual imagery aside, the film deals with the philosophical matter of freedom of will, as Alex is robbed of his in society's effort to keep kids like him in line, with dire consequences for the now peaceful subjects: are they really 'them' afterwards, being robbed of their choice to be violent or not? Of course most audiences ignored its thematic value and focused too much on Kubrick's portrayal of ruthless violence, which  despite his outrageous displays of 'Verfremdung' to make it easier on the soul  are still quite disturbing, ultimately leading to this film receiving X ratings around the globe and being withdrawn from UK circulation at Kubrick's insistence because it was said to inspire several violent incidents involving youths. It wasn't until Kubrick's death the film was finally allowed to be shown in British movie theaters.

    A film like "A Clockwork Orange" is very hard to bare. With subject matter of this film, it's hard not to. But there is something about "A Clockwork Orange" that pushes it to the edge on a psychological level. It's a misanthropic view of humanity's need to be controlled, and the need for freedom, a "balance" that needs to be made. It's a film that definitely will leave audiences in uncomfortable states of mind, but that is exactly what Stanley Kubrick wanted, and it worked perfectly. "A Clockwork Orange" is about a young criminal named Alex DeLarge who has a lust for "ultraviolence," and engages in the dirtiest of the dirtiest of crimes, assault, rape, murder, violent acts are what get Alex off. After being caught, he is placed in an experimental program where they "sensitize" Alex to the concepts of violence and rape, and the crippled mindset and life he is left. It's hard to find where to start with this film, it's, to a person like me, a perfect film. It gets an incredible emotional rise out of the viewers, and it's intellectually stimulating. The story originally written by Anthony Burgess is the back bone of what helped shaped the hopeful beginnings for this film. The story is perfect, especially for a cinematic style like Stanley Kubrick. The story is engaging for the audience, and is intellectually stimulating, questioning the boundaries between human control and human freedom. Stanley Kubrick is an incredible filmmaker. He has visions of pure genius, and knows exactly how to move his audience, and he does it perfectly with "A Clockwork Orange." He shows you the filth of humanity, and he's not afraid to push your feelings to the boundaries. This is the kind of story that HAD to be made by Stanley Kubrick to be as good as it is, a story as intense as "A Clockwork Orange" deserves to be handled by an intense filmmaker. Malcom McDowell's performance of Alex is excellent. He portrays a cold, lifeless, power hungry, psychopathic criminal with a scary charm, a perfect performance for such a twisted character. The cinematography is unbelievable. A great use of color, and great composition in nearly every shot, very common traits of Stanley Kubrick's films. The cinematography in this film reminds me of the photographic work of William Eggleston for some reason. In Kubrick's black and white films he reminds me more of Robert Frank. The music choice is unbelievable. The synthesized version of "Funeral For Queen Mary" was an interesting choice for a theme song for the film, and Beethoven's 9th Symphony is always an excellent listen, but the contrast between Alex's violence and his love of Beethoven is an interesting clash of ideas. Before I make this review too long, I will go ahead and wrap it up. This is a must see film, despite its "extreme intensity" emotionally on its viewers. It's a true cinematic classic, and will be a perfect example, to me at least, of what true art should be.

    **gives away scenes in the movie** This movie is one of my favorites. It really gets you into the mind of a psychopath and what makes him tick. Every scene of this movie shows just how his mind is set and what exactly he is after. He is violent and aggressive. To me the name of the movie really can say a lot about it. ''Clockwork'' meaning mechanical. When Alex is arrested he is then placed in a mental hospital where they basically brainwash him to be good. Well, what this movie really symbolizes is you can't play the role of God. Alex is being forced to be good when it's not in his nature. ''Orange'' actually represents a person. How their bright and can stand out. They're simply trying to take is individuality away. They're just trying to make him mechanical. After all the therapy and brainwashing he endures he realizes that every time he is exposed to violence he gets ill. And at a few other scenes in the movie you notice he gets ill from hearing Beethoven.(something he actually found beauty in) Which at some point drives him crazy and he attempts suicide. As he lays in the hospital and promises to keep what really happened secret it shows how he is no longer brainwashed. This is shown when they play Beethoven in the background and his sudden vision at the end. It also represents that you can never mold someone into what they are not. You can't change someone if they don't want to be changed. And in the words of the writer Anthony Burgess: "What I was trying to say was that it is better to be bad of one's own free will than to be good through scientific brainwashing" he also says "When Alex has the power of choice, he chooses only violence. But, as his love of music shows, there are other areas of choice."

    A Clockwork Orange isn't an atypical classic because nearly everything you can say about it has already been said. Praising it has become a pretty traditional thing to do, and if you dare criticize it, then you must endure not just the cult-fanbase but the Kubrick-fanbase. I wouldn't wish backlash from both of those groups on an enemy. Howeer, I shouldn't be hearing it from either. Stanley Kubrick's controversial classic is a troubling but required watch, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, which is rumored to be inspired from a personal instance. Burgess's wife was brutally assaulted by a group of thugs at one point, and Burgess tried to penetrate the psychology of such unconscionable men who would dare commit such a disgusting, degrading act. If this is true - and Kubrick left Burgess's message from the novel in tact - then the stance he takes here is stunningly humanistic and brave. The film stars a young, energetic Malcolm McDowell as Alex, a young man who commits unsightly atrocities such as rape and assault upon getting innocent people to open their doors thinking they're doing a helpless soul a favor who they believe was in a car-wreck. He commits these crimes with a gang of men he calls his "droogs," and their spree resorts to an ugly but surprisingly professional scene of rape. During this scene, Alex sings a familiar song you will not see in the same light again (similar to how Alex will later react to a specific song, but I'm getting ahead of myself). Alex is eventually arrested and thrown into prison, but he's given an option upon entering the compound. He can be simply jailed or he can be psychologically conditioned - a new process that can help him - to be good and moral. He chooses to be conditioned and undergoes a series of mentally trying tests that take his individuality, regardless of how despicable it is, along with the basic qualities of him being a human with free-will. After the lengthy psychological processes are complete, he's released back into society as a changed man. Though it predated techno-music pioneer Gary Numan's career by a few years, A Clockwork Orange seems like a cinematic adaptation of one of Numan's darkest, eeriest songs. From the stunningly cold voice of Alex, to the futuristic, dystopian environment, to the beautifully polished set-designs, it seems as if this is a Gary Numan song with the benefit of being a one-hundred and thirty-eight minute music video. All I was waiting for in the end was the Machman to show up. Moreover, the content of this film is widely known to be explicit and still somewhat shocking to this date. But make no mistake in saying the film is mean-spirited just to be mean-spirited. The film's commentary on psychological conditioning taking away human individuality and free will and devaluing ones worth to making him a conforming citizen in a world with diminishing uniqueness is strong and potent. A Clockwork Orange isn't an exploitation film and it isn't a film with violence for violence's sake. The film goes to great lengths to detail psychology and conditioning to the point where it wouldn't be a stretch to name it one of the field's biggest films. The film is also another case where the lead actor and director team up to make an incredible match. Malcolm McDowell gives a tremendous performance here that's troubling, alive, and coldly inspiring. McDowell is only elevated by Stanley Kubrick's typically wide-angle shots and very spacious long shots that show the landscape of the shots and the futuristic design of Kubrick's vision. These talents combined give A Clockwork Orange the strong performance and directorial leverage it needs to communicate its story and message significantly. Finally, it must be said that A Clockwork Orange was going to be a challenge to adapt to the screen no matter assumed what position. The novel is more heavy on the slang than the film, and featured a large glossary in the back of the book defining every word clearly. The film doesn't have that privilege and likely several others that are exclusive to the novel. As all book-to-movie adaptations, the film provides the benefits of a specific (not an absolute, as many confuse) vision of the novel's work and, as a result, may offer the best adaptation one will ever see of the novel. Starring: Malcolm McDowell. Directed by: Stanley Kubrick.

    Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel must rank as one of the most controversial and disturbing mainstream films ever made. Story deals with a young hooligan named Alex(vividly brought to life by Malcolm McDowell) who leads a gang of vicious young British thugs as they mercilessly terrorize various innocent people, when their not fighting with other gangs. Alex breaks up the gang, and is captured by the authorities, who make him the willing subject of an experiment where all the aggressive thoughts are wiped from his mind, leaving him practically helpless later, when he is declared "cured" and sent back into society, where he will then reap what he has sewn... Of course, that's part of the point, that unless you cure society of the very thing you would cure an individual, you will still be left with a problem. Seeing Alex get punished by those he victimized is without doubt satisfying(Charles Bronson would have shot these punks dead without a second thought in his "Death Wish" films!)So Kubrick puts the viewer in the exact position of the avenging victims, which can also be uncomfortable on reflection, but we know exactly what Alex did, though was that part of him really cured? Is it dead? Or can it be revived? The difference between violence being sanctioned or unsanctioned, depending on whether they work for the government or not(as some of the gang will...) Kubrick gives the audience much to consider in this shocking film, not always easy to watch(to say the least) but one that cannot be easily dismissed either, though it was banned for years, but can now be seen on DVD.

I heard about how violent it is and how controversy it caused on it's initial release and its ban (I learned about in my mass media class about violence in the media)even spawning a syndrome in which gangs of young men impersonate the main characters taking journeys of rape and the so-called "ultra-violence". After finally renting it and watching it i finally saw what this film really is: Extremely violent, disturbing and sick but ultimately a genius masterpiece and one of the finest works of cinema ever made. In futuristic Britain, young Alex and his gang enjoy going out at nights and hitting raping and cursing everything in their way, but when Alex is caught by the police for murdering (by accident) one of his victims he is sentenced to 14 years of prison, but when ALex hears about a new method that might help him get out of jail quick, which is an experiment that will eventually make him feel sick every time he gets into a situation that might trigger his violent and sexual desires. Alex agrees but while this method helps get out of jail and diminish his violent desires, it also takes away his humanity from him and his ability to make his own choices which leads society to take advantage of him and unleash its violence on him and Begin went through the experiment, he is left helpless against it. Everything about this film, from the script to the direction to the performances to the soundtrack (relying heavily on Beethoven's 9th symphony), and of course the violent and sexual footage that might disturb to a level that some will find too much, all add up to this films ultimate message: How much can the authorities take over the individual's ability to make his/her own decisions and strip him away from humanity no matter who he or she is. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece lives on and will continue to earn new fans every year, if u haven't seen this film before and have the ability to watch it, do yourself a favor and watch it, fro it is one of the greatest, most thought-provoking films ever made

    Nightmarish, highly stylized and plain bizarre, this remains one of the most controversial motion pictures of all time. Kubrick adapts Anthony Burgess' original novel with more visual flair than we're used to even from him, painting a ghoulish, depraved world in the not so distant future (at least, in 1971) where youth violence has run rampant. Malcolm McDowell, not one to turn down a shocking movie (like Caligula at the end of the decade), stars as the completely messed up sociopath gang leader Alex DeLarge whose various hobbies include hanging out at the local bar and taking illicit substances, classical music, raping women and just beating people for the fun of it. One night, he goes a little too far, which ends up in a trip to jail, where he volunteers for a scientific project designed to make offenders reject violence. After undergoing the experiments he is released and finds himself back on the streets, having to cope with the aftereffects of his actions when running into his old acquaintances, with not so nice results for his health, physically and mentally. The grotesque and haunting visual imagery aside, the film deals with the philosophical matter of freedom of will, as Alex is robbed of his in society's effort to keep kids like him in line, with dire consequences for the now peaceful subjects: are they really 'them' afterwards, being robbed of their choice to be violent or not? Of course most audiences ignored its thematic value and focused too much on Kubrick's portrayal of ruthless violence, which  despite his outrageous displays of 'Verfremdung' to make it easier on the soul  are still quite disturbing, ultimately leading to this film receiving X ratings around the globe and being withdrawn from UK circulation at Kubrick's insistence because it was said to inspire several violent incidents involving youths. It wasn't until Kubrick's death the film was finally allowed to be shown in British movie theaters.

    A film like "A Clockwork Orange" is very hard to bare. With subject matter of this film, it's hard not to. But there is something about "A Clockwork Orange" that pushes it to the edge on a psychological level. It's a misanthropic view of humanity's need to be controlled, and the need for freedom, a "balance" that needs to be made. It's a film that definitely will leave audiences in uncomfortable states of mind, but that is exactly what Stanley Kubrick wanted, and it worked perfectly. "A Clockwork Orange" is about a young criminal named Alex DeLarge who has a lust for "ultraviolence," and engages in the dirtiest of the dirtiest of crimes, assault, rape, murder, violent acts are what get Alex off. After being caught, he is placed in an experimental program where they "sensitize" Alex to the concepts of violence and rape, and the crippled mindset and life he is left. It's hard to find where to start with this film, it's, to a person like me, a perfect film. It gets an incredible emotional rise out of the viewers, and it's intellectually stimulating. The story originally written by Anthony Burgess is the back bone of what helped shaped the hopeful beginnings for this film. The story is perfect, especially for a cinematic style like Stanley Kubrick. The story is engaging for the audience, and is intellectually stimulating, questioning the boundaries between human control and human freedom. Stanley Kubrick is an incredible filmmaker. He has visions of pure genius, and knows exactly how to move his audience, and he does it perfectly with "A Clockwork Orange." He shows you the filth of humanity, and he's not afraid to push your feelings to the boundaries. This is the kind of story that HAD to be made by Stanley Kubrick to be as good as it is, a story as intense as "A Clockwork Orange" deserves to be handled by an intense filmmaker. Malcom McDowell's performance of Alex is excellent. He portrays a cold, lifeless, power hungry, psychopathic criminal with a scary charm, a perfect performance for such a twisted character. The cinematography is unbelievable. A great use of color, and great composition in nearly every shot, very common traits of Stanley Kubrick's films. The cinematography in this film reminds me of the photographic work of William Eggleston for some reason. In Kubrick's black and white films he reminds me more of Robert Frank. The music choice is unbelievable. The synthesized version of "Funeral For Queen Mary" was an interesting choice for a theme song for the film, and Beethoven's 9th Symphony is always an excellent listen, but the contrast between Alex's violence and his love of Beethoven is an interesting clash of ideas. Before I make this review too long, I will go ahead and wrap it up. This is a must see film, despite its "extreme intensity" emotionally on its viewers. It's a true cinematic classic, and will be a perfect example, to me at least, of what true art should be.

    **gives away scenes in the movie** This movie is one of my favorites. It really gets you into the mind of a psychopath and what makes him tick. Every scene of this movie shows just how his mind is set and what exactly he is after. He is violent and aggressive. To me the name of the movie really can say a lot about it. ''Clockwork'' meaning mechanical. When Alex is arrested he is then placed in a mental hospital where they basically brainwash him to be good. Well, what this movie really symbolizes is you can't play the role of God. Alex is being forced to be good when it's not in his nature. ''Orange'' actually represents a person. How their bright and can stand out. They're simply trying to take is individuality away. They're just trying to make him mechanical. After all the therapy and brainwashing he endures he realizes that every time he is exposed to violence he gets ill. And at a few other scenes in the movie you notice he gets ill from hearing Beethoven.(something he actually found beauty in) Which at some point drives him crazy and he attempts suicide. As he lays in the hospital and promises to keep what really happened secret it shows how he is no longer brainwashed. This is shown when they play Beethoven in the background and his sudden vision at the end. It also represents that you can never mold someone into what they are not. You can't change someone if they don't want to be changed. And in the words of the writer Anthony Burgess: "What I was trying to say was that it is better to be bad of one's own free will than to be good through scientific brainwashing" he also says "When Alex has the power of choice, he chooses only violence. But, as his love of music shows, there are other areas of choice."

    A Clockwork Orange isn't an atypical classic because nearly everything you can say about it has already been said. Praising it has become a pretty traditional thing to do, and if you dare criticize it, then you must endure not just the cult-fanbase but the Kubrick-fanbase. I wouldn't wish backlash from both of those groups on an enemy. Howeer, I shouldn't be hearing it from either. Stanley Kubrick's controversial classic is a troubling but required watch, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, which is rumored to be inspired from a personal instance. Burgess's wife was brutally assaulted by a group of thugs at one point, and Burgess tried to penetrate the psychology of such unconscionable men who would dare commit such a disgusting, degrading act. If this is true - and Kubrick left Burgess's message from the novel in tact - then the stance he takes here is stunningly humanistic and brave. The film stars a young, energetic Malcolm McDowell as Alex, a young man who commits unsightly atrocities such as rape and assault upon getting innocent people to open their doors thinking they're doing a helpless soul a favor who they believe was in a car-wreck. He commits these crimes with a gang of men he calls his "droogs," and their spree resorts to an ugly but surprisingly professional scene of rape. During this scene, Alex sings a familiar song you will not see in the same light again (similar to how Alex will later react to a specific song, but I'm getting ahead of myself). Alex is eventually arrested and thrown into prison, but he's given an option upon entering the compound. He can be simply jailed or he can be psychologically conditioned - a new process that can help him - to be good and moral. He chooses to be conditioned and undergoes a series of mentally trying tests that take his individuality, regardless of how despicable it is, along with the basic qualities of him being a human with free-will. After the lengthy psychological processes are complete, he's released back into society as a changed man. Though it predated techno-music pioneer Gary Numan's career by a few years, A Clockwork Orange seems like a cinematic adaptation of one of Numan's darkest, eeriest songs. From the stunningly cold voice of Alex, to the futuristic, dystopian environment, to the beautifully polished set-designs, it seems as if this is a Gary Numan song with the benefit of being a one-hundred and thirty-eight minute music video. All I was waiting for in the end was the Machman to show up. Moreover, the content of this film is widely known to be explicit and still somewhat shocking to this date. But make no mistake in saying the film is mean-spirited just to be mean-spirited. The film's commentary on psychological conditioning taking away human individuality and free will and devaluing ones worth to making him a conforming citizen in a world with diminishing uniqueness is strong and potent. A Clockwork Orange isn't an exploitation film and it isn't a film with violence for violence's sake. The film goes to great lengths to detail psychology and conditioning to the point where it wouldn't be a stretch to name it one of the field's biggest films. The film is also another case where the lead actor and director team up to make an incredible match. Malcolm McDowell gives a tremendous performance here that's troubling, alive, and coldly inspiring. McDowell is only elevated by Stanley Kubrick's typically wide-angle shots and very spacious long shots that show the landscape of the shots and the futuristic design of Kubrick's vision. These talents combined give A Clockwork Orange the strong performance and directorial leverage it needs to communicate its story and message significantly. Finally, it must be said that A Clockwork Orange was going to be a challenge to adapt to the screen no matter assumed what position. The novel is more heavy on the slang than the film, and featured a large glossary in the back of the book defining every word clearly. The film doesn't have that privilege and likely several others that are exclusive to the novel. As all book-to-movie adaptations, the film provides the benefits of a specific (not an absolute, as many confuse) vision of the novel's work and, as a result, may offer the best adaptation one will ever see of the novel. Starring: Malcolm McDowell. Directed by: Stanley Kubrick.

    Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel must rank as one of the most controversial and disturbing mainstream films ever made. Story deals with a young hooligan named Alex(vividly brought to life by Malcolm McDowell) who leads a gang of vicious young British thugs as they mercilessly terrorize various innocent people, when their not fighting with other gangs. Alex breaks up the gang, and is captured by the authorities, who make him the willing subject of an experiment where all the aggressive thoughts are wiped from his mind, leaving him practically helpless later, when he is declared "cured" and sent back into society, where he will then reap what he has sewn... Of course, that's part of the point, that unless you cure society of the very thing you would cure an individual, you will still be left with a problem. Seeing Alex get punished by those he victimized is without doubt satisfying(Charles Bronson would have shot these punks dead without a second thought in his "Death Wish" films!)So Kubrick puts the viewer in the exact position of the avenging victims, which can also be uncomfortable on reflection, but we know exactly what Alex did, though was that part of him really cured? Is it dead? Or can it be revived? The difference between violence being sanctioned or unsanctioned, depending on whether they work for the government or not(as some of the gang will...) Kubrick gives the audience much to consider in this shocking film, not always easy to watch(to say the least) but one that cannot be easily dismissed either, though it was banned for years, but can now be seen on DVD.

    Stanley Kubrick manages to create an incredibly; questionable atmosphere throughout the film. Though it may be intended in the novel to represent a future Britain, the film still uses 70's fashion, style and architect, with much stronger and colourful sexual nature. Malcolm McDowell's delivery of the characteristics of Alex are truly extraordinary. Of course his physical traits allow him to portray Alex, whereas, his psychological traits portray a remarkable; gentlemanly character. As a matter of fact, Alex appears to be delinquent with an isolated soul. The scenes of sexual and violent nature can be perceived as 'Disturbing', though Kubrick has appeared to have used mild black comedy to prevent fear and worry of the audiences own safety. The locations used in A Clockwork Orange all have the 'groovy' colour and style that surprisingly creates a cold unwelcoming atmosphere. Which gives off the feeling that the country has fallen and will not be restored to its safe state. All in all, the film can leave one feeling confused and cold. Though it is a must-see, and well worth your time. An absolute work of art.

    This witty and stylistic film inspired many of the new age filmmakers and actors over the years. Murder, Rape, Violence, Sex, and Mental disease all in one cluster made film. This film made by Stanley Kubrick, adapted from Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel, follows charismatic delinquent that is jailed and volunteers for an experimental aversion therapy developed by the government in an effort to solve society's crime problem, but once his problem is cured if follows the horrid aftermath of things that happen to him once he's "cured". You go from hating and even being envious of this character to hating him some more, but once cured you feel sympathy for the terrible things that happens to him, but know he deserves it.

    Stanley Kubrick always knew how to use music in his films and "A Clockwork Orange" is no exception--Most of the music was written by Walter Carlos (of 'Switched On Bach' album fame) who later changed his sex and became Wendy Carlos..What's so fantastic is the way the music draws you in and never lets go throughout the film (especially in the scenes where Alex is forced to sit in a 'dentist' type chair, get eye drops put in, and forced to watch past history experiences of "Ultra Violence" which include some disturbing scenes of Hitler's rise to power during WWII)...If there was a separate rating for this film's musical score, I'd give it 10/10 stars!

    On any list of controversial films released, it's nearly guaranteed to find Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange somewhere on the list, most likely near the top. Kubrick's classic adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel of the same name is often regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time, but also as one of the most controversial. Brutal violence and sexuality feature prominently within A Clockwork Orange, which caused the film to be withdrawn from British cinemas until Kubrick's death in 1999. Regardless of the extreme violence and sexuality, A Clockwork Orange is one of Kubrick's finest hours and is one of cinema's greatest outings. Following the Burgess novel, A Clockwork Orange is set in a dystopian London in the near future. In this dystopia, Alex DeLarge and his group of "droogs" frequently roam the city and commit acts of "ultra-violence" after stopping by the Korova milk bar to drink intoxicated "milk plus." Just a young teenager, Alex's favorite pastimes include brutality of innocent citizens, rape and sexuality, and classical music, most notably Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex has no sympathy for any of his victims as he commits new crimes each and every night. During one of his midnight assaults, Alex is taken into custody by the police. Sentenced to fourteen years in prison, Alex finds a way to escape back into society though the experimental Ludovico Treatment. A kind of aversion therapy, the Ludovico Treatment is successful as Alex becomes the clockwork orange of society. However, the changes brought on by the government will leave lasting changes on Alex and the new society he enters, with some interesting results. Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel is fantastic, and is one of Kubrick's more faithful adaptations. The writing executes the extremely engrossing story very well, keeping you immersed and fascinated by the characters and events going on. The film makes smooth transitions from the different acts, each of which is nothing like the other. Dialogue between characters is very well written, often with some of Kubrick's dark humor. The use of nadsat, a fictional language used by Alex and his droogs, is used frequently, but works very well without becoming overwhelming. The most important aspect of A Clockwork Orange's writing is the themes of the story itself. Ultimately, the film asks whether it is right to take away one's freedom for the good of everyone else. The stand out of A Clockwork Orange is the amazing performance from Malcolm McDowell as Alex. As sadistic and twisted the character is, you can't help but feel sympathetic for him when he's freedom is forced away from him at the hands of others, and McDowell is certainly a driving force in this characteristic. Every line McDowell delivers is memorable and amazing. McDowell completely embodies the character of Alex, something most actors can never do in their roles. In fact, there's not a single actor that would have been a better fit for Alex than McDowell. It's no wonder the character of Alex is so beloved among the cult following A Clockwork Orange has. Another superb element of A Clockwork Orange is the choice of music. Like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film doesn't create an entirely original score, but rather uses classic pieces of music mixed in with synthesized pieces by composer Walter Carlos (later known as Wendy Carlos). Every song is perfectly edited in with the wonderful Kubrick visuals to create a perfect combination. Henry Purcell's Funeral of Queen Mary serves as the perfect introduction for the movie in every way. A sped up version of the William Tell Overture is used during a fast motion sex scene, and Beethoven's symphonies are used prominently. Easily the most recognizable, and infamous, piece in the movie is Singin in the Rain, which is used in a disturbingly effective way during a rape scene. Everything about A Clockwork Orange embodies Kubrick's perfectionism and greatness. Kubrick would go on and make movies until his untimely death, but A Clockwork Orange stands as Kubrick's finest work. The story is told with both fantastic writing and the visual style we've come to expect from Stanley Kubrick. Top it off with a Golden Globe nominated (and Oscar worthy) performance by Malcolm McDowell and perfectly chosen music tracks and you've got a classic piece of film history. There are simply no words to describe A Clockwork Orange's greatness.

    A Clockwork Orange isn't an atypical classic because nearly everything you can say about it has already been said. Praising it has become a pretty traditional thing to do, and if you dare criticize it, then you must endure not just the cult-fanbase but the Kubrick-fanbase. I wouldn't wish backlash from both of those groups on an enemy. Howeer, I shouldn't be hearing it from either. Stanley Kubrick's controversial classic is a troubling but required watch, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, which is rumored to be inspired from a personal instance. Burgess's wife was brutally assaulted by a group of thugs at one point, and Burgess tried to penetrate the psychology of such unconscionable men who would dare commit such a disgusting, degrading act. If this is true - and Kubrick left Burgess's message from the novel in tact - then the stance he takes here is stunningly humanistic and brave. The film stars a young, energetic Malcolm McDowell as Alex, a young man who commits unsightly atrocities such as rape and assault upon getting innocent people to open their doors thinking they're doing a helpless soul a favor who they believe was in a car-wreck. He commits these crimes with a gang of men he calls his "droogs," and their spree resorts to an ugly but surprisingly professional scene of rape. During this scene, Alex sings a familiar song you will not see in the same light again (similar to how Alex will later react to a specific song, but I'm getting ahead of myself). Alex is eventually arrested and thrown into prison, but he's given an option upon entering the compound. He can be simply jailed or he can be psychologically conditioned - a new process that can help him - to be good and moral. He chooses to be conditioned and undergoes a series of mentally trying tests that take his individuality, regardless of how despicable it is, along with the basic qualities of him being a human with free-will. After the lengthy psychological processes are complete, he's released back into society as a changed man. Though it predated techno-music pioneer Gary Numan's career by a few years, A Clockwork Orange seems like a cinematic adaptation of one of Numan's darkest, eeriest songs. From the stunningly cold voice of Alex, to the futuristic, dystopian environment, to the beautifully polished set-designs, it seems as if this is a Gary Numan song with the benefit of being a one-hundred and thirty-eight minute music video. All I was waiting for in the end was the Machman to show up. Moreover, the content of this film is widely known to be explicit and still somewhat shocking to this date. But make no mistake in saying the film is mean-spirited just to be mean-spirited. The film's commentary on psychological conditioning taking away human individuality and free will and devaluing ones worth to making him a conforming citizen in a world with diminishing uniqueness is strong and potent. A Clockwork Orange isn't an exploitation film and it isn't a film with violence for violence's sake. The film goes to great lengths to detail psychology and conditioning to the point where it wouldn't be a stretch to name it one of the field's biggest films. The film is also another case where the lead actor and director team up to make an incredible match. Malcolm McDowell gives a tremendous performance here that's troubling, alive, and coldly inspiring. McDowell is only elevated by Stanley Kubrick's typically wide-angle shots and very spacious long shots that show the landscape of the shots and the futuristic design of Kubrick's vision. These talents combined give A Clockwork Orange the strong performance and directorial leverage it needs to communicate its story and message significantly. Finally, it must be said that A Clockwork Orange was going to be a challenge to adapt to the screen no matter assumed what position. The novel is more heavy on the slang than the film, and featured a large glossary in the back of the book defining every word clearly. The film doesn't have that privilege and likely several others that are exclusive to the novel. As all book-to-movie adaptations, the film provides the benefits of a specific (not an absolute, as many confuse) vision of the novel's work and, as a result, may offer the best adaptation one will ever see of the novel. Starring: Malcolm McDowell. Directed by: Stanley Kubrick.

    Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel must rank as one of the most controversial and disturbing mainstream films ever made. Story deals with a young hooligan named Alex(vividly brought to life by Malcolm McDowell) who leads a gang of vicious young British thugs as they mercilessly terrorize various innocent people, when their not fighting with other gangs. Alex breaks up the gang, and is captured by the authorities, who make him the willing subject of an experiment where all the aggressive thoughts are wiped from his mind, leaving him practically helpless later, when he is declared "cured" and sent back into society, where he will then reap what he has sewn... Of course, that's part of the point, that unless you cure society of the very thing you would cure an individual, you will still be left with a problem. Seeing Alex get punished by those he victimized is without doubt satisfying(Charles Bronson would have shot these punks dead without a second thought in his "Death Wish" films!)So Kubrick puts the viewer in the exact position of the avenging victims, which can also be uncomfortable on reflection, but we know exactly what Alex did, though was that part of him really cured? Is it dead? Or can it be revived? The difference between violence being sanctioned or unsanctioned, depending on whether they work for the government or not(as some of the gang will...) Kubrick gives the audience much to consider in this shocking film, not always easy to watch(to say the least) but one that cannot be easily dismissed either, though it was banned for years, but can now be seen on DVD.

    Stanley Kubrick manages to create an incredibly; questionable atmosphere throughout the film. Though it may be intended in the novel to represent a future Britain, the film still uses 70's fashion, style and architect, with much stronger and colourful sexual nature. Malcolm McDowell's delivery of the characteristics of Alex are truly extraordinary. Of course his physical traits allow him to portray Alex, whereas, his psychological traits portray a remarkable; gentlemanly character. As a matter of fact, Alex appears to be delinquent with an isolated soul. The scenes of sexual and violent nature can be perceived as 'Disturbing', though Kubrick has appeared to have used mild black comedy to prevent fear and worry of the audiences own safety. The locations used in A Clockwork Orange all have the 'groovy' colour and style that surprisingly creates a cold unwelcoming atmosphere. Which gives off the feeling that the country has fallen and will not be restored to its safe state. All in all, the film can leave one feeling confused and cold. Though it is a must-see, and well worth your time. An absolute work of art.

    This witty and stylistic film inspired many of the new age filmmakers and actors over the years. Murder, Rape, Violence, Sex, and Mental disease all in one cluster made film. This film made by Stanley Kubrick, adapted from Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel, follows charismatic delinquent that is jailed and volunteers for an experimental aversion therapy developed by the government in an effort to solve society's crime problem, but once his problem is cured if follows the horrid aftermath of things that happen to him once he's "cured". You go from hating and even being envious of this character to hating him some more, but once cured you feel sympathy for the terrible things that happens to him, but know he deserves it.

    Stanley Kubrick always knew how to use music in his films and "A Clockwork Orange" is no exception--Most of the music was written by Walter Carlos (of 'Switched On Bach' album fame) who later changed his sex and became Wendy Carlos..What's so fantastic is the way the music draws you in and never lets go throughout the film (especially in the scenes where Alex is forced to sit in a 'dentist' type chair, get eye drops put in, and forced to watch past history experiences of "Ultra Violence" which include some disturbing scenes of Hitler's rise to power during WWII)...If there was a separate rating for this film's musical score, I'd give it 10/10 stars!

    On any list of controversial films released, it's nearly guaranteed to find Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange somewhere on the list, most likely near the top. Kubrick's classic adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel of the same name is often regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time, but also as one of the most controversial. Brutal violence and sexuality feature prominently within A Clockwork Orange, which caused the film to be withdrawn from British cinemas until Kubrick's death in 1999. Regardless of the extreme violence and sexuality, A Clockwork Orange is one of Kubrick's finest hours and is one of cinema's greatest outings. Following the Burgess novel, A Clockwork Orange is set in a dystopian London in the near future. In this dystopia, Alex DeLarge and his group of "droogs" frequently roam the city and commit acts of "ultra-violence" after stopping by the Korova milk bar to drink intoxicated "milk plus." Just a young teenager, Alex's favorite pastimes include brutality of innocent citizens, rape and sexuality, and classical music, most notably Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex has no sympathy for any of his victims as he commits new crimes each and every night. During one of his midnight assaults, Alex is taken into custody by the police. Sentenced to fourteen years in prison, Alex finds a way to escape back into society though the experimental Ludovico Treatment. A kind of aversion therapy, the Ludovico Treatment is successful as Alex becomes the clockwork orange of society. However, the changes brought on by the government will leave lasting changes on Alex and the new society he enters, with some interesting results. Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel is fantastic, and is one of Kubrick's more faithful adaptations. The writing executes the extremely engrossing story very well, keeping you immersed and fascinated by the characters and events going on. The film makes smooth transitions from the different acts, each of which is nothing like the other. Dialogue between characters is very well written, often with some of Kubrick's dark humor. The use of nadsat, a fictional language used by Alex and his droogs, is used frequently, but works very well without becoming overwhelming. The most important aspect of A Clockwork Orange's writing is the themes of the story itself. Ultimately, the film asks whether it is right to take away one's freedom for the good of everyone else. The stand out of A Clockwork Orange is the amazing performance from Malcolm McDowell as Alex. As sadistic and twisted the character is, you can't help but feel sympathetic for him when he's freedom is forced away from him at the hands of others, and McDowell is certainly a driving force in this characteristic. Every line McDowell delivers is memorable and amazing. McDowell completely embodies the character of Alex, something most actors can never do in their roles. In fact, there's not a single actor that would have been a better fit for Alex than McDowell. It's no wonder the character of Alex is so beloved among the cult following A Clockwork Orange has. Another superb element of A Clockwork Orange is the choice of music. Like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film doesn't create an entirely original score, but rather uses classic pieces of music mixed in with synthesized pieces by composer Walter Carlos (later known as Wendy Carlos). Every song is perfectly edited in with the wonderful Kubrick visuals to create a perfect combination. Henry Purcell's Funeral of Queen Mary serves as the perfect introduction for the movie in every way. A sped up version of the William Tell Overture is used during a fast motion sex scene, and Beethoven's symphonies are used prominently. Easily the most recognizable, and infamous, piece in the movie is Singin in the Rain, which is used in a disturbingly effective way during a rape scene. Everything about A Clockwork Orange embodies Kubrick's perfectionism and greatness. Kubrick would go on and make movies until his untimely death, but A Clockwork Orange stands as Kubrick's finest work. The story is told with both fantastic writing and the visual style we've come to expect from Stanley Kubrick. Top it off with a Golden Globe nominated (and Oscar worthy) performance by Malcolm McDowell and perfectly chosen music tracks and you've got a classic piece of film history. There are simply no words to describe A Clockwork Orange's greatness.

    I have heard a lot about this movie before i've decided to rent it a few days earlier. I heard about how violent it is and how controversy it caused on it's initial release and its ban (I learned about in my mass media class about violence in the media)even spawning a syndrome in which gangs of young men impersonate the main characters taking journeys of rape and the so-called "ultra-violence". After finally renting it and watching it i finally saw what this film really is: Extremely violent, disturbing and sick but ultimately a genius masterpiece and one of the finest works of cinema ever made. In futuristic Britain, young Alex and his gang enjoy going out at nights and hitting raping and cursing everything in their way, but when Alex is caught by the police for murdering (by accident) one of his victims he is sentenced to 14 years of prison, but when ALex hears about a new method that might help him get out of jail quick, which is an experiment that will eventually make him feel sick every time he gets into a situation that might trigger his violent and sexual desires. Alex agrees but while this method helps get out of jail and diminish his violent desires, it also takes away his humanity from him and his ability to make his own choices which leads society to take advantage of him and unleash its violence on him and Begin went through the experiment, he is left helpless against it. Everything about this film, from the script to the direction to the performances to the soundtrack (relying heavily on Beethoven's 9th symphony), and of course the violent and sexual footage that might disturb to a level that some will find too much, all add up to this films ultimate message: How much can the authorities take over the individual's ability to make his/her own decisions and strip him away from humanity no matter who he or she is. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece lives on and will continue to earn new fans every year, if u haven't seen this film before and have the ability to watch it, do yourself a favor and watch it, fro it is one of the greatest, most thought-provoking films ever made

    Nightmarish, highly stylized and plain bizarre, this remains one of the most controversial motion pictures of all time. Kubrick adapts Anthony Burgess' original novel with more visual flair than we're used to even from him, painting a ghoulish, depraved world in the not so distant future (at least, in 1971) where youth violence has run rampant. Malcolm McDowell, not one to turn down a shocking movie (like Caligula at the end of the decade), stars as the completely messed up sociopath gang leader Alex DeLarge whose various hobbies include hanging out at the local bar and taking illicit substances, classical music, raping women and just beating people for the fun of it. One night, he goes a little too far, which ends up in a trip to jail, where he volunteers for a scientific project designed to make offenders reject violence. After undergoing the experiments he is released and finds himself back on the streets, having to cope with the aftereffects of his actions when running into his old acquaintances, with not so nice results for his health, physically and mentally. The grotesque and haunting visual imagery aside, the film deals with the philosophical matter of freedom of will, as Alex is robbed of his in society's effort to keep kids like him in line, with dire consequences for the now peaceful subjects: are they really 'them' afterwards, being robbed of their choice to be violent or not? Of course most audiences ignored its thematic value and focused too much on Kubrick's portrayal of ruthless violence, which  despite his outrageous displays of 'Verfremdung' to make it easier on the soul  are still quite disturbing, ultimately leading to this film receiving X ratings around the globe and being withdrawn from UK circulation at Kubrick's insistence because it was said to inspire several violent incidents involving youths. It wasn't until Kubrick's death the film was finally allowed to be shown in British movie theaters.

    A film like "A Clockwork Orange" is very hard to bare. With subject matter of this film, it's hard not to. But there is something about "A Clockwork Orange" that pushes it to the edge on a psychological level. It's a misanthropic view of humanity's need to be controlled, and the need for freedom, a "balance" that needs to be made. It's a film that definitely will leave audiences in uncomfortable states of mind, but that is exactly what Stanley Kubrick wanted, and it worked perfectly. "A Clockwork Orange" is about a young criminal named Alex DeLarge who has a lust for "ultraviolence," and engages in the dirtiest of the dirtiest of crimes, assault, rape, murder, violent acts are what get Alex off. After being caught, he is placed in an experimental program where they "sensitize" Alex to the concepts of violence and rape, and the crippled mindset and life he is left. It's hard to find where to start with this film, it's, to a person like me, a perfect film. It gets an incredible emotional rise out of the viewers, and it's intellectually stimulating. The story originally written by Anthony Burgess is the back bone of what helped shaped the hopeful beginnings for this film. The story is perfect, especially for a cinematic style like Stanley Kubrick. The story is engaging for the audience, and is intellectually stimulating, questioning the boundaries between human control and human freedom. Stanley Kubrick is an incredible filmmaker. He has visions of pure genius, and knows exactly how to move his audience, and he does it perfectly with "A Clockwork Orange." He shows you the filth of humanity, and he's not afraid to push your feelings to the boundaries. This is the kind of story that HAD to be made by Stanley Kubrick to be as good as it is, a story as intense as "A Clockwork Orange" deserves to be handled by an intense filmmaker. Malcom McDowell's performance of Alex is excellent. He portrays a cold, lifeless, power hungry, psychopathic criminal with a scary charm, a perfect performance for such a twisted character. The cinematography is unbelievable. A great use of color, and great composition in nearly every shot, very common traits of Stanley Kubrick's films. The cinematography in this film reminds me of the photographic work of William Eggleston for some reason. In Kubrick's black and white films he reminds me more of Robert Frank. The music choice is unbelievable. The synthesized version of "Funeral For Queen Mary" was an interesting choice for a theme song for the film, and Beethoven's 9th Symphony is always an excellent listen, but the contrast between Alex's violence and his love of Beethoven is an interesting clash of ideas. Before I make this review too long, I will go ahead and wrap it up. This is a must see film, despite its "extreme intensity" emotionally on its viewers. It's a true cinematic classic, and will be a perfect example, to me at least, of what true art should be.

    **gives away scenes in the movie** This movie is one of my favorites. It really gets you into the mind of a psychopath and what makes him tick. Every scene of this movie shows just how his mind is set and what exactly he is after. He is violent and aggressive. To me the name of the movie really can say a lot about it. ''Clockwork'' meaning mechanical. When Alex is arrested he is then placed in a mental hospital where they basically brainwash him to be good. Well, what this movie really symbolizes is you can't play the role of God. Alex is being forced to be good when it's not in his nature. ''Orange'' actually represents a person. How their bright and can stand out. They're simply trying to take is individuality away. They're just trying to make him mechanical. After all the therapy and brainwashing he endures he realizes that every time he is exposed to violence he gets ill. And at a few other scenes in the movie you notice he gets ill from hearing Beethoven.(something he actually found beauty in) Which at some point drives him crazy and he attempts suicide. As he lays in the hospital and promises to keep what really happened secret it shows how he is no longer brainwashed. This is shown when they play Beethoven in the background and his sudden vision at the end. It also represents that you can never mold someone into what they are not. You can't change someone if they don't want to be changed. And in the words of the writer Anthony Burgess: "What I was trying to say was that it is better to be bad of one's own free will than to be good through scientific brainwashing" he also says "When Alex has the power of choice, he chooses only violence. But, as his love of music shows, there are other areas of choice."

    Stanley Kubrick always knew how to use music in his films and "A Clockwork Orange" is no exception--Most of the music was written by Walter Carlos (of 'Switched On Bach' album fame) who later changed his sex and became Wendy Carlos..What's so fantastic is the way the music draws you in and never lets go throughout the film (especially in the scenes where Alex is forced to sit in a 'dentist' type chair, get eye drops put in, and forced to watch past history experiences of "Ultra Violence" which include some disturbing scenes of Hitler's rise to power during WWII)...If there was a separate rating for this film's musical score, I'd give it 10/10 stars!

    On any list of controversial films released, it's nearly guaranteed to find Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange somewhere on the list, most likely near the top. Kubrick's classic adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel of the same name is often regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time, but also as one of the most controversial. Brutal violence and sexuality feature prominently within A Clockwork Orange, which caused the film to be withdrawn from British cinemas until Kubrick's death in 1999. Regardless of the extreme violence and sexuality, A Clockwork Orange is one of Kubrick's finest hours and is one of cinema's greatest outings. Following the Burgess novel, A Clockwork Orange is set in a dystopian London in the near future. In this dystopia, Alex DeLarge and his group of "droogs" frequently roam the city and commit acts of "ultra-violence" after stopping by the Korova milk bar to drink intoxicated "milk plus." Just a young teenager, Alex's favorite pastimes include brutality of innocent citizens, rape and sexuality, and classical music, most notably Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex has no sympathy for any of his victims as he commits new crimes each and every night. During one of his midnight assaults, Alex is taken into custody by the police. Sentenced to fourteen years in prison, Alex finds a way to escape back into society though the experimental Ludovico Treatment. A kind of aversion therapy, the Ludovico Treatment is successful as Alex becomes the clockwork orange of society. However, the changes brought on by the government will leave lasting changes on Alex and the new society he enters, with some interesting results. Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel is fantastic, and is one of Kubrick's more faithful adaptations. The writing executes the extremely engrossing story very well, keeping you immersed and fascinated by the characters and events going on. The film makes smooth transitions from the different acts, each of which is nothing like the other. Dialogue between characters is very well written, often with some of Kubrick's dark humor. The use of nadsat, a fictional language used by Alex and his droogs, is used frequently, but works very well without becoming overwhelming. The most important aspect of A Clockwork Orange's writing is the themes of the story itself. Ultimately, the film asks whether it is right to take away one's freedom for the good of everyone else. The stand out of A Clockwork Orange is the amazing performance from Malcolm McDowell as Alex. As sadistic and twisted the character is, you can't help but feel sympathetic for him when he's freedom is forced away from him at the hands of others, and McDowell is certainly a driving force in this characteristic. Every line McDowell delivers is memorable and amazing. McDowell completely embodies the character of Alex, something most actors can never do in their roles. In fact, there's not a single actor that would have been a better fit for Alex than McDowell. It's no wonder the character of Alex is so beloved among the cult following A Clockwork Orange has. Another superb element of A Clockwork Orange is the choice of music. Like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film doesn't create an entirely original score, but rather uses classic pieces of music mixed in with synthesized pieces by composer Walter Carlos (later known as Wendy Carlos). Every song is perfectly edited in with the wonderful Kubrick visuals to create a perfect combination. Henry Purcell's Funeral of Queen Mary serves as the perfect introduction for the movie in every way. A sped up version of the William Tell Overture is used during a fast motion sex scene, and Beethoven's symphonies are used prominently. Easily the most recognizable, and infamous, piece in the movie is Singin in the Rain, which is used in a disturbingly effective way during a rape scene. Everything about A Clockwork Orange embodies Kubrick's perfectionism and greatness. Kubrick would go on and make movies until his untimely death, but A Clockwork Orange stands as Kubrick's finest work. The story is told with both fantastic writing and the visual style we've come to expect from Stanley Kubrick. Top it off with a Golden Globe nominated (and Oscar worthy) performance by Malcolm McDowell and perfectly chosen music tracks and you've got a classic piece of film history. There are simply no words to describe A Clockwork Orange's greatness.

    I have heard a lot about this movie before i've decided to rent it a few days earlier. I heard about how violent it is and how controversy it caused on it's initial release and its ban (I learned about in my mass media class about violence in the media)even spawning a syndrome in which gangs of young men impersonate the main characters taking journeys of rape and the so-called "ultra-violence". After finally renting it and watching it i finally saw what this film really is: Extremely violent, disturbing and sick but ultimately a genius masterpiece and one of the finest works of cinema ever made. In futuristic Britain, young Alex and his gang enjoy going out at nights and hitting raping and cursing everything in their way, but when Alex is caught by the police for murdering (by accident) one of his victims he is sentenced to 14 years of prison, but when ALex hears about a new method that might help him get out of jail quick, which is an experiment that will eventually make him feel sick every time he gets into a situation that might trigger his violent and sexual desires. Alex agrees but while this method helps get out of jail and diminish his violent desires, it also takes away his humanity from him and his ability to make his own choices which leads society to take advantage of him and unleash its violence on him and Begin went through the experiment, he is left helpless against it. Everything about this film, from the script to the direction to the performances to the soundtrack (relying heavily on Beethoven's 9th symphony), and of course the violent and sexual footage that might disturb to a level that some will find too much, all add up to this films ultimate message: How much can the authorities take over the individual's ability to make his/her own decisions and strip him away from humanity no matter who he or she is. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece lives on and will continue to earn new fans every year, if u haven't seen this film before and have the ability to watch it, do yourself a favor and watch it, fro it is one of the greatest, most thought-provoking films ever made

    Nightmarish, highly stylized and plain bizarre, this remains one of the most controversial motion pictures of all time. Kubrick adapts Anthony Burgess' original novel with more visual flair than we're used to even from him, painting a ghoulish, depraved world in the not so distant future (at least, in 1971) where youth violence has run rampant. Malcolm McDowell, not one to turn down a shocking movie (like Caligula at the end of the decade), stars as the completely messed up sociopath gang leader Alex DeLarge whose various hobbies include hanging out at the local bar and taking illicit substances, classical music, raping women and just beating people for the fun of it. One night, he goes a little too far, which ends up in a trip to jail, where he volunteers for a scientific project designed to make offenders reject violence. After undergoing the experiments he is released and finds himself back on the streets, having to cope with the aftereffects of his actions when running into his old acquaintances, with not so nice results for his health, physically and mentally. The grotesque and haunting visual imagery aside, the film deals with the philosophical matter of freedom of will, as Alex is robbed of his in society's effort to keep kids like him in line, with dire consequences for the now peaceful subjects: are they really 'them' afterwards, being robbed of their choice to be violent or not? Of course most audiences ignored its thematic value and focused too much on Kubrick's portrayal of ruthless violence, which  despite his outrageous displays of 'Verfremdung' to make it easier on the soul  are still quite disturbing, ultimately leading to this film receiving X ratings around the globe and being withdrawn from UK circulation at Kubrick's insistence because it was said to inspire several violent incidents involving youths. It wasn't until Kubrick's death the film was finally allowed to be shown in British movie theaters.

    A film like "A Clockwork Orange" is very hard to bare. With subject matter of this film, it's hard not to. But there is something about "A Clockwork Orange" that pushes it to the edge on a psychological level. It's a misanthropic view of humanity's need to be controlled, and the need for freedom, a "balance" that needs to be made. It's a film that definitely will leave audiences in uncomfortable states of mind, but that is exactly what Stanley Kubrick wanted, and it worked perfectly. "A Clockwork Orange" is about a young criminal named Alex DeLarge who has a lust for "ultraviolence," and engages in the dirtiest of the dirtiest of crimes, assault, rape, murder, violent acts are what get Alex off. After being caught, he is placed in an experimental program where they "sensitize" Alex to the concepts of violence and rape, and the crippled mindset and life he is left. It's hard to find where to start with this film, it's, to a person like me, a perfect film. It gets an incredible emotional rise out of the viewers, and it's intellectually stimulating. The story originally written by Anthony Burgess is the back bone of what helped shaped the hopeful beginnings for this film. The story is perfect, especially for a cinematic style like Stanley Kubrick. The story is engaging for the audience, and is intellectually stimulating, questioning the boundaries between human control and human freedom. Stanley Kubrick is an incredible filmmaker. He has visions of pure genius, and knows exactly how to move his audience, and he does it perfectly with "A Clockwork Orange." He shows you the filth of humanity, and he's not afraid to push your feelings to the boundaries. This is the kind of story that HAD to be made by Stanley Kubrick to be as good as it is, a story as intense as "A Clockwork Orange" deserves to be handled by an intense filmmaker. Malcom McDowell's performance of Alex is excellent. He portrays a cold, lifeless, power hungry, psychopathic criminal with a scary charm, a perfect performance for such a twisted character. The cinematography is unbelievable. A great use of color, and great composition in nearly every shot, very common traits of Stanley Kubrick's films. The cinematography in this film reminds me of the photographic work of William Eggleston for some reason. In Kubrick's black and white films he reminds me more of Robert Frank. The music choice is unbelievable. The synthesized version of "Funeral For Queen Mary" was an interesting choice for a theme song for the film, and Beethoven's 9th Symphony is always an excellent listen, but the contrast between Alex's violence and his love of Beethoven is an interesting clash of ideas. Before I make this review too long, I will go ahead and wrap it up. This is a must see film, despite its "extreme intensity" emotionally on its viewers. It's a true cinematic classic, and will be a perfect example, to me at least, of what true art should be.

    **gives away scenes in the movie** This movie is one of my favorites. It really gets you into the mind of a psychopath and what makes him tick. Every scene of this movie shows just how his mind is set and what exactly he is after. He is violent and aggressive. To me the name of the movie really can say a lot about it. ''Clockwork'' meaning mechanical. When Alex is arrested he is then placed in a mental hospital where they basically brainwash him to be good. Well, what this movie really symbolizes is you can't play the role of God. Alex is being forced to be good when it's not in his nature. ''Orange'' actually represents a person. How their bright and can stand out. They're simply trying to take is individuality away. They're just trying to make him mechanical. After all the therapy and brainwashing he endures he realizes that every time he is exposed to violence he gets ill. And at a few other scenes in the movie you notice he gets ill from hearing Beethoven.(something he actually found beauty in) Which at some point drives him crazy and he attempts suicide. As he lays in the hospital and promises to keep what really happened secret it shows how he is no longer brainwashed. This is shown when they play Beethoven in the background and his sudden vision at the end. It also represents that you can never mold someone into what they are not. You can't change someone if they don't want to be changed. And in the words of the writer Anthony Burgess: "What I was trying to say was that it is better to be bad of one's own free will than to be good through scientific brainwashing" he also says "When Alex has the power of choice, he chooses only violence. But, as his love of music shows, there are other areas of choice."

    A Clockwork Orange isn't an atypical classic because nearly everything you can say about it has already been said. Praising it has become a pretty traditional thing to do, and if you dare criticize it, then you must endure not just the cult-fanbase but the Kubrick-fanbase. I wouldn't wish backlash from both of those groups on an enemy. Howeer, I shouldn't be hearing it from either. Stanley Kubrick's controversial classic is a troubling but required watch, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, which is rumored to be inspired from a personal instance. Burgess's wife was brutally assaulted by a group of thugs at one point, and Burgess tried to penetrate the psychology of such unconscionable men who would dare commit such a disgusting, degrading act. If this is true - and Kubrick left Burgess's message from the novel in tact - then the stance he takes here is stunningly humanistic and brave. The film stars a young, energetic Malcolm McDowell as Alex, a young man who commits unsightly atrocities such as rape and assault upon getting innocent people to open their doors thinking they're doing a helpless soul a favor who they believe was in a car-wreck. He commits these crimes with a gang of men he calls his "droogs," and their spree resorts to an ugly but surprisingly professional scene of rape. During this scene, Alex sings a familiar song you will not see in the same light again (similar to how Alex will later react to a specific song, but I'm getting ahead of myself). Alex is eventually arrested and thrown into prison, but he's given an option upon entering the compound. He can be simply jailed or he can be psychologically conditioned - a new process that can help him - to be good and moral. He chooses to be conditioned and undergoes a series of mentally trying tests that take his individuality, regardless of how despicable it is, along with the basic qualities of him being a human with free-will. After the lengthy psychological processes are complete, he's released back into society as a changed man. Though it predated techno-music pioneer Gary Numan's career by a few years, A Clockwork Orange seems like a cinematic adaptation of one of Numan's darkest, eeriest songs. From the stunningly cold voice of Alex, to the futuristic, dystopian environment, to the beautifully polished set-designs, it seems as if this is a Gary Numan song with the benefit of being a one-hundred and thirty-eight minute music video. All I was waiting for in the end was the Machman to show up. Moreover, the content of this film is widely known to be explicit and still somewhat shocking to this date. But make no mistake in saying the film is mean-spirited just to be mean-spirited. The film's commentary on psychological conditioning taking away human individuality and free will and devaluing ones worth to making him a conforming citizen in a world with diminishing uniqueness is strong and potent. A Clockwork Orange isn't an exploitation film and it isn't a film with violence for violence's sake. The film goes to great lengths to detail psychology and conditioning to the point where it wouldn't be a stretch to name it one of the field's biggest films. The film is also another case where the lead actor and director team up to make an incredible match. Malcolm McDowell gives a tremendous performance here that's troubling, alive, and coldly inspiring. McDowell is only elevated by Stanley Kubrick's typically wide-angle shots and very spacious long shots that show the landscape of the shots and the futuristic design of Kubrick's vision. These talents combined give A Clockwork Orange the strong performance and directorial leverage it needs to communicate its story and message significantly. Finally, it must be said that A Clockwork Orange was going to be a challenge to adapt to the screen no matter assumed what position. The novel is more heavy on the slang than the film, and featured a large glossary in the back of the book defining every word clearly. The film doesn't have that privilege and likely several others that are exclusive to the novel. As all book-to-movie adaptations, the film provides the benefits of a specific (not an absolute, as many confuse) vision of the novel's work and, as a result, may offer the best adaptation one will ever see of the novel. Starring: Malcolm McDowell. Directed by: Stanley Kubrick.

    Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel must rank as one of the most controversial and disturbing mainstream films ever made. Story deals with a young hooligan named Alex(vividly brought to life by Malcolm McDowell) who leads a gang of vicious young British thugs as they mercilessly terrorize various innocent people, when their not fighting with other gangs. Alex breaks up the gang, and is captured by the authorities, who make him the willing subject of an experiment where all the aggressive thoughts are wiped from his mind, leaving him practically helpless later, when he is declared "cured" and sent back into society, where he will then reap what he has sewn... Of course, that's part of the point, that unless you cure society of the very thing you would cure an individual, you will still be left with a problem. Seeing Alex get punished by those he victimized is without doubt satisfying(Charles Bronson would have shot these punks dead without a second thought in his "Death Wish" films!)So Kubrick puts the viewer in the exact position of the avenging victims, which can also be uncomfortable on reflection, but we know exactly what Alex did, though was that part of him really cured? Is it dead? Or can it be revived? The difference between violence being sanctioned or unsanctioned, depending on whether they work for the government or not(as some of the gang will...) Kubrick gives the audience much to consider in this shocking film, not always easy to watch(to say the least) but one that cannot be easily dismissed either, though it was banned for years, but can now be seen on DVD.

    Stanley Kubrick manages to create an incredibly; questionable atmosphere throughout the film. Though it may be intended in the novel to represent a future Britain, the film still uses 70's fashion, style and architect, with much stronger and colourful sexual nature. Malcolm McDowell's delivery of the characteristics of Alex are truly extraordinary. Of course his physical traits allow him to portray Alex, whereas, his psychological traits portray a remarkable; gentlemanly character. As a matter of fact, Alex appears to be delinquent with an isolated soul. The scenes of sexual and violent nature can be perceived as 'Disturbing', though Kubrick has appeared to have used mild black comedy to prevent fear and worry of the audiences own safety. The locations used in A Clockwork Orange all have the 'groovy' colour and style that surprisingly creates a cold unwelcoming atmosphere. Which gives off the feeling that the country has fallen and will not be restored to its safe state. All in all, the film can leave one feeling confused and cold. Though it is a must-see, and well worth your time. An absolute work of art.

    This witty and stylistic film inspired many of the new age filmmakers and actors over the years. Murder, Rape, Violence, Sex, and Mental disease all in one cluster made film. This film made by Stanley Kubrick, adapted from Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel, follows charismatic delinquent that is jailed and volunteers for an experimental aversion therapy developed by the government in an effort to solve society's crime problem, but once his problem is cured if follows the horrid aftermath of things that happen to him once he's "cured". You go from hating and even being envious of this character to hating him some more, but once cured you feel sympathy for the terrible things that happens to him, but know he deserves it.

Of course most audiences ignored its thematic value and focused too much on Kubrick's portrayal of ruthless violence, which  despite his outrageous displays of 'Verfremdung' to make it easier on the soul  are still quite disturbing, ultimately leading to this film receiving X ratings around the globe and being withdrawn from UK circulation at Kubrick's insistence because it was said to inspire several violent incidents involving youths. It wasn't until Kubrick's death the film was finally allowed to be shown in British movie theaters.

    A film like "A Clockwork Orange" is very hard to bare. With subject matter of this film, it's hard not to. But there is something about "A Clockwork Orange" that pushes it to the edge on a psychological level. It's a misanthropic view of humanity's need to be controlled, and the need for freedom, a "balance" that needs to be made. It's a film that definitely will leave audiences in uncomfortable states of mind, but that is exactly what Stanley Kubrick wanted, and it worked perfectly. "A Clockwork Orange" is about a young criminal named Alex DeLarge who has a lust for "ultraviolence," and engages in the dirtiest of the dirtiest of crimes, assault, rape, murder, violent acts are what get Alex off. After being caught, he is placed in an experimental program where they "sensitize" Alex to the concepts of violence and rape, and the crippled mindset and life he is left. It's hard to find where to start with this film, it's, to a person like me, a perfect film. It gets an incredible emotional rise out of the viewers, and it's intellectually stimulating. The story originally written by Anthony Burgess is the back bone of what helped shaped the hopeful beginnings for this film. The story is perfect, especially for a cinematic style like Stanley Kubrick. The story is engaging for the audience, and is intellectually stimulating, questioning the boundaries between human control and human freedom. Stanley Kubrick is an incredible filmmaker. He has visions of pure genius, and knows exactly how to move his audience, and he does it perfectly with "A Clockwork Orange." He shows you the filth of humanity, and he's not afraid to push your feelings to the boundaries. This is the kind of story that HAD to be made by Stanley Kubrick to be as good as it is, a story as intense as "A Clockwork Orange" deserves to be handled by an intense filmmaker. Malcom McDowell's performance of Alex is excellent. He portrays a cold, lifeless, power hungry, psychopathic criminal with a scary charm, a perfect performance for such a twisted character. The cinematography is unbelievable. A great use of color, and great composition in nearly every shot, very common traits of Stanley Kubrick's films. The cinematography in this film reminds me of the photographic work of William Eggleston for some reason. In Kubrick's black and white films he reminds me more of Robert Frank. The music choice is unbelievable. The synthesized version of "Funeral For Queen Mary" was an interesting choice for a theme song for the film, and Beethoven's 9th Symphony is always an excellent listen, but the contrast between Alex's violence and his love of Beethoven is an interesting clash of ideas. Before I make this review too long, I will go ahead and wrap it up. This is a must see film, despite its "extreme intensity" emotionally on its viewers. It's a true cinematic classic, and will be a perfect example, to me at least, of what true art should be.

    **gives away scenes in the movie** This movie is one of my favorites. It really gets you into the mind of a psychopath and what makes him tick. Every scene of this movie shows just how his mind is set and what exactly he is after. He is violent and aggressive. To me the name of the movie really can say a lot about it. ''Clockwork'' meaning mechanical. When Alex is arrested he is then placed in a mental hospital where they basically brainwash him to be good. Well, what this movie really symbolizes is you can't play the role of God. Alex is being forced to be good when it's not in his nature. ''Orange'' actually represents a person. How their bright and can stand out. They're simply trying to take is individuality away. They're just trying to make him mechanical. After all the therapy and brainwashing he endures he realizes that every time he is exposed to violence he gets ill. And at a few other scenes in the movie you notice he gets ill from hearing Beethoven.(something he actually found beauty in) Which at some point drives him crazy and he attempts suicide. As he lays in the hospital and promises to keep what really happened secret it shows how he is no longer brainwashed. This is shown when they play Beethoven in the background and his sudden vision at the end. It also represents that you can never mold someone into what they are not. You can't change someone if they don't want to be changed. And in the words of the writer Anthony Burgess: "What I was trying to say was that it is better to be bad of one's own free will than to be good through scientific brainwashing" he also says "When Alex has the power of choice, he chooses only violence. But, as his love of music shows, there are other areas of choice."

    A Clockwork Orange isn't an atypical classic because nearly everything you can say about it has already been said. Praising it has become a pretty traditional thing to do, and if you dare criticize it, then you must endure not just the cult-fanbase but the Kubrick-fanbase. I wouldn't wish backlash from both of those groups on an enemy. Howeer, I shouldn't be hearing it from either. Stanley Kubrick's controversial classic is a troubling but required watch, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, which is rumored to be inspired from a personal instance. Burgess's wife was brutally assaulted by a group of thugs at one point, and Burgess tried to penetrate the psychology of such unconscionable men who would dare commit such a disgusting, degrading act. If this is true - and Kubrick left Burgess's message from the novel in tact - then the stance he takes here is stunningly humanistic and brave. The film stars a young, energetic Malcolm McDowell as Alex, a young man who commits unsightly atrocities such as rape and assault upon getting innocent people to open their doors thinking they're doing a helpless soul a favor who they believe was in a car-wreck. He commits these crimes with a gang of men he calls his "droogs," and their spree resorts to an ugly but surprisingly professional scene of rape. During this scene, Alex sings a familiar song you will not see in the same light again (similar to how Alex will later react to a specific song, but I'm getting ahead of myself). Alex is eventually arrested and thrown into prison, but he's given an option upon entering the compound. He can be simply jailed or he can be psychologically conditioned - a new process that can help him - to be good and moral. He chooses to be conditioned and undergoes a series of mentally trying tests that take his individuality, regardless of how despicable it is, along with the basic qualities of him being a human with free-will. After the lengthy psychological processes are complete, he's released back into society as a changed man. Though it predated techno-music pioneer Gary Numan's career by a few years, A Clockwork Orange seems like a cinematic adaptation of one of Numan's darkest, eeriest songs. From the stunningly cold voice of Alex, to the futuristic, dystopian environment, to the beautifully polished set-designs, it seems as if this is a Gary Numan song with the benefit of being a one-hundred and thirty-eight minute music video. All I was waiting for in the end was the Machman to show up. Moreover, the content of this film is widely known to be explicit and still somewhat shocking to this date. But make no mistake in saying the film is mean-spirited just to be mean-spirited. The film's commentary on psychological conditioning taking away human individuality and free will and devaluing ones worth to making him a conforming citizen in a world with diminishing uniqueness is strong and potent. A Clockwork Orange isn't an exploitation film and it isn't a film with violence for violence's sake. The film goes to great lengths to detail psychology and conditioning to the point where it wouldn't be a stretch to name it one of the field's biggest films. The film is also another case where the lead actor and director team up to make an incredible match. Malcolm McDowell gives a tremendous performance here that's troubling, alive, and coldly inspiring. McDowell is only elevated by Stanley Kubrick's typically wide-angle shots and very spacious long shots that show the landscape of the shots and the futuristic design of Kubrick's vision. These talents combined give A Clockwork Orange the strong performance and directorial leverage it needs to communicate its story and message significantly. Finally, it must be said that A Clockwork Orange was going to be a challenge to adapt to the screen no matter assumed what position. The novel is more heavy on the slang than the film, and featured a large glossary in the back of the book defining every word clearly. The film doesn't have that privilege and likely several others that are exclusive to the novel. As all book-to-movie adaptations, the film provides the benefits of a specific (not an absolute, as many confuse) vision of the novel's work and, as a result, may offer the best adaptation one will ever see of the novel. Starring: Malcolm McDowell. Directed by: Stanley Kubrick.

    Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel must rank as one of the most controversial and disturbing mainstream films ever made. Story deals with a young hooligan named Alex(vividly brought to life by Malcolm McDowell) who leads a gang of vicious young British thugs as they mercilessly terrorize various innocent people, when their not fighting with other gangs. Alex breaks up the gang, and is captured by the authorities, who make him the willing subject of an experiment where all the aggressive thoughts are wiped from his mind, leaving him practically helpless later, when he is declared "cured" and sent back into society, where he will then reap what he has sewn... Of course, that's part of the point, that unless you cure society of the very thing you would cure an individual, you will still be left with a problem. Seeing Alex get punished by those he victimized is without doubt satisfying(Charles Bronson would have shot these punks dead without a second thought in his "Death Wish" films!)So Kubrick puts the viewer in the exact position of the avenging victims, which can also be uncomfortable on reflection, but we know exactly what Alex did, though was that part of him really cured? Is it dead? Or can it be revived? The difference between violence being sanctioned or unsanctioned, depending on whether they work for the government or not(as some of the gang will...) Kubrick gives the audience much to consider in this shocking film, not always easy to watch(to say the least) but one that cannot be easily dismissed either, though it was banned for years, but can now be seen on DVD.

    Stanley Kubrick manages to create an incredibly; questionable atmosphere throughout the film. Though it may be intended in the novel to represent a future Britain, the film still uses 70's fashion, style and architect, with much stronger and colourful sexual nature. Malcolm McDowell's delivery of the characteristics of Alex are truly extraordinary. Of course his physical traits allow him to portray Alex, whereas, his psychological traits portray a remarkable; gentlemanly character. As a matter of fact, Alex appears to be delinquent with an isolated soul. The scenes of sexual and violent nature can be perceived as 'Disturbing', though Kubrick has appeared to have used mild black comedy to prevent fear and worry of the audiences own safety. The locations used in A Clockwork Orange all have the 'groovy' colour and style that surprisingly creates a cold unwelcoming atmosphere. Which gives off the feeling that the country has fallen and will not be restored to its safe state. All in all, the film can leave one feeling confused and cold. Though it is a must-see, and well worth your time. An absolute work of art.

    This witty and stylistic film inspired many of the new age filmmakers and actors over the years. Murder, Rape, Violence, Sex, and Mental disease all in one cluster made film. This film made by Stanley Kubrick, adapted from Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel, follows charismatic delinquent that is jailed and volunteers for an experimental aversion therapy developed by the government in an effort to solve society's crime problem, but once his problem is cured if follows the horrid aftermath of things that happen to him once he's "cured". You go from hating and even being envious of this character to hating him some more, but once cured you feel sympathy for the terrible things that happens to him, but know he deserves it.

    Stanley Kubrick always knew how to use music in his films and "A Clockwork Orange" is no exception--Most of the music was written by Walter Carlos (of 'Switched On Bach' album fame) who later changed his sex and became Wendy Carlos..What's so fantastic is the way the music draws you in and never lets go throughout the film (especially in the scenes where Alex is forced to sit in a 'dentist' type chair, get eye drops put in, and forced to watch past history experiences of "Ultra Violence" which include some disturbing scenes of Hitler's rise to power during WWII)...If there was a separate rating for this film's musical score, I'd give it 10/10 stars!

    On any list of controversial films released, it's nearly guaranteed to find Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange somewhere on the list, most likely near the top. Kubrick's classic adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel of the same name is often regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time, but also as one of the most controversial. Brutal violence and sexuality feature prominently within A Clockwork Orange, which caused the film to be withdrawn from British cinemas until Kubrick's death in 1999. Regardless of the extreme violence and sexuality, A Clockwork Orange is one of Kubrick's finest hours and is one of cinema's greatest outings. Following the Burgess novel, A Clockwork Orange is set in a dystopian London in the near future. In this dystopia, Alex DeLarge and his group of "droogs" frequently roam the city and commit acts of "ultra-violence" after stopping by the Korova milk bar to drink intoxicated "milk plus." Just a young teenager, Alex's favorite pastimes include brutality of innocent citizens, rape and sexuality, and classical music, most notably Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex has no sympathy for any of his victims as he commits new crimes each and every night. During one of his midnight assaults, Alex is taken into custody by the police. Sentenced to fourteen years in prison, Alex finds a way to escape back into society though the experimental Ludovico Treatment. A kind of aversion therapy, the Ludovico Treatment is successful as Alex becomes the clockwork orange of society. However, the changes brought on by the government will leave lasting changes on Alex and the new society he enters, with some interesting results. Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel is fantastic, and is one of Kubrick's more faithful adaptations. The writing executes the extremely engrossing story very well, keeping you immersed and fascinated by the characters and events going on. The film makes smooth transitions from the different acts, each of which is nothing like the other. Dialogue between characters is very well written, often with some of Kubrick's dark humor. The use of nadsat, a fictional language used by Alex and his droogs, is used frequently, but works very well without becoming overwhelming. The most important aspect of A Clockwork Orange's writing is the themes of the story itself. Ultimately, the film asks whether it is right to take away one's freedom for the good of everyone else. The stand out of A Clockwork Orange is the amazing performance from Malcolm McDowell as Alex. As sadistic and twisted the character is, you can't help but feel sympathetic for him when he's freedom is forced away from him at the hands of others, and McDowell is certainly a driving force in this characteristic. Every line McDowell delivers is memorable and amazing. McDowell completely embodies the character of Alex, something most actors can never do in their roles. In fact, there's not a single actor that would have been a better fit for Alex than McDowell. It's no wonder the character of Alex is so beloved among the cult following A Clockwork Orange has. Another superb element of A Clockwork Orange is the choice of music. Like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film doesn't create an entirely original score, but rather uses classic pieces of music mixed in with synthesized pieces by composer Walter Carlos (later known as Wendy Carlos). Every song is perfectly edited in with the wonderful Kubrick visuals to create a perfect combination. Henry Purcell's Funeral of Queen Mary serves as the perfect introduction for the movie in every way. A sped up version of the William Tell Overture is used during a fast motion sex scene, and Beethoven's symphonies are used prominently. Easily the most recognizable, and infamous, piece in the movie is Singin in the Rain, which is used in a disturbingly effective way during a rape scene. Everything about A Clockwork Orange embodies Kubrick's perfectionism and greatness. Kubrick would go on and make movies until his untimely death, but A Clockwork Orange stands as Kubrick's finest work. The story is told with both fantastic writing and the visual style we've come to expect from Stanley Kubrick. Top it off with a Golden Globe nominated (and Oscar worthy) performance by Malcolm McDowell and perfectly chosen music tracks and you've got a classic piece of film history. There are simply no words to describe A Clockwork Orange's greatness.

    I have heard a lot about this movie before i've decided to rent it a few days earlier. I heard about how violent it is and how controversy it caused on it's initial release and its ban (I learned about in my mass media class about violence in the media)even spawning a syndrome in which gangs of young men impersonate the main characters taking journeys of rape and the so-called "ultra-violence". After finally renting it and watching it i finally saw what this film really is: Extremely violent, disturbing and sick but ultimately a genius masterpiece and one of the finest works of cinema ever made. In futuristic Britain, young Alex and his gang enjoy going out at nights and hitting raping and cursing everything in their way, but when Alex is caught by the police for murdering (by accident) one of his victims he is sentenced to 14 years of prison, but when ALex hears about a new method that might help him get out of jail quick, which is an experiment that will eventually make him feel sick every time he gets into a situation that might trigger his violent and sexual desires. Alex agrees but while this method helps get out of jail and diminish his violent desires, it also takes away his humanity from him and his ability to make his own choices which leads society to take advantage of him and unleash its violence on him and Begin went through the experiment, he is left helpless against it. Everything about this film, from the script to the direction to the performances to the soundtrack (relying heavily on Beethoven's 9th symphony), and of course the violent and sexual footage that might disturb to a level that some will find too much, all add up to this films ultimate message: How much can the authorities take over the individual's ability to make his/her own decisions and strip him away from humanity no matter who he or she is. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece lives on and will continue to earn new fans every year, if u haven't seen this film before and have the ability to watch it, do yourself a favor and watch it, fro it is one of the greatest, most thought-provoking films ever made

    Nightmarish, highly stylized and plain bizarre, this remains one of the most controversial motion pictures of all time. Kubrick adapts Anthony Burgess' original novel with more visual flair than we're used to even from him, painting a ghoulish, depraved world in the not so distant future (at least, in 1971) where youth violence has run rampant. Malcolm McDowell, not one to turn down a shocking movie (like Caligula at the end of the decade), stars as the completely messed up sociopath gang leader Alex DeLarge whose various hobbies include hanging out at the local bar and taking illicit substances, classical music, raping women and just beating people for the fun of it. One night, he goes a little too far, which ends up in a trip to jail, where he volunteers for a scientific project designed to make offenders reject violence. After undergoing the experiments he is released and finds himself back on the streets, having to cope with the aftereffects of his actions when running into his old acquaintances, with not so nice results for his health, physically and mentally. The grotesque and haunting visual imagery aside, the film deals with the philosophical matter of freedom of will, as Alex is robbed of his in society's effort to keep kids like him in line, with dire consequences for the now peaceful subjects: are they really 'them' afterwards, being robbed of their choice to be violent or not? Of course most audiences ignored its thematic value and focused too much on Kubrick's portrayal of ruthless violence, which  despite his outrageous displays of 'Verfremdung' to make it easier on the soul  are still quite disturbing, ultimately leading to this film receiving X ratings around the globe and being withdrawn from UK circulation at Kubrick's insistence because it was said to inspire several violent incidents involving youths. It wasn't until Kubrick's death the film was finally allowed to be shown in British movie theaters.

A Clockwork Orange isn't an exploitation film and it isn't a film with violence for violence's sake. The film goes to great lengths to detail psychology and conditioning to the point where it wouldn't be a stretch to name it one of the field's biggest films. The film is also another case where the lead actor and director team up to make an incredible match. Malcolm McDowell gives a tremendous performance here that's troubling, alive, and coldly inspiring. McDowell is only elevated by Stanley Kubrick's typically wide-angle shots and very spacious long shots that show the landscape of the shots and the futuristic design of Kubrick's vision. These talents combined give A Clockwork Orange the strong performance and directorial leverage it needs to communicate its story and message significantly. Finally, it must be said that A Clockwork Orange was going to be a challenge to adapt to the screen no matter assumed what position. The novel is more heavy on the slang than the film, and featured a large glossary in the back of the book defining every word clearly. The film doesn't have that privilege and likely several others that are exclusive to the novel. As all book-to-movie adaptations, the film provides the benefits of a specific (not an absolute, as many confuse) vision of the novel's work and, as a result, may offer the best adaptation one will ever see of the novel. Starring: Malcolm McDowell. Directed by: Stanley Kubrick.

    Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel must rank as one of the most controversial and disturbing mainstream films ever made. Story deals with a young hooligan named Alex(vividly brought to life by Malcolm McDowell) who leads a gang of vicious young British thugs as they mercilessly terrorize various innocent people, when their not fighting with other gangs. Alex breaks up the gang, and is captured by the authorities, who make him the willing subject of an experiment where all the aggressive thoughts are wiped from his mind, leaving him practically helpless later, when he is declared "cured" and sent back into society, where he will then reap what he has sewn... Of course, that's part of the point, that unless you cure society of the very thing you would cure an individual, you will still be left with a problem. Seeing Alex get punished by those he victimized is without doubt satisfying(Charles Bronson would have shot these punks dead without a second thought in his "Death Wish" films!)So Kubrick puts the viewer in the exact position of the avenging victims, which can also be uncomfortable on reflection, but we know exactly what Alex did, though was that part of him really cured? Is it dead? Or can it be revived? The difference between violence being sanctioned or unsanctioned, depending on whether they work for the government or not(as some of the gang will...) Kubrick gives the audience much to consider in this shocking film, not always easy to watch(to say the least) but one that cannot be easily dismissed either, though it was banned for years, but can now be seen on DVD.

    Stanley Kubrick manages to create an incredibly; questionable atmosphere throughout the film. Though it may be intended in the novel to represent a future Britain, the film still uses 70's fashion, style and architect, with much stronger and colourful sexual nature. Malcolm McDowell's delivery of the characteristics of Alex are truly extraordinary. Of course his physical traits allow him to portray Alex, whereas, his psychological traits portray a remarkable; gentlemanly character. As a matter of fact, Alex appears to be delinquent with an isolated soul. The scenes of sexual and violent nature can be perceived as 'Disturbing', though Kubrick has appeared to have used mild black comedy to prevent fear and worry of the audiences own safety. The locations used in A Clockwork Orange all have the 'groovy' colour and style that surprisingly creates a cold unwelcoming atmosphere. Which gives off the feeling that the country has fallen and will not be restored to its safe state. All in all, the film can leave one feeling confused and cold. Though it is a must-see, and well worth your time. An absolute work of art.

    This witty and stylistic film inspired many of the new age filmmakers and actors over the years. Murder, Rape, Violence, Sex, and Mental disease all in one cluster made film. This film made by Stanley Kubrick, adapted from Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel, follows charismatic delinquent that is jailed and volunteers for an experimental aversion therapy developed by the government in an effort to solve society's crime problem, but once his problem is cured if follows the horrid aftermath of things that happen to him once he's "cured". You go from hating and even being envious of this character to hating him some more, but once cured you feel sympathy for the terrible things that happens to him, but know he deserves it.

    Stanley Kubrick always knew how to use music in his films and "A Clockwork Orange" is no exception--Most of the music was written by Walter Carlos (of 'Switched On Bach' album fame) who later changed his sex and became Wendy Carlos..What's so fantastic is the way the music draws you in and never lets go throughout the film (especially in the scenes where Alex is forced to sit in a 'dentist' type chair, get eye drops put in, and forced to watch past history experiences of "Ultra Violence" which include some disturbing scenes of Hitler's rise to power during WWII)...If there was a separate rating for this film's musical score, I'd give it 10/10 stars!

    On any list of controversial films released, it's nearly guaranteed to find Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange somewhere on the list, most likely near the top. Kubrick's classic adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel of the same name is often regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time, but also as one of the most controversial. Brutal violence and sexuality feature prominently within A Clockwork Orange, which caused the film to be withdrawn from British cinemas until Kubrick's death in 1999. Regardless of the extreme violence and sexuality, A Clockwork Orange is one of Kubrick's finest hours and is one of cinema's greatest outings. Following the Burgess novel, A Clockwork Orange is set in a dystopian London in the near future. In this dystopia, Alex DeLarge and his group of "droogs" frequently roam the city and commit acts of "ultra-violence" after stopping by the Korova milk bar to drink intoxicated "milk plus." Just a young teenager, Alex's favorite pastimes include brutality of innocent citizens, rape and sexuality, and classical music, most notably Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex has no sympathy for any of his victims as he commits new crimes each and every night. During one of his midnight assaults, Alex is taken into custody by the police. Sentenced to fourteen years in prison, Alex finds a way to escape back into society though the experimental Ludovico Treatment. A kind of aversion therapy, the Ludovico Treatment is successful as Alex becomes the clockwork orange of society. However, the changes brought on by the government will leave lasting changes on Alex and the new society he enters, with some interesting results. Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel is fantastic, and is one of Kubrick's more faithful adaptations. The writing executes the extremely engrossing story very well, keeping you immersed and fascinated by the characters and events going on. The film makes smooth transitions from the different acts, each of which is nothing like the other. Dialogue between characters is very well written, often with some of Kubrick's dark humor. The use of nadsat, a fictional language used by Alex and his droogs, is used frequently, but works very well without becoming overwhelming. The most important aspect of A Clockwork Orange's writing is the themes of the story itself. Ultimately, the film asks whether it is right to take away one's freedom for the good of everyone else. The stand out of A Clockwork Orange is the amazing performance from Malcolm McDowell as Alex. As sadistic and twisted the character is, you can't help but feel sympathetic for him when he's freedom is forced away from him at the hands of others, and McDowell is certainly a driving force in this characteristic. Every line McDowell delivers is memorable and amazing. McDowell completely embodies the character of Alex, something most actors can never do in their roles. In fact, there's not a single actor that would have been a better fit for Alex than McDowell. It's no wonder the character of Alex is so beloved among the cult following A Clockwork Orange has. Another superb element of A Clockwork Orange is the choice of music. Like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film doesn't create an entirely original score, but rather uses classic pieces of music mixed in with synthesized pieces by composer Walter Carlos (later known as Wendy Carlos). Every song is perfectly edited in with the wonderful Kubrick visuals to create a perfect combination. Henry Purcell's Funeral of Queen Mary serves as the perfect introduction for the movie in every way. A sped up version of the William Tell Overture is used during a fast motion sex scene, and Beethoven's symphonies are used prominently. Easily the most recognizable, and infamous, piece in the movie is Singin in the Rain, which is used in a disturbingly effective way during a rape scene. Everything about A Clockwork Orange embodies Kubrick's perfectionism and greatness. Kubrick would go on and make movies until his untimely death, but A Clockwork Orange stands as Kubrick's finest work. The story is told with both fantastic writing and the visual style we've come to expect from Stanley Kubrick. Top it off with a Golden Globe nominated (and Oscar worthy) performance by Malcolm McDowell and perfectly chosen music tracks and you've got a classic piece of film history. There are simply no words to describe A Clockwork Orange's greatness.
