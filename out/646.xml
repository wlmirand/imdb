 <sinopse>
  Epic story of a mysterious stranger with a harmonica who joins forces with a notorious desperado to protect a beautiful widow from a ruthless assassin working for the railroad.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Story of a young woman, Mrs. McBain, who moves from New Orleans to frontier Utah, on the very edge of the American West. She arrives to find her new husband and family slaughtered, but by who? The prime suspect, coffee-lover Cheyenne, befriends her and offers to go after the real killer, assassin gang leader Frank, in her honor. He is accompanied by Harmonica on his quest to get even. Get-rich-quick subplots and intricate character histories intertwine with such artistic flair that this could in fact be the movie-to-end-all-movies.

    Sergio Leone's follow up to his superlative "Man With No Name" trilogy is highly acclaimed in some circles, a bit too much so to be honest, but is still a well acted story of a woman(beautiful Claudia Cardinale) who comes to the west as a mail-order-bride, only to find that her would-be family was wiped out by a cold-hearted gunfighter(Henry Fonda, cast effectively against type). She nonetheless vows to carry on, and is later helped by a man known as Harmonica(Charles Bronson) who has also vowed to kill the same man that killed her family. Sprawling story details the westward expansion by train that transformed America irrevocably, ending many ways of life. I did like this film, it is stylish and ambitious, with a good score, but it does become tedious at times, not to mention uncomfortable(Fonda's scenes with Cardinale, for instance...) I just didn't like it anywhere near as much as "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly", but film is still memorable, just not a "classic".

    Once Upon A Time In The West is a quite simply a masterpiece. No film has ever had the same effect on me. I shan't repeat the many eloquent reviews on here which wax lyrically about Leone's beautiful direction, Morricone's sublime score, and the four perfect lead performances.....there would be no point as i agree wholeheartedly. I will instead just list some of the many small moments in this incredible film, moments which make the experience of viewing Leone's epic even greater than the sum of those aforementioned parts: The expression on Henry Fonda's face as he confronts little Timmy McBain, and the sneer in his voice as he tells Morton "People scare better when they're dying!"....has there ever been a more coldblooded villain in movie history? Claudia Cardinale's brown eyes. Charles Bronson and Jason Robards' putdowns. "You know music- and you can count. All the way up to two!" "Do you know a man with a harmonica? He's someone you'd remember. Instead of talking he plays- and when he'd better play, he talks." THAT opening sequence.... THAT shot as Jill arrives at the station, the camera swooping up and over the building to reveal the entire town. And finally, a heartfelt conversation between the film's two most pitiless characters,and bitterest enemies, before their final showdown about how there's no place for their kind anymore in the new civilized America. Leone's previous 3 westerns, particularly his celebrated The Good The Bad & The Ugly, were remarkable movies in their own right. It's a measure of what a triumph Once Upon A Time In The West is that it easily tops them all, along with every other western- yes, even Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch.

    With "Once upon a time in the West" Sergio Leone made an another masterpiece. "Once upon a time in the West" is a movie which has action and is a classic western, it has gunfires and all of that. It's one of the best western movies of all time. This movie has to do with an assassin who wants to kill a widow and from the other hand we have a mysterious and strange man who protects this beautiful widow from the assassin. Claudia Cardinale (Jill McBain - the beautiful widow) makes a great interpretation and she is a pleasant presence who beautifies the movie. Henry Fonda (Frank) and Charles Bronson (Harmonica) made an also good interpretations.

    For me, no other movie has captured the Wild West like Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West. When a mysterious stranger with a harmonica protects a beautiful but naive widow from a ruthless train baron and his hired gun, they all soon discover that much more than prized land is at stake.This is more than a movie, it's an experience in my mind, a piece of history, as the west is portrayed as a haunting brutal land that discriminates against absolutely no-one. From the eerie silent opening to the unimaginable and unforgettable ending, Leone takes you down a path that hasn't been explored in a western before or since. 10 outta 10 guaranteed!!!

    Epic story of a mysterious stranger with a harmonica who joins forces with a notorious desperado to protect a beautiful widow from a ruthless assassin working for the railroad. From Sergio Leone comes another classic Spaghetti Western, that movie is his 1968 masterwork, Once Upon A Time In The West. Once Upon A Time In The West is a classic movie, it is one of Leone's finest works, an it is just as great as, if not better, than "The Man With No Name" Trilogy. This movie is beautifully shot, it's powerfully written, it's powerfully acted, and it's superbly directed. Leone was a genius, he was the master of Spaghetti Westerns, he previously had achieved greatness with his classic trilogy featuring "The Man With No Name," and here, he achieve more greatness, and then he would achieve more greatness with his final movie, his 1984 gangster epic, Once Upon A Time In America. But this movie is wonderful, it's a classic that is one of the best of the Western genre, as well as the Spaghetti Western genre, in short, this movie is pretty perfect. As with many of Leone's other works, Once Upon A Time In The West has a stellar line-up in the casting. Charles Bronson leads the cast as Harmonica, a mysterious harmonica-playing stranger who joins forces with a man named Cheyenne to take out a ruthless assassin. Bronson was known for tough guy roles, and here, he is superb, this is probably his best performance. The always wonderful Jason Robards plays Cheyenne, a bandit who is framed for some murders that he did not commit. Claudia Cardinale is not wasted as Jill McBain, a woman whose family has been murdered and is going along with Cheyenne and Robards to find the killer. Lastly, Henry Fonda is chilling as Frank, one of the greatest movie villains of all time. Fonda was usually known for playing the hero, but here, he played the villain, and he was outstanding in doing so. Along with the acting, we have got a very fine music score from Ennio Morricone, who worked with Leone on many of his films. Many people consider Once Upon A Time In The West to be Leone's finest work. I agree with that, as this movie is outstanding, and it is just as great as, if not better than, "The Man With No Name" trilogy. The movie is nearly three hours long, but it does not seem that long as the film moves quickly with powerful storytelling and wonderful performances. I agree with the critics, Once Upon A Time In The West is a masterpiece of cinema, it defines the meaning of the words, great movies, and it redefines the Western genre as a whole. I send my posthumous applauds to all of those involved, especially to Charles Bronson and Jason Robards. Henry Fonda gets the most applauds, as he was in a class by himself. How he could portray so perfectly a coldblooded killer with absolutely no redeeming features is beyond my imagination. And something else, when he made the movie, Henry Fonda was 63, but he certainly did not appear 63, he appeared much younger. Anyway, Once Upon A Time In The West is better than the hype surrounding it, do not miss the masterpiece. 10/10

    I just got around to viewing this last week on Netflix... Since last weekend I have watched it a further three times and will readily concur with many others on this board that this is my favourite film of all time... It has to be; I've wracked my cranium for the last few days trying to think of another that moved me so profoundly, and nothing comes to mind... The ten minute (or so) gun battle/flashback sequence with Frank and Harmonica had me both crying and goosebump-ridden, Morricone's soaring, amplified guitar playing throughout that sequence left me in such a state of exhilaration that I can't quite express it properly... I found myself having to pull it together to watch the last brilliant 15 or so minutes... Others have described the pace of this film as being "slow"; to those who haven't seen this film, doing confuse this with boring! Like a great book I was sad to see it end, and have returned to it repeatedly over the past few days, appreciating it more every time...

    I personally don't watch a lot of westerns. But if I did, I'm sure this would be one of the top ones. It is slow and intense, the story is thrilling, and you capture the whole feeling of the old American ways. Think younger generations, can't appreciate the movie on a higher level, like the people that were alive when it came out. I'm sure this was what people wanted back then, and the movie delivered. Just like there is a "superhero" era right now, westerns were just as hyped in their own day. This is actually a decent movie, even if you are not fan of the genre. 8 out of 10

    Once Upon A Time In The West is one of the greatest Westerns ever made and a unforgettable,Epic Masterpiece from beginning to end. Filled with powerful direction,great acting,beautiful photography and a brilliant score,Once Upon A Time In The West is not only one of the greatest Westerns of all time,but also one of the greatest films ever made,one of my all-time favorite films and Sergio Leone at his best. Once Upon A Time In The West tells the story of a mysterious stranger named Harmonica(Charles Bronson)who teams up with outlaw Cheyanne(Jason Robards)to protect widow Jill McBain,a former hooker now wife and widow(Claudia Cardinale)from ruthless killer Frank(Henry Fonda)who wants Jill's railroad. Now,Harmonica and Cheyanne must defend and fight for Jill and stop Frank at all costs. Once Upon A Time In The West is a Classic Masterpiece of Cinema that right from the very start has you glued to the screen and give viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that is a large epic not only in scope but in length. Director Sergio Leone gives viewers a different Western than his excellent and Masterful Dollars/Man With No Name Trilogy especially with The Good,The Bad,And The Ugly. I guess that is one of the reasons Once Upon A Time In The West was overlooked when it came out in 1969 because it was a different film than The Man With No Name Trilogy in other words if the Man With No Name Trilogy were Action packed Westerns with big ambitions than Once Upon A Time In The West is a visual Art film Western. Leone takes the epic scope of TG,TB&TU and expands on it with this film giving us a powerful film that has more visuals than dialog and more drama than Action and also pays tribute to the great Western genre taking the trademarks and familiar things that are in a Western film and turning the trademarks on their head and raises the trademarks to a higher level. One of the great things about OUTITW is that this film is more about visuals and tone than it is about dialog because with this film we are shown and given images that are not just there just to be there but add to the story and makes understand what's going on in with the story and the characters who they are and what their motivations are. The images are haunting and at the same time beautiful and add to the films power and greatness. OUATTW doesn't have a lot of dialog but when the dialog is said it is great and memorable making the characters feel gritty and real. It's interesting that OUATTW and Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyseey came out in the same year and while both films are in different genres(Western and Science Fiction)both films are alike in terms of using visuals and little dialog. Leone and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli give OUATTW a beautiful visual style making the West look romantic and epic while at the same time making the film gritty and true to how the old West really was. The style is Spagetti Western but is filmed like a Hollywood Western of the 1940s and 50s All though the film is long(2 Hrs and 45 Minutes)OUATTW moves at a great pace and there is not a wasted scene in the film because OUATTW is one of those films that is so excellent that you want the film to be longer and keep going. The four main characters Jill,Frank,Harmonica and Cheyanne are great characters who represent the classic Western movie standards and arch types(hooker,killer,mysterious gunfighter-gunslinger,outlaw)but the four of them are presented in a larger than life way and are stylized but at the same time feel very real. With the exception of Frank the other main characters Jill,Harmonica and Cheyanne are given a moral ambiguity and have gray areas where you feel sympathy for the three of them and wonder what will happen with the three of them. Although this is not an Action film there are enough Western gunfights to satisfy Western and Action viewers and when the Action happens it is fast and intense. The final 15-20 minutes builds into one of the best endings in film history because it is filled with tension,suspense,surprises and at the same time sad and optimistic. It's an excellent and unforgettable ending you will not forget. The whole cast is great in their roles. Claudia Cardinale is excellent and beautiful as Jill McBain,with Cardinale holding her own against Bronson,Fonda and Robards. Henry Fonda is brilliant and intense as Frank,one of the greatest villains in film history. Fonda is cold and pure evil and you'll never forget his performance. Charles Bronson is wonderful and mysterious as Harmonica,a quiet gunslinger who plays the Harmonica and has great scenes with Cardinale,Fonda and Robards. Jason Robards is great and humorous as Cheyanne,an outlaw that helps out Harmonica and Jill. Gabriele Ferzetti is amazing as Morton,the railroad baron who is also Frank's boss. Frank Wolf(Brett McBain),Lionel Stander(Barman),Paolo Stoppa(Sam)and Keenen Wynn(Sheriif-Auctioneer)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Western favorites like Woody Strode(Stony-Member of Frank's gang)and Jack Elam(Snaky-Member of Frank's gang). The direction by Sergio Leone is excellent,masterful and powerful,with Leone always moving the camera,using great angles and intense close-ups bringing a unique visual style to the film. Great direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is brilliant,beautiful,unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history,with Morricone's score matching the tone and powerful of each scene. A masterful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Westerns or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In The West,a true Masterpiece of the Western genre and a Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    In an age of quick cuts, shaky Camera and CGI, this Film will likely be a hard watch for the post ADD Generation. It is SLOW. The Cinematography lingers. The lines of Dialog are at the most minimum. It is LONG. So why is this considered one of the best Westerns ever. Because it is. An achievement that is a testament to the insatiable Love of Cinema, as Art, that the Europeans unabashedly utilize, like the Hug. They are not shy about physical displays of such Affection. That is the essence of this Film. Leone is a Lover and a Hugger. He is constantly hugging this Movie Loving every minute of it. He Loves the Genre, He Loves the Camera, He loves the Actors Faces, He loves the Landscape, he loves the Mythology, He just Loves and Loves. All that is apparent on the screen. Most likely that is why it is so lengthy. He Loved it all. What emerges is an Authentic Fantasy. There is on display a gorgeousity of grandeur that is quite a sight. Behold its panorama and its larger than Life Characters with their own quirky Personas and accompanying Musical Riffs. This is so playful and fun. It is all done for the Lovers of the World. Mostly, the Lovers of Movies.

    One thing I love about Sergio Leone's style as a director is his execution of telling a story in that while there are moments that have a purpose in progressing in the story, we can appreciate the moments where not much is happening, allowing more room for reflecting, whether it is beauty of the atmosphere in the world these characters live in or how the music is given a chance to evoke the emotions and be its own character. To sum up with more clarity, Sergio Leone made me learn to appreciate films that chooses to take its time, where all the little subtleties are the ones that add the most richness to a film's quality. It made me realize that there doesn't have to be things happening every minute in a movie to truly enjoy it. If I were to describe this stylistic aspect of Leone's directing, I would say he is able to inject a feeling of richness in his stories that makes his films feel very warm in tone, all the while being stories with a lot of grit and sharp edges. With 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' this was the first time this specific quality became evident to me in movies. From all the vast landscapes filmed for specific scenes, we feel more like we are delving into a world of beauty that is rarely visited, than watching a mere movie. How Sergio Leone is able to make his films feel larger than life is an astounding achievement and inspiration for those with an artistic vision. And every acting performance is delivered with a sense of sophistication and grace in adding to this rich story. And with every performance, we are presented with characters that are memorable and pivotal to the world they exist in. The world that exists in the film is filled with dirt and grit, and how these characters behave are evident of the world they live in. And this world that we see is the death of the west and the ushering in of a new era. These characters all play a pivotal point in that, but what plays out in the end is a revelation that brings out the full picture of what lurks underneath the motives that fuels each event that occurs, to bring everything full circle. And the way the movie ends on this note is moving. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a dark western filled with a lot of melancholy, but still possessing a quality of rich beauty. Underneath all the scenes of violence, there is an emotionally undercurrent that manages to seep through and how Sergio Leone is able to convey those emotions with so much subtlety shows the true mark of a great director. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a classic not only due to its ambition, but also in how grand it feels in every sense of the word.

    I just got around to viewing this last week on Netflix... Since last weekend I have watched it a further three times and will readily concur with many others on this board that this is my favourite film of all time... It has to be; I've wracked my cranium for the last few days trying to think of another that moved me so profoundly, and nothing comes to mind... The ten minute (or so) gun battle/flashback sequence with Frank and Harmonica had me both crying and goosebump-ridden, Morricone's soaring, amplified guitar playing throughout that sequence left me in such a state of exhilaration that I can't quite express it properly... I found myself having to pull it together to watch the last brilliant 15 or so minutes... Others have described the pace of this film as being "slow"; to those who haven't seen this film, doing confuse this with boring! Like a great book I was sad to see it end, and have returned to it repeatedly over the past few days, appreciating it more every time...

    I personally don't watch a lot of westerns. But if I did, I'm sure this would be one of the top ones. It is slow and intense, the story is thrilling, and you capture the whole feeling of the old American ways. Think younger generations, can't appreciate the movie on a higher level, like the people that were alive when it came out. I'm sure this was what people wanted back then, and the movie delivered. Just like there is a "superhero" era right now, westerns were just as hyped in their own day. This is actually a decent movie, even if you are not fan of the genre. 8 out of 10

    Once Upon A Time In The West is one of the greatest Westerns ever made and a unforgettable,Epic Masterpiece from beginning to end. Filled with powerful direction,great acting,beautiful photography and a brilliant score,Once Upon A Time In The West is not only one of the greatest Westerns of all time,but also one of the greatest films ever made,one of my all-time favorite films and Sergio Leone at his best. Once Upon A Time In The West tells the story of a mysterious stranger named Harmonica(Charles Bronson)who teams up with outlaw Cheyanne(Jason Robards)to protect widow Jill McBain,a former hooker now wife and widow(Claudia Cardinale)from ruthless killer Frank(Henry Fonda)who wants Jill's railroad. Now,Harmonica and Cheyanne must defend and fight for Jill and stop Frank at all costs. Once Upon A Time In The West is a Classic Masterpiece of Cinema that right from the very start has you glued to the screen and give viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that is a large epic not only in scope but in length. Director Sergio Leone gives viewers a different Western than his excellent and Masterful Dollars/Man With No Name Trilogy especially with The Good,The Bad,And The Ugly. I guess that is one of the reasons Once Upon A Time In The West was overlooked when it came out in 1969 because it was a different film than The Man With No Name Trilogy in other words if the Man With No Name Trilogy were Action packed Westerns with big ambitions than Once Upon A Time In The West is a visual Art film Western. Leone takes the epic scope of TG,TB&TU and expands on it with this film giving us a powerful film that has more visuals than dialog and more drama than Action and also pays tribute to the great Western genre taking the trademarks and familiar things that are in a Western film and turning the trademarks on their head and raises the trademarks to a higher level. One of the great things about OUTITW is that this film is more about visuals and tone than it is about dialog because with this film we are shown and given images that are not just there just to be there but add to the story and makes understand what's going on in with the story and the characters who they are and what their motivations are. The images are haunting and at the same time beautiful and add to the films power and greatness. OUATTW doesn't have a lot of dialog but when the dialog is said it is great and memorable making the characters feel gritty and real. It's interesting that OUATTW and Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyseey came out in the same year and while both films are in different genres(Western and Science Fiction)both films are alike in terms of using visuals and little dialog. Leone and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli give OUATTW a beautiful visual style making the West look romantic and epic while at the same time making the film gritty and true to how the old West really was. The style is Spagetti Western but is filmed like a Hollywood Western of the 1940s and 50s All though the film is long(2 Hrs and 45 Minutes)OUATTW moves at a great pace and there is not a wasted scene in the film because OUATTW is one of those films that is so excellent that you want the film to be longer and keep going. The four main characters Jill,Frank,Harmonica and Cheyanne are great characters who represent the classic Western movie standards and arch types(hooker,killer,mysterious gunfighter-gunslinger,outlaw)but the four of them are presented in a larger than life way and are stylized but at the same time feel very real. With the exception of Frank the other main characters Jill,Harmonica and Cheyanne are given a moral ambiguity and have gray areas where you feel sympathy for the three of them and wonder what will happen with the three of them. Although this is not an Action film there are enough Western gunfights to satisfy Western and Action viewers and when the Action happens it is fast and intense. The final 15-20 minutes builds into one of the best endings in film history because it is filled with tension,suspense,surprises and at the same time sad and optimistic. It's an excellent and unforgettable ending you will not forget. The whole cast is great in their roles. Claudia Cardinale is excellent and beautiful as Jill McBain,with Cardinale holding her own against Bronson,Fonda and Robards. Henry Fonda is brilliant and intense as Frank,one of the greatest villains in film history. Fonda is cold and pure evil and you'll never forget his performance. Charles Bronson is wonderful and mysterious as Harmonica,a quiet gunslinger who plays the Harmonica and has great scenes with Cardinale,Fonda and Robards. Jason Robards is great and humorous as Cheyanne,an outlaw that helps out Harmonica and Jill. Gabriele Ferzetti is amazing as Morton,the railroad baron who is also Frank's boss. Frank Wolf(Brett McBain),Lionel Stander(Barman),Paolo Stoppa(Sam)and Keenen Wynn(Sheriif-Auctioneer)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Western favorites like Woody Strode(Stony-Member of Frank's gang)and Jack Elam(Snaky-Member of Frank's gang). The direction by Sergio Leone is excellent,masterful and powerful,with Leone always moving the camera,using great angles and intense close-ups bringing a unique visual style to the film. Great direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is brilliant,beautiful,unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history,with Morricone's score matching the tone and powerful of each scene. A masterful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Westerns or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In The West,a true Masterpiece of the Western genre and a Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    In an age of quick cuts, shaky Camera and CGI, this Film will likely be a hard watch for the post ADD Generation. It is SLOW. The Cinematography lingers. The lines of Dialog are at the most minimum. It is LONG. So why is this considered one of the best Westerns ever. Because it is. An achievement that is a testament to the insatiable Love of Cinema, as Art, that the Europeans unabashedly utilize, like the Hug. They are not shy about physical displays of such Affection. That is the essence of this Film. Leone is a Lover and a Hugger. He is constantly hugging this Movie Loving every minute of it. He Loves the Genre, He Loves the Camera, He loves the Actors Faces, He loves the Landscape, he loves the Mythology, He just Loves and Loves. All that is apparent on the screen. Most likely that is why it is so lengthy. He Loved it all. What emerges is an Authentic Fantasy. There is on display a gorgeousity of grandeur that is quite a sight. Behold its panorama and its larger than Life Characters with their own quirky Personas and accompanying Musical Riffs. This is so playful and fun. It is all done for the Lovers of the World. Mostly, the Lovers of Movies.

    One thing I love about Sergio Leone's style as a director is his execution of telling a story in that while there are moments that have a purpose in progressing in the story, we can appreciate the moments where not much is happening, allowing more room for reflecting, whether it is beauty of the atmosphere in the world these characters live in or how the music is given a chance to evoke the emotions and be its own character. To sum up with more clarity, Sergio Leone made me learn to appreciate films that chooses to take its time, where all the little subtleties are the ones that add the most richness to a film's quality. It made me realize that there doesn't have to be things happening every minute in a movie to truly enjoy it. If I were to describe this stylistic aspect of Leone's directing, I would say he is able to inject a feeling of richness in his stories that makes his films feel very warm in tone, all the while being stories with a lot of grit and sharp edges. With 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' this was the first time this specific quality became evident to me in movies. From all the vast landscapes filmed for specific scenes, we feel more like we are delving into a world of beauty that is rarely visited, than watching a mere movie. How Sergio Leone is able to make his films feel larger than life is an astounding achievement and inspiration for those with an artistic vision. And every acting performance is delivered with a sense of sophistication and grace in adding to this rich story. And with every performance, we are presented with characters that are memorable and pivotal to the world they exist in. The world that exists in the film is filled with dirt and grit, and how these characters behave are evident of the world they live in. And this world that we see is the death of the west and the ushering in of a new era. These characters all play a pivotal point in that, but what plays out in the end is a revelation that brings out the full picture of what lurks underneath the motives that fuels each event that occurs, to bring everything full circle. And the way the movie ends on this note is moving. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a dark western filled with a lot of melancholy, but still possessing a quality of rich beauty. Underneath all the scenes of violence, there is an emotionally undercurrent that manages to seep through and how Sergio Leone is able to convey those emotions with so much subtlety shows the true mark of a great director. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a classic not only due to its ambition, but also in how grand it feels in every sense of the word.

    Sergio Leone's follow up to his superlative "Man With No Name" trilogy is highly acclaimed in some circles, a bit too much so to be honest, but is still a well acted story of a woman(beautiful Claudia Cardinale) who comes to the west as a mail-order-bride, only to find that her would-be family was wiped out by a cold-hearted gunfighter(Henry Fonda, cast effectively against type). She nonetheless vows to carry on, and is later helped by a man known as Harmonica(Charles Bronson) who has also vowed to kill the same man that killed her family. Sprawling story details the westward expansion by train that transformed America irrevocably, ending many ways of life. I did like this film, it is stylish and ambitious, with a good score, but it does become tedious at times, not to mention uncomfortable(Fonda's scenes with Cardinale, for instance...) I just didn't like it anywhere near as much as "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly", but film is still memorable, just not a "classic".

    Once Upon A Time In The West is a quite simply a masterpiece. No film has ever had the same effect on me. I shan't repeat the many eloquent reviews on here which wax lyrically about Leone's beautiful direction, Morricone's sublime score, and the four perfect lead performances.....there would be no point as i agree wholeheartedly. I will instead just list some of the many small moments in this incredible film, moments which make the experience of viewing Leone's epic even greater than the sum of those aforementioned parts: The expression on Henry Fonda's face as he confronts little Timmy McBain, and the sneer in his voice as he tells Morton "People scare better when they're dying!"....has there ever been a more coldblooded villain in movie history? Claudia Cardinale's brown eyes. Charles Bronson and Jason Robards' putdowns. "You know music- and you can count. All the way up to two!" "Do you know a man with a harmonica? He's someone you'd remember. Instead of talking he plays- and when he'd better play, he talks." THAT opening sequence.... THAT shot as Jill arrives at the station, the camera swooping up and over the building to reveal the entire town. And finally, a heartfelt conversation between the film's two most pitiless characters,and bitterest enemies, before their final showdown about how there's no place for their kind anymore in the new civilized America. Leone's previous 3 westerns, particularly his celebrated The Good The Bad & The Ugly, were remarkable movies in their own right. It's a measure of what a triumph Once Upon A Time In The West is that it easily tops them all, along with every other western- yes, even Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch.

    With "Once upon a time in the West" Sergio Leone made an another masterpiece. "Once upon a time in the West" is a movie which has action and is a classic western, it has gunfires and all of that. It's one of the best western movies of all time. This movie has to do with an assassin who wants to kill a widow and from the other hand we have a mysterious and strange man who protects this beautiful widow from the assassin. Claudia Cardinale (Jill McBain - the beautiful widow) makes a great interpretation and she is a pleasant presence who beautifies the movie. Henry Fonda (Frank) and Charles Bronson (Harmonica) made an also good interpretations.

    For me, no other movie has captured the Wild West like Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West. When a mysterious stranger with a harmonica protects a beautiful but naive widow from a ruthless train baron and his hired gun, they all soon discover that much more than prized land is at stake.This is more than a movie, it's an experience in my mind, a piece of history, as the west is portrayed as a haunting brutal land that discriminates against absolutely no-one. From the eerie silent opening to the unimaginable and unforgettable ending, Leone takes you down a path that hasn't been explored in a western before or since. 10 outta 10 guaranteed!!!

    Epic story of a mysterious stranger with a harmonica who joins forces with a notorious desperado to protect a beautiful widow from a ruthless assassin working for the railroad. From Sergio Leone comes another classic Spaghetti Western, that movie is his 1968 masterwork, Once Upon A Time In The West. Once Upon A Time In The West is a classic movie, it is one of Leone's finest works, an it is just as great as, if not better, than "The Man With No Name" Trilogy. This movie is beautifully shot, it's powerfully written, it's powerfully acted, and it's superbly directed. Leone was a genius, he was the master of Spaghetti Westerns, he previously had achieved greatness with his classic trilogy featuring "The Man With No Name," and here, he achieve more greatness, and then he would achieve more greatness with his final movie, his 1984 gangster epic, Once Upon A Time In America. But this movie is wonderful, it's a classic that is one of the best of the Western genre, as well as the Spaghetti Western genre, in short, this movie is pretty perfect. As with many of Leone's other works, Once Upon A Time In The West has a stellar line-up in the casting. Charles Bronson leads the cast as Harmonica, a mysterious harmonica-playing stranger who joins forces with a man named Cheyenne to take out a ruthless assassin. Bronson was known for tough guy roles, and here, he is superb, this is probably his best performance. The always wonderful Jason Robards plays Cheyenne, a bandit who is framed for some murders that he did not commit. Claudia Cardinale is not wasted as Jill McBain, a woman whose family has been murdered and is going along with Cheyenne and Robards to find the killer. Lastly, Henry Fonda is chilling as Frank, one of the greatest movie villains of all time. Fonda was usually known for playing the hero, but here, he played the villain, and he was outstanding in doing so. Along with the acting, we have got a very fine music score from Ennio Morricone, who worked with Leone on many of his films. Many people consider Once Upon A Time In The West to be Leone's finest work. I agree with that, as this movie is outstanding, and it is just as great as, if not better than, "The Man With No Name" trilogy. The movie is nearly three hours long, but it does not seem that long as the film moves quickly with powerful storytelling and wonderful performances. I agree with the critics, Once Upon A Time In The West is a masterpiece of cinema, it defines the meaning of the words, great movies, and it redefines the Western genre as a whole. I send my posthumous applauds to all of those involved, especially to Charles Bronson and Jason Robards. Henry Fonda gets the most applauds, as he was in a class by himself. How he could portray so perfectly a coldblooded killer with absolutely no redeeming features is beyond my imagination. And something else, when he made the movie, Henry Fonda was 63, but he certainly did not appear 63, he appeared much younger. Anyway, Once Upon A Time In The West is better than the hype surrounding it, do not miss the masterpiece. 10/10

And this world that we see is the death of the west and the ushering in of a new era. These characters all play a pivotal point in that, but what plays out in the end is a revelation that brings out the full picture of what lurks underneath the motives that fuels each event that occurs, to bring everything full circle. And the way the movie ends on this note is moving. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a dark western filled with a lot of melancholy, but still possessing a quality of rich beauty. Underneath all the scenes of violence, there is an emotionally undercurrent that manages to seep through and how Sergio Leone is able to convey those emotions with so much subtlety shows the true mark of a great director. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a classic not only due to its ambition, but also in how grand it feels in every sense of the word.

    Sergio Leone's follow up to his superlative "Man With No Name" trilogy is highly acclaimed in some circles, a bit too much so to be honest, but is still a well acted story of a woman(beautiful Claudia Cardinale) who comes to the west as a mail-order-bride, only to find that her would-be family was wiped out by a cold-hearted gunfighter(Henry Fonda, cast effectively against type). She nonetheless vows to carry on, and is later helped by a man known as Harmonica(Charles Bronson) who has also vowed to kill the same man that killed her family. Sprawling story details the westward expansion by train that transformed America irrevocably, ending many ways of life. I did like this film, it is stylish and ambitious, with a good score, but it does become tedious at times, not to mention uncomfortable(Fonda's scenes with Cardinale, for instance...) I just didn't like it anywhere near as much as "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly", but film is still memorable, just not a "classic".

    Once Upon A Time In The West is a quite simply a masterpiece. No film has ever had the same effect on me. I shan't repeat the many eloquent reviews on here which wax lyrically about Leone's beautiful direction, Morricone's sublime score, and the four perfect lead performances.....there would be no point as i agree wholeheartedly. I will instead just list some of the many small moments in this incredible film, moments which make the experience of viewing Leone's epic even greater than the sum of those aforementioned parts: The expression on Henry Fonda's face as he confronts little Timmy McBain, and the sneer in his voice as he tells Morton "People scare better when they're dying!"....has there ever been a more coldblooded villain in movie history? Claudia Cardinale's brown eyes. Charles Bronson and Jason Robards' putdowns. "You know music- and you can count. All the way up to two!" "Do you know a man with a harmonica? He's someone you'd remember. Instead of talking he plays- and when he'd better play, he talks." THAT opening sequence.... THAT shot as Jill arrives at the station, the camera swooping up and over the building to reveal the entire town. And finally, a heartfelt conversation between the film's two most pitiless characters,and bitterest enemies, before their final showdown about how there's no place for their kind anymore in the new civilized America. Leone's previous 3 westerns, particularly his celebrated The Good The Bad & The Ugly, were remarkable movies in their own right. It's a measure of what a triumph Once Upon A Time In The West is that it easily tops them all, along with every other western- yes, even Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch.

    With "Once upon a time in the West" Sergio Leone made an another masterpiece. "Once upon a time in the West" is a movie which has action and is a classic western, it has gunfires and all of that. It's one of the best western movies of all time. This movie has to do with an assassin who wants to kill a widow and from the other hand we have a mysterious and strange man who protects this beautiful widow from the assassin. Claudia Cardinale (Jill McBain - the beautiful widow) makes a great interpretation and she is a pleasant presence who beautifies the movie. Henry Fonda (Frank) and Charles Bronson (Harmonica) made an also good interpretations.

    For me, no other movie has captured the Wild West like Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West. When a mysterious stranger with a harmonica protects a beautiful but naive widow from a ruthless train baron and his hired gun, they all soon discover that much more than prized land is at stake.This is more than a movie, it's an experience in my mind, a piece of history, as the west is portrayed as a haunting brutal land that discriminates against absolutely no-one. From the eerie silent opening to the unimaginable and unforgettable ending, Leone takes you down a path that hasn't been explored in a western before or since. 10 outta 10 guaranteed!!!

    Epic story of a mysterious stranger with a harmonica who joins forces with a notorious desperado to protect a beautiful widow from a ruthless assassin working for the railroad. From Sergio Leone comes another classic Spaghetti Western, that movie is his 1968 masterwork, Once Upon A Time In The West. Once Upon A Time In The West is a classic movie, it is one of Leone's finest works, an it is just as great as, if not better, than "The Man With No Name" Trilogy. This movie is beautifully shot, it's powerfully written, it's powerfully acted, and it's superbly directed. Leone was a genius, he was the master of Spaghetti Westerns, he previously had achieved greatness with his classic trilogy featuring "The Man With No Name," and here, he achieve more greatness, and then he would achieve more greatness with his final movie, his 1984 gangster epic, Once Upon A Time In America. But this movie is wonderful, it's a classic that is one of the best of the Western genre, as well as the Spaghetti Western genre, in short, this movie is pretty perfect. As with many of Leone's other works, Once Upon A Time In The West has a stellar line-up in the casting. Charles Bronson leads the cast as Harmonica, a mysterious harmonica-playing stranger who joins forces with a man named Cheyenne to take out a ruthless assassin. Bronson was known for tough guy roles, and here, he is superb, this is probably his best performance. The always wonderful Jason Robards plays Cheyenne, a bandit who is framed for some murders that he did not commit. Claudia Cardinale is not wasted as Jill McBain, a woman whose family has been murdered and is going along with Cheyenne and Robards to find the killer. Lastly, Henry Fonda is chilling as Frank, one of the greatest movie villains of all time. Fonda was usually known for playing the hero, but here, he played the villain, and he was outstanding in doing so. Along with the acting, we have got a very fine music score from Ennio Morricone, who worked with Leone on many of his films. Many people consider Once Upon A Time In The West to be Leone's finest work. I agree with that, as this movie is outstanding, and it is just as great as, if not better than, "The Man With No Name" trilogy. The movie is nearly three hours long, but it does not seem that long as the film moves quickly with powerful storytelling and wonderful performances. I agree with the critics, Once Upon A Time In The West is a masterpiece of cinema, it defines the meaning of the words, great movies, and it redefines the Western genre as a whole. I send my posthumous applauds to all of those involved, especially to Charles Bronson and Jason Robards. Henry Fonda gets the most applauds, as he was in a class by himself. How he could portray so perfectly a coldblooded killer with absolutely no redeeming features is beyond my imagination. And something else, when he made the movie, Henry Fonda was 63, but he certainly did not appear 63, he appeared much younger. Anyway, Once Upon A Time In The West is better than the hype surrounding it, do not miss the masterpiece. 10/10

    I just got around to viewing this last week on Netflix... Since last weekend I have watched it a further three times and will readily concur with many others on this board that this is my favourite film of all time... It has to be; I've wracked my cranium for the last few days trying to think of another that moved me so profoundly, and nothing comes to mind... The ten minute (or so) gun battle/flashback sequence with Frank and Harmonica had me both crying and goosebump-ridden, Morricone's soaring, amplified guitar playing throughout that sequence left me in such a state of exhilaration that I can't quite express it properly... I found myself having to pull it together to watch the last brilliant 15 or so minutes... Others have described the pace of this film as being "slow"; to those who haven't seen this film, doing confuse this with boring! Like a great book I was sad to see it end, and have returned to it repeatedly over the past few days, appreciating it more every time...

    I personally don't watch a lot of westerns. But if I did, I'm sure this would be one of the top ones. It is slow and intense, the story is thrilling, and you capture the whole feeling of the old American ways. Think younger generations, can't appreciate the movie on a higher level, like the people that were alive when it came out. I'm sure this was what people wanted back then, and the movie delivered. Just like there is a "superhero" era right now, westerns were just as hyped in their own day. This is actually a decent movie, even if you are not fan of the genre. 8 out of 10

    Once Upon A Time In The West is one of the greatest Westerns ever made and a unforgettable,Epic Masterpiece from beginning to end. Filled with powerful direction,great acting,beautiful photography and a brilliant score,Once Upon A Time In The West is not only one of the greatest Westerns of all time,but also one of the greatest films ever made,one of my all-time favorite films and Sergio Leone at his best. Once Upon A Time In The West tells the story of a mysterious stranger named Harmonica(Charles Bronson)who teams up with outlaw Cheyanne(Jason Robards)to protect widow Jill McBain,a former hooker now wife and widow(Claudia Cardinale)from ruthless killer Frank(Henry Fonda)who wants Jill's railroad. Now,Harmonica and Cheyanne must defend and fight for Jill and stop Frank at all costs. Once Upon A Time In The West is a Classic Masterpiece of Cinema that right from the very start has you glued to the screen and give viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that is a large epic not only in scope but in length. Director Sergio Leone gives viewers a different Western than his excellent and Masterful Dollars/Man With No Name Trilogy especially with The Good,The Bad,And The Ugly. I guess that is one of the reasons Once Upon A Time In The West was overlooked when it came out in 1969 because it was a different film than The Man With No Name Trilogy in other words if the Man With No Name Trilogy were Action packed Westerns with big ambitions than Once Upon A Time In The West is a visual Art film Western. Leone takes the epic scope of TG,TB&TU and expands on it with this film giving us a powerful film that has more visuals than dialog and more drama than Action and also pays tribute to the great Western genre taking the trademarks and familiar things that are in a Western film and turning the trademarks on their head and raises the trademarks to a higher level. One of the great things about OUTITW is that this film is more about visuals and tone than it is about dialog because with this film we are shown and given images that are not just there just to be there but add to the story and makes understand what's going on in with the story and the characters who they are and what their motivations are. The images are haunting and at the same time beautiful and add to the films power and greatness. OUATTW doesn't have a lot of dialog but when the dialog is said it is great and memorable making the characters feel gritty and real. It's interesting that OUATTW and Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyseey came out in the same year and while both films are in different genres(Western and Science Fiction)both films are alike in terms of using visuals and little dialog. Leone and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli give OUATTW a beautiful visual style making the West look romantic and epic while at the same time making the film gritty and true to how the old West really was. The style is Spagetti Western but is filmed like a Hollywood Western of the 1940s and 50s All though the film is long(2 Hrs and 45 Minutes)OUATTW moves at a great pace and there is not a wasted scene in the film because OUATTW is one of those films that is so excellent that you want the film to be longer and keep going. The four main characters Jill,Frank,Harmonica and Cheyanne are great characters who represent the classic Western movie standards and arch types(hooker,killer,mysterious gunfighter-gunslinger,outlaw)but the four of them are presented in a larger than life way and are stylized but at the same time feel very real. With the exception of Frank the other main characters Jill,Harmonica and Cheyanne are given a moral ambiguity and have gray areas where you feel sympathy for the three of them and wonder what will happen with the three of them. Although this is not an Action film there are enough Western gunfights to satisfy Western and Action viewers and when the Action happens it is fast and intense. The final 15-20 minutes builds into one of the best endings in film history because it is filled with tension,suspense,surprises and at the same time sad and optimistic. It's an excellent and unforgettable ending you will not forget. The whole cast is great in their roles. Claudia Cardinale is excellent and beautiful as Jill McBain,with Cardinale holding her own against Bronson,Fonda and Robards. Henry Fonda is brilliant and intense as Frank,one of the greatest villains in film history. Fonda is cold and pure evil and you'll never forget his performance. Charles Bronson is wonderful and mysterious as Harmonica,a quiet gunslinger who plays the Harmonica and has great scenes with Cardinale,Fonda and Robards. Jason Robards is great and humorous as Cheyanne,an outlaw that helps out Harmonica and Jill. Gabriele Ferzetti is amazing as Morton,the railroad baron who is also Frank's boss. Frank Wolf(Brett McBain),Lionel Stander(Barman),Paolo Stoppa(Sam)and Keenen Wynn(Sheriif-Auctioneer)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Western favorites like Woody Strode(Stony-Member of Frank's gang)and Jack Elam(Snaky-Member of Frank's gang). The direction by Sergio Leone is excellent,masterful and powerful,with Leone always moving the camera,using great angles and intense close-ups bringing a unique visual style to the film. Great direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is brilliant,beautiful,unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history,with Morricone's score matching the tone and powerful of each scene. A masterful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Westerns or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In The West,a true Masterpiece of the Western genre and a Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    In an age of quick cuts, shaky Camera and CGI, this Film will likely be a hard watch for the post ADD Generation. It is SLOW. The Cinematography lingers. The lines of Dialog are at the most minimum. It is LONG. So why is this considered one of the best Westerns ever. Because it is. An achievement that is a testament to the insatiable Love of Cinema, as Art, that the Europeans unabashedly utilize, like the Hug. They are not shy about physical displays of such Affection. That is the essence of this Film. Leone is a Lover and a Hugger. He is constantly hugging this Movie Loving every minute of it. He Loves the Genre, He Loves the Camera, He loves the Actors Faces, He loves the Landscape, he loves the Mythology, He just Loves and Loves. All that is apparent on the screen. Most likely that is why it is so lengthy. He Loved it all. What emerges is an Authentic Fantasy. There is on display a gorgeousity of grandeur that is quite a sight. Behold its panorama and its larger than Life Characters with their own quirky Personas and accompanying Musical Riffs. This is so playful and fun. It is all done for the Lovers of the World. Mostly, the Lovers of Movies.

    One thing I love about Sergio Leone's style as a director is his execution of telling a story in that while there are moments that have a purpose in progressing in the story, we can appreciate the moments where not much is happening, allowing more room for reflecting, whether it is beauty of the atmosphere in the world these characters live in or how the music is given a chance to evoke the emotions and be its own character. To sum up with more clarity, Sergio Leone made me learn to appreciate films that chooses to take its time, where all the little subtleties are the ones that add the most richness to a film's quality. It made me realize that there doesn't have to be things happening every minute in a movie to truly enjoy it. If I were to describe this stylistic aspect of Leone's directing, I would say he is able to inject a feeling of richness in his stories that makes his films feel very warm in tone, all the while being stories with a lot of grit and sharp edges. With 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' this was the first time this specific quality became evident to me in movies. From all the vast landscapes filmed for specific scenes, we feel more like we are delving into a world of beauty that is rarely visited, than watching a mere movie. How Sergio Leone is able to make his films feel larger than life is an astounding achievement and inspiration for those with an artistic vision. And every acting performance is delivered with a sense of sophistication and grace in adding to this rich story. And with every performance, we are presented with characters that are memorable and pivotal to the world they exist in. The world that exists in the film is filled with dirt and grit, and how these characters behave are evident of the world they live in. And this world that we see is the death of the west and the ushering in of a new era. These characters all play a pivotal point in that, but what plays out in the end is a revelation that brings out the full picture of what lurks underneath the motives that fuels each event that occurs, to bring everything full circle. And the way the movie ends on this note is moving. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a dark western filled with a lot of melancholy, but still possessing a quality of rich beauty. Underneath all the scenes of violence, there is an emotionally undercurrent that manages to seep through and how Sergio Leone is able to convey those emotions with so much subtlety shows the true mark of a great director. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a classic not only due to its ambition, but also in how grand it feels in every sense of the word.

    I personally don't watch a lot of westerns. But if I did, I'm sure this would be one of the top ones. It is slow and intense, the story is thrilling, and you capture the whole feeling of the old American ways. Think younger generations, can't appreciate the movie on a higher level, like the people that were alive when it came out. I'm sure this was what people wanted back then, and the movie delivered. Just like there is a "superhero" era right now, westerns were just as hyped in their own day. This is actually a decent movie, even if you are not fan of the genre. 8 out of 10

    Once Upon A Time In The West is one of the greatest Westerns ever made and a unforgettable,Epic Masterpiece from beginning to end. Filled with powerful direction,great acting,beautiful photography and a brilliant score,Once Upon A Time In The West is not only one of the greatest Westerns of all time,but also one of the greatest films ever made,one of my all-time favorite films and Sergio Leone at his best. Once Upon A Time In The West tells the story of a mysterious stranger named Harmonica(Charles Bronson)who teams up with outlaw Cheyanne(Jason Robards)to protect widow Jill McBain,a former hooker now wife and widow(Claudia Cardinale)from ruthless killer Frank(Henry Fonda)who wants Jill's railroad. Now,Harmonica and Cheyanne must defend and fight for Jill and stop Frank at all costs. Once Upon A Time In The West is a Classic Masterpiece of Cinema that right from the very start has you glued to the screen and give viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that is a large epic not only in scope but in length. Director Sergio Leone gives viewers a different Western than his excellent and Masterful Dollars/Man With No Name Trilogy especially with The Good,The Bad,And The Ugly. I guess that is one of the reasons Once Upon A Time In The West was overlooked when it came out in 1969 because it was a different film than The Man With No Name Trilogy in other words if the Man With No Name Trilogy were Action packed Westerns with big ambitions than Once Upon A Time In The West is a visual Art film Western. Leone takes the epic scope of TG,TB&TU and expands on it with this film giving us a powerful film that has more visuals than dialog and more drama than Action and also pays tribute to the great Western genre taking the trademarks and familiar things that are in a Western film and turning the trademarks on their head and raises the trademarks to a higher level. One of the great things about OUTITW is that this film is more about visuals and tone than it is about dialog because with this film we are shown and given images that are not just there just to be there but add to the story and makes understand what's going on in with the story and the characters who they are and what their motivations are. The images are haunting and at the same time beautiful and add to the films power and greatness. OUATTW doesn't have a lot of dialog but when the dialog is said it is great and memorable making the characters feel gritty and real. It's interesting that OUATTW and Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyseey came out in the same year and while both films are in different genres(Western and Science Fiction)both films are alike in terms of using visuals and little dialog. Leone and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli give OUATTW a beautiful visual style making the West look romantic and epic while at the same time making the film gritty and true to how the old West really was. The style is Spagetti Western but is filmed like a Hollywood Western of the 1940s and 50s All though the film is long(2 Hrs and 45 Minutes)OUATTW moves at a great pace and there is not a wasted scene in the film because OUATTW is one of those films that is so excellent that you want the film to be longer and keep going. The four main characters Jill,Frank,Harmonica and Cheyanne are great characters who represent the classic Western movie standards and arch types(hooker,killer,mysterious gunfighter-gunslinger,outlaw)but the four of them are presented in a larger than life way and are stylized but at the same time feel very real. With the exception of Frank the other main characters Jill,Harmonica and Cheyanne are given a moral ambiguity and have gray areas where you feel sympathy for the three of them and wonder what will happen with the three of them. Although this is not an Action film there are enough Western gunfights to satisfy Western and Action viewers and when the Action happens it is fast and intense. The final 15-20 minutes builds into one of the best endings in film history because it is filled with tension,suspense,surprises and at the same time sad and optimistic. It's an excellent and unforgettable ending you will not forget. The whole cast is great in their roles. Claudia Cardinale is excellent and beautiful as Jill McBain,with Cardinale holding her own against Bronson,Fonda and Robards. Henry Fonda is brilliant and intense as Frank,one of the greatest villains in film history. Fonda is cold and pure evil and you'll never forget his performance. Charles Bronson is wonderful and mysterious as Harmonica,a quiet gunslinger who plays the Harmonica and has great scenes with Cardinale,Fonda and Robards. Jason Robards is great and humorous as Cheyanne,an outlaw that helps out Harmonica and Jill. Gabriele Ferzetti is amazing as Morton,the railroad baron who is also Frank's boss. Frank Wolf(Brett McBain),Lionel Stander(Barman),Paolo Stoppa(Sam)and Keenen Wynn(Sheriif-Auctioneer)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Western favorites like Woody Strode(Stony-Member of Frank's gang)and Jack Elam(Snaky-Member of Frank's gang). The direction by Sergio Leone is excellent,masterful and powerful,with Leone always moving the camera,using great angles and intense close-ups bringing a unique visual style to the film. Great direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is brilliant,beautiful,unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history,with Morricone's score matching the tone and powerful of each scene. A masterful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Westerns or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In The West,a true Masterpiece of the Western genre and a Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    In an age of quick cuts, shaky Camera and CGI, this Film will likely be a hard watch for the post ADD Generation. It is SLOW. The Cinematography lingers. The lines of Dialog are at the most minimum. It is LONG. So why is this considered one of the best Westerns ever. Because it is. An achievement that is a testament to the insatiable Love of Cinema, as Art, that the Europeans unabashedly utilize, like the Hug. They are not shy about physical displays of such Affection. That is the essence of this Film. Leone is a Lover and a Hugger. He is constantly hugging this Movie Loving every minute of it. He Loves the Genre, He Loves the Camera, He loves the Actors Faces, He loves the Landscape, he loves the Mythology, He just Loves and Loves. All that is apparent on the screen. Most likely that is why it is so lengthy. He Loved it all. What emerges is an Authentic Fantasy. There is on display a gorgeousity of grandeur that is quite a sight. Behold its panorama and its larger than Life Characters with their own quirky Personas and accompanying Musical Riffs. This is so playful and fun. It is all done for the Lovers of the World. Mostly, the Lovers of Movies.

    One thing I love about Sergio Leone's style as a director is his execution of telling a story in that while there are moments that have a purpose in progressing in the story, we can appreciate the moments where not much is happening, allowing more room for reflecting, whether it is beauty of the atmosphere in the world these characters live in or how the music is given a chance to evoke the emotions and be its own character. To sum up with more clarity, Sergio Leone made me learn to appreciate films that chooses to take its time, where all the little subtleties are the ones that add the most richness to a film's quality. It made me realize that there doesn't have to be things happening every minute in a movie to truly enjoy it. If I were to describe this stylistic aspect of Leone's directing, I would say he is able to inject a feeling of richness in his stories that makes his films feel very warm in tone, all the while being stories with a lot of grit and sharp edges. With 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' this was the first time this specific quality became evident to me in movies. From all the vast landscapes filmed for specific scenes, we feel more like we are delving into a world of beauty that is rarely visited, than watching a mere movie. How Sergio Leone is able to make his films feel larger than life is an astounding achievement and inspiration for those with an artistic vision. And every acting performance is delivered with a sense of sophistication and grace in adding to this rich story. And with every performance, we are presented with characters that are memorable and pivotal to the world they exist in. The world that exists in the film is filled with dirt and grit, and how these characters behave are evident of the world they live in. And this world that we see is the death of the west and the ushering in of a new era. These characters all play a pivotal point in that, but what plays out in the end is a revelation that brings out the full picture of what lurks underneath the motives that fuels each event that occurs, to bring everything full circle. And the way the movie ends on this note is moving. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a dark western filled with a lot of melancholy, but still possessing a quality of rich beauty. Underneath all the scenes of violence, there is an emotionally undercurrent that manages to seep through and how Sergio Leone is able to convey those emotions with so much subtlety shows the true mark of a great director. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a classic not only due to its ambition, but also in how grand it feels in every sense of the word.

    Sergio Leone's follow up to his superlative "Man With No Name" trilogy is highly acclaimed in some circles, a bit too much so to be honest, but is still a well acted story of a woman(beautiful Claudia Cardinale) who comes to the west as a mail-order-bride, only to find that her would-be family was wiped out by a cold-hearted gunfighter(Henry Fonda, cast effectively against type). She nonetheless vows to carry on, and is later helped by a man known as Harmonica(Charles Bronson) who has also vowed to kill the same man that killed her family. Sprawling story details the westward expansion by train that transformed America irrevocably, ending many ways of life. I did like this film, it is stylish and ambitious, with a good score, but it does become tedious at times, not to mention uncomfortable(Fonda's scenes with Cardinale, for instance...) I just didn't like it anywhere near as much as "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly", but film is still memorable, just not a "classic".

    Once Upon A Time In The West is a quite simply a masterpiece. No film has ever had the same effect on me. I shan't repeat the many eloquent reviews on here which wax lyrically about Leone's beautiful direction, Morricone's sublime score, and the four perfect lead performances.....there would be no point as i agree wholeheartedly. I will instead just list some of the many small moments in this incredible film, moments which make the experience of viewing Leone's epic even greater than the sum of those aforementioned parts: The expression on Henry Fonda's face as he confronts little Timmy McBain, and the sneer in his voice as he tells Morton "People scare better when they're dying!"....has there ever been a more coldblooded villain in movie history? Claudia Cardinale's brown eyes. Charles Bronson and Jason Robards' putdowns. "You know music- and you can count. All the way up to two!" "Do you know a man with a harmonica? He's someone you'd remember. Instead of talking he plays- and when he'd better play, he talks." THAT opening sequence.... THAT shot as Jill arrives at the station, the camera swooping up and over the building to reveal the entire town. And finally, a heartfelt conversation between the film's two most pitiless characters,and bitterest enemies, before their final showdown about how there's no place for their kind anymore in the new civilized America. Leone's previous 3 westerns, particularly his celebrated The Good The Bad & The Ugly, were remarkable movies in their own right. It's a measure of what a triumph Once Upon A Time In The West is that it easily tops them all, along with every other western- yes, even Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch.

    With "Once upon a time in the West" Sergio Leone made an another masterpiece. "Once upon a time in the West" is a movie which has action and is a classic western, it has gunfires and all of that. It's one of the best western movies of all time. This movie has to do with an assassin who wants to kill a widow and from the other hand we have a mysterious and strange man who protects this beautiful widow from the assassin. Claudia Cardinale (Jill McBain - the beautiful widow) makes a great interpretation and she is a pleasant presence who beautifies the movie. Henry Fonda (Frank) and Charles Bronson (Harmonica) made an also good interpretations.

    For me, no other movie has captured the Wild West like Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West. When a mysterious stranger with a harmonica protects a beautiful but naive widow from a ruthless train baron and his hired gun, they all soon discover that much more than prized land is at stake.This is more than a movie, it's an experience in my mind, a piece of history, as the west is portrayed as a haunting brutal land that discriminates against absolutely no-one. From the eerie silent opening to the unimaginable and unforgettable ending, Leone takes you down a path that hasn't been explored in a western before or since. 10 outta 10 guaranteed!!!

    Epic story of a mysterious stranger with a harmonica who joins forces with a notorious desperado to protect a beautiful widow from a ruthless assassin working for the railroad. From Sergio Leone comes another classic Spaghetti Western, that movie is his 1968 masterwork, Once Upon A Time In The West. Once Upon A Time In The West is a classic movie, it is one of Leone's finest works, an it is just as great as, if not better, than "The Man With No Name" Trilogy. This movie is beautifully shot, it's powerfully written, it's powerfully acted, and it's superbly directed. Leone was a genius, he was the master of Spaghetti Westerns, he previously had achieved greatness with his classic trilogy featuring "The Man With No Name," and here, he achieve more greatness, and then he would achieve more greatness with his final movie, his 1984 gangster epic, Once Upon A Time In America. But this movie is wonderful, it's a classic that is one of the best of the Western genre, as well as the Spaghetti Western genre, in short, this movie is pretty perfect. As with many of Leone's other works, Once Upon A Time In The West has a stellar line-up in the casting. Charles Bronson leads the cast as Harmonica, a mysterious harmonica-playing stranger who joins forces with a man named Cheyenne to take out a ruthless assassin. Bronson was known for tough guy roles, and here, he is superb, this is probably his best performance. The always wonderful Jason Robards plays Cheyenne, a bandit who is framed for some murders that he did not commit. Claudia Cardinale is not wasted as Jill McBain, a woman whose family has been murdered and is going along with Cheyenne and Robards to find the killer. Lastly, Henry Fonda is chilling as Frank, one of the greatest movie villains of all time. Fonda was usually known for playing the hero, but here, he played the villain, and he was outstanding in doing so. Along with the acting, we have got a very fine music score from Ennio Morricone, who worked with Leone on many of his films. Many people consider Once Upon A Time In The West to be Leone's finest work. I agree with that, as this movie is outstanding, and it is just as great as, if not better than, "The Man With No Name" trilogy. The movie is nearly three hours long, but it does not seem that long as the film moves quickly with powerful storytelling and wonderful performances. I agree with the critics, Once Upon A Time In The West is a masterpiece of cinema, it defines the meaning of the words, great movies, and it redefines the Western genre as a whole. I send my posthumous applauds to all of those involved, especially to Charles Bronson and Jason Robards. Henry Fonda gets the most applauds, as he was in a class by himself. How he could portray so perfectly a coldblooded killer with absolutely no redeeming features is beyond my imagination. And something else, when he made the movie, Henry Fonda was 63, but he certainly did not appear 63, he appeared much younger. Anyway, Once Upon A Time In The West is better than the hype surrounding it, do not miss the masterpiece. 10/10

    I just got around to viewing this last week on Netflix... Since last weekend I have watched it a further three times and will readily concur with many others on this board that this is my favourite film of all time... It has to be; I've wracked my cranium for the last few days trying to think of another that moved me so profoundly, and nothing comes to mind... The ten minute (or so) gun battle/flashback sequence with Frank and Harmonica had me both crying and goosebump-ridden, Morricone's soaring, amplified guitar playing throughout that sequence left me in such a state of exhilaration that I can't quite express it properly... I found myself having to pull it together to watch the last brilliant 15 or so minutes... Others have described the pace of this film as being "slow"; to those who haven't seen this film, doing confuse this with boring! Like a great book I was sad to see it end, and have returned to it repeatedly over the past few days, appreciating it more every time...

    Sergio Leone's follow up to his superlative "Man With No Name" trilogy is highly acclaimed in some circles, a bit too much so to be honest, but is still a well acted story of a woman(beautiful Claudia Cardinale) who comes to the west as a mail-order-bride, only to find that her would-be family was wiped out by a cold-hearted gunfighter(Henry Fonda, cast effectively against type). She nonetheless vows to carry on, and is later helped by a man known as Harmonica(Charles Bronson) who has also vowed to kill the same man that killed her family. Sprawling story details the westward expansion by train that transformed America irrevocably, ending many ways of life. I did like this film, it is stylish and ambitious, with a good score, but it does become tedious at times, not to mention uncomfortable(Fonda's scenes with Cardinale, for instance...) I just didn't like it anywhere near as much as "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly", but film is still memorable, just not a "classic".

    Once Upon A Time In The West is a quite simply a masterpiece. No film has ever had the same effect on me. I shan't repeat the many eloquent reviews on here which wax lyrically about Leone's beautiful direction, Morricone's sublime score, and the four perfect lead performances.....there would be no point as i agree wholeheartedly. I will instead just list some of the many small moments in this incredible film, moments which make the experience of viewing Leone's epic even greater than the sum of those aforementioned parts: The expression on Henry Fonda's face as he confronts little Timmy McBain, and the sneer in his voice as he tells Morton "People scare better when they're dying!"....has there ever been a more coldblooded villain in movie history? Claudia Cardinale's brown eyes. Charles Bronson and Jason Robards' putdowns. "You know music- and you can count. All the way up to two!" "Do you know a man with a harmonica? He's someone you'd remember. Instead of talking he plays- and when he'd better play, he talks." THAT opening sequence.... THAT shot as Jill arrives at the station, the camera swooping up and over the building to reveal the entire town. And finally, a heartfelt conversation between the film's two most pitiless characters,and bitterest enemies, before their final showdown about how there's no place for their kind anymore in the new civilized America. Leone's previous 3 westerns, particularly his celebrated The Good The Bad & The Ugly, were remarkable movies in their own right. It's a measure of what a triumph Once Upon A Time In The West is that it easily tops them all, along with every other western- yes, even Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch.

    With "Once upon a time in the West" Sergio Leone made an another masterpiece. "Once upon a time in the West" is a movie which has action and is a classic western, it has gunfires and all of that. It's one of the best western movies of all time. This movie has to do with an assassin who wants to kill a widow and from the other hand we have a mysterious and strange man who protects this beautiful widow from the assassin. Claudia Cardinale (Jill McBain - the beautiful widow) makes a great interpretation and she is a pleasant presence who beautifies the movie. Henry Fonda (Frank) and Charles Bronson (Harmonica) made an also good interpretations.

    For me, no other movie has captured the Wild West like Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West. When a mysterious stranger with a harmonica protects a beautiful but naive widow from a ruthless train baron and his hired gun, they all soon discover that much more than prized land is at stake.This is more than a movie, it's an experience in my mind, a piece of history, as the west is portrayed as a haunting brutal land that discriminates against absolutely no-one. From the eerie silent opening to the unimaginable and unforgettable ending, Leone takes you down a path that hasn't been explored in a western before or since. 10 outta 10 guaranteed!!!

    Epic story of a mysterious stranger with a harmonica who joins forces with a notorious desperado to protect a beautiful widow from a ruthless assassin working for the railroad. From Sergio Leone comes another classic Spaghetti Western, that movie is his 1968 masterwork, Once Upon A Time In The West. Once Upon A Time In The West is a classic movie, it is one of Leone's finest works, an it is just as great as, if not better, than "The Man With No Name" Trilogy. This movie is beautifully shot, it's powerfully written, it's powerfully acted, and it's superbly directed. Leone was a genius, he was the master of Spaghetti Westerns, he previously had achieved greatness with his classic trilogy featuring "The Man With No Name," and here, he achieve more greatness, and then he would achieve more greatness with his final movie, his 1984 gangster epic, Once Upon A Time In America. But this movie is wonderful, it's a classic that is one of the best of the Western genre, as well as the Spaghetti Western genre, in short, this movie is pretty perfect. As with many of Leone's other works, Once Upon A Time In The West has a stellar line-up in the casting. Charles Bronson leads the cast as Harmonica, a mysterious harmonica-playing stranger who joins forces with a man named Cheyenne to take out a ruthless assassin. Bronson was known for tough guy roles, and here, he is superb, this is probably his best performance. The always wonderful Jason Robards plays Cheyenne, a bandit who is framed for some murders that he did not commit. Claudia Cardinale is not wasted as Jill McBain, a woman whose family has been murdered and is going along with Cheyenne and Robards to find the killer. Lastly, Henry Fonda is chilling as Frank, one of the greatest movie villains of all time. Fonda was usually known for playing the hero, but here, he played the villain, and he was outstanding in doing so. Along with the acting, we have got a very fine music score from Ennio Morricone, who worked with Leone on many of his films. Many people consider Once Upon A Time In The West to be Leone's finest work. I agree with that, as this movie is outstanding, and it is just as great as, if not better than, "The Man With No Name" trilogy. The movie is nearly three hours long, but it does not seem that long as the film moves quickly with powerful storytelling and wonderful performances. I agree with the critics, Once Upon A Time In The West is a masterpiece of cinema, it defines the meaning of the words, great movies, and it redefines the Western genre as a whole. I send my posthumous applauds to all of those involved, especially to Charles Bronson and Jason Robards. Henry Fonda gets the most applauds, as he was in a class by himself. How he could portray so perfectly a coldblooded killer with absolutely no redeeming features is beyond my imagination. And something else, when he made the movie, Henry Fonda was 63, but he certainly did not appear 63, he appeared much younger. Anyway, Once Upon A Time In The West is better than the hype surrounding it, do not miss the masterpiece. 10/10

    I just got around to viewing this last week on Netflix... Since last weekend I have watched it a further three times and will readily concur with many others on this board that this is my favourite film of all time... It has to be; I've wracked my cranium for the last few days trying to think of another that moved me so profoundly, and nothing comes to mind... The ten minute (or so) gun battle/flashback sequence with Frank and Harmonica had me both crying and goosebump-ridden, Morricone's soaring, amplified guitar playing throughout that sequence left me in such a state of exhilaration that I can't quite express it properly... I found myself having to pull it together to watch the last brilliant 15 or so minutes... Others have described the pace of this film as being "slow"; to those who haven't seen this film, doing confuse this with boring! Like a great book I was sad to see it end, and have returned to it repeatedly over the past few days, appreciating it more every time...

    I personally don't watch a lot of westerns. But if I did, I'm sure this would be one of the top ones. It is slow and intense, the story is thrilling, and you capture the whole feeling of the old American ways. Think younger generations, can't appreciate the movie on a higher level, like the people that were alive when it came out. I'm sure this was what people wanted back then, and the movie delivered. Just like there is a "superhero" era right now, westerns were just as hyped in their own day. This is actually a decent movie, even if you are not fan of the genre. 8 out of 10

    Once Upon A Time In The West is one of the greatest Westerns ever made and a unforgettable,Epic Masterpiece from beginning to end. Filled with powerful direction,great acting,beautiful photography and a brilliant score,Once Upon A Time In The West is not only one of the greatest Westerns of all time,but also one of the greatest films ever made,one of my all-time favorite films and Sergio Leone at his best. Once Upon A Time In The West tells the story of a mysterious stranger named Harmonica(Charles Bronson)who teams up with outlaw Cheyanne(Jason Robards)to protect widow Jill McBain,a former hooker now wife and widow(Claudia Cardinale)from ruthless killer Frank(Henry Fonda)who wants Jill's railroad. Now,Harmonica and Cheyanne must defend and fight for Jill and stop Frank at all costs. Once Upon A Time In The West is a Classic Masterpiece of Cinema that right from the very start has you glued to the screen and give viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that is a large epic not only in scope but in length. Director Sergio Leone gives viewers a different Western than his excellent and Masterful Dollars/Man With No Name Trilogy especially with The Good,The Bad,And The Ugly. I guess that is one of the reasons Once Upon A Time In The West was overlooked when it came out in 1969 because it was a different film than The Man With No Name Trilogy in other words if the Man With No Name Trilogy were Action packed Westerns with big ambitions than Once Upon A Time In The West is a visual Art film Western. Leone takes the epic scope of TG,TB&TU and expands on it with this film giving us a powerful film that has more visuals than dialog and more drama than Action and also pays tribute to the great Western genre taking the trademarks and familiar things that are in a Western film and turning the trademarks on their head and raises the trademarks to a higher level. One of the great things about OUTITW is that this film is more about visuals and tone than it is about dialog because with this film we are shown and given images that are not just there just to be there but add to the story and makes understand what's going on in with the story and the characters who they are and what their motivations are. The images are haunting and at the same time beautiful and add to the films power and greatness. OUATTW doesn't have a lot of dialog but when the dialog is said it is great and memorable making the characters feel gritty and real. It's interesting that OUATTW and Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyseey came out in the same year and while both films are in different genres(Western and Science Fiction)both films are alike in terms of using visuals and little dialog. Leone and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli give OUATTW a beautiful visual style making the West look romantic and epic while at the same time making the film gritty and true to how the old West really was. The style is Spagetti Western but is filmed like a Hollywood Western of the 1940s and 50s All though the film is long(2 Hrs and 45 Minutes)OUATTW moves at a great pace and there is not a wasted scene in the film because OUATTW is one of those films that is so excellent that you want the film to be longer and keep going. The four main characters Jill,Frank,Harmonica and Cheyanne are great characters who represent the classic Western movie standards and arch types(hooker,killer,mysterious gunfighter-gunslinger,outlaw)but the four of them are presented in a larger than life way and are stylized but at the same time feel very real. With the exception of Frank the other main characters Jill,Harmonica and Cheyanne are given a moral ambiguity and have gray areas where you feel sympathy for the three of them and wonder what will happen with the three of them. Although this is not an Action film there are enough Western gunfights to satisfy Western and Action viewers and when the Action happens it is fast and intense. The final 15-20 minutes builds into one of the best endings in film history because it is filled with tension,suspense,surprises and at the same time sad and optimistic. It's an excellent and unforgettable ending you will not forget. The whole cast is great in their roles. Claudia Cardinale is excellent and beautiful as Jill McBain,with Cardinale holding her own against Bronson,Fonda and Robards. Henry Fonda is brilliant and intense as Frank,one of the greatest villains in film history. Fonda is cold and pure evil and you'll never forget his performance. Charles Bronson is wonderful and mysterious as Harmonica,a quiet gunslinger who plays the Harmonica and has great scenes with Cardinale,Fonda and Robards. Jason Robards is great and humorous as Cheyanne,an outlaw that helps out Harmonica and Jill. Gabriele Ferzetti is amazing as Morton,the railroad baron who is also Frank's boss. Frank Wolf(Brett McBain),Lionel Stander(Barman),Paolo Stoppa(Sam)and Keenen Wynn(Sheriif-Auctioneer)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Western favorites like Woody Strode(Stony-Member of Frank's gang)and Jack Elam(Snaky-Member of Frank's gang). The direction by Sergio Leone is excellent,masterful and powerful,with Leone always moving the camera,using great angles and intense close-ups bringing a unique visual style to the film. Great direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is brilliant,beautiful,unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history,with Morricone's score matching the tone and powerful of each scene. A masterful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Westerns or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In The West,a true Masterpiece of the Western genre and a Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    In an age of quick cuts, shaky Camera and CGI, this Film will likely be a hard watch for the post ADD Generation. It is SLOW. The Cinematography lingers. The lines of Dialog are at the most minimum. It is LONG. So why is this considered one of the best Westerns ever. Because it is. An achievement that is a testament to the insatiable Love of Cinema, as Art, that the Europeans unabashedly utilize, like the Hug. They are not shy about physical displays of such Affection. That is the essence of this Film. Leone is a Lover and a Hugger. He is constantly hugging this Movie Loving every minute of it. He Loves the Genre, He Loves the Camera, He loves the Actors Faces, He loves the Landscape, he loves the Mythology, He just Loves and Loves. All that is apparent on the screen. Most likely that is why it is so lengthy. He Loved it all. What emerges is an Authentic Fantasy. There is on display a gorgeousity of grandeur that is quite a sight. Behold its panorama and its larger than Life Characters with their own quirky Personas and accompanying Musical Riffs. This is so playful and fun. It is all done for the Lovers of the World. Mostly, the Lovers of Movies.

    One thing I love about Sergio Leone's style as a director is his execution of telling a story in that while there are moments that have a purpose in progressing in the story, we can appreciate the moments where not much is happening, allowing more room for reflecting, whether it is beauty of the atmosphere in the world these characters live in or how the music is given a chance to evoke the emotions and be its own character. To sum up with more clarity, Sergio Leone made me learn to appreciate films that chooses to take its time, where all the little subtleties are the ones that add the most richness to a film's quality. It made me realize that there doesn't have to be things happening every minute in a movie to truly enjoy it. If I were to describe this stylistic aspect of Leone's directing, I would say he is able to inject a feeling of richness in his stories that makes his films feel very warm in tone, all the while being stories with a lot of grit and sharp edges. With 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' this was the first time this specific quality became evident to me in movies. From all the vast landscapes filmed for specific scenes, we feel more like we are delving into a world of beauty that is rarely visited, than watching a mere movie. How Sergio Leone is able to make his films feel larger than life is an astounding achievement and inspiration for those with an artistic vision. And every acting performance is delivered with a sense of sophistication and grace in adding to this rich story. And with every performance, we are presented with characters that are memorable and pivotal to the world they exist in. The world that exists in the film is filled with dirt and grit, and how these characters behave are evident of the world they live in. And this world that we see is the death of the west and the ushering in of a new era. These characters all play a pivotal point in that, but what plays out in the end is a revelation that brings out the full picture of what lurks underneath the motives that fuels each event that occurs, to bring everything full circle. And the way the movie ends on this note is moving. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a dark western filled with a lot of melancholy, but still possessing a quality of rich beauty. Underneath all the scenes of violence, there is an emotionally undercurrent that manages to seep through and how Sergio Leone is able to convey those emotions with so much subtlety shows the true mark of a great director. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a classic not only due to its ambition, but also in how grand it feels in every sense of the word.

    Once Upon A Time In The West is one of the greatest Westerns ever made and a unforgettable,Epic Masterpiece from beginning to end. Filled with powerful direction,great acting,beautiful photography and a brilliant score,Once Upon A Time In The West is not only one of the greatest Westerns of all time,but also one of the greatest films ever made,one of my all-time favorite films and Sergio Leone at his best. Once Upon A Time In The West tells the story of a mysterious stranger named Harmonica(Charles Bronson)who teams up with outlaw Cheyanne(Jason Robards)to protect widow Jill McBain,a former hooker now wife and widow(Claudia Cardinale)from ruthless killer Frank(Henry Fonda)who wants Jill's railroad. Now,Harmonica and Cheyanne must defend and fight for Jill and stop Frank at all costs. Once Upon A Time In The West is a Classic Masterpiece of Cinema that right from the very start has you glued to the screen and give viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that is a large epic not only in scope but in length. Director Sergio Leone gives viewers a different Western than his excellent and Masterful Dollars/Man With No Name Trilogy especially with The Good,The Bad,And The Ugly. I guess that is one of the reasons Once Upon A Time In The West was overlooked when it came out in 1969 because it was a different film than The Man With No Name Trilogy in other words if the Man With No Name Trilogy were Action packed Westerns with big ambitions than Once Upon A Time In The West is a visual Art film Western. Leone takes the epic scope of TG,TB&TU and expands on it with this film giving us a powerful film that has more visuals than dialog and more drama than Action and also pays tribute to the great Western genre taking the trademarks and familiar things that are in a Western film and turning the trademarks on their head and raises the trademarks to a higher level. One of the great things about OUTITW is that this film is more about visuals and tone than it is about dialog because with this film we are shown and given images that are not just there just to be there but add to the story and makes understand what's going on in with the story and the characters who they are and what their motivations are. The images are haunting and at the same time beautiful and add to the films power and greatness. OUATTW doesn't have a lot of dialog but when the dialog is said it is great and memorable making the characters feel gritty and real. It's interesting that OUATTW and Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyseey came out in the same year and while both films are in different genres(Western and Science Fiction)both films are alike in terms of using visuals and little dialog. Leone and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli give OUATTW a beautiful visual style making the West look romantic and epic while at the same time making the film gritty and true to how the old West really was. The style is Spagetti Western but is filmed like a Hollywood Western of the 1940s and 50s All though the film is long(2 Hrs and 45 Minutes)OUATTW moves at a great pace and there is not a wasted scene in the film because OUATTW is one of those films that is so excellent that you want the film to be longer and keep going. The four main characters Jill,Frank,Harmonica and Cheyanne are great characters who represent the classic Western movie standards and arch types(hooker,killer,mysterious gunfighter-gunslinger,outlaw)but the four of them are presented in a larger than life way and are stylized but at the same time feel very real. With the exception of Frank the other main characters Jill,Harmonica and Cheyanne are given a moral ambiguity and have gray areas where you feel sympathy for the three of them and wonder what will happen with the three of them. Although this is not an Action film there are enough Western gunfights to satisfy Western and Action viewers and when the Action happens it is fast and intense. The final 15-20 minutes builds into one of the best endings in film history because it is filled with tension,suspense,surprises and at the same time sad and optimistic. It's an excellent and unforgettable ending you will not forget. The whole cast is great in their roles. Claudia Cardinale is excellent and beautiful as Jill McBain,with Cardinale holding her own against Bronson,Fonda and Robards. Henry Fonda is brilliant and intense as Frank,one of the greatest villains in film history. Fonda is cold and pure evil and you'll never forget his performance. Charles Bronson is wonderful and mysterious as Harmonica,a quiet gunslinger who plays the Harmonica and has great scenes with Cardinale,Fonda and Robards. Jason Robards is great and humorous as Cheyanne,an outlaw that helps out Harmonica and Jill. Gabriele Ferzetti is amazing as Morton,the railroad baron who is also Frank's boss. Frank Wolf(Brett McBain),Lionel Stander(Barman),Paolo Stoppa(Sam)and Keenen Wynn(Sheriif-Auctioneer)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Western favorites like Woody Strode(Stony-Member of Frank's gang)and Jack Elam(Snaky-Member of Frank's gang). The direction by Sergio Leone is excellent,masterful and powerful,with Leone always moving the camera,using great angles and intense close-ups bringing a unique visual style to the film. Great direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is brilliant,beautiful,unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history,with Morricone's score matching the tone and powerful of each scene. A masterful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Westerns or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In The West,a true Masterpiece of the Western genre and a Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    In an age of quick cuts, shaky Camera and CGI, this Film will likely be a hard watch for the post ADD Generation. It is SLOW. The Cinematography lingers. The lines of Dialog are at the most minimum. It is LONG. So why is this considered one of the best Westerns ever. Because it is. An achievement that is a testament to the insatiable Love of Cinema, as Art, that the Europeans unabashedly utilize, like the Hug. They are not shy about physical displays of such Affection. That is the essence of this Film. Leone is a Lover and a Hugger. He is constantly hugging this Movie Loving every minute of it. He Loves the Genre, He Loves the Camera, He loves the Actors Faces, He loves the Landscape, he loves the Mythology, He just Loves and Loves. All that is apparent on the screen. Most likely that is why it is so lengthy. He Loved it all. What emerges is an Authentic Fantasy. There is on display a gorgeousity of grandeur that is quite a sight. Behold its panorama and its larger than Life Characters with their own quirky Personas and accompanying Musical Riffs. This is so playful and fun. It is all done for the Lovers of the World. Mostly, the Lovers of Movies.

    One thing I love about Sergio Leone's style as a director is his execution of telling a story in that while there are moments that have a purpose in progressing in the story, we can appreciate the moments where not much is happening, allowing more room for reflecting, whether it is beauty of the atmosphere in the world these characters live in or how the music is given a chance to evoke the emotions and be its own character. To sum up with more clarity, Sergio Leone made me learn to appreciate films that chooses to take its time, where all the little subtleties are the ones that add the most richness to a film's quality. It made me realize that there doesn't have to be things happening every minute in a movie to truly enjoy it. If I were to describe this stylistic aspect of Leone's directing, I would say he is able to inject a feeling of richness in his stories that makes his films feel very warm in tone, all the while being stories with a lot of grit and sharp edges. With 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' this was the first time this specific quality became evident to me in movies. From all the vast landscapes filmed for specific scenes, we feel more like we are delving into a world of beauty that is rarely visited, than watching a mere movie. How Sergio Leone is able to make his films feel larger than life is an astounding achievement and inspiration for those with an artistic vision. And every acting performance is delivered with a sense of sophistication and grace in adding to this rich story. And with every performance, we are presented with characters that are memorable and pivotal to the world they exist in. The world that exists in the film is filled with dirt and grit, and how these characters behave are evident of the world they live in. And this world that we see is the death of the west and the ushering in of a new era. These characters all play a pivotal point in that, but what plays out in the end is a revelation that brings out the full picture of what lurks underneath the motives that fuels each event that occurs, to bring everything full circle. And the way the movie ends on this note is moving. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a dark western filled with a lot of melancholy, but still possessing a quality of rich beauty. Underneath all the scenes of violence, there is an emotionally undercurrent that manages to seep through and how Sergio Leone is able to convey those emotions with so much subtlety shows the true mark of a great director. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a classic not only due to its ambition, but also in how grand it feels in every sense of the word.

    Sergio Leone's follow up to his superlative "Man With No Name" trilogy is highly acclaimed in some circles, a bit too much so to be honest, but is still a well acted story of a woman(beautiful Claudia Cardinale) who comes to the west as a mail-order-bride, only to find that her would-be family was wiped out by a cold-hearted gunfighter(Henry Fonda, cast effectively against type). She nonetheless vows to carry on, and is later helped by a man known as Harmonica(Charles Bronson) who has also vowed to kill the same man that killed her family. Sprawling story details the westward expansion by train that transformed America irrevocably, ending many ways of life. I did like this film, it is stylish and ambitious, with a good score, but it does become tedious at times, not to mention uncomfortable(Fonda's scenes with Cardinale, for instance...) I just didn't like it anywhere near as much as "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly", but film is still memorable, just not a "classic".

    Once Upon A Time In The West is a quite simply a masterpiece. No film has ever had the same effect on me. I shan't repeat the many eloquent reviews on here which wax lyrically about Leone's beautiful direction, Morricone's sublime score, and the four perfect lead performances.....there would be no point as i agree wholeheartedly. I will instead just list some of the many small moments in this incredible film, moments which make the experience of viewing Leone's epic even greater than the sum of those aforementioned parts: The expression on Henry Fonda's face as he confronts little Timmy McBain, and the sneer in his voice as he tells Morton "People scare better when they're dying!"....has there ever been a more coldblooded villain in movie history? Claudia Cardinale's brown eyes. Charles Bronson and Jason Robards' putdowns. "You know music- and you can count. All the way up to two!" "Do you know a man with a harmonica? He's someone you'd remember. Instead of talking he plays- and when he'd better play, he talks." THAT opening sequence.... THAT shot as Jill arrives at the station, the camera swooping up and over the building to reveal the entire town. And finally, a heartfelt conversation between the film's two most pitiless characters,and bitterest enemies, before their final showdown about how there's no place for their kind anymore in the new civilized America. Leone's previous 3 westerns, particularly his celebrated The Good The Bad & The Ugly, were remarkable movies in their own right. It's a measure of what a triumph Once Upon A Time In The West is that it easily tops them all, along with every other western- yes, even Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch.

    With "Once upon a time in the West" Sergio Leone made an another masterpiece. "Once upon a time in the West" is a movie which has action and is a classic western, it has gunfires and all of that. It's one of the best western movies of all time. This movie has to do with an assassin who wants to kill a widow and from the other hand we have a mysterious and strange man who protects this beautiful widow from the assassin. Claudia Cardinale (Jill McBain - the beautiful widow) makes a great interpretation and she is a pleasant presence who beautifies the movie. Henry Fonda (Frank) and Charles Bronson (Harmonica) made an also good interpretations.

    For me, no other movie has captured the Wild West like Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West. When a mysterious stranger with a harmonica protects a beautiful but naive widow from a ruthless train baron and his hired gun, they all soon discover that much more than prized land is at stake.This is more than a movie, it's an experience in my mind, a piece of history, as the west is portrayed as a haunting brutal land that discriminates against absolutely no-one. From the eerie silent opening to the unimaginable and unforgettable ending, Leone takes you down a path that hasn't been explored in a western before or since. 10 outta 10 guaranteed!!!

    Epic story of a mysterious stranger with a harmonica who joins forces with a notorious desperado to protect a beautiful widow from a ruthless assassin working for the railroad. From Sergio Leone comes another classic Spaghetti Western, that movie is his 1968 masterwork, Once Upon A Time In The West. Once Upon A Time In The West is a classic movie, it is one of Leone's finest works, an it is just as great as, if not better, than "The Man With No Name" Trilogy. This movie is beautifully shot, it's powerfully written, it's powerfully acted, and it's superbly directed. Leone was a genius, he was the master of Spaghetti Westerns, he previously had achieved greatness with his classic trilogy featuring "The Man With No Name," and here, he achieve more greatness, and then he would achieve more greatness with his final movie, his 1984 gangster epic, Once Upon A Time In America. But this movie is wonderful, it's a classic that is one of the best of the Western genre, as well as the Spaghetti Western genre, in short, this movie is pretty perfect. As with many of Leone's other works, Once Upon A Time In The West has a stellar line-up in the casting. Charles Bronson leads the cast as Harmonica, a mysterious harmonica-playing stranger who joins forces with a man named Cheyenne to take out a ruthless assassin. Bronson was known for tough guy roles, and here, he is superb, this is probably his best performance. The always wonderful Jason Robards plays Cheyenne, a bandit who is framed for some murders that he did not commit. Claudia Cardinale is not wasted as Jill McBain, a woman whose family has been murdered and is going along with Cheyenne and Robards to find the killer. Lastly, Henry Fonda is chilling as Frank, one of the greatest movie villains of all time. Fonda was usually known for playing the hero, but here, he played the villain, and he was outstanding in doing so. Along with the acting, we have got a very fine music score from Ennio Morricone, who worked with Leone on many of his films. Many people consider Once Upon A Time In The West to be Leone's finest work. I agree with that, as this movie is outstanding, and it is just as great as, if not better than, "The Man With No Name" trilogy. The movie is nearly three hours long, but it does not seem that long as the film moves quickly with powerful storytelling and wonderful performances. I agree with the critics, Once Upon A Time In The West is a masterpiece of cinema, it defines the meaning of the words, great movies, and it redefines the Western genre as a whole. I send my posthumous applauds to all of those involved, especially to Charles Bronson and Jason Robards. Henry Fonda gets the most applauds, as he was in a class by himself. How he could portray so perfectly a coldblooded killer with absolutely no redeeming features is beyond my imagination. And something else, when he made the movie, Henry Fonda was 63, but he certainly did not appear 63, he appeared much younger. Anyway, Once Upon A Time In The West is better than the hype surrounding it, do not miss the masterpiece. 10/10

    I just got around to viewing this last week on Netflix... Since last weekend I have watched it a further three times and will readily concur with many others on this board that this is my favourite film of all time... It has to be; I've wracked my cranium for the last few days trying to think of another that moved me so profoundly, and nothing comes to mind... The ten minute (or so) gun battle/flashback sequence with Frank and Harmonica had me both crying and goosebump-ridden, Morricone's soaring, amplified guitar playing throughout that sequence left me in such a state of exhilaration that I can't quite express it properly... I found myself having to pull it together to watch the last brilliant 15 or so minutes... Others have described the pace of this film as being "slow"; to those who haven't seen this film, doing confuse this with boring! Like a great book I was sad to see it end, and have returned to it repeatedly over the past few days, appreciating it more every time...

    I personally don't watch a lot of westerns. But if I did, I'm sure this would be one of the top ones. It is slow and intense, the story is thrilling, and you capture the whole feeling of the old American ways. Think younger generations, can't appreciate the movie on a higher level, like the people that were alive when it came out. I'm sure this was what people wanted back then, and the movie delivered. Just like there is a "superhero" era right now, westerns were just as hyped in their own day. This is actually a decent movie, even if you are not fan of the genre. 8 out of 10

    Once Upon A Time In The West is a quite simply a masterpiece. No film has ever had the same effect on me. I shan't repeat the many eloquent reviews on here which wax lyrically about Leone's beautiful direction, Morricone's sublime score, and the four perfect lead performances.....there would be no point as i agree wholeheartedly. I will instead just list some of the many small moments in this incredible film, moments which make the experience of viewing Leone's epic even greater than the sum of those aforementioned parts: The expression on Henry Fonda's face as he confronts little Timmy McBain, and the sneer in his voice as he tells Morton "People scare better when they're dying!"....has there ever been a more coldblooded villain in movie history? Claudia Cardinale's brown eyes. Charles Bronson and Jason Robards' putdowns. "You know music- and you can count. All the way up to two!" "Do you know a man with a harmonica? He's someone you'd remember. Instead of talking he plays- and when he'd better play, he talks." THAT opening sequence.... THAT shot as Jill arrives at the station, the camera swooping up and over the building to reveal the entire town. And finally, a heartfelt conversation between the film's two most pitiless characters,and bitterest enemies, before their final showdown about how there's no place for their kind anymore in the new civilized America. Leone's previous 3 westerns, particularly his celebrated The Good The Bad & The Ugly, were remarkable movies in their own right. It's a measure of what a triumph Once Upon A Time In The West is that it easily tops them all, along with every other western- yes, even Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch.

    With "Once upon a time in the West" Sergio Leone made an another masterpiece. "Once upon a time in the West" is a movie which has action and is a classic western, it has gunfires and all of that. It's one of the best western movies of all time. This movie has to do with an assassin who wants to kill a widow and from the other hand we have a mysterious and strange man who protects this beautiful widow from the assassin. Claudia Cardinale (Jill McBain - the beautiful widow) makes a great interpretation and she is a pleasant presence who beautifies the movie. Henry Fonda (Frank) and Charles Bronson (Harmonica) made an also good interpretations.

    For me, no other movie has captured the Wild West like Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West. When a mysterious stranger with a harmonica protects a beautiful but naive widow from a ruthless train baron and his hired gun, they all soon discover that much more than prized land is at stake.This is more than a movie, it's an experience in my mind, a piece of history, as the west is portrayed as a haunting brutal land that discriminates against absolutely no-one. From the eerie silent opening to the unimaginable and unforgettable ending, Leone takes you down a path that hasn't been explored in a western before or since. 10 outta 10 guaranteed!!!

    Epic story of a mysterious stranger with a harmonica who joins forces with a notorious desperado to protect a beautiful widow from a ruthless assassin working for the railroad. From Sergio Leone comes another classic Spaghetti Western, that movie is his 1968 masterwork, Once Upon A Time In The West. Once Upon A Time In The West is a classic movie, it is one of Leone's finest works, an it is just as great as, if not better, than "The Man With No Name" Trilogy. This movie is beautifully shot, it's powerfully written, it's powerfully acted, and it's superbly directed. Leone was a genius, he was the master of Spaghetti Westerns, he previously had achieved greatness with his classic trilogy featuring "The Man With No Name," and here, he achieve more greatness, and then he would achieve more greatness with his final movie, his 1984 gangster epic, Once Upon A Time In America. But this movie is wonderful, it's a classic that is one of the best of the Western genre, as well as the Spaghetti Western genre, in short, this movie is pretty perfect. As with many of Leone's other works, Once Upon A Time In The West has a stellar line-up in the casting. Charles Bronson leads the cast as Harmonica, a mysterious harmonica-playing stranger who joins forces with a man named Cheyenne to take out a ruthless assassin. Bronson was known for tough guy roles, and here, he is superb, this is probably his best performance. The always wonderful Jason Robards plays Cheyenne, a bandit who is framed for some murders that he did not commit. Claudia Cardinale is not wasted as Jill McBain, a woman whose family has been murdered and is going along with Cheyenne and Robards to find the killer. Lastly, Henry Fonda is chilling as Frank, one of the greatest movie villains of all time. Fonda was usually known for playing the hero, but here, he played the villain, and he was outstanding in doing so. Along with the acting, we have got a very fine music score from Ennio Morricone, who worked with Leone on many of his films. Many people consider Once Upon A Time In The West to be Leone's finest work. I agree with that, as this movie is outstanding, and it is just as great as, if not better than, "The Man With No Name" trilogy. The movie is nearly three hours long, but it does not seem that long as the film moves quickly with powerful storytelling and wonderful performances. I agree with the critics, Once Upon A Time In The West is a masterpiece of cinema, it defines the meaning of the words, great movies, and it redefines the Western genre as a whole. I send my posthumous applauds to all of those involved, especially to Charles Bronson and Jason Robards. Henry Fonda gets the most applauds, as he was in a class by himself. How he could portray so perfectly a coldblooded killer with absolutely no redeeming features is beyond my imagination. And something else, when he made the movie, Henry Fonda was 63, but he certainly did not appear 63, he appeared much younger. Anyway, Once Upon A Time In The West is better than the hype surrounding it, do not miss the masterpiece. 10/10

    I just got around to viewing this last week on Netflix... Since last weekend I have watched it a further three times and will readily concur with many others on this board that this is my favourite film of all time... It has to be; I've wracked my cranium for the last few days trying to think of another that moved me so profoundly, and nothing comes to mind... The ten minute (or so) gun battle/flashback sequence with Frank and Harmonica had me both crying and goosebump-ridden, Morricone's soaring, amplified guitar playing throughout that sequence left me in such a state of exhilaration that I can't quite express it properly... I found myself having to pull it together to watch the last brilliant 15 or so minutes... Others have described the pace of this film as being "slow"; to those who haven't seen this film, doing confuse this with boring! Like a great book I was sad to see it end, and have returned to it repeatedly over the past few days, appreciating it more every time...

    I personally don't watch a lot of westerns. But if I did, I'm sure this would be one of the top ones. It is slow and intense, the story is thrilling, and you capture the whole feeling of the old American ways. Think younger generations, can't appreciate the movie on a higher level, like the people that were alive when it came out. I'm sure this was what people wanted back then, and the movie delivered. Just like there is a "superhero" era right now, westerns were just as hyped in their own day. This is actually a decent movie, even if you are not fan of the genre. 8 out of 10

    One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. A Brilliant,Powerful,Unforgettable Epic Masterpiece From Sergio Leone.

    Once Upon A Time In The West is one of the greatest Westerns ever made and a unforgettable,Epic Masterpiece from beginning to end. Filled with powerful direction,great acting,beautiful photography and a brilliant score,Once Upon A Time In The West is not only one of the greatest Westerns of all time,but also one of the greatest films ever made,one of my all-time favorite films and Sergio Leone at his best. Once Upon A Time In The West tells the story of a mysterious stranger named Harmonica(Charles Bronson)who teams up with outlaw Cheyanne(Jason Robards)to protect widow Jill McBain,a former hooker now wife and widow(Claudia Cardinale)from ruthless killer Frank(Henry Fonda)who wants Jill's railroad. Now,Harmonica and Cheyanne must defend and fight for Jill and stop Frank at all costs. Once Upon A Time In The West is a Classic Masterpiece of Cinema that right from the very start has you glued to the screen and give viewers an unforgettable cinematic experience that is a large epic not only in scope but in length. Director Sergio Leone gives viewers a different Western than his excellent and Masterful Dollars/Man With No Name Trilogy especially with The Good,The Bad,And The Ugly. I guess that is one of the reasons Once Upon A Time In The West was overlooked when it came out in 1969 because it was a different film than The Man With No Name Trilogy in other words if the Man With No Name Trilogy were Action packed Westerns with big ambitions than Once Upon A Time In The West is a visual Art film Western. Leone takes the epic scope of TG,TB&TU and expands on it with this film giving us a powerful film that has more visuals than dialog and more drama than Action and also pays tribute to the great Western genre taking the trademarks and familiar things that are in a Western film and turning the trademarks on their head and raises the trademarks to a higher level. One of the great things about OUTITW is that this film is more about visuals and tone than it is about dialog because with this film we are shown and given images that are not just there just to be there but add to the story and makes understand what's going on in with the story and the characters who they are and what their motivations are. The images are haunting and at the same time beautiful and add to the films power and greatness. OUATTW doesn't have a lot of dialog but when the dialog is said it is great and memorable making the characters feel gritty and real. It's interesting that OUATTW and Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyseey came out in the same year and while both films are in different genres(Western and Science Fiction)both films are alike in terms of using visuals and little dialog. Leone and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli give OUATTW a beautiful visual style making the West look romantic and epic while at the same time making the film gritty and true to how the old West really was. The style is Spagetti Western but is filmed like a Hollywood Western of the 1940s and 50s All though the film is long(2 Hrs and 45 Minutes)OUATTW moves at a great pace and there is not a wasted scene in the film because OUATTW is one of those films that is so excellent that you want the film to be longer and keep going. The four main characters Jill,Frank,Harmonica and Cheyanne are great characters who represent the classic Western movie standards and arch types(hooker,killer,mysterious gunfighter-gunslinger,outlaw)but the four of them are presented in a larger than life way and are stylized but at the same time feel very real. With the exception of Frank the other main characters Jill,Harmonica and Cheyanne are given a moral ambiguity and have gray areas where you feel sympathy for the three of them and wonder what will happen with the three of them. Although this is not an Action film there are enough Western gunfights to satisfy Western and Action viewers and when the Action happens it is fast and intense. The final 15-20 minutes builds into one of the best endings in film history because it is filled with tension,suspense,surprises and at the same time sad and optimistic. It's an excellent and unforgettable ending you will not forget. The whole cast is great in their roles. Claudia Cardinale is excellent and beautiful as Jill McBain,with Cardinale holding her own against Bronson,Fonda and Robards. Henry Fonda is brilliant and intense as Frank,one of the greatest villains in film history. Fonda is cold and pure evil and you'll never forget his performance. Charles Bronson is wonderful and mysterious as Harmonica,a quiet gunslinger who plays the Harmonica and has great scenes with Cardinale,Fonda and Robards. Jason Robards is great and humorous as Cheyanne,an outlaw that helps out Harmonica and Jill. Gabriele Ferzetti is amazing as Morton,the railroad baron who is also Frank's boss. Frank Wolf(Brett McBain),Lionel Stander(Barman),Paolo Stoppa(Sam)and Keenen Wynn(Sheriif-Auctioneer)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Western favorites like Woody Strode(Stony-Member of Frank's gang)and Jack Elam(Snaky-Member of Frank's gang). The direction by Sergio Leone is excellent,masterful and powerful,with Leone always moving the camera,using great angles and intense close-ups bringing a unique visual style to the film. Great direction,Leone. The score by Ennio Morricone is brilliant,beautiful,unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history,with Morricone's score matching the tone and powerful of each scene. A masterful score by Morricone. In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Westerns or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In The West,a true Masterpiece of the Western genre and a Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    In an age of quick cuts, shaky Camera and CGI, this Film will likely be a hard watch for the post ADD Generation. It is SLOW. The Cinematography lingers. The lines of Dialog are at the most minimum. It is LONG. So why is this considered one of the best Westerns ever. Because it is. An achievement that is a testament to the insatiable Love of Cinema, as Art, that the Europeans unabashedly utilize, like the Hug. They are not shy about physical displays of such Affection. That is the essence of this Film. Leone is a Lover and a Hugger. He is constantly hugging this Movie Loving every minute of it. He Loves the Genre, He Loves the Camera, He loves the Actors Faces, He loves the Landscape, he loves the Mythology, He just Loves and Loves. All that is apparent on the screen. Most likely that is why it is so lengthy. He Loved it all. What emerges is an Authentic Fantasy. There is on display a gorgeousity of grandeur that is quite a sight. Behold its panorama and its larger than Life Characters with their own quirky Personas and accompanying Musical Riffs. This is so playful and fun. It is all done for the Lovers of the World. Mostly, the Lovers of Movies.

    One thing I love about Sergio Leone's style as a director is his execution of telling a story in that while there are moments that have a purpose in progressing in the story, we can appreciate the moments where not much is happening, allowing more room for reflecting, whether it is beauty of the atmosphere in the world these characters live in or how the music is given a chance to evoke the emotions and be its own character. To sum up with more clarity, Sergio Leone made me learn to appreciate films that chooses to take its time, where all the little subtleties are the ones that add the most richness to a film's quality. It made me realize that there doesn't have to be things happening every minute in a movie to truly enjoy it. If I were to describe this stylistic aspect of Leone's directing, I would say he is able to inject a feeling of richness in his stories that makes his films feel very warm in tone, all the while being stories with a lot of grit and sharp edges. With 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' this was the first time this specific quality became evident to me in movies. From all the vast landscapes filmed for specific scenes, we feel more like we are delving into a world of beauty that is rarely visited, than watching a mere movie. How Sergio Leone is able to make his films feel larger than life is an astounding achievement and inspiration for those with an artistic vision. And every acting performance is delivered with a sense of sophistication and grace in adding to this rich story. And with every performance, we are presented with characters that are memorable and pivotal to the world they exist in. The world that exists in the film is filled with dirt and grit, and how these characters behave are evident of the world they live in. And this world that we see is the death of the west and the ushering in of a new era. These characters all play a pivotal point in that, but what plays out in the end is a revelation that brings out the full picture of what lurks underneath the motives that fuels each event that occurs, to bring everything full circle. And the way the movie ends on this note is moving. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a dark western filled with a lot of melancholy, but still possessing a quality of rich beauty. Underneath all the scenes of violence, there is an emotionally undercurrent that manages to seep through and how Sergio Leone is able to convey those emotions with so much subtlety shows the true mark of a great director. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a classic not only due to its ambition, but also in how grand it feels in every sense of the word.
