    Keaneu Reeves plays Officer Jack Traven, who, along with his partner Harry(Jeff Daniels) stop a bomber's plan to destroy an elevator full of people to receive a ransom. Unfortunately, the bomber( played enthusiastically by Dennis Hopper) survived, and engages his back-up plan: To strap a bomb on a city bus, and tell Jack that if it goes below 50 miles an hour, it will blow up. So Jack must hop on the moving bus, and find a way to get the passengers off safely before the bus is blown up... Exciting, extremely well-directed(Jan De Bont) and sharply written action film hits a Bullseye, thanks to a breathless pace, and a most appealing cast of characters, especially Sandra Bullock as Annie Porter, who became a star with her winning performance. Will resonate more with people who have had to ever take a city bus!

    Hard to believe it's nearing 20 years since they released Speed. And it, pretty much, still holds up today. This was just one of the long lines of very good to great movies that starred and was certainly not helped by: Keanu Reeves. At the time, he was the luckiest man in Hollywood, from Bram Stoker's Dracula to Speed to The Matrix. He got to be in the cream of the crop without having to show any depth or acting ability. Perhaps, that's what director Jan de Bont was looking for here: a soulless and cardboard cop and well, there you go. Actually, the real star here was Sandra Bullock and this was her break-through role. She stole every scene, had the best lines and timing and looked stunning. Hell, even Dennis Hopper's juicy and fun Howard "anything but a" Payne was no match for Bullock. So, if you forget the forgettable Jeff Daniels and Joe Morton and, naturally, whiteout Reeves, the true stars were Bullock and Hopper. They were so good, that even with the great amount of enormously enjoyable action, it's worth seeing just for them two. Speed focuses on disgruntled Payne and when his terrorist plot of bombing an elevator  too bad he didn't pick the one from the terrible Devil movie  is thwarted by the cops (Reeves's Jack Traven and Daniels's Harry Temple,) Payne shifts to road wars. He rigs a bus that, once it hits 50 mph, it will explode if it slows below 50 mph. Luckily, for everyone on this LA bus, when the bus does hit 50 mph, it's navigated by shrewd, albeit rightfully scared, passenger Annie Porter and Traven, who happened to "catch the bus." There are rules, of course  this is a 90s terrorist action flick, duh. No one can get off the bus, and Payne wants money for an undisclosed and anti-spoiler reason, or he'll blow the bus. Annie must pilot this bus through the already terrible LA traffic while the stiff, er, Jack figures out what to do. Since the years, and now almost decades, since this came out, this movie's been dissected enough. Sure, there are huge plot holes, some even big enough to drive (or leap) said bus through  even at 50 mph, but if you sit back, leave your brain at the door, you can enjoy the ride. It's campy 90s action fare, and for those of us who loved it back then and still do, this is the movie for us. I will say, I do have one huge problem with this. Okay, maybe not the original, but the sequel. STAY AWAY FROM (anything but) Speed 2: Cruise Control. That movie was a tragedy from beginning to end. And this kind of movie did NOT need a sequel. It was great as it was. Just have fun here and don't take the next bus.

    A psychopathic bomber (Dennis Hopper) is extorting the city. He has rigged an elevator full of people to plummet. Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) is a brash young police officer. Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) is his steady partner. Together the two officers foil the bomber's plan in a nick of time. Then the bomber blows up a bus, and tells Traven that he will blow another one. Once that bus hits 50 mph, the bomb will arm and explode if it slows below 50. When the driver got shot, Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) had to take over the driving. The premise is simple to understand. It's visceral and easy. But it's all about the fun dialog. It is no surprise that Joss Whedon wrote all the dialog. It's snappy and fun. Sandra Bullock is the perfect conduit to put all those exchanges. At the start, Jeff Daniels and Keanu Reeves have that great chemistry. Then they switch it to Sandra. The writing really puts it over the top of just another good action thriller.

    This film was fantastic. One, because it gave me all these emotions while I was watching it. I was happy, scared, Frustrated, confused and etc. It felt like I was a passenger on the bus too. Two, because the actors were extremely good, they exaggerated and really suited the film. I also believe its Keanu Reeves best film he has ever acted in. and three, because the start of the film, and how they introduced it made me wonder what will happen next.It made me focus a lot more than I usually do when watching a film also, this was because the introduction seemed intense.

    Greetings from Lithuania. "Speed" is a real action classic. Everything in this movie works. Action sequences are great, effects top notch even in this time, chemistry between actor is solid, script is great for this kind of movie. This movie grabs you from the opening titles till the very last end - and you can count these kind of movies on one hand. Keanu Reeves is brilliant straightforward action hero in "Speed". Sandra Bullock is great also. This is an action film for the ages - it's doesn't get old. This is one of my favorite action films of all time. If you still haven't see it (i hardly imagine that this possible) - do as fast as you can.

    A great, thriller movie for 13+ older. Contains tons of suspense and thrills. What else can I say about this awesome movie? Oh yeah. It made me have a faster heart beat than usual. I also think the performance of the actors were perfect. They showed the emotions very well. I also have to admit though, that Dennis Hopper's performance was bit off when it came to his evil schemes. Here's some of the obstacles they had to get through: made a successful jump through a 50 feet ramp, went through the city, nearly hit pedestrians, trying to get Sam (the bus driver) off after being shot in the back, a fuel leakage, racing through the airport, trying to disable the bomb underneath the bus and unloading passengers off the bus while in motion. I give this movie a 10/10 for its thrills and suspense.

    Speed stars two of my screen favourites, Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, and perhaps for that reason it's a super sexy exhilarating ride. It is one of those movies I can re-watch quite frequently. I'd say I dig it out at least every 6 months or so. And I love it every time! I love Keanu's character - can we say SEXXXXY? - and Sandra's is entertaining as well. Annie really steps up to the plate when a very scary situation calls for it. This movie is action-packed, and has sad as well as exciting moments. I never cease to get really sad at one particular scene that I won't mention 'cause, you know, that'd be a spoiler. All in all, yep, this is still a favourite and never gets old!

    - A- This is a very good action film that has enough action to out best many films of its type. Sandra Bullock is very good as the driver and Keanu Reeves as the cop and Dennis Hopper as the villain. I'm not a huge Keanu Reeves fan, but really liked him in this film. The characters on the bus are good and the cops are fun too. The action is big, explosive, and a lot of fun. The script is a lot of fun even though there is a ton of cursing in it. The ending is good and one that will inspire sequels, but it'll be tough for them to live up to this one. Great fun.

    This is a dumb but exhilarating and entertaining movie. Although some parts of the movie doesn't make much sense. It's still one of the good action movies from the 90's. I can see where Hideo Kojima got some of his ideas from for his "Metal Gear Solid" game and some of those ideas probably came from watching this movie. It's a cool movie with a cool and charismatic protagonist played by Keanu Reeves who plays Officer Jack Traven. Who will do everything he can to save innocent lives from the clutches of the bad guy. But yeah, the plot is basically about a old guy wanting 3.7 million dollars by taking people hostage. And he goes about it in a dumb manner for a guy that is suppose to be intelligent. And that villain is played by Dennis Hopper who is actually good as the villain in this movie but plays a character that basically asks the good guys to beat him. Anyways after his first scheme he decides to rig a bus with passengers with a bomb and the bus has to go over 50 miles an hour for it not to blow up with innocent lives. And it's up to Officer Jack Traven and the police force to stop the guy. Overall this is a good solid fun popcorn flick from the 90's. Even the beginning credit scene I usually want to skip through I enjoyed because of this movie's theme music, which is also cool and memorable. And sounds similar to one of the songs in "Metal Gear Solid". 8/10

    If you take John McClane and put him on bus, you get Speed, and like Die Hard there's action, Comedy moments, one liners, more action, and a fantastic script. Officer Jack Travis (Keanu Reeves), off the back of winning a medal along with his partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) for foiling a terrorist attack on a hotel, assumes that terrorist is dead having heard the bomb explode, only for him to be alive and already have his next target, a downtown bus filled with passengers. The reason: he wants $3million, The catch: if the bus goes below 50mph the bomb will explode and if anyone gets off the bus the bomb explodes, leaving it up to Jack to try and save the day by racing after the bus and getting on it and somehow hoping it doesn't run out of road or gas. its tense and exciting with thrilling moments, particularly a scene in which the speeding bus must jump and near 50 foot gap in an unfinished bridge. Even for a movie with such a clever script there is plenty of time for fantastic action sequences and will probably leave you disappointed that the movie isn't longer With an all star cast including: Sandra Bullock, Joe Morton, and Dennis Hopper, along with a twist about the villain and some clever writing, Speed puts you right in the passenger seat in a fantastic action movie that has its sad and romantic moments. Speed will end up making you hope you don't run in to many red lights or traffic on your way to work. Best Quote: Harry:"You shot me, I can't believe it. They're giving you a medal for shooting me, you little prick" If you enjoyed watching:....Die Hard, Eagle Eye....you'll enjoy watching Speed.

    Hard to believe it's nearing 20 years since they released Speed. And it, pretty much, still holds up today. This was just one of the long lines of very good to great movies that starred and was certainly not helped by: Keanu Reeves. At the time, he was the luckiest man in Hollywood, from Bram Stoker's Dracula to Speed to The Matrix. He got to be in the cream of the crop without having to show any depth or acting ability. Perhaps, that's what director Jan de Bont was looking for here: a soulless and cardboard cop and well, there you go. Actually, the real star here was Sandra Bullock and this was her break-through role. She stole every scene, had the best lines and timing and looked stunning. Hell, even Dennis Hopper's juicy and fun Howard "anything but a" Payne was no match for Bullock. So, if you forget the forgettable Jeff Daniels and Joe Morton and, naturally, whiteout Reeves, the true stars were Bullock and Hopper. They were so good, that even with the great amount of enormously enjoyable action, it's worth seeing just for them two. Speed focuses on disgruntled Payne and when his terrorist plot of bombing an elevator  too bad he didn't pick the one from the terrible Devil movie  is thwarted by the cops (Reeves's Jack Traven and Daniels's Harry Temple,) Payne shifts to road wars. He rigs a bus that, once it hits 50 mph, it will explode if it slows below 50 mph. Luckily, for everyone on this LA bus, when the bus does hit 50 mph, it's navigated by shrewd, albeit rightfully scared, passenger Annie Porter and Traven, who happened to "catch the bus." There are rules, of course  this is a 90s terrorist action flick, duh. No one can get off the bus, and Payne wants money for an undisclosed and anti-spoiler reason, or he'll blow the bus. Annie must pilot this bus through the already terrible LA traffic while the stiff, er, Jack figures out what to do. Since the years, and now almost decades, since this came out, this movie's been dissected enough. Sure, there are huge plot holes, some even big enough to drive (or leap) said bus through  even at 50 mph, but if you sit back, leave your brain at the door, you can enjoy the ride. It's campy 90s action fare, and for those of us who loved it back then and still do, this is the movie for us. I will say, I do have one huge problem with this. Okay, maybe not the original, but the sequel. STAY AWAY FROM (anything but) Speed 2: Cruise Control. That movie was a tragedy from beginning to end. And this kind of movie did NOT need a sequel. It was great as it was. Just have fun here and don't take the next bus.

    A psychopathic bomber (Dennis Hopper) is extorting the city. He has rigged an elevator full of people to plummet. Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) is a brash young police officer. Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) is his steady partner. Together the two officers foil the bomber's plan in a nick of time. Then the bomber blows up a bus, and tells Traven that he will blow another one. Once that bus hits 50 mph, the bomb will arm and explode if it slows below 50. When the driver got shot, Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) had to take over the driving. The premise is simple to understand. It's visceral and easy. But it's all about the fun dialog. It is no surprise that Joss Whedon wrote all the dialog. It's snappy and fun. Sandra Bullock is the perfect conduit to put all those exchanges. At the start, Jeff Daniels and Keanu Reeves have that great chemistry. Then they switch it to Sandra. The writing really puts it over the top of just another good action thriller.

    This film was fantastic. One, because it gave me all these emotions while I was watching it. I was happy, scared, Frustrated, confused and etc. It felt like I was a passenger on the bus too. Two, because the actors were extremely good, they exaggerated and really suited the film. I also believe its Keanu Reeves best film he has ever acted in. and three, because the start of the film, and how they introduced it made me wonder what will happen next.It made me focus a lot more than I usually do when watching a film also, this was because the introduction seemed intense.

    Greetings from Lithuania. "Speed" is a real action classic. Everything in this movie works. Action sequences are great, effects top notch even in this time, chemistry between actor is solid, script is great for this kind of movie. This movie grabs you from the opening titles till the very last end - and you can count these kind of movies on one hand. Keanu Reeves is brilliant straightforward action hero in "Speed". Sandra Bullock is great also. This is an action film for the ages - it's doesn't get old. This is one of my favorite action films of all time. If you still haven't see it (i hardly imagine that this possible) - do as fast as you can.

    A great, thriller movie for 13+ older. Contains tons of suspense and thrills. What else can I say about this awesome movie? Oh yeah. It made me have a faster heart beat than usual. I also think the performance of the actors were perfect. They showed the emotions very well. I also have to admit though, that Dennis Hopper's performance was bit off when it came to his evil schemes. Here's some of the obstacles they had to get through: made a successful jump through a 50 feet ramp, went through the city, nearly hit pedestrians, trying to get Sam (the bus driver) off after being shot in the back, a fuel leakage, racing through the airport, trying to disable the bomb underneath the bus and unloading passengers off the bus while in motion. I give this movie a 10/10 for its thrills and suspense.

    Speed stars two of my screen favourites, Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, and perhaps for that reason it's a super sexy exhilarating ride. It is one of those movies I can re-watch quite frequently. I'd say I dig it out at least every 6 months or so. And I love it every time! I love Keanu's character - can we say SEXXXXY? - and Sandra's is entertaining as well. Annie really steps up to the plate when a very scary situation calls for it. This movie is action-packed, and has sad as well as exciting moments. I never cease to get really sad at one particular scene that I won't mention 'cause, you know, that'd be a spoiler. All in all, yep, this is still a favourite and never gets old!

    - A- This is a very good action film that has enough action to out best many films of its type. Sandra Bullock is very good as the driver and Keanu Reeves as the cop and Dennis Hopper as the villain. I'm not a huge Keanu Reeves fan, but really liked him in this film. The characters on the bus are good and the cops are fun too. The action is big, explosive, and a lot of fun. The script is a lot of fun even though there is a ton of cursing in it. The ending is good and one that will inspire sequels, but it'll be tough for them to live up to this one. Great fun.

    This is a dumb but exhilarating and entertaining movie. Although some parts of the movie doesn't make much sense. It's still one of the good action movies from the 90's. I can see where Hideo Kojima got some of his ideas from for his "Metal Gear Solid" game and some of those ideas probably came from watching this movie. It's a cool movie with a cool and charismatic protagonist played by Keanu Reeves who plays Officer Jack Traven. Who will do everything he can to save innocent lives from the clutches of the bad guy. But yeah, the plot is basically about a old guy wanting 3.7 million dollars by taking people hostage. And he goes about it in a dumb manner for a guy that is suppose to be intelligent. And that villain is played by Dennis Hopper who is actually good as the villain in this movie but plays a character that basically asks the good guys to beat him. Anyways after his first scheme he decides to rig a bus with passengers with a bomb and the bus has to go over 50 miles an hour for it not to blow up with innocent lives. And it's up to Officer Jack Traven and the police force to stop the guy. Overall this is a good solid fun popcorn flick from the 90's. Even the beginning credit scene I usually want to skip through I enjoyed because of this movie's theme music, which is also cool and memorable. And sounds similar to one of the songs in "Metal Gear Solid". 8/10

    If you take John McClane and put him on bus, you get Speed, and like Die Hard there's action, Comedy moments, one liners, more action, and a fantastic script. Officer Jack Travis (Keanu Reeves), off the back of winning a medal along with his partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) for foiling a terrorist attack on a hotel, assumes that terrorist is dead having heard the bomb explode, only for him to be alive and already have his next target, a downtown bus filled with passengers. The reason: he wants $3million, The catch: if the bus goes below 50mph the bomb will explode and if anyone gets off the bus the bomb explodes, leaving it up to Jack to try and save the day by racing after the bus and getting on it and somehow hoping it doesn't run out of road or gas. its tense and exciting with thrilling moments, particularly a scene in which the speeding bus must jump and near 50 foot gap in an unfinished bridge. Even for a movie with such a clever script there is plenty of time for fantastic action sequences and will probably leave you disappointed that the movie isn't longer With an all star cast including: Sandra Bullock, Joe Morton, and Dennis Hopper, along with a twist about the villain and some clever writing, Speed puts you right in the passenger seat in a fantastic action movie that has its sad and romantic moments. Speed will end up making you hope you don't run in to many red lights or traffic on your way to work. Best Quote: Harry:"You shot me, I can't believe it. They're giving you a medal for shooting me, you little prick" If you enjoyed watching:....Die Hard, Eagle Eye....you'll enjoy watching Speed.

    Keaneu Reeves plays Officer Jack Traven, who, along with his partner Harry(Jeff Daniels) stop a bomber's plan to destroy an elevator full of people to receive a ransom. Unfortunately, the bomber( played enthusiastically by Dennis Hopper) survived, and engages his back-up plan: To strap a bomb on a city bus, and tell Jack that if it goes below 50 miles an hour, it will blow up. So Jack must hop on the moving bus, and find a way to get the passengers off safely before the bus is blown up... Exciting, extremely well-directed(Jan De Bont) and sharply written action film hits a Bullseye, thanks to a breathless pace, and a most appealing cast of characters, especially Sandra Bullock as Annie Porter, who became a star with her winning performance. Will resonate more with people who have had to ever take a city bus!

Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) is his steady partner. Together the two officers foil the bomber's plan in a nick of time. Then the bomber blows up a bus, and tells Traven that he will blow another one. Once that bus hits 50 mph, the bomb will arm and explode if it slows below 50. When the driver got shot, Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) had to take over the driving. The premise is simple to understand. It's visceral and easy. But it's all about the fun dialog. It is no surprise that Joss Whedon wrote all the dialog. It's snappy and fun. Sandra Bullock is the perfect conduit to put all those exchanges. At the start, Jeff Daniels and Keanu Reeves have that great chemistry. Then they switch it to Sandra. The writing really puts it over the top of just another good action thriller.

    This film was fantastic. One, because it gave me all these emotions while I was watching it. I was happy, scared, Frustrated, confused and etc. It felt like I was a passenger on the bus too. Two, because the actors were extremely good, they exaggerated and really suited the film. I also believe its Keanu Reeves best film he has ever acted in. and three, because the start of the film, and how they introduced it made me wonder what will happen next.It made me focus a lot more than I usually do when watching a film also, this was because the introduction seemed intense.

    Greetings from Lithuania. "Speed" is a real action classic. Everything in this movie works. Action sequences are great, effects top notch even in this time, chemistry between actor is solid, script is great for this kind of movie. This movie grabs you from the opening titles till the very last end - and you can count these kind of movies on one hand. Keanu Reeves is brilliant straightforward action hero in "Speed". Sandra Bullock is great also. This is an action film for the ages - it's doesn't get old. This is one of my favorite action films of all time. If you still haven't see it (i hardly imagine that this possible) - do as fast as you can.

    A great, thriller movie for 13+ older. Contains tons of suspense and thrills. What else can I say about this awesome movie? Oh yeah. It made me have a faster heart beat than usual. I also think the performance of the actors were perfect. They showed the emotions very well. I also have to admit though, that Dennis Hopper's performance was bit off when it came to his evil schemes. Here's some of the obstacles they had to get through: made a successful jump through a 50 feet ramp, went through the city, nearly hit pedestrians, trying to get Sam (the bus driver) off after being shot in the back, a fuel leakage, racing through the airport, trying to disable the bomb underneath the bus and unloading passengers off the bus while in motion. I give this movie a 10/10 for its thrills and suspense.

    Speed stars two of my screen favourites, Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, and perhaps for that reason it's a super sexy exhilarating ride. It is one of those movies I can re-watch quite frequently. I'd say I dig it out at least every 6 months or so. And I love it every time! I love Keanu's character - can we say SEXXXXY? - and Sandra's is entertaining as well. Annie really steps up to the plate when a very scary situation calls for it. This movie is action-packed, and has sad as well as exciting moments. I never cease to get really sad at one particular scene that I won't mention 'cause, you know, that'd be a spoiler. All in all, yep, this is still a favourite and never gets old!

    - A- This is a very good action film that has enough action to out best many films of its type. Sandra Bullock is very good as the driver and Keanu Reeves as the cop and Dennis Hopper as the villain. I'm not a huge Keanu Reeves fan, but really liked him in this film. The characters on the bus are good and the cops are fun too. The action is big, explosive, and a lot of fun. The script is a lot of fun even though there is a ton of cursing in it. The ending is good and one that will inspire sequels, but it'll be tough for them to live up to this one. Great fun.

    This is a dumb but exhilarating and entertaining movie. Although some parts of the movie doesn't make much sense. It's still one of the good action movies from the 90's. I can see where Hideo Kojima got some of his ideas from for his "Metal Gear Solid" game and some of those ideas probably came from watching this movie. It's a cool movie with a cool and charismatic protagonist played by Keanu Reeves who plays Officer Jack Traven. Who will do everything he can to save innocent lives from the clutches of the bad guy. But yeah, the plot is basically about a old guy wanting 3.7 million dollars by taking people hostage. And he goes about it in a dumb manner for a guy that is suppose to be intelligent. And that villain is played by Dennis Hopper who is actually good as the villain in this movie but plays a character that basically asks the good guys to beat him. Anyways after his first scheme he decides to rig a bus with passengers with a bomb and the bus has to go over 50 miles an hour for it not to blow up with innocent lives. And it's up to Officer Jack Traven and the police force to stop the guy. Overall this is a good solid fun popcorn flick from the 90's. Even the beginning credit scene I usually want to skip through I enjoyed because of this movie's theme music, which is also cool and memorable. And sounds similar to one of the songs in "Metal Gear Solid". 8/10

    If you take John McClane and put him on bus, you get Speed, and like Die Hard there's action, Comedy moments, one liners, more action, and a fantastic script. Officer Jack Travis (Keanu Reeves), off the back of winning a medal along with his partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) for foiling a terrorist attack on a hotel, assumes that terrorist is dead having heard the bomb explode, only for him to be alive and already have his next target, a downtown bus filled with passengers. The reason: he wants $3million, The catch: if the bus goes below 50mph the bomb will explode and if anyone gets off the bus the bomb explodes, leaving it up to Jack to try and save the day by racing after the bus and getting on it and somehow hoping it doesn't run out of road or gas. its tense and exciting with thrilling moments, particularly a scene in which the speeding bus must jump and near 50 foot gap in an unfinished bridge. Even for a movie with such a clever script there is plenty of time for fantastic action sequences and will probably leave you disappointed that the movie isn't longer With an all star cast including: Sandra Bullock, Joe Morton, and Dennis Hopper, along with a twist about the villain and some clever writing, Speed puts you right in the passenger seat in a fantastic action movie that has its sad and romantic moments. Speed will end up making you hope you don't run in to many red lights or traffic on your way to work. Best Quote: Harry:"You shot me, I can't believe it. They're giving you a medal for shooting me, you little prick" If you enjoyed watching:....Die Hard, Eagle Eye....you'll enjoy watching Speed.

    Keaneu Reeves plays Officer Jack Traven, who, along with his partner Harry(Jeff Daniels) stop a bomber's plan to destroy an elevator full of people to receive a ransom. Unfortunately, the bomber( played enthusiastically by Dennis Hopper) survived, and engages his back-up plan: To strap a bomb on a city bus, and tell Jack that if it goes below 50 miles an hour, it will blow up. So Jack must hop on the moving bus, and find a way to get the passengers off safely before the bus is blown up... Exciting, extremely well-directed(Jan De Bont) and sharply written action film hits a Bullseye, thanks to a breathless pace, and a most appealing cast of characters, especially Sandra Bullock as Annie Porter, who became a star with her winning performance. Will resonate more with people who have had to ever take a city bus!

    Hard to believe it's nearing 20 years since they released Speed. And it, pretty much, still holds up today. This was just one of the long lines of very good to great movies that starred and was certainly not helped by: Keanu Reeves. At the time, he was the luckiest man in Hollywood, from Bram Stoker's Dracula to Speed to The Matrix. He got to be in the cream of the crop without having to show any depth or acting ability. Perhaps, that's what director Jan de Bont was looking for here: a soulless and cardboard cop and well, there you go. Actually, the real star here was Sandra Bullock and this was her break-through role. She stole every scene, had the best lines and timing and looked stunning. Hell, even Dennis Hopper's juicy and fun Howard "anything but a" Payne was no match for Bullock. So, if you forget the forgettable Jeff Daniels and Joe Morton and, naturally, whiteout Reeves, the true stars were Bullock and Hopper. They were so good, that even with the great amount of enormously enjoyable action, it's worth seeing just for them two. Speed focuses on disgruntled Payne and when his terrorist plot of bombing an elevator  too bad he didn't pick the one from the terrible Devil movie  is thwarted by the cops (Reeves's Jack Traven and Daniels's Harry Temple,) Payne shifts to road wars. He rigs a bus that, once it hits 50 mph, it will explode if it slows below 50 mph. Luckily, for everyone on this LA bus, when the bus does hit 50 mph, it's navigated by shrewd, albeit rightfully scared, passenger Annie Porter and Traven, who happened to "catch the bus." There are rules, of course  this is a 90s terrorist action flick, duh. No one can get off the bus, and Payne wants money for an undisclosed and anti-spoiler reason, or he'll blow the bus. Annie must pilot this bus through the already terrible LA traffic while the stiff, er, Jack figures out what to do. Since the years, and now almost decades, since this came out, this movie's been dissected enough. Sure, there are huge plot holes, some even big enough to drive (or leap) said bus through  even at 50 mph, but if you sit back, leave your brain at the door, you can enjoy the ride. It's campy 90s action fare, and for those of us who loved it back then and still do, this is the movie for us. I will say, I do have one huge problem with this. Okay, maybe not the original, but the sequel. STAY AWAY FROM (anything but) Speed 2: Cruise Control. That movie was a tragedy from beginning to end. And this kind of movie did NOT need a sequel. It was great as it was. Just have fun here and don't take the next bus.

I also think the performance of the actors were perfect. They showed the emotions very well. I also have to admit though, that Dennis Hopper's performance was bit off when it came to his evil schemes. Here's some of the obstacles they had to get through: made a successful jump through a 50 feet ramp, went through the city, nearly hit pedestrians, trying to get Sam (the bus driver) off after being shot in the back, a fuel leakage, racing through the airport, trying to disable the bomb underneath the bus and unloading passengers off the bus while in motion. I give this movie a 10/10 for its thrills and suspense.

    Speed stars two of my screen favourites, Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, and perhaps for that reason it's a super sexy exhilarating ride. It is one of those movies I can re-watch quite frequently. I'd say I dig it out at least every 6 months or so. And I love it every time! I love Keanu's character - can we say SEXXXXY? - and Sandra's is entertaining as well. Annie really steps up to the plate when a very scary situation calls for it. This movie is action-packed, and has sad as well as exciting moments. I never cease to get really sad at one particular scene that I won't mention 'cause, you know, that'd be a spoiler. All in all, yep, this is still a favourite and never gets old!

    - A- This is a very good action film that has enough action to out best many films of its type. Sandra Bullock is very good as the driver and Keanu Reeves as the cop and Dennis Hopper as the villain. I'm not a huge Keanu Reeves fan, but really liked him in this film. The characters on the bus are good and the cops are fun too. The action is big, explosive, and a lot of fun. The script is a lot of fun even though there is a ton of cursing in it. The ending is good and one that will inspire sequels, but it'll be tough for them to live up to this one. Great fun.

    This is a dumb but exhilarating and entertaining movie. Although some parts of the movie doesn't make much sense. It's still one of the good action movies from the 90's. I can see where Hideo Kojima got some of his ideas from for his "Metal Gear Solid" game and some of those ideas probably came from watching this movie. It's a cool movie with a cool and charismatic protagonist played by Keanu Reeves who plays Officer Jack Traven. Who will do everything he can to save innocent lives from the clutches of the bad guy. But yeah, the plot is basically about a old guy wanting 3.7 million dollars by taking people hostage. And he goes about it in a dumb manner for a guy that is suppose to be intelligent. And that villain is played by Dennis Hopper who is actually good as the villain in this movie but plays a character that basically asks the good guys to beat him. Anyways after his first scheme he decides to rig a bus with passengers with a bomb and the bus has to go over 50 miles an hour for it not to blow up with innocent lives. And it's up to Officer Jack Traven and the police force to stop the guy. Overall this is a good solid fun popcorn flick from the 90's. Even the beginning credit scene I usually want to skip through I enjoyed because of this movie's theme music, which is also cool and memorable. And sounds similar to one of the songs in "Metal Gear Solid". 8/10

    If you take John McClane and put him on bus, you get Speed, and like Die Hard there's action, Comedy moments, one liners, more action, and a fantastic script. Officer Jack Travis (Keanu Reeves), off the back of winning a medal along with his partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) for foiling a terrorist attack on a hotel, assumes that terrorist is dead having heard the bomb explode, only for him to be alive and already have his next target, a downtown bus filled with passengers. The reason: he wants $3million, The catch: if the bus goes below 50mph the bomb will explode and if anyone gets off the bus the bomb explodes, leaving it up to Jack to try and save the day by racing after the bus and getting on it and somehow hoping it doesn't run out of road or gas. its tense and exciting with thrilling moments, particularly a scene in which the speeding bus must jump and near 50 foot gap in an unfinished bridge. Even for a movie with such a clever script there is plenty of time for fantastic action sequences and will probably leave you disappointed that the movie isn't longer With an all star cast including: Sandra Bullock, Joe Morton, and Dennis Hopper, along with a twist about the villain and some clever writing, Speed puts you right in the passenger seat in a fantastic action movie that has its sad and romantic moments. Speed will end up making you hope you don't run in to many red lights or traffic on your way to work. Best Quote: Harry:"You shot me, I can't believe it. They're giving you a medal for shooting me, you little prick" If you enjoyed watching:....Die Hard, Eagle Eye....you'll enjoy watching Speed.

    Keaneu Reeves plays Officer Jack Traven, who, along with his partner Harry(Jeff Daniels) stop a bomber's plan to destroy an elevator full of people to receive a ransom. Unfortunately, the bomber( played enthusiastically by Dennis Hopper) survived, and engages his back-up plan: To strap a bomb on a city bus, and tell Jack that if it goes below 50 miles an hour, it will blow up. So Jack must hop on the moving bus, and find a way to get the passengers off safely before the bus is blown up... Exciting, extremely well-directed(Jan De Bont) and sharply written action film hits a Bullseye, thanks to a breathless pace, and a most appealing cast of characters, especially Sandra Bullock as Annie Porter, who became a star with her winning performance. Will resonate more with people who have had to ever take a city bus!

    Hard to believe it's nearing 20 years since they released Speed. And it, pretty much, still holds up today. This was just one of the long lines of very good to great movies that starred and was certainly not helped by: Keanu Reeves. At the time, he was the luckiest man in Hollywood, from Bram Stoker's Dracula to Speed to The Matrix. He got to be in the cream of the crop without having to show any depth or acting ability. Perhaps, that's what director Jan de Bont was looking for here: a soulless and cardboard cop and well, there you go. Actually, the real star here was Sandra Bullock and this was her break-through role. She stole every scene, had the best lines and timing and looked stunning. Hell, even Dennis Hopper's juicy and fun Howard "anything but a" Payne was no match for Bullock. So, if you forget the forgettable Jeff Daniels and Joe Morton and, naturally, whiteout Reeves, the true stars were Bullock and Hopper. They were so good, that even with the great amount of enormously enjoyable action, it's worth seeing just for them two. Speed focuses on disgruntled Payne and when his terrorist plot of bombing an elevator  too bad he didn't pick the one from the terrible Devil movie  is thwarted by the cops (Reeves's Jack Traven and Daniels's Harry Temple,) Payne shifts to road wars. He rigs a bus that, once it hits 50 mph, it will explode if it slows below 50 mph. Luckily, for everyone on this LA bus, when the bus does hit 50 mph, it's navigated by shrewd, albeit rightfully scared, passenger Annie Porter and Traven, who happened to "catch the bus." There are rules, of course  this is a 90s terrorist action flick, duh. No one can get off the bus, and Payne wants money for an undisclosed and anti-spoiler reason, or he'll blow the bus. Annie must pilot this bus through the already terrible LA traffic while the stiff, er, Jack figures out what to do. Since the years, and now almost decades, since this came out, this movie's been dissected enough. Sure, there are huge plot holes, some even big enough to drive (or leap) said bus through  even at 50 mph, but if you sit back, leave your brain at the door, you can enjoy the ride. It's campy 90s action fare, and for those of us who loved it back then and still do, this is the movie for us. I will say, I do have one huge problem with this. Okay, maybe not the original, but the sequel. STAY AWAY FROM (anything but) Speed 2: Cruise Control. That movie was a tragedy from beginning to end. And this kind of movie did NOT need a sequel. It was great as it was. Just have fun here and don't take the next bus.

    A psychopathic bomber (Dennis Hopper) is extorting the city. He has rigged an elevator full of people to plummet. Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) is a brash young police officer. Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) is his steady partner. Together the two officers foil the bomber's plan in a nick of time. Then the bomber blows up a bus, and tells Traven that he will blow another one. Once that bus hits 50 mph, the bomb will arm and explode if it slows below 50. When the driver got shot, Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) had to take over the driving. The premise is simple to understand. It's visceral and easy. But it's all about the fun dialog. It is no surprise that Joss Whedon wrote all the dialog. It's snappy and fun. Sandra Bullock is the perfect conduit to put all those exchanges. At the start, Jeff Daniels and Keanu Reeves have that great chemistry. Then they switch it to Sandra. The writing really puts it over the top of just another good action thriller.

    This film was fantastic. One, because it gave me all these emotions while I was watching it. I was happy, scared, Frustrated, confused and etc. It felt like I was a passenger on the bus too. Two, because the actors were extremely good, they exaggerated and really suited the film. I also believe its Keanu Reeves best film he has ever acted in. and three, because the start of the film, and how they introduced it made me wonder what will happen next.It made me focus a lot more than I usually do when watching a film also, this was because the introduction seemed intense.

    Greetings from Lithuania. "Speed" is a real action classic. Everything in this movie works. Action sequences are great, effects top notch even in this time, chemistry between actor is solid, script is great for this kind of movie. This movie grabs you from the opening titles till the very last end - and you can count these kind of movies on one hand. Keanu Reeves is brilliant straightforward action hero in "Speed". Sandra Bullock is great also. This is an action film for the ages - it's doesn't get old. This is one of my favorite action films of all time. If you still haven't see it (i hardly imagine that this possible) - do as fast as you can.

I can see where Hideo Kojima got some of his ideas from for his "Metal Gear Solid" game and some of those ideas probably came from watching this movie. It's a cool movie with a cool and charismatic protagonist played by Keanu Reeves who plays Officer Jack Traven. Who will do everything he can to save innocent lives from the clutches of the bad guy. But yeah, the plot is basically about a old guy wanting 3.7 million dollars by taking people hostage. And he goes about it in a dumb manner for a guy that is suppose to be intelligent. And that villain is played by Dennis Hopper who is actually good as the villain in this movie but plays a character that basically asks the good guys to beat him. Anyways after his first scheme he decides to rig a bus with passengers with a bomb and the bus has to go over 50 miles an hour for it not to blow up with innocent lives. And it's up to Officer Jack Traven and the police force to stop the guy. Overall this is a good solid fun popcorn flick from the 90's. Even the beginning credit scene I usually want to skip through I enjoyed because of this movie's theme music, which is also cool and memorable. And sounds similar to one of the songs in "Metal Gear Solid". 8/10

    If you take John McClane and put him on bus, you get Speed, and like Die Hard there's action, Comedy moments, one liners, more action, and a fantastic script. Officer Jack Travis (Keanu Reeves), off the back of winning a medal along with his partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) for foiling a terrorist attack on a hotel, assumes that terrorist is dead having heard the bomb explode, only for him to be alive and already have his next target, a downtown bus filled with passengers. The reason: he wants $3million, The catch: if the bus goes below 50mph the bomb will explode and if anyone gets off the bus the bomb explodes, leaving it up to Jack to try and save the day by racing after the bus and getting on it and somehow hoping it doesn't run out of road or gas. its tense and exciting with thrilling moments, particularly a scene in which the speeding bus must jump and near 50 foot gap in an unfinished bridge. Even for a movie with such a clever script there is plenty of time for fantastic action sequences and will probably leave you disappointed that the movie isn't longer With an all star cast including: Sandra Bullock, Joe Morton, and Dennis Hopper, along with a twist about the villain and some clever writing, Speed puts you right in the passenger seat in a fantastic action movie that has its sad and romantic moments. Speed will end up making you hope you don't run in to many red lights or traffic on your way to work. Best Quote: Harry:"You shot me, I can't believe it. They're giving you a medal for shooting me, you little prick" If you enjoyed watching:....Die Hard, Eagle Eye....you'll enjoy watching Speed.

    Keaneu Reeves plays Officer Jack Traven, who, along with his partner Harry(Jeff Daniels) stop a bomber's plan to destroy an elevator full of people to receive a ransom. Unfortunately, the bomber( played enthusiastically by Dennis Hopper) survived, and engages his back-up plan: To strap a bomb on a city bus, and tell Jack that if it goes below 50 miles an hour, it will blow up. So Jack must hop on the moving bus, and find a way to get the passengers off safely before the bus is blown up... Exciting, extremely well-directed(Jan De Bont) and sharply written action film hits a Bullseye, thanks to a breathless pace, and a most appealing cast of characters, especially Sandra Bullock as Annie Porter, who became a star with her winning performance. Will resonate more with people who have had to ever take a city bus!

    Hard to believe it's nearing 20 years since they released Speed. And it, pretty much, still holds up today. This was just one of the long lines of very good to great movies that starred and was certainly not helped by: Keanu Reeves. At the time, he was the luckiest man in Hollywood, from Bram Stoker's Dracula to Speed to The Matrix. He got to be in the cream of the crop without having to show any depth or acting ability. Perhaps, that's what director Jan de Bont was looking for here: a soulless and cardboard cop and well, there you go. Actually, the real star here was Sandra Bullock and this was her break-through role. She stole every scene, had the best lines and timing and looked stunning. Hell, even Dennis Hopper's juicy and fun Howard "anything but a" Payne was no match for Bullock. So, if you forget the forgettable Jeff Daniels and Joe Morton and, naturally, whiteout Reeves, the true stars were Bullock and Hopper. They were so good, that even with the great amount of enormously enjoyable action, it's worth seeing just for them two. Speed focuses on disgruntled Payne and when his terrorist plot of bombing an elevator  too bad he didn't pick the one from the terrible Devil movie  is thwarted by the cops (Reeves's Jack Traven and Daniels's Harry Temple,) Payne shifts to road wars. He rigs a bus that, once it hits 50 mph, it will explode if it slows below 50 mph. Luckily, for everyone on this LA bus, when the bus does hit 50 mph, it's navigated by shrewd, albeit rightfully scared, passenger Annie Porter and Traven, who happened to "catch the bus." There are rules, of course  this is a 90s terrorist action flick, duh. No one can get off the bus, and Payne wants money for an undisclosed and anti-spoiler reason, or he'll blow the bus. Annie must pilot this bus through the already terrible LA traffic while the stiff, er, Jack figures out what to do. Since the years, and now almost decades, since this came out, this movie's been dissected enough. Sure, there are huge plot holes, some even big enough to drive (or leap) said bus through  even at 50 mph, but if you sit back, leave your brain at the door, you can enjoy the ride. It's campy 90s action fare, and for those of us who loved it back then and still do, this is the movie for us. I will say, I do have one huge problem with this. Okay, maybe not the original, but the sequel. STAY AWAY FROM (anything but) Speed 2: Cruise Control. That movie was a tragedy from beginning to end. And this kind of movie did NOT need a sequel. It was great as it was. Just have fun here and don't take the next bus.

    A psychopathic bomber (Dennis Hopper) is extorting the city. He has rigged an elevator full of people to plummet. Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) is a brash young police officer. Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) is his steady partner. Together the two officers foil the bomber's plan in a nick of time. Then the bomber blows up a bus, and tells Traven that he will blow another one. Once that bus hits 50 mph, the bomb will arm and explode if it slows below 50. When the driver got shot, Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) had to take over the driving. The premise is simple to understand. It's visceral and easy. But it's all about the fun dialog. It is no surprise that Joss Whedon wrote all the dialog. It's snappy and fun. Sandra Bullock is the perfect conduit to put all those exchanges. At the start, Jeff Daniels and Keanu Reeves have that great chemistry. Then they switch it to Sandra. The writing really puts it over the top of just another good action thriller.

    This film was fantastic. One, because it gave me all these emotions while I was watching it. I was happy, scared, Frustrated, confused and etc. It felt like I was a passenger on the bus too. Two, because the actors were extremely good, they exaggerated and really suited the film. I also believe its Keanu Reeves best film he has ever acted in. and three, because the start of the film, and how they introduced it made me wonder what will happen next.It made me focus a lot more than I usually do when watching a film also, this was because the introduction seemed intense.

    Greetings from Lithuania. "Speed" is a real action classic. Everything in this movie works. Action sequences are great, effects top notch even in this time, chemistry between actor is solid, script is great for this kind of movie. This movie grabs you from the opening titles till the very last end - and you can count these kind of movies on one hand. Keanu Reeves is brilliant straightforward action hero in "Speed". Sandra Bullock is great also. This is an action film for the ages - it's doesn't get old. This is one of my favorite action films of all time. If you still haven't see it (i hardly imagine that this possible) - do as fast as you can.

    A great, thriller movie for 13+ older. Contains tons of suspense and thrills. What else can I say about this awesome movie? Oh yeah. It made me have a faster heart beat than usual. I also think the performance of the actors were perfect. They showed the emotions very well. I also have to admit though, that Dennis Hopper's performance was bit off when it came to his evil schemes. Here's some of the obstacles they had to get through: made a successful jump through a 50 feet ramp, went through the city, nearly hit pedestrians, trying to get Sam (the bus driver) off after being shot in the back, a fuel leakage, racing through the airport, trying to disable the bomb underneath the bus and unloading passengers off the bus while in motion. I give this movie a 10/10 for its thrills and suspense.

    Speed stars two of my screen favourites, Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, and perhaps for that reason it's a super sexy exhilarating ride. It is one of those movies I can re-watch quite frequently. I'd say I dig it out at least every 6 months or so. And I love it every time! I love Keanu's character - can we say SEXXXXY? - and Sandra's is entertaining as well. Annie really steps up to the plate when a very scary situation calls for it. This movie is action-packed, and has sad as well as exciting moments. I never cease to get really sad at one particular scene that I won't mention 'cause, you know, that'd be a spoiler. All in all, yep, this is still a favourite and never gets old!

    - A- This is a very good action film that has enough action to out best many films of its type. Sandra Bullock is very good as the driver and Keanu Reeves as the cop and Dennis Hopper as the villain. I'm not a huge Keanu Reeves fan, but really liked him in this film. The characters on the bus are good and the cops are fun too. The action is big, explosive, and a lot of fun. The script is a lot of fun even though there is a ton of cursing in it. The ending is good and one that will inspire sequels, but it'll be tough for them to live up to this one. Great fun.
