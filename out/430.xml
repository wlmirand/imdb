    These days "Duck Soup" is generally considered the best of the Marx brothers comedies. However, at the time of its original release, its poor reception was one of the contributing factors to the brothers' split from Paramount. It was also the last of their films to feature Zeppo, who never really stood out much due to his role as a straight man to his brothers' zany antics. In this movie Groucho plays Rufus T. Firefly, the newly appointed leader of the fictional country of Freedonia. Zeppo plays his secretary while Chico and Harpo team up as spies for the Sylvanian ambassador, who is attempting to incite a revolution. The brothers were all in good form for this picture and were joined by frequent comic foil Margaret Dumont. Louis Calhern was also effective as the villain of the piece. Verbal comedy is where the film shines and all of these individuals worked quite well together. On the other hand, I found that some of the physical comedy bits just went on too long. Future Oscar winner Leo McCarey directed the film and I have no complaints about his work here. For the most part, he avoided the staginess of the earlier films. The musical numbers are pretty well done, too, though I would have liked to have seen the brothers themselves show off their instrumental skills as they often did in their movies. Ultimately, I consider this my second favourite Marx brothers comedy after "A Night at the Opera". There seem to be differing viewpoints on which one is superior. Personally, I find that this film's anarchic quality is endearing but it doesn't produce as cohesive an experience as their MGM productions that were soon to come.

    Just rewatched this classic Four Marx Brothers comedy on DVD. It has Groucho once again wooing Margaret Dumont while insulting her though she doesn't seem to notice. It has Chico and Harpo as peanut vendors also insulting Edgar Kennedy as a lemonade vendor including the "mixed hats" routine which director Leo McCarey probably invented for Laurel & Hardy back in the '20s when they all were at Hal Roach Studios. And it has Zeppo in his last screen role before switching to the other side of show business, here performing with his brothers in his only musical number with them. Oh, and then there's the iconic mirror sequence with Groucho and Chico and Harpo with the latter two dressing like the first one. In short, it has all the ingredients of perhaps the greatest of the Marx Brothers comedies. And while I enjoy the piano and harp solos of Chico and Harpo, respectively, the fact neither do their music here adds to the enjoyment though I guess something had to be done to the piano displayed here so Harpo decided to just pluck on the strings like his beloved instrument to satisfy some of his penchant for skill playing...

    This is among the oldest movies that I ever tried to watch. It is indeed a very classic stuff and I noticed that it is a very fast paced movie: I though that movies from 1930 would be very slow paced but this one is anything but that, it is full of very good jokes and fast paced delivery. I also found interesting to note that many of the jokes used in this movie became so iconic that I instantly recognized their use in several other media. The mirror joke, for instance, is perhaps one of the greatest moments of this film and has so great an influence that every comedy series today, such as Family Guy, still uses the same joke. It was truly the work of genius to devise such a joke at the time.

    Without a silly romantic subplot to get in their way, or serious musical interludes, the audience is treated to 100% pure Marxian chaos. The humor remains as fresh as ever. Who can hear Grouch sing his plans for leaving Fredonia worse than he found it without thinking of a certain former president. It also features one of their most famous scenes - the mirror scene. Interesting that a comedy group known for their punchlines would be most remembered for a scene that takes place in complete silence. This also marks the last time all four brothers appeared in on screen together. Check out my fill review http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/02/25/duck-soup/

    Greetings again from the darkness. It's been 20-25 years since I last watched this one, so catching it on the big screen was a real treat. I laughed at almost every scene, as this is the Marx Brothers best combination of quips, puns, political satire and physical sight gags. They are in prime form and for the first and only time, are directed by a real director ... Leo McCarey (also known for An Affair to Remember, and Going My Way). The script is from Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, with additional dialogue by the great Arthur Sheekman. Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo star together for the last time, as Zeppo decided to join brother Gummo on the business side. Groucho plays Rufus T Firefly who is (somehow) named as the new leader of Freedonia, the bankrupt country backed by millionaire widow Mrs Teasdale (played by Margaret Dumont). A childish spat between Firefly and the ambassador of Sylvania lead the two countries to war. Of course, in between, there is a huge musical production sequence and too many funny gags to keep track of. The film is recognized as the first political satire film and was released just 3 years after the death of silent films. Much of the film is spent as commentary on the absurdity of war and ego involved in most conflicts. A couple of the iconic sight gags include the famous "mirror" scene with Groucho and Harpo, and the hilarious "hat scene" with Chico, Harpo and silent film star Edgar Kennedy (as a lemonade vendor). There is also one of the most bizarre early special effects (a tattoo on Harpo's chest) and a Dallas, Texas joke that generated applause from the audience. The film even pokes fun at the Hays Code (morality censorship) with a shot of a pair of men's shoes, a pair of women's shoes, and a set of horseshoes, and then a quick cut to twin beds and an odd sleeping arrangement. The film came out at a time when much cynicism existed toward the Great War and the Depression was still a fact of life in the U.S. Because of that, the film may be easier for us to watch now than it was at the time of its release. Even the Freedonia anthem, which is played several times throughout, is a spoof on the Star Spangled banner with it's only line being "Hail Hail Freedonia, land of the brave and free". Support work is also provided by Louis Calhern, but it's Margaret Dumont who never ceases to amaze. A consistent presence in Marx Brother films, she is the epitome of the "comedy straight man". How she ever played her role seriously given the Marx Brothers hijinks is beyond belief. She even gets to flash her classically trained singing voice, though it provides a flying fruit ending. The Marx Brothers made 13 movies and this was their fifth, and probably best. The five brothers only appeared together on screen one time ... on a TV talk show in 1957. Their vaudeville and stage act continued to be the basis for their films, and was undoubtedly a factor in their incredible comedic timing. While it is understandable that the Marx Brothers humor may not be to every person's taste, it is impossible to ignore their impact on film comedy. Hail Hail Freedonia!!

    A big glass eliminate. "Duck Soup" is often hysterical madcap comedy, showcasing the legendary Marx Brothers unit to great effect. The songs are catchy, the energy incredible, and the delivery breathless. Many of the comedies of today have got nothing on this level of invention, satirical detail, and genuine belly laughs. The irrepressible Groucho is Rufus T. Firefly, elevated to the position of president / dictator of tiny, financially strapped country Freedonia. Rufus's cheeky and sardonic ways only serve to create problems, not the least of which is rubbing the leader of the neighbouring country Sylvania the wrong way. The one liners come fast and furious, and the cast plays the entire thing to perfection. Among the many set pieces are the repeated scuffles Harpo and Chico, as spies Pinky and Chicolini, get into with a street vendor, the sight of three Grouchos running about (as Pinky and Chicolini masquerade as Rufus in order to get their hands on valuable battle plans), and of course the one sequence everybody remembers, the mirror sequence, which is old style vaudeville at its best. Margaret Dumont is a delight in her perpetual "straight woman" role, often uttering her lines in a priceless sing song style. It's too bad that this would be the last time that Zeppo would act with his brothers, as he's given a fair amount to do here, and one of the biggest joys is seeing the brothers performing together near the end. Harpo gets some big laughs with his silent comedy; the moment where he's showing off his tattoos is a riot. Clocking in at a tight 69 minutes, the movie maintains a fine forward momentum and builds towards a priceless finale where, among other things, Rufus fires on his own soldiers! Overall this is an absolute must for any comedy fan, as it starts brightly and keeps coming up with enough witty exchanges to make for very pleasant viewing. Nine out of 10.

    This is mayhem, and, chaos, and nutty, and havoc, and very funny. It proves once and for all that Duck Soup, if it is made by a great chef.......tastes wonderful. Made in 1933, this Marx Brothers classic is the funniest movie in motion picture history. Groucho delivers his one liners with machine gun precision.....and always hits the target. There will simply NEVER be any "funny guy" who will even come close to The Grouch. Its a fact.....during the past 79 years no comedy has bettered this. The last 25 years have been really bad....badly written, terribly acted....and NOT funny. Its all so pretentious, today. Will Ferrell ?? are we kidding ?? The guy is awful. And "the others" are only marginally better. Writers should remember a simple rule..........people who go to the cinema to see a comedy........expect to laugh.

    "Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together. After one taste, you'll duck soup for the rest of your life." - Groucho Marx's explanation for the title of Duck Soup. Duck Soup is an unprecedented comedy of wit and satire, with its range of material and jokes reaching a rare amount of diversity. The film is short, whimsical, and delightfully anarchic at only sixty-eight minutes, and it seems after every ten minutes you need a break to sometimes decipher what just happened. Things progress at a rapid fire pace, and the end feels like about twenty-five minutes or so got lost in a blaze. This sounds like how I'd comment on a bad film, but Duck Soup uses these tactics in its favor. Its main benefit is that the brothers wanted to do nothing more than make an enjoyable comedy, but they accidentally succeeded in making one of the most cynical and brutally honest political satires in a blue moon. It's very rare that I award a comedy a perfect rating, but Duck Soup has proved to be more than meets the eye in substance, character-acting, and overall, look and feel. We are placed in the country of Freedonia, a small, corrupt, and bankrupt place that has struggled politically for many years. Mrs. Teasdale (Dumont) suggest they appoint Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) as the leader of the country, and see if he can get the country back on the route of prosperity. It's clear that his plans are radical, unsustainable, and virtually outlandish. The funny part is no one sees it that way. He says that anyone chewing gum will be pursued, and despite how absurd that idea is, no one scolds him. They are too smitten with his sunny and kind-hearted disposition. Perhaps that's how we are as people. While this is in the mix, the neighboring country of Sylvania has been itching to take over the land of Freedonia, and the Sylvanian ambassador Trentino (Calhern) attempts to destroy the country bit by bit by hiring two spies to dig up dirt on Firefly, and further tries to implement and carry on with a revolution. The spies he appoints, Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo), are incompetent buffoons who wind up being unnecessary roadblocks and distractions, bringing trouble wherever they show up. This results in a never-ending slew of comedic possibilities, all working in the film's favor. Next to Rufus, the funniest character is Chicolini, the silent half of the spy duo, who appears in some of the film's most enjoyable segments. There are a number of scenes where Chicolini and Pinky obnoxiously harass a poor street vendor who wants nothing but a successful business. This results in the infamous scene where the three tirelessly exchange hats, and where Chicolini jumps into and rides the bucket of lemonade like a bicycle, disgusting the vendors' customers. The scene is simply hilarious, and I can't recall laughing harder to a scene in a comedy in recent years. But what makes Chicolini's character avoid insufferable schtick is his ability to perform physical comedy. His facial expressions are simply entrancing and his antics on par with his explosive personality. He's almost like Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean, but more shameless and rowdy. Chicolini has an intense and infectious form of likability, and he never comes off as a nuisance. Duck Soup was released in 1933, and was met with less than stellar box office numbers, causing Paramount to drop The Marx Brothers, among other issues. The most likely reason it took in a low amount of revenue is because of the subject matter. The film is highly cynical, sarcastic, and unapologetically rude. America was hitting the time of The Great Depression, among the beginning stages of World War II. It goes to show that people weren't interested in seeing a cheeky, satirical portrayal of government and politics. Thankfully, the film has gotten its proper respect over the years, and is often hailed as The Marx Brothers' best film. I also wouldn't hesitate to bill this as one of the funniest and smartest comedy films ever made. At least on my personal list. The film tackles a number of subjects, from politics, imperialism, government, outlandish rules, and society itself, and satirizes them to the point of utter disbelief and hilarity. In no way is the film mean-spirited or deliberately crude. This was before that became the standard in comedy. It always keeps a sunny, cheery disposition, right down to the final frame. Its bravery is astonishing, even to this day. How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? This is comedic and satirical filmmaking at its absolute finest. The Marx Brothers are clearly a treasure, under-appreciated in this day and age, and painfully overlooked in a time where politics and social issues plague our nation. Duck Soup is slapstick done right, with a great band of character actors, one-liners galore, and a simple and effective premise that goes very far, surpassing anyone's expectations of "another stupid comedy from the year one." NOTE: It's also interesting to note that Groucho goes on record saying that him and his three brothers were just "Jews trying to get laughs." He denies that the film covered the topics of government and politics purposefully, and that he believes people read too much into it. I guess I'll reword my previous question like so; "How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? And they don't even try?" Starring: Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, Zeppo Marx, Margaret Dumont, Louis Calhern, Raquel Torres, and Edgar Kennedy. Directed by: Leo McCarey.

    The last 15 minutes of Duck Soup, inside Groucho's command headquarters during the war with Sylvania, are the funniest 15 minutes in film history. Non stop verbal, physical and visual gags, puns and insults, and almost all of them hit the mark , and play well 80 years later. Aide to Groucho, who is shooting out the window - " But sir, you are shooting your own men. Groucho hands the aide a bill - "here's five dollars , keep it under your hat." Grouch takes the five dollars back and says "better yet, I'll keep it under my hat." Duck Soup is the best Marx Brothers film because it is the most cynical and anarchic of them all. Some of the jokes are dated beyond help, and make cultural references that today's generation simply will not understand or appreciate, but those last 15 minutes are enough in itself to make this one of the all time great comedies.

The songs are catchy, the energy incredible, and the delivery breathless. Many of the comedies of today have got nothing on this level of invention, satirical detail, and genuine belly laughs. The irrepressible Groucho is Rufus T. Firefly, elevated to the position of president / dictator of tiny, financially strapped country Freedonia. Rufus's cheeky and sardonic ways only serve to create problems, not the least of which is rubbing the leader of the neighbouring country Sylvania the wrong way. The one liners come fast and furious, and the cast plays the entire thing to perfection. Among the many set pieces are the repeated scuffles Harpo and Chico, as spies Pinky and Chicolini, get into with a street vendor, the sight of three Grouchos running about (as Pinky and Chicolini masquerade as Rufus in order to get their hands on valuable battle plans), and of course the one sequence everybody remembers, the mirror sequence, which is old style vaudeville at its best. Margaret Dumont is a delight in her perpetual "straight woman" role, often uttering her lines in a priceless sing song style. It's too bad that this would be the last time that Zeppo would act with his brothers, as he's given a fair amount to do here, and one of the biggest joys is seeing the brothers performing together near the end. Harpo gets some big laughs with his silent comedy; the moment where he's showing off his tattoos is a riot. Clocking in at a tight 69 minutes, the movie maintains a fine forward momentum and builds towards a priceless finale where, among other things, Rufus fires on his own soldiers! Overall this is an absolute must for any comedy fan, as it starts brightly and keeps coming up with enough witty exchanges to make for very pleasant viewing. Nine out of 10.

    This is mayhem, and, chaos, and nutty, and havoc, and very funny. It proves once and for all that Duck Soup, if it is made by a great chef.......tastes wonderful. Made in 1933, this Marx Brothers classic is the funniest movie in motion picture history. Groucho delivers his one liners with machine gun precision.....and always hits the target. There will simply NEVER be any "funny guy" who will even come close to The Grouch. Its a fact.....during the past 79 years no comedy has bettered this. The last 25 years have been really bad....badly written, terribly acted....and NOT funny. Its all so pretentious, today. Will Ferrell ?? are we kidding ?? The guy is awful. And "the others" are only marginally better. Writers should remember a simple rule..........people who go to the cinema to see a comedy........expect to laugh.

    "Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together. After one taste, you'll duck soup for the rest of your life." - Groucho Marx's explanation for the title of Duck Soup. Duck Soup is an unprecedented comedy of wit and satire, with its range of material and jokes reaching a rare amount of diversity. The film is short, whimsical, and delightfully anarchic at only sixty-eight minutes, and it seems after every ten minutes you need a break to sometimes decipher what just happened. Things progress at a rapid fire pace, and the end feels like about twenty-five minutes or so got lost in a blaze. This sounds like how I'd comment on a bad film, but Duck Soup uses these tactics in its favor. Its main benefit is that the brothers wanted to do nothing more than make an enjoyable comedy, but they accidentally succeeded in making one of the most cynical and brutally honest political satires in a blue moon. It's very rare that I award a comedy a perfect rating, but Duck Soup has proved to be more than meets the eye in substance, character-acting, and overall, look and feel. We are placed in the country of Freedonia, a small, corrupt, and bankrupt place that has struggled politically for many years. Mrs. Teasdale (Dumont) suggest they appoint Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) as the leader of the country, and see if he can get the country back on the route of prosperity. It's clear that his plans are radical, unsustainable, and virtually outlandish. The funny part is no one sees it that way. He says that anyone chewing gum will be pursued, and despite how absurd that idea is, no one scolds him. They are too smitten with his sunny and kind-hearted disposition. Perhaps that's how we are as people. While this is in the mix, the neighboring country of Sylvania has been itching to take over the land of Freedonia, and the Sylvanian ambassador Trentino (Calhern) attempts to destroy the country bit by bit by hiring two spies to dig up dirt on Firefly, and further tries to implement and carry on with a revolution. The spies he appoints, Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo), are incompetent buffoons who wind up being unnecessary roadblocks and distractions, bringing trouble wherever they show up. This results in a never-ending slew of comedic possibilities, all working in the film's favor. Next to Rufus, the funniest character is Chicolini, the silent half of the spy duo, who appears in some of the film's most enjoyable segments. There are a number of scenes where Chicolini and Pinky obnoxiously harass a poor street vendor who wants nothing but a successful business. This results in the infamous scene where the three tirelessly exchange hats, and where Chicolini jumps into and rides the bucket of lemonade like a bicycle, disgusting the vendors' customers. The scene is simply hilarious, and I can't recall laughing harder to a scene in a comedy in recent years. But what makes Chicolini's character avoid insufferable schtick is his ability to perform physical comedy. His facial expressions are simply entrancing and his antics on par with his explosive personality. He's almost like Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean, but more shameless and rowdy. Chicolini has an intense and infectious form of likability, and he never comes off as a nuisance. Duck Soup was released in 1933, and was met with less than stellar box office numbers, causing Paramount to drop The Marx Brothers, among other issues. The most likely reason it took in a low amount of revenue is because of the subject matter. The film is highly cynical, sarcastic, and unapologetically rude. America was hitting the time of The Great Depression, among the beginning stages of World War II. It goes to show that people weren't interested in seeing a cheeky, satirical portrayal of government and politics. Thankfully, the film has gotten its proper respect over the years, and is often hailed as The Marx Brothers' best film. I also wouldn't hesitate to bill this as one of the funniest and smartest comedy films ever made. At least on my personal list. The film tackles a number of subjects, from politics, imperialism, government, outlandish rules, and society itself, and satirizes them to the point of utter disbelief and hilarity. In no way is the film mean-spirited or deliberately crude. This was before that became the standard in comedy. It always keeps a sunny, cheery disposition, right down to the final frame. Its bravery is astonishing, even to this day. How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? This is comedic and satirical filmmaking at its absolute finest. The Marx Brothers are clearly a treasure, under-appreciated in this day and age, and painfully overlooked in a time where politics and social issues plague our nation. Duck Soup is slapstick done right, with a great band of character actors, one-liners galore, and a simple and effective premise that goes very far, surpassing anyone's expectations of "another stupid comedy from the year one." NOTE: It's also interesting to note that Groucho goes on record saying that him and his three brothers were just "Jews trying to get laughs." He denies that the film covered the topics of government and politics purposefully, and that he believes people read too much into it. I guess I'll reword my previous question like so; "How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? And they don't even try?" Starring: Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, Zeppo Marx, Margaret Dumont, Louis Calhern, Raquel Torres, and Edgar Kennedy. Directed by: Leo McCarey.

    The last 15 minutes of Duck Soup, inside Groucho's command headquarters during the war with Sylvania, are the funniest 15 minutes in film history. Non stop verbal, physical and visual gags, puns and insults, and almost all of them hit the mark , and play well 80 years later. Aide to Groucho, who is shooting out the window - " But sir, you are shooting your own men. Groucho hands the aide a bill - "here's five dollars , keep it under your hat." Grouch takes the five dollars back and says "better yet, I'll keep it under my hat." Duck Soup is the best Marx Brothers film because it is the most cynical and anarchic of them all. Some of the jokes are dated beyond help, and make cultural references that today's generation simply will not understand or appreciate, but those last 15 minutes are enough in itself to make this one of the all time great comedies.

    These days "Duck Soup" is generally considered the best of the Marx brothers comedies. However, at the time of its original release, its poor reception was one of the contributing factors to the brothers' split from Paramount. It was also the last of their films to feature Zeppo, who never really stood out much due to his role as a straight man to his brothers' zany antics. In this movie Groucho plays Rufus T. Firefly, the newly appointed leader of the fictional country of Freedonia. Zeppo plays his secretary while Chico and Harpo team up as spies for the Sylvanian ambassador, who is attempting to incite a revolution. The brothers were all in good form for this picture and were joined by frequent comic foil Margaret Dumont. Louis Calhern was also effective as the villain of the piece. Verbal comedy is where the film shines and all of these individuals worked quite well together. On the other hand, I found that some of the physical comedy bits just went on too long. Future Oscar winner Leo McCarey directed the film and I have no complaints about his work here. For the most part, he avoided the staginess of the earlier films. The musical numbers are pretty well done, too, though I would have liked to have seen the brothers themselves show off their instrumental skills as they often did in their movies. Ultimately, I consider this my second favourite Marx brothers comedy after "A Night at the Opera". There seem to be differing viewpoints on which one is superior. Personally, I find that this film's anarchic quality is endearing but it doesn't produce as cohesive an experience as their MGM productions that were soon to come.

    Just rewatched this classic Four Marx Brothers comedy on DVD. It has Groucho once again wooing Margaret Dumont while insulting her though she doesn't seem to notice. It has Chico and Harpo as peanut vendors also insulting Edgar Kennedy as a lemonade vendor including the "mixed hats" routine which director Leo McCarey probably invented for Laurel & Hardy back in the '20s when they all were at Hal Roach Studios. And it has Zeppo in his last screen role before switching to the other side of show business, here performing with his brothers in his only musical number with them. Oh, and then there's the iconic mirror sequence with Groucho and Chico and Harpo with the latter two dressing like the first one. In short, it has all the ingredients of perhaps the greatest of the Marx Brothers comedies. And while I enjoy the piano and harp solos of Chico and Harpo, respectively, the fact neither do their music here adds to the enjoyment though I guess something had to be done to the piano displayed here so Harpo decided to just pluck on the strings like his beloved instrument to satisfy some of his penchant for skill playing...

    This is among the oldest movies that I ever tried to watch. It is indeed a very classic stuff and I noticed that it is a very fast paced movie: I though that movies from 1930 would be very slow paced but this one is anything but that, it is full of very good jokes and fast paced delivery. I also found interesting to note that many of the jokes used in this movie became so iconic that I instantly recognized their use in several other media. The mirror joke, for instance, is perhaps one of the greatest moments of this film and has so great an influence that every comedy series today, such as Family Guy, still uses the same joke. It was truly the work of genius to devise such a joke at the time.

    Without a silly romantic subplot to get in their way, or serious musical interludes, the audience is treated to 100% pure Marxian chaos. The humor remains as fresh as ever. Who can hear Grouch sing his plans for leaving Fredonia worse than he found it without thinking of a certain former president. It also features one of their most famous scenes - the mirror scene. Interesting that a comedy group known for their punchlines would be most remembered for a scene that takes place in complete silence. This also marks the last time all four brothers appeared in on screen together. Check out my fill review http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/02/25/duck-soup/

    Greetings again from the darkness. It's been 20-25 years since I last watched this one, so catching it on the big screen was a real treat. I laughed at almost every scene, as this is the Marx Brothers best combination of quips, puns, political satire and physical sight gags. They are in prime form and for the first and only time, are directed by a real director ... Leo McCarey (also known for An Affair to Remember, and Going My Way). The script is from Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, with additional dialogue by the great Arthur Sheekman. Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo star together for the last time, as Zeppo decided to join brother Gummo on the business side. Groucho plays Rufus T Firefly who is (somehow) named as the new leader of Freedonia, the bankrupt country backed by millionaire widow Mrs Teasdale (played by Margaret Dumont). A childish spat between Firefly and the ambassador of Sylvania lead the two countries to war. Of course, in between, there is a huge musical production sequence and too many funny gags to keep track of. The film is recognized as the first political satire film and was released just 3 years after the death of silent films. Much of the film is spent as commentary on the absurdity of war and ego involved in most conflicts. A couple of the iconic sight gags include the famous "mirror" scene with Groucho and Harpo, and the hilarious "hat scene" with Chico, Harpo and silent film star Edgar Kennedy (as a lemonade vendor). There is also one of the most bizarre early special effects (a tattoo on Harpo's chest) and a Dallas, Texas joke that generated applause from the audience. The film even pokes fun at the Hays Code (morality censorship) with a shot of a pair of men's shoes, a pair of women's shoes, and a set of horseshoes, and then a quick cut to twin beds and an odd sleeping arrangement. The film came out at a time when much cynicism existed toward the Great War and the Depression was still a fact of life in the U.S. Because of that, the film may be easier for us to watch now than it was at the time of its release. Even the Freedonia anthem, which is played several times throughout, is a spoof on the Star Spangled banner with it's only line being "Hail Hail Freedonia, land of the brave and free". Support work is also provided by Louis Calhern, but it's Margaret Dumont who never ceases to amaze. A consistent presence in Marx Brother films, she is the epitome of the "comedy straight man". How she ever played her role seriously given the Marx Brothers hijinks is beyond belief. She even gets to flash her classically trained singing voice, though it provides a flying fruit ending. The Marx Brothers made 13 movies and this was their fifth, and probably best. The five brothers only appeared together on screen one time ... on a TV talk show in 1957. Their vaudeville and stage act continued to be the basis for their films, and was undoubtedly a factor in their incredible comedic timing. While it is understandable that the Marx Brothers humor may not be to every person's taste, it is impossible to ignore their impact on film comedy. Hail Hail Freedonia!!

The musical numbers are pretty well done, too, though I would have liked to have seen the brothers themselves show off their instrumental skills as they often did in their movies. Ultimately, I consider this my second favourite Marx brothers comedy after "A Night at the Opera". There seem to be differing viewpoints on which one is superior. Personally, I find that this film's anarchic quality is endearing but it doesn't produce as cohesive an experience as their MGM productions that were soon to come.

    Just rewatched this classic Four Marx Brothers comedy on DVD. It has Groucho once again wooing Margaret Dumont while insulting her though she doesn't seem to notice. It has Chico and Harpo as peanut vendors also insulting Edgar Kennedy as a lemonade vendor including the "mixed hats" routine which director Leo McCarey probably invented for Laurel & Hardy back in the '20s when they all were at Hal Roach Studios. And it has Zeppo in his last screen role before switching to the other side of show business, here performing with his brothers in his only musical number with them. Oh, and then there's the iconic mirror sequence with Groucho and Chico and Harpo with the latter two dressing like the first one. In short, it has all the ingredients of perhaps the greatest of the Marx Brothers comedies. And while I enjoy the piano and harp solos of Chico and Harpo, respectively, the fact neither do their music here adds to the enjoyment though I guess something had to be done to the piano displayed here so Harpo decided to just pluck on the strings like his beloved instrument to satisfy some of his penchant for skill playing...

    This is among the oldest movies that I ever tried to watch. It is indeed a very classic stuff and I noticed that it is a very fast paced movie: I though that movies from 1930 would be very slow paced but this one is anything but that, it is full of very good jokes and fast paced delivery. I also found interesting to note that many of the jokes used in this movie became so iconic that I instantly recognized their use in several other media. The mirror joke, for instance, is perhaps one of the greatest moments of this film and has so great an influence that every comedy series today, such as Family Guy, still uses the same joke. It was truly the work of genius to devise such a joke at the time.

    Without a silly romantic subplot to get in their way, or serious musical interludes, the audience is treated to 100% pure Marxian chaos. The humor remains as fresh as ever. Who can hear Grouch sing his plans for leaving Fredonia worse than he found it without thinking of a certain former president. It also features one of their most famous scenes - the mirror scene. Interesting that a comedy group known for their punchlines would be most remembered for a scene that takes place in complete silence. This also marks the last time all four brothers appeared in on screen together. Check out my fill review http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/02/25/duck-soup/

    Greetings again from the darkness. It's been 20-25 years since I last watched this one, so catching it on the big screen was a real treat. I laughed at almost every scene, as this is the Marx Brothers best combination of quips, puns, political satire and physical sight gags. They are in prime form and for the first and only time, are directed by a real director ... Leo McCarey (also known for An Affair to Remember, and Going My Way). The script is from Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, with additional dialogue by the great Arthur Sheekman. Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo star together for the last time, as Zeppo decided to join brother Gummo on the business side. Groucho plays Rufus T Firefly who is (somehow) named as the new leader of Freedonia, the bankrupt country backed by millionaire widow Mrs Teasdale (played by Margaret Dumont). A childish spat between Firefly and the ambassador of Sylvania lead the two countries to war. Of course, in between, there is a huge musical production sequence and too many funny gags to keep track of. The film is recognized as the first political satire film and was released just 3 years after the death of silent films. Much of the film is spent as commentary on the absurdity of war and ego involved in most conflicts. A couple of the iconic sight gags include the famous "mirror" scene with Groucho and Harpo, and the hilarious "hat scene" with Chico, Harpo and silent film star Edgar Kennedy (as a lemonade vendor). There is also one of the most bizarre early special effects (a tattoo on Harpo's chest) and a Dallas, Texas joke that generated applause from the audience. The film even pokes fun at the Hays Code (morality censorship) with a shot of a pair of men's shoes, a pair of women's shoes, and a set of horseshoes, and then a quick cut to twin beds and an odd sleeping arrangement. The film came out at a time when much cynicism existed toward the Great War and the Depression was still a fact of life in the U.S. Because of that, the film may be easier for us to watch now than it was at the time of its release. Even the Freedonia anthem, which is played several times throughout, is a spoof on the Star Spangled banner with it's only line being "Hail Hail Freedonia, land of the brave and free". Support work is also provided by Louis Calhern, but it's Margaret Dumont who never ceases to amaze. A consistent presence in Marx Brother films, she is the epitome of the "comedy straight man". How she ever played her role seriously given the Marx Brothers hijinks is beyond belief. She even gets to flash her classically trained singing voice, though it provides a flying fruit ending. The Marx Brothers made 13 movies and this was their fifth, and probably best. The five brothers only appeared together on screen one time ... on a TV talk show in 1957. Their vaudeville and stage act continued to be the basis for their films, and was undoubtedly a factor in their incredible comedic timing. While it is understandable that the Marx Brothers humor may not be to every person's taste, it is impossible to ignore their impact on film comedy. Hail Hail Freedonia!!

    A big glass eliminate. "Duck Soup" is often hysterical madcap comedy, showcasing the legendary Marx Brothers unit to great effect. The songs are catchy, the energy incredible, and the delivery breathless. Many of the comedies of today have got nothing on this level of invention, satirical detail, and genuine belly laughs. The irrepressible Groucho is Rufus T. Firefly, elevated to the position of president / dictator of tiny, financially strapped country Freedonia. Rufus's cheeky and sardonic ways only serve to create problems, not the least of which is rubbing the leader of the neighbouring country Sylvania the wrong way. The one liners come fast and furious, and the cast plays the entire thing to perfection. Among the many set pieces are the repeated scuffles Harpo and Chico, as spies Pinky and Chicolini, get into with a street vendor, the sight of three Grouchos running about (as Pinky and Chicolini masquerade as Rufus in order to get their hands on valuable battle plans), and of course the one sequence everybody remembers, the mirror sequence, which is old style vaudeville at its best. Margaret Dumont is a delight in her perpetual "straight woman" role, often uttering her lines in a priceless sing song style. It's too bad that this would be the last time that Zeppo would act with his brothers, as he's given a fair amount to do here, and one of the biggest joys is seeing the brothers performing together near the end. Harpo gets some big laughs with his silent comedy; the moment where he's showing off his tattoos is a riot. Clocking in at a tight 69 minutes, the movie maintains a fine forward momentum and builds towards a priceless finale where, among other things, Rufus fires on his own soldiers! Overall this is an absolute must for any comedy fan, as it starts brightly and keeps coming up with enough witty exchanges to make for very pleasant viewing. Nine out of 10.

    This is mayhem, and, chaos, and nutty, and havoc, and very funny. It proves once and for all that Duck Soup, if it is made by a great chef.......tastes wonderful. Made in 1933, this Marx Brothers classic is the funniest movie in motion picture history. Groucho delivers his one liners with machine gun precision.....and always hits the target. There will simply NEVER be any "funny guy" who will even come close to The Grouch. Its a fact.....during the past 79 years no comedy has bettered this. The last 25 years have been really bad....badly written, terribly acted....and NOT funny. Its all so pretentious, today. Will Ferrell ?? are we kidding ?? The guy is awful. And "the others" are only marginally better. Writers should remember a simple rule..........people who go to the cinema to see a comedy........expect to laugh.

    "Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together. After one taste, you'll duck soup for the rest of your life." - Groucho Marx's explanation for the title of Duck Soup. Duck Soup is an unprecedented comedy of wit and satire, with its range of material and jokes reaching a rare amount of diversity. The film is short, whimsical, and delightfully anarchic at only sixty-eight minutes, and it seems after every ten minutes you need a break to sometimes decipher what just happened. Things progress at a rapid fire pace, and the end feels like about twenty-five minutes or so got lost in a blaze. This sounds like how I'd comment on a bad film, but Duck Soup uses these tactics in its favor. Its main benefit is that the brothers wanted to do nothing more than make an enjoyable comedy, but they accidentally succeeded in making one of the most cynical and brutally honest political satires in a blue moon. It's very rare that I award a comedy a perfect rating, but Duck Soup has proved to be more than meets the eye in substance, character-acting, and overall, look and feel. We are placed in the country of Freedonia, a small, corrupt, and bankrupt place that has struggled politically for many years. Mrs. Teasdale (Dumont) suggest they appoint Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) as the leader of the country, and see if he can get the country back on the route of prosperity. It's clear that his plans are radical, unsustainable, and virtually outlandish. The funny part is no one sees it that way. He says that anyone chewing gum will be pursued, and despite how absurd that idea is, no one scolds him. They are too smitten with his sunny and kind-hearted disposition. Perhaps that's how we are as people. While this is in the mix, the neighboring country of Sylvania has been itching to take over the land of Freedonia, and the Sylvanian ambassador Trentino (Calhern) attempts to destroy the country bit by bit by hiring two spies to dig up dirt on Firefly, and further tries to implement and carry on with a revolution. The spies he appoints, Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo), are incompetent buffoons who wind up being unnecessary roadblocks and distractions, bringing trouble wherever they show up. This results in a never-ending slew of comedic possibilities, all working in the film's favor. Next to Rufus, the funniest character is Chicolini, the silent half of the spy duo, who appears in some of the film's most enjoyable segments. There are a number of scenes where Chicolini and Pinky obnoxiously harass a poor street vendor who wants nothing but a successful business. This results in the infamous scene where the three tirelessly exchange hats, and where Chicolini jumps into and rides the bucket of lemonade like a bicycle, disgusting the vendors' customers. The scene is simply hilarious, and I can't recall laughing harder to a scene in a comedy in recent years. But what makes Chicolini's character avoid insufferable schtick is his ability to perform physical comedy. His facial expressions are simply entrancing and his antics on par with his explosive personality. He's almost like Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean, but more shameless and rowdy. Chicolini has an intense and infectious form of likability, and he never comes off as a nuisance. Duck Soup was released in 1933, and was met with less than stellar box office numbers, causing Paramount to drop The Marx Brothers, among other issues. The most likely reason it took in a low amount of revenue is because of the subject matter. The film is highly cynical, sarcastic, and unapologetically rude. America was hitting the time of The Great Depression, among the beginning stages of World War II. It goes to show that people weren't interested in seeing a cheeky, satirical portrayal of government and politics. Thankfully, the film has gotten its proper respect over the years, and is often hailed as The Marx Brothers' best film. I also wouldn't hesitate to bill this as one of the funniest and smartest comedy films ever made. At least on my personal list. The film tackles a number of subjects, from politics, imperialism, government, outlandish rules, and society itself, and satirizes them to the point of utter disbelief and hilarity. In no way is the film mean-spirited or deliberately crude. This was before that became the standard in comedy. It always keeps a sunny, cheery disposition, right down to the final frame. Its bravery is astonishing, even to this day. How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? This is comedic and satirical filmmaking at its absolute finest. The Marx Brothers are clearly a treasure, under-appreciated in this day and age, and painfully overlooked in a time where politics and social issues plague our nation. Duck Soup is slapstick done right, with a great band of character actors, one-liners galore, and a simple and effective premise that goes very far, surpassing anyone's expectations of "another stupid comedy from the year one." NOTE: It's also interesting to note that Groucho goes on record saying that him and his three brothers were just "Jews trying to get laughs." He denies that the film covered the topics of government and politics purposefully, and that he believes people read too much into it. I guess I'll reword my previous question like so; "How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? And they don't even try?" Starring: Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, Zeppo Marx, Margaret Dumont, Louis Calhern, Raquel Torres, and Edgar Kennedy. Directed by: Leo McCarey.

    The last 15 minutes of Duck Soup, inside Groucho's command headquarters during the war with Sylvania, are the funniest 15 minutes in film history. Non stop verbal, physical and visual gags, puns and insults, and almost all of them hit the mark , and play well 80 years later. Aide to Groucho, who is shooting out the window - " But sir, you are shooting your own men. Groucho hands the aide a bill - "here's five dollars , keep it under your hat." Grouch takes the five dollars back and says "better yet, I'll keep it under my hat." Duck Soup is the best Marx Brothers film because it is the most cynical and anarchic of them all. Some of the jokes are dated beyond help, and make cultural references that today's generation simply will not understand or appreciate, but those last 15 minutes are enough in itself to make this one of the all time great comedies.

    These days "Duck Soup" is generally considered the best of the Marx brothers comedies. However, at the time of its original release, its poor reception was one of the contributing factors to the brothers' split from Paramount. It was also the last of their films to feature Zeppo, who never really stood out much due to his role as a straight man to his brothers' zany antics. In this movie Groucho plays Rufus T. Firefly, the newly appointed leader of the fictional country of Freedonia. Zeppo plays his secretary while Chico and Harpo team up as spies for the Sylvanian ambassador, who is attempting to incite a revolution. The brothers were all in good form for this picture and were joined by frequent comic foil Margaret Dumont. Louis Calhern was also effective as the villain of the piece. Verbal comedy is where the film shines and all of these individuals worked quite well together. On the other hand, I found that some of the physical comedy bits just went on too long. Future Oscar winner Leo McCarey directed the film and I have no complaints about his work here. For the most part, he avoided the staginess of the earlier films. The musical numbers are pretty well done, too, though I would have liked to have seen the brothers themselves show off their instrumental skills as they often did in their movies.

We are placed in the country of Freedonia, a small, corrupt, and bankrupt place that has struggled politically for many years. Mrs. Teasdale (Dumont) suggest they appoint Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) as the leader of the country, and see if he can get the country back on the route of prosperity. It's clear that his plans are radical, unsustainable, and virtually outlandish. The funny part is no one sees it that way. He says that anyone chewing gum will be pursued, and despite how absurd that idea is, no one scolds him. They are too smitten with his sunny and kind-hearted disposition. Perhaps that's how we are as people. While this is in the mix, the neighboring country of Sylvania has been itching to take over the land of Freedonia, and the Sylvanian ambassador Trentino (Calhern) attempts to destroy the country bit by bit by hiring two spies to dig up dirt on Firefly, and further tries to implement and carry on with a revolution. The spies he appoints, Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo), are incompetent buffoons who wind up being unnecessary roadblocks and distractions, bringing trouble wherever they show up. This results in a never-ending slew of comedic possibilities, all working in the film's favor. Next to Rufus, the funniest character is Chicolini, the silent half of the spy duo, who appears in some of the film's most enjoyable segments. There are a number of scenes where Chicolini and Pinky obnoxiously harass a poor street vendor who wants nothing but a successful business. This results in the infamous scene where the three tirelessly exchange hats, and where Chicolini jumps into and rides the bucket of lemonade like a bicycle, disgusting the vendors' customers. The scene is simply hilarious, and I can't recall laughing harder to a scene in a comedy in recent years. But what makes Chicolini's character avoid insufferable schtick is his ability to perform physical comedy. His facial expressions are simply entrancing and his antics on par with his explosive personality. He's almost like Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean, but more shameless and rowdy. Chicolini has an intense and infectious form of likability, and he never comes off as a nuisance. Duck Soup was released in 1933, and was met with less than stellar box office numbers, causing Paramount to drop The Marx Brothers, among other issues. The most likely reason it took in a low amount of revenue is because of the subject matter. The film is highly cynical, sarcastic, and unapologetically rude. America was hitting the time of The Great Depression, among the beginning stages of World War II. It goes to show that people weren't interested in seeing a cheeky, satirical portrayal of government and politics. Thankfully, the film has gotten its proper respect over the years, and is often hailed as The Marx Brothers' best film. I also wouldn't hesitate to bill this as one of the funniest and smartest comedy films ever made. At least on my personal list. The film tackles a number of subjects, from politics, imperialism, government, outlandish rules, and society itself, and satirizes them to the point of utter disbelief and hilarity. In no way is the film mean-spirited or deliberately crude. This was before that became the standard in comedy. It always keeps a sunny, cheery disposition, right down to the final frame. Its bravery is astonishing, even to this day. How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? This is comedic and satirical filmmaking at its absolute finest. The Marx Brothers are clearly a treasure, under-appreciated in this day and age, and painfully overlooked in a time where politics and social issues plague our nation. Duck Soup is slapstick done right, with a great band of character actors, one-liners galore, and a simple and effective premise that goes very far, surpassing anyone's expectations of "another stupid comedy from the year one." NOTE: It's also interesting to note that Groucho goes on record saying that him and his three brothers were just "Jews trying to get laughs." He denies that the film covered the topics of government and politics purposefully, and that he believes people read too much into it. I guess I'll reword my previous question like so; "How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? And they don't even try?" Starring: Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, Zeppo Marx, Margaret Dumont, Louis Calhern, Raquel Torres, and Edgar Kennedy. Directed by: Leo McCarey.

    The last 15 minutes of Duck Soup, inside Groucho's command headquarters during the war with Sylvania, are the funniest 15 minutes in film history. Non stop verbal, physical and visual gags, puns and insults, and almost all of them hit the mark , and play well 80 years later. Aide to Groucho, who is shooting out the window - " But sir, you are shooting your own men. Groucho hands the aide a bill - "here's five dollars , keep it under your hat." Grouch takes the five dollars back and says "better yet, I'll keep it under my hat." Duck Soup is the best Marx Brothers film because it is the most cynical and anarchic of them all. Some of the jokes are dated beyond help, and make cultural references that today's generation simply will not understand or appreciate, but those last 15 minutes are enough in itself to make this one of the all time great comedies.

    These days "Duck Soup" is generally considered the best of the Marx brothers comedies. However, at the time of its original release, its poor reception was one of the contributing factors to the brothers' split from Paramount. It was also the last of their films to feature Zeppo, who never really stood out much due to his role as a straight man to his brothers' zany antics. In this movie Groucho plays Rufus T. Firefly, the newly appointed leader of the fictional country of Freedonia. Zeppo plays his secretary while Chico and Harpo team up as spies for the Sylvanian ambassador, who is attempting to incite a revolution. The brothers were all in good form for this picture and were joined by frequent comic foil Margaret Dumont. Louis Calhern was also effective as the villain of the piece. Verbal comedy is where the film shines and all of these individuals worked quite well together. On the other hand, I found that some of the physical comedy bits just went on too long. Future Oscar winner Leo McCarey directed the film and I have no complaints about his work here. For the most part, he avoided the staginess of the earlier films. The musical numbers are pretty well done, too, though I would have liked to have seen the brothers themselves show off their instrumental skills as they often did in their movies. Ultimately, I consider this my second favourite Marx brothers comedy after "A Night at the Opera". There seem to be differing viewpoints on which one is superior. Personally, I find that this film's anarchic quality is endearing but it doesn't produce as cohesive an experience as their MGM productions that were soon to come.

    Just rewatched this classic Four Marx Brothers comedy on DVD. It has Groucho once again wooing Margaret Dumont while insulting her though she doesn't seem to notice. It has Chico and Harpo as peanut vendors also insulting Edgar Kennedy as a lemonade vendor including the "mixed hats" routine which director Leo McCarey probably invented for Laurel & Hardy back in the '20s when they all were at Hal Roach Studios. And it has Zeppo in his last screen role before switching to the other side of show business, here performing with his brothers in his only musical number with them. Oh, and then there's the iconic mirror sequence with Groucho and Chico and Harpo with the latter two dressing like the first one. In short, it has all the ingredients of perhaps the greatest of the Marx Brothers comedies. And while I enjoy the piano and harp solos of Chico and Harpo, respectively, the fact neither do their music here adds to the enjoyment though I guess something had to be done to the piano displayed here so Harpo decided to just pluck on the strings like his beloved instrument to satisfy some of his penchant for skill playing...

    This is among the oldest movies that I ever tried to watch. It is indeed a very classic stuff and I noticed that it is a very fast paced movie: I though that movies from 1930 would be very slow paced but this one is anything but that, it is full of very good jokes and fast paced delivery. I also found interesting to note that many of the jokes used in this movie became so iconic that I instantly recognized their use in several other media. The mirror joke, for instance, is perhaps one of the greatest moments of this film and has so great an influence that every comedy series today, such as Family Guy, still uses the same joke. It was truly the work of genius to devise such a joke at the time.

    Without a silly romantic subplot to get in their way, or serious musical interludes, the audience is treated to 100% pure Marxian chaos. The humor remains as fresh as ever. Who can hear Grouch sing his plans for leaving Fredonia worse than he found it without thinking of a certain former president. It also features one of their most famous scenes - the mirror scene. Interesting that a comedy group known for their punchlines would be most remembered for a scene that takes place in complete silence. This also marks the last time all four brothers appeared in on screen together. Check out my fill review http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/02/25/duck-soup/

    Greetings again from the darkness. It's been 20-25 years since I last watched this one, so catching it on the big screen was a real treat. I laughed at almost every scene, as this is the Marx Brothers best combination of quips, puns, political satire and physical sight gags. They are in prime form and for the first and only time, are directed by a real director ... Leo McCarey (also known for An Affair to Remember, and Going My Way). The script is from Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, with additional dialogue by the great Arthur Sheekman. Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo star together for the last time, as Zeppo decided to join brother Gummo on the business side. Groucho plays Rufus T Firefly who is (somehow) named as the new leader of Freedonia, the bankrupt country backed by millionaire widow Mrs Teasdale (played by Margaret Dumont). A childish spat between Firefly and the ambassador of Sylvania lead the two countries to war. Of course, in between, there is a huge musical production sequence and too many funny gags to keep track of. The film is recognized as the first political satire film and was released just 3 years after the death of silent films. Much of the film is spent as commentary on the absurdity of war and ego involved in most conflicts. A couple of the iconic sight gags include the famous "mirror" scene with Groucho and Harpo, and the hilarious "hat scene" with Chico, Harpo and silent film star Edgar Kennedy (as a lemonade vendor). There is also one of the most bizarre early special effects (a tattoo on Harpo's chest) and a Dallas, Texas joke that generated applause from the audience. The film even pokes fun at the Hays Code (morality censorship) with a shot of a pair of men's shoes, a pair of women's shoes, and a set of horseshoes, and then a quick cut to twin beds and an odd sleeping arrangement. The film came out at a time when much cynicism existed toward the Great War and the Depression was still a fact of life in the U.S. Because of that, the film may be easier for us to watch now than it was at the time of its release. Even the Freedonia anthem, which is played several times throughout, is a spoof on the Star Spangled banner with it's only line being "Hail Hail Freedonia, land of the brave and free". Support work is also provided by Louis Calhern, but it's Margaret Dumont who never ceases to amaze. A consistent presence in Marx Brother films, she is the epitome of the "comedy straight man". How she ever played her role seriously given the Marx Brothers hijinks is beyond belief. She even gets to flash her classically trained singing voice, though it provides a flying fruit ending. The Marx Brothers made 13 movies and this was their fifth, and probably best. The five brothers only appeared together on screen one time ... on a TV talk show in 1957. Their vaudeville and stage act continued to be the basis for their films, and was undoubtedly a factor in their incredible comedic timing. While it is understandable that the Marx Brothers humor may not be to every person's taste, it is impossible to ignore their impact on film comedy. Hail Hail Freedonia!!

    A big glass eliminate. "Duck Soup" is often hysterical madcap comedy, showcasing the legendary Marx Brothers unit to great effect. The songs are catchy, the energy incredible, and the delivery breathless. Many of the comedies of today have got nothing on this level of invention, satirical detail, and genuine belly laughs. The irrepressible Groucho is Rufus T. Firefly, elevated to the position of president / dictator of tiny, financially strapped country Freedonia. Rufus's cheeky and sardonic ways only serve to create problems, not the least of which is rubbing the leader of the neighbouring country Sylvania the wrong way. The one liners come fast and furious, and the cast plays the entire thing to perfection. Among the many set pieces are the repeated scuffles Harpo and Chico, as spies Pinky and Chicolini, get into with a street vendor, the sight of three Grouchos running about (as Pinky and Chicolini masquerade as Rufus in order to get their hands on valuable battle plans), and of course the one sequence everybody remembers, the mirror sequence, which is old style vaudeville at its best. Margaret Dumont is a delight in her perpetual "straight woman" role, often uttering her lines in a priceless sing song style. It's too bad that this would be the last time that Zeppo would act with his brothers, as he's given a fair amount to do here, and one of the biggest joys is seeing the brothers performing together near the end. Harpo gets some big laughs with his silent comedy; the moment where he's showing off his tattoos is a riot. Clocking in at a tight 69 minutes, the movie maintains a fine forward momentum and builds towards a priceless finale where, among other things, Rufus fires on his own soldiers! Overall this is an absolute must for any comedy fan, as it starts brightly and keeps coming up with enough witty exchanges to make for very pleasant viewing. Nine out of 10.

    This is mayhem, and, chaos, and nutty, and havoc, and very funny. It proves once and for all that Duck Soup, if it is made by a great chef.......tastes wonderful. Made in 1933, this Marx Brothers classic is the funniest movie in motion picture history. Groucho delivers his one liners with machine gun precision.....and always hits the target. There will simply NEVER be any "funny guy" who will even come close to The Grouch. Its a fact.....during the past 79 years no comedy has bettered this. The last 25 years have been really bad....badly written, terribly acted....and NOT funny. Its all so pretentious, today. Will Ferrell ?? are we kidding ?? The guy is awful. And "the others" are only marginally better. Writers should remember a simple rule..........people who go to the cinema to see a comedy........expect to laugh.

    "Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together. After one taste, you'll duck soup for the rest of your life." - Groucho Marx's explanation for the title of Duck Soup. Duck Soup is an unprecedented comedy of wit and satire, with its range of material and jokes reaching a rare amount of diversity. The film is short, whimsical, and delightfully anarchic at only sixty-eight minutes, and it seems after every ten minutes you need a break to sometimes decipher what just happened. Things progress at a rapid fire pace, and the end feels like about twenty-five minutes or so got lost in a blaze. This sounds like how I'd comment on a bad film, but Duck Soup uses these tactics in its favor. Its main benefit is that the brothers wanted to do nothing more than make an enjoyable comedy, but they accidentally succeeded in making one of the most cynical and brutally honest political satires in a blue moon. It's very rare that I award a comedy a perfect rating, but Duck Soup has proved to be more than meets the eye in substance, character-acting, and overall, look and feel. We are placed in the country of Freedonia, a small, corrupt, and bankrupt place that has struggled politically for many years. Mrs. Teasdale (Dumont) suggest they appoint Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) as the leader of the country, and see if he can get the country back on the route of prosperity. It's clear that his plans are radical, unsustainable, and virtually outlandish. The funny part is no one sees it that way. He says that anyone chewing gum will be pursued, and despite how absurd that idea is, no one scolds him. They are too smitten with his sunny and kind-hearted disposition. Perhaps that's how we are as people. While this is in the mix, the neighboring country of Sylvania has been itching to take over the land of Freedonia, and the Sylvanian ambassador Trentino (Calhern) attempts to destroy the country bit by bit by hiring two spies to dig up dirt on Firefly, and further tries to implement and carry on with a revolution. The spies he appoints, Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo), are incompetent buffoons who wind up being unnecessary roadblocks and distractions, bringing trouble wherever they show up. This results in a never-ending slew of comedic possibilities, all working in the film's favor. Next to Rufus, the funniest character is Chicolini, the silent half of the spy duo, who appears in some of the film's most enjoyable segments. There are a number of scenes where Chicolini and Pinky obnoxiously harass a poor street vendor who wants nothing but a successful business. This results in the infamous scene where the three tirelessly exchange hats, and where Chicolini jumps into and rides the bucket of lemonade like a bicycle, disgusting the vendors' customers. The scene is simply hilarious, and I can't recall laughing harder to a scene in a comedy in recent years. But what makes Chicolini's character avoid insufferable schtick is his ability to perform physical comedy.

    Greetings again from the darkness. It's been 20-25 years since I last watched this one, so catching it on the big screen was a real treat. I laughed at almost every scene, as this is the Marx Brothers best combination of quips, puns, political satire and physical sight gags. They are in prime form and for the first and only time, are directed by a real director ... Leo McCarey (also known for An Affair to Remember, and Going My Way). The script is from Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, with additional dialogue by the great Arthur Sheekman. Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo star together for the last time, as Zeppo decided to join brother Gummo on the business side. Groucho plays Rufus T Firefly who is (somehow) named as the new leader of Freedonia, the bankrupt country backed by millionaire widow Mrs Teasdale (played by Margaret Dumont). A childish spat between Firefly and the ambassador of Sylvania lead the two countries to war. Of course, in between, there is a huge musical production sequence and too many funny gags to keep track of. The film is recognized as the first political satire film and was released just 3 years after the death of silent films. Much of the film is spent as commentary on the absurdity of war and ego involved in most conflicts. A couple of the iconic sight gags include the famous "mirror" scene with Groucho and Harpo, and the hilarious "hat scene" with Chico, Harpo and silent film star Edgar Kennedy (as a lemonade vendor). There is also one of the most bizarre early special effects (a tattoo on Harpo's chest) and a Dallas, Texas joke that generated applause from the audience. The film even pokes fun at the Hays Code (morality censorship) with a shot of a pair of men's shoes, a pair of women's shoes, and a set of horseshoes, and then a quick cut to twin beds and an odd sleeping arrangement. The film came out at a time when much cynicism existed toward the Great War and the Depression was still a fact of life in the U.S. Because of that, the film may be easier for us to watch now than it was at the time of its release. Even the Freedonia anthem, which is played several times throughout, is a spoof on the Star Spangled banner with it's only line being "Hail Hail Freedonia, land of the brave and free". Support work is also provided by Louis Calhern, but it's Margaret Dumont who never ceases to amaze. A consistent presence in Marx Brother films, she is the epitome of the "comedy straight man". How she ever played her role seriously given the Marx Brothers hijinks is beyond belief. She even gets to flash her classically trained singing voice, though it provides a flying fruit ending. The Marx Brothers made 13 movies and this was their fifth, and probably best. The five brothers only appeared together on screen one time ... on a TV talk show in 1957. Their vaudeville and stage act continued to be the basis for their films, and was undoubtedly a factor in their incredible comedic timing. While it is understandable that the Marx Brothers humor may not be to every person's taste, it is impossible to ignore their impact on film comedy. Hail Hail Freedonia!!

    A big glass eliminate. "Duck Soup" is often hysterical madcap comedy, showcasing the legendary Marx Brothers unit to great effect. The songs are catchy, the energy incredible, and the delivery breathless. Many of the comedies of today have got nothing on this level of invention, satirical detail, and genuine belly laughs. The irrepressible Groucho is Rufus T. Firefly, elevated to the position of president / dictator of tiny, financially strapped country Freedonia. Rufus's cheeky and sardonic ways only serve to create problems, not the least of which is rubbing the leader of the neighbouring country Sylvania the wrong way. The one liners come fast and furious, and the cast plays the entire thing to perfection. Among the many set pieces are the repeated scuffles Harpo and Chico, as spies Pinky and Chicolini, get into with a street vendor, the sight of three Grouchos running about (as Pinky and Chicolini masquerade as Rufus in order to get their hands on valuable battle plans), and of course the one sequence everybody remembers, the mirror sequence, which is old style vaudeville at its best. Margaret Dumont is a delight in her perpetual "straight woman" role, often uttering her lines in a priceless sing song style. It's too bad that this would be the last time that Zeppo would act with his brothers, as he's given a fair amount to do here, and one of the biggest joys is seeing the brothers performing together near the end. Harpo gets some big laughs with his silent comedy; the moment where he's showing off his tattoos is a riot. Clocking in at a tight 69 minutes, the movie maintains a fine forward momentum and builds towards a priceless finale where, among other things, Rufus fires on his own soldiers! Overall this is an absolute must for any comedy fan, as it starts brightly and keeps coming up with enough witty exchanges to make for very pleasant viewing. Nine out of 10.

    This is mayhem, and, chaos, and nutty, and havoc, and very funny. It proves once and for all that Duck Soup, if it is made by a great chef.......tastes wonderful. Made in 1933, this Marx Brothers classic is the funniest movie in motion picture history. Groucho delivers his one liners with machine gun precision.....and always hits the target. There will simply NEVER be any "funny guy" who will even come close to The Grouch. Its a fact.....during the past 79 years no comedy has bettered this. The last 25 years have been really bad....badly written, terribly acted....and NOT funny. Its all so pretentious, today. Will Ferrell ?? are we kidding ?? The guy is awful. And "the others" are only marginally better. Writers should remember a simple rule..........people who go to the cinema to see a comedy........expect to laugh.

    "Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together. After one taste, you'll duck soup for the rest of your life." - Groucho Marx's explanation for the title of Duck Soup. Duck Soup is an unprecedented comedy of wit and satire, with its range of material and jokes reaching a rare amount of diversity. The film is short, whimsical, and delightfully anarchic at only sixty-eight minutes, and it seems after every ten minutes you need a break to sometimes decipher what just happened. Things progress at a rapid fire pace, and the end feels like about twenty-five minutes or so got lost in a blaze. This sounds like how I'd comment on a bad film, but Duck Soup uses these tactics in its favor. Its main benefit is that the brothers wanted to do nothing more than make an enjoyable comedy, but they accidentally succeeded in making one of the most cynical and brutally honest political satires in a blue moon. It's very rare that I award a comedy a perfect rating, but Duck Soup has proved to be more than meets the eye in substance, character-acting, and overall, look and feel. We are placed in the country of Freedonia, a small, corrupt, and bankrupt place that has struggled politically for many years. Mrs. Teasdale (Dumont) suggest they appoint Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) as the leader of the country, and see if he can get the country back on the route of prosperity. It's clear that his plans are radical, unsustainable, and virtually outlandish. The funny part is no one sees it that way. He says that anyone chewing gum will be pursued, and despite how absurd that idea is, no one scolds him. They are too smitten with his sunny and kind-hearted disposition. Perhaps that's how we are as people. While this is in the mix, the neighboring country of Sylvania has been itching to take over the land of Freedonia, and the Sylvanian ambassador Trentino (Calhern) attempts to destroy the country bit by bit by hiring two spies to dig up dirt on Firefly, and further tries to implement and carry on with a revolution. The spies he appoints, Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo), are incompetent buffoons who wind up being unnecessary roadblocks and distractions, bringing trouble wherever they show up. This results in a never-ending slew of comedic possibilities, all working in the film's favor. Next to Rufus, the funniest character is Chicolini, the silent half of the spy duo, who appears in some of the film's most enjoyable segments. There are a number of scenes where Chicolini and Pinky obnoxiously harass a poor street vendor who wants nothing but a successful business. This results in the infamous scene where the three tirelessly exchange hats, and where Chicolini jumps into and rides the bucket of lemonade like a bicycle, disgusting the vendors' customers. The scene is simply hilarious, and I can't recall laughing harder to a scene in a comedy in recent years. But what makes Chicolini's character avoid insufferable schtick is his ability to perform physical comedy. His facial expressions are simply entrancing and his antics on par with his explosive personality. He's almost like Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean, but more shameless and rowdy. Chicolini has an intense and infectious form of likability, and he never comes off as a nuisance. Duck Soup was released in 1933, and was met with less than stellar box office numbers, causing Paramount to drop The Marx Brothers, among other issues. The most likely reason it took in a low amount of revenue is because of the subject matter. The film is highly cynical, sarcastic, and unapologetically rude. America was hitting the time of The Great Depression, among the beginning stages of World War II. It goes to show that people weren't interested in seeing a cheeky, satirical portrayal of government and politics. Thankfully, the film has gotten its proper respect over the years, and is often hailed as The Marx Brothers' best film. I also wouldn't hesitate to bill this as one of the funniest and smartest comedy films ever made. At least on my personal list. The film tackles a number of subjects, from politics, imperialism, government, outlandish rules, and society itself, and satirizes them to the point of utter disbelief and hilarity. In no way is the film mean-spirited or deliberately crude. This was before that became the standard in comedy. It always keeps a sunny, cheery disposition, right down to the final frame. Its bravery is astonishing, even to this day. How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? This is comedic and satirical filmmaking at its absolute finest. The Marx Brothers are clearly a treasure, under-appreciated in this day and age, and painfully overlooked in a time where politics and social issues plague our nation. Duck Soup is slapstick done right, with a great band of character actors, one-liners galore, and a simple and effective premise that goes very far, surpassing anyone's expectations of "another stupid comedy from the year one." NOTE: It's also interesting to note that Groucho goes on record saying that him and his three brothers were just "Jews trying to get laughs." He denies that the film covered the topics of government and politics purposefully, and that he believes people read too much into it. I guess I'll reword my previous question like so; "How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? And they don't even try?" Starring: Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, Zeppo Marx, Margaret Dumont, Louis Calhern, Raquel Torres, and Edgar Kennedy. Directed by: Leo McCarey.

    The last 15 minutes of Duck Soup, inside Groucho's command headquarters during the war with Sylvania, are the funniest 15 minutes in film history. Non stop verbal, physical and visual gags, puns and insults, and almost all of them hit the mark , and play well 80 years later. Aide to Groucho, who is shooting out the window - " But sir, you are shooting your own men. Groucho hands the aide a bill - "here's five dollars , keep it under your hat." Grouch takes the five dollars back and says "better yet, I'll keep it under my hat." Duck Soup is the best Marx Brothers film because it is the most cynical and anarchic of them all. Some of the jokes are dated beyond help, and make cultural references that today's generation simply will not understand or appreciate, but those last 15 minutes are enough in itself to make this one of the all time great comedies.

    These days "Duck Soup" is generally considered the best of the Marx brothers comedies. However, at the time of its original release, its poor reception was one of the contributing factors to the brothers' split from Paramount. It was also the last of their films to feature Zeppo, who never really stood out much due to his role as a straight man to his brothers' zany antics. In this movie Groucho plays Rufus T. Firefly, the newly appointed leader of the fictional country of Freedonia. Zeppo plays his secretary while Chico and Harpo team up as spies for the Sylvanian ambassador, who is attempting to incite a revolution. The brothers were all in good form for this picture and were joined by frequent comic foil Margaret Dumont. Louis Calhern was also effective as the villain of the piece. Verbal comedy is where the film shines and all of these individuals worked quite well together. On the other hand, I found that some of the physical comedy bits just went on too long. Future Oscar winner Leo McCarey directed the film and I have no complaints about his work here. For the most part, he avoided the staginess of the earlier films. The musical numbers are pretty well done, too, though I would have liked to have seen the brothers themselves show off their instrumental skills as they often did in their movies. Ultimately, I consider this my second favourite Marx brothers comedy after "A Night at the Opera". There seem to be differing viewpoints on which one is superior. Personally, I find that this film's anarchic quality is endearing but it doesn't produce as cohesive an experience as their MGM productions that were soon to come.

    Just rewatched this classic Four Marx Brothers comedy on DVD. It has Groucho once again wooing Margaret Dumont while insulting her though she doesn't seem to notice. It has Chico and Harpo as peanut vendors also insulting Edgar Kennedy as a lemonade vendor including the "mixed hats" routine which director Leo McCarey probably invented for Laurel & Hardy back in the '20s when they all were at Hal Roach Studios. And it has Zeppo in his last screen role before switching to the other side of show business, here performing with his brothers in his only musical number with them. Oh, and then there's the iconic mirror sequence with Groucho and Chico and Harpo with the latter two dressing like the first one. In short, it has all the ingredients of perhaps the greatest of the Marx Brothers comedies. And while I enjoy the piano and harp solos of Chico and Harpo, respectively, the fact neither do their music here adds to the enjoyment though I guess something had to be done to the piano displayed here so Harpo decided to just pluck on the strings like his beloved instrument to satisfy some of his penchant for skill playing...

    This is among the oldest movies that I ever tried to watch. It is indeed a very classic stuff and I noticed that it is a very fast paced movie: I though that movies from 1930 would be very slow paced but this one is anything but that, it is full of very good jokes and fast paced delivery. I also found interesting to note that many of the jokes used in this movie became so iconic that I instantly recognized their use in several other media. The mirror joke, for instance, is perhaps one of the greatest moments of this film and has so great an influence that every comedy series today, such as Family Guy, still uses the same joke. It was truly the work of genius to devise such a joke at the time.

    Without a silly romantic subplot to get in their way, or serious musical interludes, the audience is treated to 100% pure Marxian chaos. The humor remains as fresh as ever. Who can hear Grouch sing his plans for leaving Fredonia worse than he found it without thinking of a certain former president. It also features one of their most famous scenes - the mirror scene. Interesting that a comedy group known for their punchlines would be most remembered for a scene that takes place in complete silence. This also marks the last time all four brothers appeared in on screen together. Check out my fill review http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/02/25/duck-soup/

    The last 15 minutes of Duck Soup, inside Groucho's command headquarters during the war with Sylvania, are the funniest 15 minutes in film history. Non stop verbal, physical and visual gags, puns and insults, and almost all of them hit the mark , and play well 80 years later. Aide to Groucho, who is shooting out the window - " But sir, you are shooting your own men. Groucho hands the aide a bill - "here's five dollars , keep it under your hat." Grouch takes the five dollars back and says "better yet, I'll keep it under my hat." Duck Soup is the best Marx Brothers film because it is the most cynical and anarchic of them all. Some of the jokes are dated beyond help, and make cultural references that today's generation simply will not understand or appreciate, but those last 15 minutes are enough in itself to make this one of the all time great comedies.

    These days "Duck Soup" is generally considered the best of the Marx brothers comedies. However, at the time of its original release, its poor reception was one of the contributing factors to the brothers' split from Paramount. It was also the last of their films to feature Zeppo, who never really stood out much due to his role as a straight man to his brothers' zany antics. In this movie Groucho plays Rufus T. Firefly, the newly appointed leader of the fictional country of Freedonia. Zeppo plays his secretary while Chico and Harpo team up as spies for the Sylvanian ambassador, who is attempting to incite a revolution. The brothers were all in good form for this picture and were joined by frequent comic foil Margaret Dumont. Louis Calhern was also effective as the villain of the piece. Verbal comedy is where the film shines and all of these individuals worked quite well together. On the other hand, I found that some of the physical comedy bits just went on too long. Future Oscar winner Leo McCarey directed the film and I have no complaints about his work here. For the most part, he avoided the staginess of the earlier films. The musical numbers are pretty well done, too, though I would have liked to have seen the brothers themselves show off their instrumental skills as they often did in their movies. Ultimately, I consider this my second favourite Marx brothers comedy after "A Night at the Opera". There seem to be differing viewpoints on which one is superior. Personally, I find that this film's anarchic quality is endearing but it doesn't produce as cohesive an experience as their MGM productions that were soon to come.

    Just rewatched this classic Four Marx Brothers comedy on DVD. It has Groucho once again wooing Margaret Dumont while insulting her though she doesn't seem to notice. It has Chico and Harpo as peanut vendors also insulting Edgar Kennedy as a lemonade vendor including the "mixed hats" routine which director Leo McCarey probably invented for Laurel & Hardy back in the '20s when they all were at Hal Roach Studios. And it has Zeppo in his last screen role before switching to the other side of show business, here performing with his brothers in his only musical number with them. Oh, and then there's the iconic mirror sequence with Groucho and Chico and Harpo with the latter two dressing like the first one. In short, it has all the ingredients of perhaps the greatest of the Marx Brothers comedies. And while I enjoy the piano and harp solos of Chico and Harpo, respectively, the fact neither do their music here adds to the enjoyment though I guess something had to be done to the piano displayed here so Harpo decided to just pluck on the strings like his beloved instrument to satisfy some of his penchant for skill playing...

    This is among the oldest movies that I ever tried to watch. It is indeed a very classic stuff and I noticed that it is a very fast paced movie: I though that movies from 1930 would be very slow paced but this one is anything but that, it is full of very good jokes and fast paced delivery. I also found interesting to note that many of the jokes used in this movie became so iconic that I instantly recognized their use in several other media. The mirror joke, for instance, is perhaps one of the greatest moments of this film and has so great an influence that every comedy series today, such as Family Guy, still uses the same joke. It was truly the work of genius to devise such a joke at the time.

    Without a silly romantic subplot to get in their way, or serious musical interludes, the audience is treated to 100% pure Marxian chaos. The humor remains as fresh as ever. Who can hear Grouch sing his plans for leaving Fredonia worse than he found it without thinking of a certain former president. It also features one of their most famous scenes - the mirror scene. Interesting that a comedy group known for their punchlines would be most remembered for a scene that takes place in complete silence. This also marks the last time all four brothers appeared in on screen together. Check out my fill review http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/02/25/duck-soup/

    Greetings again from the darkness. It's been 20-25 years since I last watched this one, so catching it on the big screen was a real treat. I laughed at almost every scene, as this is the Marx Brothers best combination of quips, puns, political satire and physical sight gags. They are in prime form and for the first and only time, are directed by a real director ... Leo McCarey (also known for An Affair to Remember, and Going My Way). The script is from Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, with additional dialogue by the great Arthur Sheekman. Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo star together for the last time, as Zeppo decided to join brother Gummo on the business side. Groucho plays Rufus T Firefly who is (somehow) named as the new leader of Freedonia, the bankrupt country backed by millionaire widow Mrs Teasdale (played by Margaret Dumont). A childish spat between Firefly and the ambassador of Sylvania lead the two countries to war. Of course, in between, there is a huge musical production sequence and too many funny gags to keep track of. The film is recognized as the first political satire film and was released just 3 years after the death of silent films. Much of the film is spent as commentary on the absurdity of war and ego involved in most conflicts. A couple of the iconic sight gags include the famous "mirror" scene with Groucho and Harpo, and the hilarious "hat scene" with Chico, Harpo and silent film star Edgar Kennedy (as a lemonade vendor). There is also one of the most bizarre early special effects (a tattoo on Harpo's chest) and a Dallas, Texas joke that generated applause from the audience. The film even pokes fun at the Hays Code (morality censorship) with a shot of a pair of men's shoes, a pair of women's shoes, and a set of horseshoes, and then a quick cut to twin beds and an odd sleeping arrangement. The film came out at a time when much cynicism existed toward the Great War and the Depression was still a fact of life in the U.S. Because of that, the film may be easier for us to watch now than it was at the time of its release. Even the Freedonia anthem, which is played several times throughout, is a spoof on the Star Spangled banner with it's only line being "Hail Hail Freedonia, land of the brave and free". Support work is also provided by Louis Calhern, but it's Margaret Dumont who never ceases to amaze. A consistent presence in Marx Brother films, she is the epitome of the "comedy straight man". How she ever played her role seriously given the Marx Brothers hijinks is beyond belief. She even gets to flash her classically trained singing voice, though it provides a flying fruit ending. The Marx Brothers made 13 movies and this was their fifth, and probably best. The five brothers only appeared together on screen one time ... on a TV talk show in 1957. Their vaudeville and stage act continued to be the basis for their films, and was undoubtedly a factor in their incredible comedic timing. While it is understandable that the Marx Brothers humor may not be to every person's taste, it is impossible to ignore their impact on film comedy. Hail Hail Freedonia!!

    A big glass eliminate. "Duck Soup" is often hysterical madcap comedy, showcasing the legendary Marx Brothers unit to great effect. The songs are catchy, the energy incredible, and the delivery breathless. Many of the comedies of today have got nothing on this level of invention, satirical detail, and genuine belly laughs. The irrepressible Groucho is Rufus T. Firefly, elevated to the position of president / dictator of tiny, financially strapped country Freedonia. Rufus's cheeky and sardonic ways only serve to create problems, not the least of which is rubbing the leader of the neighbouring country Sylvania the wrong way. The one liners come fast and furious, and the cast plays the entire thing to perfection. Among the many set pieces are the repeated scuffles Harpo and Chico, as spies Pinky and Chicolini, get into with a street vendor, the sight of three Grouchos running about (as Pinky and Chicolini masquerade as Rufus in order to get their hands on valuable battle plans), and of course the one sequence everybody remembers, the mirror sequence, which is old style vaudeville at its best. Margaret Dumont is a delight in her perpetual "straight woman" role, often uttering her lines in a priceless sing song style. It's too bad that this would be the last time that Zeppo would act with his brothers, as he's given a fair amount to do here, and one of the biggest joys is seeing the brothers performing together near the end. Harpo gets some big laughs with his silent comedy; the moment where he's showing off his tattoos is a riot. Clocking in at a tight 69 minutes, the movie maintains a fine forward momentum and builds towards a priceless finale where, among other things, Rufus fires on his own soldiers! Overall this is an absolute must for any comedy fan, as it starts brightly and keeps coming up with enough witty exchanges to make for very pleasant viewing. Nine out of 10.

    This is mayhem, and, chaos, and nutty, and havoc, and very funny. It proves once and for all that Duck Soup, if it is made by a great chef.......tastes wonderful. Made in 1933, this Marx Brothers classic is the funniest movie in motion picture history. Groucho delivers his one liners with machine gun precision.....and always hits the target. There will simply NEVER be any "funny guy" who will even come close to The Grouch. Its a fact.....during the past 79 years no comedy has bettered this. The last 25 years have been really bad....badly written, terribly acted....and NOT funny. Its all so pretentious, today. Will Ferrell ?? are we kidding ?? The guy is awful. And "the others" are only marginally better. Writers should remember a simple rule..........people who go to the cinema to see a comedy........expect to laugh.

    "Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together. After one taste, you'll duck soup for the rest of your life." - Groucho Marx's explanation for the title of Duck Soup. Duck Soup is an unprecedented comedy of wit and satire, with its range of material and jokes reaching a rare amount of diversity. The film is short, whimsical, and delightfully anarchic at only sixty-eight minutes, and it seems after every ten minutes you need a break to sometimes decipher what just happened. Things progress at a rapid fire pace, and the end feels like about twenty-five minutes or so got lost in a blaze. This sounds like how I'd comment on a bad film, but Duck Soup uses these tactics in its favor. Its main benefit is that the brothers wanted to do nothing more than make an enjoyable comedy, but they accidentally succeeded in making one of the most cynical and brutally honest political satires in a blue moon. It's very rare that I award a comedy a perfect rating, but Duck Soup has proved to be more than meets the eye in substance, character-acting, and overall, look and feel. We are placed in the country of Freedonia, a small, corrupt, and bankrupt place that has struggled politically for many years. Mrs. Teasdale (Dumont) suggest they appoint Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) as the leader of the country, and see if he can get the country back on the route of prosperity. It's clear that his plans are radical, unsustainable, and virtually outlandish. The funny part is no one sees it that way. He says that anyone chewing gum will be pursued, and despite how absurd that idea is, no one scolds him. They are too smitten with his sunny and kind-hearted disposition. Perhaps that's how we are as people. While this is in the mix, the neighboring country of Sylvania has been itching to take over the land of Freedonia, and the Sylvanian ambassador Trentino (Calhern) attempts to destroy the country bit by bit by hiring two spies to dig up dirt on Firefly, and further tries to implement and carry on with a revolution. The spies he appoints, Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo), are incompetent buffoons who wind up being unnecessary roadblocks and distractions, bringing trouble wherever they show up. This results in a never-ending slew of comedic possibilities, all working in the film's favor. Next to Rufus, the funniest character is Chicolini, the silent half of the spy duo, who appears in some of the film's most enjoyable segments. There are a number of scenes where Chicolini and Pinky obnoxiously harass a poor street vendor who wants nothing but a successful business. This results in the infamous scene where the three tirelessly exchange hats, and where Chicolini jumps into and rides the bucket of lemonade like a bicycle, disgusting the vendors' customers. The scene is simply hilarious, and I can't recall laughing harder to a scene in a comedy in recent years. But what makes Chicolini's character avoid insufferable schtick is his ability to perform physical comedy. His facial expressions are simply entrancing and his antics on par with his explosive personality. He's almost like Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean, but more shameless and rowdy. Chicolini has an intense and infectious form of likability, and he never comes off as a nuisance. Duck Soup was released in 1933, and was met with less than stellar box office numbers, causing Paramount to drop The Marx Brothers, among other issues. The most likely reason it took in a low amount of revenue is because of the subject matter. The film is highly cynical, sarcastic, and unapologetically rude. America was hitting the time of The Great Depression, among the beginning stages of World War II. It goes to show that people weren't interested in seeing a cheeky, satirical portrayal of government and politics. Thankfully, the film has gotten its proper respect over the years, and is often hailed as The Marx Brothers' best film. I also wouldn't hesitate to bill this as one of the funniest and smartest comedy films ever made. At least on my personal list. The film tackles a number of subjects, from politics, imperialism, government, outlandish rules, and society itself, and satirizes them to the point of utter disbelief and hilarity. In no way is the film mean-spirited or deliberately crude. This was before that became the standard in comedy. It always keeps a sunny, cheery disposition, right down to the final frame. Its bravery is astonishing, even to this day. How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? This is comedic and satirical filmmaking at its absolute finest. The Marx Brothers are clearly a treasure, under-appreciated in this day and age, and painfully overlooked in a time where politics and social issues plague our nation. Duck Soup is slapstick done right, with a great band of character actors, one-liners galore, and a simple and effective premise that goes very far, surpassing anyone's expectations of "another stupid comedy from the year one." NOTE: It's also interesting to note that Groucho goes on record saying that him and his three brothers were just "Jews trying to get laughs." He denies that the film covered the topics of government and politics purposefully, and that he believes people read too much into it. I guess I'll reword my previous question like so; "How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? And they don't even try?" Starring: Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, Zeppo Marx, Margaret Dumont, Louis Calhern, Raquel Torres, and Edgar Kennedy. Directed by: Leo McCarey.

It's too bad that this would be the last time that Zeppo would act with his brothers, as he's given a fair amount to do here, and one of the biggest joys is seeing the brothers performing together near the end. Harpo gets some big laughs with his silent comedy; the moment where he's showing off his tattoos is a riot. Clocking in at a tight 69 minutes, the movie maintains a fine forward momentum and builds towards a priceless finale where, among other things, Rufus fires on his own soldiers! Overall this is an absolute must for any comedy fan, as it starts brightly and keeps coming up with enough witty exchanges to make for very pleasant viewing. Nine out of 10.

    This is mayhem, and, chaos, and nutty, and havoc, and very funny. It proves once and for all that Duck Soup, if it is made by a great chef.......tastes wonderful. Made in 1933, this Marx Brothers classic is the funniest movie in motion picture history. Groucho delivers his one liners with machine gun precision.....and always hits the target. There will simply NEVER be any "funny guy" who will even come close to The Grouch. Its a fact.....during the past 79 years no comedy has bettered this. The last 25 years have been really bad....badly written, terribly acted....and NOT funny. Its all so pretentious, today. Will Ferrell ?? are we kidding ?? The guy is awful. And "the others" are only marginally better. Writers should remember a simple rule..........people who go to the cinema to see a comedy........expect to laugh.

    "Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together. After one taste, you'll duck soup for the rest of your life." - Groucho Marx's explanation for the title of Duck Soup. Duck Soup is an unprecedented comedy of wit and satire, with its range of material and jokes reaching a rare amount of diversity. The film is short, whimsical, and delightfully anarchic at only sixty-eight minutes, and it seems after every ten minutes you need a break to sometimes decipher what just happened. Things progress at a rapid fire pace, and the end feels like about twenty-five minutes or so got lost in a blaze. This sounds like how I'd comment on a bad film, but Duck Soup uses these tactics in its favor. Its main benefit is that the brothers wanted to do nothing more than make an enjoyable comedy, but they accidentally succeeded in making one of the most cynical and brutally honest political satires in a blue moon. It's very rare that I award a comedy a perfect rating, but Duck Soup has proved to be more than meets the eye in substance, character-acting, and overall, look and feel. We are placed in the country of Freedonia, a small, corrupt, and bankrupt place that has struggled politically for many years. Mrs. Teasdale (Dumont) suggest they appoint Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) as the leader of the country, and see if he can get the country back on the route of prosperity. It's clear that his plans are radical, unsustainable, and virtually outlandish. The funny part is no one sees it that way. He says that anyone chewing gum will be pursued, and despite how absurd that idea is, no one scolds him. They are too smitten with his sunny and kind-hearted disposition. Perhaps that's how we are as people. While this is in the mix, the neighboring country of Sylvania has been itching to take over the land of Freedonia, and the Sylvanian ambassador Trentino (Calhern) attempts to destroy the country bit by bit by hiring two spies to dig up dirt on Firefly, and further tries to implement and carry on with a revolution. The spies he appoints, Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo), are incompetent buffoons who wind up being unnecessary roadblocks and distractions, bringing trouble wherever they show up. This results in a never-ending slew of comedic possibilities, all working in the film's favor. Next to Rufus, the funniest character is Chicolini, the silent half of the spy duo, who appears in some of the film's most enjoyable segments. There are a number of scenes where Chicolini and Pinky obnoxiously harass a poor street vendor who wants nothing but a successful business. This results in the infamous scene where the three tirelessly exchange hats, and where Chicolini jumps into and rides the bucket of lemonade like a bicycle, disgusting the vendors' customers. The scene is simply hilarious, and I can't recall laughing harder to a scene in a comedy in recent years. But what makes Chicolini's character avoid insufferable schtick is his ability to perform physical comedy. His facial expressions are simply entrancing and his antics on par with his explosive personality. He's almost like Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean, but more shameless and rowdy. Chicolini has an intense and infectious form of likability, and he never comes off as a nuisance. Duck Soup was released in 1933, and was met with less than stellar box office numbers, causing Paramount to drop The Marx Brothers, among other issues. The most likely reason it took in a low amount of revenue is because of the subject matter. The film is highly cynical, sarcastic, and unapologetically rude. America was hitting the time of The Great Depression, among the beginning stages of World War II. It goes to show that people weren't interested in seeing a cheeky, satirical portrayal of government and politics. Thankfully, the film has gotten its proper respect over the years, and is often hailed as The Marx Brothers' best film. I also wouldn't hesitate to bill this as one of the funniest and smartest comedy films ever made. At least on my personal list. The film tackles a number of subjects, from politics, imperialism, government, outlandish rules, and society itself, and satirizes them to the point of utter disbelief and hilarity. In no way is the film mean-spirited or deliberately crude. This was before that became the standard in comedy. It always keeps a sunny, cheery disposition, right down to the final frame. Its bravery is astonishing, even to this day. How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? This is comedic and satirical filmmaking at its absolute finest. The Marx Brothers are clearly a treasure, under-appreciated in this day and age, and painfully overlooked in a time where politics and social issues plague our nation. Duck Soup is slapstick done right, with a great band of character actors, one-liners galore, and a simple and effective premise that goes very far, surpassing anyone's expectations of "another stupid comedy from the year one." NOTE: It's also interesting to note that Groucho goes on record saying that him and his three brothers were just "Jews trying to get laughs." He denies that the film covered the topics of government and politics purposefully, and that he believes people read too much into it. I guess I'll reword my previous question like so; "How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? And they don't even try?" Starring: Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, Zeppo Marx, Margaret Dumont, Louis Calhern, Raquel Torres, and Edgar Kennedy. Directed by: Leo McCarey.

    The last 15 minutes of Duck Soup, inside Groucho's command headquarters during the war with Sylvania, are the funniest 15 minutes in film history. Non stop verbal, physical and visual gags, puns and insults, and almost all of them hit the mark , and play well 80 years later. Aide to Groucho, who is shooting out the window - " But sir, you are shooting your own men. Groucho hands the aide a bill - "here's five dollars , keep it under your hat." Grouch takes the five dollars back and says "better yet, I'll keep it under my hat." Duck Soup is the best Marx Brothers film because it is the most cynical and anarchic of them all. Some of the jokes are dated beyond help, and make cultural references that today's generation simply will not understand or appreciate, but those last 15 minutes are enough in itself to make this one of the all time great comedies.
