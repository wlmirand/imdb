    This movie was made at the same time as Terminal velocity" with Charlie Sheen. Some people are complaining that one movie is a rip-off the other. To be honest I don't know who is right. I don't really care. Both movies are on the same level. Both are decent popcorn movies to kill some time. Nothing to write home about. I have a soft spot for Gary Busey and I'm happy that he's the villain in "Drop zone" . Wesley Snipes as hero is nice , because he gives his rather generic hero some depth. You can obviously feel his pain. The movie has some quite attractive photography and interesting music. It also gives us some insight at the skydivers community. All in all it's not a bad way to spend a night. I give it 5/10.

    US marshal Pete Nissep and his brother Terry are escorting a prisoner on a plane when it is hijacked . Terry is killed in the shoot out and the gunmen escape the plane by parachute , a feat that leads the FBI to conclude that the hijackers must be dead . Refusing to believe the hijackers are dead and driven by his brother's death Pete enlists the help of Jessie Crossman to find the sky-jackers Wesley Snipes is one of those actors who rarely makes a great movie . The upside of this is that he rarely makes an absolutely dreadful one either and DROP ZONE is keeping with Snipes consistent form in film making if not tax accounting . It's not great , not dreadful but is never as good as it might have been One wonders if the producers were conscious of POINT BREAK from a couple of years previous to this film which also featured subsections of free fall parachuting alongside Gary Busey in a pivotal role . Here Busey plays the villain and the film goes out of its way to present the sky diving as being the major feature of the story , so much so that it overwhelms all the other aspects of the story such as characterisation and plotting . There's only so many times you can watch stunt doubles fly through the air at 120 mph without wishing for a little more substance

    sadly the director had no idea how to finish the climax because the whole story could have looked fantastic if the climax was superb. the cast was nice Wesley snipes & Yancy butler doing comedy & most action was done by Yancy butler specially the air action in which she skydives & grabs snipes.& later on the sea shore snipes punches her was hilarious. i loved Yancy in hard target & this is the second film of her i saw. now the story is about few convicts escaping from a plane & snipes as a cop goes after them with the help of Jessie a sky diving instructor. this was a good concept & i felt many things were missing the scenes were not filmed correctly.leaving holes in the plot such as Jessie wanted to shoot the guy in the plane but she did not,if Jessie would have shot him because she was alone going after the bad guys that would have been epic as this whole build up to the climax never make any sense its just a one time watch film don't expect anything from it.there are some nice stunts worth looking rest is boring. my rating is 5/10 .i can only give 5 points so far watch drop zone 1994 for Yancy butler she owned this film.

    The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy the skydiving sequences. Really bad cinematography including bad artificial lighting, bad set design. and, further, why would anybody want to watch a movie with Gary Busey. I thought he had ODd long ago. Although it was fun to watch the work of Mr. Snipes, I think you may want to skip this one in favor of just about anything else with him in it. I was glad to see Yancy Butler in the film and hope that she continues to get work in Hollywood. I was really hoping for a better film when I selected this title from my online service and will write a similar review for them as well.

    US Marshal Pete Nessip and his brother Terry, also a US Marshal are assigned to escort convicted computer hacker Earl Leedy to a top-security prison. But the commercial airliner Pete and Terry are on-board is hijacked by a group of terrorists led by renegade DEA agent Ty Moncrief who kidnaps Leedy and Terry is killed. Believing Leedy is dead, Pete is held responsible for the incident and is suspended. Pete sets out to track down the terrorists, and turns to help from professional skydiver Jesse Crossman (Whose ex-husband Jagger is one of the terrorists working with Ty), where Jesse and her team are taking part in a Independence Day skydiving show in Washington D.C, where airspace security is at minimum. Where Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer to expose the identities of undercover DEA agents to international drug rings. When Jagger is killed by Ty and Selkirk, one of Jesse's team members is injured, Pete and Jesse team up to stop Ty and his associates, and both Pete and Jesse can get their revenge.... There is a strange thing about Badham and his movies. They are strange average creatures that attract big stars, and for some reason, I cannot get enough of them. Here is a prime example of one. The action is limited to a few fights and some really bad blue screen diving (it really is the pits) but Snipes is at his swaggery best and really makes the film a little kookier. Released around the same time as Termianl Velocity, this is the more serious version, as Sheens monster really played it for laughs. Busey is out acted by his hair, and come the final scene, his hair has taken over his body, so his stunt double really has to wear the most awkward wig ever. Despite the bad effects and the average fight scenes, there is something about this movie that makes it watchable, when it shouldn't be...

    This might not be a great film but it is a lot of fun. Wesley Snipes plays US Marshall Pete Nessip, when he and his partner are ordered to transport a prisoner it seems like a routine job until their plane is hijacked. The hijackers take the prisoner and parachute out of the plane, unfortunately Pete's seniors don't believe this is possible and assume the hijackers and the prisoner died in the explosion caused when Pete's partner shot one of the hijackers. Pete is suspended but he won't drop the case; after asking around as to who might possibly be able to pull such as stunt he goes to the local sky diving school where he meets Jessie Crossman, an attractive female parachutist who isn't unknown to the law. It isn't long before he learns that the real bad guys are another group of parachutists led by Ty Moncrief, an ex-DEA agent who is selling the identities of undercover agents. In order to stop Ty, Pete must join Jessie's group and learn to sky dive himself. The lead actors; Wesley Snipes, Gary Busey and Yancy Butler all put in decent enough performances and the story moves along at a cracking pace with lots of impressive sky-diving action, some good fight scenes and an explosive shoot out at the end. The only real flaw in the action sequences were the close-ups during the parachuting scenes where it didn't look as though the actors were really parachuting. As is usually the case with action films there was a decent amount of humour thrown in; mostly involving Kyle Secor's character 'Swoop'.

    I know it's strange title but it's as strange as this movie !. We have here some nice elements to make one distinct Action : the unique atmosphere of skydiving, passenger 57 (Wesley Snipes) rides again, bad guys on the head of them Mr.(Gary Busey) himself !, and the capacities of (John Badham) the man who directed (Blue Thunder  1983), (Short Circuit  1986), (Stakeout  1987), and (Nick of Time  1995). And to tell you the truth the result was close to fair yet I found myself in the confusion zone ! Asking the same question : why this movie is so ridiculous ?!!. Is it the repetition of the plot ? Well, I saw that the details of the skydiving's world were quite catchy and dexterous but maybe too catchy and too dexterous ! As they were having bigger part than usual. So is the movie not hot enough ?! Well, I think that the events were hot but maybe too hot to a cold extent as I felt sometimes that I was watching a dull crazy cartoon with a lot of bloody violence in it, and the performance was too hot from everybody especially (Busey) who tried to be very evil to a level made him that evil indeed but for his role ! So instead of harming the other characters he harmed himself and us ! Hmm is it the drama ? Well, it happens to be that I'm a drama kind of person, and I didn't notice how at the end the hero got changed to a better man evidently among all of that annoying jam of too many BOOMS and BANGS !. Eventually I think it's that kind of matters when we have a lot of fast, empty and repeated everything. However that had been considered lately as fun, entertaining and brainlessly lovely. So by that measure it's not bad at allYet bear its effective sense of silliness !

    Gary Busey once again proves that nobody is as sneaky as Busey. We have ourselves another prime example of this in Drop Zone. Busey's character Ty Moncrief had it all. He was an evil genius, the greatest skydiver known to man, beautiful and of course, sneaky. Gary Busey is so sneaky that he is able to appear from thin air, grab Yancy Butler and growl in her face like a wild animal with nobody ever noticing him. To a man like you or I, this seems almost supernatural. To a cougar man, that's just everyday living. It is clear that Busey is well versed in hunting prey with his animal instincts. Another poster believes that Busey is half man half cougar. I've long thought this myself. Recently, however, I'm starting to believe that Busey is more cougar than man. How else to explain his mane? It's so unkempt and wild. No man, no matter how down and out or crazy has hair that wild. And Busey's grunts and growls are as fierce as any animal you would find in the wild. Certainly no man has ever growled quite like Busey. As time goes on it is becoming more and more clear that Gary Busey is a super species created by science, or from his determination and will power to become part cougar. The only thing that can stop him is if his thirst for the ultimate hunt takes over and the cougar dwelling inside him takes over the man inside him. If this were to happen, may god help us all. For, not only would we lose won of the greats of all time, he would probably eat all of our babies. Truly terrifying and impressive to think about. As for Snipes, he gives a nice performance of a man avenging Theo Huxtable. He goes undercover in the skydiving world to catch Busey. (I know, it's comical to think that somebody could hunt Busey. But movies are fantasy.) In a memorable montage scene Snipes learns all there is to know about skydiving in about five minutes. From there it's a fight between Snipes, with his intense training now the 2nd best skydiver, and Busey the world's greatest skydiver. Who will survive? How many people will Busey eat? How many pairs of drawstring pants will Snipes wear? How many crotches will Snipes punch? I won't give anymore away.

    I am impressed. We have an intricate plot. We have exciting characters. And we have Busey. Busey dominates the film. I am thoroughly pleased by his hair and his cougar-like movements. Every scene allows a unique perspective of Gary. I am astonished at how the director was able to capture the wild animal inside this man. Many films boast Busey and then fail to really let him out of his artistic cage. Drop Zone verifies my theory that Busey is a fearsome wild animal. It is phenomenal, but I have come to believe that Gary is actually half-man, half-cougar. And this is the film that convinced me. Sure, I had an inkling when I saw Hider in the House. And Plato's Run did more than drop a hint to me that something peculiar was going on with this actor's genetics. But Drop Zone stole my rational response to an unbelievable hypothesis. Snipes is satisfying. His wardrobe offers an intimate portrayal of character. The fashionable collarless tuxedo-style dress shirts reminded me of Monte Carlo or Naples maybe. Snipes seemed to say, "Hey show me a man that looks as good as me and I'll eat him." All in all: this film offers a chemistry between two men. Busey and Snipes embrace cinematic Parachuting almost as well as Reeves and Swayze embraced cinematic surfing. Remarkable.

Another poster believes that Busey is half man half cougar. I've long thought this myself. Recently, however, I'm starting to believe that Busey is more cougar than man. How else to explain his mane? It's so unkempt and wild. No man, no matter how down and out or crazy has hair that wild. And Busey's grunts and growls are as fierce as any animal you would find in the wild. Certainly no man has ever growled quite like Busey. As time goes on it is becoming more and more clear that Gary Busey is a super species created by science, or from his determination and will power to become part cougar. The only thing that can stop him is if his thirst for the ultimate hunt takes over and the cougar dwelling inside him takes over the man inside him. If this were to happen, may god help us all. For, not only would we lose won of the greats of all time, he would probably eat all of our babies. Truly terrifying and impressive to think about. As for Snipes, he gives a nice performance of a man avenging Theo Huxtable. He goes undercover in the skydiving world to catch Busey. (I know, it's comical to think that somebody could hunt Busey. But movies are fantasy.) In a memorable montage scene Snipes learns all there is to know about skydiving in about five minutes. From there it's a fight between Snipes, with his intense training now the 2nd best skydiver, and Busey the world's greatest skydiver. Who will survive? How many people will Busey eat? How many pairs of drawstring pants will Snipes wear? How many crotches will Snipes punch? I won't give anymore away.

    I am impressed. We have an intricate plot. We have exciting characters. And we have Busey. Busey dominates the film. I am thoroughly pleased by his hair and his cougar-like movements. Every scene allows a unique perspective of Gary. I am astonished at how the director was able to capture the wild animal inside this man. Many films boast Busey and then fail to really let him out of his artistic cage. Drop Zone verifies my theory that Busey is a fearsome wild animal. It is phenomenal, but I have come to believe that Gary is actually half-man, half-cougar. And this is the film that convinced me. Sure, I had an inkling when I saw Hider in the House. And Plato's Run did more than drop a hint to me that something peculiar was going on with this actor's genetics. But Drop Zone stole my rational response to an unbelievable hypothesis. Snipes is satisfying. His wardrobe offers an intimate portrayal of character. The fashionable collarless tuxedo-style dress shirts reminded me of Monte Carlo or Naples maybe. Snipes seemed to say, "Hey show me a man that looks as good as me and I'll eat him." All in all: this film offers a chemistry between two men. Busey and Snipes embrace cinematic Parachuting almost as well as Reeves and Swayze embraced cinematic surfing. Remarkable.

    This movie was made at the same time as Terminal velocity" with Charlie Sheen. Some people are complaining that one movie is a rip-off the other. To be honest I don't know who is right. I don't really care. Both movies are on the same level. Both are decent popcorn movies to kill some time. Nothing to write home about. I have a soft spot for Gary Busey and I'm happy that he's the villain in "Drop zone" . Wesley Snipes as hero is nice , because he gives his rather generic hero some depth. You can obviously feel his pain. The movie has some quite attractive photography and interesting music. It also gives us some insight at the skydivers community. All in all it's not a bad way to spend a night. I give it 5/10.

    US marshal Pete Nissep and his brother Terry are escorting a prisoner on a plane when it is hijacked . Terry is killed in the shoot out and the gunmen escape the plane by parachute , a feat that leads the FBI to conclude that the hijackers must be dead . Refusing to believe the hijackers are dead and driven by his brother's death Pete enlists the help of Jessie Crossman to find the sky-jackers Wesley Snipes is one of those actors who rarely makes a great movie . The upside of this is that he rarely makes an absolutely dreadful one either and DROP ZONE is keeping with Snipes consistent form in film making if not tax accounting . It's not great , not dreadful but is never as good as it might have been One wonders if the producers were conscious of POINT BREAK from a couple of years previous to this film which also featured subsections of free fall parachuting alongside Gary Busey in a pivotal role . Here Busey plays the villain and the film goes out of its way to present the sky diving as being the major feature of the story , so much so that it overwhelms all the other aspects of the story such as characterisation and plotting . There's only so many times you can watch stunt doubles fly through the air at 120 mph without wishing for a little more substance

    sadly the director had no idea how to finish the climax because the whole story could have looked fantastic if the climax was superb. the cast was nice Wesley snipes & Yancy butler doing comedy & most action was done by Yancy butler specially the air action in which she skydives & grabs snipes.& later on the sea shore snipes punches her was hilarious. i loved Yancy in hard target & this is the second film of her i saw. now the story is about few convicts escaping from a plane & snipes as a cop goes after them with the help of Jessie a sky diving instructor. this was a good concept & i felt many things were missing the scenes were not filmed correctly.leaving holes in the plot such as Jessie wanted to shoot the guy in the plane but she did not,if Jessie would have shot him because she was alone going after the bad guys that would have been epic as this whole build up to the climax never make any sense its just a one time watch film don't expect anything from it.there are some nice stunts worth looking rest is boring. my rating is 5/10 .i can only give 5 points so far watch drop zone 1994 for Yancy butler she owned this film.

    The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy the skydiving sequences. Really bad cinematography including bad artificial lighting, bad set design. and, further, why would anybody want to watch a movie with Gary Busey. I thought he had ODd long ago. Although it was fun to watch the work of Mr. Snipes, I think you may want to skip this one in favor of just about anything else with him in it. I was glad to see Yancy Butler in the film and hope that she continues to get work in Hollywood. I was really hoping for a better film when I selected this title from my online service and will write a similar review for them as well.

    US Marshal Pete Nessip and his brother Terry, also a US Marshal are assigned to escort convicted computer hacker Earl Leedy to a top-security prison. But the commercial airliner Pete and Terry are on-board is hijacked by a group of terrorists led by renegade DEA agent Ty Moncrief who kidnaps Leedy and Terry is killed. Believing Leedy is dead, Pete is held responsible for the incident and is suspended. Pete sets out to track down the terrorists, and turns to help from professional skydiver Jesse Crossman (Whose ex-husband Jagger is one of the terrorists working with Ty), where Jesse and her team are taking part in a Independence Day skydiving show in Washington D.C, where airspace security is at minimum. Where Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer to expose the identities of undercover DEA agents to international drug rings. When Jagger is killed by Ty and Selkirk, one of Jesse's team members is injured, Pete and Jesse team up to stop Ty and his associates, and both Pete and Jesse can get their revenge.... There is a strange thing about Badham and his movies. They are strange average creatures that attract big stars, and for some reason, I cannot get enough of them. Here is a prime example of one. The action is limited to a few fights and some really bad blue screen diving (it really is the pits) but Snipes is at his swaggery best and really makes the film a little kookier. Released around the same time as Termianl Velocity, this is the more serious version, as Sheens monster really played it for laughs. Busey is out acted by his hair, and come the final scene, his hair has taken over his body, so his stunt double really has to wear the most awkward wig ever. Despite the bad effects and the average fight scenes, there is something about this movie that makes it watchable, when it shouldn't be...

    This might not be a great film but it is a lot of fun. Wesley Snipes plays US Marshall Pete Nessip, when he and his partner are ordered to transport a prisoner it seems like a routine job until their plane is hijacked. The hijackers take the prisoner and parachute out of the plane, unfortunately Pete's seniors don't believe this is possible and assume the hijackers and the prisoner died in the explosion caused when Pete's partner shot one of the hijackers. Pete is suspended but he won't drop the case; after asking around as to who might possibly be able to pull such as stunt he goes to the local sky diving school where he meets Jessie Crossman, an attractive female parachutist who isn't unknown to the law. It isn't long before he learns that the real bad guys are another group of parachutists led by Ty Moncrief, an ex-DEA agent who is selling the identities of undercover agents. In order to stop Ty, Pete must join Jessie's group and learn to sky dive himself. The lead actors; Wesley Snipes, Gary Busey and Yancy Butler all put in decent enough performances and the story moves along at a cracking pace with lots of impressive sky-diving action, some good fight scenes and an explosive shoot out at the end. The only real flaw in the action sequences were the close-ups during the parachuting scenes where it didn't look as though the actors were really parachuting. As is usually the case with action films there was a decent amount of humour thrown in; mostly involving Kyle Secor's character 'Swoop'.

    I know it's strange title but it's as strange as this movie !. We have here some nice elements to make one distinct Action : the unique atmosphere of skydiving, passenger 57 (Wesley Snipes) rides again, bad guys on the head of them Mr.(Gary Busey) himself !, and the capacities of (John Badham) the man who directed (Blue Thunder  1983), (Short Circuit  1986), (Stakeout  1987), and (Nick of Time  1995). And to tell you the truth the result was close to fair yet I found myself in the confusion zone ! Asking the same question : why this movie is so ridiculous ?!!. Is it the repetition of the plot ? Well, I saw that the details of the skydiving's world were quite catchy and dexterous but maybe too catchy and too dexterous ! As they were having bigger part than usual. So is the movie not hot enough ?! Well, I think that the events were hot but maybe too hot to a cold extent as I felt sometimes that I was watching a dull crazy cartoon with a lot of bloody violence in it, and the performance was too hot from everybody especially (Busey) who tried to be very evil to a level made him that evil indeed but for his role ! So instead of harming the other characters he harmed himself and us ! Hmm is it the drama ? Well, it happens to be that I'm a drama kind of person, and I didn't notice how at the end the hero got changed to a better man evidently among all of that annoying jam of too many BOOMS and BANGS !. Eventually I think it's that kind of matters when we have a lot of fast, empty and repeated everything. However that had been considered lately as fun, entertaining and brainlessly lovely. So by that measure it's not bad at allYet bear its effective sense of silliness !

    Gary Busey once again proves that nobody is as sneaky as Busey. We have ourselves another prime example of this in Drop Zone. Busey's character Ty Moncrief had it all. He was an evil genius, the greatest skydiver known to man, beautiful and of course, sneaky. Gary Busey is so sneaky that he is able to appear from thin air, grab Yancy Butler and growl in her face like a wild animal with nobody ever noticing him. To a man like you or I, this seems almost supernatural. To a cougar man, that's just everyday living. It is clear that Busey is well versed in hunting prey with his animal instincts. Another poster believes that Busey is half man half cougar. I've long thought this myself. Recently, however, I'm starting to believe that Busey is more cougar than man. How else to explain his mane? It's so unkempt and wild. No man, no matter how down and out or crazy has hair that wild. And Busey's grunts and growls are as fierce as any animal you would find in the wild. Certainly no man has ever growled quite like Busey. As time goes on it is becoming more and more clear that Gary Busey is a super species created by science, or from his determination and will power to become part cougar. The only thing that can stop him is if his thirst for the ultimate hunt takes over and the cougar dwelling inside him takes over the man inside him. If this were to happen, may god help us all. For, not only would we lose won of the greats of all time, he would probably eat all of our babies. Truly terrifying and impressive to think about.

From there it's a fight between Snipes, with his intense training now the 2nd best skydiver, and Busey the world's greatest skydiver. Who will survive? How many people will Busey eat? How many pairs of drawstring pants will Snipes wear? How many crotches will Snipes punch? I won't give anymore away.

Eventually I think it's that kind of matters when we have a lot of fast, empty and repeated everything. However that had been considered lately as fun, entertaining and brainlessly lovely. So by that measure it's not bad at allYet bear its effective sense of silliness !

    Gary Busey once again proves that nobody is as sneaky as Busey. We have ourselves another prime example of this in Drop Zone. Busey's character Ty Moncrief had it all. He was an evil genius, the greatest skydiver known to man, beautiful and of course, sneaky. Gary Busey is so sneaky that he is able to appear from thin air, grab Yancy Butler and growl in her face like a wild animal with nobody ever noticing him. To a man like you or I, this seems almost supernatural. To a cougar man, that's just everyday living. It is clear that Busey is well versed in hunting prey with his animal instincts. Another poster believes that Busey is half man half cougar. I've long thought this myself. Recently, however, I'm starting to believe that Busey is more cougar than man. How else to explain his mane? It's so unkempt and wild. No man, no matter how down and out or crazy has hair that wild. And Busey's grunts and growls are as fierce as any animal you would find in the wild. Certainly no man has ever growled quite like Busey. As time goes on it is becoming more and more clear that Gary Busey is a super species created by science, or from his determination and will power to become part cougar. The only thing that can stop him is if his thirst for the ultimate hunt takes over and the cougar dwelling inside him takes over the man inside him. If this were to happen, may god help us all. For, not only would we lose won of the greats of all time, he would probably eat all of our babies. Truly terrifying and impressive to think about. As for Snipes, he gives a nice performance of a man avenging Theo Huxtable. He goes undercover in the skydiving world to catch Busey. (I know, it's comical to think that somebody could hunt Busey. But movies are fantasy.) In a memorable montage scene Snipes learns all there is to know about skydiving in about five minutes. From there it's a fight between Snipes, with his intense training now the 2nd best skydiver, and Busey the world's greatest skydiver. Who will survive? How many people will Busey eat? How many pairs of drawstring pants will Snipes wear? How many crotches will Snipes punch? I won't give anymore away.

    I am impressed. We have an intricate plot. We have exciting characters. And we have Busey. Busey dominates the film. I am thoroughly pleased by his hair and his cougar-like movements. Every scene allows a unique perspective of Gary. I am astonished at how the director was able to capture the wild animal inside this man. Many films boast Busey and then fail to really let him out of his artistic cage. Drop Zone verifies my theory that Busey is a fearsome wild animal. It is phenomenal, but I have come to believe that Gary is actually half-man, half-cougar. And this is the film that convinced me. Sure, I had an inkling when I saw Hider in the House. And Plato's Run did more than drop a hint to me that something peculiar was going on with this actor's genetics. But Drop Zone stole my rational response to an unbelievable hypothesis. Snipes is satisfying. His wardrobe offers an intimate portrayal of character. The fashionable collarless tuxedo-style dress shirts reminded me of Monte Carlo or Naples maybe. Snipes seemed to say, "Hey show me a man that looks as good as me and I'll eat him." All in all: this film offers a chemistry between two men. Busey and Snipes embrace cinematic Parachuting almost as well as Reeves and Swayze embraced cinematic surfing. Remarkable.
