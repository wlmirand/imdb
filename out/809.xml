    I basically watched this movie due to the fact that Toru Takemitsu for some reason got sucked into doing this ignorant film. If you have seen any of his work on Hiroshi Teshigahara's, Masaki Kobayashi's or Akira Kurosawa's films you know why I would be interested. From the opening credits I new this was going to be a train wreck when they decided to add Chinese gongs over Takemitsu's otherwise realistic Japanese style score, thus beginning the baffling ignorant betrayal of these Japanese people as sex crazed, backwards criminals whom only a westerner, well studied in Japanese culture can communicate with, as well as manipulate them like they were simpletons or something. I gather they even twisted Takemitsu's arm (who usually had a very minimalistic approach to scoring at key moments) into doing a continual Japanese score to remind us constantly that we are dealing with a mysterious and sinister culture here. Beyond this the acting is like what you would find in a a Jim Jarmusch film (ie: bad), and you can't help but feel sorry for Harvey Keitel who wouldn't be able to act badly if he tried, and Sean Connery and, well, the whole cast when you think about it, who are stuck with this director and script, both of which were not up to par with the ambition they were aiming for (I'm guessing intellectual thriller). Also, is it so hard to fly over some Japanese actors or find Japanese Americans for the parts instead of getting just any Asian? Bad accents galore! I must admit, I only watched about half an hour of it, but I can guess that it doesn't get any better later. Hell, I didn't really even care about the woman who was killed anyway.

    I watch this kind of movie for fun and suspend my disbelief. Rising Sun is not bad at all. It could have been much worse without Connery. I am not a big fan of oriental "wisdom" sound bites e.g. "Leave the cage door open the bird may return". Spoken by an unintelligent actor you don't like they become a lightening rod for all your ire. Fortunately Connery is not such an actor. The senior Japanese executives look like they have irritable bowel syndrome if they smiled their faces would crack. It is exaggerated and silly but for the most part the action keeps your interest. Although, at the end I got confused as to who killed the girl. I am still not sure. It is worth renting to pass a couple hours.

    It's obviously big-budget and well constructed, but the convoluted plot and epic two-hour duration cruel this Japanese-flavoured thriller that stars Sean Connery as an emeritus captain and specialist in Oriental custom, called in to assist the investigation of a murder in a foreign-owned corporation that is apparently concealing information to contain the scandal. Wesley Snipes is the younger brash detective who learns from Connery that there's more than one way to skin a cat when the cat isn't being co-operative. Tia Carrera co-stars in a fringe role as a visual editing specialist, brought into the investigation when it becomes apparent that CCTV footage of the incident has been doctored. Ray Wise ("Twin Peaks") plays a corrupt political candidate caught up in the affair, and Harvey Keitel, Stan Shaw and Mako all have significant supporting roles. Some lighthearted moments (Connery dispatches a couple of minders after he's manhandled and there's a running joke about Snipes' nickname of 'Cohai' akin to a trainee) punctuate what at times becomes little more than a forensic investigation of the CCTV DVD, such is the time dedicated to analysing its contents (and apparent omissions). Not only does the sun rise, but it will also set before you've finished watching this epic, though it offers an interesting cultural slant, can't justify the mammoth run-time.

    From director Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Right Stuff, Quills), I had probably heard of this or seen a poster, and it was interesting to hear the two stars in a film together, I was up for seeing what it was like. Basically during a party in a Japanese corporation at the office, a woman who obviously a professional escort is found dead, this is supposedly due to rough sex. Called in to investigate the death is police detective Lt. Webster Smith (Wesley Snipes), but he is called by someone who tells him that should pick up former police Captain and an expert on Japanese affairs, John Connor (Sir Sean Connery) (not to be confused with the saviour of mankind in the Terminator films, LOL). It looks like your average nothing out of the ordinary death, Smith is sure of this, but Connor is suspicious there may have been foul play, and there is evidence to suggest murder. Using sophisticated video technology the two detective looks back at the footage captured on CCTV, from inside and out of the party. They certainly prove that Eddie Sakamura (Licence to Kill's Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) had something to do with what happened to the hooker, he is the son of a wealthy Japanese businessman. By the end the conclusion is that she was indeed murdered by strangulation, but it is not the police who catch the criminal, it is Sakamura's friends who get him by burying him alive in wet cement, and all Connor and Smith can do is go there separate ways. Also starring Harvey Keitel as Lt. Tom Graham, True Lies' Tia Carrere as Jingo Asakuma, Tatjana Patitz as Cheryl Lynn Austin, Kevin Anderson as Bob Richmond, Mako as Yoshida-San, Ray Wise as Senator John Morton, Stan Egi as Ishihara and Steve Buscemi as Willy 'the Weasel' Wilhelm. Connery as usual gives a determined performance as the man who knows a lot about what is going on, and Snipes is alright as his partner getting his own ideas along the way, I will confess that I did not pay the fullest attention to what was going on, but it didn't really get what I watched anyway, it could have been a bit simpler, but it wasn't a bad thriller. Okay!

    Based on Crichton's novel of the same name, 'Rising Sun' is a Time-Pass fare, the doesn't falter as far as quick entertainment is concerned. The Fast-Pacing is spot-on & The Performances work! 'Rising Sun' Synopsis: When a professional escort is found dead, apparently after a violent sexual encounter, Police Detective Web Smith & John Connor, a former police Captain and expert on Japanese affairs, are sent to investigate. 'Rising Sun' is good stuff. It's Entertaining, Progressive & Fast-Paced. The Screenplay by Crichton & Michael Backes, is truly engaging & well-written. Philip Kaufman has Directed the film well. Cinematography is eye-filling. Editing is crisp. Art Design is fair. Performance-Wise: Sir Sean Connery & Wesley Snipes make superb screen-heroes & share an infectious chemistry throughout. Harvey Keitel is in excellent form. Tia Carrere does her bit well. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is effective. Ray Wise is decent. Steve Buscemi is as usual. On the whole, 'Rising Sun' is Entertaining.

    Very nice murder thriller, and arguably one of Wesley Snipes' best roles in his career. And of course, he didn't want to miss being paired with the man himself, Sean Connery! Tight direction, entertaining dialogues(especially Connery's yap on Japanese traditions are hilarious), the suspense and also intense performances from Connery & Snipes make this movie a winner. I wouldn't really regard Rising Sun as an action thriller because the action factor is low. But the movie amply compensates with tense moments. The only places where I feel our attention span drops are those kinda tediously long camera footages shown of the murder and all that explanation by the hot Tia Carrere on how the video was edited blah, blah! Verdict: Still, a highly engaging thriller. Racy & entertaining!

    Rising Sun is directed by Philip Kaufman who also co-writes with Michael Crichton and Michael Backes, with the adaptation coming form Crichton's own novel of the same name. It stars Sean Connery, Wesley Snipes, Harvey Keitel, Ray Wise and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. Music is by Tōru Takemitsu and cinematography by Michael Chapman. Story sees Capt. John Connor (Connery) and Lt. Webster "Web" Smith (Snipes) paired together to try and solve the mystery of a woman murdered at a Japanese high corporation party. With powerful people possibly involved and relations between the American and Japanese people starting to strain, Connor and Smith must crack the case sooner rather than later. A tough ask because there's the distinct whiff of a cover up in the air and only a grainy CCTV video as evidence to go on. It was a controversial novel, a best seller for sure, but Michael Crichton was accused of crafting an anti-Japanese diatribe, though in some quarters it was heralded as a wake up call that America was losing the business war to Japan. Even though Crichton was brought in to adapt the screenplay, it ultimately stands as Kaufman's work because alterations have been made to Crichton's text to balance out, as it were, the villainy/corruption quota between the two opposing cultures. The end result is a film that has no real urgency, excitement, tension or boldness; unless the sexual deviant behaviour of the poor lady murdered counts for the latter that is? Clearly Kaufman and Crichton are not meant to be, the former's stylish leanings can't harness the intricate paranoia from Crichton's page, which ultimately leaves us with a rather routine murder mystery. Shame, because the thirst third is pretty great stuff, visually arresting and with characters formed, story simmers nicely like it's going to boil over into murky intrigue and cross cultural bitterness. Sadly it doesn't. The director tries to beef things up with some nudity, confrontations and a number of shifty characters on the edges of the frame, but these only still further bring home just how ponderous the story actually is. There's no raising the pulse for the finale either, it may try and come off as an ambiguous tester, but ultimately it's lightweight and wasn't worth the wait. Cast wise Connery and Snipes work well together in that father figure/student way (or sempai/kohai to be exactly on plotting), but the former's gruff beefy charm is diluted and Snipes is given very little to do. Keitel turns in an interesting one, as does Ray Wise, but even these portrayals tend to shine only because what's around them is borderline dull. It does look nice though, where a very modernist sheen plays host to some shifty shenanigans. Perhaps it really is a simple case of too much compromise going on in here? Hell, Kaufman even changed the killer from that of the one in the novel. But considering the talent involved in the production and a fire-cracker source to work from, this really should have been much better. A wasted chance it remains. 4/10

    Around the period when Michael Crichton adaptations seemed to be the "it" thing (after the success of "Jurassic Park"), Crichton's "Rising Sun" would be the next one off the ranks this time by film-maker Philip Kaufman. Two cops, one an expert in the Japanese culture are put on the case of a dead woman found in a boardroom of a Japanese Los Angeles corporation building. It was quite a modest, if thinly plotted mystery thriller with an exceptional performance by Sean Connery. While the paranoid story was a manipulative puzzle with cultural, corporation and political subtexts, things just seem to happen with little depth to why and when answered it came off too easy. Sure it could be suspenseful, but the lead characters (Snipes and Connery) never felt like they were in any real sort of threat, because they knew what was coming (well more so Connery's character). Rarely does it create a false state of mind. Kaufman's slick direction of this highly produced production is economical, but his on cruise control directing from the stuffy script. Too bad because it's a fascinating set-up, but the execution for most part is thematically lukewarm. Wesley Snipes is workable across from Connery, forming a decent chemistry. Harvey Keitel provides some bite and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa the flair. Also the cast features Tia Carrere, Ray Wise and Mako. A diverting, but less than creative exercise.

    What could have been a tired entry in the buddy-buddy cop thriller genre turns into something else at the hands of expert director and craftsman Philip Kaufman (INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS). Sure, it's no masterpiece, but this adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel makes for compelling viewing, a fun entry in the East-meets-West sub-genre of the films detailing the conflict that arises when two different cultures are forced to come together. The plot is essentially that of a murder mystery, but with Crichton as source material there's the expected preoccupation with technology (a piece of CCTV footage plays a pivotal role here, throwing up questions as to privacy and manipulation, with the film feeling way ahead of its time some twenty years later). The presence of Wesley Snipes as the lead begs the question "miscasting?" but I found him on top form here and a damn sight better than he was in the same year's DEMOLITION MAN. Connery bags the best role and steals all of his scenes, while Harvey Keitel gives a volatile performance and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is a pleasure when he's given the chance to act (and not typecast as the villain, either). Altogether the culture clash plot kept me watching to the end and I wasn't disappointed.

    Rising Sun falls somewhere between buddy cop film and Neo-Noir murder mystery, and it doesn't work very well as either. The whole thing feels messy and and makes no sense. This movie demands more from the audience than it gives them. It's not an unwatchable movie, but it's never that interesting, or involving. Sean Connery and Westley Snipes are indeed a mix match, but they are so in the wrong way. Snipes goes through must of the picture being patronized by Connery's Zen Zinger persona. After a while the dynamic starts to become something like a father and child. Connery gets all the good lines, but he goes through the movie never having a moments concern or a sense of jeopardy. that and the Japanese experience of his Character lead me to believe that Steven Seagal may have been more at home in the role (which doesn't demand much). Come to think of it, nobody in the cast is especially that memorable. The pay off for the whole thing is kind of disappointing, partially because nothing really gets explained. when it's all over Rising Sun ends up being a rather bland over long endurance test.

    I basically watched this movie due to the fact that Toru Takemitsu for some reason got sucked into doing this ignorant film. If you have seen any of his work on Hiroshi Teshigahara's, Masaki Kobayashi's or Akira Kurosawa's films you know why I would be interested. From the opening credits I new this was going to be a train wreck when they decided to add Chinese gongs over Takemitsu's otherwise realistic Japanese style score, thus beginning the baffling ignorant betrayal of these Japanese people as sex crazed, backwards criminals whom only a westerner, well studied in Japanese culture can communicate with, as well as manipulate them like they were simpletons or something. I gather they even twisted Takemitsu's arm (who usually had a very minimalistic approach to scoring at key moments) into doing a continual Japanese score to remind us constantly that we are dealing with a mysterious and sinister culture here. Beyond this the acting is like what you would find in a a Jim Jarmusch film (ie: bad), and you can't help but feel sorry for Harvey Keitel who wouldn't be able to act badly if he tried, and Sean Connery and, well, the whole cast when you think about it, who are stuck with this director and script, both of which were not up to par with the ambition they were aiming for (I'm guessing intellectual thriller).

    Around the period when Michael Crichton adaptations seemed to be the "it" thing (after the success of "Jurassic Park"), Crichton's "Rising Sun" would be the next one off the ranks this time by film-maker Philip Kaufman. Two cops, one an expert in the Japanese culture are put on the case of a dead woman found in a boardroom of a Japanese Los Angeles corporation building. It was quite a modest, if thinly plotted mystery thriller with an exceptional performance by Sean Connery. While the paranoid story was a manipulative puzzle with cultural, corporation and political subtexts, things just seem to happen with little depth to why and when answered it came off too easy. Sure it could be suspenseful, but the lead characters (Snipes and Connery) never felt like they were in any real sort of threat, because they knew what was coming (well more so Connery's character). Rarely does it create a false state of mind. Kaufman's slick direction of this highly produced production is economical, but his on cruise control directing from the stuffy script. Too bad because it's a fascinating set-up, but the execution for most part is thematically lukewarm. Wesley Snipes is workable across from Connery, forming a decent chemistry. Harvey Keitel provides some bite and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa the flair. Also the cast features Tia Carrere, Ray Wise and Mako. A diverting, but less than creative exercise.

    What could have been a tired entry in the buddy-buddy cop thriller genre turns into something else at the hands of expert director and craftsman Philip Kaufman (INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS). Sure, it's no masterpiece, but this adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel makes for compelling viewing, a fun entry in the East-meets-West sub-genre of the films detailing the conflict that arises when two different cultures are forced to come together. The plot is essentially that of a murder mystery, but with Crichton as source material there's the expected preoccupation with technology (a piece of CCTV footage plays a pivotal role here, throwing up questions as to privacy and manipulation, with the film feeling way ahead of its time some twenty years later). The presence of Wesley Snipes as the lead begs the question "miscasting?" but I found him on top form here and a damn sight better than he was in the same year's DEMOLITION MAN. Connery bags the best role and steals all of his scenes, while Harvey Keitel gives a volatile performance and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is a pleasure when he's given the chance to act (and not typecast as the villain, either). Altogether the culture clash plot kept me watching to the end and I wasn't disappointed.

    Rising Sun falls somewhere between buddy cop film and Neo-Noir murder mystery, and it doesn't work very well as either. The whole thing feels messy and and makes no sense. This movie demands more from the audience than it gives them. It's not an unwatchable movie, but it's never that interesting, or involving. Sean Connery and Westley Snipes are indeed a mix match, but they are so in the wrong way. Snipes goes through must of the picture being patronized by Connery's Zen Zinger persona. After a while the dynamic starts to become something like a father and child. Connery gets all the good lines, but he goes through the movie never having a moments concern or a sense of jeopardy. that and the Japanese experience of his Character lead me to believe that Steven Seagal may have been more at home in the role (which doesn't demand much). Come to think of it, nobody in the cast is especially that memorable. The pay off for the whole thing is kind of disappointing, partially because nothing really gets explained. when it's all over Rising Sun ends up being a rather bland over long endurance test.

    I basically watched this movie due to the fact that Toru Takemitsu for some reason got sucked into doing this ignorant film. If you have seen any of his work on Hiroshi Teshigahara's, Masaki Kobayashi's or Akira Kurosawa's films you know why I would be interested. From the opening credits I new this was going to be a train wreck when they decided to add Chinese gongs over Takemitsu's otherwise realistic Japanese style score, thus beginning the baffling ignorant betrayal of these Japanese people as sex crazed, backwards criminals whom only a westerner, well studied in Japanese culture can communicate with, as well as manipulate them like they were simpletons or something. I gather they even twisted Takemitsu's arm (who usually had a very minimalistic approach to scoring at key moments) into doing a continual Japanese score to remind us constantly that we are dealing with a mysterious and sinister culture here. Beyond this the acting is like what you would find in a a Jim Jarmusch film (ie: bad), and you can't help but feel sorry for Harvey Keitel who wouldn't be able to act badly if he tried, and Sean Connery and, well, the whole cast when you think about it, who are stuck with this director and script, both of which were not up to par with the ambition they were aiming for (I'm guessing intellectual thriller). Also, is it so hard to fly over some Japanese actors or find Japanese Americans for the parts instead of getting just any Asian? Bad accents galore! I must admit, I only watched about half an hour of it, but I can guess that it doesn't get any better later. Hell, I didn't really even care about the woman who was killed anyway.

    I watch this kind of movie for fun and suspend my disbelief. Rising Sun is not bad at all. It could have been much worse without Connery. I am not a big fan of oriental "wisdom" sound bites e.g. "Leave the cage door open the bird may return". Spoken by an unintelligent actor you don't like they become a lightening rod for all your ire. Fortunately Connery is not such an actor. The senior Japanese executives look like they have irritable bowel syndrome if they smiled their faces would crack. It is exaggerated and silly but for the most part the action keeps your interest. Although, at the end I got confused as to who killed the girl. I am still not sure. It is worth renting to pass a couple hours.

    It's obviously big-budget and well constructed, but the convoluted plot and epic two-hour duration cruel this Japanese-flavoured thriller that stars Sean Connery as an emeritus captain and specialist in Oriental custom, called in to assist the investigation of a murder in a foreign-owned corporation that is apparently concealing information to contain the scandal. Wesley Snipes is the younger brash detective who learns from Connery that there's more than one way to skin a cat when the cat isn't being co-operative. Tia Carrera co-stars in a fringe role as a visual editing specialist, brought into the investigation when it becomes apparent that CCTV footage of the incident has been doctored. Ray Wise ("Twin Peaks") plays a corrupt political candidate caught up in the affair, and Harvey Keitel, Stan Shaw and Mako all have significant supporting roles. Some lighthearted moments (Connery dispatches a couple of minders after he's manhandled and there's a running joke about Snipes' nickname of 'Cohai' akin to a trainee) punctuate what at times becomes little more than a forensic investigation of the CCTV DVD, such is the time dedicated to analysing its contents (and apparent omissions). Not only does the sun rise, but it will also set before you've finished watching this epic, though it offers an interesting cultural slant, can't justify the mammoth run-time.

    From director Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Right Stuff, Quills), I had probably heard of this or seen a poster, and it was interesting to hear the two stars in a film together, I was up for seeing what it was like. Basically during a party in a Japanese corporation at the office, a woman who obviously a professional escort is found dead, this is supposedly due to rough sex. Called in to investigate the death is police detective Lt. Webster Smith (Wesley Snipes), but he is called by someone who tells him that should pick up former police Captain and an expert on Japanese affairs, John Connor (Sir Sean Connery) (not to be confused with the saviour of mankind in the Terminator films, LOL). It looks like your average nothing out of the ordinary death, Smith is sure of this, but Connor is suspicious there may have been foul play, and there is evidence to suggest murder. Using sophisticated video technology the two detective looks back at the footage captured on CCTV, from inside and out of the party. They certainly prove that Eddie Sakamura (Licence to Kill's Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) had something to do with what happened to the hooker, he is the son of a wealthy Japanese businessman. By the end the conclusion is that she was indeed murdered by strangulation, but it is not the police who catch the criminal, it is Sakamura's friends who get him by burying him alive in wet cement, and all Connor and Smith can do is go there separate ways. Also starring Harvey Keitel as Lt. Tom Graham, True Lies' Tia Carrere as Jingo Asakuma, Tatjana Patitz as Cheryl Lynn Austin, Kevin Anderson as Bob Richmond, Mako as Yoshida-San, Ray Wise as Senator John Morton, Stan Egi as Ishihara and Steve Buscemi as Willy 'the Weasel' Wilhelm. Connery as usual gives a determined performance as the man who knows a lot about what is going on, and Snipes is alright as his partner getting his own ideas along the way, I will confess that I did not pay the fullest attention to what was going on, but it didn't really get what I watched anyway, it could have been a bit simpler, but it wasn't a bad thriller. Okay!

    Based on Crichton's novel of the same name, 'Rising Sun' is a Time-Pass fare, the doesn't falter as far as quick entertainment is concerned. The Fast-Pacing is spot-on & The Performances work! 'Rising Sun' Synopsis: When a professional escort is found dead, apparently after a violent sexual encounter, Police Detective Web Smith & John Connor, a former police Captain and expert on Japanese affairs, are sent to investigate. 'Rising Sun' is good stuff. It's Entertaining, Progressive & Fast-Paced. The Screenplay by Crichton & Michael Backes, is truly engaging & well-written. Philip Kaufman has Directed the film well. Cinematography is eye-filling. Editing is crisp. Art Design is fair. Performance-Wise: Sir Sean Connery & Wesley Snipes make superb screen-heroes & share an infectious chemistry throughout. Harvey Keitel is in excellent form. Tia Carrere does her bit well. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is effective. Ray Wise is decent. Steve Buscemi is as usual. On the whole, 'Rising Sun' is Entertaining.

    Very nice murder thriller, and arguably one of Wesley Snipes' best roles in his career. And of course, he didn't want to miss being paired with the man himself, Sean Connery! Tight direction, entertaining dialogues(especially Connery's yap on Japanese traditions are hilarious), the suspense and also intense performances from Connery & Snipes make this movie a winner. I wouldn't really regard Rising Sun as an action thriller because the action factor is low. But the movie amply compensates with tense moments. The only places where I feel our attention span drops are those kinda tediously long camera footages shown of the murder and all that explanation by the hot Tia Carrere on how the video was edited blah, blah! Verdict: Still, a highly engaging thriller. Racy & entertaining!

    Rising Sun is directed by Philip Kaufman who also co-writes with Michael Crichton and Michael Backes, with the adaptation coming form Crichton's own novel of the same name. It stars Sean Connery, Wesley Snipes, Harvey Keitel, Ray Wise and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. Music is by Tōru Takemitsu and cinematography by Michael Chapman. Story sees Capt. John Connor (Connery) and Lt. Webster "Web" Smith (Snipes) paired together to try and solve the mystery of a woman murdered at a Japanese high corporation party. With powerful people possibly involved and relations between the American and Japanese people starting to strain, Connor and Smith must crack the case sooner rather than later. A tough ask because there's the distinct whiff of a cover up in the air and only a grainy CCTV video as evidence to go on. It was a controversial novel, a best seller for sure, but Michael Crichton was accused of crafting an anti-Japanese diatribe, though in some quarters it was heralded as a wake up call that America was losing the business war to Japan. Even though Crichton was brought in to adapt the screenplay, it ultimately stands as Kaufman's work because alterations have been made to Crichton's text to balance out, as it were, the villainy/corruption quota between the two opposing cultures. The end result is a film that has no real urgency, excitement, tension or boldness; unless the sexual deviant behaviour of the poor lady murdered counts for the latter that is? Clearly Kaufman and Crichton are not meant to be, the former's stylish leanings can't harness the intricate paranoia from Crichton's page, which ultimately leaves us with a rather routine murder mystery. Shame, because the thirst third is pretty great stuff, visually arresting and with characters formed, story simmers nicely like it's going to boil over into murky intrigue and cross cultural bitterness. Sadly it doesn't. The director tries to beef things up with some nudity, confrontations and a number of shifty characters on the edges of the frame, but these only still further bring home just how ponderous the story actually is. There's no raising the pulse for the finale either, it may try and come off as an ambiguous tester, but ultimately it's lightweight and wasn't worth the wait. Cast wise Connery and Snipes work well together in that father figure/student way (or sempai/kohai to be exactly on plotting), but the former's gruff beefy charm is diluted and Snipes is given very little to do. Keitel turns in an interesting one, as does Ray Wise, but even these portrayals tend to shine only because what's around them is borderline dull. It does look nice though, where a very modernist sheen plays host to some shifty shenanigans. Perhaps it really is a simple case of too much compromise going on in here? Hell, Kaufman even changed the killer from that of the one in the novel. But considering the talent involved in the production and a fire-cracker source to work from, this really should have been much better. A wasted chance it remains. 4/10

It was quite a modest, if thinly plotted mystery thriller with an exceptional performance by Sean Connery.

Sure, it's no masterpiece, but this adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel makes for compelling viewing, a fun entry in the East-meets-West sub-genre of the films detailing the conflict that arises when two different cultures are forced to come together. The plot is essentially that of a murder mystery, but with Crichton as source material there's the expected preoccupation with technology (a piece of CCTV footage plays a pivotal role here, throwing up questions as to privacy and manipulation, with the film feeling way ahead of its time some twenty years later). The presence of Wesley Snipes as the lead begs the question "miscasting?" but I found him on top form here and a damn sight better than he was in the same year's DEMOLITION MAN. Connery bags the best role and steals all of his scenes, while Harvey Keitel gives a volatile performance and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is a pleasure when he's given the chance to act (and not typecast as the villain, either). Altogether the culture clash plot kept me watching to the end and I wasn't disappointed.

    I basically watched this movie due to the fact that Toru Takemitsu for some reason got sucked into doing this ignorant film. If you have seen any of his work on Hiroshi Teshigahara's, Masaki Kobayashi's or Akira Kurosawa's films you know why I would be interested. From the opening credits I new this was going to be a train wreck when they decided to add Chinese gongs over Takemitsu's otherwise realistic Japanese style score, thus beginning the baffling ignorant betrayal of these Japanese people as sex crazed, backwards criminals whom only a westerner, well studied in Japanese culture can communicate with, as well as manipulate them like they were simpletons or something.

A tough ask because there's the distinct whiff of a cover up in the air and only a grainy CCTV video as evidence to go on. It was a controversial novel, a best seller for sure, but Michael Crichton was accused of crafting an anti-Japanese diatribe, though in some quarters it was heralded as a wake up call that America was losing the business war to Japan. Even though Crichton was brought in to adapt the screenplay, it ultimately stands as Kaufman's work because alterations have been made to Crichton's text to balance out, as it were, the villainy/corruption quota between the two opposing cultures. The end result is a film that has no real urgency, excitement, tension or boldness; unless the sexual deviant behaviour of the poor lady murdered counts for the latter that is? Clearly Kaufman and Crichton are not meant to be, the former's stylish leanings can't harness the intricate paranoia from Crichton's page, which ultimately leaves us with a rather routine murder mystery. Shame, because the thirst third is pretty great stuff, visually arresting and with characters formed, story simmers nicely like it's going to boil over into murky intrigue and cross cultural bitterness. Sadly it doesn't. The director tries to beef things up with some nudity, confrontations and a number of shifty characters on the edges of the frame, but these only still further bring home just how ponderous the story actually is. There's no raising the pulse for the finale either, it may try and come off as an ambiguous tester, but ultimately it's lightweight and wasn't worth the wait. Cast wise Connery and Snipes work well together in that father figure/student way (or sempai/kohai to be exactly on plotting), but the former's gruff beefy charm is diluted and Snipes is given very little to do. Keitel turns in an interesting one, as does Ray Wise, but even these portrayals tend to shine only because what's around them is borderline dull. It does look nice though, where a very modernist sheen plays host to some shifty shenanigans. Perhaps it really is a simple case of too much compromise going on in here? Hell, Kaufman even changed the killer from that of the one in the novel. But considering the talent involved in the production and a fire-cracker source to work from, this really should have been much better. A wasted chance it remains. 4/10

    Around the period when Michael Crichton adaptations seemed to be the "it" thing (after the success of "Jurassic Park"), Crichton's "Rising Sun" would be the next one off the ranks this time by film-maker Philip Kaufman. Two cops, one an expert in the Japanese culture are put on the case of a dead woman found in a boardroom of a Japanese Los Angeles corporation building. It was quite a modest, if thinly plotted mystery thriller with an exceptional performance by Sean Connery. While the paranoid story was a manipulative puzzle with cultural, corporation and political subtexts, things just seem to happen with little depth to why and when answered it came off too easy. Sure it could be suspenseful, but the lead characters (Snipes and Connery) never felt like they were in any real sort of threat, because they knew what was coming (well more so Connery's character). Rarely does it create a false state of mind. Kaufman's slick direction of this highly produced production is economical, but his on cruise control directing from the stuffy script. Too bad because it's a fascinating set-up, but the execution for most part is thematically lukewarm. Wesley Snipes is workable across from Connery, forming a decent chemistry. Harvey Keitel provides some bite and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa the flair. Also the cast features Tia Carrere, Ray Wise and Mako. A diverting, but less than creative exercise.

    What could have been a tired entry in the buddy-buddy cop thriller genre turns into something else at the hands of expert director and craftsman Philip Kaufman (INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS). Sure, it's no masterpiece, but this adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel makes for compelling viewing, a fun entry in the East-meets-West sub-genre of the films detailing the conflict that arises when two different cultures are forced to come together. The plot is essentially that of a murder mystery, but with Crichton as source material there's the expected preoccupation with technology (a piece of CCTV footage plays a pivotal role here, throwing up questions as to privacy and manipulation, with the film feeling way ahead of its time some twenty years later). The presence of Wesley Snipes as the lead begs the question "miscasting?" but I found him on top form here and a damn sight better than he was in the same year's DEMOLITION MAN. Connery bags the best role and steals all of his scenes, while Harvey Keitel gives a volatile performance and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is a pleasure when he's given the chance to act (and not typecast as the villain, either). Altogether the culture clash plot kept me watching to the end and I wasn't disappointed.

    Rising Sun falls somewhere between buddy cop film and Neo-Noir murder mystery, and it doesn't work very well as either. The whole thing feels messy and and makes no sense. This movie demands more from the audience than it gives them. It's not an unwatchable movie, but it's never that interesting, or involving. Sean Connery and Westley Snipes are indeed a mix match, but they are so in the wrong way. Snipes goes through must of the picture being patronized by Connery's Zen Zinger persona. After a while the dynamic starts to become something like a father and child. Connery gets all the good lines, but he goes through the movie never having a moments concern or a sense of jeopardy. that and the Japanese experience of his Character lead me to believe that Steven Seagal may have been more at home in the role (which doesn't demand much). Come to think of it, nobody in the cast is especially that memorable. The pay off for the whole thing is kind of disappointing, partially because nothing really gets explained. when it's all over Rising Sun ends up being a rather bland over long endurance test.

    I basically watched this movie due to the fact that Toru Takemitsu for some reason got sucked into doing this ignorant film. If you have seen any of his work on Hiroshi Teshigahara's, Masaki Kobayashi's or Akira Kurosawa's films you know why I would be interested. From the opening credits I new this was going to be a train wreck when they decided to add Chinese gongs over Takemitsu's otherwise realistic Japanese style score, thus beginning the baffling ignorant betrayal of these Japanese people as sex crazed, backwards criminals whom only a westerner, well studied in Japanese culture can communicate with, as well as manipulate them like they were simpletons or something. I gather they even twisted Takemitsu's arm (who usually had a very minimalistic approach to scoring at key moments) into doing a continual Japanese score to remind us constantly that we are dealing with a mysterious and sinister culture here. Beyond this the acting is like what you would find in a a Jim Jarmusch film (ie: bad), and you can't help but feel sorry for Harvey Keitel who wouldn't be able to act badly if he tried, and Sean Connery and, well, the whole cast when you think about it, who are stuck with this director and script, both of which were not up to par with the ambition they were aiming for (I'm guessing intellectual thriller). Also, is it so hard to fly over some Japanese actors or find Japanese Americans for the parts instead of getting just any Asian? Bad accents galore! I must admit, I only watched about half an hour of it, but I can guess that it doesn't get any better later. Hell, I didn't really even care about the woman who was killed anyway.

    I watch this kind of movie for fun and suspend my disbelief. Rising Sun is not bad at all. It could have been much worse without Connery. I am not a big fan of oriental "wisdom" sound bites e.g. "Leave the cage door open the bird may return". Spoken by an unintelligent actor you don't like they become a lightening rod for all your ire. Fortunately Connery is not such an actor. The senior Japanese executives look like they have irritable bowel syndrome if they smiled their faces would crack. It is exaggerated and silly but for the most part the action keeps your interest. Although, at the end I got confused as to who killed the girl. I am still not sure. It is worth renting to pass a couple hours.

    It's obviously big-budget and well constructed, but the convoluted plot and epic two-hour duration cruel this Japanese-flavoured thriller that stars Sean Connery as an emeritus captain and specialist in Oriental custom, called in to assist the investigation of a murder in a foreign-owned corporation that is apparently concealing information to contain the scandal. Wesley Snipes is the younger brash detective who learns from Connery that there's more than one way to skin a cat when the cat isn't being co-operative. Tia Carrera co-stars in a fringe role as a visual editing specialist, brought into the investigation when it becomes apparent that CCTV footage of the incident has been doctored. Ray Wise ("Twin Peaks") plays a corrupt political candidate caught up in the affair, and Harvey Keitel, Stan Shaw and Mako all have significant supporting roles. Some lighthearted moments (Connery dispatches a couple of minders after he's manhandled and there's a running joke about Snipes' nickname of 'Cohai' akin to a trainee) punctuate what at times becomes little more than a forensic investigation of the CCTV DVD, such is the time dedicated to analysing its contents (and apparent omissions). Not only does the sun rise, but it will also set before you've finished watching this epic, though it offers an interesting cultural slant, can't justify the mammoth run-time.

    From director Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Right Stuff, Quills), I had probably heard of this or seen a poster, and it was interesting to hear the two stars in a film together, I was up for seeing what it was like. Basically during a party in a Japanese corporation at the office, a woman who obviously a professional escort is found dead, this is supposedly due to rough sex. Called in to investigate the death is police detective Lt. Webster Smith (Wesley Snipes), but he is called by someone who tells him that should pick up former police Captain and an expert on Japanese affairs, John Connor (Sir Sean Connery) (not to be confused with the saviour of mankind in the Terminator films, LOL). It looks like your average nothing out of the ordinary death, Smith is sure of this, but Connor is suspicious there may have been foul play, and there is evidence to suggest murder. Using sophisticated video technology the two detective looks back at the footage captured on CCTV, from inside and out of the party. They certainly prove that Eddie Sakamura (Licence to Kill's Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) had something to do with what happened to the hooker, he is the son of a wealthy Japanese businessman. By the end the conclusion is that she was indeed murdered by strangulation, but it is not the police who catch the criminal, it is Sakamura's friends who get him by burying him alive in wet cement, and all Connor and Smith can do is go there separate ways. Also starring Harvey Keitel as Lt. Tom Graham, True Lies' Tia Carrere as Jingo Asakuma, Tatjana Patitz as Cheryl Lynn Austin, Kevin Anderson as Bob Richmond, Mako as Yoshida-San, Ray Wise as Senator John Morton, Stan Egi as Ishihara and Steve Buscemi as Willy 'the Weasel' Wilhelm. Connery as usual gives a determined performance as the man who knows a lot about what is going on, and Snipes is alright as his partner getting his own ideas along the way, I will confess that I did not pay the fullest attention to what was going on, but it didn't really get what I watched anyway, it could have been a bit simpler, but it wasn't a bad thriller. Okay!

    Based on Crichton's novel of the same name, 'Rising Sun' is a Time-Pass fare, the doesn't falter as far as quick entertainment is concerned. The Fast-Pacing is spot-on & The Performances work! 'Rising Sun' Synopsis: When a professional escort is found dead, apparently after a violent sexual encounter, Police Detective Web Smith & John Connor, a former police Captain and expert on Japanese affairs, are sent to investigate. 'Rising Sun' is good stuff. It's Entertaining, Progressive & Fast-Paced. The Screenplay by Crichton & Michael Backes, is truly engaging & well-written. Philip Kaufman has Directed the film well. Cinematography is eye-filling. Editing is crisp. Art Design is fair. Performance-Wise: Sir Sean Connery & Wesley Snipes make superb screen-heroes & share an infectious chemistry throughout. Harvey Keitel is in excellent form. Tia Carrere does her bit well. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is effective. Ray Wise is decent. Steve Buscemi is as usual. On the whole, 'Rising Sun' is Entertaining.

    Very nice murder thriller, and arguably one of Wesley Snipes' best roles in his career. And of course, he didn't want to miss being paired with the man himself, Sean Connery! Tight direction, entertaining dialogues(especially Connery's yap on Japanese traditions are hilarious), the suspense and also intense performances from Connery & Snipes make this movie a winner. I wouldn't really regard Rising Sun as an action thriller because the action factor is low. But the movie amply compensates with tense moments. The only places where I feel our attention span drops are those kinda tediously long camera footages shown of the murder and all that explanation by the hot Tia Carrere on how the video was edited blah, blah! Verdict: Still, a highly engaging thriller. Racy & entertaining!

    Rising Sun is directed by Philip Kaufman who also co-writes with Michael Crichton and Michael Backes, with the adaptation coming form Crichton's own novel of the same name. It stars Sean Connery, Wesley Snipes, Harvey Keitel, Ray Wise and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. Music is by Tōru Takemitsu and cinematography by Michael Chapman. Story sees Capt. John Connor (Connery) and Lt. Webster "Web" Smith (Snipes) paired together to try and solve the mystery of a woman murdered at a Japanese high corporation party. With powerful people possibly involved and relations between the American and Japanese people starting to strain, Connor and Smith must crack the case sooner rather than later. A tough ask because there's the distinct whiff of a cover up in the air and only a grainy CCTV video as evidence to go on. It was a controversial novel, a best seller for sure, but Michael Crichton was accused of crafting an anti-Japanese diatribe, though in some quarters it was heralded as a wake up call that America was losing the business war to Japan. Even though Crichton was brought in to adapt the screenplay, it ultimately stands as Kaufman's work because alterations have been made to Crichton's text to balance out, as it were, the villainy/corruption quota between the two opposing cultures. The end result is a film that has no real urgency, excitement, tension or boldness; unless the sexual deviant behaviour of the poor lady murdered counts for the latter that is? Clearly Kaufman and Crichton are not meant to be, the former's stylish leanings can't harness the intricate paranoia from Crichton's page, which ultimately leaves us with a rather routine murder mystery. Shame, because the thirst third is pretty great stuff, visually arresting and with characters formed, story simmers nicely like it's going to boil over into murky intrigue and cross cultural bitterness. Sadly it doesn't. The director tries to beef things up with some nudity, confrontations and a number of shifty characters on the edges of the frame, but these only still further bring home just how ponderous the story actually is. There's no raising the pulse for the finale either, it may try and come off as an ambiguous tester, but ultimately it's lightweight and wasn't worth the wait. Cast wise Connery and Snipes work well together in that father figure/student way (or sempai/kohai to be exactly on plotting), but the former's gruff beefy charm is diluted and Snipes is given very little to do. Keitel turns in an interesting one, as does Ray Wise, but even these portrayals tend to shine only because what's around them is borderline dull. It does look nice though, where a very modernist sheen plays host to some shifty shenanigans. Perhaps it really is a simple case of too much compromise going on in here? Hell, Kaufman even changed the killer from that of the one in the novel. But considering the talent involved in the production and a fire-cracker source to work from, this really should have been much better. A wasted chance it remains. 4/10

    I basically watched this movie due to the fact that Toru Takemitsu for some reason got sucked into doing this ignorant film. If you have seen any of his work on Hiroshi Teshigahara's, Masaki Kobayashi's or Akira Kurosawa's films you know why I would be interested. From the opening credits I new this was going to be a train wreck when they decided to add Chinese gongs over Takemitsu's otherwise realistic Japanese style score, thus beginning the baffling ignorant betrayal of these Japanese people as sex crazed, backwards criminals whom only a westerner, well studied in Japanese culture can communicate with, as well as manipulate them like they were simpletons or something.

Cinematography is eye-filling. Editing is crisp. Art Design is fair. Performance-Wise: Sir Sean Connery & Wesley Snipes make superb screen-heroes & share an infectious chemistry throughout. Harvey Keitel is in excellent form. Tia Carrere does her bit well. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is effective. Ray Wise is decent. Steve Buscemi is as usual. On the whole, 'Rising Sun' is Entertaining.

    Very nice murder thriller, and arguably one of Wesley Snipes' best roles in his career. And of course, he didn't want to miss being paired with the man himself, Sean Connery! Tight direction, entertaining dialogues(especially Connery's yap on Japanese traditions are hilarious), the suspense and also intense performances from Connery & Snipes make this movie a winner. I wouldn't really regard Rising Sun as an action thriller because the action factor is low. But the movie amply compensates with tense moments. The only places where I feel our attention span drops are those kinda tediously long camera footages shown of the murder and all that explanation by the hot Tia Carrere on how the video was edited blah, blah! Verdict: Still, a highly engaging thriller. Racy & entertaining!

    Rising Sun is directed by Philip Kaufman who also co-writes with Michael Crichton and Michael Backes, with the adaptation coming form Crichton's own novel of the same name. It stars Sean Connery, Wesley Snipes, Harvey Keitel, Ray Wise and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. Music is by Tōru Takemitsu and cinematography by Michael Chapman. Story sees Capt. John Connor (Connery) and Lt. Webster "Web" Smith (Snipes) paired together to try and solve the mystery of a woman murdered at a Japanese high corporation party. With powerful people possibly involved and relations between the American and Japanese people starting to strain, Connor and Smith must crack the case sooner rather than later. A tough ask because there's the distinct whiff of a cover up in the air and only a grainy CCTV video as evidence to go on. It was a controversial novel, a best seller for sure, but Michael Crichton was accused of crafting an anti-Japanese diatribe, though in some quarters it was heralded as a wake up call that America was losing the business war to Japan. Even though Crichton was brought in to adapt the screenplay, it ultimately stands as Kaufman's work because alterations have been made to Crichton's text to balance out, as it were, the villainy/corruption quota between the two opposing cultures. The end result is a film that has no real urgency, excitement, tension or boldness; unless the sexual deviant behaviour of the poor lady murdered counts for the latter that is? Clearly Kaufman and Crichton are not meant to be, the former's stylish leanings can't harness the intricate paranoia from Crichton's page, which ultimately leaves us with a rather routine murder mystery. Shame, because the thirst third is pretty great stuff, visually arresting and with characters formed, story simmers nicely like it's going to boil over into murky intrigue and cross cultural bitterness. Sadly it doesn't. The director tries to beef things up with some nudity, confrontations and a number of shifty characters on the edges of the frame, but these only still further bring home just how ponderous the story actually is. There's no raising the pulse for the finale either, it may try and come off as an ambiguous tester, but ultimately it's lightweight and wasn't worth the wait. Cast wise Connery and Snipes work well together in that father figure/student way (or sempai/kohai to be exactly on plotting), but the former's gruff beefy charm is diluted and Snipes is given very little to do. Keitel turns in an interesting one, as does Ray Wise, but even these portrayals tend to shine only because what's around them is borderline dull. It does look nice though, where a very modernist sheen plays host to some shifty shenanigans. Perhaps it really is a simple case of too much compromise going on in here? Hell, Kaufman even changed the killer from that of the one in the novel. But considering the talent involved in the production and a fire-cracker source to work from, this really should have been much better. A wasted chance it remains. 4/10

    Around the period when Michael Crichton adaptations seemed to be the "it" thing (after the success of "Jurassic Park"), Crichton's "Rising Sun" would be the next one off the ranks this time by film-maker Philip Kaufman. Two cops, one an expert in the Japanese culture are put on the case of a dead woman found in a boardroom of a Japanese Los Angeles corporation building. It was quite a modest, if thinly plotted mystery thriller with an exceptional performance by Sean Connery. While the paranoid story was a manipulative puzzle with cultural, corporation and political subtexts, things just seem to happen with little depth to why and when answered it came off too easy. Sure it could be suspenseful, but the lead characters (Snipes and Connery) never felt like they were in any real sort of threat, because they knew what was coming (well more so Connery's character). Rarely does it create a false state of mind. Kaufman's slick direction of this highly produced production is economical, but his on cruise control directing from the stuffy script. Too bad because it's a fascinating set-up, but the execution for most part is thematically lukewarm. Wesley Snipes is workable across from Connery, forming a decent chemistry. Harvey Keitel provides some bite and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa the flair. Also the cast features Tia Carrere, Ray Wise and Mako. A diverting, but less than creative exercise.

    What could have been a tired entry in the buddy-buddy cop thriller genre turns into something else at the hands of expert director and craftsman Philip Kaufman (INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS). Sure, it's no masterpiece, but this adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel makes for compelling viewing, a fun entry in the East-meets-West sub-genre of the films detailing the conflict that arises when two different cultures are forced to come together. The plot is essentially that of a murder mystery, but with Crichton as source material there's the expected preoccupation with technology (a piece of CCTV footage plays a pivotal role here, throwing up questions as to privacy and manipulation, with the film feeling way ahead of its time some twenty years later). The presence of Wesley Snipes as the lead begs the question "miscasting?" but I found him on top form here and a damn sight better than he was in the same year's DEMOLITION MAN. Connery bags the best role and steals all of his scenes, while Harvey Keitel gives a volatile performance and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is a pleasure when he's given the chance to act (and not typecast as the villain, either). Altogether the culture clash plot kept me watching to the end and I wasn't disappointed.

    Rising Sun falls somewhere between buddy cop film and Neo-Noir murder mystery, and it doesn't work very well as either. The whole thing feels messy and and makes no sense. This movie demands more from the audience than it gives them. It's not an unwatchable movie, but it's never that interesting, or involving. Sean Connery and Westley Snipes are indeed a mix match, but they are so in the wrong way. Snipes goes through must of the picture being patronized by Connery's Zen Zinger persona. After a while the dynamic starts to become something like a father and child. Connery gets all the good lines, but he goes through the movie never having a moments concern or a sense of jeopardy. that and the Japanese experience of his Character lead me to believe that Steven Seagal may have been more at home in the role (which doesn't demand much). Come to think of it, nobody in the cast is especially that memorable. The pay off for the whole thing is kind of disappointing, partially because nothing really gets explained. when it's all over Rising Sun ends up being a rather bland over long endurance test.

    I basically watched this movie due to the fact that Toru Takemitsu for some reason got sucked into doing this ignorant film. If you have seen any of his work on Hiroshi Teshigahara's, Masaki Kobayashi's or Akira Kurosawa's films you know why I would be interested. From the opening credits I new this was going to be a train wreck when they decided to add Chinese gongs over Takemitsu's otherwise realistic Japanese style score, thus beginning the baffling ignorant betrayal of these Japanese people as sex crazed, backwards criminals whom only a westerner, well studied in Japanese culture can communicate with, as well as manipulate them like they were simpletons or something. I gather they even twisted Takemitsu's arm (who usually had a very minimalistic approach to scoring at key moments) into doing a continual Japanese score to remind us constantly that we are dealing with a mysterious and sinister culture here. Beyond this the acting is like what you would find in a a Jim Jarmusch film (ie: bad), and you can't help but feel sorry for Harvey Keitel who wouldn't be able to act badly if he tried, and Sean Connery and, well, the whole cast when you think about it, who are stuck with this director and script, both of which were not up to par with the ambition they were aiming for (I'm guessing intellectual thriller). Also, is it so hard to fly over some Japanese actors or find Japanese Americans for the parts instead of getting just any Asian? Bad accents galore! I must admit, I only watched about half an hour of it, but I can guess that it doesn't get any better later. Hell, I didn't really even care about the woman who was killed anyway.

    I watch this kind of movie for fun and suspend my disbelief. Rising Sun is not bad at all. It could have been much worse without Connery. I am not a big fan of oriental "wisdom" sound bites e.g. "Leave the cage door open the bird may return". Spoken by an unintelligent actor you don't like they become a lightening rod for all your ire. Fortunately Connery is not such an actor. The senior Japanese executives look like they have irritable bowel syndrome if they smiled their faces would crack. It is exaggerated and silly but for the most part the action keeps your interest. Although, at the end I got confused as to who killed the girl. I am still not sure. It is worth renting to pass a couple hours.

    It's obviously big-budget and well constructed, but the convoluted plot and epic two-hour duration cruel this Japanese-flavoured thriller that stars Sean Connery as an emeritus captain and specialist in Oriental custom, called in to assist the investigation of a murder in a foreign-owned corporation that is apparently concealing information to contain the scandal. Wesley Snipes is the younger brash detective who learns from Connery that there's more than one way to skin a cat when the cat isn't being co-operative. Tia Carrera co-stars in a fringe role as a visual editing specialist, brought into the investigation when it becomes apparent that CCTV footage of the incident has been doctored. Ray Wise ("Twin Peaks") plays a corrupt political candidate caught up in the affair, and Harvey Keitel, Stan Shaw and Mako all have significant supporting roles. Some lighthearted moments (Connery dispatches a couple of minders after he's manhandled and there's a running joke about Snipes' nickname of 'Cohai' akin to a trainee) punctuate what at times becomes little more than a forensic investigation of the CCTV DVD, such is the time dedicated to analysing its contents (and apparent omissions). Not only does the sun rise, but it will also set before you've finished watching this epic, though it offers an interesting cultural slant, can't justify the mammoth run-time.

    From director Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Right Stuff, Quills), I had probably heard of this or seen a poster, and it was interesting to hear the two stars in a film together, I was up for seeing what it was like. Basically during a party in a Japanese corporation at the office, a woman who obviously a professional escort is found dead, this is supposedly due to rough sex. Called in to investigate the death is police detective Lt. Webster Smith (Wesley Snipes), but he is called by someone who tells him that should pick up former police Captain and an expert on Japanese affairs, John Connor (Sir Sean Connery) (not to be confused with the saviour of mankind in the Terminator films, LOL). It looks like your average nothing out of the ordinary death, Smith is sure of this, but Connor is suspicious there may have been foul play, and there is evidence to suggest murder. Using sophisticated video technology the two detective looks back at the footage captured on CCTV, from inside and out of the party. They certainly prove that Eddie Sakamura (Licence to Kill's Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) had something to do with what happened to the hooker, he is the son of a wealthy Japanese businessman. By the end the conclusion is that she was indeed murdered by strangulation, but it is not the police who catch the criminal, it is Sakamura's friends who get him by burying him alive in wet cement, and all Connor and Smith can do is go there separate ways. Also starring Harvey Keitel as Lt. Tom Graham, True Lies' Tia Carrere as Jingo Asakuma, Tatjana Patitz as Cheryl Lynn Austin, Kevin Anderson as Bob Richmond, Mako as Yoshida-San, Ray Wise as Senator John Morton, Stan Egi as Ishihara and Steve Buscemi as Willy 'the Weasel' Wilhelm. Connery as usual gives a determined performance as the man who knows a lot about what is going on, and Snipes is alright as his partner getting his own ideas along the way, I will confess that I did not pay the fullest attention to what was going on, but it didn't really get what I watched anyway, it could have been a bit simpler, but it wasn't a bad thriller. Okay!

    Based on Crichton's novel of the same name, 'Rising Sun' is a Time-Pass fare, the doesn't falter as far as quick entertainment is concerned. The Fast-Pacing is spot-on & The Performances work! 'Rising Sun' Synopsis: When a professional escort is found dead, apparently after a violent sexual encounter, Police Detective Web Smith & John Connor, a former police Captain and expert on Japanese affairs, are sent to investigate. 'Rising Sun' is good stuff. It's Entertaining, Progressive & Fast-Paced. The Screenplay by Crichton & Michael Backes, is truly engaging & well-written. Philip Kaufman has Directed the film well. Cinematography is eye-filling. Editing is crisp. Art Design is fair. Performance-Wise: Sir Sean Connery & Wesley Snipes make superb screen-heroes & share an infectious chemistry throughout.
