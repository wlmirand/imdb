    I was pretty impressed by John Woo's Face Off, which was a very entertaining action film with a nice cast so I was curious to check out his early work. The action sequences are handled very well in The Killer, but at the same time I felt they were were a bit uninspired. There are plenty of shootout moments here, but I found them quite repetitive and not necessarily entertaining. Also, I had problems with the editing, which was awkward at times. As for the acting, the leads do an okay job but didn't seem so convincing in the more dramatic scenes for me. Overall, The Killer was a bit disappointing experience but an enjoyable mess nevertheless.

    Once I showed this film to a friend I asked him what he thought of it, and he said: "10 out of 10 for what it was/is." I did not like that remark cause you rate every movie for what it is and not only action shoot em up bullet feasts. In action movies you are to find action in some bad story with uninteresting characters. In Hard boiled you are to find great drama such as friendship and honor within the action so instead of action in story we get story in action and having the leads being played by the two greatest HK actors around doesn't harm non to much either. You could actually make a top 5 greatest shoot out scenes of all time and get away using only scenes from Hard boiled, they are all that good. The most technically challenging and most impressive set piece in the film must be the 2minutes and 40seconds long tracking shot that they had to re-shoot just about six times before they could move on. This is a great, great, great film and should be treated with all the amount of respect as let say, a film like the godfather would get. Cause remember film snobs does not love films but instead they love films that are quote, unquote: "serious." I, myself took this film seriously and look what I got out of it. A must see. 10/10 Masterpiece.

    I watched this and this was one of the greatest action movies ever and it starred Chow Yun Fat who is awesome as Inspector 'Tequila' Yuen a gun-fighting cop with pretty reflexes to match his gun skills and attitude! This was a great action cop movie! The action scenes are nothing short of thrilling which is what I expect of John Woo films and the story was pretty decent. Also Chow Yun Fat has other actors backing him up not just the interesting villains of this movie but also Tequila's colleagues who are shown including his boss Superintendent Pang! This is among my personal top 20 of greatest ever action movies! This is a true action classic!

    If a work of art takes it over the top, so to speak, and suddenly that strata becomes the new norm, "authenticity" can become a murky issue. Is Hard Boiled just another brainless action movie, or is it THE brainless action movie, something that should have stood alone as the final statement of that sort of thing? A lot of conventions are introduced here: the role of the police officer is distilled into "the good guy with a gun", sort of a modern lone ranger. Even in Dirty Harry, there were hints that Callahan might have occasionally made arrests and done various "policey" things from time to time--but not here, oh no. It's all just metaphor, a gloriously black and white blood opera that hooks you on a sense of righteousness you'd balk at in a more sensible state of mind. In many ways it's more a continuation of martial arts and chivalrous swordplay movies than anything crime related. Think about it--teahouse battles, people shooting (stabbing) through themselves to hit someone holding them, etc... all Shaw Bros and Golden Harvest stuff. After hundreds of inferior copycats, Hard Boiled begs to be understood in terms of its initial cultural context. However, something about its execution is clearly authentic. The plot is a tad less purposeful than Woo's previous films, actually stitched together and made up out of thin air from various stages of shooting; it shows, but the spontaneity often works in its favor. Why does the bad guy have an impossible secret armoury beneath the hospital? Why not? Patients make good potential hostages. Woo logic. What was the likelihood of those doctors successfully resuscitating that little girl during a Mexican standoff in The Killer? Well, they did, and that's what matters. If you have to ask these questions, you're watching these movies for the wrong reasons. Woo's cloying, ultra-melodramatic, but somehow effective and charming sentimentalism is dialled down a bit, though still present. Typical themes of honor and conflicted loyalties inform the action, but this is more a movie about "moments" than anything: Chow Yun-fat sliding through a table of flour at the end of the birdcage teahouse shootout, appearing next to his victim like a ghost and exacting immediate revenge for a fallen comrade; several minute hallway shootouts without cuts; Tony Leung assassinating his target with a gun hidden in a Shakespeare anthology; Chow Yun-fat on his trail, matching books with the rectangular clean spot in the blood splatter, etc. There was always a certain physicality to Woo's otherwise flagrantly unrealistic "gun ballet" acts that imitators never quite captured. Weaponry has a sense of weight; explosions, ballistics and broken glass seem to pose an actual threat; even real babies (as manipulative of a metaphor as that might be) are thrown in harm's way. Basically, if it all seems a little stupid to you, that's because this is the first movie to really take it to this level, nitwit! Sadly, they'll never make them like this again, so you might as well realize Hollywood blockbusters are a waste of time, hire a hypnotist who can make you forget about Hard Boiled, and rewatch it 100 times. By the way, at least "heart-on-sleeve" implies that the sleeve in question isn't blocked by a limp wrist.

    Some guy quoted on the back of the cover to this movie: "John Woo is God." Well, he's not God, and he's not even a god, he is just a human being like the rest of us, fallible. This movie though is extraordinary and leaves many Hollywood movies for dead. Even John Woo's Hollywood productions come no where near to this movie. Not only is it almost non-stop action, but the characters in this movie are real, breathing, and in some ways, very tragic. The tragic nature of Tony is something that one very rarely sees in a Hollywood movie, but is very relevant in Hong Kong. This movie is about a cop named Tequila (Chow-Yun-Fat) who is caught in a gun fight in a tea house when he attempts to stop an illegal gun deal going down. This fight is fast, furious, has a huge body-count, and stabs you in the heart as Tequila's partner is gunned down. This is no ordinary Hollywood gunfight, this is one with guts. One of the themes of this movie is loneliness. Tequilla is a major character but the movie deals more with Tony, an undercover cop who is trying to bust open a triad gang's gunrunning scheme. Tony is a lonely man whom nobody really knows. He has no identity and only one person knows his birthday and that is his commanding officer. Tony wanted to be a police officer but he never thought that he would be placed in such a situation. He has to kill for if he does not his cover will be blown, and with this killing he must also betray close friends. He is told by Mr Hoi not to trust Johnny Wong and it is Johnny Wong who he throws his lot in with in the end. Johnny Wong is also a very interesting character. He goes beyond being a bad guy to being outright sadistic. John Woo is known to make his characters all bad, Tequilla is one such character that even though he is a cop, he has a very nasty, annoying streak through him. The only truly honourable man in this movie is Tony. Johnny Wong though is far more evil than most bad guys that I have seen. This comes to the point of where you draw the line, and I think Woo is trying to help us think of where this line is, or if there is any. Wong goes to the point where his loyal henchmen begin to question his actions because he is doing things that not even they would do. Hard Boiled is seriously nothing short of brilliant. It has the longest gunfight that I have seen in any movie, and there isn't even a pause for breath. Unlike movies like the Killer and Face Off where there is a slow bit and then the action takes off, Hard Boiled just seems speed by yet giving enough time to develop the characters brilliantly. The only problem is that the subtitles suck.

    This movie is a hard-core action film by John Woo about a dirty harry type cop, tequila (Chow Yun-Fat) who's partner is killed in action during the exposition, and has a vendetta by taking down the Chinese mob with help from one of the mob's highest ranking assassins who is secretly a troubled undercover cop. The action scenes really blew my mind away, I mean completely. Especially the teahouse and the hospital scenes. It's gun-fu basically. This movie has a very high body count due to the lengthy action scenes. The hospital action scene actually lasts more than a half hour. This is not JUST your typical action movie. This movie truly is a epitome of bloodshed and glorification of violence. The action scenes are actually the main emphasis of the film because the action is pure art. The story is pretty generic and straightforward, but performances by the actors are actually very good because you sympathize with the characters and their problems in life. In general, this is one of the best action films ever made and deserves equal recognition with movies, such as face/off and die hard.

    Another crime drama from writer-director John Woo, Hard Boiled has the same formula, with lots of violent and bloody action. Back to the usual Hong Kong setting, as officer Yuen, and his partner, Benny, get into a shootout with a bunch of gun smugglers in which Benny is killed. Yuen wants revenge on the gangster who killed his coworker, but his commander removes him from the case. An undercover cop named Tony is working for a mobster, Hoi, who he turns against when seeking a better deal. A gang war unfolds and Yuen finds out that Tony is crooked. The climax occurs when Yuen tracks down a large cache of weapons to a hospital. Of course, Woo uses the long corridors of the hospital to his advantage, when the police and the bad guys get into an extended shootout. The result looks like a video game, with the camera following the cops up and down the hallways in an uber kill mode. Once again, Woo has created a top notch thriller with walk to wall adventures.

    Yes, John Woo is terrific director. At my opinion he was at his best in this mind blowing, kicked-ass action package. Everything that he has done before, and I mean particularly on A Better Tomorrow and The Killer reached its culmination in Hard Boiled. In fact, when John Woo completed this film, he went in U.S, later directed Hard Target, Face Off, which were a little bit disappointing compared to his Hong-Kong work. Yes, there is massive amount of shootouts, graphic violence, explosions doves(symbol of piece), gun play(Mexican stand-off). Everything in John Woo's style. But the shooting is amazingly choreographed. Strongly stylized. Lots of special effects, explosions, glass shattering. Looks and sounds so real. I never have seen it so in an action film. Bad things are choppy and ludicrous story, terrible dubbing and soundtrack as well the thing that irritated me most(but not enough to hate the movie). It is like a video game where some people get shot several times and then walk and shoot like nothing happened. Those guys(especially villains) sometimes looks so invulnerable. At the end, Hard Boiled is masterpiece for action films. Loud, exciting, amazing, but with few oversights. i strongly recommended the movie for all action fans if they had not see it, to see. And enjoy!

    There is really no need to discuss plot. Plot isn't a device that Woo uses particularly well and that is actually a positive attribute of a film like this. The story is serviceable enough but it isn't overly complicated to get in the way of the action. And let's not mince words, the action is the real star of this show. Chow Yun Fat oozes cool and he is given some incredible action set pieces to look cool on. I prefer A Better Tomorrow over this film but don't think that is anything more than subjective opinion - this is an amazing action film that most any fan of gun fights and explosions will enjoy to the fullest. You essentially get two hours of some of the greatest action sequences ever filmed. The opening scene in the Chinese tea house has to be seen to be believed and I won't even mention the finale. Just know that it defies description. Watch this film soon, might become a new favorite. And you will most likely develop a man crush on Chow Yun Fat.

    John Woo is of course a legend for the Hong Kong film industry and one of the great action directors because of his heroic bloodshed genre he created. Hard Boiled is considered one of his best and it is certainly a very entertaining film just for its action scenes. Officer "Tequlia" Yuen (Chow Yun-Fat) is a Hong Kong police detective whom partner gets killed in a restaurant shoot out and he sets out to get the Triad leader that was responsible, Johnny Wong (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang). But when his boss Superintendent Pang (Philip Chan) orders Tequlia to stop his investigation, so he goes on a one man war against the Triads. Johnny has also recruited a top assassin and enforcer, Tony (Tony Leung). But it turns out he has his own secret and Tequlia and Tony ends up working to together bring down Johnny. Hard Boiled is around three major action set pieces, each getting bigger then the previous one. They were inventive and bloody. The restaurant had a tense had a tense build up with the boiling kettles, the police on there stake out and it became a big shoot out in a tight location and many innocent people get killed. It was almost like a Bruce Lee film, particularly with the score. The warehouse was just fun seeing men riding around on motorbikes, shooting people and also shows how one man could take on a small army. And the hospital set piece is just a massive pitch battle between the police and Triads, it was almost epic in scale because of the amounts of explosions, blood and bullets flying about. Whilst Woo does overuse slow motion and bullet sparks sometimes he does know how to craft an action scene, knowing where to focus, how to edit so you could follow what happens. I particularly like the long tracking shots in the hospital as all the action and carnage goes on all round, focusing on our two heroes. It is also very refreshing to see a film that does not need CGI, a film that actually uses stunt work and real special effects and it was shot very much like other action films from the 80s and 90s using a rather dark filter to it and most of the action takes place at night. Woo knows how to move the camera and does bring to live his own sense of hyper-realism. Hong Kong detectives seem to be very trigger happy. The plot itself is simply but Woo does not treat the audience like idiots. It is simply a tough cop going by his own rules and sets out to bring down a Triad boss any way possible. Chow Yun-Fat plays the role very well and his character is shown to be tough, ruthless cop who does have guilt about the lost of partner. He is also shown to have good with Teresa Mo as they sing pop songs together as they decode a message from a undercover police officer. The whole undercover police officer subplot who has to do violence acts reminded me of Infernal Affairs but it possibly because that film was also set in Hong Kong. Hard Boiled does suffers from some cop film clich&eacute;s, particularly the police chief telling his rouge officer but this is a very well made, entertaining action film. This is a film that has a lot of John Woo's traits like slow-mo, reflections, gun-fu especially using two guns at once and playing soft music over a bloody action scene (a trick he used in Face/Off).

    Another crime drama from writer-director John Woo, Hard Boiled has the same formula, with lots of violent and bloody action. Back to the usual Hong Kong setting, as officer Yuen, and his partner, Benny, get into a shootout with a bunch of gun smugglers in which Benny is killed. Yuen wants revenge on the gangster who killed his coworker, but his commander removes him from the case. An undercover cop named Tony is working for a mobster, Hoi, who he turns against when seeking a better deal. A gang war unfolds and Yuen finds out that Tony is crooked. The climax occurs when Yuen tracks down a large cache of weapons to a hospital. Of course, Woo uses the long corridors of the hospital to his advantage, when the police and the bad guys get into an extended shootout. The result looks like a video game, with the camera following the cops up and down the hallways in an uber kill mode. Once again, Woo has created a top notch thriller with walk to wall adventures.

    Yes, John Woo is terrific director. At my opinion he was at his best in this mind blowing, kicked-ass action package. Everything that he has done before, and I mean particularly on A Better Tomorrow and The Killer reached its culmination in Hard Boiled. In fact, when John Woo completed this film, he went in U.S, later directed Hard Target, Face Off, which were a little bit disappointing compared to his Hong-Kong work. Yes, there is massive amount of shootouts, graphic violence, explosions doves(symbol of piece), gun play(Mexican stand-off). Everything in John Woo's style. But the shooting is amazingly choreographed. Strongly stylized. Lots of special effects, explosions, glass shattering. Looks and sounds so real. I never have seen it so in an action film. Bad things are choppy and ludicrous story, terrible dubbing and soundtrack as well the thing that irritated me most(but not enough to hate the movie). It is like a video game where some people get shot several times and then walk and shoot like nothing happened. Those guys(especially villains) sometimes looks so invulnerable. At the end, Hard Boiled is masterpiece for action films. Loud, exciting, amazing, but with few oversights. i strongly recommended the movie for all action fans if they had not see it, to see. And enjoy!

    There is really no need to discuss plot. Plot isn't a device that Woo uses particularly well and that is actually a positive attribute of a film like this. The story is serviceable enough but it isn't overly complicated to get in the way of the action. And let's not mince words, the action is the real star of this show. Chow Yun Fat oozes cool and he is given some incredible action set pieces to look cool on. I prefer A Better Tomorrow over this film but don't think that is anything more than subjective opinion - this is an amazing action film that most any fan of gun fights and explosions will enjoy to the fullest. You essentially get two hours of some of the greatest action sequences ever filmed. The opening scene in the Chinese tea house has to be seen to be believed and I won't even mention the finale. Just know that it defies description. Watch this film soon, might become a new favorite. And you will most likely develop a man crush on Chow Yun Fat.

    John Woo is of course a legend for the Hong Kong film industry and one of the great action directors because of his heroic bloodshed genre he created. Hard Boiled is considered one of his best and it is certainly a very entertaining film just for its action scenes. Officer "Tequlia" Yuen (Chow Yun-Fat) is a Hong Kong police detective whom partner gets killed in a restaurant shoot out and he sets out to get the Triad leader that was responsible, Johnny Wong (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang). But when his boss Superintendent Pang (Philip Chan) orders Tequlia to stop his investigation, so he goes on a one man war against the Triads. Johnny has also recruited a top assassin and enforcer, Tony (Tony Leung). But it turns out he has his own secret and Tequlia and Tony ends up working to together bring down Johnny. Hard Boiled is around three major action set pieces, each getting bigger then the previous one. They were inventive and bloody. The restaurant had a tense had a tense build up with the boiling kettles, the police on there stake out and it became a big shoot out in a tight location and many innocent people get killed. It was almost like a Bruce Lee film, particularly with the score. The warehouse was just fun seeing men riding around on motorbikes, shooting people and also shows how one man could take on a small army. And the hospital set piece is just a massive pitch battle between the police and Triads, it was almost epic in scale because of the amounts of explosions, blood and bullets flying about. Whilst Woo does overuse slow motion and bullet sparks sometimes he does know how to craft an action scene, knowing where to focus, how to edit so you could follow what happens. I particularly like the long tracking shots in the hospital as all the action and carnage goes on all round, focusing on our two heroes. It is also very refreshing to see a film that does not need CGI, a film that actually uses stunt work and real special effects and it was shot very much like other action films from the 80s and 90s using a rather dark filter to it and most of the action takes place at night. Woo knows how to move the camera and does bring to live his own sense of hyper-realism. Hong Kong detectives seem to be very trigger happy. The plot itself is simply but Woo does not treat the audience like idiots. It is simply a tough cop going by his own rules and sets out to bring down a Triad boss any way possible. Chow Yun-Fat plays the role very well and his character is shown to be tough, ruthless cop who does have guilt about the lost of partner. He is also shown to have good with Teresa Mo as they sing pop songs together as they decode a message from a undercover police officer. The whole undercover police officer subplot who has to do violence acts reminded me of Infernal Affairs but it possibly because that film was also set in Hong Kong. Hard Boiled does suffers from some cop film clich&eacute;s, particularly the police chief telling his rouge officer but this is a very well made, entertaining action film. This is a film that has a lot of John Woo's traits like slow-mo, reflections, gun-fu especially using two guns at once and playing soft music over a bloody action scene (a trick he used in Face/Off).

    I was pretty impressed by John Woo's Face Off, which was a very entertaining action film with a nice cast so I was curious to check out his early work. The action sequences are handled very well in The Killer, but at the same time I felt they were were a bit uninspired. There are plenty of shootout moments here, but I found them quite repetitive and not necessarily entertaining. Also, I had problems with the editing, which was awkward at times. As for the acting, the leads do an okay job but didn't seem so convincing in the more dramatic scenes for me. Overall, The Killer was a bit disappointing experience but an enjoyable mess nevertheless.

    Once I showed this film to a friend I asked him what he thought of it, and he said: "10 out of 10 for what it was/is." I did not like that remark cause you rate every movie for what it is and not only action shoot em up bullet feasts. In action movies you are to find action in some bad story with uninteresting characters. In Hard boiled you are to find great drama such as friendship and honor within the action so instead of action in story we get story in action and having the leads being played by the two greatest HK actors around doesn't harm non to much either. You could actually make a top 5 greatest shoot out scenes of all time and get away using only scenes from Hard boiled, they are all that good. The most technically challenging and most impressive set piece in the film must be the 2minutes and 40seconds long tracking shot that they had to re-shoot just about six times before they could move on. This is a great, great, great film and should be treated with all the amount of respect as let say, a film like the godfather would get. Cause remember film snobs does not love films but instead they love films that are quote, unquote: "serious." I, myself took this film seriously and look what I got out of it. A must see. 10/10 Masterpiece.

    I watched this and this was one of the greatest action movies ever and it starred Chow Yun Fat who is awesome as Inspector 'Tequila' Yuen a gun-fighting cop with pretty reflexes to match his gun skills and attitude! This was a great action cop movie! The action scenes are nothing short of thrilling which is what I expect of John Woo films and the story was pretty decent. Also Chow Yun Fat has other actors backing him up not just the interesting villains of this movie but also Tequila's colleagues who are shown including his boss Superintendent Pang! This is among my personal top 20 of greatest ever action movies! This is a true action classic!

    If a work of art takes it over the top, so to speak, and suddenly that strata becomes the new norm, "authenticity" can become a murky issue. Is Hard Boiled just another brainless action movie, or is it THE brainless action movie, something that should have stood alone as the final statement of that sort of thing? A lot of conventions are introduced here: the role of the police officer is distilled into "the good guy with a gun", sort of a modern lone ranger. Even in Dirty Harry, there were hints that Callahan might have occasionally made arrests and done various "policey" things from time to time--but not here, oh no. It's all just metaphor, a gloriously black and white blood opera that hooks you on a sense of righteousness you'd balk at in a more sensible state of mind. In many ways it's more a continuation of martial arts and chivalrous swordplay movies than anything crime related. Think about it--teahouse battles, people shooting (stabbing) through themselves to hit someone holding them, etc... all Shaw Bros and Golden Harvest stuff. After hundreds of inferior copycats, Hard Boiled begs to be understood in terms of its initial cultural context. However, something about its execution is clearly authentic. The plot is a tad less purposeful than Woo's previous films, actually stitched together and made up out of thin air from various stages of shooting; it shows, but the spontaneity often works in its favor. Why does the bad guy have an impossible secret armoury beneath the hospital? Why not? Patients make good potential hostages. Woo logic. What was the likelihood of those doctors successfully resuscitating that little girl during a Mexican standoff in The Killer? Well, they did, and that's what matters. If you have to ask these questions, you're watching these movies for the wrong reasons. Woo's cloying, ultra-melodramatic, but somehow effective and charming sentimentalism is dialled down a bit, though still present. Typical themes of honor and conflicted loyalties inform the action, but this is more a movie about "moments" than anything: Chow Yun-fat sliding through a table of flour at the end of the birdcage teahouse shootout, appearing next to his victim like a ghost and exacting immediate revenge for a fallen comrade; several minute hallway shootouts without cuts; Tony Leung assassinating his target with a gun hidden in a Shakespeare anthology; Chow Yun-fat on his trail, matching books with the rectangular clean spot in the blood splatter, etc. There was always a certain physicality to Woo's otherwise flagrantly unrealistic "gun ballet" acts that imitators never quite captured. Weaponry has a sense of weight; explosions, ballistics and broken glass seem to pose an actual threat; even real babies (as manipulative of a metaphor as that might be) are thrown in harm's way. Basically, if it all seems a little stupid to you, that's because this is the first movie to really take it to this level, nitwit! Sadly, they'll never make them like this again, so you might as well realize Hollywood blockbusters are a waste of time, hire a hypnotist who can make you forget about Hard Boiled, and rewatch it 100 times. By the way, at least "heart-on-sleeve" implies that the sleeve in question isn't blocked by a limp wrist.

    Some guy quoted on the back of the cover to this movie: "John Woo is God." Well, he's not God, and he's not even a god, he is just a human being like the rest of us, fallible. This movie though is extraordinary and leaves many Hollywood movies for dead. Even John Woo's Hollywood productions come no where near to this movie. Not only is it almost non-stop action, but the characters in this movie are real, breathing, and in some ways, very tragic. The tragic nature of Tony is something that one very rarely sees in a Hollywood movie, but is very relevant in Hong Kong. This movie is about a cop named Tequila (Chow-Yun-Fat) who is caught in a gun fight in a tea house when he attempts to stop an illegal gun deal going down. This fight is fast, furious, has a huge body-count, and stabs you in the heart as Tequila's partner is gunned down. This is no ordinary Hollywood gunfight, this is one with guts. One of the themes of this movie is loneliness. Tequilla is a major character but the movie deals more with Tony, an undercover cop who is trying to bust open a triad gang's gunrunning scheme. Tony is a lonely man whom nobody really knows. He has no identity and only one person knows his birthday and that is his commanding officer. Tony wanted to be a police officer but he never thought that he would be placed in such a situation. He has to kill for if he does not his cover will be blown, and with this killing he must also betray close friends. He is told by Mr Hoi not to trust Johnny Wong and it is Johnny Wong who he throws his lot in with in the end. Johnny Wong is also a very interesting character. He goes beyond being a bad guy to being outright sadistic. John Woo is known to make his characters all bad, Tequilla is one such character that even though he is a cop, he has a very nasty, annoying streak through him. The only truly honourable man in this movie is Tony. Johnny Wong though is far more evil than most bad guys that I have seen. This comes to the point of where you draw the line, and I think Woo is trying to help us think of where this line is, or if there is any. Wong goes to the point where his loyal henchmen begin to question his actions because he is doing things that not even they would do. Hard Boiled is seriously nothing short of brilliant. It has the longest gunfight that I have seen in any movie, and there isn't even a pause for breath. Unlike movies like the Killer and Face Off where there is a slow bit and then the action takes off, Hard Boiled just seems speed by yet giving enough time to develop the characters brilliantly. The only problem is that the subtitles suck.

    This movie is a hard-core action film by John Woo about a dirty harry type cop, tequila (Chow Yun-Fat) who's partner is killed in action during the exposition, and has a vendetta by taking down the Chinese mob with help from one of the mob's highest ranking assassins who is secretly a troubled undercover cop. The action scenes really blew my mind away, I mean completely. Especially the teahouse and the hospital scenes. It's gun-fu basically. This movie has a very high body count due to the lengthy action scenes. The hospital action scene actually lasts more than a half hour. This is not JUST your typical action movie. This movie truly is a epitome of bloodshed and glorification of violence. The action scenes are actually the main emphasis of the film because the action is pure art. The story is pretty generic and straightforward, but performances by the actors are actually very good because you sympathize with the characters and their problems in life. In general, this is one of the best action films ever made and deserves equal recognition with movies, such as face/off and die hard.

Weaponry has a sense of weight; explosions, ballistics and broken glass seem to pose an actual threat; even real babies (as manipulative of a metaphor as that might be) are thrown in harm's way. Basically, if it all seems a little stupid to you, that's because this is the first movie to really take it to this level, nitwit! Sadly, they'll never make them like this again, so you might as well realize Hollywood blockbusters are a waste of time, hire a hypnotist who can make you forget about Hard Boiled, and rewatch it 100 times. By the way, at least "heart-on-sleeve" implies that the sleeve in question isn't blocked by a limp wrist.

    Some guy quoted on the back of the cover to this movie: "John Woo is God." Well, he's not God, and he's not even a god, he is just a human being like the rest of us, fallible. This movie though is extraordinary and leaves many Hollywood movies for dead. Even John Woo's Hollywood productions come no where near to this movie. Not only is it almost non-stop action, but the characters in this movie are real, breathing, and in some ways, very tragic. The tragic nature of Tony is something that one very rarely sees in a Hollywood movie, but is very relevant in Hong Kong. This movie is about a cop named Tequila (Chow-Yun-Fat) who is caught in a gun fight in a tea house when he attempts to stop an illegal gun deal going down. This fight is fast, furious, has a huge body-count, and stabs you in the heart as Tequila's partner is gunned down. This is no ordinary Hollywood gunfight, this is one with guts. One of the themes of this movie is loneliness. Tequilla is a major character but the movie deals more with Tony, an undercover cop who is trying to bust open a triad gang's gunrunning scheme. Tony is a lonely man whom nobody really knows. He has no identity and only one person knows his birthday and that is his commanding officer. Tony wanted to be a police officer but he never thought that he would be placed in such a situation. He has to kill for if he does not his cover will be blown, and with this killing he must also betray close friends. He is told by Mr Hoi not to trust Johnny Wong and it is Johnny Wong who he throws his lot in with in the end. Johnny Wong is also a very interesting character. He goes beyond being a bad guy to being outright sadistic. John Woo is known to make his characters all bad, Tequilla is one such character that even though he is a cop, he has a very nasty, annoying streak through him. The only truly honourable man in this movie is Tony. Johnny Wong though is far more evil than most bad guys that I have seen. This comes to the point of where you draw the line, and I think Woo is trying to help us think of where this line is, or if there is any. Wong goes to the point where his loyal henchmen begin to question his actions because he is doing things that not even they would do. Hard Boiled is seriously nothing short of brilliant. It has the longest gunfight that I have seen in any movie, and there isn't even a pause for breath. Unlike movies like the Killer and Face Off where there is a slow bit and then the action takes off, Hard Boiled just seems speed by yet giving enough time to develop the characters brilliantly. The only problem is that the subtitles suck.

    This movie is a hard-core action film by John Woo about a dirty harry type cop, tequila (Chow Yun-Fat) who's partner is killed in action during the exposition, and has a vendetta by taking down the Chinese mob with help from one of the mob's highest ranking assassins who is secretly a troubled undercover cop. The action scenes really blew my mind away, I mean completely. Especially the teahouse and the hospital scenes. It's gun-fu basically. This movie has a very high body count due to the lengthy action scenes. The hospital action scene actually lasts more than a half hour. This is not JUST your typical action movie. This movie truly is a epitome of bloodshed and glorification of violence. The action scenes are actually the main emphasis of the film because the action is pure art. The story is pretty generic and straightforward, but performances by the actors are actually very good because you sympathize with the characters and their problems in life. In general, this is one of the best action films ever made and deserves equal recognition with movies, such as face/off and die hard.

    Another crime drama from writer-director John Woo, Hard Boiled has the same formula, with lots of violent and bloody action. Back to the usual Hong Kong setting, as officer Yuen, and his partner, Benny, get into a shootout with a bunch of gun smugglers in which Benny is killed. Yuen wants revenge on the gangster who killed his coworker, but his commander removes him from the case. An undercover cop named Tony is working for a mobster, Hoi, who he turns against when seeking a better deal. A gang war unfolds and Yuen finds out that Tony is crooked. The climax occurs when Yuen tracks down a large cache of weapons to a hospital. Of course, Woo uses the long corridors of the hospital to his advantage, when the police and the bad guys get into an extended shootout. The result looks like a video game, with the camera following the cops up and down the hallways in an uber kill mode. Once again, Woo has created a top notch thriller with walk to wall adventures.

    Yes, John Woo is terrific director. At my opinion he was at his best in this mind blowing, kicked-ass action package. Everything that he has done before, and I mean particularly on A Better Tomorrow and The Killer reached its culmination in Hard Boiled. In fact, when John Woo completed this film, he went in U.S, later directed Hard Target, Face Off, which were a little bit disappointing compared to his Hong-Kong work. Yes, there is massive amount of shootouts, graphic violence, explosions doves(symbol of piece), gun play(Mexican stand-off). Everything in John Woo's style. But the shooting is amazingly choreographed. Strongly stylized. Lots of special effects, explosions, glass shattering. Looks and sounds so real. I never have seen it so in an action film. Bad things are choppy and ludicrous story, terrible dubbing and soundtrack as well the thing that irritated me most(but not enough to hate the movie). It is like a video game where some people get shot several times and then walk and shoot like nothing happened. Those guys(especially villains) sometimes looks so invulnerable. At the end, Hard Boiled is masterpiece for action films. Loud, exciting, amazing, but with few oversights. i strongly recommended the movie for all action fans if they had not see it, to see. And enjoy!

    There is really no need to discuss plot. Plot isn't a device that Woo uses particularly well and that is actually a positive attribute of a film like this. The story is serviceable enough but it isn't overly complicated to get in the way of the action. And let's not mince words, the action is the real star of this show. Chow Yun Fat oozes cool and he is given some incredible action set pieces to look cool on. I prefer A Better Tomorrow over this film but don't think that is anything more than subjective opinion - this is an amazing action film that most any fan of gun fights and explosions will enjoy to the fullest. You essentially get two hours of some of the greatest action sequences ever filmed. The opening scene in the Chinese tea house has to be seen to be believed and I won't even mention the finale. Just know that it defies description. Watch this film soon, might become a new favorite. And you will most likely develop a man crush on Chow Yun Fat.

    John Woo is of course a legend for the Hong Kong film industry and one of the great action directors because of his heroic bloodshed genre he created. Hard Boiled is considered one of his best and it is certainly a very entertaining film just for its action scenes. Officer "Tequlia" Yuen (Chow Yun-Fat) is a Hong Kong police detective whom partner gets killed in a restaurant shoot out and he sets out to get the Triad leader that was responsible, Johnny Wong (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang). But when his boss Superintendent Pang (Philip Chan) orders Tequlia to stop his investigation, so he goes on a one man war against the Triads. Johnny has also recruited a top assassin and enforcer, Tony (Tony Leung). But it turns out he has his own secret and Tequlia and Tony ends up working to together bring down Johnny. Hard Boiled is around three major action set pieces, each getting bigger then the previous one. They were inventive and bloody. The restaurant had a tense had a tense build up with the boiling kettles, the police on there stake out and it became a big shoot out in a tight location and many innocent people get killed. It was almost like a Bruce Lee film, particularly with the score. The warehouse was just fun seeing men riding around on motorbikes, shooting people and also shows how one man could take on a small army. And the hospital set piece is just a massive pitch battle between the police and Triads, it was almost epic in scale because of the amounts of explosions, blood and bullets flying about. Whilst Woo does overuse slow motion and bullet sparks sometimes he does know how to craft an action scene, knowing where to focus, how to edit so you could follow what happens. I particularly like the long tracking shots in the hospital as all the action and carnage goes on all round, focusing on our two heroes. It is also very refreshing to see a film that does not need CGI, a film that actually uses stunt work and real special effects and it was shot very much like other action films from the 80s and 90s using a rather dark filter to it and most of the action takes place at night. Woo knows how to move the camera and does bring to live his own sense of hyper-realism. Hong Kong detectives seem to be very trigger happy. The plot itself is simply but Woo does not treat the audience like idiots. It is simply a tough cop going by his own rules and sets out to bring down a Triad boss any way possible. Chow Yun-Fat plays the role very well and his character is shown to be tough, ruthless cop who does have guilt about the lost of partner. He is also shown to have good with Teresa Mo as they sing pop songs together as they decode a message from a undercover police officer. The whole undercover police officer subplot who has to do violence acts reminded me of Infernal Affairs but it possibly because that film was also set in Hong Kong. Hard Boiled does suffers from some cop film clich&eacute;s, particularly the police chief telling his rouge officer but this is a very well made, entertaining action film. This is a film that has a lot of John Woo's traits like slow-mo, reflections, gun-fu especially using two guns at once and playing soft music over a bloody action scene (a trick he used in Face/Off).

    I was pretty impressed by John Woo's Face Off, which was a very entertaining action film with a nice cast so I was curious to check out his early work. The action sequences are handled very well in The Killer, but at the same time I felt they were were a bit uninspired. There are plenty of shootout moments here, but I found them quite repetitive and not necessarily entertaining. Also, I had problems with the editing, which was awkward at times. As for the acting, the leads do an okay job but didn't seem so convincing in the more dramatic scenes for me. Overall, The Killer was a bit disappointing experience but an enjoyable mess nevertheless.

    Once I showed this film to a friend I asked him what he thought of it, and he said: "10 out of 10 for what it was/is." I did not like that remark cause you rate every movie for what it is and not only action shoot em up bullet feasts. In action movies you are to find action in some bad story with uninteresting characters. In Hard boiled you are to find great drama such as friendship and honor within the action so instead of action in story we get story in action and having the leads being played by the two greatest HK actors around doesn't harm non to much either. You could actually make a top 5 greatest shoot out scenes of all time and get away using only scenes from Hard boiled, they are all that good. The most technically challenging and most impressive set piece in the film must be the 2minutes and 40seconds long tracking shot that they had to re-shoot just about six times before they could move on. This is a great, great, great film and should be treated with all the amount of respect as let say, a film like the godfather would get. Cause remember film snobs does not love films but instead they love films that are quote, unquote: "serious." I, myself took this film seriously and look what I got out of it. A must see. 10/10 Masterpiece.

    I watched this and this was one of the greatest action movies ever and it starred Chow Yun Fat who is awesome as Inspector 'Tequila' Yuen a gun-fighting cop with pretty reflexes to match his gun skills and attitude! This was a great action cop movie! The action scenes are nothing short of thrilling which is what I expect of John Woo films and the story was pretty decent. Also Chow Yun Fat has other actors backing him up not just the interesting villains of this movie but also Tequila's colleagues who are shown including his boss Superintendent Pang! This is among my personal top 20 of greatest ever action movies! This is a true action classic!

    If a work of art takes it over the top, so to speak, and suddenly that strata becomes the new norm, "authenticity" can become a murky issue. Is Hard Boiled just another brainless action movie, or is it THE brainless action movie, something that should have stood alone as the final statement of that sort of thing? A lot of conventions are introduced here: the role of the police officer is distilled into "the good guy with a gun", sort of a modern lone ranger. Even in Dirty Harry, there were hints that Callahan might have occasionally made arrests and done various "policey" things from time to time--but not here, oh no. It's all just metaphor, a gloriously black and white blood opera that hooks you on a sense of righteousness you'd balk at in a more sensible state of mind. In many ways it's more a continuation of martial arts and chivalrous swordplay movies than anything crime related. Think about it--teahouse battles, people shooting (stabbing) through themselves to hit someone holding them, etc... all Shaw Bros and Golden Harvest stuff. After hundreds of inferior copycats, Hard Boiled begs to be understood in terms of its initial cultural context. However, something about its execution is clearly authentic. The plot is a tad less purposeful than Woo's previous films, actually stitched together and made up out of thin air from various stages of shooting; it shows, but the spontaneity often works in its favor. Why does the bad guy have an impossible secret armoury beneath the hospital? Why not? Patients make good potential hostages. Woo logic. What was the likelihood of those doctors successfully resuscitating that little girl during a Mexican standoff in The Killer? Well, they did, and that's what matters. If you have to ask these questions, you're watching these movies for the wrong reasons. Woo's cloying, ultra-melodramatic, but somehow effective and charming sentimentalism is dialled down a bit, though still present. Typical themes of honor and conflicted loyalties inform the action, but this is more a movie about "moments" than anything: Chow Yun-fat sliding through a table of flour at the end of the birdcage teahouse shootout, appearing next to his victim like a ghost and exacting immediate revenge for a fallen comrade; several minute hallway shootouts without cuts; Tony Leung assassinating his target with a gun hidden in a Shakespeare anthology; Chow Yun-fat on his trail, matching books with the rectangular clean spot in the blood splatter, etc. There was always a certain physicality to Woo's otherwise flagrantly unrealistic "gun ballet" acts that imitators never quite captured. Weaponry has a sense of weight; explosions, ballistics and broken glass seem to pose an actual threat; even real babies (as manipulative of a metaphor as that might be) are thrown in harm's way. Basically, if it all seems a little stupid to you, that's because this is the first movie to really take it to this level, nitwit! Sadly, they'll never make them like this again, so you might as well realize Hollywood blockbusters are a waste of time, hire a hypnotist who can make you forget about Hard Boiled, and rewatch it 100 times. By the way, at least "heart-on-sleeve" implies that the sleeve in question isn't blocked by a limp wrist.

The action sequences are handled very well in The Killer, but at the same time I felt they were were a bit uninspired. There are plenty of shootout moments here, but I found them quite repetitive and not necessarily entertaining. Also, I had problems with the editing, which was awkward at times. As for the acting, the leads do an okay job but didn't seem so convincing in the more dramatic scenes for me. Overall, The Killer was a bit disappointing experience but an enjoyable mess nevertheless.

    Once I showed this film to a friend I asked him what he thought of it, and he said: "10 out of 10 for what it was/is." I did not like that remark cause you rate every movie for what it is and not only action shoot em up bullet feasts. In action movies you are to find action in some bad story with uninteresting characters. In Hard boiled you are to find great drama such as friendship and honor within the action so instead of action in story we get story in action and having the leads being played by the two greatest HK actors around doesn't harm non to much either. You could actually make a top 5 greatest shoot out scenes of all time and get away using only scenes from Hard boiled, they are all that good. The most technically challenging and most impressive set piece in the film must be the 2minutes and 40seconds long tracking shot that they had to re-shoot just about six times before they could move on. This is a great, great, great film and should be treated with all the amount of respect as let say, a film like the godfather would get. Cause remember film snobs does not love films but instead they love films that are quote, unquote: "serious." I, myself took this film seriously and look what I got out of it. A must see. 10/10 Masterpiece.

    I watched this and this was one of the greatest action movies ever and it starred Chow Yun Fat who is awesome as Inspector 'Tequila' Yuen a gun-fighting cop with pretty reflexes to match his gun skills and attitude! This was a great action cop movie! The action scenes are nothing short of thrilling which is what I expect of John Woo films and the story was pretty decent. Also Chow Yun Fat has other actors backing him up not just the interesting villains of this movie but also Tequila's colleagues who are shown including his boss Superintendent Pang! This is among my personal top 20 of greatest ever action movies! This is a true action classic!

    If a work of art takes it over the top, so to speak, and suddenly that strata becomes the new norm, "authenticity" can become a murky issue. Is Hard Boiled just another brainless action movie, or is it THE brainless action movie, something that should have stood alone as the final statement of that sort of thing? A lot of conventions are introduced here: the role of the police officer is distilled into "the good guy with a gun", sort of a modern lone ranger. Even in Dirty Harry, there were hints that Callahan might have occasionally made arrests and done various "policey" things from time to time--but not here, oh no. It's all just metaphor, a gloriously black and white blood opera that hooks you on a sense of righteousness you'd balk at in a more sensible state of mind. In many ways it's more a continuation of martial arts and chivalrous swordplay movies than anything crime related. Think about it--teahouse battles, people shooting (stabbing) through themselves to hit someone holding them, etc... all Shaw Bros and Golden Harvest stuff. After hundreds of inferior copycats, Hard Boiled begs to be understood in terms of its initial cultural context. However, something about its execution is clearly authentic. The plot is a tad less purposeful than Woo's previous films, actually stitched together and made up out of thin air from various stages of shooting; it shows, but the spontaneity often works in its favor. Why does the bad guy have an impossible secret armoury beneath the hospital? Why not? Patients make good potential hostages. Woo logic. What was the likelihood of those doctors successfully resuscitating that little girl during a Mexican standoff in The Killer? Well, they did, and that's what matters. If you have to ask these questions, you're watching these movies for the wrong reasons. Woo's cloying, ultra-melodramatic, but somehow effective and charming sentimentalism is dialled down a bit, though still present. Typical themes of honor and conflicted loyalties inform the action, but this is more a movie about "moments" than anything: Chow Yun-fat sliding through a table of flour at the end of the birdcage teahouse shootout, appearing next to his victim like a ghost and exacting immediate revenge for a fallen comrade; several minute hallway shootouts without cuts; Tony Leung assassinating his target with a gun hidden in a Shakespeare anthology; Chow Yun-fat on his trail, matching books with the rectangular clean spot in the blood splatter, etc. There was always a certain physicality to Woo's otherwise flagrantly unrealistic "gun ballet" acts that imitators never quite captured. Weaponry has a sense of weight; explosions, ballistics and broken glass seem to pose an actual threat; even real babies (as manipulative of a metaphor as that might be) are thrown in harm's way. Basically, if it all seems a little stupid to you, that's because this is the first movie to really take it to this level, nitwit! Sadly, they'll never make them like this again, so you might as well realize Hollywood blockbusters are a waste of time, hire a hypnotist who can make you forget about Hard Boiled, and rewatch it 100 times. By the way, at least "heart-on-sleeve" implies that the sleeve in question isn't blocked by a limp wrist.

    Some guy quoted on the back of the cover to this movie: "John Woo is God." Well, he's not God, and he's not even a god, he is just a human being like the rest of us, fallible. This movie though is extraordinary and leaves many Hollywood movies for dead. Even John Woo's Hollywood productions come no where near to this movie. Not only is it almost non-stop action, but the characters in this movie are real, breathing, and in some ways, very tragic. The tragic nature of Tony is something that one very rarely sees in a Hollywood movie, but is very relevant in Hong Kong. This movie is about a cop named Tequila (Chow-Yun-Fat) who is caught in a gun fight in a tea house when he attempts to stop an illegal gun deal going down. This fight is fast, furious, has a huge body-count, and stabs you in the heart as Tequila's partner is gunned down. This is no ordinary Hollywood gunfight, this is one with guts. One of the themes of this movie is loneliness. Tequilla is a major character but the movie deals more with Tony, an undercover cop who is trying to bust open a triad gang's gunrunning scheme. Tony is a lonely man whom nobody really knows. He has no identity and only one person knows his birthday and that is his commanding officer. Tony wanted to be a police officer but he never thought that he would be placed in such a situation. He has to kill for if he does not his cover will be blown, and with this killing he must also betray close friends. He is told by Mr Hoi not to trust Johnny Wong and it is Johnny Wong who he throws his lot in with in the end. Johnny Wong is also a very interesting character. He goes beyond being a bad guy to being outright sadistic. John Woo is known to make his characters all bad, Tequilla is one such character that even though he is a cop, he has a very nasty, annoying streak through him. The only truly honourable man in this movie is Tony. Johnny Wong though is far more evil than most bad guys that I have seen. This comes to the point of where you draw the line, and I think Woo is trying to help us think of where this line is, or if there is any. Wong goes to the point where his loyal henchmen begin to question his actions because he is doing things that not even they would do. Hard Boiled is seriously nothing short of brilliant. It has the longest gunfight that I have seen in any movie, and there isn't even a pause for breath. Unlike movies like the Killer and Face Off where there is a slow bit and then the action takes off, Hard Boiled just seems speed by yet giving enough time to develop the characters brilliantly. The only problem is that the subtitles suck.

    This movie is a hard-core action film by John Woo about a dirty harry type cop, tequila (Chow Yun-Fat) who's partner is killed in action during the exposition, and has a vendetta by taking down the Chinese mob with help from one of the mob's highest ranking assassins who is secretly a troubled undercover cop. The action scenes really blew my mind away, I mean completely. Especially the teahouse and the hospital scenes. It's gun-fu basically. This movie has a very high body count due to the lengthy action scenes. The hospital action scene actually lasts more than a half hour. This is not JUST your typical action movie. This movie truly is a epitome of bloodshed and glorification of violence. The action scenes are actually the main emphasis of the film because the action is pure art. The story is pretty generic and straightforward, but performances by the actors are actually very good because you sympathize with the characters and their problems in life. In general, this is one of the best action films ever made and deserves equal recognition with movies, such as face/off and die hard.

    Another crime drama from writer-director John Woo, Hard Boiled has the same formula, with lots of violent and bloody action. Back to the usual Hong Kong setting, as officer Yuen, and his partner, Benny, get into a shootout with a bunch of gun smugglers in which Benny is killed. Yuen wants revenge on the gangster who killed his coworker, but his commander removes him from the case. An undercover cop named Tony is working for a mobster, Hoi, who he turns against when seeking a better deal. A gang war unfolds and Yuen finds out that Tony is crooked. The climax occurs when Yuen tracks down a large cache of weapons to a hospital. Of course, Woo uses the long corridors of the hospital to his advantage, when the police and the bad guys get into an extended shootout. The result looks like a video game, with the camera following the cops up and down the hallways in an uber kill mode. Once again, Woo has created a top notch thriller with walk to wall adventures.

    Yes, John Woo is terrific director. At my opinion he was at his best in this mind blowing, kicked-ass action package. Everything that he has done before, and I mean particularly on A Better Tomorrow and The Killer reached its culmination in Hard Boiled. In fact, when John Woo completed this film, he went in U.S, later directed Hard Target, Face Off, which were a little bit disappointing compared to his Hong-Kong work. Yes, there is massive amount of shootouts, graphic violence, explosions doves(symbol of piece), gun play(Mexican stand-off). Everything in John Woo's style. But the shooting is amazingly choreographed. Strongly stylized. Lots of special effects, explosions, glass shattering. Looks and sounds so real. I never have seen it so in an action film. Bad things are choppy and ludicrous story, terrible dubbing and soundtrack as well the thing that irritated me most(but not enough to hate the movie). It is like a video game where some people get shot several times and then walk and shoot like nothing happened. Those guys(especially villains) sometimes looks so invulnerable. At the end, Hard Boiled is masterpiece for action films. Loud, exciting, amazing, but with few oversights. i strongly recommended the movie for all action fans if they had not see it, to see. And enjoy!

    There is really no need to discuss plot. Plot isn't a device that Woo uses particularly well and that is actually a positive attribute of a film like this. The story is serviceable enough but it isn't overly complicated to get in the way of the action. And let's not mince words, the action is the real star of this show. Chow Yun Fat oozes cool and he is given some incredible action set pieces to look cool on. I prefer A Better Tomorrow over this film but don't think that is anything more than subjective opinion - this is an amazing action film that most any fan of gun fights and explosions will enjoy to the fullest. You essentially get two hours of some of the greatest action sequences ever filmed. The opening scene in the Chinese tea house has to be seen to be believed and I won't even mention the finale. Just know that it defies description. Watch this film soon, might become a new favorite. And you will most likely develop a man crush on Chow Yun Fat.

    John Woo is of course a legend for the Hong Kong film industry and one of the great action directors because of his heroic bloodshed genre he created. Hard Boiled is considered one of his best and it is certainly a very entertaining film just for its action scenes. Officer "Tequlia" Yuen (Chow Yun-Fat) is a Hong Kong police detective whom partner gets killed in a restaurant shoot out and he sets out to get the Triad leader that was responsible, Johnny Wong (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang). But when his boss Superintendent Pang (Philip Chan) orders Tequlia to stop his investigation, so he goes on a one man war against the Triads. Johnny has also recruited a top assassin and enforcer, Tony (Tony Leung). But it turns out he has his own secret and Tequlia and Tony ends up working to together bring down Johnny. Hard Boiled is around three major action set pieces, each getting bigger then the previous one. They were inventive and bloody. The restaurant had a tense had a tense build up with the boiling kettles, the police on there stake out and it became a big shoot out in a tight location and many innocent people get killed. It was almost like a Bruce Lee film, particularly with the score. The warehouse was just fun seeing men riding around on motorbikes, shooting people and also shows how one man could take on a small army. And the hospital set piece is just a massive pitch battle between the police and Triads, it was almost epic in scale because of the amounts of explosions, blood and bullets flying about. Whilst Woo does overuse slow motion and bullet sparks sometimes he does know how to craft an action scene, knowing where to focus, how to edit so you could follow what happens. I particularly like the long tracking shots in the hospital as all the action and carnage goes on all round, focusing on our two heroes. It is also very refreshing to see a film that does not need CGI, a film that actually uses stunt work and real special effects and it was shot very much like other action films from the 80s and 90s using a rather dark filter to it and most of the action takes place at night. Woo knows how to move the camera and does bring to live his own sense of hyper-realism. Hong Kong detectives seem to be very trigger happy. The plot itself is simply but Woo does not treat the audience like idiots. It is simply a tough cop going by his own rules and sets out to bring down a Triad boss any way possible. Chow Yun-Fat plays the role very well and his character is shown to be tough, ruthless cop who does have guilt about the lost of partner. He is also shown to have good with Teresa Mo as they sing pop songs together as they decode a message from a undercover police officer. The whole undercover police officer subplot who has to do violence acts reminded me of Infernal Affairs but it possibly because that film was also set in Hong Kong. Hard Boiled does suffers from some cop film clich&eacute;s, particularly the police chief telling his rouge officer but this is a very well made, entertaining action film. This is a film that has a lot of John Woo's traits like slow-mo, reflections, gun-fu especially using two guns at once and playing soft music over a bloody action scene (a trick he used in Face/Off).

At the end, Hard Boiled is masterpiece for action films. Loud, exciting, amazing, but with few oversights. i strongly recommended the movie for all action fans if they had not see it, to see. And enjoy!

    There is really no need to discuss plot. Plot isn't a device that Woo uses particularly well and that is actually a positive attribute of a film like this. The story is serviceable enough but it isn't overly complicated to get in the way of the action. And let's not mince words, the action is the real star of this show. Chow Yun Fat oozes cool and he is given some incredible action set pieces to look cool on. I prefer A Better Tomorrow over this film but don't think that is anything more than subjective opinion - this is an amazing action film that most any fan of gun fights and explosions will enjoy to the fullest. You essentially get two hours of some of the greatest action sequences ever filmed. The opening scene in the Chinese tea house has to be seen to be believed and I won't even mention the finale. Just know that it defies description. Watch this film soon, might become a new favorite. And you will most likely develop a man crush on Chow Yun Fat.

    John Woo is of course a legend for the Hong Kong film industry and one of the great action directors because of his heroic bloodshed genre he created. Hard Boiled is considered one of his best and it is certainly a very entertaining film just for its action scenes. Officer "Tequlia" Yuen (Chow Yun-Fat) is a Hong Kong police detective whom partner gets killed in a restaurant shoot out and he sets out to get the Triad leader that was responsible, Johnny Wong (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang). But when his boss Superintendent Pang (Philip Chan) orders Tequlia to stop his investigation, so he goes on a one man war against the Triads. Johnny has also recruited a top assassin and enforcer, Tony (Tony Leung). But it turns out he has his own secret and Tequlia and Tony ends up working to together bring down Johnny. Hard Boiled is around three major action set pieces, each getting bigger then the previous one. They were inventive and bloody. The restaurant had a tense had a tense build up with the boiling kettles, the police on there stake out and it became a big shoot out in a tight location and many innocent people get killed. It was almost like a Bruce Lee film, particularly with the score. The warehouse was just fun seeing men riding around on motorbikes, shooting people and also shows how one man could take on a small army. And the hospital set piece is just a massive pitch battle between the police and Triads, it was almost epic in scale because of the amounts of explosions, blood and bullets flying about. Whilst Woo does overuse slow motion and bullet sparks sometimes he does know how to craft an action scene, knowing where to focus, how to edit so you could follow what happens. I particularly like the long tracking shots in the hospital as all the action and carnage goes on all round, focusing on our two heroes. It is also very refreshing to see a film that does not need CGI, a film that actually uses stunt work and real special effects and it was shot very much like other action films from the 80s and 90s using a rather dark filter to it and most of the action takes place at night. Woo knows how to move the camera and does bring to live his own sense of hyper-realism. Hong Kong detectives seem to be very trigger happy. The plot itself is simply but Woo does not treat the audience like idiots. It is simply a tough cop going by his own rules and sets out to bring down a Triad boss any way possible. Chow Yun-Fat plays the role very well and his character is shown to be tough, ruthless cop who does have guilt about the lost of partner. He is also shown to have good with Teresa Mo as they sing pop songs together as they decode a message from a undercover police officer. The whole undercover police officer subplot who has to do violence acts reminded me of Infernal Affairs but it possibly because that film was also set in Hong Kong. Hard Boiled does suffers from some cop film clich&eacute;s, particularly the police chief telling his rouge officer but this is a very well made, entertaining action film. This is a film that has a lot of John Woo's traits like slow-mo, reflections, gun-fu especially using two guns at once and playing soft music over a bloody action scene (a trick he used in Face/Off).

    I was pretty impressed by John Woo's Face Off, which was a very entertaining action film with a nice cast so I was curious to check out his early work. The action sequences are handled very well in The Killer, but at the same time I felt they were were a bit uninspired. There are plenty of shootout moments here, but I found them quite repetitive and not necessarily entertaining. Also, I had problems with the editing, which was awkward at times. As for the acting, the leads do an okay job but didn't seem so convincing in the more dramatic scenes for me. Overall, The Killer was a bit disappointing experience but an enjoyable mess nevertheless.

    Once I showed this film to a friend I asked him what he thought of it, and he said: "10 out of 10 for what it was/is." I did not like that remark cause you rate every movie for what it is and not only action shoot em up bullet feasts. In action movies you are to find action in some bad story with uninteresting characters. In Hard boiled you are to find great drama such as friendship and honor within the action so instead of action in story we get story in action and having the leads being played by the two greatest HK actors around doesn't harm non to much either. You could actually make a top 5 greatest shoot out scenes of all time and get away using only scenes from Hard boiled, they are all that good. The most technically challenging and most impressive set piece in the film must be the 2minutes and 40seconds long tracking shot that they had to re-shoot just about six times before they could move on. This is a great, great, great film and should be treated with all the amount of respect as let say, a film like the godfather would get. Cause remember film snobs does not love films but instead they love films that are quote, unquote: "serious." I, myself took this film seriously and look what I got out of it. A must see. 10/10 Masterpiece.

    I watched this and this was one of the greatest action movies ever and it starred Chow Yun Fat who is awesome as Inspector 'Tequila' Yuen a gun-fighting cop with pretty reflexes to match his gun skills and attitude! This was a great action cop movie! The action scenes are nothing short of thrilling which is what I expect of John Woo films and the story was pretty decent. Also Chow Yun Fat has other actors backing him up not just the interesting villains of this movie but also Tequila's colleagues who are shown including his boss Superintendent Pang! This is among my personal top 20 of greatest ever action movies! This is a true action classic!

    If a work of art takes it over the top, so to speak, and suddenly that strata becomes the new norm, "authenticity" can become a murky issue. Is Hard Boiled just another brainless action movie, or is it THE brainless action movie, something that should have stood alone as the final statement of that sort of thing? A lot of conventions are introduced here: the role of the police officer is distilled into "the good guy with a gun", sort of a modern lone ranger. Even in Dirty Harry, there were hints that Callahan might have occasionally made arrests and done various "policey" things from time to time--but not here, oh no. It's all just metaphor, a gloriously black and white blood opera that hooks you on a sense of righteousness you'd balk at in a more sensible state of mind. In many ways it's more a continuation of martial arts and chivalrous swordplay movies than anything crime related. Think about it--teahouse battles, people shooting (stabbing) through themselves to hit someone holding them, etc... all Shaw Bros and Golden Harvest stuff. After hundreds of inferior copycats, Hard Boiled begs to be understood in terms of its initial cultural context. However, something about its execution is clearly authentic. The plot is a tad less purposeful than Woo's previous films, actually stitched together and made up out of thin air from various stages of shooting; it shows, but the spontaneity often works in its favor. Why does the bad guy have an impossible secret armoury beneath the hospital? Why not? Patients make good potential hostages. Woo logic. What was the likelihood of those doctors successfully resuscitating that little girl during a Mexican standoff in The Killer? Well, they did, and that's what matters. If you have to ask these questions, you're watching these movies for the wrong reasons. Woo's cloying, ultra-melodramatic, but somehow effective and charming sentimentalism is dialled down a bit, though still present. Typical themes of honor and conflicted loyalties inform the action, but this is more a movie about "moments" than anything: Chow Yun-fat sliding through a table of flour at the end of the birdcage teahouse shootout, appearing next to his victim like a ghost and exacting immediate revenge for a fallen comrade; several minute hallway shootouts without cuts; Tony Leung assassinating his target with a gun hidden in a Shakespeare anthology; Chow Yun-fat on his trail, matching books with the rectangular clean spot in the blood splatter, etc. There was always a certain physicality to Woo's otherwise flagrantly unrealistic "gun ballet" acts that imitators never quite captured. Weaponry has a sense of weight; explosions, ballistics and broken glass seem to pose an actual threat; even real babies (as manipulative of a metaphor as that might be) are thrown in harm's way. Basically, if it all seems a little stupid to you, that's because this is the first movie to really take it to this level, nitwit! Sadly, they'll never make them like this again, so you might as well realize Hollywood blockbusters are a waste of time, hire a hypnotist who can make you forget about Hard Boiled, and rewatch it 100 times. By the way, at least "heart-on-sleeve" implies that the sleeve in question isn't blocked by a limp wrist.

    Some guy quoted on the back of the cover to this movie: "John Woo is God." Well, he's not God, and he's not even a god, he is just a human being like the rest of us, fallible. This movie though is extraordinary and leaves many Hollywood movies for dead. Even John Woo's Hollywood productions come no where near to this movie. Not only is it almost non-stop action, but the characters in this movie are real, breathing, and in some ways, very tragic. The tragic nature of Tony is something that one very rarely sees in a Hollywood movie, but is very relevant in Hong Kong. This movie is about a cop named Tequila (Chow-Yun-Fat) who is caught in a gun fight in a tea house when he attempts to stop an illegal gun deal going down. This fight is fast, furious, has a huge body-count, and stabs you in the heart as Tequila's partner is gunned down. This is no ordinary Hollywood gunfight, this is one with guts. One of the themes of this movie is loneliness. Tequilla is a major character but the movie deals more with Tony, an undercover cop who is trying to bust open a triad gang's gunrunning scheme. Tony is a lonely man whom nobody really knows. He has no identity and only one person knows his birthday and that is his commanding officer. Tony wanted to be a police officer but he never thought that he would be placed in such a situation. He has to kill for if he does not his cover will be blown, and with this killing he must also betray close friends. He is told by Mr Hoi not to trust Johnny Wong and it is Johnny Wong who he throws his lot in with in the end. Johnny Wong is also a very interesting character. He goes beyond being a bad guy to being outright sadistic. John Woo is known to make his characters all bad, Tequilla is one such character that even though he is a cop, he has a very nasty, annoying streak through him. The only truly honourable man in this movie is Tony. Johnny Wong though is far more evil than most bad guys that I have seen. This comes to the point of where you draw the line, and I think Woo is trying to help us think of where this line is, or if there is any. Wong goes to the point where his loyal henchmen begin to question his actions because he is doing things that not even they would do. Hard Boiled is seriously nothing short of brilliant. It has the longest gunfight that I have seen in any movie, and there isn't even a pause for breath. Unlike movies like the Killer and Face Off where there is a slow bit and then the action takes off, Hard Boiled just seems speed by yet giving enough time to develop the characters brilliantly. The only problem is that the subtitles suck.

    This movie is a hard-core action film by John Woo about a dirty harry type cop, tequila (Chow Yun-Fat) who's partner is killed in action during the exposition, and has a vendetta by taking down the Chinese mob with help from one of the mob's highest ranking assassins who is secretly a troubled undercover cop. The action scenes really blew my mind away, I mean completely. Especially the teahouse and the hospital scenes. It's gun-fu basically. This movie has a very high body count due to the lengthy action scenes. The hospital action scene actually lasts more than a half hour. This is not JUST your typical action movie. This movie truly is a epitome of bloodshed and glorification of violence. The action scenes are actually the main emphasis of the film because the action is pure art. The story is pretty generic and straightforward, but performances by the actors are actually very good because you sympathize with the characters and their problems in life. In general, this is one of the best action films ever made and deserves equal recognition with movies, such as face/off and die hard.

    Another crime drama from writer-director John Woo, Hard Boiled has the same formula, with lots of violent and bloody action. Back to the usual Hong Kong setting, as officer Yuen, and his partner, Benny, get into a shootout with a bunch of gun smugglers in which Benny is killed. Yuen wants revenge on the gangster who killed his coworker, but his commander removes him from the case. An undercover cop named Tony is working for a mobster, Hoi, who he turns against when seeking a better deal. A gang war unfolds and Yuen finds out that Tony is crooked. The climax occurs when Yuen tracks down a large cache of weapons to a hospital. Of course, Woo uses the long corridors of the hospital to his advantage, when the police and the bad guys get into an extended shootout. The result looks like a video game, with the camera following the cops up and down the hallways in an uber kill mode. Once again, Woo has created a top notch thriller with walk to wall adventures.

    Yes, John Woo is terrific director. At my opinion he was at his best in this mind blowing, kicked-ass action package. Everything that he has done before, and I mean particularly on A Better Tomorrow and The Killer reached its culmination in Hard Boiled. In fact, when John Woo completed this film, he went in U.S, later directed Hard Target, Face Off, which were a little bit disappointing compared to his Hong-Kong work. Yes, there is massive amount of shootouts, graphic violence, explosions doves(symbol of piece), gun play(Mexican stand-off). Everything in John Woo's style. But the shooting is amazingly choreographed. Strongly stylized. Lots of special effects, explosions, glass shattering. Looks and sounds so real. I never have seen it so in an action film. Bad things are choppy and ludicrous story, terrible dubbing and soundtrack as well the thing that irritated me most(but not enough to hate the movie). It is like a video game where some people get shot several times and then walk and shoot like nothing happened. Those guys(especially villains) sometimes looks so invulnerable. At the end, Hard Boiled is masterpiece for action films. Loud, exciting, amazing, but with few oversights. i strongly recommended the movie for all action fans if they had not see it, to see.

Tony wanted to be a police officer but he never thought that he would be placed in such a situation. He has to kill for if he does not his cover will be blown, and with this killing he must also betray close friends. He is told by Mr Hoi not to trust Johnny Wong and it is Johnny Wong who he throws his lot in with in the end. Johnny Wong is also a very interesting character. He goes beyond being a bad guy to being outright sadistic. John Woo is known to make his characters all bad, Tequilla is one such character that even though he is a cop, he has a very nasty, annoying streak through him. The only truly honourable man in this movie is Tony. Johnny Wong though is far more evil than most bad guys that I have seen. This comes to the point of where you draw the line, and I think Woo is trying to help us think of where this line is, or if there is any. Wong goes to the point where his loyal henchmen begin to question his actions because he is doing things that not even they would do. Hard Boiled is seriously nothing short of brilliant. It has the longest gunfight that I have seen in any movie, and there isn't even a pause for breath. Unlike movies like the Killer and Face Off where there is a slow bit and then the action takes off, Hard Boiled just seems speed by yet giving enough time to develop the characters brilliantly. The only problem is that the subtitles suck.

    This movie is a hard-core action film by John Woo about a dirty harry type cop, tequila (Chow Yun-Fat) who's partner is killed in action during the exposition, and has a vendetta by taking down the Chinese mob with help from one of the mob's highest ranking assassins who is secretly a troubled undercover cop. The action scenes really blew my mind away, I mean completely. Especially the teahouse and the hospital scenes. It's gun-fu basically. This movie has a very high body count due to the lengthy action scenes. The hospital action scene actually lasts more than a half hour. This is not JUST your typical action movie. This movie truly is a epitome of bloodshed and glorification of violence. The action scenes are actually the main emphasis of the film because the action is pure art. The story is pretty generic and straightforward, but performances by the actors are actually very good because you sympathize with the characters and their problems in life. In general, this is one of the best action films ever made and deserves equal recognition with movies, such as face/off and die hard.

    Another crime drama from writer-director John Woo, Hard Boiled has the same formula, with lots of violent and bloody action. Back to the usual Hong Kong setting, as officer Yuen, and his partner, Benny, get into a shootout with a bunch of gun smugglers in which Benny is killed. Yuen wants revenge on the gangster who killed his coworker, but his commander removes him from the case. An undercover cop named Tony is working for a mobster, Hoi, who he turns against when seeking a better deal. A gang war unfolds and Yuen finds out that Tony is crooked. The climax occurs when Yuen tracks down a large cache of weapons to a hospital. Of course, Woo uses the long corridors of the hospital to his advantage, when the police and the bad guys get into an extended shootout. The result looks like a video game, with the camera following the cops up and down the hallways in an uber kill mode. Once again, Woo has created a top notch thriller with walk to wall adventures.

    Yes, John Woo is terrific director. At my opinion he was at his best in this mind blowing, kicked-ass action package. Everything that he has done before, and I mean particularly on A Better Tomorrow and The Killer reached its culmination in Hard Boiled. In fact, when John Woo completed this film, he went in U.S, later directed Hard Target, Face Off, which were a little bit disappointing compared to his Hong-Kong work. Yes, there is massive amount of shootouts, graphic violence, explosions doves(symbol of piece), gun play(Mexican stand-off). Everything in John Woo's style. But the shooting is amazingly choreographed. Strongly stylized. Lots of special effects, explosions, glass shattering. Looks and sounds so real. I never have seen it so in an action film. Bad things are choppy and ludicrous story, terrible dubbing and soundtrack as well the thing that irritated me most(but not enough to hate the movie). It is like a video game where some people get shot several times and then walk and shoot like nothing happened. Those guys(especially villains) sometimes looks so invulnerable. At the end, Hard Boiled is masterpiece for action films. Loud, exciting, amazing, but with few oversights. i strongly recommended the movie for all action fans if they had not see it, to see. And enjoy!

    There is really no need to discuss plot. Plot isn't a device that Woo uses particularly well and that is actually a positive attribute of a film like this. The story is serviceable enough but it isn't overly complicated to get in the way of the action. And let's not mince words, the action is the real star of this show. Chow Yun Fat oozes cool and he is given some incredible action set pieces to look cool on. I prefer A Better Tomorrow over this film but don't think that is anything more than subjective opinion - this is an amazing action film that most any fan of gun fights and explosions will enjoy to the fullest. You essentially get two hours of some of the greatest action sequences ever filmed. The opening scene in the Chinese tea house has to be seen to be believed and I won't even mention the finale. Just know that it defies description. Watch this film soon, might become a new favorite. And you will most likely develop a man crush on Chow Yun Fat.

    John Woo is of course a legend for the Hong Kong film industry and one of the great action directors because of his heroic bloodshed genre he created. Hard Boiled is considered one of his best and it is certainly a very entertaining film just for its action scenes. Officer "Tequlia" Yuen (Chow Yun-Fat) is a Hong Kong police detective whom partner gets killed in a restaurant shoot out and he sets out to get the Triad leader that was responsible, Johnny Wong (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang). But when his boss Superintendent Pang (Philip Chan) orders Tequlia to stop his investigation, so he goes on a one man war against the Triads. Johnny has also recruited a top assassin and enforcer, Tony (Tony Leung). But it turns out he has his own secret and Tequlia and Tony ends up working to together bring down Johnny. Hard Boiled is around three major action set pieces, each getting bigger then the previous one. They were inventive and bloody. The restaurant had a tense had a tense build up with the boiling kettles, the police on there stake out and it became a big shoot out in a tight location and many innocent people get killed. It was almost like a Bruce Lee film, particularly with the score. The warehouse was just fun seeing men riding around on motorbikes, shooting people and also shows how one man could take on a small army. And the hospital set piece is just a massive pitch battle between the police and Triads, it was almost epic in scale because of the amounts of explosions, blood and bullets flying about. Whilst Woo does overuse slow motion and bullet sparks sometimes he does know how to craft an action scene, knowing where to focus, how to edit so you could follow what happens. I particularly like the long tracking shots in the hospital as all the action and carnage goes on all round, focusing on our two heroes. It is also very refreshing to see a film that does not need CGI, a film that actually uses stunt work and real special effects and it was shot very much like other action films from the 80s and 90s using a rather dark filter to it and most of the action takes place at night. Woo knows how to move the camera and does bring to live his own sense of hyper-realism. Hong Kong detectives seem to be very trigger happy. The plot itself is simply but Woo does not treat the audience like idiots. It is simply a tough cop going by his own rules and sets out to bring down a Triad boss any way possible. Chow Yun-Fat plays the role very well and his character is shown to be tough, ruthless cop who does have guilt about the lost of partner. He is also shown to have good with Teresa Mo as they sing pop songs together as they decode a message from a undercover police officer. The whole undercover police officer subplot who has to do violence acts reminded me of Infernal Affairs but it possibly because that film was also set in Hong Kong. Hard Boiled does suffers from some cop film clich&eacute;s, particularly the police chief telling his rouge officer but this is a very well made, entertaining action film. This is a film that has a lot of John Woo's traits like slow-mo, reflections, gun-fu especially using two guns at once and playing soft music over a bloody action scene (a trick he used in Face/Off).

    I was pretty impressed by John Woo's Face Off, which was a very entertaining action film with a nice cast so I was curious to check out his early work. The action sequences are handled very well in The Killer, but at the same time I felt they were were a bit uninspired. There are plenty of shootout moments here, but I found them quite repetitive and not necessarily entertaining. Also, I had problems with the editing, which was awkward at times. As for the acting, the leads do an okay job but didn't seem so convincing in the more dramatic scenes for me. Overall, The Killer was a bit disappointing experience but an enjoyable mess nevertheless.

    Once I showed this film to a friend I asked him what he thought of it, and he said: "10 out of 10 for what it was/is." I did not like that remark cause you rate every movie for what it is and not only action shoot em up bullet feasts. In action movies you are to find action in some bad story with uninteresting characters. In Hard boiled you are to find great drama such as friendship and honor within the action so instead of action in story we get story in action and having the leads being played by the two greatest HK actors around doesn't harm non to much either. You could actually make a top 5 greatest shoot out scenes of all time and get away using only scenes from Hard boiled, they are all that good. The most technically challenging and most impressive set piece in the film must be the 2minutes and 40seconds long tracking shot that they had to re-shoot just about six times before they could move on. This is a great, great, great film and should be treated with all the amount of respect as let say, a film like the godfather would get. Cause remember film snobs does not love films but instead they love films that are quote, unquote: "serious." I, myself took this film seriously and look what I got out of it. A must see. 10/10 Masterpiece.

    I watched this and this was one of the greatest action movies ever and it starred Chow Yun Fat who is awesome as Inspector 'Tequila' Yuen a gun-fighting cop with pretty reflexes to match his gun skills and attitude! This was a great action cop movie! The action scenes are nothing short of thrilling which is what I expect of John Woo films and the story was pretty decent. Also Chow Yun Fat has other actors backing him up not just the interesting villains of this movie but also Tequila's colleagues who are shown including his boss Superintendent Pang! This is among my personal top 20 of greatest ever action movies! This is a true action classic!

    If a work of art takes it over the top, so to speak, and suddenly that strata becomes the new norm, "authenticity" can become a murky issue. Is Hard Boiled just another brainless action movie, or is it THE brainless action movie, something that should have stood alone as the final statement of that sort of thing? A lot of conventions are introduced here: the role of the police officer is distilled into "the good guy with a gun", sort of a modern lone ranger. Even in Dirty Harry, there were hints that Callahan might have occasionally made arrests and done various "policey" things from time to time--but not here, oh no. It's all just metaphor, a gloriously black and white blood opera that hooks you on a sense of righteousness you'd balk at in a more sensible state of mind. In many ways it's more a continuation of martial arts and chivalrous swordplay movies than anything crime related. Think about it--teahouse battles, people shooting (stabbing) through themselves to hit someone holding them, etc... all Shaw Bros and Golden Harvest stuff. After hundreds of inferior copycats, Hard Boiled begs to be understood in terms of its initial cultural context. However, something about its execution is clearly authentic. The plot is a tad less purposeful than Woo's previous films, actually stitched together and made up out of thin air from various stages of shooting; it shows, but the spontaneity often works in its favor. Why does the bad guy have an impossible secret armoury beneath the hospital? Why not? Patients make good potential hostages. Woo logic. What was the likelihood of those doctors successfully resuscitating that little girl during a Mexican standoff in The Killer? Well, they did, and that's what matters. If you have to ask these questions, you're watching these movies for the wrong reasons. Woo's cloying, ultra-melodramatic, but somehow effective and charming sentimentalism is dialled down a bit, though still present. Typical themes of honor and conflicted loyalties inform the action, but this is more a movie about "moments" than anything: Chow Yun-fat sliding through a table of flour at the end of the birdcage teahouse shootout, appearing next to his victim like a ghost and exacting immediate revenge for a fallen comrade; several minute hallway shootouts without cuts; Tony Leung assassinating his target with a gun hidden in a Shakespeare anthology; Chow Yun-fat on his trail, matching books with the rectangular clean spot in the blood splatter, etc. There was always a certain physicality to Woo's otherwise flagrantly unrealistic "gun ballet" acts that imitators never quite captured. Weaponry has a sense of weight; explosions, ballistics and broken glass seem to pose an actual threat; even real babies (as manipulative of a metaphor as that might be) are thrown in harm's way. Basically, if it all seems a little stupid to you, that's because this is the first movie to really take it to this level, nitwit! Sadly, they'll never make them like this again, so you might as well realize Hollywood blockbusters are a waste of time, hire a hypnotist who can make you forget about Hard Boiled, and rewatch it 100 times. By the way, at least "heart-on-sleeve" implies that the sleeve in question isn't blocked by a limp wrist.

    Some guy quoted on the back of the cover to this movie: "John Woo is God." Well, he's not God, and he's not even a god, he is just a human being like the rest of us, fallible. This movie though is extraordinary and leaves many Hollywood movies for dead. Even John Woo's Hollywood productions come no where near to this movie. Not only is it almost non-stop action, but the characters in this movie are real, breathing, and in some ways, very tragic. The tragic nature of Tony is something that one very rarely sees in a Hollywood movie, but is very relevant in Hong Kong. This movie is about a cop named Tequila (Chow-Yun-Fat) who is caught in a gun fight in a tea house when he attempts to stop an illegal gun deal going down. This fight is fast, furious, has a huge body-count, and stabs you in the heart as Tequila's partner is gunned down. This is no ordinary Hollywood gunfight, this is one with guts. One of the themes of this movie is loneliness. Tequilla is a major character but the movie deals more with Tony, an undercover cop who is trying to bust open a triad gang's gunrunning scheme. Tony is a lonely man whom nobody really knows. He has no identity and only one person knows his birthday and that is his commanding officer. Tony wanted to be a police officer but he never thought that he would be placed in such a situation. He has to kill for if he does not his cover will be blown, and with this killing he must also betray close friends. He is told by Mr Hoi not to trust Johnny Wong and it is Johnny Wong who he throws his lot in with in the end. Johnny Wong is also a very interesting character. He goes beyond being a bad guy to being outright sadistic. John Woo is known to make his characters all bad, Tequilla is one such character that even though he is a cop, he has a very nasty, annoying streak through him. The only truly honourable man in this movie is Tony. Johnny Wong though is far more evil than most bad guys that I have seen. This comes to the point of where you draw the line, and I think Woo is trying to help us think of where this line is, or if there is any. Wong goes to the point where his loyal henchmen begin to question his actions because he is doing things that not even they would do. Hard Boiled is seriously nothing short of brilliant. It has the longest gunfight that I have seen in any movie, and there isn't even a pause for breath. Unlike movies like the Killer and Face Off where there is a slow bit and then the action takes off, Hard Boiled just seems speed by yet giving enough time to develop the characters brilliantly. The only problem is that the subtitles suck.
