    Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (both looking winded) find themselves on the run, eventually hiding out on a cruise-ship under the guise of dance escorts for ballroom broads. Perhaps a decade ago, this may have been a great opportunity for the two leads to mine big laughs from a highly-contrived scenario, but here they're just too old to make the material sail. Matthau, in particular, doesn't seem as mobile, and Lemmon has to work overtime to make up for the obvious lethargy (not successful for a comedy). Dyan Cannon (doing an Ann-Margret) is sprightly, and familiar TV faces--plus a tap-dancing Donald O'Connor!--show up in small roles, however it is Brent Spiner as a wormy entertainment coordinator who steals the show. ** from ****

    A bit of the plot from Moon Over Miami and even more from The Monte Carlo Story has Walter Matthau as a degenerate footloose gambler getting a bit long in the tooth persuading an equally aged, but more square Jack Lemmon to take a cruise and try and fleece the old ladies in Out To Sea. Matthau needs Lemmon because Lemmon can cut it on a dance floor and he's signed them on as dancers for the unescorted women on the cruise. Of course Lemmon doesn't know that. What he does know that Matthau who is the brother of his late wife has come to him with one scheme after another for years. And Matthau owes some big money to the bookies and that's why he needs cash. So they go on the cruise and as for Matthau he gets involved with Dyan Cannon and her mother Elaine Stritch and its poker not the dance floor where he meets them. Matthau has to deal with a pompous Englishman in Edward Mulhare who really is a sitting target for Matthau's cons. As for Lemmon he gets involved with Gloria DeHaven who is accompanying her daughter and husband on a holiday. They don't think she gets out enough. Oddly enough that's how Matthau feels about Lemmon. As for the rest of the cast, Star Trek's Data Brent Spiner has a great part as an obnoxious twit of a performer and dancer who lords it over the others of greater talent who also include Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor. Matthau bounces some great lines off him and Spiner's reactions are priceless. I'd also have to single out Elaine Stritch who comes into her own explaining the facts of life to Cannon. During the Nineties we were fortunate indeed to have Lemmon and Matthau in some great films, specifically written for them. In Out To Sea you can see that a great supporting cast was assembled for them. Like some of the comedy teams, these two comic actors did variations on their first film together The Fortune Cookie where Matthau is the con artist who is always dragging Lemmon into one of his schemes. Out To Sea isn't as good as The Fortune Cookie or the first The Odd Couple, but it's still plenty funny.

    Once in a blue moon, along comes a film that is genuinely "sweet." This is one of those rare gems. Expertly directed by Martha Coolidge. What a fun ride this must have been for all concerned. There are legendary performers having a great time on screen and sadly most are now gone. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon have an on-screen give-and-take that is delicious and funny to watch (and Lemmon has a poignant and wistful scene as well.) Dyan Cannon(with a delightful giggle and a contagious laugh) and Gloria DeHaven are the romantic counterparts to Lemmon and Matthau and it's terrific to watch Edward Mulhare, the great Elaine Stritch, Rue McClanahan, Hal Linden, and wow ---there's Donald O'Connor showing he's still got it(wish his role was bigger.) Finally, although it would seem impossible to steal the movie from such greats Brent Spiner virtually pulls it off as the arrogant singing cruise director. (He should star in a TV sitcom. not too late!) His timing is superb. Along with established ballroom dancer, Andre Fortin, the dancing sequences would make "Dancing With the Stars" fans applaud with joy. Don't miss the added dancing sequence during the end credits with all of the stars and some funny outtakes. "Out to Sea" makes you want to finally book that seven day cruiseif only you could bump into these wonderful characters before you head back home.

    This movie didn't really make me laugh a lot. It gave me a few chuckles here and there. It felt more like a drama than a comedy. It was such a relief to see Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau performing together. They were funny here and there. The plot revolves around two men named Herb and Charlie (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthaue). Charlie might have found the woman of his dreams. He convinces his friends Herb to board a luxury cruise ship with him to pose as dancers for the ship while trying to get the woman of his dreams. Soon, Herb finds a woman he is in love with and poses as a doctor to win her over. The director on the luxury cruise gets suspicious of Charlie because he notices that he can't dance. Now, Herb and Charlie must make sure they don't blow their cover otherwise they'll be thrown overboard and owe over $5,000 instead of getting the free ride they were offered. The movie wasn't good. It wasn't bad either. Still, you should check it out. I give this movie 5 stars out of 10. It was alright!

    This is the kind of movie that people of a certain age will say of "I didn't think they made movies like that anymore". Walter Matthau gives his usual over-the-top performance, but instead of leaving teeth marks all over the scenery, leaves endearing grease stains. He is like that great uncle we all know that still wears plaid polyester and embarrasses everyone, but we still love anyway. Jack Lemmon's performance reminds us why he had more Golden Globe nominations than anyone else (22). He gives a true-to-life performance of the basically 'good, ordinary man', even in the milieu of a farce. This film will probably not appeal to people who prefer blunt humor designed to confront or offend, but will appeal to people who appreciate broad farce played with a straight face. The entire supporting cast is excellent in their ability to play such absurd characters while maintaining the reality of each character. Brent Spiner gives a marvelous performance as a professional version of a lounge lizard. Anyone who has known professional hosts in real life will immediately recognize the type he is playing. He nails the type perfectly. His rendition of 'slime' merits study as a perfect example of the contrast between absurd and pathetic. The plot is rather a straight-forward 'let's marry rich' theme that has the usual results. Just because a plot theme has been done a thousand times does not mean that it is dated, but rather that it is a timeless theme. The rest of the supporting cast shows what can happen when professionals exhibit their skills in the roles that are written for them, instead of vying for the spotlight. In this film even the second tier actors shine. It is also obvious that they enjoyed making this film. The plot may be standard and thin, but it allows the performers to shine. This film is a true treat for people who want to see professional actors engaging in their craft. The plot falls away and the performers shine.

    with two old friends. I've always enjoyed both Lemmon's and Mathaeu's films, and of course their team efforts are always worth watching, and often hilarious. Although I didn't personally regard this film as in the hilarious category, it is certainly a competent and entertaining vehicle for fans of the two principle actors and of 60s style romantic comedy plots. Brent Spiner may actually steal the show in terms of laughs as the arrogant and tyrannical Cruise Director. Gloria DeHaven proves that senior ladies can remain enormously attractive.

    Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, both of whom are sadly missed, proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their craft of bringing hilarious moments to the screen. This film is just another example of this. This time out they play two brothers-in-law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board. Of course, their boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named Gil Godwin who just enjoys harassing these boys. It's hilarious how Lemmon gives a quick lesson in dancing to Matthau and how the latter dances a riotous rumba with the boat's owner Rue McLanahan. Too bad that fellow dance instructors Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor are given so little to do but their parts call for that. Matthau falls for Dyan Cannon, on board with her fellow gold-digging mother, the usual outrageous Elaine Stritch. Unknown to them, Matthau has no money either. The widower Lemmon falls for Gloria De Haven, looking lovelier than ever. The film belongs to Matthau and Lemmon and will serve as a further tribute to their illustrious careers.

    I was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when I first saw it I was only mildly amused! I must say however, that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor wasn't given a bigger and better role! He was an enormous talent. There is a great chemistry among all the main cast members and Matthau has never been funnier. I am tremendously glad that this picture got made because we get to see Lemmon and Matthau team up for the very last time; in a vehicle that puts their talent to great use. Brent Spiner proves that "Data" from Star Trek the Next Geeration is not the only good character he can play. The storyline is really quite simple but the comedy and the characters work really well and I laughed heartily throughout this movie and I highly recommend it.

    "Out to Sea" was a vehicle for Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, a team of comedy actors that excelled in their different movies. This film seems to have been made after the success of "Grumpy Old Men", and it involves a cruise where the men will be involved in funny situations since they have been hired as male escorts to entertain the single women of a certain age that are attracted to this type of vacation. Martha Coolidge, the director, doesn't bring anything new to the picture. It's a formula movie, and as such, we know where it's going at all times. The best thing in the film is Brent Spinner, who is the cruise entertainment director, the man in charge of Herb and Charlie. This man, who loves to sing, supervises his domain with an iron fist and gets funny results. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau could do their Herb and Charlie well, as they proved in the many films they appeared together. Both actors have some good moments in the film. Dyan Cannon, Elaine Strich, and the lovely Gloria DeHaven, are good to see in any movie. Others in the cast include Rue McClanahan, Donnald O'Connor, Hal Linden, among others. Let's remember Mr. Lemmon and Mr. Matthau for other, better made movies than this one.

    Noticeably, if I review a comedy, I noticed that I lower my standard automatically in order to watch it. This could mean one of two things. Either: 1)I don't like to laugh.... Or: 2)the movie just isn't funny. It would have to be the second, because I do appreciate decent comedy. This is just not in that category. While it is not the worst, it is, as suggested, another "Grumpy Old Men" scenario. The scenes are at times a bit too embarrassing. Matthau, while funny, just too hard to believe as a card shark, even for a laugh. Dyan Cannon looks amazing for her age (Is she really 75?); there are several gratuitous bikini scenes to compliment her plastic surgeon. One great appearance by Elaine Stritch, always managing to be sarcastic and funny, even with minimal screen time. All in all, not the worst, you may get a few laughs. 5/10.

    Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (both looking winded) find themselves on the run, eventually hiding out on a cruise-ship under the guise of dance escorts for ballroom broads. Perhaps a decade ago, this may have been a great opportunity for the two leads to mine big laughs from a highly-contrived scenario, but here they're just too old to make the material sail. Matthau, in particular, doesn't seem as mobile, and Lemmon has to work overtime to make up for the obvious lethargy (not successful for a comedy). Dyan Cannon (doing an Ann-Margret) is sprightly, and familiar TV faces--plus a tap-dancing Donald O'Connor!--show up in small roles, however it is Brent Spiner as a wormy entertainment coordinator who steals the show. ** from ****

    A bit of the plot from Moon Over Miami and even more from The Monte Carlo Story has Walter Matthau as a degenerate footloose gambler getting a bit long in the tooth persuading an equally aged, but more square Jack Lemmon to take a cruise and try and fleece the old ladies in Out To Sea. Matthau needs Lemmon because Lemmon can cut it on a dance floor and he's signed them on as dancers for the unescorted women on the cruise. Of course Lemmon doesn't know that. What he does know that Matthau who is the brother of his late wife has come to him with one scheme after another for years. And Matthau owes some big money to the bookies and that's why he needs cash. So they go on the cruise and as for Matthau he gets involved with Dyan Cannon and her mother Elaine Stritch and its poker not the dance floor where he meets them. Matthau has to deal with a pompous Englishman in Edward Mulhare who really is a sitting target for Matthau's cons. As for Lemmon he gets involved with Gloria DeHaven who is accompanying her daughter and husband on a holiday. They don't think she gets out enough. Oddly enough that's how Matthau feels about Lemmon. As for the rest of the cast, Star Trek's Data Brent Spiner has a great part as an obnoxious twit of a performer and dancer who lords it over the others of greater talent who also include Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor. Matthau bounces some great lines off him and Spiner's reactions are priceless. I'd also have to single out Elaine Stritch who comes into her own explaining the facts of life to Cannon. During the Nineties we were fortunate indeed to have Lemmon and Matthau in some great films, specifically written for them. In Out To Sea you can see that a great supporting cast was assembled for them. Like some of the comedy teams, these two comic actors did variations on their first film together The Fortune Cookie where Matthau is the con artist who is always dragging Lemmon into one of his schemes. Out To Sea isn't as good as The Fortune Cookie or the first The Odd Couple, but it's still plenty funny.

    Once in a blue moon, along comes a film that is genuinely "sweet." This is one of those rare gems. Expertly directed by Martha Coolidge. What a fun ride this must have been for all concerned. There are legendary performers having a great time on screen and sadly most are now gone. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon have an on-screen give-and-take that is delicious and funny to watch (and Lemmon has a poignant and wistful scene as well.) Dyan Cannon(with a delightful giggle and a contagious laugh) and Gloria DeHaven are the romantic counterparts to Lemmon and Matthau and it's terrific to watch Edward Mulhare, the great Elaine Stritch, Rue McClanahan, Hal Linden, and wow ---there's Donald O'Connor showing he's still got it(wish his role was bigger.) Finally, although it would seem impossible to steal the movie from such greats Brent Spiner virtually pulls it off as the arrogant singing cruise director. (He should star in a TV sitcom. not too late!) His timing is superb. Along with established ballroom dancer, Andre Fortin, the dancing sequences would make "Dancing With the Stars" fans applaud with joy. Don't miss the added dancing sequence during the end credits with all of the stars and some funny outtakes. "Out to Sea" makes you want to finally book that seven day cruiseif only you could bump into these wonderful characters before you head back home.

    This movie didn't really make me laugh a lot. It gave me a few chuckles here and there. It felt more like a drama than a comedy. It was such a relief to see Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau performing together. They were funny here and there. The plot revolves around two men named Herb and Charlie (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthaue). Charlie might have found the woman of his dreams. He convinces his friends Herb to board a luxury cruise ship with him to pose as dancers for the ship while trying to get the woman of his dreams. Soon, Herb finds a woman he is in love with and poses as a doctor to win her over. The director on the luxury cruise gets suspicious of Charlie because he notices that he can't dance. Now, Herb and Charlie must make sure they don't blow their cover otherwise they'll be thrown overboard and owe over $5,000 instead of getting the free ride they were offered. The movie wasn't good. It wasn't bad either. Still, you should check it out. I give this movie 5 stars out of 10. It was alright!

    This is the kind of movie that people of a certain age will say of "I didn't think they made movies like that anymore". Walter Matthau gives his usual over-the-top performance, but instead of leaving teeth marks all over the scenery, leaves endearing grease stains. He is like that great uncle we all know that still wears plaid polyester and embarrasses everyone, but we still love anyway. Jack Lemmon's performance reminds us why he had more Golden Globe nominations than anyone else (22). He gives a true-to-life performance of the basically 'good, ordinary man', even in the milieu of a farce. This film will probably not appeal to people who prefer blunt humor designed to confront or offend, but will appeal to people who appreciate broad farce played with a straight face. The entire supporting cast is excellent in their ability to play such absurd characters while maintaining the reality of each character. Brent Spiner gives a marvelous performance as a professional version of a lounge lizard. Anyone who has known professional hosts in real life will immediately recognize the type he is playing. He nails the type perfectly. His rendition of 'slime' merits study as a perfect example of the contrast between absurd and pathetic. The plot is rather a straight-forward 'let's marry rich' theme that has the usual results. Just because a plot theme has been done a thousand times does not mean that it is dated, but rather that it is a timeless theme. The rest of the supporting cast shows what can happen when professionals exhibit their skills in the roles that are written for them, instead of vying for the spotlight. In this film even the second tier actors shine. It is also obvious that they enjoyed making this film. The plot may be standard and thin, but it allows the performers to shine. This film is a true treat for people who want to see professional actors engaging in their craft. The plot falls away and the performers shine.

    with two old friends. I've always enjoyed both Lemmon's and Mathaeu's films, and of course their team efforts are always worth watching, and often hilarious. Although I didn't personally regard this film as in the hilarious category, it is certainly a competent and entertaining vehicle for fans of the two principle actors and of 60s style romantic comedy plots. Brent Spiner may actually steal the show in terms of laughs as the arrogant and tyrannical Cruise Director. Gloria DeHaven proves that senior ladies can remain enormously attractive.

    Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, both of whom are sadly missed, proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their craft of bringing hilarious moments to the screen. This film is just another example of this. This time out they play two brothers-in-law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board. Of course, their boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named Gil Godwin who just enjoys harassing these boys. It's hilarious how Lemmon gives a quick lesson in dancing to Matthau and how the latter dances a riotous rumba with the boat's owner Rue McLanahan. Too bad that fellow dance instructors Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor are given so little to do but their parts call for that. Matthau falls for Dyan Cannon, on board with her fellow gold-digging mother, the usual outrageous Elaine Stritch. Unknown to them, Matthau has no money either. The widower Lemmon falls for Gloria De Haven, looking lovelier than ever. The film belongs to Matthau and Lemmon and will serve as a further tribute to their illustrious careers.

    I was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when I first saw it I was only mildly amused! I must say however, that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor wasn't given a bigger and better role! He was an enormous talent. There is a great chemistry among all the main cast members and Matthau has never been funnier. I am tremendously glad that this picture got made because we get to see Lemmon and Matthau team up for the very last time; in a vehicle that puts their talent to great use. Brent Spiner proves that "Data" from Star Trek the Next Geeration is not the only good character he can play. The storyline is really quite simple but the comedy and the characters work really well and I laughed heartily throughout this movie and I highly recommend it.

    "Out to Sea" was a vehicle for Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, a team of comedy actors that excelled in their different movies. This film seems to have been made after the success of "Grumpy Old Men", and it involves a cruise where the men will be involved in funny situations since they have been hired as male escorts to entertain the single women of a certain age that are attracted to this type of vacation. Martha Coolidge, the director, doesn't bring anything new to the picture. It's a formula movie, and as such, we know where it's going at all times. The best thing in the film is Brent Spinner, who is the cruise entertainment director, the man in charge of Herb and Charlie. This man, who loves to sing, supervises his domain with an iron fist and gets funny results. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau could do their Herb and Charlie well, as they proved in the many films they appeared together. Both actors have some good moments in the film. Dyan Cannon, Elaine Strich, and the lovely Gloria DeHaven, are good to see in any movie. Others in the cast include Rue McClanahan, Donnald O'Connor, Hal Linden, among others. Let's remember Mr. Lemmon and Mr. Matthau for other, better made movies than this one.

    Noticeably, if I review a comedy, I noticed that I lower my standard automatically in order to watch it. This could mean one of two things. Either: 1)I don't like to laugh.... Or: 2)the movie just isn't funny. It would have to be the second, because I do appreciate decent comedy. This is just not in that category. While it is not the worst, it is, as suggested, another "Grumpy Old Men" scenario. The scenes are at times a bit too embarrassing. Matthau, while funny, just too hard to believe as a card shark, even for a laugh. Dyan Cannon looks amazing for her age (Is she really 75?); there are several gratuitous bikini scenes to compliment her plastic surgeon. One great appearance by Elaine Stritch, always managing to be sarcastic and funny, even with minimal screen time. All in all, not the worst, you may get a few laughs. 5/10.

Matthau bounces some great lines off him and Spiner's reactions are priceless. I'd also have to single out Elaine Stritch who comes into her own explaining the facts of life to Cannon. During the Nineties we were fortunate indeed to have Lemmon and Matthau in some great films, specifically written for them. In Out To Sea you can see that a great supporting cast was assembled for them. Like some of the comedy teams, these two comic actors did variations on their first film together The Fortune Cookie where Matthau is the con artist who is always dragging Lemmon into one of his schemes. Out To Sea isn't as good as The Fortune Cookie or the first The Odd Couple, but it's still plenty funny.

    Once in a blue moon, along comes a film that is genuinely "sweet." This is one of those rare gems. Expertly directed by Martha Coolidge. What a fun ride this must have been for all concerned. There are legendary performers having a great time on screen and sadly most are now gone. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon have an on-screen give-and-take that is delicious and funny to watch (and Lemmon has a poignant and wistful scene as well.) Dyan Cannon(with a delightful giggle and a contagious laugh) and Gloria DeHaven are the romantic counterparts to Lemmon and Matthau and it's terrific to watch Edward Mulhare, the great Elaine Stritch, Rue McClanahan, Hal Linden, and wow ---there's Donald O'Connor showing he's still got it(wish his role was bigger.) Finally, although it would seem impossible to steal the movie from such greats Brent Spiner virtually pulls it off as the arrogant singing cruise director. (He should star in a TV sitcom. not too late!) His timing is superb. Along with established ballroom dancer, Andre Fortin, the dancing sequences would make "Dancing With the Stars" fans applaud with joy. Don't miss the added dancing sequence during the end credits with all of the stars and some funny outtakes. "Out to Sea" makes you want to finally book that seven day cruiseif only you could bump into these wonderful characters before you head back home.

    This movie didn't really make me laugh a lot. It gave me a few chuckles here and there. It felt more like a drama than a comedy. It was such a relief to see Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau performing together. They were funny here and there. The plot revolves around two men named Herb and Charlie (Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthaue). Charlie might have found the woman of his dreams. He convinces his friends Herb to board a luxury cruise ship with him to pose as dancers for the ship while trying to get the woman of his dreams. Soon, Herb finds a woman he is in love with and poses as a doctor to win her over. The director on the luxury cruise gets suspicious of Charlie because he notices that he can't dance. Now, Herb and Charlie must make sure they don't blow their cover otherwise they'll be thrown overboard and owe over $5,000 instead of getting the free ride they were offered. The movie wasn't good. It wasn't bad either. Still, you should check it out. I give this movie 5 stars out of 10. It was alright!

    This is the kind of movie that people of a certain age will say of "I didn't think they made movies like that anymore". Walter Matthau gives his usual over-the-top performance, but instead of leaving teeth marks all over the scenery, leaves endearing grease stains. He is like that great uncle we all know that still wears plaid polyester and embarrasses everyone, but we still love anyway. Jack Lemmon's performance reminds us why he had more Golden Globe nominations than anyone else (22). He gives a true-to-life performance of the basically 'good, ordinary man', even in the milieu of a farce. This film will probably not appeal to people who prefer blunt humor designed to confront or offend, but will appeal to people who appreciate broad farce played with a straight face. The entire supporting cast is excellent in their ability to play such absurd characters while maintaining the reality of each character. Brent Spiner gives a marvelous performance as a professional version of a lounge lizard. Anyone who has known professional hosts in real life will immediately recognize the type he is playing. He nails the type perfectly. His rendition of 'slime' merits study as a perfect example of the contrast between absurd and pathetic. The plot is rather a straight-forward 'let's marry rich' theme that has the usual results. Just because a plot theme has been done a thousand times does not mean that it is dated, but rather that it is a timeless theme. The rest of the supporting cast shows what can happen when professionals exhibit their skills in the roles that are written for them, instead of vying for the spotlight. In this film even the second tier actors shine. It is also obvious that they enjoyed making this film. The plot may be standard and thin, but it allows the performers to shine. This film is a true treat for people who want to see professional actors engaging in their craft. The plot falls away and the performers shine.

    with two old friends. I've always enjoyed both Lemmon's and Mathaeu's films, and of course their team efforts are always worth watching, and often hilarious. Although I didn't personally regard this film as in the hilarious category, it is certainly a competent and entertaining vehicle for fans of the two principle actors and of 60s style romantic comedy plots. Brent Spiner may actually steal the show in terms of laughs as the arrogant and tyrannical Cruise Director. Gloria DeHaven proves that senior ladies can remain enormously attractive.

    Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, both of whom are sadly missed, proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their craft of bringing hilarious moments to the screen. This film is just another example of this. This time out they play two brothers-in-law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board. Of course, their boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named Gil Godwin who just enjoys harassing these boys. It's hilarious how Lemmon gives a quick lesson in dancing to Matthau and how the latter dances a riotous rumba with the boat's owner Rue McLanahan. Too bad that fellow dance instructors Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor are given so little to do but their parts call for that. Matthau falls for Dyan Cannon, on board with her fellow gold-digging mother, the usual outrageous Elaine Stritch. Unknown to them, Matthau has no money either. The widower Lemmon falls for Gloria De Haven, looking lovelier than ever. The film belongs to Matthau and Lemmon and will serve as a further tribute to their illustrious careers.

    I was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when I first saw it I was only mildly amused! I must say however, that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor wasn't given a bigger and better role! He was an enormous talent. There is a great chemistry among all the main cast members and Matthau has never been funnier. I am tremendously glad that this picture got made because we get to see Lemmon and Matthau team up for the very last time; in a vehicle that puts their talent to great use. Brent Spiner proves that "Data" from Star Trek the Next Geeration is not the only good character he can play. The storyline is really quite simple but the comedy and the characters work really well and I laughed heartily throughout this movie and I highly recommend it.

    "Out to Sea" was a vehicle for Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, a team of comedy actors that excelled in their different movies. This film seems to have been made after the success of "Grumpy Old Men", and it involves a cruise where the men will be involved in funny situations since they have been hired as male escorts to entertain the single women of a certain age that are attracted to this type of vacation. Martha Coolidge, the director, doesn't bring anything new to the picture. It's a formula movie, and as such, we know where it's going at all times. The best thing in the film is Brent Spinner, who is the cruise entertainment director, the man in charge of Herb and Charlie. This man, who loves to sing, supervises his domain with an iron fist and gets funny results. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau could do their Herb and Charlie well, as they proved in the many films they appeared together. Both actors have some good moments in the film. Dyan Cannon, Elaine Strich, and the lovely Gloria DeHaven, are good to see in any movie. Others in the cast include Rue McClanahan, Donnald O'Connor, Hal Linden, among others. Let's remember Mr. Lemmon and Mr. Matthau for other, better made movies than this one.

    Noticeably, if I review a comedy, I noticed that I lower my standard automatically in order to watch it. This could mean one of two things. Either: 1)I don't like to laugh.... Or: 2)the movie just isn't funny. It would have to be the second, because I do appreciate decent comedy. This is just not in that category. While it is not the worst, it is, as suggested, another "Grumpy Old Men" scenario. The scenes are at times a bit too embarrassing. Matthau, while funny, just too hard to believe as a card shark, even for a laugh. Dyan Cannon looks amazing for her age (Is she really 75?); there are several gratuitous bikini scenes to compliment her plastic surgeon. One great appearance by Elaine Stritch, always managing to be sarcastic and funny, even with minimal screen time. All in all, not the worst, you may get a few laughs. 5/10.
