    A seemingly forgotten piece of Cyberpunk that traded heavily on pre-millennium hysteria, I hadn't seen 'Strange Days' since it was released. I certainly remember liking it... well, respecting it would be more accurate. I thought it was well made, but it wasn't the type of film I was itching to watch again any time soon. Fast forward nearly 20 years, and I got the itch again. My reaction now is pretty much the same as it was then. It's very well made (Directed by Kathryn Bigelow and co-written by then husband James Cameron). The cast is strong as well. Generally I find Ralph Fiennes a bore, but he's great here, showing more personality and life than I've ever seen from him before. Culturally it's a bit dated, but overall it holds up quite well. Not sure why this one seems to have slipped through the cracks. It's a very solid sci-fi thriller.

    This is a movie with so much potential but never really quite lives up to it. It's a great film which could have been the Blade Runner of its' time but just didn't quite make it. A fabulous performance from Ralph Fiennes, playing so much against type but succeeding brilliantly, even his American accent is convincing (at least to my British ears). Angela Bassett is simply a revelation, her amazing Mace a long way from her Tina Turner. Great supporting cast too especially from Tom Sizemore and William Fichtner as two police officers who suddenly find themselves in way over their heads. It is quite simply far too long, you could have cut out nearly all of the nightclub sequences and not lost anything. Of course we all know that the millennium turned out to be not anything like as it is depicted but in the post Rodney King era this didn't seem that far fetched. I simply cannot watch the scene where Iris is murdered in the bathtub, it is so horrible it beggars belief. You would say that this is a misogynist film if it wasn't written and directed by woman. It's hard to keep track of the plot but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Great central concept, wouldn't it be fantastic to be able to experience other peoples memories? The blazing limo scene is just terrific and Lenny is a surprisingly likable hero for such a dirtbag hustler (not least for the scene where he gives his friend in the wheelchair a clip of jogging along the beach). Laughed out loud at the sequence where he goes to confront the burglar in his flat only to realise he forgot to load his gun. Love, love, love the ending, the final kiss and embrace what we've all been rooting for all along. Adore the image of the hippy girl kissing the National Guardsman on top of the tank, just so beautiful, much like the LAPD coming good at the end showing humanity can prevail against all odds. And Mace and Lenny can get together and live happily ever after. Great music as well (the nightclub numbers aside) and adore Juliette Lewis character telling Lenny it's over, just pipping Mace reminding him that memories are meant to fade. A marvellous film that really deserved to do better at the box office.

    This 1995 movie takes place on December 30 and 31 1999. It's about a hustler named Lenny (Ralph Fiennes) who sells dreams (so to speak). You put on a device that covers the top of your head, insert a disc and it plays an experience that someone else had...but you see it through their eyes and hear it too. It's like a drug...very addictive. Then a friend of his is brutally murdered for a disc that has incriminating evidence against the LAPD that could lead to a war. Soon Lenny and ex-girlfriend Lornette (Angela Bassett) are running for their lives from people who will kill them for the disc. The plot is kind of hard to describe but the movie is fascinating. I first saw it up a theatre in stereo on a large screen and it blew me away. The imagery is incredible (excellent direction by Kathryn Bigelow) and the sound mix inventive. The movie isn't easy to watch at times--there's a VERY graphic sequence where a woman is tortured, raped and murdered--but it is needed for the plot. The plot is involved but I was never confused. The acting is, for the most part, great. Fiennes is great and Bassett is just incredible. They're both great actors and give their all to this. Tom Sizemore has a small role and he's pretty good. However Juliette Lewis is terrible as an ex of Lenny. Very wooden. The only real bad thing is the climax--it goes on for far too long (this movie doesn't have to run 145 minutes). This was lost back in 1995 and didn't even become known when director Bigelow won an Oscar for "The Hurt Locker"--but it deserves recognition. Well worth seeing.

    Despite the fact that this review is being written approximately 17 years after the release of Strange Days, I can't seem to shake the feeling that Kathryn Bigelow and James Cameron's dystopian drama about selling memories on the black market has a clear vision of the future not just of LA but of the United States. Police brutality, anarchic riots and a nihilistic atmosphere all contribute to the dark and edgy tone of the film which begins so brilliantly that it would be hard- pressed to maintain such a high order. Unfortunately, that is the case. The opening sequence is shot from entirely one character's POV as hand-held cameras swirl around freely, taking in all the action with such rabid voyeurism that it would suck almost anyone into watching intently. What follows is a film with some impressive questions and issues to raise but ultimately sifts them through a mostly standard action plot involving numerous beatings, chase sequences and even a few scenes of rape. Needless to say, these plot devices are not entirely necessary to explore these ideas but Bigelow makes it work for the most part, using every camera and editing trick in her arsenal. The screenplay, co- written by James Cameron, has his usual breathless action scenes as well as tight pacing that takes us right up to a number of stunning conclusions that by the very end topple over one another. Perhaps it is a bit too ambitious, but this film does deserve to be called the "Blade Runner of the 1990s" and boasts some very fine performances, not the least of which belongs to the amazingly versatile Ralph Fiennes. All in all, this is an action film worth checking out if only for the incredible techniques implemented to fulfill its vision. The problem lies within the vision, which is overstuffed and at times difficult to entirely comprehend.

    In a futuristic world, black market virtual reality is all the rage. Ex-Cop Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is the guy you go to for all your virtual dreams. He can get you anything from the ultimate vacation to porno and everything in between. Nero's world is soon to be turned upside when on the eve of the millennium, he receives a tape which contains the murder of someone he knows. Many people don't know this, but Strange Days was actually written by famed Director, James Cameron, shortly before he did Titanic, a stark contrast from one project to the other. The mystery of Strange Days, as well as the machine, are cool as hell. What's not is how it ended, because once you find out who and why, you can pretty much figure out the rest, making the last half hour of the film unnecessary. Fiennes is the star and does a pretty good job, but the one who really impressed me was Angela Bassett. She plays his bad ass partner, Mace, and she was really something to see. Strange days is something different in many ways, but it's also predictable, repetitive, and anti-climactic in others. It's a cool film and a different story, but most of the acting is weak, and the story repeats itself leading up to its predictable ending.

    if you like nudity and violence, then this may be the movie for you. otherwise, you'll probably find it a waste of time, and maybe even offensive. personally, i find nudity and violence hackneyed. the acting was pretty bad. i mean, there were a lot of people in the movie. so if a fifth of them did a terrible job, then it shows. the plot was wanting also. the whole world isn't in some drug and alcohol induced riot. people just don't behave this way. then, if they did, there's the national guard. and martial law. where was that ? it just didn't cut it for me, and a poor choice in case you were watching it with a date. my recommendation for a strange off-the-wall movie: requiem for a dream.

    This is not a good movie. It felt like there was a good story buried here somewhere, like the movie had been poorly adapted from a Philip Dick novel. But this movie starts out mediocre, gets worse, and by the end is a laugher. The dialogue, characters, and plot are cheesy and clich&eacute;d. It's directed and shot like TV movie. The racial and gender themes are tacked on, do not feel authentic, and are never seriously addressed. The "surprise" was not particularly surprising. And on top of all that, it is long: almost 2 and a half hours. Ralph Fiennes is just about always watchable, and Juliette Lewis is topless several times. Other than that, there's very little to recommend here.

    Kathryn Bigelow directs a story and screenplay by James Cameron called "Strange Days." Made in 1995, the film is set in dark, chaotic 1999 as it heads toward 2000. Many feel 2000 will mark the end of the world - sound familiar? - but as we now know, 9/11 hadn't happened yet, and the date of the Rapture has been moved yet again. Ralph Fiennes is Lenny Nero, an ex-cop turned bootlegger dealing in illegal "squid" recordings - virtual-reality type tapes actually made from the cerebral cortex so that the viewer experiences true emotions as if the viewer were actually there. Lenny depends on a friend, Mace (Angela Bassett) while he still loves his ex-girlfriend, a singer named Faith (Juliette Lewis). A prostitute, Iris (Brigitte Bako) doing recordings for Lenny records something that soon gets Iris savagely murdered and Lenny and Mace running for their lives. There are some spectacular scenes. The best one (as far as I'm concerned) is with Lenny and Mace in Mace's car while they're being shot at and then set on fire. Don't miss it! Both Fiennes and Bassett are fantastic, and it would be hard to say which one is better. Bassett gives new meaning to the words "girl power" and Fiennes somehow makes his sleazoid character likable and sad. The support from Tom Sizemore, Vincent D'Onofrio et al. is tremendous. Great action from two masters - recommended.

    Strange Days is a very interesting and enjoyable cyber-punk-esque, end-of-the-millennium detective film. Set about four years after it was released (1995, i believe) its world is a close future in which Los Angeles is being torn apart by race riots and police brutality - all washed down with a hedonistic population clamouring for new sensations. Here we find the science-ficiton device. The "SQUID" prosthesis which allows peoples experiences to be recorded, reproduced and sold on the black market for people to experience for themselves. The story follows Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) into an intriguing and disturbing detective story centring on a murder recorded by one of these devices. Not only does the film flesh itself out with violence, car chases, and a pretty massive party but, through its use of the SQUID device, it allows for a good detective story to ask interesting questions about bodily experience - and the nature of that when it becomes recordable (turned into information) and sellable - when it becomes currency. So where is there fault with this film? (7*?) Well there isn't much really. At times the film's 'bad guy' seems to become that 90s villain we've seen so many times. And I think the plot-twist and the ending were both rather forced(but this is pretty big-budget stuff, so...). I could go on and list things which I think could have been better about the film but that would be not only useless but arrogant. This is a great film which, despite falling into a few of the usual traps, deals with some interesting themes and is very enjoyable to watch (and has some alright music in it too) - This is a film of its time which is defiantly worth watching.

    I had no idea this film even existed until it showed up in my Netflix 'recommended' column, and I decided to give it a shot after reading some good reviews on there. Wow, am I happy I did. This was a truly fantastic sci-fi thriller, with intense action and a truly engaging story. The characters were very well constructed and had a lot of substance to them, and of course the acting was superb. Who knew Ralph Finnes could play such a good lowlife? Set in an alternate (but totally recognizable) Los Angeles of 1999, the world has seemingly gone completely to hell, due to rampant poverty and class/racial tensions which are pushing society towards an all-out state of anarchy. The authorities are barely maintaining order, despite resorting to draconian measures to try and keep things in check. The director does an excellent job of painting this picture for us through fantastic environment and background shots which effectively build the tension and make us fully believe what is happening. In this world, they have invented a type of virtual reality which allows an individual to record everything they are seeing and feeling directly through their brain, so as to then be played back later through someone else's brain, which allows the user to then see and feel exactly what was recorded without any danger (other than possible addiction). So needless to say a huge black market has sprung up to provide people with recordings of all kinds of illicit, criminal and sexual activities that they'd never actually get to experience in the real world. The plot of the movie builds from this technology. However, other than this particular device and general state of social affairs, the alternate 1999 is pretty much identical to our 1999 (very much to it's credit). No flying cars, no wacky fashion, no aliens, no laser guns or anything like that. It was a great decision by the filmmakers to not bite off more than they could chew in that regard, as it would have distracted from a very solid story. The films weaknesses are few, but are there nonetheless. It was a bit long... although I'm not usually one to complain about that kind of thing, so long as the time is necessary to tell the story. In this case an argument can be made either way, though I personally feel they could have lost about fifteen minutes or so (but to me it's a minor issue). The director also felt the need to very quickly explain the origin of the virtual reality technology through a throwaway line of dialog, which really added nothing to the plot, and honestly made no sense; they said the technology was originally developed for the FBI so that informants wouldn't have to wear a wire, which is just dumb. The device is WAY more cumbersome and easily discoverable than a wire transmitter. How about saying that the military invented it to train soldiers more realistically? Or just leave it alone... true virtual reality is a technological holy grail. I don't think anyone questions why something like that would be invented in the first place, even if it's purely for entertainment. Additionally, in my opinion, a couple of the 'bad guys' could have had their motivations fleshed out a tad better, but that is a also very minor quibble. Beyond that, the look of the movie is quite dated, which could hinder the enjoyment for some people. The 1990's did not age very well to our eyes, and this movie is VERY much a product of that era. If you lived through it, you know what I mean. Younger viewers may not fully get the social and cultural allusions that this movie is built upon (Rodney King riots, 90's hip hop culture, rave clubs... things like that)... just something to keep in mind, although if you did live though it, you'll appreciate the depth that these references add. But really, I can't recommend this film highly enough. It's a completely under-appreciated piece of work, and one of the best sci-fi thrillers out there.

And on top of all that, it is long: almost 2 and a half hours. Ralph Fiennes is just about always watchable, and Juliette Lewis is topless several times. Other than that, there's very little to recommend here.

    Kathryn Bigelow directs a story and screenplay by James Cameron called "Strange Days." Made in 1995, the film is set in dark, chaotic 1999 as it heads toward 2000. Many feel 2000 will mark the end of the world - sound familiar? - but as we now know, 9/11 hadn't happened yet, and the date of the Rapture has been moved yet again. Ralph Fiennes is Lenny Nero, an ex-cop turned bootlegger dealing in illegal "squid" recordings - virtual-reality type tapes actually made from the cerebral cortex so that the viewer experiences true emotions as if the viewer were actually there. Lenny depends on a friend, Mace (Angela Bassett) while he still loves his ex-girlfriend, a singer named Faith (Juliette Lewis). A prostitute, Iris (Brigitte Bako) doing recordings for Lenny records something that soon gets Iris savagely murdered and Lenny and Mace running for their lives. There are some spectacular scenes. The best one (as far as I'm concerned) is with Lenny and Mace in Mace's car while they're being shot at and then set on fire. Don't miss it! Both Fiennes and Bassett are fantastic, and it would be hard to say which one is better. Bassett gives new meaning to the words "girl power" and Fiennes somehow makes his sleazoid character likable and sad. The support from Tom Sizemore, Vincent D'Onofrio et al. is tremendous. Great action from two masters - recommended.

    Strange Days is a very interesting and enjoyable cyber-punk-esque, end-of-the-millennium detective film. Set about four years after it was released (1995, i believe) its world is a close future in which Los Angeles is being torn apart by race riots and police brutality - all washed down with a hedonistic population clamouring for new sensations. Here we find the science-ficiton device. The "SQUID" prosthesis which allows peoples experiences to be recorded, reproduced and sold on the black market for people to experience for themselves. The story follows Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) into an intriguing and disturbing detective story centring on a murder recorded by one of these devices. Not only does the film flesh itself out with violence, car chases, and a pretty massive party but, through its use of the SQUID device, it allows for a good detective story to ask interesting questions about bodily experience - and the nature of that when it becomes recordable (turned into information) and sellable - when it becomes currency. So where is there fault with this film? (7*?) Well there isn't much really. At times the film's 'bad guy' seems to become that 90s villain we've seen so many times. And I think the plot-twist and the ending were both rather forced(but this is pretty big-budget stuff, so...). I could go on and list things which I think could have been better about the film but that would be not only useless but arrogant. This is a great film which, despite falling into a few of the usual traps, deals with some interesting themes and is very enjoyable to watch (and has some alright music in it too) - This is a film of its time which is defiantly worth watching.

    I had no idea this film even existed until it showed up in my Netflix 'recommended' column, and I decided to give it a shot after reading some good reviews on there. Wow, am I happy I did. This was a truly fantastic sci-fi thriller, with intense action and a truly engaging story. The characters were very well constructed and had a lot of substance to them, and of course the acting was superb. Who knew Ralph Finnes could play such a good lowlife? Set in an alternate (but totally recognizable) Los Angeles of 1999, the world has seemingly gone completely to hell, due to rampant poverty and class/racial tensions which are pushing society towards an all-out state of anarchy. The authorities are barely maintaining order, despite resorting to draconian measures to try and keep things in check. The director does an excellent job of painting this picture for us through fantastic environment and background shots which effectively build the tension and make us fully believe what is happening. In this world, they have invented a type of virtual reality which allows an individual to record everything they are seeing and feeling directly through their brain, so as to then be played back later through someone else's brain, which allows the user to then see and feel exactly what was recorded without any danger (other than possible addiction). So needless to say a huge black market has sprung up to provide people with recordings of all kinds of illicit, criminal and sexual activities that they'd never actually get to experience in the real world. The plot of the movie builds from this technology. However, other than this particular device and general state of social affairs, the alternate 1999 is pretty much identical to our 1999 (very much to it's credit). No flying cars, no wacky fashion, no aliens, no laser guns or anything like that. It was a great decision by the filmmakers to not bite off more than they could chew in that regard, as it would have distracted from a very solid story. The films weaknesses are few, but are there nonetheless. It was a bit long... although I'm not usually one to complain about that kind of thing, so long as the time is necessary to tell the story. In this case an argument can be made either way, though I personally feel they could have lost about fifteen minutes or so (but to me it's a minor issue). The director also felt the need to very quickly explain the origin of the virtual reality technology through a throwaway line of dialog, which really added nothing to the plot, and honestly made no sense; they said the technology was originally developed for the FBI so that informants wouldn't have to wear a wire, which is just dumb. The device is WAY more cumbersome and easily discoverable than a wire transmitter. How about saying that the military invented it to train soldiers more realistically? Or just leave it alone... true virtual reality is a technological holy grail. I don't think anyone questions why something like that would be invented in the first place, even if it's purely for entertainment. Additionally, in my opinion, a couple of the 'bad guys' could have had their motivations fleshed out a tad better, but that is a also very minor quibble. Beyond that, the look of the movie is quite dated, which could hinder the enjoyment for some people. The 1990's did not age very well to our eyes, and this movie is VERY much a product of that era. If you lived through it, you know what I mean. Younger viewers may not fully get the social and cultural allusions that this movie is built upon (Rodney King riots, 90's hip hop culture, rave clubs... things like that)... just something to keep in mind, although if you did live though it, you'll appreciate the depth that these references add. But really, I can't recommend this film highly enough. It's a completely under-appreciated piece of work, and one of the best sci-fi thrillers out there.

    A seemingly forgotten piece of Cyberpunk that traded heavily on pre-millennium hysteria, I hadn't seen 'Strange Days' since it was released. I certainly remember liking it... well, respecting it would be more accurate. I thought it was well made, but it wasn't the type of film I was itching to watch again any time soon. Fast forward nearly 20 years, and I got the itch again. My reaction now is pretty much the same as it was then. It's very well made (Directed by Kathryn Bigelow and co-written by then husband James Cameron). The cast is strong as well. Generally I find Ralph Fiennes a bore, but he's great here, showing more personality and life than I've ever seen from him before. Culturally it's a bit dated, but overall it holds up quite well. Not sure why this one seems to have slipped through the cracks. It's a very solid sci-fi thriller.

    This is a movie with so much potential but never really quite lives up to it. It's a great film which could have been the Blade Runner of its' time but just didn't quite make it. A fabulous performance from Ralph Fiennes, playing so much against type but succeeding brilliantly, even his American accent is convincing (at least to my British ears). Angela Bassett is simply a revelation, her amazing Mace a long way from her Tina Turner. Great supporting cast too especially from Tom Sizemore and William Fichtner as two police officers who suddenly find themselves in way over their heads. It is quite simply far too long, you could have cut out nearly all of the nightclub sequences and not lost anything. Of course we all know that the millennium turned out to be not anything like as it is depicted but in the post Rodney King era this didn't seem that far fetched. I simply cannot watch the scene where Iris is murdered in the bathtub, it is so horrible it beggars belief. You would say that this is a misogynist film if it wasn't written and directed by woman. It's hard to keep track of the plot but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Great central concept, wouldn't it be fantastic to be able to experience other peoples memories? The blazing limo scene is just terrific and Lenny is a surprisingly likable hero for such a dirtbag hustler (not least for the scene where he gives his friend in the wheelchair a clip of jogging along the beach). Laughed out loud at the sequence where he goes to confront the burglar in his flat only to realise he forgot to load his gun. Love, love, love the ending, the final kiss and embrace what we've all been rooting for all along. Adore the image of the hippy girl kissing the National Guardsman on top of the tank, just so beautiful, much like the LAPD coming good at the end showing humanity can prevail against all odds. And Mace and Lenny can get together and live happily ever after. Great music as well (the nightclub numbers aside) and adore Juliette Lewis character telling Lenny it's over, just pipping Mace reminding him that memories are meant to fade. A marvellous film that really deserved to do better at the box office.

    This 1995 movie takes place on December 30 and 31 1999. It's about a hustler named Lenny (Ralph Fiennes) who sells dreams (so to speak). You put on a device that covers the top of your head, insert a disc and it plays an experience that someone else had...but you see it through their eyes and hear it too. It's like a drug...very addictive. Then a friend of his is brutally murdered for a disc that has incriminating evidence against the LAPD that could lead to a war. Soon Lenny and ex-girlfriend Lornette (Angela Bassett) are running for their lives from people who will kill them for the disc. The plot is kind of hard to describe but the movie is fascinating. I first saw it up a theatre in stereo on a large screen and it blew me away. The imagery is incredible (excellent direction by Kathryn Bigelow) and the sound mix inventive. The movie isn't easy to watch at times--there's a VERY graphic sequence where a woman is tortured, raped and murdered--but it is needed for the plot. The plot is involved but I was never confused. The acting is, for the most part, great. Fiennes is great and Bassett is just incredible. They're both great actors and give their all to this. Tom Sizemore has a small role and he's pretty good. However Juliette Lewis is terrible as an ex of Lenny. Very wooden. The only real bad thing is the climax--it goes on for far too long (this movie doesn't have to run 145 minutes). This was lost back in 1995 and didn't even become known when director Bigelow won an Oscar for "The Hurt Locker"--but it deserves recognition. Well worth seeing.

    Despite the fact that this review is being written approximately 17 years after the release of Strange Days, I can't seem to shake the feeling that Kathryn Bigelow and James Cameron's dystopian drama about selling memories on the black market has a clear vision of the future not just of LA but of the United States. Police brutality, anarchic riots and a nihilistic atmosphere all contribute to the dark and edgy tone of the film which begins so brilliantly that it would be hard- pressed to maintain such a high order. Unfortunately, that is the case. The opening sequence is shot from entirely one character's POV as hand-held cameras swirl around freely, taking in all the action with such rabid voyeurism that it would suck almost anyone into watching intently. What follows is a film with some impressive questions and issues to raise but ultimately sifts them through a mostly standard action plot involving numerous beatings, chase sequences and even a few scenes of rape. Needless to say, these plot devices are not entirely necessary to explore these ideas but Bigelow makes it work for the most part, using every camera and editing trick in her arsenal. The screenplay, co- written by James Cameron, has his usual breathless action scenes as well as tight pacing that takes us right up to a number of stunning conclusions that by the very end topple over one another. Perhaps it is a bit too ambitious, but this film does deserve to be called the "Blade Runner of the 1990s" and boasts some very fine performances, not the least of which belongs to the amazingly versatile Ralph Fiennes. All in all, this is an action film worth checking out if only for the incredible techniques implemented to fulfill its vision. The problem lies within the vision, which is overstuffed and at times difficult to entirely comprehend.

    In a futuristic world, black market virtual reality is all the rage. Ex-Cop Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is the guy you go to for all your virtual dreams. He can get you anything from the ultimate vacation to porno and everything in between. Nero's world is soon to be turned upside when on the eve of the millennium, he receives a tape which contains the murder of someone he knows. Many people don't know this, but Strange Days was actually written by famed Director, James Cameron, shortly before he did Titanic, a stark contrast from one project to the other. The mystery of Strange Days, as well as the machine, are cool as hell. What's not is how it ended, because once you find out who and why, you can pretty much figure out the rest, making the last half hour of the film unnecessary. Fiennes is the star and does a pretty good job, but the one who really impressed me was Angela Bassett. She plays his bad ass partner, Mace, and she was really something to see. Strange days is something different in many ways, but it's also predictable, repetitive, and anti-climactic in others. It's a cool film and a different story, but most of the acting is weak, and the story repeats itself leading up to its predictable ending.

    if you like nudity and violence, then this may be the movie for you. otherwise, you'll probably find it a waste of time, and maybe even offensive. personally, i find nudity and violence hackneyed. the acting was pretty bad. i mean, there were a lot of people in the movie. so if a fifth of them did a terrible job, then it shows. the plot was wanting also. the whole world isn't in some drug and alcohol induced riot. people just don't behave this way. then, if they did, there's the national guard. and martial law. where was that ? it just didn't cut it for me, and a poor choice in case you were watching it with a date. my recommendation for a strange off-the-wall movie: requiem for a dream.

    This is not a good movie. It felt like there was a good story buried here somewhere, like the movie had been poorly adapted from a Philip Dick novel. But this movie starts out mediocre, gets worse, and by the end is a laugher. The dialogue, characters, and plot are cheesy and clich&eacute;d. It's directed and shot like TV movie. The racial and gender themes are tacked on, do not feel authentic, and are never seriously addressed. The "surprise" was not particularly surprising.

    Strange Days is a very interesting and enjoyable cyber-punk-esque, end-of-the-millennium detective film. Set about four years after it was released (1995, i believe) its world is a close future in which Los Angeles is being torn apart by race riots and police brutality - all washed down with a hedonistic population clamouring for new sensations. Here we find the science-ficiton device. The "SQUID" prosthesis which allows peoples experiences to be recorded, reproduced and sold on the black market for people to experience for themselves. The story follows Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) into an intriguing and disturbing detective story centring on a murder recorded by one of these devices. Not only does the film flesh itself out with violence, car chases, and a pretty massive party but, through its use of the SQUID device, it allows for a good detective story to ask interesting questions about bodily experience - and the nature of that when it becomes recordable (turned into information) and sellable - when it becomes currency. So where is there fault with this film? (7*?) Well there isn't much really. At times the film's 'bad guy' seems to become that 90s villain we've seen so many times. And I think the plot-twist and the ending were both rather forced(but this is pretty big-budget stuff, so...). I could go on and list things which I think could have been better about the film but that would be not only useless but arrogant. This is a great film which, despite falling into a few of the usual traps, deals with some interesting themes and is very enjoyable to watch (and has some alright music in it too) - This is a film of its time which is defiantly worth watching.

    This 1995 movie takes place on December 30 and 31 1999. It's about a hustler named Lenny (Ralph Fiennes) who sells dreams (so to speak). You put on a device that covers the top of your head, insert a disc and it plays an experience that someone else had...but you see it through their eyes and hear it too. It's like a drug...very addictive. Then a friend of his is brutally murdered for a disc that has incriminating evidence against the LAPD that could lead to a war. Soon Lenny and ex-girlfriend Lornette (Angela Bassett) are running for their lives from people who will kill them for the disc. The plot is kind of hard to describe but the movie is fascinating. I first saw it up a theatre in stereo on a large screen and it blew me away. The imagery is incredible (excellent direction by Kathryn Bigelow) and the sound mix inventive. The movie isn't easy to watch at times--there's a VERY graphic sequence where a woman is tortured, raped and murdered--but it is needed for the plot. The plot is involved but I was never confused. The acting is, for the most part, great. Fiennes is great and Bassett is just incredible. They're both great actors and give their all to this. Tom Sizemore has a small role and he's pretty good. However Juliette Lewis is terrible as an ex of Lenny. Very wooden. The only real bad thing is the climax--it goes on for far too long (this movie doesn't have to run 145 minutes). This was lost back in 1995 and didn't even become known when director Bigelow won an Oscar for "The Hurt Locker"--but it deserves recognition. Well worth seeing.

    Despite the fact that this review is being written approximately 17 years after the release of Strange Days, I can't seem to shake the feeling that Kathryn Bigelow and James Cameron's dystopian drama about selling memories on the black market has a clear vision of the future not just of LA but of the United States. Police brutality, anarchic riots and a nihilistic atmosphere all contribute to the dark and edgy tone of the film which begins so brilliantly that it would be hard- pressed to maintain such a high order. Unfortunately, that is the case. The opening sequence is shot from entirely one character's POV as hand-held cameras swirl around freely, taking in all the action with such rabid voyeurism that it would suck almost anyone into watching intently. What follows is a film with some impressive questions and issues to raise but ultimately sifts them through a mostly standard action plot involving numerous beatings, chase sequences and even a few scenes of rape. Needless to say, these plot devices are not entirely necessary to explore these ideas but Bigelow makes it work for the most part, using every camera and editing trick in her arsenal. The screenplay, co- written by James Cameron, has his usual breathless action scenes as well as tight pacing that takes us right up to a number of stunning conclusions that by the very end topple over one another. Perhaps it is a bit too ambitious, but this film does deserve to be called the "Blade Runner of the 1990s" and boasts some very fine performances, not the least of which belongs to the amazingly versatile Ralph Fiennes. All in all, this is an action film worth checking out if only for the incredible techniques implemented to fulfill its vision. The problem lies within the vision, which is overstuffed and at times difficult to entirely comprehend.

    In a futuristic world, black market virtual reality is all the rage. Ex-Cop Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is the guy you go to for all your virtual dreams. He can get you anything from the ultimate vacation to porno and everything in between. Nero's world is soon to be turned upside when on the eve of the millennium, he receives a tape which contains the murder of someone he knows. Many people don't know this, but Strange Days was actually written by famed Director, James Cameron, shortly before he did Titanic, a stark contrast from one project to the other. The mystery of Strange Days, as well as the machine, are cool as hell. What's not is how it ended, because once you find out who and why, you can pretty much figure out the rest, making the last half hour of the film unnecessary. Fiennes is the star and does a pretty good job, but the one who really impressed me was Angela Bassett. She plays his bad ass partner, Mace, and she was really something to see. Strange days is something different in many ways, but it's also predictable, repetitive, and anti-climactic in others. It's a cool film and a different story, but most of the acting is weak, and the story repeats itself leading up to its predictable ending.

    if you like nudity and violence, then this may be the movie for you. otherwise, you'll probably find it a waste of time, and maybe even offensive. personally, i find nudity and violence hackneyed. the acting was pretty bad. i mean, there were a lot of people in the movie. so if a fifth of them did a terrible job, then it shows. the plot was wanting also. the whole world isn't in some drug and alcohol induced riot. people just don't behave this way. then, if they did, there's the national guard. and martial law. where was that ? it just didn't cut it for me, and a poor choice in case you were watching it with a date. my recommendation for a strange off-the-wall movie: requiem for a dream.

    This is not a good movie. It felt like there was a good story buried here somewhere, like the movie had been poorly adapted from a Philip Dick novel. But this movie starts out mediocre, gets worse, and by the end is a laugher. The dialogue, characters, and plot are cheesy and clich&eacute;d. It's directed and shot like TV movie. The racial and gender themes are tacked on, do not feel authentic, and are never seriously addressed. The "surprise" was not particularly surprising. And on top of all that, it is long: almost 2 and a half hours. Ralph Fiennes is just about always watchable, and Juliette Lewis is topless several times. Other than that, there's very little to recommend here.

    Kathryn Bigelow directs a story and screenplay by James Cameron called "Strange Days." Made in 1995, the film is set in dark, chaotic 1999 as it heads toward 2000. Many feel 2000 will mark the end of the world - sound familiar? - but as we now know, 9/11 hadn't happened yet, and the date of the Rapture has been moved yet again. Ralph Fiennes is Lenny Nero, an ex-cop turned bootlegger dealing in illegal "squid" recordings - virtual-reality type tapes actually made from the cerebral cortex so that the viewer experiences true emotions as if the viewer were actually there. Lenny depends on a friend, Mace (Angela Bassett) while he still loves his ex-girlfriend, a singer named Faith (Juliette Lewis). A prostitute, Iris (Brigitte Bako) doing recordings for Lenny records something that soon gets Iris savagely murdered and Lenny and Mace running for their lives. There are some spectacular scenes. The best one (as far as I'm concerned) is with Lenny and Mace in Mace's car while they're being shot at and then set on fire. Don't miss it! Both Fiennes and Bassett are fantastic, and it would be hard to say which one is better. Bassett gives new meaning to the words "girl power" and Fiennes somehow makes his sleazoid character likable and sad. The support from Tom Sizemore, Vincent D'Onofrio et al. is tremendous. Great action from two masters - recommended.

    Strange Days is a very interesting and enjoyable cyber-punk-esque, end-of-the-millennium detective film. Set about four years after it was released (1995, i believe) its world is a close future in which Los Angeles is being torn apart by race riots and police brutality - all washed down with a hedonistic population clamouring for new sensations. Here we find the science-ficiton device. The "SQUID" prosthesis which allows peoples experiences to be recorded, reproduced and sold on the black market for people to experience for themselves. The story follows Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) into an intriguing and disturbing detective story centring on a murder recorded by one of these devices. Not only does the film flesh itself out with violence, car chases, and a pretty massive party but, through its use of the SQUID device, it allows for a good detective story to ask interesting questions about bodily experience - and the nature of that when it becomes recordable (turned into information) and sellable - when it becomes currency. So where is there fault with this film? (7*?) Well there isn't much really. At times the film's 'bad guy' seems to become that 90s villain we've seen so many times. And I think the plot-twist and the ending were both rather forced(but this is pretty big-budget stuff, so...). I could go on and list things which I think could have been better about the film but that would be not only useless but arrogant. This is a great film which, despite falling into a few of the usual traps, deals with some interesting themes and is very enjoyable to watch (and has some alright music in it too) - This is a film of its time which is defiantly worth watching.

    I had no idea this film even existed until it showed up in my Netflix 'recommended' column, and I decided to give it a shot after reading some good reviews on there. Wow, am I happy I did. This was a truly fantastic sci-fi thriller, with intense action and a truly engaging story. The characters were very well constructed and had a lot of substance to them, and of course the acting was superb. Who knew Ralph Finnes could play such a good lowlife? Set in an alternate (but totally recognizable) Los Angeles of 1999, the world has seemingly gone completely to hell, due to rampant poverty and class/racial tensions which are pushing society towards an all-out state of anarchy. The authorities are barely maintaining order, despite resorting to draconian measures to try and keep things in check. The director does an excellent job of painting this picture for us through fantastic environment and background shots which effectively build the tension and make us fully believe what is happening. In this world, they have invented a type of virtual reality which allows an individual to record everything they are seeing and feeling directly through their brain, so as to then be played back later through someone else's brain, which allows the user to then see and feel exactly what was recorded without any danger (other than possible addiction). So needless to say a huge black market has sprung up to provide people with recordings of all kinds of illicit, criminal and sexual activities that they'd never actually get to experience in the real world. The plot of the movie builds from this technology. However, other than this particular device and general state of social affairs, the alternate 1999 is pretty much identical to our 1999 (very much to it's credit). No flying cars, no wacky fashion, no aliens, no laser guns or anything like that. It was a great decision by the filmmakers to not bite off more than they could chew in that regard, as it would have distracted from a very solid story. The films weaknesses are few, but are there nonetheless. It was a bit long... although I'm not usually one to complain about that kind of thing, so long as the time is necessary to tell the story. In this case an argument can be made either way, though I personally feel they could have lost about fifteen minutes or so (but to me it's a minor issue). The director also felt the need to very quickly explain the origin of the virtual reality technology through a throwaway line of dialog, which really added nothing to the plot, and honestly made no sense; they said the technology was originally developed for the FBI so that informants wouldn't have to wear a wire, which is just dumb. The device is WAY more cumbersome and easily discoverable than a wire transmitter. How about saying that the military invented it to train soldiers more realistically? Or just leave it alone... true virtual reality is a technological holy grail. I don't think anyone questions why something like that would be invented in the first place, even if it's purely for entertainment. Additionally, in my opinion, a couple of the 'bad guys' could have had their motivations fleshed out a tad better, but that is a also very minor quibble. Beyond that, the look of the movie is quite dated, which could hinder the enjoyment for some people. The 1990's did not age very well to our eyes, and this movie is VERY much a product of that era. If you lived through it, you know what I mean. Younger viewers may not fully get the social and cultural allusions that this movie is built upon (Rodney King riots, 90's hip hop culture, rave clubs... things like that)... just something to keep in mind, although if you did live though it, you'll appreciate the depth that these references add. But really, I can't recommend this film highly enough. It's a completely under-appreciated piece of work, and one of the best sci-fi thrillers out there.

    A seemingly forgotten piece of Cyberpunk that traded heavily on pre-millennium hysteria, I hadn't seen 'Strange Days' since it was released. I certainly remember liking it... well, respecting it would be more accurate. I thought it was well made, but it wasn't the type of film I was itching to watch again any time soon. Fast forward nearly 20 years, and I got the itch again. My reaction now is pretty much the same as it was then. It's very well made (Directed by Kathryn Bigelow and co-written by then husband James Cameron). The cast is strong as well. Generally I find Ralph Fiennes a bore, but he's great here, showing more personality and life than I've ever seen from him before. Culturally it's a bit dated, but overall it holds up quite well. Not sure why this one seems to have slipped through the cracks. It's a very solid sci-fi thriller.

    This is a movie with so much potential but never really quite lives up to it. It's a great film which could have been the Blade Runner of its' time but just didn't quite make it. A fabulous performance from Ralph Fiennes, playing so much against type but succeeding brilliantly, even his American accent is convincing (at least to my British ears). Angela Bassett is simply a revelation, her amazing Mace a long way from her Tina Turner. Great supporting cast too especially from Tom Sizemore and William Fichtner as two police officers who suddenly find themselves in way over their heads. It is quite simply far too long, you could have cut out nearly all of the nightclub sequences and not lost anything. Of course we all know that the millennium turned out to be not anything like as it is depicted but in the post Rodney King era this didn't seem that far fetched. I simply cannot watch the scene where Iris is murdered in the bathtub, it is so horrible it beggars belief. You would say that this is a misogynist film if it wasn't written and directed by woman. It's hard to keep track of the plot but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Great central concept, wouldn't it be fantastic to be able to experience other peoples memories? The blazing limo scene is just terrific and Lenny is a surprisingly likable hero for such a dirtbag hustler (not least for the scene where he gives his friend in the wheelchair a clip of jogging along the beach). Laughed out loud at the sequence where he goes to confront the burglar in his flat only to realise he forgot to load his gun. Love, love, love the ending, the final kiss and embrace what we've all been rooting for all along. Adore the image of the hippy girl kissing the National Guardsman on top of the tank, just so beautiful, much like the LAPD coming good at the end showing humanity can prevail against all odds. And Mace and Lenny can get together and live happily ever after. Great music as well (the nightclub numbers aside) and adore Juliette Lewis character telling Lenny it's over, just pipping Mace reminding him that memories are meant to fade. A marvellous film that really deserved to do better at the box office.

    This 1995 movie takes place on December 30 and 31 1999. It's about a hustler named Lenny (Ralph Fiennes) who sells dreams (so to speak). You put on a device that covers the top of your head, insert a disc and it plays an experience that someone else had...but you see it through their eyes and hear it too. It's like a drug...very addictive. Then a friend of his is brutally murdered for a disc that has incriminating evidence against the LAPD that could lead to a war. Soon Lenny and ex-girlfriend Lornette (Angela Bassett) are running for their lives from people who will kill them for the disc. The plot is kind of hard to describe but the movie is fascinating. I first saw it up a theatre in stereo on a large screen and it blew me away. The imagery is incredible (excellent direction by Kathryn Bigelow) and the sound mix inventive. The movie isn't easy to watch at times--there's a VERY graphic sequence where a woman is tortured, raped and murdered--but it is needed for the plot. The plot is involved but I was never confused. The acting is, for the most part, great. Fiennes is great and Bassett is just incredible. They're both great actors and give their all to this. Tom Sizemore has a small role and he's pretty good. However Juliette Lewis is terrible as an ex of Lenny. Very wooden. The only real bad thing is the climax--it goes on for far too long (this movie doesn't have to run 145 minutes). This was lost back in 1995 and didn't even become known when director Bigelow won an Oscar for "The Hurt Locker"--but it deserves recognition. Well worth seeing.

    Strange Days is a very interesting and enjoyable cyber-punk-esque, end-of-the-millennium detective film. Set about four years after it was released (1995, i believe) its world is a close future in which Los Angeles is being torn apart by race riots and police brutality - all washed down with a hedonistic population clamouring for new sensations. Here we find the science-ficiton device. The "SQUID" prosthesis which allows peoples experiences to be recorded, reproduced and sold on the black market for people to experience for themselves. The story follows Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) into an intriguing and disturbing detective story centring on a murder recorded by one of these devices. Not only does the film flesh itself out with violence, car chases, and a pretty massive party but, through its use of the SQUID device, it allows for a good detective story to ask interesting questions about bodily experience - and the nature of that when it becomes recordable (turned into information) and sellable - when it becomes currency. So where is there fault with this film? (7*?) Well there isn't much really. At times the film's 'bad guy' seems to become that 90s villain we've seen so many times. And I think the plot-twist and the ending were both rather forced(but this is pretty big-budget stuff, so...). I could go on and list things which I think could have been better about the film but that would be not only useless but arrogant. This is a great film which, despite falling into a few of the usual traps, deals with some interesting themes and is very enjoyable to watch (and has some alright music in it too) - This is a film of its time which is defiantly worth watching.

Beyond that, the look of the movie is quite dated, which could hinder the enjoyment for some people. The 1990's did not age very well to our eyes, and this movie is VERY much a product of that era. If you lived through it, you know what I mean. Younger viewers may not fully get the social and cultural allusions that this movie is built upon (Rodney King riots, 90's hip hop culture, rave clubs... things like that)... just something to keep in mind, although if you did live though it, you'll appreciate the depth that these references add. But really, I can't recommend this film highly enough. It's a completely under-appreciated piece of work, and one of the best sci-fi thrillers out there.

    A seemingly forgotten piece of Cyberpunk that traded heavily on pre-millennium hysteria, I hadn't seen 'Strange Days' since it was released. I certainly remember liking it... well, respecting it would be more accurate. I thought it was well made, but it wasn't the type of film I was itching to watch again any time soon. Fast forward nearly 20 years, and I got the itch again. My reaction now is pretty much the same as it was then. It's very well made (Directed by Kathryn Bigelow and co-written by then husband James Cameron). The cast is strong as well. Generally I find Ralph Fiennes a bore, but he's great here, showing more personality and life than I've ever seen from him before. Culturally it's a bit dated, but overall it holds up quite well. Not sure why this one seems to have slipped through the cracks. It's a very solid sci-fi thriller.

    This is a movie with so much potential but never really quite lives up to it. It's a great film which could have been the Blade Runner of its' time but just didn't quite make it. A fabulous performance from Ralph Fiennes, playing so much against type but succeeding brilliantly, even his American accent is convincing (at least to my British ears). Angela Bassett is simply a revelation, her amazing Mace a long way from her Tina Turner. Great supporting cast too especially from Tom Sizemore and William Fichtner as two police officers who suddenly find themselves in way over their heads. It is quite simply far too long, you could have cut out nearly all of the nightclub sequences and not lost anything. Of course we all know that the millennium turned out to be not anything like as it is depicted but in the post Rodney King era this didn't seem that far fetched. I simply cannot watch the scene where Iris is murdered in the bathtub, it is so horrible it beggars belief. You would say that this is a misogynist film if it wasn't written and directed by woman. It's hard to keep track of the plot but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Great central concept, wouldn't it be fantastic to be able to experience other peoples memories? The blazing limo scene is just terrific and Lenny is a surprisingly likable hero for such a dirtbag hustler (not least for the scene where he gives his friend in the wheelchair a clip of jogging along the beach). Laughed out loud at the sequence where he goes to confront the burglar in his flat only to realise he forgot to load his gun. Love, love, love the ending, the final kiss and embrace what we've all been rooting for all along. Adore the image of the hippy girl kissing the National Guardsman on top of the tank, just so beautiful, much like the LAPD coming good at the end showing humanity can prevail against all odds. And Mace and Lenny can get together and live happily ever after. Great music as well (the nightclub numbers aside) and adore Juliette Lewis character telling Lenny it's over, just pipping Mace reminding him that memories are meant to fade. A marvellous film that really deserved to do better at the box office.

    This 1995 movie takes place on December 30 and 31 1999. It's about a hustler named Lenny (Ralph Fiennes) who sells dreams (so to speak). You put on a device that covers the top of your head, insert a disc and it plays an experience that someone else had...but you see it through their eyes and hear it too. It's like a drug...very addictive. Then a friend of his is brutally murdered for a disc that has incriminating evidence against the LAPD that could lead to a war. Soon Lenny and ex-girlfriend Lornette (Angela Bassett) are running for their lives from people who will kill them for the disc. The plot is kind of hard to describe but the movie is fascinating. I first saw it up a theatre in stereo on a large screen and it blew me away. The imagery is incredible (excellent direction by Kathryn Bigelow) and the sound mix inventive. The movie isn't easy to watch at times--there's a VERY graphic sequence where a woman is tortured, raped and murdered--but it is needed for the plot. The plot is involved but I was never confused. The acting is, for the most part, great. Fiennes is great and Bassett is just incredible. They're both great actors and give their all to this. Tom Sizemore has a small role and he's pretty good. However Juliette Lewis is terrible as an ex of Lenny. Very wooden. The only real bad thing is the climax--it goes on for far too long (this movie doesn't have to run 145 minutes). This was lost back in 1995 and didn't even become known when director Bigelow won an Oscar for "The Hurt Locker"--but it deserves recognition. Well worth seeing.

    Despite the fact that this review is being written approximately 17 years after the release of Strange Days, I can't seem to shake the feeling that Kathryn Bigelow and James Cameron's dystopian drama about selling memories on the black market has a clear vision of the future not just of LA but of the United States. Police brutality, anarchic riots and a nihilistic atmosphere all contribute to the dark and edgy tone of the film which begins so brilliantly that it would be hard- pressed to maintain such a high order. Unfortunately, that is the case. The opening sequence is shot from entirely one character's POV as hand-held cameras swirl around freely, taking in all the action with such rabid voyeurism that it would suck almost anyone into watching intently. What follows is a film with some impressive questions and issues to raise but ultimately sifts them through a mostly standard action plot involving numerous beatings, chase sequences and even a few scenes of rape. Needless to say, these plot devices are not entirely necessary to explore these ideas but Bigelow makes it work for the most part, using every camera and editing trick in her arsenal. The screenplay, co- written by James Cameron, has his usual breathless action scenes as well as tight pacing that takes us right up to a number of stunning conclusions that by the very end topple over one another. Perhaps it is a bit too ambitious, but this film does deserve to be called the "Blade Runner of the 1990s" and boasts some very fine performances, not the least of which belongs to the amazingly versatile Ralph Fiennes. All in all, this is an action film worth checking out if only for the incredible techniques implemented to fulfill its vision. The problem lies within the vision, which is overstuffed and at times difficult to entirely comprehend.

    In a futuristic world, black market virtual reality is all the rage. Ex-Cop Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is the guy you go to for all your virtual dreams. He can get you anything from the ultimate vacation to porno and everything in between. Nero's world is soon to be turned upside when on the eve of the millennium, he receives a tape which contains the murder of someone he knows. Many people don't know this, but Strange Days was actually written by famed Director, James Cameron, shortly before he did Titanic, a stark contrast from one project to the other. The mystery of Strange Days, as well as the machine, are cool as hell. What's not is how it ended, because once you find out who and why, you can pretty much figure out the rest, making the last half hour of the film unnecessary. Fiennes is the star and does a pretty good job, but the one who really impressed me was Angela Bassett. She plays his bad ass partner, Mace, and she was really something to see. Strange days is something different in many ways, but it's also predictable, repetitive, and anti-climactic in others. It's a cool film and a different story, but most of the acting is weak, and the story repeats itself leading up to its predictable ending.

    if you like nudity and violence, then this may be the movie for you. otherwise, you'll probably find it a waste of time, and maybe even offensive. personally, i find nudity and violence hackneyed. the acting was pretty bad. i mean, there were a lot of people in the movie. so if a fifth of them did a terrible job, then it shows. the plot was wanting also. the whole world isn't in some drug and alcohol induced riot. people just don't behave this way. then, if they did, there's the national guard. and martial law. where was that ? it just didn't cut it for me, and a poor choice in case you were watching it with a date. my recommendation for a strange off-the-wall movie: requiem for a dream.

    This is not a good movie. It felt like there was a good story buried here somewhere, like the movie had been poorly adapted from a Philip Dick novel. But this movie starts out mediocre, gets worse, and by the end is a laugher. The dialogue, characters, and plot are cheesy and clich&eacute;d. It's directed and shot like TV movie. The racial and gender themes are tacked on, do not feel authentic, and are never seriously addressed. The "surprise" was not particularly surprising. And on top of all that, it is long: almost 2 and a half hours. Ralph Fiennes is just about always watchable, and Juliette Lewis is topless several times. Other than that, there's very little to recommend here.

    Kathryn Bigelow directs a story and screenplay by James Cameron called "Strange Days." Made in 1995, the film is set in dark, chaotic 1999 as it heads toward 2000. Many feel 2000 will mark the end of the world - sound familiar? - but as we now know, 9/11 hadn't happened yet, and the date of the Rapture has been moved yet again. Ralph Fiennes is Lenny Nero, an ex-cop turned bootlegger dealing in illegal "squid" recordings - virtual-reality type tapes actually made from the cerebral cortex so that the viewer experiences true emotions as if the viewer were actually there. Lenny depends on a friend, Mace (Angela Bassett) while he still loves his ex-girlfriend, a singer named Faith (Juliette Lewis). A prostitute, Iris (Brigitte Bako) doing recordings for Lenny records something that soon gets Iris savagely murdered and Lenny and Mace running for their lives. There are some spectacular scenes. The best one (as far as I'm concerned) is with Lenny and Mace in Mace's car while they're being shot at and then set on fire. Don't miss it! Both Fiennes and Bassett are fantastic, and it would be hard to say which one is better. Bassett gives new meaning to the words "girl power" and Fiennes somehow makes his sleazoid character likable and sad. The support from Tom Sizemore, Vincent D'Onofrio et al. is tremendous. Great action from two masters - recommended.

    Strange Days is a very interesting and enjoyable cyber-punk-esque, end-of-the-millennium detective film. Set about four years after it was released (1995, i believe) its world is a close future in which Los Angeles is being torn apart by race riots and police brutality - all washed down with a hedonistic population clamouring for new sensations. Here we find the science-ficiton device. The "SQUID" prosthesis which allows peoples experiences to be recorded, reproduced and sold on the black market for people to experience for themselves. The story follows Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) into an intriguing and disturbing detective story centring on a murder recorded by one of these devices. Not only does the film flesh itself out with violence, car chases, and a pretty massive party but, through its use of the SQUID device, it allows for a good detective story to ask interesting questions about bodily experience - and the nature of that when it becomes recordable (turned into information) and sellable - when it becomes currency. So where is there fault with this film? (7*?) Well there isn't much really. At times the film's 'bad guy' seems to become that 90s villain we've seen so many times. And I think the plot-twist and the ending were both rather forced(but this is pretty big-budget stuff, so...). I could go on and list things which I think could have been better about the film but that would be not only useless but arrogant. This is a great film which, despite falling into a few of the usual traps, deals with some interesting themes and is very enjoyable to watch (and has some alright music in it too) - This is a film of its time which is defiantly worth watching.

    I had no idea this film even existed until it showed up in my Netflix 'recommended' column, and I decided to give it a shot after reading some good reviews on there. Wow, am I happy I did. This was a truly fantastic sci-fi thriller, with intense action and a truly engaging story. The characters were very well constructed and had a lot of substance to them, and of course the acting was superb. Who knew Ralph Finnes could play such a good lowlife? Set in an alternate (but totally recognizable) Los Angeles of 1999, the world has seemingly gone completely to hell, due to rampant poverty and class/racial tensions which are pushing society towards an all-out state of anarchy. The authorities are barely maintaining order, despite resorting to draconian measures to try and keep things in check. The director does an excellent job of painting this picture for us through fantastic environment and background shots which effectively build the tension and make us fully believe what is happening. In this world, they have invented a type of virtual reality which allows an individual to record everything they are seeing and feeling directly through their brain, so as to then be played back later through someone else's brain, which allows the user to then see and feel exactly what was recorded without any danger (other than possible addiction). So needless to say a huge black market has sprung up to provide people with recordings of all kinds of illicit, criminal and sexual activities that they'd never actually get to experience in the real world. The plot of the movie builds from this technology. However, other than this particular device and general state of social affairs, the alternate 1999 is pretty much identical to our 1999 (very much to it's credit). No flying cars, no wacky fashion, no aliens, no laser guns or anything like that. It was a great decision by the filmmakers to not bite off more than they could chew in that regard, as it would have distracted from a very solid story. The films weaknesses are few, but are there nonetheless. It was a bit long... although I'm not usually one to complain about that kind of thing, so long as the time is necessary to tell the story. In this case an argument can be made either way, though I personally feel they could have lost about fifteen minutes or so (but to me it's a minor issue). The director also felt the need to very quickly explain the origin of the virtual reality technology through a throwaway line of dialog, which really added nothing to the plot, and honestly made no sense; they said the technology was originally developed for the FBI so that informants wouldn't have to wear a wire, which is just dumb. The device is WAY more cumbersome and easily discoverable than a wire transmitter. How about saying that the military invented it to train soldiers more realistically? Or just leave it alone... true virtual reality is a technological holy grail. I don't think anyone questions why something like that would be invented in the first place, even if it's purely for entertainment. Additionally, in my opinion, a couple of the 'bad guys' could have had their motivations fleshed out a tad better, but that is a also very minor quibble. Beyond that, the look of the movie is quite dated, which could hinder the enjoyment for some people. The 1990's did not age very well to our eyes, and this movie is VERY much a product of that era. If you lived through it, you know what I mean. Younger viewers may not fully get the social and cultural allusions that this movie is built upon (Rodney King riots, 90's hip hop culture, rave clubs... things like that)... just something to keep in mind, although if you did live though it, you'll appreciate the depth that these references add. But really, I can't recommend this film highly enough. It's a completely under-appreciated piece of work, and one of the best sci-fi thrillers out there.

Lenny depends on a friend, Mace (Angela Bassett) while he still loves his ex-girlfriend, a singer named Faith (Juliette Lewis). A prostitute, Iris (Brigitte Bako) doing recordings for Lenny records something that soon gets Iris savagely murdered and Lenny and Mace running for their lives. There are some spectacular scenes. The best one (as far as I'm concerned) is with Lenny and Mace in Mace's car while they're being shot at and then set on fire. Don't miss it! Both Fiennes and Bassett are fantastic, and it would be hard to say which one is better. Bassett gives new meaning to the words "girl power" and Fiennes somehow makes his sleazoid character likable and sad. The support from Tom Sizemore, Vincent D'Onofrio et al. is tremendous. Great action from two masters - recommended.

    Strange Days is a very interesting and enjoyable cyber-punk-esque, end-of-the-millennium detective film. Set about four years after it was released (1995, i believe) its world is a close future in which Los Angeles is being torn apart by race riots and police brutality - all washed down with a hedonistic population clamouring for new sensations. Here we find the science-ficiton device. The "SQUID" prosthesis which allows peoples experiences to be recorded, reproduced and sold on the black market for people to experience for themselves. The story follows Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) into an intriguing and disturbing detective story centring on a murder recorded by one of these devices. Not only does the film flesh itself out with violence, car chases, and a pretty massive party but, through its use of the SQUID device, it allows for a good detective story to ask interesting questions about bodily experience - and the nature of that when it becomes recordable (turned into information) and sellable - when it becomes currency. So where is there fault with this film? (7*?) Well there isn't much really. At times the film's 'bad guy' seems to become that 90s villain we've seen so many times. And I think the plot-twist and the ending were both rather forced(but this is pretty big-budget stuff, so...). I could go on and list things which I think could have been better about the film but that would be not only useless but arrogant. This is a great film which, despite falling into a few of the usual traps, deals with some interesting themes and is very enjoyable to watch (and has some alright music in it too) - This is a film of its time which is defiantly worth watching.

    I had no idea this film even existed until it showed up in my Netflix 'recommended' column, and I decided to give it a shot after reading some good reviews on there. Wow, am I happy I did. This was a truly fantastic sci-fi thriller, with intense action and a truly engaging story. The characters were very well constructed and had a lot of substance to them, and of course the acting was superb. Who knew Ralph Finnes could play such a good lowlife? Set in an alternate (but totally recognizable) Los Angeles of 1999, the world has seemingly gone completely to hell, due to rampant poverty and class/racial tensions which are pushing society towards an all-out state of anarchy. The authorities are barely maintaining order, despite resorting to draconian measures to try and keep things in check. The director does an excellent job of painting this picture for us through fantastic environment and background shots which effectively build the tension and make us fully believe what is happening. In this world, they have invented a type of virtual reality which allows an individual to record everything they are seeing and feeling directly through their brain, so as to then be played back later through someone else's brain, which allows the user to then see and feel exactly what was recorded without any danger (other than possible addiction). So needless to say a huge black market has sprung up to provide people with recordings of all kinds of illicit, criminal and sexual activities that they'd never actually get to experience in the real world. The plot of the movie builds from this technology. However, other than this particular device and general state of social affairs, the alternate 1999 is pretty much identical to our 1999 (very much to it's credit). No flying cars, no wacky fashion, no aliens, no laser guns or anything like that. It was a great decision by the filmmakers to not bite off more than they could chew in that regard, as it would have distracted from a very solid story. The films weaknesses are few, but are there nonetheless. It was a bit long... although I'm not usually one to complain about that kind of thing, so long as the time is necessary to tell the story. In this case an argument can be made either way, though I personally feel they could have lost about fifteen minutes or so (but to me it's a minor issue). The director also felt the need to very quickly explain the origin of the virtual reality technology through a throwaway line of dialog, which really added nothing to the plot, and honestly made no sense; they said the technology was originally developed for the FBI so that informants wouldn't have to wear a wire, which is just dumb. The device is WAY more cumbersome and easily discoverable than a wire transmitter. How about saying that the military invented it to train soldiers more realistically? Or just leave it alone... true virtual reality is a technological holy grail. I don't think anyone questions why something like that would be invented in the first place, even if it's purely for entertainment. Additionally, in my opinion, a couple of the 'bad guys' could have had their motivations fleshed out a tad better, but that is a also very minor quibble. Beyond that, the look of the movie is quite dated, which could hinder the enjoyment for some people. The 1990's did not age very well to our eyes, and this movie is VERY much a product of that era. If you lived through it, you know what I mean. Younger viewers may not fully get the social and cultural allusions that this movie is built upon (Rodney King riots, 90's hip hop culture, rave clubs... things like that)... just something to keep in mind, although if you did live though it, you'll appreciate the depth that these references add. But really, I can't recommend this film highly enough. It's a completely under-appreciated piece of work, and one of the best sci-fi thrillers out there.

    A seemingly forgotten piece of Cyberpunk that traded heavily on pre-millennium hysteria, I hadn't seen 'Strange Days' since it was released. I certainly remember liking it... well, respecting it would be more accurate. I thought it was well made, but it wasn't the type of film I was itching to watch again any time soon. Fast forward nearly 20 years, and I got the itch again. My reaction now is pretty much the same as it was then. It's very well made (Directed by Kathryn Bigelow and co-written by then husband James Cameron). The cast is strong as well. Generally I find Ralph Fiennes a bore, but he's great here, showing more personality and life than I've ever seen from him before. Culturally it's a bit dated, but overall it holds up quite well. Not sure why this one seems to have slipped through the cracks. It's a very solid sci-fi thriller.

    This is a movie with so much potential but never really quite lives up to it. It's a great film which could have been the Blade Runner of its' time but just didn't quite make it. A fabulous performance from Ralph Fiennes, playing so much against type but succeeding brilliantly, even his American accent is convincing (at least to my British ears). Angela Bassett is simply a revelation, her amazing Mace a long way from her Tina Turner. Great supporting cast too especially from Tom Sizemore and William Fichtner as two police officers who suddenly find themselves in way over their heads. It is quite simply far too long, you could have cut out nearly all of the nightclub sequences and not lost anything. Of course we all know that the millennium turned out to be not anything like as it is depicted but in the post Rodney King era this didn't seem that far fetched. I simply cannot watch the scene where Iris is murdered in the bathtub, it is so horrible it beggars belief. You would say that this is a misogynist film if it wasn't written and directed by woman. It's hard to keep track of the plot but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Great central concept, wouldn't it be fantastic to be able to experience other peoples memories? The blazing limo scene is just terrific and Lenny is a surprisingly likable hero for such a dirtbag hustler (not least for the scene where he gives his friend in the wheelchair a clip of jogging along the beach). Laughed out loud at the sequence where he goes to confront the burglar in his flat only to realise he forgot to load his gun. Love, love, love the ending, the final kiss and embrace what we've all been rooting for all along. Adore the image of the hippy girl kissing the National Guardsman on top of the tank, just so beautiful, much like the LAPD coming good at the end showing humanity can prevail against all odds. And Mace and Lenny can get together and live happily ever after. Great music as well (the nightclub numbers aside) and adore Juliette Lewis character telling Lenny it's over, just pipping Mace reminding him that memories are meant to fade. A marvellous film that really deserved to do better at the box office.

    This 1995 movie takes place on December 30 and 31 1999. It's about a hustler named Lenny (Ralph Fiennes) who sells dreams (so to speak). You put on a device that covers the top of your head, insert a disc and it plays an experience that someone else had...but you see it through their eyes and hear it too. It's like a drug...very addictive. Then a friend of his is brutally murdered for a disc that has incriminating evidence against the LAPD that could lead to a war. Soon Lenny and ex-girlfriend Lornette (Angela Bassett) are running for their lives from people who will kill them for the disc. The plot is kind of hard to describe but the movie is fascinating. I first saw it up a theatre in stereo on a large screen and it blew me away. The imagery is incredible (excellent direction by Kathryn Bigelow) and the sound mix inventive. The movie isn't easy to watch at times--there's a VERY graphic sequence where a woman is tortured, raped and murdered--but it is needed for the plot. The plot is involved but I was never confused. The acting is, for the most part, great. Fiennes is great and Bassett is just incredible. They're both great actors and give their all to this. Tom Sizemore has a small role and he's pretty good. However Juliette Lewis is terrible as an ex of Lenny. Very wooden. The only real bad thing is the climax--it goes on for far too long (this movie doesn't have to run 145 minutes). This was lost back in 1995 and didn't even become known when director Bigelow won an Oscar for "The Hurt Locker"--but it deserves recognition. Well worth seeing.

    Despite the fact that this review is being written approximately 17 years after the release of Strange Days, I can't seem to shake the feeling that Kathryn Bigelow and James Cameron's dystopian drama about selling memories on the black market has a clear vision of the future not just of LA but of the United States. Police brutality, anarchic riots and a nihilistic atmosphere all contribute to the dark and edgy tone of the film which begins so brilliantly that it would be hard- pressed to maintain such a high order. Unfortunately, that is the case. The opening sequence is shot from entirely one character's POV as hand-held cameras swirl around freely, taking in all the action with such rabid voyeurism that it would suck almost anyone into watching intently. What follows is a film with some impressive questions and issues to raise but ultimately sifts them through a mostly standard action plot involving numerous beatings, chase sequences and even a few scenes of rape. Needless to say, these plot devices are not entirely necessary to explore these ideas but Bigelow makes it work for the most part, using every camera and editing trick in her arsenal. The screenplay, co- written by James Cameron, has his usual breathless action scenes as well as tight pacing that takes us right up to a number of stunning conclusions that by the very end topple over one another. Perhaps it is a bit too ambitious, but this film does deserve to be called the "Blade Runner of the 1990s" and boasts some very fine performances, not the least of which belongs to the amazingly versatile Ralph Fiennes. All in all, this is an action film worth checking out if only for the incredible techniques implemented to fulfill its vision. The problem lies within the vision, which is overstuffed and at times difficult to entirely comprehend.

    In a futuristic world, black market virtual reality is all the rage. Ex-Cop Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is the guy you go to for all your virtual dreams. He can get you anything from the ultimate vacation to porno and everything in between. Nero's world is soon to be turned upside when on the eve of the millennium, he receives a tape which contains the murder of someone he knows. Many people don't know this, but Strange Days was actually written by famed Director, James Cameron, shortly before he did Titanic, a stark contrast from one project to the other. The mystery of Strange Days, as well as the machine, are cool as hell. What's not is how it ended, because once you find out who and why, you can pretty much figure out the rest, making the last half hour of the film unnecessary. Fiennes is the star and does a pretty good job, but the one who really impressed me was Angela Bassett. She plays his bad ass partner, Mace, and she was really something to see. Strange days is something different in many ways, but it's also predictable, repetitive, and anti-climactic in others. It's a cool film and a different story, but most of the acting is weak, and the story repeats itself leading up to its predictable ending.

    if you like nudity and violence, then this may be the movie for you. otherwise, you'll probably find it a waste of time, and maybe even offensive. personally, i find nudity and violence hackneyed. the acting was pretty bad. i mean, there were a lot of people in the movie. so if a fifth of them did a terrible job, then it shows. the plot was wanting also. the whole world isn't in some drug and alcohol induced riot. people just don't behave this way. then, if they did, there's the national guard. and martial law. where was that ? it just didn't cut it for me, and a poor choice in case you were watching it with a date. my recommendation for a strange off-the-wall movie: requiem for a dream.

    This is not a good movie. It felt like there was a good story buried here somewhere, like the movie had been poorly adapted from a Philip Dick novel. But this movie starts out mediocre, gets worse, and by the end is a laugher. The dialogue, characters, and plot are cheesy and clich&eacute;d. It's directed and shot like TV movie. The racial and gender themes are tacked on, do not feel authentic, and are never seriously addressed. The "surprise" was not particularly surprising. And on top of all that, it is long: almost 2 and a half hours. Ralph Fiennes is just about always watchable, and Juliette Lewis is topless several times. Other than that, there's very little to recommend here.

    Kathryn Bigelow directs a story and screenplay by James Cameron called "Strange Days." Made in 1995, the film is set in dark, chaotic 1999 as it heads toward 2000. Many feel 2000 will mark the end of the world - sound familiar? - but as we now know, 9/11 hadn't happened yet, and the date of the Rapture has been moved yet again. Ralph Fiennes is Lenny Nero, an ex-cop turned bootlegger dealing in illegal "squid" recordings - virtual-reality type tapes actually made from the cerebral cortex so that the viewer experiences true emotions as if the viewer were actually there. Lenny depends on a friend, Mace (Angela Bassett) while he still loves his ex-girlfriend, a singer named Faith (Juliette Lewis). A prostitute, Iris (Brigitte Bako) doing recordings for Lenny records something that soon gets Iris savagely murdered and Lenny and Mace running for their lives. There are some spectacular scenes. The best one (as far as I'm concerned) is with Lenny and Mace in Mace's car while they're being shot at and then set on fire. Don't miss it! Both Fiennes and Bassett are fantastic, and it would be hard to say which one is better. Bassett gives new meaning to the words "girl power" and Fiennes somehow makes his sleazoid character likable and sad. The support from Tom Sizemore, Vincent D'Onofrio et al. is tremendous. Great action from two masters - recommended.

    Strange Days is a very interesting and enjoyable cyber-punk-esque, end-of-the-millennium detective film. Set about four years after it was released (1995, i believe) its world is a close future in which Los Angeles is being torn apart by race riots and police brutality - all washed down with a hedonistic population clamouring for new sensations. Here we find the science-ficiton device. The "SQUID" prosthesis which allows peoples experiences to be recorded, reproduced and sold on the black market for people to experience for themselves. The story follows Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) into an intriguing and disturbing detective story centring on a murder recorded by one of these devices. Not only does the film flesh itself out with violence, car chases, and a pretty massive party but, through its use of the SQUID device, it allows for a good detective story to ask interesting questions about bodily experience - and the nature of that when it becomes recordable (turned into information) and sellable - when it becomes currency. So where is there fault with this film? (7*?) Well there isn't much really. At times the film's 'bad guy' seems to become that 90s villain we've seen so many times. And I think the plot-twist and the ending were both rather forced(but this is pretty big-budget stuff, so...). I could go on and list things which I think could have been better about the film but that would be not only useless but arrogant. This is a great film which, despite falling into a few of the usual traps, deals with some interesting themes and is very enjoyable to watch (and has some alright music in it too) - This is a film of its time which is defiantly worth watching.

    This 1995 movie takes place on December 30 and 31 1999. It's about a hustler named Lenny (Ralph Fiennes) who sells dreams (so to speak). You put on a device that covers the top of your head, insert a disc and it plays an experience that someone else had...but you see it through their eyes and hear it too. It's like a drug...very addictive. Then a friend of his is brutally murdered for a disc that has incriminating evidence against the LAPD that could lead to a war. Soon Lenny and ex-girlfriend Lornette (Angela Bassett) are running for their lives from people who will kill them for the disc. The plot is kind of hard to describe but the movie is fascinating.

However Juliette Lewis is terrible as an ex of Lenny. Very wooden. The only real bad thing is the climax--it goes on for far too long (this movie doesn't have to run 145 minutes). This was lost back in 1995 and didn't even become known when director Bigelow won an Oscar for "The Hurt Locker"--but it deserves recognition. Well worth seeing.

    Despite the fact that this review is being written approximately 17 years after the release of Strange Days, I can't seem to shake the feeling that Kathryn Bigelow and James Cameron's dystopian drama about selling memories on the black market has a clear vision of the future not just of LA but of the United States. Police brutality, anarchic riots and a nihilistic atmosphere all contribute to the dark and edgy tone of the film which begins so brilliantly that it would be hard- pressed to maintain such a high order. Unfortunately, that is the case. The opening sequence is shot from entirely one character's POV as hand-held cameras swirl around freely, taking in all the action with such rabid voyeurism that it would suck almost anyone into watching intently. What follows is a film with some impressive questions and issues to raise but ultimately sifts them through a mostly standard action plot involving numerous beatings, chase sequences and even a few scenes of rape. Needless to say, these plot devices are not entirely necessary to explore these ideas but Bigelow makes it work for the most part, using every camera and editing trick in her arsenal. The screenplay, co- written by James Cameron, has his usual breathless action scenes as well as tight pacing that takes us right up to a number of stunning conclusions that by the very end topple over one another. Perhaps it is a bit too ambitious, but this film does deserve to be called the "Blade Runner of the 1990s" and boasts some very fine performances, not the least of which belongs to the amazingly versatile Ralph Fiennes. All in all, this is an action film worth checking out if only for the incredible techniques implemented to fulfill its vision. The problem lies within the vision, which is overstuffed and at times difficult to entirely comprehend.

    In a futuristic world, black market virtual reality is all the rage. Ex-Cop Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is the guy you go to for all your virtual dreams. He can get you anything from the ultimate vacation to porno and everything in between. Nero's world is soon to be turned upside when on the eve of the millennium, he receives a tape which contains the murder of someone he knows. Many people don't know this, but Strange Days was actually written by famed Director, James Cameron, shortly before he did Titanic, a stark contrast from one project to the other. The mystery of Strange Days, as well as the machine, are cool as hell. What's not is how it ended, because once you find out who and why, you can pretty much figure out the rest, making the last half hour of the film unnecessary. Fiennes is the star and does a pretty good job, but the one who really impressed me was Angela Bassett. She plays his bad ass partner, Mace, and she was really something to see. Strange days is something different in many ways, but it's also predictable, repetitive, and anti-climactic in others. It's a cool film and a different story, but most of the acting is weak, and the story repeats itself leading up to its predictable ending.

    if you like nudity and violence, then this may be the movie for you. otherwise, you'll probably find it a waste of time, and maybe even offensive. personally, i find nudity and violence hackneyed. the acting was pretty bad. i mean, there were a lot of people in the movie. so if a fifth of them did a terrible job, then it shows. the plot was wanting also. the whole world isn't in some drug and alcohol induced riot. people just don't behave this way. then, if they did, there's the national guard. and martial law. where was that ? it just didn't cut it for me, and a poor choice in case you were watching it with a date. my recommendation for a strange off-the-wall movie: requiem for a dream.

    This is not a good movie. It felt like there was a good story buried here somewhere, like the movie had been poorly adapted from a Philip Dick novel. But this movie starts out mediocre, gets worse, and by the end is a laugher. The dialogue, characters, and plot are cheesy and clich&eacute;d. It's directed and shot like TV movie. The racial and gender themes are tacked on, do not feel authentic, and are never seriously addressed. The "surprise" was not particularly surprising. And on top of all that, it is long: almost 2 and a half hours. Ralph Fiennes is just about always watchable, and Juliette Lewis is topless several times. Other than that, there's very little to recommend here.

    Kathryn Bigelow directs a story and screenplay by James Cameron called "Strange Days." Made in 1995, the film is set in dark, chaotic 1999 as it heads toward 2000. Many feel 2000 will mark the end of the world - sound familiar? - but as we now know, 9/11 hadn't happened yet, and the date of the Rapture has been moved yet again. Ralph Fiennes is Lenny Nero, an ex-cop turned bootlegger dealing in illegal "squid" recordings - virtual-reality type tapes actually made from the cerebral cortex so that the viewer experiences true emotions as if the viewer were actually there. Lenny depends on a friend, Mace (Angela Bassett) while he still loves his ex-girlfriend, a singer named Faith (Juliette Lewis). A prostitute, Iris (Brigitte Bako) doing recordings for Lenny records something that soon gets Iris savagely murdered and Lenny and Mace running for their lives. There are some spectacular scenes. The best one (as far as I'm concerned) is with Lenny and Mace in Mace's car while they're being shot at and then set on fire. Don't miss it! Both Fiennes and Bassett are fantastic, and it would be hard to say which one is better. Bassett gives new meaning to the words "girl power" and Fiennes somehow makes his sleazoid character likable and sad. The support from Tom Sizemore, Vincent D'Onofrio et al. is tremendous. Great action from two masters - recommended.

    Strange Days is a very interesting and enjoyable cyber-punk-esque, end-of-the-millennium detective film. Set about four years after it was released (1995, i believe) its world is a close future in which Los Angeles is being torn apart by race riots and police brutality - all washed down with a hedonistic population clamouring for new sensations. Here we find the science-ficiton device. The "SQUID" prosthesis which allows peoples experiences to be recorded, reproduced and sold on the black market for people to experience for themselves. The story follows Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) into an intriguing and disturbing detective story centring on a murder recorded by one of these devices. Not only does the film flesh itself out with violence, car chases, and a pretty massive party but, through its use of the SQUID device, it allows for a good detective story to ask interesting questions about bodily experience - and the nature of that when it becomes recordable (turned into information) and sellable - when it becomes currency. So where is there fault with this film? (7*?) Well there isn't much really. At times the film's 'bad guy' seems to become that 90s villain we've seen so many times. And I think the plot-twist and the ending were both rather forced(but this is pretty big-budget stuff, so...). I could go on and list things which I think could have been better about the film but that would be not only useless but arrogant. This is a great film which, despite falling into a few of the usual traps, deals with some interesting themes and is very enjoyable to watch (and has some alright music in it too) - This is a film of its time which is defiantly worth watching.

    I had no idea this film even existed until it showed up in my Netflix 'recommended' column, and I decided to give it a shot after reading some good reviews on there. Wow, am I happy I did. This was a truly fantastic sci-fi thriller, with intense action and a truly engaging story. The characters were very well constructed and had a lot of substance to them, and of course the acting was superb. Who knew Ralph Finnes could play such a good lowlife? Set in an alternate (but totally recognizable) Los Angeles of 1999, the world has seemingly gone completely to hell, due to rampant poverty and class/racial tensions which are pushing society towards an all-out state of anarchy. The authorities are barely maintaining order, despite resorting to draconian measures to try and keep things in check. The director does an excellent job of painting this picture for us through fantastic environment and background shots which effectively build the tension and make us fully believe what is happening. In this world, they have invented a type of virtual reality which allows an individual to record everything they are seeing and feeling directly through their brain, so as to then be played back later through someone else's brain, which allows the user to then see and feel exactly what was recorded without any danger (other than possible addiction). So needless to say a huge black market has sprung up to provide people with recordings of all kinds of illicit, criminal and sexual activities that they'd never actually get to experience in the real world. The plot of the movie builds from this technology. However, other than this particular device and general state of social affairs, the alternate 1999 is pretty much identical to our 1999 (very much to it's credit). No flying cars, no wacky fashion, no aliens, no laser guns or anything like that. It was a great decision by the filmmakers to not bite off more than they could chew in that regard, as it would have distracted from a very solid story. The films weaknesses are few, but are there nonetheless. It was a bit long... although I'm not usually one to complain about that kind of thing, so long as the time is necessary to tell the story. In this case an argument can be made either way, though I personally feel they could have lost about fifteen minutes or so (but to me it's a minor issue). The director also felt the need to very quickly explain the origin of the virtual reality technology through a throwaway line of dialog, which really added nothing to the plot, and honestly made no sense; they said the technology was originally developed for the FBI so that informants wouldn't have to wear a wire, which is just dumb. The device is WAY more cumbersome and easily discoverable than a wire transmitter. How about saying that the military invented it to train soldiers more realistically? Or just leave it alone... true virtual reality is a technological holy grail. I don't think anyone questions why something like that would be invented in the first place, even if it's purely for entertainment. Additionally, in my opinion, a couple of the 'bad guys' could have had their motivations fleshed out a tad better, but that is a also very minor quibble. Beyond that, the look of the movie is quite dated, which could hinder the enjoyment for some people. The 1990's did not age very well to our eyes, and this movie is VERY much a product of that era. If you lived through it, you know what I mean. Younger viewers may not fully get the social and cultural allusions that this movie is built upon (Rodney King riots, 90's hip hop culture, rave clubs... things like that)... just something to keep in mind, although if you did live though it, you'll appreciate the depth that these references add. But really, I can't recommend this film highly enough. It's a completely under-appreciated piece of work, and one of the best sci-fi thrillers out there.

    A seemingly forgotten piece of Cyberpunk that traded heavily on pre-millennium hysteria, I hadn't seen 'Strange Days' since it was released. I certainly remember liking it... well, respecting it would be more accurate. I thought it was well made, but it wasn't the type of film I was itching to watch again any time soon. Fast forward nearly 20 years, and I got the itch again. My reaction now is pretty much the same as it was then. It's very well made (Directed by Kathryn Bigelow and co-written by then husband James Cameron). The cast is strong as well. Generally I find Ralph Fiennes a bore, but he's great here, showing more personality and life than I've ever seen from him before. Culturally it's a bit dated, but overall it holds up quite well. Not sure why this one seems to have slipped through the cracks. It's a very solid sci-fi thriller.

    This is a movie with so much potential but never really quite lives up to it. It's a great film which could have been the Blade Runner of its' time but just didn't quite make it. A fabulous performance from Ralph Fiennes, playing so much against type but succeeding brilliantly, even his American accent is convincing (at least to my British ears). Angela Bassett is simply a revelation, her amazing Mace a long way from her Tina Turner. Great supporting cast too especially from Tom Sizemore and William Fichtner as two police officers who suddenly find themselves in way over their heads. It is quite simply far too long, you could have cut out nearly all of the nightclub sequences and not lost anything. Of course we all know that the millennium turned out to be not anything like as it is depicted but in the post Rodney King era this didn't seem that far fetched. I simply cannot watch the scene where Iris is murdered in the bathtub, it is so horrible it beggars belief. You would say that this is a misogynist film if it wasn't written and directed by woman. It's hard to keep track of the plot but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Great central concept, wouldn't it be fantastic to be able to experience other peoples memories? The blazing limo scene is just terrific and Lenny is a surprisingly likable hero for such a dirtbag hustler (not least for the scene where he gives his friend in the wheelchair a clip of jogging along the beach). Laughed out loud at the sequence where he goes to confront the burglar in his flat only to realise he forgot to load his gun. Love, love, love the ending, the final kiss and embrace what we've all been rooting for all along. Adore the image of the hippy girl kissing the National Guardsman on top of the tank, just so beautiful, much like the LAPD coming good at the end showing humanity can prevail against all odds. And Mace and Lenny can get together and live happily ever after. Great music as well (the nightclub numbers aside) and adore Juliette Lewis character telling Lenny it's over, just pipping Mace reminding him that memories are meant to fade. A marvellous film that really deserved to do better at the box office.

    This 1995 movie takes place on December 30 and 31 1999. It's about a hustler named Lenny (Ralph Fiennes) who sells dreams (so to speak). You put on a device that covers the top of your head, insert a disc and it plays an experience that someone else had...but you see it through their eyes and hear it too. It's like a drug...very addictive. Then a friend of his is brutally murdered for a disc that has incriminating evidence against the LAPD that could lead to a war. Soon Lenny and ex-girlfriend Lornette (Angela Bassett) are running for their lives from people who will kill them for the disc. The plot is kind of hard to describe but the movie is fascinating. I first saw it up a theatre in stereo on a large screen and it blew me away. The imagery is incredible (excellent direction by Kathryn Bigelow) and the sound mix inventive. The movie isn't easy to watch at times--there's a VERY graphic sequence where a woman is tortured, raped and murdered--but it is needed for the plot. The plot is involved but I was never confused. The acting is, for the most part, great. Fiennes is great and Bassett is just incredible. They're both great actors and give their all to this. Tom Sizemore has a small role and he's pretty good. However Juliette Lewis is terrible as an ex of Lenny. Very wooden. The only real bad thing is the climax--it goes on for far too long (this movie doesn't have to run 145 minutes). This was lost back in 1995 and didn't even become known when director Bigelow won an Oscar for "The Hurt Locker"--but it deserves recognition. Well worth seeing.

    Strange Days is a very interesting and enjoyable cyber-punk-esque, end-of-the-millennium detective film. Set about four years after it was released (1995, i believe) its world is a close future in which Los Angeles is being torn apart by race riots and police brutality - all washed down with a hedonistic population clamouring for new sensations. Here we find the science-ficiton device. The "SQUID" prosthesis which allows peoples experiences to be recorded, reproduced and sold on the black market for people to experience for themselves. The story follows Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) into an intriguing and disturbing detective story centring on a murder recorded by one of these devices. Not only does the film flesh itself out with violence, car chases, and a pretty massive party but, through its use of the SQUID device, it allows for a good detective story to ask interesting questions about bodily experience - and the nature of that when it becomes recordable (turned into information) and sellable - when it becomes currency. So where is there fault with this film? (7*?) Well there isn't much really. At times the film's 'bad guy' seems to become that 90s villain we've seen so many times. And I think the plot-twist and the ending were both rather forced(but this is pretty big-budget stuff, so...). I could go on and list things which I think could have been better about the film but that would be not only useless but arrogant. This is a great film which, despite falling into a few of the usual traps, deals with some interesting themes and is very enjoyable to watch (and has some alright music in it too) - This is a film of its time which is defiantly worth watching.
