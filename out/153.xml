    In London, four very different people team up to commit armed robbery, then try to doublecross each other for the loot. From Charles Crichton comes a comedy that is bound to have anybody who watches it laughing like a looney! No kidding, A Fish Called Wanda is a comedic gold mine, it's one of the funniest movies ever to play on the silver screen. Ranked by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 funniest movies of all time, this film backs up that distinction heavily. Before I watched the film, I did not know what I was going to expect, but when I did see the film, I laughed myself silly! For one thing, the acting in the movie is brilliant, such as John Cleese (who also wrote the screenplay), Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline (who won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and Michael Palin. and basically the rest of the cast as a whole. By the way, I heard a story in which a man from Denmark laughed himself to death while he was watching this movie, I believe I could see where he would do that, as this movie is a comedic classic! There are many scenes in the film that will have you laughing yourself nuts. For instance, any scene where Otto goes berserk because somebody called him "stupid." The scenes where Ken tries to kill Mrs. Coady (who saw the getaway and later accuses one of them of trying to murder her dogs), but accidentally ends up killing her dogs, which leaves the former stricken with grief at the idea of killing animals, as well as the parts where Otto tries to apologize to Archie for insulting him and attacking him. Kevin Kline was outstanding, he deserved the Oscar that he won. In fact, everybody in the movie was outstanding. I had previously seen John Cleese on the classic television sitcom Faulty Towers (itself very hysterical to watch), and seeing him here, he further shows that he is a master of comedy in both movies and television. This is a definitely a good way to spend an hour and 48 minutes watching. All of the good things and all of the hype that you have heard about this movie are true, as this film truly is an outstanding and absolutely hilarious comedy. If you want a comedy that has got some gargantuan laughs, then look no further, for A Fish Called Wanda is just what a movie with gargantuan laughs is, a movie with gargantuan laughs (excuse me for my redundancy, but you probably understand what I'm saying). Anyhow, if I was given the chance to watch this movie again, I would grab it at the first opportunity I got. In short, if you haven't seen this film, then you've definitely got to see it. I could see why the AFI would rank this as one of the 100 funniest movies ever made, as it truly is one of the funniest movies ever made, and it shows more proof of John Cleese's genius at comedy. Bottom line: A Fish Called Wanda is a comedic marvel, you shouldn't miss it. 10/10

    John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline star in A Fish Called Wanda, a film about a robbery and how the conspirators betray each other. This film has more of entertainment value to it than laugh-out-loud laughs though. That's because it contains certain jokes and/or gags that go to such extreme, that they have a shocking effect on you and you find yourself laughing more out of surprise, rather than the joke being inherently funny in itself. I won't go into all of them, but I wouldn't say being caught naked is really that funny. Kevin Kline was great though. If you can't stand foul language at all, then skip this, because Otto is a "true vulgarian." And that "Manfranjensenten" is a highlight! While I say it's not very funny, I must say it's what I call a guilty pleasure, giving in to everyone's basic urge to do what is not expected, to be uncouth, and to do what is socially unacceptable and what you can't get away with in real life. And, maybe, this is just a satire on society's norm. To make you think, like Plato. It certainly leaves a definite impression. You'll walk away, loving every minute of it or thinking you'll never see it again. But if you do, you'll have to apologize!

    it's such a complete movie you can watch it multiple times, without feeling bored of it (i must have seen it 20 times) its a lot of fun to reenact certain lines with your family and friends, when somebody says something that reminds you of it. if you like British comedy, you will agree with me :) the whole cast is absolutely brilliant and there's such chemistry between them. the jokes don't feel corny or staged, and the comedy arises from how the situations unfold/happen, not from throwing jokes at you each time i watch it, there's other things that impress me and make me laugh and a lot of lines i can recite which ads to the fun. who doesn't remember ....? :) you will choose which line i meant here, because i think everybody has their own scenes that have left their imprint on you (sheep and sweaters ha ha) of course Kevin Kline is amazing actor here and in every other role, also Jamie Lee Curtis is a very talented actress and strangely sexy and thus perfect! Michael Palin and John Cleese add the nice dry British flair to them and Maria Atken (Wendy) is perfect as the snobbish wife i didn't like George's character, but he (Tom Georgeson) really played it perfectly too, nothing against the actor! just his character in the movie Altogether, the perfect comedy!

    A Fish Called Wanda is a very good movie with a fun and simple story line,a fantastic,funny and talented cast and some great characters,and you can clearly see in the movie that it is written by one of the six Monty Python's,that being John Cleese,who in my opinion is the best of the six and has made the best career outside of Monty Python out of the other five,he has made other comedy gold,such as Fawlty Towers and this movie. Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) is using many different men,a jewel robbery (Kevin Kline),one of his henchmen (Michael Palin) and the thief's lawyer (John Cleese) to get what he wants. -DILLON HARRIS

    "It is brilliantly written, uproariously funny and goes along at a pace as fast as the crack of a whip." A lot has been said about A Fish Called Wanda, everything has been said rightly, in fact this movie deserves the accolades. The movie epitomizes the term comedy classic in every way. The film looks great too, with the cinematography skillful and striking. The story is wonderfully constructed with seldom a dull moment, while the acting is superb. Four criminals come together to pull off a daring jewel robbery. Wanda is in relationship with George; tries to get rid off him with Otto (another roberer), portrayed as Wanda's brother among the robbers. It is great fun to watch each character trying to con the other out of their share of the loot. Its hilarious to listen to K..K..Ken trrr.... too... trying to negotiate with Otto. Its funny to see Archie's relationship with Wanda develop while his relationship with his wife has almost stagnated. Whether it's John Cleese's dance, Kevin Kline's rips at England, Michael Palin's stuttering, or Jamie Lee Curtis's deadpan performance, they know how to do everything here. I can't describe how funny the movie is; you just have to see it. And you may very well die laughing - or if nothing else, you'll want to take a trip to England. Kevin Kline definitely deserved his Oscar. And of course, the cast teamed up again for another funny movie "Fierce Creatures" (not Achieved the kind of success as this movie did). So go get yourself one of the best doses of comedy of 80s My Rating  8/10

    Definitely something to watch again and again. This is one hilarious movie full of double-crossers and mix-ups. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the funny double-crosser named Wanda who has a weakness for men who speak a foreign language as a second language (preferably Italian); she flirts her way to answers by however means necessary despite her "boyfriend's" jealousy risking everything. Then there's the lovable Ken who loves animals but has a "little bit" of a stutter problem, and who can't seem to do anything right. Last but not least, the "mastermind" who seemingly got the short end of the stickor did he? Great movie, I would love to buy!

    Wanda brings her secret lover, Otto to England to help her and her lover George and stuttering animal lover Ken steal $20 million in diamonds. Wanda and Otto then turn in George to the police so they can have the loot for themselves, but George has already moved the diamonds and only he knows where they are. All four of the criminals start double-crossing each other to try to get to the diamonds before anyone else. Wanda tries to find them by "getting close" to George's barrister, Archie Leach, because if George pleads guilty he will tell Archie where the diamonds are to cut his sentence...... The thing about TV celebrities turning their hand at comedy, is always a very risqu&eacute; one. For every Wanda, we have a Wilt, True Identity, Boys In Blue, Alien Autopsy, Morons From Outer Space, Guest House Paradiso...you get the picture. The Pythons have made films like this before, but with all the garbage released in-between, one couldn't help but worry a little. The film is hilarious, from the old age comedy of the class war, to simple stuff like name calling and mocking, the film rarely takes a step wrong. Cleese is perfect as Leach, the man who has it all, except guts and happiness. This man is the epitome of middle class males, all mouth but no trousers, and Cleese gets it down to a tee. Kudos to Palin, who plays the typical working class villain with an unfortunate tick. But the film is stolen by Kline, a career best performance and really worthy of the Oscar, when ever Otto is on screen, the rest may as well sit back, they haven't a chance with Kline. It's well written, charming, funny with a little devilish streak running down its back for good measure. A perfect example of why British humour was and always be the best.

    Hardly a Monty Python vehicle, but its remnants, Cleese and Palin has brought forth perhaps their best work so far (including the python period), a contemporary satire homing in the UK/USA self-mocking kernel, with their US counterparts, Curtis and Kline. Entertaining to its very core, the crime-light, pratfall-heavy comedy ingenuously spikes British humor in its comparatively foolhardy story of a manipulative woman's happy-ever-after scheme of misappropriating all the loots from a bank robbery in her own pocket and ditching her two lovers (the sinister-looking boss she framed and the dorky, jealous, violent American criminal she could not bear anymore) with the right man (a British lawyer) she has inadvertently encountered. There are some minor cruelty in the film since dogs are consecutively and (three-times-in-a- row) inadvertently killed and fish are eaten alive (including the titular Wanda), which may faintly offend animal right activists, but apart from that, other crucial gags and set pieces are all put into the right place, nudity, awkward cuckoldry, jokes, wisecrackers, teasing of philosophy, a touch of gayness and a little bit of action, you name it! Kline's winning of BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR is such an atypical victory, by virtue of now the snubs of distinguished comedic performances have been enacted in the official mind-set of the academy and most audience's minds (last year McCarthy's nomination for BRIDESMAIDS 2011, 7/10 is flipping wondrous), and Kline is winsome as a composite of egoist, goofiness, wide- eyedness and a ludicrous perilousness. Another delicious supporting contender, Palin, stuck in his self-conscious stammer as the boss' loyal sidekick, is still capable of merciless assassination, loses all his beloved fish as a retribution of killing three innocent puppies, but equipped with a feel good revenge in the end. Curtis has extensively excavated her comedy soul, being lithely tricky, but uncompromisingly attractive. Cleese, as the authentic linchpin of the film (he is also the co-writer, co-producer and an uncredited co-director), a well-off lawyer who is smitten with Curtis from his first glance, and being salutary from the ragbag mishaps, determinedly leaves his wealthier wife and ends up with the woman he is infatuated plus the dough, an all-too-hasty coda may or may not be exonerated. A FISH CALLED WANDA is director Charles Crichton's swan-song, I rate it a venerable 8 out 10 although the film itself may fall short of my usual criterion of the "great work" category, nevertheless, we all should cherish a bit more of decent comedies which is a needle in a haystack in the present market.

    What can be said about this movie? It's so good that describing how excellent it is just can't really be put into words, but I'll give it my best shot. The best character by far is Otto, the lovable, ex-CIA agent "weapons man" who is actually dumber than dirt, yet likes to read books on philosophy (but would be better off with Dr. Seuss). Kevin Kline deserved that shiny Oscar for his portrayal of a character so painfully stupid that he has no idea how dumb he really is. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the role of the sexy American girl who seduces John Cleese in an effort to find out whether he knows where the diamonds are, but since John Cleese is stuck in a loveless marriage with an uptight, frigid bitch, he's REALLY hooked by Jamie Lee Curtis. And of course, who can forget the lovable Michael Palin as the kind-hearted animal lover with a bad stutter who has the job of "rubbing out" the little old lady but accidentally pops off her little puppies (he is heartbroken by this) but feels no guilt for taking out a little old lady (who actually isn't particularly nice, and has heart troubles anyway). What makes this movie so awesome is that there are real characters, not stereotypes, and the movie is wonderfully quotable, and has that Monty Python flavor but with a true plot that viewers can hook into, even if they don't like or haven't seen Monty Python before. wonderful movie, my favorite movie ever.

    There are at least two soi-disant film comedies that are less funny than this one: Blazing Saddles and Team America. I couldn't sit all the way through either of those two, but I managed to last the distance with this one. This was due to the crude stupefaction factor, since I was curious to see what would happen next. I did not laugh, once. There seems to me nothing funny at all in a badly timed narrative about retarded criminals and idiots with speech impediments, squashed little dogs and murdered little old ladies. Nor the repulsive consumption of live goldfish, and foul-mouthed trading of cretinous insults. I struggle to think of a single witty line. The only part which was at all real was played by the actress playing John Cleese's wife: she made a number of excellent points. She could have deserved an extra star, but she wasn't funny. This script, and the performances of the rest of the highly unattractive characters, including masculine Ms Curtis, belong to the Jerry Lewis, Mel Brooks, Abbott and Costello school of comedy: go cross-eyed, splay-footed and gabble: Look, I'm being funny! What a pity it didn't end with everybody shooting themselves for incompetent failure.

But the film is stolen by Kline, a career best performance and really worthy of the Oscar, when ever Otto is on screen, the rest may as well sit back, they haven't a chance with Kline. It's well written, charming, funny with a little devilish streak running down its back for good measure. A perfect example of why British humour was and always be the best.

    Hardly a Monty Python vehicle, but its remnants, Cleese and Palin has brought forth perhaps their best work so far (including the python period), a contemporary satire homing in the UK/USA self-mocking kernel, with their US counterparts, Curtis and Kline. Entertaining to its very core, the crime-light, pratfall-heavy comedy ingenuously spikes British humor in its comparatively foolhardy story of a manipulative woman's happy-ever-after scheme of misappropriating all the loots from a bank robbery in her own pocket and ditching her two lovers (the sinister-looking boss she framed and the dorky, jealous, violent American criminal she could not bear anymore) with the right man (a British lawyer) she has inadvertently encountered. There are some minor cruelty in the film since dogs are consecutively and (three-times-in-a- row) inadvertently killed and fish are eaten alive (including the titular Wanda), which may faintly offend animal right activists, but apart from that, other crucial gags and set pieces are all put into the right place, nudity, awkward cuckoldry, jokes, wisecrackers, teasing of philosophy, a touch of gayness and a little bit of action, you name it! Kline's winning of BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR is such an atypical victory, by virtue of now the snubs of distinguished comedic performances have been enacted in the official mind-set of the academy and most audience's minds (last year McCarthy's nomination for BRIDESMAIDS 2011, 7/10 is flipping wondrous), and Kline is winsome as a composite of egoist, goofiness, wide- eyedness and a ludicrous perilousness. Another delicious supporting contender, Palin, stuck in his self-conscious stammer as the boss' loyal sidekick, is still capable of merciless assassination, loses all his beloved fish as a retribution of killing three innocent puppies, but equipped with a feel good revenge in the end. Curtis has extensively excavated her comedy soul, being lithely tricky, but uncompromisingly attractive. Cleese, as the authentic linchpin of the film (he is also the co-writer, co-producer and an uncredited co-director), a well-off lawyer who is smitten with Curtis from his first glance, and being salutary from the ragbag mishaps, determinedly leaves his wealthier wife and ends up with the woman he is infatuated plus the dough, an all-too-hasty coda may or may not be exonerated. A FISH CALLED WANDA is director Charles Crichton's swan-song, I rate it a venerable 8 out 10 although the film itself may fall short of my usual criterion of the "great work" category, nevertheless, we all should cherish a bit more of decent comedies which is a needle in a haystack in the present market.

    What can be said about this movie? It's so good that describing how excellent it is just can't really be put into words, but I'll give it my best shot. The best character by far is Otto, the lovable, ex-CIA agent "weapons man" who is actually dumber than dirt, yet likes to read books on philosophy (but would be better off with Dr. Seuss). Kevin Kline deserved that shiny Oscar for his portrayal of a character so painfully stupid that he has no idea how dumb he really is. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the role of the sexy American girl who seduces John Cleese in an effort to find out whether he knows where the diamonds are, but since John Cleese is stuck in a loveless marriage with an uptight, frigid bitch, he's REALLY hooked by Jamie Lee Curtis. And of course, who can forget the lovable Michael Palin as the kind-hearted animal lover with a bad stutter who has the job of "rubbing out" the little old lady but accidentally pops off her little puppies (he is heartbroken by this) but feels no guilt for taking out a little old lady (who actually isn't particularly nice, and has heart troubles anyway). What makes this movie so awesome is that there are real characters, not stereotypes, and the movie is wonderfully quotable, and has that Monty Python flavor but with a true plot that viewers can hook into, even if they don't like or haven't seen Monty Python before. wonderful movie, my favorite movie ever.

    There are at least two soi-disant film comedies that are less funny than this one: Blazing Saddles and Team America. I couldn't sit all the way through either of those two, but I managed to last the distance with this one. This was due to the crude stupefaction factor, since I was curious to see what would happen next. I did not laugh, once. There seems to me nothing funny at all in a badly timed narrative about retarded criminals and idiots with speech impediments, squashed little dogs and murdered little old ladies. Nor the repulsive consumption of live goldfish, and foul-mouthed trading of cretinous insults. I struggle to think of a single witty line. The only part which was at all real was played by the actress playing John Cleese's wife: she made a number of excellent points. She could have deserved an extra star, but she wasn't funny. This script, and the performances of the rest of the highly unattractive characters, including masculine Ms Curtis, belong to the Jerry Lewis, Mel Brooks, Abbott and Costello school of comedy: go cross-eyed, splay-footed and gabble: Look, I'm being funny! What a pity it didn't end with everybody shooting themselves for incompetent failure.

    In London, four very different people team up to commit armed robbery, then try to doublecross each other for the loot. From Charles Crichton comes a comedy that is bound to have anybody who watches it laughing like a looney! No kidding, A Fish Called Wanda is a comedic gold mine, it's one of the funniest movies ever to play on the silver screen. Ranked by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 funniest movies of all time, this film backs up that distinction heavily. Before I watched the film, I did not know what I was going to expect, but when I did see the film, I laughed myself silly! For one thing, the acting in the movie is brilliant, such as John Cleese (who also wrote the screenplay), Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline (who won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and Michael Palin. and basically the rest of the cast as a whole. By the way, I heard a story in which a man from Denmark laughed himself to death while he was watching this movie, I believe I could see where he would do that, as this movie is a comedic classic! There are many scenes in the film that will have you laughing yourself nuts. For instance, any scene where Otto goes berserk because somebody called him "stupid." The scenes where Ken tries to kill Mrs. Coady (who saw the getaway and later accuses one of them of trying to murder her dogs), but accidentally ends up killing her dogs, which leaves the former stricken with grief at the idea of killing animals, as well as the parts where Otto tries to apologize to Archie for insulting him and attacking him. Kevin Kline was outstanding, he deserved the Oscar that he won. In fact, everybody in the movie was outstanding. I had previously seen John Cleese on the classic television sitcom Faulty Towers (itself very hysterical to watch), and seeing him here, he further shows that he is a master of comedy in both movies and television. This is a definitely a good way to spend an hour and 48 minutes watching. All of the good things and all of the hype that you have heard about this movie are true, as this film truly is an outstanding and absolutely hilarious comedy. If you want a comedy that has got some gargantuan laughs, then look no further, for A Fish Called Wanda is just what a movie with gargantuan laughs is, a movie with gargantuan laughs (excuse me for my redundancy, but you probably understand what I'm saying). Anyhow, if I was given the chance to watch this movie again, I would grab it at the first opportunity I got. In short, if you haven't seen this film, then you've definitely got to see it. I could see why the AFI would rank this as one of the 100 funniest movies ever made, as it truly is one of the funniest movies ever made, and it shows more proof of John Cleese's genius at comedy. Bottom line: A Fish Called Wanda is a comedic marvel, you shouldn't miss it. 10/10

    John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline star in A Fish Called Wanda, a film about a robbery and how the conspirators betray each other. This film has more of entertainment value to it than laugh-out-loud laughs though. That's because it contains certain jokes and/or gags that go to such extreme, that they have a shocking effect on you and you find yourself laughing more out of surprise, rather than the joke being inherently funny in itself. I won't go into all of them, but I wouldn't say being caught naked is really that funny. Kevin Kline was great though. If you can't stand foul language at all, then skip this, because Otto is a "true vulgarian." And that "Manfranjensenten" is a highlight! While I say it's not very funny, I must say it's what I call a guilty pleasure, giving in to everyone's basic urge to do what is not expected, to be uncouth, and to do what is socially unacceptable and what you can't get away with in real life. And, maybe, this is just a satire on society's norm. To make you think, like Plato. It certainly leaves a definite impression. You'll walk away, loving every minute of it or thinking you'll never see it again. But if you do, you'll have to apologize!

    it's such a complete movie you can watch it multiple times, without feeling bored of it (i must have seen it 20 times) its a lot of fun to reenact certain lines with your family and friends, when somebody says something that reminds you of it. if you like British comedy, you will agree with me :) the whole cast is absolutely brilliant and there's such chemistry between them. the jokes don't feel corny or staged, and the comedy arises from how the situations unfold/happen, not from throwing jokes at you each time i watch it, there's other things that impress me and make me laugh and a lot of lines i can recite which ads to the fun. who doesn't remember ....? :) you will choose which line i meant here, because i think everybody has their own scenes that have left their imprint on you (sheep and sweaters ha ha) of course Kevin Kline is amazing actor here and in every other role, also Jamie Lee Curtis is a very talented actress and strangely sexy and thus perfect! Michael Palin and John Cleese add the nice dry British flair to them and Maria Atken (Wendy) is perfect as the snobbish wife i didn't like George's character, but he (Tom Georgeson) really played it perfectly too, nothing against the actor! just his character in the movie Altogether, the perfect comedy!

    A Fish Called Wanda is a very good movie with a fun and simple story line,a fantastic,funny and talented cast and some great characters,and you can clearly see in the movie that it is written by one of the six Monty Python's,that being John Cleese,who in my opinion is the best of the six and has made the best career outside of Monty Python out of the other five,he has made other comedy gold,such as Fawlty Towers and this movie. Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) is using many different men,a jewel robbery (Kevin Kline),one of his henchmen (Michael Palin) and the thief's lawyer (John Cleese) to get what he wants. -DILLON HARRIS

    "It is brilliantly written, uproariously funny and goes along at a pace as fast as the crack of a whip." A lot has been said about A Fish Called Wanda, everything has been said rightly, in fact this movie deserves the accolades. The movie epitomizes the term comedy classic in every way. The film looks great too, with the cinematography skillful and striking. The story is wonderfully constructed with seldom a dull moment, while the acting is superb. Four criminals come together to pull off a daring jewel robbery. Wanda is in relationship with George; tries to get rid off him with Otto (another roberer), portrayed as Wanda's brother among the robbers. It is great fun to watch each character trying to con the other out of their share of the loot. Its hilarious to listen to K..K..Ken trrr.... too... trying to negotiate with Otto. Its funny to see Archie's relationship with Wanda develop while his relationship with his wife has almost stagnated. Whether it's John Cleese's dance, Kevin Kline's rips at England, Michael Palin's stuttering, or Jamie Lee Curtis's deadpan performance, they know how to do everything here. I can't describe how funny the movie is; you just have to see it. And you may very well die laughing - or if nothing else, you'll want to take a trip to England. Kevin Kline definitely deserved his Oscar. And of course, the cast teamed up again for another funny movie "Fierce Creatures" (not Achieved the kind of success as this movie did). So go get yourself one of the best doses of comedy of 80s My Rating  8/10

    Definitely something to watch again and again. This is one hilarious movie full of double-crossers and mix-ups. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the funny double-crosser named Wanda who has a weakness for men who speak a foreign language as a second language (preferably Italian); she flirts her way to answers by however means necessary despite her "boyfriend's" jealousy risking everything. Then there's the lovable Ken who loves animals but has a "little bit" of a stutter problem, and who can't seem to do anything right. Last but not least, the "mastermind" who seemingly got the short end of the stickor did he? Great movie, I would love to buy!

    Wanda brings her secret lover, Otto to England to help her and her lover George and stuttering animal lover Ken steal $20 million in diamonds. Wanda and Otto then turn in George to the police so they can have the loot for themselves, but George has already moved the diamonds and only he knows where they are. All four of the criminals start double-crossing each other to try to get to the diamonds before anyone else. Wanda tries to find them by "getting close" to George's barrister, Archie Leach, because if George pleads guilty he will tell Archie where the diamonds are to cut his sentence...... The thing about TV celebrities turning their hand at comedy, is always a very risqu&eacute; one. For every Wanda, we have a Wilt, True Identity, Boys In Blue, Alien Autopsy, Morons From Outer Space, Guest House Paradiso...you get the picture. The Pythons have made films like this before, but with all the garbage released in-between, one couldn't help but worry a little. The film is hilarious, from the old age comedy of the class war, to simple stuff like name calling and mocking, the film rarely takes a step wrong. Cleese is perfect as Leach, the man who has it all, except guts and happiness. This man is the epitome of middle class males, all mouth but no trousers, and Cleese gets it down to a tee. Kudos to Palin, who plays the typical working class villain with an unfortunate tick. But the film is stolen by Kline, a career best performance and really worthy of the Oscar, when ever Otto is on screen, the rest may as well sit back, they haven't a chance with Kline. It's well written, charming, funny with a little devilish streak running down its back for good measure. A perfect example of why British humour was and always be the best.

    "It is brilliantly written, uproariously funny and goes along at a pace as fast as the crack of a whip." A lot has been said about A Fish Called Wanda, everything has been said rightly, in fact this movie deserves the accolades. The movie epitomizes the term comedy classic in every way. The film looks great too, with the cinematography skillful and striking. The story is wonderfully constructed with seldom a dull moment, while the acting is superb. Four criminals come together to pull off a daring jewel robbery. Wanda is in relationship with George; tries to get rid off him with Otto (another roberer), portrayed as Wanda's brother among the robbers. It is great fun to watch each character trying to con the other out of their share of the loot. Its hilarious to listen to K..K..Ken trrr.... too... trying to negotiate with Otto. Its funny to see Archie's relationship with Wanda develop while his relationship with his wife has almost stagnated. Whether it's John Cleese's dance, Kevin Kline's rips at England, Michael Palin's stuttering, or Jamie Lee Curtis's deadpan performance, they know how to do everything here. I can't describe how funny the movie is; you just have to see it. And you may very well die laughing - or if nothing else, you'll want to take a trip to England. Kevin Kline definitely deserved his Oscar. And of course, the cast teamed up again for another funny movie "Fierce Creatures" (not Achieved the kind of success as this movie did). So go get yourself one of the best doses of comedy of 80s My Rating  8/10

    Definitely something to watch again and again. This is one hilarious movie full of double-crossers and mix-ups. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the funny double-crosser named Wanda who has a weakness for men who speak a foreign language as a second language (preferably Italian); she flirts her way to answers by however means necessary despite her "boyfriend's" jealousy risking everything. Then there's the lovable Ken who loves animals but has a "little bit" of a stutter problem, and who can't seem to do anything right. Last but not least, the "mastermind" who seemingly got the short end of the stickor did he? Great movie, I would love to buy!

    Wanda brings her secret lover, Otto to England to help her and her lover George and stuttering animal lover Ken steal $20 million in diamonds. Wanda and Otto then turn in George to the police so they can have the loot for themselves, but George has already moved the diamonds and only he knows where they are. All four of the criminals start double-crossing each other to try to get to the diamonds before anyone else. Wanda tries to find them by "getting close" to George's barrister, Archie Leach, because if George pleads guilty he will tell Archie where the diamonds are to cut his sentence...... The thing about TV celebrities turning their hand at comedy, is always a very risqu&eacute; one. For every Wanda, we have a Wilt, True Identity, Boys In Blue, Alien Autopsy, Morons From Outer Space, Guest House Paradiso...you get the picture. The Pythons have made films like this before, but with all the garbage released in-between, one couldn't help but worry a little. The film is hilarious, from the old age comedy of the class war, to simple stuff like name calling and mocking, the film rarely takes a step wrong. Cleese is perfect as Leach, the man who has it all, except guts and happiness. This man is the epitome of middle class males, all mouth but no trousers, and Cleese gets it down to a tee. Kudos to Palin, who plays the typical working class villain with an unfortunate tick. But the film is stolen by Kline, a career best performance and really worthy of the Oscar, when ever Otto is on screen, the rest may as well sit back, they haven't a chance with Kline. It's well written, charming, funny with a little devilish streak running down its back for good measure. A perfect example of why British humour was and always be the best.

    Hardly a Monty Python vehicle, but its remnants, Cleese and Palin has brought forth perhaps their best work so far (including the python period), a contemporary satire homing in the UK/USA self-mocking kernel, with their US counterparts, Curtis and Kline. Entertaining to its very core, the crime-light, pratfall-heavy comedy ingenuously spikes British humor in its comparatively foolhardy story of a manipulative woman's happy-ever-after scheme of misappropriating all the loots from a bank robbery in her own pocket and ditching her two lovers (the sinister-looking boss she framed and the dorky, jealous, violent American criminal she could not bear anymore) with the right man (a British lawyer) she has inadvertently encountered. There are some minor cruelty in the film since dogs are consecutively and (three-times-in-a- row) inadvertently killed and fish are eaten alive (including the titular Wanda), which may faintly offend animal right activists, but apart from that, other crucial gags and set pieces are all put into the right place, nudity, awkward cuckoldry, jokes, wisecrackers, teasing of philosophy, a touch of gayness and a little bit of action, you name it! Kline's winning of BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR is such an atypical victory, by virtue of now the snubs of distinguished comedic performances have been enacted in the official mind-set of the academy and most audience's minds (last year McCarthy's nomination for BRIDESMAIDS 2011, 7/10 is flipping wondrous), and Kline is winsome as a composite of egoist, goofiness, wide- eyedness and a ludicrous perilousness. Another delicious supporting contender, Palin, stuck in his self-conscious stammer as the boss' loyal sidekick, is still capable of merciless assassination, loses all his beloved fish as a retribution of killing three innocent puppies, but equipped with a feel good revenge in the end. Curtis has extensively excavated her comedy soul, being lithely tricky, but uncompromisingly attractive. Cleese, as the authentic linchpin of the film (he is also the co-writer, co-producer and an uncredited co-director), a well-off lawyer who is smitten with Curtis from his first glance, and being salutary from the ragbag mishaps, determinedly leaves his wealthier wife and ends up with the woman he is infatuated plus the dough, an all-too-hasty coda may or may not be exonerated. A FISH CALLED WANDA is director Charles Crichton's swan-song, I rate it a venerable 8 out 10 although the film itself may fall short of my usual criterion of the "great work" category, nevertheless, we all should cherish a bit more of decent comedies which is a needle in a haystack in the present market.

    What can be said about this movie? It's so good that describing how excellent it is just can't really be put into words, but I'll give it my best shot. The best character by far is Otto, the lovable, ex-CIA agent "weapons man" who is actually dumber than dirt, yet likes to read books on philosophy (but would be better off with Dr. Seuss). Kevin Kline deserved that shiny Oscar for his portrayal of a character so painfully stupid that he has no idea how dumb he really is. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the role of the sexy American girl who seduces John Cleese in an effort to find out whether he knows where the diamonds are, but since John Cleese is stuck in a loveless marriage with an uptight, frigid bitch, he's REALLY hooked by Jamie Lee Curtis. And of course, who can forget the lovable Michael Palin as the kind-hearted animal lover with a bad stutter who has the job of "rubbing out" the little old lady but accidentally pops off her little puppies (he is heartbroken by this) but feels no guilt for taking out a little old lady (who actually isn't particularly nice, and has heart troubles anyway). What makes this movie so awesome is that there are real characters, not stereotypes, and the movie is wonderfully quotable, and has that Monty Python flavor but with a true plot that viewers can hook into, even if they don't like or haven't seen Monty Python before. wonderful movie, my favorite movie ever.

    There are at least two soi-disant film comedies that are less funny than this one: Blazing Saddles and Team America. I couldn't sit all the way through either of those two, but I managed to last the distance with this one. This was due to the crude stupefaction factor, since I was curious to see what would happen next. I did not laugh, once. There seems to me nothing funny at all in a badly timed narrative about retarded criminals and idiots with speech impediments, squashed little dogs and murdered little old ladies. Nor the repulsive consumption of live goldfish, and foul-mouthed trading of cretinous insults. I struggle to think of a single witty line. The only part which was at all real was played by the actress playing John Cleese's wife: she made a number of excellent points. She could have deserved an extra star, but she wasn't funny. This script, and the performances of the rest of the highly unattractive characters, including masculine Ms Curtis, belong to the Jerry Lewis, Mel Brooks, Abbott and Costello school of comedy: go cross-eyed, splay-footed and gabble: Look, I'm being funny! What a pity it didn't end with everybody shooting themselves for incompetent failure.

    In London, four very different people team up to commit armed robbery, then try to doublecross each other for the loot. From Charles Crichton comes a comedy that is bound to have anybody who watches it laughing like a looney! No kidding, A Fish Called Wanda is a comedic gold mine, it's one of the funniest movies ever to play on the silver screen. Ranked by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 funniest movies of all time, this film backs up that distinction heavily. Before I watched the film, I did not know what I was going to expect, but when I did see the film, I laughed myself silly! For one thing, the acting in the movie is brilliant, such as John Cleese (who also wrote the screenplay), Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline (who won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and Michael Palin. and basically the rest of the cast as a whole. By the way, I heard a story in which a man from Denmark laughed himself to death while he was watching this movie, I believe I could see where he would do that, as this movie is a comedic classic! There are many scenes in the film that will have you laughing yourself nuts. For instance, any scene where Otto goes berserk because somebody called him "stupid." The scenes where Ken tries to kill Mrs. Coady (who saw the getaway and later accuses one of them of trying to murder her dogs), but accidentally ends up killing her dogs, which leaves the former stricken with grief at the idea of killing animals, as well as the parts where Otto tries to apologize to Archie for insulting him and attacking him. Kevin Kline was outstanding, he deserved the Oscar that he won. In fact, everybody in the movie was outstanding. I had previously seen John Cleese on the classic television sitcom Faulty Towers (itself very hysterical to watch), and seeing him here, he further shows that he is a master of comedy in both movies and television. This is a definitely a good way to spend an hour and 48 minutes watching. All of the good things and all of the hype that you have heard about this movie are true, as this film truly is an outstanding and absolutely hilarious comedy. If you want a comedy that has got some gargantuan laughs, then look no further, for A Fish Called Wanda is just what a movie with gargantuan laughs is, a movie with gargantuan laughs (excuse me for my redundancy, but you probably understand what I'm saying). Anyhow, if I was given the chance to watch this movie again, I would grab it at the first opportunity I got. In short, if you haven't seen this film, then you've definitely got to see it. I could see why the AFI would rank this as one of the 100 funniest movies ever made, as it truly is one of the funniest movies ever made, and it shows more proof of John Cleese's genius at comedy. Bottom line: A Fish Called Wanda is a comedic marvel, you shouldn't miss it. 10/10

    John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline star in A Fish Called Wanda, a film about a robbery and how the conspirators betray each other. This film has more of entertainment value to it than laugh-out-loud laughs though. That's because it contains certain jokes and/or gags that go to such extreme, that they have a shocking effect on you and you find yourself laughing more out of surprise, rather than the joke being inherently funny in itself. I won't go into all of them, but I wouldn't say being caught naked is really that funny. Kevin Kline was great though. If you can't stand foul language at all, then skip this, because Otto is a "true vulgarian." And that "Manfranjensenten" is a highlight! While I say it's not very funny, I must say it's what I call a guilty pleasure, giving in to everyone's basic urge to do what is not expected, to be uncouth, and to do what is socially unacceptable and what you can't get away with in real life. And, maybe, this is just a satire on society's norm. To make you think, like Plato. It certainly leaves a definite impression. You'll walk away, loving every minute of it or thinking you'll never see it again. But if you do, you'll have to apologize!

    it's such a complete movie you can watch it multiple times, without feeling bored of it (i must have seen it 20 times) its a lot of fun to reenact certain lines with your family and friends, when somebody says something that reminds you of it. if you like British comedy, you will agree with me :) the whole cast is absolutely brilliant and there's such chemistry between them. the jokes don't feel corny or staged, and the comedy arises from how the situations unfold/happen, not from throwing jokes at you each time i watch it, there's other things that impress me and make me laugh and a lot of lines i can recite which ads to the fun. who doesn't remember ....? :) you will choose which line i meant here, because i think everybody has their own scenes that have left their imprint on you (sheep and sweaters ha ha) of course Kevin Kline is amazing actor here and in every other role, also Jamie Lee Curtis is a very talented actress and strangely sexy and thus perfect! Michael Palin and John Cleese add the nice dry British flair to them and Maria Atken (Wendy) is perfect as the snobbish wife i didn't like George's character, but he (Tom Georgeson) really played it perfectly too, nothing against the actor! just his character in the movie Altogether, the perfect comedy!

    A Fish Called Wanda is a very good movie with a fun and simple story line,a fantastic,funny and talented cast and some great characters,and you can clearly see in the movie that it is written by one of the six Monty Python's,that being John Cleese,who in my opinion is the best of the six and has made the best career outside of Monty Python out of the other five,he has made other comedy gold,such as Fawlty Towers and this movie. Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) is using many different men,a jewel robbery (Kevin Kline),one of his henchmen (Michael Palin) and the thief's lawyer (John Cleese) to get what he wants. -DILLON HARRIS

    John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline star in A Fish Called Wanda, a film about a robbery and how the conspirators betray each other. This film has more of entertainment value to it than laugh-out-loud laughs though. That's because it contains certain jokes and/or gags that go to such extreme, that they have a shocking effect on you and you find yourself laughing more out of surprise, rather than the joke being inherently funny in itself. I won't go into all of them, but I wouldn't say being caught naked is really that funny. Kevin Kline was great though. If you can't stand foul language at all, then skip this, because Otto is a "true vulgarian." And that "Manfranjensenten" is a highlight! While I say it's not very funny, I must say it's what I call a guilty pleasure, giving in to everyone's basic urge to do what is not expected, to be uncouth, and to do what is socially unacceptable and what you can't get away with in real life. And, maybe, this is just a satire on society's norm. To make you think, like Plato. It certainly leaves a definite impression. You'll walk away, loving every minute of it or thinking you'll never see it again. But if you do, you'll have to apologize!

    it's such a complete movie you can watch it multiple times, without feeling bored of it (i must have seen it 20 times) its a lot of fun to reenact certain lines with your family and friends, when somebody says something that reminds you of it. if you like British comedy, you will agree with me :) the whole cast is absolutely brilliant and there's such chemistry between them. the jokes don't feel corny or staged, and the comedy arises from how the situations unfold/happen, not from throwing jokes at you each time i watch it, there's other things that impress me and make me laugh and a lot of lines i can recite which ads to the fun. who doesn't remember ....? :) you will choose which line i meant here, because i think everybody has their own scenes that have left their imprint on you (sheep and sweaters ha ha) of course Kevin Kline is amazing actor here and in every other role, also Jamie Lee Curtis is a very talented actress and strangely sexy and thus perfect! Michael Palin and John Cleese add the nice dry British flair to them and Maria Atken (Wendy) is perfect as the snobbish wife i didn't like George's character, but he (Tom Georgeson) really played it perfectly too, nothing against the actor! just his character in the movie Altogether, the perfect comedy!

    A Fish Called Wanda is a very good movie with a fun and simple story line,a fantastic,funny and talented cast and some great characters,and you can clearly see in the movie that it is written by one of the six Monty Python's,that being John Cleese,who in my opinion is the best of the six and has made the best career outside of Monty Python out of the other five,he has made other comedy gold,such as Fawlty Towers and this movie. Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) is using many different men,a jewel robbery (Kevin Kline),one of his henchmen (Michael Palin) and the thief's lawyer (John Cleese) to get what he wants. -DILLON HARRIS

    "It is brilliantly written, uproariously funny and goes along at a pace as fast as the crack of a whip." A lot has been said about A Fish Called Wanda, everything has been said rightly, in fact this movie deserves the accolades. The movie epitomizes the term comedy classic in every way. The film looks great too, with the cinematography skillful and striking. The story is wonderfully constructed with seldom a dull moment, while the acting is superb. Four criminals come together to pull off a daring jewel robbery. Wanda is in relationship with George; tries to get rid off him with Otto (another roberer), portrayed as Wanda's brother among the robbers. It is great fun to watch each character trying to con the other out of their share of the loot. Its hilarious to listen to K..K..Ken trrr.... too... trying to negotiate with Otto. Its funny to see Archie's relationship with Wanda develop while his relationship with his wife has almost stagnated. Whether it's John Cleese's dance, Kevin Kline's rips at England, Michael Palin's stuttering, or Jamie Lee Curtis's deadpan performance, they know how to do everything here. I can't describe how funny the movie is; you just have to see it. And you may very well die laughing - or if nothing else, you'll want to take a trip to England. Kevin Kline definitely deserved his Oscar. And of course, the cast teamed up again for another funny movie "Fierce Creatures" (not Achieved the kind of success as this movie did). So go get yourself one of the best doses of comedy of 80s My Rating  8/10

    Definitely something to watch again and again. This is one hilarious movie full of double-crossers and mix-ups. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the funny double-crosser named Wanda who has a weakness for men who speak a foreign language as a second language (preferably Italian); she flirts her way to answers by however means necessary despite her "boyfriend's" jealousy risking everything. Then there's the lovable Ken who loves animals but has a "little bit" of a stutter problem, and who can't seem to do anything right. Last but not least, the "mastermind" who seemingly got the short end of the stickor did he? Great movie, I would love to buy!

    Wanda brings her secret lover, Otto to England to help her and her lover George and stuttering animal lover Ken steal $20 million in diamonds. Wanda and Otto then turn in George to the police so they can have the loot for themselves, but George has already moved the diamonds and only he knows where they are. All four of the criminals start double-crossing each other to try to get to the diamonds before anyone else. Wanda tries to find them by "getting close" to George's barrister, Archie Leach, because if George pleads guilty he will tell Archie where the diamonds are to cut his sentence...... The thing about TV celebrities turning their hand at comedy, is always a very risqu&eacute; one. For every Wanda, we have a Wilt, True Identity, Boys In Blue, Alien Autopsy, Morons From Outer Space, Guest House Paradiso...you get the picture. The Pythons have made films like this before, but with all the garbage released in-between, one couldn't help but worry a little. The film is hilarious, from the old age comedy of the class war, to simple stuff like name calling and mocking, the film rarely takes a step wrong. Cleese is perfect as Leach, the man who has it all, except guts and happiness. This man is the epitome of middle class males, all mouth but no trousers, and Cleese gets it down to a tee. Kudos to Palin, who plays the typical working class villain with an unfortunate tick. But the film is stolen by Kline, a career best performance and really worthy of the Oscar, when ever Otto is on screen, the rest may as well sit back, they haven't a chance with Kline. It's well written, charming, funny with a little devilish streak running down its back for good measure. A perfect example of why British humour was and always be the best.

    Hardly a Monty Python vehicle, but its remnants, Cleese and Palin has brought forth perhaps their best work so far (including the python period), a contemporary satire homing in the UK/USA self-mocking kernel, with their US counterparts, Curtis and Kline. Entertaining to its very core, the crime-light, pratfall-heavy comedy ingenuously spikes British humor in its comparatively foolhardy story of a manipulative woman's happy-ever-after scheme of misappropriating all the loots from a bank robbery in her own pocket and ditching her two lovers (the sinister-looking boss she framed and the dorky, jealous, violent American criminal she could not bear anymore) with the right man (a British lawyer) she has inadvertently encountered. There are some minor cruelty in the film since dogs are consecutively and (three-times-in-a- row) inadvertently killed and fish are eaten alive (including the titular Wanda), which may faintly offend animal right activists, but apart from that, other crucial gags and set pieces are all put into the right place, nudity, awkward cuckoldry, jokes, wisecrackers, teasing of philosophy, a touch of gayness and a little bit of action, you name it! Kline's winning of BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR is such an atypical victory, by virtue of now the snubs of distinguished comedic performances have been enacted in the official mind-set of the academy and most audience's minds (last year McCarthy's nomination for BRIDESMAIDS 2011, 7/10 is flipping wondrous), and Kline is winsome as a composite of egoist, goofiness, wide- eyedness and a ludicrous perilousness. Another delicious supporting contender, Palin, stuck in his self-conscious stammer as the boss' loyal sidekick, is still capable of merciless assassination, loses all his beloved fish as a retribution of killing three innocent puppies, but equipped with a feel good revenge in the end. Curtis has extensively excavated her comedy soul, being lithely tricky, but uncompromisingly attractive. Cleese, as the authentic linchpin of the film (he is also the co-writer, co-producer and an uncredited co-director), a well-off lawyer who is smitten with Curtis from his first glance, and being salutary from the ragbag mishaps, determinedly leaves his wealthier wife and ends up with the woman he is infatuated plus the dough, an all-too-hasty coda may or may not be exonerated. A FISH CALLED WANDA is director Charles Crichton's swan-song, I rate it a venerable 8 out 10 although the film itself may fall short of my usual criterion of the "great work" category, nevertheless, we all should cherish a bit more of decent comedies which is a needle in a haystack in the present market.

    What can be said about this movie? It's so good that describing how excellent it is just can't really be put into words, but I'll give it my best shot. The best character by far is Otto, the lovable, ex-CIA agent "weapons man" who is actually dumber than dirt, yet likes to read books on philosophy (but would be better off with Dr. Seuss). Kevin Kline deserved that shiny Oscar for his portrayal of a character so painfully stupid that he has no idea how dumb he really is. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the role of the sexy American girl who seduces John Cleese in an effort to find out whether he knows where the diamonds are, but since John Cleese is stuck in a loveless marriage with an uptight, frigid bitch, he's REALLY hooked by Jamie Lee Curtis. And of course, who can forget the lovable Michael Palin as the kind-hearted animal lover with a bad stutter who has the job of "rubbing out" the little old lady but accidentally pops off her little puppies (he is heartbroken by this) but feels no guilt for taking out a little old lady (who actually isn't particularly nice, and has heart troubles anyway). What makes this movie so awesome is that there are real characters, not stereotypes, and the movie is wonderfully quotable, and has that Monty Python flavor but with a true plot that viewers can hook into, even if they don't like or haven't seen Monty Python before. wonderful movie, my favorite movie ever.

    There are at least two soi-disant film comedies that are less funny than this one: Blazing Saddles and Team America. I couldn't sit all the way through either of those two, but I managed to last the distance with this one. This was due to the crude stupefaction factor, since I was curious to see what would happen next. I did not laugh, once. There seems to me nothing funny at all in a badly timed narrative about retarded criminals and idiots with speech impediments, squashed little dogs and murdered little old ladies. Nor the repulsive consumption of live goldfish, and foul-mouthed trading of cretinous insults. I struggle to think of a single witty line. The only part which was at all real was played by the actress playing John Cleese's wife: she made a number of excellent points. She could have deserved an extra star, but she wasn't funny. This script, and the performances of the rest of the highly unattractive characters, including masculine Ms Curtis, belong to the Jerry Lewis, Mel Brooks, Abbott and Costello school of comedy: go cross-eyed, splay-footed and gabble: Look, I'm being funny! What a pity it didn't end with everybody shooting themselves for incompetent failure.

    In London, four very different people team up to commit armed robbery, then try to doublecross each other for the loot. From Charles Crichton comes a comedy that is bound to have anybody who watches it laughing like a looney! No kidding, A Fish Called Wanda is a comedic gold mine, it's one of the funniest movies ever to play on the silver screen. Ranked by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 funniest movies of all time, this film backs up that distinction heavily. Before I watched the film, I did not know what I was going to expect, but when I did see the film, I laughed myself silly! For one thing, the acting in the movie is brilliant, such as John Cleese (who also wrote the screenplay), Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline (who won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and Michael Palin. and basically the rest of the cast as a whole. By the way, I heard a story in which a man from Denmark laughed himself to death while he was watching this movie, I believe I could see where he would do that, as this movie is a comedic classic! There are many scenes in the film that will have you laughing yourself nuts. For instance, any scene where Otto goes berserk because somebody called him "stupid." The scenes where Ken tries to kill Mrs. Coady (who saw the getaway and later accuses one of them of trying to murder her dogs), but accidentally ends up killing her dogs, which leaves the former stricken with grief at the idea of killing animals, as well as the parts where Otto tries to apologize to Archie for insulting him and attacking him. Kevin Kline was outstanding, he deserved the Oscar that he won. In fact, everybody in the movie was outstanding. I had previously seen John Cleese on the classic television sitcom Faulty Towers (itself very hysterical to watch), and seeing him here, he further shows that he is a master of comedy in both movies and television. This is a definitely a good way to spend an hour and 48 minutes watching. All of the good things and all of the hype that you have heard about this movie are true, as this film truly is an outstanding and absolutely hilarious comedy. If you want a comedy that has got some gargantuan laughs, then look no further, for A Fish Called Wanda is just what a movie with gargantuan laughs is, a movie with gargantuan laughs (excuse me for my redundancy, but you probably understand what I'm saying). Anyhow, if I was given the chance to watch this movie again, I would grab it at the first opportunity I got. In short, if you haven't seen this film, then you've definitely got to see it. I could see why the AFI would rank this as one of the 100 funniest movies ever made, as it truly is one of the funniest movies ever made, and it shows more proof of John Cleese's genius at comedy. Bottom line: A Fish Called Wanda is a comedic marvel, you shouldn't miss it. 10/10

This was due to the crude stupefaction factor, since I was curious to see what would happen next. I did not laugh, once. There seems to me nothing funny at all in a badly timed narrative about retarded criminals and idiots with speech impediments, squashed little dogs and murdered little old ladies. Nor the repulsive consumption of live goldfish, and foul-mouthed trading of cretinous insults. I struggle to think of a single witty line. The only part which was at all real was played by the actress playing John Cleese's wife: she made a number of excellent points. She could have deserved an extra star, but she wasn't funny. This script, and the performances of the rest of the highly unattractive characters, including masculine Ms Curtis, belong to the Jerry Lewis, Mel Brooks, Abbott and Costello school of comedy: go cross-eyed, splay-footed and gabble: Look, I'm being funny! What a pity it didn't end with everybody shooting themselves for incompetent failure.

    In London, four very different people team up to commit armed robbery, then try to doublecross each other for the loot. From Charles Crichton comes a comedy that is bound to have anybody who watches it laughing like a looney! No kidding, A Fish Called Wanda is a comedic gold mine, it's one of the funniest movies ever to play on the silver screen. Ranked by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 funniest movies of all time, this film backs up that distinction heavily. Before I watched the film, I did not know what I was going to expect, but when I did see the film, I laughed myself silly! For one thing, the acting in the movie is brilliant, such as John Cleese (who also wrote the screenplay), Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline (who won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and Michael Palin. and basically the rest of the cast as a whole. By the way, I heard a story in which a man from Denmark laughed himself to death while he was watching this movie, I believe I could see where he would do that, as this movie is a comedic classic! There are many scenes in the film that will have you laughing yourself nuts. For instance, any scene where Otto goes berserk because somebody called him "stupid." The scenes where Ken tries to kill Mrs. Coady (who saw the getaway and later accuses one of them of trying to murder her dogs), but accidentally ends up killing her dogs, which leaves the former stricken with grief at the idea of killing animals, as well as the parts where Otto tries to apologize to Archie for insulting him and attacking him. Kevin Kline was outstanding, he deserved the Oscar that he won. In fact, everybody in the movie was outstanding. I had previously seen John Cleese on the classic television sitcom Faulty Towers (itself very hysterical to watch), and seeing him here, he further shows that he is a master of comedy in both movies and television. This is a definitely a good way to spend an hour and 48 minutes watching. All of the good things and all of the hype that you have heard about this movie are true, as this film truly is an outstanding and absolutely hilarious comedy. If you want a comedy that has got some gargantuan laughs, then look no further, for A Fish Called Wanda is just what a movie with gargantuan laughs is, a movie with gargantuan laughs (excuse me for my redundancy, but you probably understand what I'm saying). Anyhow, if I was given the chance to watch this movie again, I would grab it at the first opportunity I got. In short, if you haven't seen this film, then you've definitely got to see it. I could see why the AFI would rank this as one of the 100 funniest movies ever made, as it truly is one of the funniest movies ever made, and it shows more proof of John Cleese's genius at comedy. Bottom line: A Fish Called Wanda is a comedic marvel, you shouldn't miss it. 10/10

    John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline star in A Fish Called Wanda, a film about a robbery and how the conspirators betray each other. This film has more of entertainment value to it than laugh-out-loud laughs though. That's because it contains certain jokes and/or gags that go to such extreme, that they have a shocking effect on you and you find yourself laughing more out of surprise, rather than the joke being inherently funny in itself. I won't go into all of them, but I wouldn't say being caught naked is really that funny. Kevin Kline was great though. If you can't stand foul language at all, then skip this, because Otto is a "true vulgarian." And that "Manfranjensenten" is a highlight! While I say it's not very funny, I must say it's what I call a guilty pleasure, giving in to everyone's basic urge to do what is not expected, to be uncouth, and to do what is socially unacceptable and what you can't get away with in real life. And, maybe, this is just a satire on society's norm. To make you think, like Plato. It certainly leaves a definite impression. You'll walk away, loving every minute of it or thinking you'll never see it again. But if you do, you'll have to apologize!

    it's such a complete movie you can watch it multiple times, without feeling bored of it (i must have seen it 20 times) its a lot of fun to reenact certain lines with your family and friends, when somebody says something that reminds you of it. if you like British comedy, you will agree with me :) the whole cast is absolutely brilliant and there's such chemistry between them. the jokes don't feel corny or staged, and the comedy arises from how the situations unfold/happen, not from throwing jokes at you each time i watch it, there's other things that impress me and make me laugh and a lot of lines i can recite which ads to the fun. who doesn't remember ....? :) you will choose which line i meant here, because i think everybody has their own scenes that have left their imprint on you (sheep and sweaters ha ha) of course Kevin Kline is amazing actor here and in every other role, also Jamie Lee Curtis is a very talented actress and strangely sexy and thus perfect! Michael Palin and John Cleese add the nice dry British flair to them and Maria Atken (Wendy) is perfect as the snobbish wife i didn't like George's character, but he (Tom Georgeson) really played it perfectly too, nothing against the actor! just his character in the movie Altogether, the perfect comedy!

    A Fish Called Wanda is a very good movie with a fun and simple story line,a fantastic,funny and talented cast and some great characters,and you can clearly see in the movie that it is written by one of the six Monty Python's,that being John Cleese,who in my opinion is the best of the six and has made the best career outside of Monty Python out of the other five,he has made other comedy gold,such as Fawlty Towers and this movie. Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) is using many different men,a jewel robbery (Kevin Kline),one of his henchmen (Michael Palin) and the thief's lawyer (John Cleese) to get what he wants. -DILLON HARRIS

    "It is brilliantly written, uproariously funny and goes along at a pace as fast as the crack of a whip." A lot has been said about A Fish Called Wanda, everything has been said rightly, in fact this movie deserves the accolades. The movie epitomizes the term comedy classic in every way. The film looks great too, with the cinematography skillful and striking. The story is wonderfully constructed with seldom a dull moment, while the acting is superb. Four criminals come together to pull off a daring jewel robbery. Wanda is in relationship with George; tries to get rid off him with Otto (another roberer), portrayed as Wanda's brother among the robbers. It is great fun to watch each character trying to con the other out of their share of the loot. Its hilarious to listen to K..K..Ken trrr.... too... trying to negotiate with Otto. Its funny to see Archie's relationship with Wanda develop while his relationship with his wife has almost stagnated. Whether it's John Cleese's dance, Kevin Kline's rips at England, Michael Palin's stuttering, or Jamie Lee Curtis's deadpan performance, they know how to do everything here. I can't describe how funny the movie is; you just have to see it. And you may very well die laughing - or if nothing else, you'll want to take a trip to England. Kevin Kline definitely deserved his Oscar. And of course, the cast teamed up again for another funny movie "Fierce Creatures" (not Achieved the kind of success as this movie did). So go get yourself one of the best doses of comedy of 80s My Rating  8/10

    Definitely something to watch again and again. This is one hilarious movie full of double-crossers and mix-ups. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the funny double-crosser named Wanda who has a weakness for men who speak a foreign language as a second language (preferably Italian); she flirts her way to answers by however means necessary despite her "boyfriend's" jealousy risking everything. Then there's the lovable Ken who loves animals but has a "little bit" of a stutter problem, and who can't seem to do anything right. Last but not least, the "mastermind" who seemingly got the short end of the stickor did he? Great movie, I would love to buy!

    Wanda brings her secret lover, Otto to England to help her and her lover George and stuttering animal lover Ken steal $20 million in diamonds. Wanda and Otto then turn in George to the police so they can have the loot for themselves, but George has already moved the diamonds and only he knows where they are. All four of the criminals start double-crossing each other to try to get to the diamonds before anyone else. Wanda tries to find them by "getting close" to George's barrister, Archie Leach, because if George pleads guilty he will tell Archie where the diamonds are to cut his sentence...... The thing about TV celebrities turning their hand at comedy, is always a very risqu&eacute; one. For every Wanda, we have a Wilt, True Identity, Boys In Blue, Alien Autopsy, Morons From Outer Space, Guest House Paradiso...you get the picture. The Pythons have made films like this before, but with all the garbage released in-between, one couldn't help but worry a little. The film is hilarious, from the old age comedy of the class war, to simple stuff like name calling and mocking, the film rarely takes a step wrong. Cleese is perfect as Leach, the man who has it all, except guts and happiness. This man is the epitome of middle class males, all mouth but no trousers, and Cleese gets it down to a tee. Kudos to Palin, who plays the typical working class villain with an unfortunate tick. But the film is stolen by Kline, a career best performance and really worthy of the Oscar, when ever Otto is on screen, the rest may as well sit back, they haven't a chance with Kline. It's well written, charming, funny with a little devilish streak running down its back for good measure. A perfect example of why British humour was and always be the best.

    Hardly a Monty Python vehicle, but its remnants, Cleese and Palin has brought forth perhaps their best work so far (including the python period), a contemporary satire homing in the UK/USA self-mocking kernel, with their US counterparts, Curtis and Kline. Entertaining to its very core, the crime-light, pratfall-heavy comedy ingenuously spikes British humor in its comparatively foolhardy story of a manipulative woman's happy-ever-after scheme of misappropriating all the loots from a bank robbery in her own pocket and ditching her two lovers (the sinister-looking boss she framed and the dorky, jealous, violent American criminal she could not bear anymore) with the right man (a British lawyer) she has inadvertently encountered. There are some minor cruelty in the film since dogs are consecutively and (three-times-in-a- row) inadvertently killed and fish are eaten alive (including the titular Wanda), which may faintly offend animal right activists, but apart from that, other crucial gags and set pieces are all put into the right place, nudity, awkward cuckoldry, jokes, wisecrackers, teasing of philosophy, a touch of gayness and a little bit of action, you name it! Kline's winning of BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR is such an atypical victory, by virtue of now the snubs of distinguished comedic performances have been enacted in the official mind-set of the academy and most audience's minds (last year McCarthy's nomination for BRIDESMAIDS 2011, 7/10 is flipping wondrous), and Kline is winsome as a composite of egoist, goofiness, wide- eyedness and a ludicrous perilousness. Another delicious supporting contender, Palin, stuck in his self-conscious stammer as the boss' loyal sidekick, is still capable of merciless assassination, loses all his beloved fish as a retribution of killing three innocent puppies, but equipped with a feel good revenge in the end. Curtis has extensively excavated her comedy soul, being lithely tricky, but uncompromisingly attractive. Cleese, as the authentic linchpin of the film (he is also the co-writer, co-producer and an uncredited co-director), a well-off lawyer who is smitten with Curtis from his first glance, and being salutary from the ragbag mishaps, determinedly leaves his wealthier wife and ends up with the woman he is infatuated plus the dough, an all-too-hasty coda may or may not be exonerated. A FISH CALLED WANDA is director Charles Crichton's swan-song, I rate it a venerable 8 out 10 although the film itself may fall short of my usual criterion of the "great work" category, nevertheless, we all should cherish a bit more of decent comedies which is a needle in a haystack in the present market.

    What can be said about this movie? It's so good that describing how excellent it is just can't really be put into words, but I'll give it my best shot. The best character by far is Otto, the lovable, ex-CIA agent "weapons man" who is actually dumber than dirt, yet likes to read books on philosophy (but would be better off with Dr. Seuss). Kevin Kline deserved that shiny Oscar for his portrayal of a character so painfully stupid that he has no idea how dumb he really is. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the role of the sexy American girl who seduces John Cleese in an effort to find out whether he knows where the diamonds are, but since John Cleese is stuck in a loveless marriage with an uptight, frigid bitch, he's REALLY hooked by Jamie Lee Curtis. And of course, who can forget the lovable Michael Palin as the kind-hearted animal lover with a bad stutter who has the job of "rubbing out" the little old lady but accidentally pops off her little puppies (he is heartbroken by this) but feels no guilt for taking out a little old lady (who actually isn't particularly nice, and has heart troubles anyway). What makes this movie so awesome is that there are real characters, not stereotypes, and the movie is wonderfully quotable, and has that Monty Python flavor but with a true plot that viewers can hook into, even if they don't like or haven't seen Monty Python before. wonderful movie, my favorite movie ever.

Entertaining to its very core, the crime-light, pratfall-heavy comedy ingenuously spikes British humor in its comparatively foolhardy story of a manipulative woman's happy-ever-after scheme of misappropriating all the loots from a bank robbery in her own pocket and ditching her two lovers (the sinister-looking boss she framed and the dorky, jealous, violent American criminal she could not bear anymore) with the right man (a British lawyer) she has inadvertently encountered. There are some minor cruelty in the film since dogs are consecutively and (three-times-in-a- row) inadvertently killed and fish are eaten alive (including the titular Wanda), which may faintly offend animal right activists, but apart from that, other crucial gags and set pieces are all put into the right place, nudity, awkward cuckoldry, jokes, wisecrackers, teasing of philosophy, a touch of gayness and a little bit of action, you name it! Kline's winning of BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR is such an atypical victory, by virtue of now the snubs of distinguished comedic performances have been enacted in the official mind-set of the academy and most audience's minds (last year McCarthy's nomination for BRIDESMAIDS 2011, 7/10 is flipping wondrous), and Kline is winsome as a composite of egoist, goofiness, wide- eyedness and a ludicrous perilousness. Another delicious supporting contender, Palin, stuck in his self-conscious stammer as the boss' loyal sidekick, is still capable of merciless assassination, loses all his beloved fish as a retribution of killing three innocent puppies, but equipped with a feel good revenge in the end. Curtis has extensively excavated her comedy soul, being lithely tricky, but uncompromisingly attractive. Cleese, as the authentic linchpin of the film (he is also the co-writer, co-producer and an uncredited co-director), a well-off lawyer who is smitten with Curtis from his first glance, and being salutary from the ragbag mishaps, determinedly leaves his wealthier wife and ends up with the woman he is infatuated plus the dough, an all-too-hasty coda may or may not be exonerated. A FISH CALLED WANDA is director Charles Crichton's swan-song, I rate it a venerable 8 out 10 although the film itself may fall short of my usual criterion of the "great work" category, nevertheless, we all should cherish a bit more of decent comedies which is a needle in a haystack in the present market.

    What can be said about this movie? It's so good that describing how excellent it is just can't really be put into words, but I'll give it my best shot. The best character by far is Otto, the lovable, ex-CIA agent "weapons man" who is actually dumber than dirt, yet likes to read books on philosophy (but would be better off with Dr. Seuss). Kevin Kline deserved that shiny Oscar for his portrayal of a character so painfully stupid that he has no idea how dumb he really is. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the role of the sexy American girl who seduces John Cleese in an effort to find out whether he knows where the diamonds are, but since John Cleese is stuck in a loveless marriage with an uptight, frigid bitch, he's REALLY hooked by Jamie Lee Curtis. And of course, who can forget the lovable Michael Palin as the kind-hearted animal lover with a bad stutter who has the job of "rubbing out" the little old lady but accidentally pops off her little puppies (he is heartbroken by this) but feels no guilt for taking out a little old lady (who actually isn't particularly nice, and has heart troubles anyway). What makes this movie so awesome is that there are real characters, not stereotypes, and the movie is wonderfully quotable, and has that Monty Python flavor but with a true plot that viewers can hook into, even if they don't like or haven't seen Monty Python before. wonderful movie, my favorite movie ever.

    There are at least two soi-disant film comedies that are less funny than this one: Blazing Saddles and Team America. I couldn't sit all the way through either of those two, but I managed to last the distance with this one. This was due to the crude stupefaction factor, since I was curious to see what would happen next. I did not laugh, once. There seems to me nothing funny at all in a badly timed narrative about retarded criminals and idiots with speech impediments, squashed little dogs and murdered little old ladies. Nor the repulsive consumption of live goldfish, and foul-mouthed trading of cretinous insults. I struggle to think of a single witty line. The only part which was at all real was played by the actress playing John Cleese's wife: she made a number of excellent points. She could have deserved an extra star, but she wasn't funny. This script, and the performances of the rest of the highly unattractive characters, including masculine Ms Curtis, belong to the Jerry Lewis, Mel Brooks, Abbott and Costello school of comedy: go cross-eyed, splay-footed and gabble: Look, I'm being funny! What a pity it didn't end with everybody shooting themselves for incompetent failure.

    In London, four very different people team up to commit armed robbery, then try to doublecross each other for the loot. From Charles Crichton comes a comedy that is bound to have anybody who watches it laughing like a looney! No kidding, A Fish Called Wanda is a comedic gold mine, it's one of the funniest movies ever to play on the silver screen. Ranked by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 funniest movies of all time, this film backs up that distinction heavily. Before I watched the film, I did not know what I was going to expect, but when I did see the film, I laughed myself silly! For one thing, the acting in the movie is brilliant, such as John Cleese (who also wrote the screenplay), Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline (who won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), and Michael Palin. and basically the rest of the cast as a whole. By the way, I heard a story in which a man from Denmark laughed himself to death while he was watching this movie, I believe I could see where he would do that, as this movie is a comedic classic! There are many scenes in the film that will have you laughing yourself nuts. For instance, any scene where Otto goes berserk because somebody called him "stupid." The scenes where Ken tries to kill Mrs. Coady (who saw the getaway and later accuses one of them of trying to murder her dogs), but accidentally ends up killing her dogs, which leaves the former stricken with grief at the idea of killing animals, as well as the parts where Otto tries to apologize to Archie for insulting him and attacking him. Kevin Kline was outstanding, he deserved the Oscar that he won. In fact, everybody in the movie was outstanding. I had previously seen John Cleese on the classic television sitcom Faulty Towers (itself very hysterical to watch), and seeing him here, he further shows that he is a master of comedy in both movies and television. This is a definitely a good way to spend an hour and 48 minutes watching. All of the good things and all of the hype that you have heard about this movie are true, as this film truly is an outstanding and absolutely hilarious comedy. If you want a comedy that has got some gargantuan laughs, then look no further, for A Fish Called Wanda is just what a movie with gargantuan laughs is, a movie with gargantuan laughs (excuse me for my redundancy, but you probably understand what I'm saying). Anyhow, if I was given the chance to watch this movie again, I would grab it at the first opportunity I got. In short, if you haven't seen this film, then you've definitely got to see it. I could see why the AFI would rank this as one of the 100 funniest movies ever made, as it truly is one of the funniest movies ever made, and it shows more proof of John Cleese's genius at comedy. Bottom line: A Fish Called Wanda is a comedic marvel, you shouldn't miss it. 10/10

    John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline star in A Fish Called Wanda, a film about a robbery and how the conspirators betray each other. This film has more of entertainment value to it than laugh-out-loud laughs though. That's because it contains certain jokes and/or gags that go to such extreme, that they have a shocking effect on you and you find yourself laughing more out of surprise, rather than the joke being inherently funny in itself. I won't go into all of them, but I wouldn't say being caught naked is really that funny. Kevin Kline was great though. If you can't stand foul language at all, then skip this, because Otto is a "true vulgarian." And that "Manfranjensenten" is a highlight! While I say it's not very funny, I must say it's what I call a guilty pleasure, giving in to everyone's basic urge to do what is not expected, to be uncouth, and to do what is socially unacceptable and what you can't get away with in real life. And, maybe, this is just a satire on society's norm. To make you think, like Plato. It certainly leaves a definite impression. You'll walk away, loving every minute of it or thinking you'll never see it again. But if you do, you'll have to apologize!

    it's such a complete movie you can watch it multiple times, without feeling bored of it (i must have seen it 20 times) its a lot of fun to reenact certain lines with your family and friends, when somebody says something that reminds you of it. if you like British comedy, you will agree with me :) the whole cast is absolutely brilliant and there's such chemistry between them. the jokes don't feel corny or staged, and the comedy arises from how the situations unfold/happen, not from throwing jokes at you each time i watch it, there's other things that impress me and make me laugh and a lot of lines i can recite which ads to the fun. who doesn't remember ....? :) you will choose which line i meant here, because i think everybody has their own scenes that have left their imprint on you (sheep and sweaters ha ha) of course Kevin Kline is amazing actor here and in every other role, also Jamie Lee Curtis is a very talented actress and strangely sexy and thus perfect! Michael Palin and John Cleese add the nice dry British flair to them and Maria Atken (Wendy) is perfect as the snobbish wife i didn't like George's character, but he (Tom Georgeson) really played it perfectly too, nothing against the actor! just his character in the movie Altogether, the perfect comedy!

    A Fish Called Wanda is a very good movie with a fun and simple story line,a fantastic,funny and talented cast and some great characters,and you can clearly see in the movie that it is written by one of the six Monty Python's,that being John Cleese,who in my opinion is the best of the six and has made the best career outside of Monty Python out of the other five,he has made other comedy gold,such as Fawlty Towers and this movie. Wanda (Jamie Lee Curtis) is using many different men,a jewel robbery (Kevin Kline),one of his henchmen (Michael Palin) and the thief's lawyer (John Cleese) to get what he wants. -DILLON HARRIS

    "It is brilliantly written, uproariously funny and goes along at a pace as fast as the crack of a whip." A lot has been said about A Fish Called Wanda, everything has been said rightly, in fact this movie deserves the accolades. The movie epitomizes the term comedy classic in every way. The film looks great too, with the cinematography skillful and striking. The story is wonderfully constructed with seldom a dull moment, while the acting is superb. Four criminals come together to pull off a daring jewel robbery. Wanda is in relationship with George; tries to get rid off him with Otto (another roberer), portrayed as Wanda's brother among the robbers. It is great fun to watch each character trying to con the other out of their share of the loot. Its hilarious to listen to K..K..Ken trrr.... too... trying to negotiate with Otto. Its funny to see Archie's relationship with Wanda develop while his relationship with his wife has almost stagnated. Whether it's John Cleese's dance, Kevin Kline's rips at England, Michael Palin's stuttering, or Jamie Lee Curtis's deadpan performance, they know how to do everything here. I can't describe how funny the movie is; you just have to see it. And you may very well die laughing - or if nothing else, you'll want to take a trip to England. Kevin Kline definitely deserved his Oscar. And of course, the cast teamed up again for another funny movie "Fierce Creatures" (not Achieved the kind of success as this movie did). So go get yourself one of the best doses of comedy of 80s My Rating  8/10

    Definitely something to watch again and again. This is one hilarious movie full of double-crossers and mix-ups. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the funny double-crosser named Wanda who has a weakness for men who speak a foreign language as a second language (preferably Italian); she flirts her way to answers by however means necessary despite her "boyfriend's" jealousy risking everything. Then there's the lovable Ken who loves animals but has a "little bit" of a stutter problem, and who can't seem to do anything right. Last but not least, the "mastermind" who seemingly got the short end of the stickor did he? Great movie, I would love to buy!

    Wanda brings her secret lover, Otto to England to help her and her lover George and stuttering animal lover Ken steal $20 million in diamonds. Wanda and Otto then turn in George to the police so they can have the loot for themselves, but George has already moved the diamonds and only he knows where they are. All four of the criminals start double-crossing each other to try to get to the diamonds before anyone else. Wanda tries to find them by "getting close" to George's barrister, Archie Leach, because if George pleads guilty he will tell Archie where the diamonds are to cut his sentence...... The thing about TV celebrities turning their hand at comedy, is always a very risqu&eacute; one. For every Wanda, we have a Wilt, True Identity, Boys In Blue, Alien Autopsy, Morons From Outer Space, Guest House Paradiso...you get the picture. The Pythons have made films like this before, but with all the garbage released in-between, one couldn't help but worry a little. The film is hilarious, from the old age comedy of the class war, to simple stuff like name calling and mocking, the film rarely takes a step wrong. Cleese is perfect as Leach, the man who has it all, except guts and happiness. This man is the epitome of middle class males, all mouth but no trousers, and Cleese gets it down to a tee. Kudos to Palin, who plays the typical working class villain with an unfortunate tick. But the film is stolen by Kline, a career best performance and really worthy of the Oscar, when ever Otto is on screen, the rest may as well sit back, they haven't a chance with Kline. It's well written, charming, funny with a little devilish streak running down its back for good measure. A perfect example of why British humour was and always be the best.
