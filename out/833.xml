    This has to be one of the worst movies I ever saw. I should have known by it's release date - September - I was in for less than a treat. That's after all of the summer blockbusters have been released and before the academy award possibilities start cropping up in October/November. And remember, 1996 was the year that the word "blockbuster" was defined by unwatchable schlock such as Independence Day and Twister. Jack Keats (Damon Wayons) is an undercover cop posing as a car thief in order to get information from a real car thief, Archie Moses (Adam Sandler). The two have actually developed a kind of friendship during the time they are working together. After gaining his trust, Moses offers to introduce Keats to his boss, drug kingpin Frank Colton (James Caan). Keats jumps at the chance to home in on bigger criminal game. Thus as Keats is meeting Colton for the first time, the police appear on the scene to make their arrests in the case. In the resulting chaos, Keats is shot in the head. Keats has a slow but sure recovery. On the bright side, he falls in love with the woman who helps him recover. On the negative side, he now has a metal plate in his head. Afterwards, when he is back on duty, Keats is assigned to escort Moses back to testify against his former employer Colton, a situation neither one is looking forward to. Keats is angry because thanks to Moses he has a metal plate in his head, and Moses is angry because Keats lied to him over the entire year that he thought they were friends and colleagues. This movie seems to be going for the buddy/road film angle, with the exception of the fact that Keats and Moses run into a series of attempts on their lives since Colton, the big drug kingpin, is out to kill them both. This forces them to work together to figure out why their every move seems to be known by Colton before they even make it. Both Wayans and Sandler can be very funny if given the right material, but neither has anything particularly funny to do or say here, since the material they are working with is totally lacking in the imagination and genuine humor that could have exploited the talents of the two leading men. Avoid at all cost. The only reason I remember this movie over ten years later is (a) it is incredibly bad even for a "man movie" and (b) my husband insisted we go see it.

    Watching the new disposable Ernest Dickerson action-comedy "Bulletproof," a cops and robbers buddy picture with Damon Wayans and Adam Sandler as the buds, is like munching great junk food. You know it isn't what you should be eating. Nevertheless, it smells delicious and makes you smack your lips together when you chew. The action scenes, when the bad guys (sometimes even the good guys) get the cream puffs kicked out of them, contain a lot of crunch. The crude-oil "Saturday Night Live" comic scenes, which only anal retentive Neanderthals would savor as instructive, are uproariously self-effacing. Serious film genre scholars may give an appreciative nod to "Bulletproof" simply because it triggers happier memories from classic action pictures, such as Clint Eastwood's "The Gauntlet" (1977), Sam Peckinpah's "The Killer Elite" (1974), and the 1958 Tony Curtis & Sidney Poitier version of "The Defiant Ones." Nobody but the average moviegoers who really knows the two perquisite words in movie-goingfun and fakewill truly appreciate this potboiler of a melodrama, with comedy tosses in a spice, for what it aspires to be. The corpses pile up as fast as the clich&eacute;s in the derivative Joe Gayton and Lewis Colick screenplay. As Detective Keats, Damon Wayans is cast as an undercover cop who convinces Moses (Adam Sandler's dopey but likable criminal blunder brain) that he is his best friend. The trouble begins when Keats bonds a little too well with Moses. Keats feels personally committed to bringing Moses in alive and well. When they try to reel in the kingpin mobster, a wealthy used car salesman played with gleeful abandon by James Caan of "The Godfather." Keats concerns himself more Moses' welfare than the bust. In a weird "Pulp Fiction" torque of events, Moses shoots Keats in the head but neither kills nor cripples him. Moses freaks out, leaves for Mexico, with his pooch (one of those magpie-looking Spuds McKenzie types) to become a bullfighter. The law catches up with Moses, and he agrees to testify against his boss (James Caan) on the condition that Keats serve as his bodyguard. Although Damon Wayans is a truly gifted comic, he could take lessons from his brother Keenen Ivory about playing beefy, tough-guys. Damon acts more like his "Major Payne" character here when he should have used his rugged quarterback hero from "The Last Boy Scout." He is a cheese cake action hero here. But it is fun to watch the antics of Wayans and Sandler (a foul-mouthed, 1950s' era Jerry Lewis wannabe) as they blunder through a series of impossible obstacles. The filmmakers serve up seemingly non-stop action like a Saturday Morning television cartoon. They plunge our bulletproof heroes into several unreal but really predictable predicaments. Eventually, the action brings our buddies to the big shoot'em up in James Caan's palatial residence and at least one surprise. If you figure out that surprise before the Dickerson and company reveal it, you have obviously gone into the wrong theater. "Juice" director Dickerson got his start as a cinematographer for Spike Lee in epics such as "Do The Right Thing," makes "Bulletproof" look more visually slick and sophisticate than it deserves to be considering how imitative it remains. Each shot contains imaginative compositional elements that you won't be able to savor on a small screen. The lighting is extremely well-done. Actor James Farentino, who plays Wayan's sinister police department superior, is lighted so evocatively that he appears suspicious. Dickerson's big problem here is that the headlong action must break intermittently at all comedy stops. "Bulletproof" employs comedy to insulate its audiences from the effect of thinking too much about the wildly improbable scenes of simulated violence that recur throughout the film. After somebody gets iced, a joke is delivered to make you forget that they've been killed or, in the case of our heroes, escaped certain death. James Caan indulges himself as the used car salesman drug lord. In one scene, he removes his toupee so it won't get dirty during a showdown with Wayans. Caan gives his villainy the appropriate inflection for the kind of hokum that pads out "Bulletproof." He is nowhere near the bastard that he was in the Arnold Schwarzenegger thriller "Eraser." The usual quota of souped-up car chases, gunfights, and four-letter oaths ought to delight hardcore action fans, but they may miss the more amorous matings that occur in the more dramatic male sagas. Composer Elmer Bernstein enhances the super-charged action scenes with some humming, hipster-cool incidental music, especially in the introductory urban car chase scene. "Bulletproof" is definitely no classic, but it has its share of entertaining moments.

    Rock Keats and Archie Moses are best friends and have spent the past year together performing various small time crimes. This all changes when they become involved in a major drug smuggling operation. Rock Keats turns out to be Jack Carter, an undercover police officer and tries to arrest Moses during a failed attempt to catch criminal mastermind Frank Colton. However, Moses ends up shooting Carter and makes an escape. Moses is later caught and agrees to turn state's evidence on Colton with one condition, Carter escorts him in. When they meet, both are bitter towards each other. Unknown to them, Colton's men have orders to take out Moses and arrive to shoot down the transport plane. Carter and Moses end up by themselves in the countryside with Colton's men closing in......... Back in 1996, Wayans was bigger than Sandler, but it was already changing, Wayans had a string of flops and Sandler had just done Billy Madison. Wayans got top billing, and this is probably why it flopped big time. But it's a really fun easy going movie at a running time that couldn't offend anybody. It a load of old cobblers plot wise, and the buddy buddy thing was dying a death, but the two leads are amiable enough and Caan wasn't too bad as the villain. It's not very memorable though, and it's full of clich&eacute;s, but for Sandler fans and Wayans fans, this will suffice.

    Another one of Sandler movies with the same verdict for me: okay for Television but not good enough for cinema or worthy to spend money on for DVD. The beginning is quite entertaining and then it develops into a much too predictable movie, with the ending being most typical of Adam Sandler. It is however fairly entertaining to see but only if you have limited cinema/film experience like I did when I first saw it (I must have been about 15 when I staggered upon it on Television). However, once I began to really see cinematographic masterpieces, movies such as these are a pure embarrassment to cinema and should really not be funded. x

    Bulletproof (1996) *** (out of 4) After agreeing to testify against a drug lord (James Caan), lowlife Moses (Adam Sandler) ends up with the undercover cop (Damon Wayans) that originally busted him. The two end up out on the road with hit men and dirty cops after them trying to make sure Moses can't get to court but the biggest threat for the two men are each other. If you're looking for a smart and intelligent film then you're not going to find it here but if you're just looking for a good time then the two stars really deliver. There's no question that this is a "B" movie as there's nothing ground-breaking here and you're not going to have your life changed in any way, shape or form. BULLETPROOF has a simple plot that's just meant to give the two stars something to work their magic with. I think the strongest point of the film are its two stars because they share some terrific chemistry and really take the material and do something special with it. The majority of the humor is silly R-rated stuff like porn jokes, urine jokes and other things like that but the way Wayans and Sandler sells it makes it funny. There are some hilarious moments here including a Disneyland joke early in the picture and the constant banter between the two really works well. The two actors really make you believe their characters and this allows the situation to be funny and especially in the scenes where Wayans pretty much abuses Sandler over the issue that happened at the start of the film. Caan is pretty much just being himself and picking up a paycheck but he's always worth watching and it's fun to see him here. BULLETPROOF also contains some fun action scenes, is well-directed and really just delivers nice laughs.

    I actually wanted to like Bulletproof, despite my general dislike for Adam Sandler, because I like buddy movies and James Caan is a great actor. I give Bulletproof some credit for some slickly shot shoot-out sequences, but other than that everything else feels wrong to me. When I think of a good buddy movie, I think of likable characters, juicy dialogue to savour and some dynamicism in the action sequences. Some people watching Bulletproof may find these things, and I do respect that, however for me what I found here was the complete opposite on all counts. I really didn't care for any of the characters, finding them clich&eacute;d and annoying, especially Sandler's character. In fact, I found myself rooting more for the villains, but wished there was more to them. Bulletproof just wasn't funny to me either, I love action movies with comedy when it is good, but apart from one or two mildly amusing parts the dialogue was corny and the jokes rather tasteless. There is nothing dynamic about the action sequences, they may be slickly shot but the way they are choreographed at times is inept and the complete lack of subtlety in the violence leaves a bad taste in the mouth afterwards. The story is predictable with very little coming across as truly thrilling, while all the performances fall flat. Sandler has definitely done worse and more irritating performances, but his performance consists of near-unintelligible mumbling and I found myself annoyed by his character right from the start. Damon Wayans fares better, having more charisma, but the dialogue is so lame, the chemistry between him and Sandler so forced and the character so clich&eacute;d, it comes across as a wasted effort. James Caan is a great actor, but the first thought that came into my head after finishing Bulletproof was, what on earth was he doing here? He tried, but deserved so much better. Overall, a movie I wanted to like, but apart from one or two small things it didn't deliver. 1/10 Bethany Cox

    This movie is about friendship and betrayal. Both of the major characters in this movie are betrayed by their closest friends, and come to understand what it is really like to be betrayed. One of them is an undercover cop while the other is a criminal, but also quite timid, but has joined forces, and then earned the emnity, of a major drug lord. The movie opens with the cop and Archie Moses as best friends stealing a car, but we quickly learn that the cop is an undercover cop who is trying to bust a drug dealer who owns a huge car dealership. Moses then brings the cop to the factory and it is discovered that he is a cop and the police raid the place. The cop wants to protected Archie, but due to an accident, Archie shoots him in the head. Months later, the cop has fallen in love with his therapist and Archie is running from the drug lord. He is found by the police but requests that this cop return and escort him back. There isn't much to say about this movie other than how they begin as best friends, but after the truth is revealed, Archie cannot trust him anymore. The cop in upset because Archie shot him, but does not want to believe that it was an accident. We also know that somebody else is tipping them off, but we do not know who, but the movie is about the friend's betrayal, and is summed up in Archie's comment to the cop, "now you know how it feels to be betrayed by a friend." The drug lord is interesting because he also owns a used car yard and we always see his advertisement on television. It is as if this guy is flaunting himself in front of everybody, and those who know the truth about him are frustrated because they cannot get at him. Archie has the evidence, but the guy wants Archie dead because of his relationship with the cop. This is not a bad movie, but Adam Sandler has done far better. It is not really a comedy, more of an action movie, and though Sandler does act weirdly, this movie does not stand out in my opinion.

    This is interesting case. The thrillers with 2 totally discordant partners are quite familiar since the start of the 1980s. The formula got (Lethal Weapon) in 1987, then the sequel in 1989, where the sense of comedy was so lucid, as semi-iconic example for the buddy movie which was all over the place during that era. Once we've had 2 actors whom can do comedy (Lethal Weapon), one actor and one comedian (48 Hours), one actor to be comic and one comedian to act (Midnight Run), or 2 comedians yet into comedy (Dragnet). Here, despite how poor the atmosphere was, the main problem remains in casting strangely 2 "comic" tiny stars, at the time, to be the lead of what supposed to be a thriller. And the personality of the movie went wrong since that. You can't settle.. Is that a slapstick comedy, or a violent thriller ?? I was really sad because of the potentials of this hot plot, they're totally wasted. Despite the efforts (Damon Waynes) with the beard made to look serious but sorry that was in the wrong place, he was mostly cool but everything wasn't. (Adam Sandler) looked tepid or slack and relied only on his funny charisma to do the whole thing for him. (James Cann) must've needed money hard, but not to wonder because after watching him in (Alien Nation - 1988) I became convinced that I can see him in anything ! At least he had not much to do. Furthermore, some slight provocative moments: (Waynes) and (Sandler) escape from the police station after threatening the whole department so dozens of policemen run after them, and THEN they're both enjoying their time in a strip club !!?? There is some excessive buffoonery also, to have that tense between being a comedy and a thriller. The direction is idealistically not cinematic, handling the mission like a TV episode, or a sitcom.. A boring serious one too. All the scenes suffered of zero budget so the word poor came with so many meanings here. Look at the deadly climax (shame to call it one in the first place) to know exactly what I mean. Basically there are better straight-to-video movies than this one ! (Kristen Wilson) was the only "pretty" thing in here yet as the plot's potentials both were lost. So it's the case of a thriller comedy which having the comedians as Action heroes, with destitute action, and even off-color comedy ! It is interesting indeed as a perfect type for a formula with a disorder. It could've been good though, but in another movie. Generally, I can be wrong to say that it wasn't entertaining, but I can be fair to say it was lowly entertaining.

    Drug runner Archie Moses introduces his friend Rock Keats to his boss, drug kingpin Frank Colton. Unknown to Moses, Keats is actually an undercover police officer. During the bust on Colton's factory, Moses accidentally shoots Keats in the head. He survives the wound & later arrests Moses. Dodging Colton's hired assassins, the duo must overcome their mutual hatred to survive. Adam Sandler's films are usually a hit-&-miss affair, with his comedies either loved by his fans or hated by everyone. This one is not as stupid as his other films, but still cannot overcome a lazy script. The direction is incredibly patchy, with fast-paced action sequences giving way to slow comic exchanges between Sandler & Damon Wayans. Some of the action scenes  flying a plane with no engines, a car chase at night through a forest  are quite absurdly contrived. The acting is the standard for this genre, with Sandler & Wayans making a good pairing. In short, the film is dumb but fun to watch. Grade: C+ Review by M. K. Geist

    This movie was hilarious. i don't know how come it's got such a low rating. It's a comedy, it's not supposed to make you think about the meaning of life, but to make you laugh. And if you didn't laugh watching it..you have some serious problems..Or you are more than 75 and shouldn't watch it cuz u might get a heart attack . Anyway, besides Adam Sandler, the dog does an excellent job, especially at playing drunk when Adam Sandler gets busted by the cops on the highway. It's not as stupid as waterboy, Sandler doesn't act that stupid. It might actually be my favorite Adam Sandler movie, but it still has to compete with Anger Management and Happy Gilmore. And if we can rule out Happy Gilmore, Anger Management is another freaking hilarious movie.. Difficult choice. But i recommend it to every Adam Sandler fan who hasn't seen it yet. And to everybody else that enjoys a good laugh. If you can't laugh, don't bother to register and vote. You'll ruin it.

    Rock Keats and Archie Moses are best friends and have spent the past year together performing various small time crimes. This all changes when they become involved in a major drug smuggling operation. Rock Keats turns out to be Jack Carter, an undercover police officer and tries to arrest Moses during a failed attempt to catch criminal mastermind Frank Colton. However, Moses ends up shooting Carter and makes an escape. Moses is later caught and agrees to turn state's evidence on Colton with one condition, Carter escorts him in. When they meet, both are bitter towards each other. Unknown to them, Colton's men have orders to take out Moses and arrive to shoot down the transport plane. Carter and Moses end up by themselves in the countryside with Colton's men closing in......... Back in 1996, Wayans was bigger than Sandler, but it was already changing, Wayans had a string of flops and Sandler had just done Billy Madison. Wayans got top billing, and this is probably why it flopped big time. But it's a really fun easy going movie at a running time that couldn't offend anybody. It a load of old cobblers plot wise, and the buddy buddy thing was dying a death, but the two leads are amiable enough and Caan wasn't too bad as the villain. It's not very memorable though, and it's full of clich&eacute;s, but for Sandler fans and Wayans fans, this will suffice.

    Another one of Sandler movies with the same verdict for me: okay for Television but not good enough for cinema or worthy to spend money on for DVD. The beginning is quite entertaining and then it develops into a much too predictable movie, with the ending being most typical of Adam Sandler. It is however fairly entertaining to see but only if you have limited cinema/film experience like I did when I first saw it (I must have been about 15 when I staggered upon it on Television). However, once I began to really see cinematographic masterpieces, movies such as these are a pure embarrassment to cinema and should really not be funded. x

    Bulletproof (1996) *** (out of 4) After agreeing to testify against a drug lord (James Caan), lowlife Moses (Adam Sandler) ends up with the undercover cop (Damon Wayans) that originally busted him. The two end up out on the road with hit men and dirty cops after them trying to make sure Moses can't get to court but the biggest threat for the two men are each other. If you're looking for a smart and intelligent film then you're not going to find it here but if you're just looking for a good time then the two stars really deliver. There's no question that this is a "B" movie as there's nothing ground-breaking here and you're not going to have your life changed in any way, shape or form. BULLETPROOF has a simple plot that's just meant to give the two stars something to work their magic with. I think the strongest point of the film are its two stars because they share some terrific chemistry and really take the material and do something special with it. The majority of the humor is silly R-rated stuff like porn jokes, urine jokes and other things like that but the way Wayans and Sandler sells it makes it funny. There are some hilarious moments here including a Disneyland joke early in the picture and the constant banter between the two really works well. The two actors really make you believe their characters and this allows the situation to be funny and especially in the scenes where Wayans pretty much abuses Sandler over the issue that happened at the start of the film. Caan is pretty much just being himself and picking up a paycheck but he's always worth watching and it's fun to see him here. BULLETPROOF also contains some fun action scenes, is well-directed and really just delivers nice laughs.

    I actually wanted to like Bulletproof, despite my general dislike for Adam Sandler, because I like buddy movies and James Caan is a great actor. I give Bulletproof some credit for some slickly shot shoot-out sequences, but other than that everything else feels wrong to me. When I think of a good buddy movie, I think of likable characters, juicy dialogue to savour and some dynamicism in the action sequences. Some people watching Bulletproof may find these things, and I do respect that, however for me what I found here was the complete opposite on all counts. I really didn't care for any of the characters, finding them clich&eacute;d and annoying, especially Sandler's character. In fact, I found myself rooting more for the villains, but wished there was more to them. Bulletproof just wasn't funny to me either, I love action movies with comedy when it is good, but apart from one or two mildly amusing parts the dialogue was corny and the jokes rather tasteless. There is nothing dynamic about the action sequences, they may be slickly shot but the way they are choreographed at times is inept and the complete lack of subtlety in the violence leaves a bad taste in the mouth afterwards. The story is predictable with very little coming across as truly thrilling, while all the performances fall flat. Sandler has definitely done worse and more irritating performances, but his performance consists of near-unintelligible mumbling and I found myself annoyed by his character right from the start. Damon Wayans fares better, having more charisma, but the dialogue is so lame, the chemistry between him and Sandler so forced and the character so clich&eacute;d, it comes across as a wasted effort. James Caan is a great actor, but the first thought that came into my head after finishing Bulletproof was, what on earth was he doing here? He tried, but deserved so much better. Overall, a movie I wanted to like, but apart from one or two small things it didn't deliver. 1/10 Bethany Cox

    This movie is about friendship and betrayal. Both of the major characters in this movie are betrayed by their closest friends, and come to understand what it is really like to be betrayed. One of them is an undercover cop while the other is a criminal, but also quite timid, but has joined forces, and then earned the emnity, of a major drug lord. The movie opens with the cop and Archie Moses as best friends stealing a car, but we quickly learn that the cop is an undercover cop who is trying to bust a drug dealer who owns a huge car dealership. Moses then brings the cop to the factory and it is discovered that he is a cop and the police raid the place. The cop wants to protected Archie, but due to an accident, Archie shoots him in the head. Months later, the cop has fallen in love with his therapist and Archie is running from the drug lord. He is found by the police but requests that this cop return and escort him back. There isn't much to say about this movie other than how they begin as best friends, but after the truth is revealed, Archie cannot trust him anymore. The cop in upset because Archie shot him, but does not want to believe that it was an accident. We also know that somebody else is tipping them off, but we do not know who, but the movie is about the friend's betrayal, and is summed up in Archie's comment to the cop, "now you know how it feels to be betrayed by a friend." The drug lord is interesting because he also owns a used car yard and we always see his advertisement on television. It is as if this guy is flaunting himself in front of everybody, and those who know the truth about him are frustrated because they cannot get at him. Archie has the evidence, but the guy wants Archie dead because of his relationship with the cop. This is not a bad movie, but Adam Sandler has done far better. It is not really a comedy, more of an action movie, and though Sandler does act weirdly, this movie does not stand out in my opinion.

    This is interesting case. The thrillers with 2 totally discordant partners are quite familiar since the start of the 1980s. The formula got (Lethal Weapon) in 1987, then the sequel in 1989, where the sense of comedy was so lucid, as semi-iconic example for the buddy movie which was all over the place during that era. Once we've had 2 actors whom can do comedy (Lethal Weapon), one actor and one comedian (48 Hours), one actor to be comic and one comedian to act (Midnight Run), or 2 comedians yet into comedy (Dragnet). Here, despite how poor the atmosphere was, the main problem remains in casting strangely 2 "comic" tiny stars, at the time, to be the lead of what supposed to be a thriller. And the personality of the movie went wrong since that. You can't settle.. Is that a slapstick comedy, or a violent thriller ?? I was really sad because of the potentials of this hot plot, they're totally wasted. Despite the efforts (Damon Waynes) with the beard made to look serious but sorry that was in the wrong place, he was mostly cool but everything wasn't. (Adam Sandler) looked tepid or slack and relied only on his funny charisma to do the whole thing for him. (James Cann) must've needed money hard, but not to wonder because after watching him in (Alien Nation - 1988) I became convinced that I can see him in anything ! At least he had not much to do. Furthermore, some slight provocative moments: (Waynes) and (Sandler) escape from the police station after threatening the whole department so dozens of policemen run after them, and THEN they're both enjoying their time in a strip club !!?? There is some excessive buffoonery also, to have that tense between being a comedy and a thriller. The direction is idealistically not cinematic, handling the mission like a TV episode, or a sitcom.. A boring serious one too. All the scenes suffered of zero budget so the word poor came with so many meanings here. Look at the deadly climax (shame to call it one in the first place) to know exactly what I mean. Basically there are better straight-to-video movies than this one ! (Kristen Wilson) was the only "pretty" thing in here yet as the plot's potentials both were lost. So it's the case of a thriller comedy which having the comedians as Action heroes, with destitute action, and even off-color comedy ! It is interesting indeed as a perfect type for a formula with a disorder. It could've been good though, but in another movie. Generally, I can be wrong to say that it wasn't entertaining, but I can be fair to say it was lowly entertaining.

    Drug runner Archie Moses introduces his friend Rock Keats to his boss, drug kingpin Frank Colton. Unknown to Moses, Keats is actually an undercover police officer. During the bust on Colton's factory, Moses accidentally shoots Keats in the head. He survives the wound & later arrests Moses. Dodging Colton's hired assassins, the duo must overcome their mutual hatred to survive. Adam Sandler's films are usually a hit-&-miss affair, with his comedies either loved by his fans or hated by everyone. This one is not as stupid as his other films, but still cannot overcome a lazy script. The direction is incredibly patchy, with fast-paced action sequences giving way to slow comic exchanges between Sandler & Damon Wayans. Some of the action scenes  flying a plane with no engines, a car chase at night through a forest  are quite absurdly contrived. The acting is the standard for this genre, with Sandler & Wayans making a good pairing. In short, the film is dumb but fun to watch. Grade: C+ Review by M. K. Geist

    This movie was hilarious. i don't know how come it's got such a low rating. It's a comedy, it's not supposed to make you think about the meaning of life, but to make you laugh. And if you didn't laugh watching it..you have some serious problems..Or you are more than 75 and shouldn't watch it cuz u might get a heart attack . Anyway, besides Adam Sandler, the dog does an excellent job, especially at playing drunk when Adam Sandler gets busted by the cops on the highway. It's not as stupid as waterboy, Sandler doesn't act that stupid. It might actually be my favorite Adam Sandler movie, but it still has to compete with Anger Management and Happy Gilmore. And if we can rule out Happy Gilmore, Anger Management is another freaking hilarious movie.. Difficult choice. But i recommend it to every Adam Sandler fan who hasn't seen it yet. And to everybody else that enjoys a good laugh. If you can't laugh, don't bother to register and vote. You'll ruin it.

    This has to be one of the worst movies I ever saw. I should have known by it's release date - September - I was in for less than a treat. That's after all of the summer blockbusters have been released and before the academy award possibilities start cropping up in October/November. And remember, 1996 was the year that the word "blockbuster" was defined by unwatchable schlock such as Independence Day and Twister. Jack Keats (Damon Wayons) is an undercover cop posing as a car thief in order to get information from a real car thief, Archie Moses (Adam Sandler). The two have actually developed a kind of friendship during the time they are working together. After gaining his trust, Moses offers to introduce Keats to his boss, drug kingpin Frank Colton (James Caan). Keats jumps at the chance to home in on bigger criminal game. Thus as Keats is meeting Colton for the first time, the police appear on the scene to make their arrests in the case. In the resulting chaos, Keats is shot in the head. Keats has a slow but sure recovery. On the bright side, he falls in love with the woman who helps him recover. On the negative side, he now has a metal plate in his head. Afterwards, when he is back on duty, Keats is assigned to escort Moses back to testify against his former employer Colton, a situation neither one is looking forward to. Keats is angry because thanks to Moses he has a metal plate in his head, and Moses is angry because Keats lied to him over the entire year that he thought they were friends and colleagues. This movie seems to be going for the buddy/road film angle, with the exception of the fact that Keats and Moses run into a series of attempts on their lives since Colton, the big drug kingpin, is out to kill them both. This forces them to work together to figure out why their every move seems to be known by Colton before they even make it. Both Wayans and Sandler can be very funny if given the right material, but neither has anything particularly funny to do or say here, since the material they are working with is totally lacking in the imagination and genuine humor that could have exploited the talents of the two leading men. Avoid at all cost. The only reason I remember this movie over ten years later is (a) it is incredibly bad even for a "man movie" and (b) my husband insisted we go see it.

    Watching the new disposable Ernest Dickerson action-comedy "Bulletproof," a cops and robbers buddy picture with Damon Wayans and Adam Sandler as the buds, is like munching great junk food. You know it isn't what you should be eating. Nevertheless, it smells delicious and makes you smack your lips together when you chew. The action scenes, when the bad guys (sometimes even the good guys) get the cream puffs kicked out of them, contain a lot of crunch. The crude-oil "Saturday Night Live" comic scenes, which only anal retentive Neanderthals would savor as instructive, are uproariously self-effacing. Serious film genre scholars may give an appreciative nod to "Bulletproof" simply because it triggers happier memories from classic action pictures, such as Clint Eastwood's "The Gauntlet" (1977), Sam Peckinpah's "The Killer Elite" (1974), and the 1958 Tony Curtis & Sidney Poitier version of "The Defiant Ones." Nobody but the average moviegoers who really knows the two perquisite words in movie-goingfun and fakewill truly appreciate this potboiler of a melodrama, with comedy tosses in a spice, for what it aspires to be. The corpses pile up as fast as the clich&eacute;s in the derivative Joe Gayton and Lewis Colick screenplay. As Detective Keats, Damon Wayans is cast as an undercover cop who convinces Moses (Adam Sandler's dopey but likable criminal blunder brain) that he is his best friend. The trouble begins when Keats bonds a little too well with Moses. Keats feels personally committed to bringing Moses in alive and well. When they try to reel in the kingpin mobster, a wealthy used car salesman played with gleeful abandon by James Caan of "The Godfather." Keats concerns himself more Moses' welfare than the bust. In a weird "Pulp Fiction" torque of events, Moses shoots Keats in the head but neither kills nor cripples him. Moses freaks out, leaves for Mexico, with his pooch (one of those magpie-looking Spuds McKenzie types) to become a bullfighter. The law catches up with Moses, and he agrees to testify against his boss (James Caan) on the condition that Keats serve as his bodyguard. Although Damon Wayans is a truly gifted comic, he could take lessons from his brother Keenen Ivory about playing beefy, tough-guys. Damon acts more like his "Major Payne" character here when he should have used his rugged quarterback hero from "The Last Boy Scout." He is a cheese cake action hero here. But it is fun to watch the antics of Wayans and Sandler (a foul-mouthed, 1950s' era Jerry Lewis wannabe) as they blunder through a series of impossible obstacles. The filmmakers serve up seemingly non-stop action like a Saturday Morning television cartoon. They plunge our bulletproof heroes into several unreal but really predictable predicaments. Eventually, the action brings our buddies to the big shoot'em up in James Caan's palatial residence and at least one surprise. If you figure out that surprise before the Dickerson and company reveal it, you have obviously gone into the wrong theater. "Juice" director Dickerson got his start as a cinematographer for Spike Lee in epics such as "Do The Right Thing," makes "Bulletproof" look more visually slick and sophisticate than it deserves to be considering how imitative it remains. Each shot contains imaginative compositional elements that you won't be able to savor on a small screen. The lighting is extremely well-done. Actor James Farentino, who plays Wayan's sinister police department superior, is lighted so evocatively that he appears suspicious. Dickerson's big problem here is that the headlong action must break intermittently at all comedy stops. "Bulletproof" employs comedy to insulate its audiences from the effect of thinking too much about the wildly improbable scenes of simulated violence that recur throughout the film. After somebody gets iced, a joke is delivered to make you forget that they've been killed or, in the case of our heroes, escaped certain death. James Caan indulges himself as the used car salesman drug lord. In one scene, he removes his toupee so it won't get dirty during a showdown with Wayans. Caan gives his villainy the appropriate inflection for the kind of hokum that pads out "Bulletproof." He is nowhere near the bastard that he was in the Arnold Schwarzenegger thriller "Eraser." The usual quota of souped-up car chases, gunfights, and four-letter oaths ought to delight hardcore action fans, but they may miss the more amorous matings that occur in the more dramatic male sagas. Composer Elmer Bernstein enhances the super-charged action scenes with some humming, hipster-cool incidental music, especially in the introductory urban car chase scene. "Bulletproof" is definitely no classic, but it has its share of entertaining moments.

    Rock Keats and Archie Moses are best friends and have spent the past year together performing various small time crimes. This all changes when they become involved in a major drug smuggling operation. Rock Keats turns out to be Jack Carter, an undercover police officer and tries to arrest Moses during a failed attempt to catch criminal mastermind Frank Colton. However, Moses ends up shooting Carter and makes an escape. Moses is later caught and agrees to turn state's evidence on Colton with one condition, Carter escorts him in. When they meet, both are bitter towards each other. Unknown to them, Colton's men have orders to take out Moses and arrive to shoot down the transport plane. Carter and Moses end up by themselves in the countryside with Colton's men closing in......... Back in 1996, Wayans was bigger than Sandler, but it was already changing, Wayans had a string of flops and Sandler had just done Billy Madison. Wayans got top billing, and this is probably why it flopped big time. But it's a really fun easy going movie at a running time that couldn't offend anybody. It a load of old cobblers plot wise, and the buddy buddy thing was dying a death, but the two leads are amiable enough and Caan wasn't too bad as the villain. It's not very memorable though, and it's full of clich&eacute;s, but for Sandler fans and Wayans fans, this will suffice.

Furthermore, some slight provocative moments: (Waynes) and (Sandler) escape from the police station after threatening the whole department so dozens of policemen run after them, and THEN they're both enjoying their time in a strip club !!?? There is some excessive buffoonery also, to have that tense between being a comedy and a thriller. The direction is idealistically not cinematic, handling the mission like a TV episode, or a sitcom.. A boring serious one too. All the scenes suffered of zero budget so the word poor came with so many meanings here. Look at the deadly climax (shame to call it one in the first place) to know exactly what I mean. Basically there are better straight-to-video movies than this one ! (Kristen Wilson) was the only "pretty" thing in here yet as the plot's potentials both were lost. So it's the case of a thriller comedy which having the comedians as Action heroes, with destitute action, and even off-color comedy ! It is interesting indeed as a perfect type for a formula with a disorder. It could've been good though, but in another movie. Generally, I can be wrong to say that it wasn't entertaining, but I can be fair to say it was lowly entertaining.

    Drug runner Archie Moses introduces his friend Rock Keats to his boss, drug kingpin Frank Colton. Unknown to Moses, Keats is actually an undercover police officer. During the bust on Colton's factory, Moses accidentally shoots Keats in the head. He survives the wound & later arrests Moses. Dodging Colton's hired assassins, the duo must overcome their mutual hatred to survive. Adam Sandler's films are usually a hit-&-miss affair, with his comedies either loved by his fans or hated by everyone. This one is not as stupid as his other films, but still cannot overcome a lazy script. The direction is incredibly patchy, with fast-paced action sequences giving way to slow comic exchanges between Sandler & Damon Wayans. Some of the action scenes  flying a plane with no engines, a car chase at night through a forest  are quite absurdly contrived. The acting is the standard for this genre, with Sandler & Wayans making a good pairing. In short, the film is dumb but fun to watch. Grade: C+ Review by M. K. Geist

    This movie was hilarious. i don't know how come it's got such a low rating. It's a comedy, it's not supposed to make you think about the meaning of life, but to make you laugh. And if you didn't laugh watching it..you have some serious problems..Or you are more than 75 and shouldn't watch it cuz u might get a heart attack . Anyway, besides Adam Sandler, the dog does an excellent job, especially at playing drunk when Adam Sandler gets busted by the cops on the highway. It's not as stupid as waterboy, Sandler doesn't act that stupid. It might actually be my favorite Adam Sandler movie, but it still has to compete with Anger Management and Happy Gilmore. And if we can rule out Happy Gilmore, Anger Management is another freaking hilarious movie.. Difficult choice. But i recommend it to every Adam Sandler fan who hasn't seen it yet. And to everybody else that enjoys a good laugh. If you can't laugh, don't bother to register and vote. You'll ruin it.

    This has to be one of the worst movies I ever saw. I should have known by it's release date - September - I was in for less than a treat. That's after all of the summer blockbusters have been released and before the academy award possibilities start cropping up in October/November. And remember, 1996 was the year that the word "blockbuster" was defined by unwatchable schlock such as Independence Day and Twister. Jack Keats (Damon Wayons) is an undercover cop posing as a car thief in order to get information from a real car thief, Archie Moses (Adam Sandler). The two have actually developed a kind of friendship during the time they are working together. After gaining his trust, Moses offers to introduce Keats to his boss, drug kingpin Frank Colton (James Caan). Keats jumps at the chance to home in on bigger criminal game. Thus as Keats is meeting Colton for the first time, the police appear on the scene to make their arrests in the case. In the resulting chaos, Keats is shot in the head. Keats has a slow but sure recovery. On the bright side, he falls in love with the woman who helps him recover. On the negative side, he now has a metal plate in his head. Afterwards, when he is back on duty, Keats is assigned to escort Moses back to testify against his former employer Colton, a situation neither one is looking forward to. Keats is angry because thanks to Moses he has a metal plate in his head, and Moses is angry because Keats lied to him over the entire year that he thought they were friends and colleagues. This movie seems to be going for the buddy/road film angle, with the exception of the fact that Keats and Moses run into a series of attempts on their lives since Colton, the big drug kingpin, is out to kill them both. This forces them to work together to figure out why their every move seems to be known by Colton before they even make it. Both Wayans and Sandler can be very funny if given the right material, but neither has anything particularly funny to do or say here, since the material they are working with is totally lacking in the imagination and genuine humor that could have exploited the talents of the two leading men. Avoid at all cost. The only reason I remember this movie over ten years later is (a) it is incredibly bad even for a "man movie" and (b) my husband insisted we go see it.

    Watching the new disposable Ernest Dickerson action-comedy "Bulletproof," a cops and robbers buddy picture with Damon Wayans and Adam Sandler as the buds, is like munching great junk food. You know it isn't what you should be eating. Nevertheless, it smells delicious and makes you smack your lips together when you chew. The action scenes, when the bad guys (sometimes even the good guys) get the cream puffs kicked out of them, contain a lot of crunch. The crude-oil "Saturday Night Live" comic scenes, which only anal retentive Neanderthals would savor as instructive, are uproariously self-effacing. Serious film genre scholars may give an appreciative nod to "Bulletproof" simply because it triggers happier memories from classic action pictures, such as Clint Eastwood's "The Gauntlet" (1977), Sam Peckinpah's "The Killer Elite" (1974), and the 1958 Tony Curtis & Sidney Poitier version of "The Defiant Ones." Nobody but the average moviegoers who really knows the two perquisite words in movie-goingfun and fakewill truly appreciate this potboiler of a melodrama, with comedy tosses in a spice, for what it aspires to be. The corpses pile up as fast as the clich&eacute;s in the derivative Joe Gayton and Lewis Colick screenplay. As Detective Keats, Damon Wayans is cast as an undercover cop who convinces Moses (Adam Sandler's dopey but likable criminal blunder brain) that he is his best friend. The trouble begins when Keats bonds a little too well with Moses. Keats feels personally committed to bringing Moses in alive and well. When they try to reel in the kingpin mobster, a wealthy used car salesman played with gleeful abandon by James Caan of "The Godfather." Keats concerns himself more Moses' welfare than the bust. In a weird "Pulp Fiction" torque of events, Moses shoots Keats in the head but neither kills nor cripples him. Moses freaks out, leaves for Mexico, with his pooch (one of those magpie-looking Spuds McKenzie types) to become a bullfighter. The law catches up with Moses, and he agrees to testify against his boss (James Caan) on the condition that Keats serve as his bodyguard. Although Damon Wayans is a truly gifted comic, he could take lessons from his brother Keenen Ivory about playing beefy, tough-guys. Damon acts more like his "Major Payne" character here when he should have used his rugged quarterback hero from "The Last Boy Scout." He is a cheese cake action hero here. But it is fun to watch the antics of Wayans and Sandler (a foul-mouthed, 1950s' era Jerry Lewis wannabe) as they blunder through a series of impossible obstacles. The filmmakers serve up seemingly non-stop action like a Saturday Morning television cartoon. They plunge our bulletproof heroes into several unreal but really predictable predicaments. Eventually, the action brings our buddies to the big shoot'em up in James Caan's palatial residence and at least one surprise. If you figure out that surprise before the Dickerson and company reveal it, you have obviously gone into the wrong theater. "Juice" director Dickerson got his start as a cinematographer for Spike Lee in epics such as "Do The Right Thing," makes "Bulletproof" look more visually slick and sophisticate than it deserves to be considering how imitative it remains. Each shot contains imaginative compositional elements that you won't be able to savor on a small screen. The lighting is extremely well-done. Actor James Farentino, who plays Wayan's sinister police department superior, is lighted so evocatively that he appears suspicious. Dickerson's big problem here is that the headlong action must break intermittently at all comedy stops. "Bulletproof" employs comedy to insulate its audiences from the effect of thinking too much about the wildly improbable scenes of simulated violence that recur throughout the film. After somebody gets iced, a joke is delivered to make you forget that they've been killed or, in the case of our heroes, escaped certain death. James Caan indulges himself as the used car salesman drug lord. In one scene, he removes his toupee so it won't get dirty during a showdown with Wayans. Caan gives his villainy the appropriate inflection for the kind of hokum that pads out "Bulletproof." He is nowhere near the bastard that he was in the Arnold Schwarzenegger thriller "Eraser." The usual quota of souped-up car chases, gunfights, and four-letter oaths ought to delight hardcore action fans, but they may miss the more amorous matings that occur in the more dramatic male sagas. Composer Elmer Bernstein enhances the super-charged action scenes with some humming, hipster-cool incidental music, especially in the introductory urban car chase scene. "Bulletproof" is definitely no classic, but it has its share of entertaining moments.

    Rock Keats and Archie Moses are best friends and have spent the past year together performing various small time crimes. This all changes when they become involved in a major drug smuggling operation. Rock Keats turns out to be Jack Carter, an undercover police officer and tries to arrest Moses during a failed attempt to catch criminal mastermind Frank Colton. However, Moses ends up shooting Carter and makes an escape. Moses is later caught and agrees to turn state's evidence on Colton with one condition, Carter escorts him in. When they meet, both are bitter towards each other. Unknown to them, Colton's men have orders to take out Moses and arrive to shoot down the transport plane. Carter and Moses end up by themselves in the countryside with Colton's men closing in......... Back in 1996, Wayans was bigger than Sandler, but it was already changing, Wayans had a string of flops and Sandler had just done Billy Madison. Wayans got top billing, and this is probably why it flopped big time. But it's a really fun easy going movie at a running time that couldn't offend anybody. It a load of old cobblers plot wise, and the buddy buddy thing was dying a death, but the two leads are amiable enough and Caan wasn't too bad as the villain. It's not very memorable though, and it's full of clich&eacute;s, but for Sandler fans and Wayans fans, this will suffice.

    Another one of Sandler movies with the same verdict for me: okay for Television but not good enough for cinema or worthy to spend money on for DVD. The beginning is quite entertaining and then it develops into a much too predictable movie, with the ending being most typical of Adam Sandler. It is however fairly entertaining to see but only if you have limited cinema/film experience like I did when I first saw it (I must have been about 15 when I staggered upon it on Television). However, once I began to really see cinematographic masterpieces, movies such as these are a pure embarrassment to cinema and should really not be funded. x

    Bulletproof (1996) *** (out of 4) After agreeing to testify against a drug lord (James Caan), lowlife Moses (Adam Sandler) ends up with the undercover cop (Damon Wayans) that originally busted him. The two end up out on the road with hit men and dirty cops after them trying to make sure Moses can't get to court but the biggest threat for the two men are each other. If you're looking for a smart and intelligent film then you're not going to find it here but if you're just looking for a good time then the two stars really deliver. There's no question that this is a "B" movie as there's nothing ground-breaking here and you're not going to have your life changed in any way, shape or form. BULLETPROOF has a simple plot that's just meant to give the two stars something to work their magic with. I think the strongest point of the film are its two stars because they share some terrific chemistry and really take the material and do something special with it. The majority of the humor is silly R-rated stuff like porn jokes, urine jokes and other things like that but the way Wayans and Sandler sells it makes it funny. There are some hilarious moments here including a Disneyland joke early in the picture and the constant banter between the two really works well. The two actors really make you believe their characters and this allows the situation to be funny and especially in the scenes where Wayans pretty much abuses Sandler over the issue that happened at the start of the film. Caan is pretty much just being himself and picking up a paycheck but he's always worth watching and it's fun to see him here. BULLETPROOF also contains some fun action scenes, is well-directed and really just delivers nice laughs.

    I actually wanted to like Bulletproof, despite my general dislike for Adam Sandler, because I like buddy movies and James Caan is a great actor. I give Bulletproof some credit for some slickly shot shoot-out sequences, but other than that everything else feels wrong to me. When I think of a good buddy movie, I think of likable characters, juicy dialogue to savour and some dynamicism in the action sequences. Some people watching Bulletproof may find these things, and I do respect that, however for me what I found here was the complete opposite on all counts. I really didn't care for any of the characters, finding them clich&eacute;d and annoying, especially Sandler's character. In fact, I found myself rooting more for the villains, but wished there was more to them. Bulletproof just wasn't funny to me either, I love action movies with comedy when it is good, but apart from one or two mildly amusing parts the dialogue was corny and the jokes rather tasteless. There is nothing dynamic about the action sequences, they may be slickly shot but the way they are choreographed at times is inept and the complete lack of subtlety in the violence leaves a bad taste in the mouth afterwards. The story is predictable with very little coming across as truly thrilling, while all the performances fall flat. Sandler has definitely done worse and more irritating performances, but his performance consists of near-unintelligible mumbling and I found myself annoyed by his character right from the start. Damon Wayans fares better, having more charisma, but the dialogue is so lame, the chemistry between him and Sandler so forced and the character so clich&eacute;d, it comes across as a wasted effort. James Caan is a great actor, but the first thought that came into my head after finishing Bulletproof was, what on earth was he doing here? He tried, but deserved so much better. Overall, a movie I wanted to like, but apart from one or two small things it didn't deliver. 1/10 Bethany Cox

    This movie is about friendship and betrayal. Both of the major characters in this movie are betrayed by their closest friends, and come to understand what it is really like to be betrayed. One of them is an undercover cop while the other is a criminal, but also quite timid, but has joined forces, and then earned the emnity, of a major drug lord. The movie opens with the cop and Archie Moses as best friends stealing a car, but we quickly learn that the cop is an undercover cop who is trying to bust a drug dealer who owns a huge car dealership. Moses then brings the cop to the factory and it is discovered that he is a cop and the police raid the place. The cop wants to protected Archie, but due to an accident, Archie shoots him in the head. Months later, the cop has fallen in love with his therapist and Archie is running from the drug lord. He is found by the police but requests that this cop return and escort him back. There isn't much to say about this movie other than how they begin as best friends, but after the truth is revealed, Archie cannot trust him anymore. The cop in upset because Archie shot him, but does not want to believe that it was an accident. We also know that somebody else is tipping them off, but we do not know who, but the movie is about the friend's betrayal, and is summed up in Archie's comment to the cop, "now you know how it feels to be betrayed by a friend." The drug lord is interesting because he also owns a used car yard and we always see his advertisement on television. It is as if this guy is flaunting himself in front of everybody, and those who know the truth about him are frustrated because they cannot get at him. Archie has the evidence, but the guy wants Archie dead because of his relationship with the cop. This is not a bad movie, but Adam Sandler has done far better. It is not really a comedy, more of an action movie, and though Sandler does act weirdly, this movie does not stand out in my opinion.

    This is interesting case. The thrillers with 2 totally discordant partners are quite familiar since the start of the 1980s. The formula got (Lethal Weapon) in 1987, then the sequel in 1989, where the sense of comedy was so lucid, as semi-iconic example for the buddy movie which was all over the place during that era. Once we've had 2 actors whom can do comedy (Lethal Weapon), one actor and one comedian (48 Hours), one actor to be comic and one comedian to act (Midnight Run), or 2 comedians yet into comedy (Dragnet). Here, despite how poor the atmosphere was, the main problem remains in casting strangely 2 "comic" tiny stars, at the time, to be the lead of what supposed to be a thriller. And the personality of the movie went wrong since that. You can't settle.. Is that a slapstick comedy, or a violent thriller ?? I was really sad because of the potentials of this hot plot, they're totally wasted. Despite the efforts (Damon Waynes) with the beard made to look serious but sorry that was in the wrong place, he was mostly cool but everything wasn't. (Adam Sandler) looked tepid or slack and relied only on his funny charisma to do the whole thing for him. (James Cann) must've needed money hard, but not to wonder because after watching him in (Alien Nation - 1988) I became convinced that I can see him in anything ! At least he had not much to do. Furthermore, some slight provocative moments: (Waynes) and (Sandler) escape from the police station after threatening the whole department so dozens of policemen run after them, and THEN they're both enjoying their time in a strip club !!?? There is some excessive buffoonery also, to have that tense between being a comedy and a thriller. The direction is idealistically not cinematic, handling the mission like a TV episode, or a sitcom.. A boring serious one too. All the scenes suffered of zero budget so the word poor came with so many meanings here. Look at the deadly climax (shame to call it one in the first place) to know exactly what I mean. Basically there are better straight-to-video movies than this one ! (Kristen Wilson) was the only "pretty" thing in here yet as the plot's potentials both were lost. So it's the case of a thriller comedy which having the comedians as Action heroes, with destitute action, and even off-color comedy ! It is interesting indeed as a perfect type for a formula with a disorder. It could've been good though, but in another movie. Generally, I can be wrong to say that it wasn't entertaining, but I can be fair to say it was lowly entertaining.

"Bulletproof" employs comedy to insulate its audiences from the effect of thinking too much about the wildly improbable scenes of simulated violence that recur throughout the film. After somebody gets iced, a joke is delivered to make you forget that they've been killed or, in the case of our heroes, escaped certain death. James Caan indulges himself as the used car salesman drug lord. In one scene, he removes his toupee so it won't get dirty during a showdown with Wayans. Caan gives his villainy the appropriate inflection for the kind of hokum that pads out "Bulletproof." He is nowhere near the bastard that he was in the Arnold Schwarzenegger thriller "Eraser." The usual quota of souped-up car chases, gunfights, and four-letter oaths ought to delight hardcore action fans, but they may miss the more amorous matings that occur in the more dramatic male sagas. Composer Elmer Bernstein enhances the super-charged action scenes with some humming, hipster-cool incidental music, especially in the introductory urban car chase scene. "Bulletproof" is definitely no classic, but it has its share of entertaining moments.

    Rock Keats and Archie Moses are best friends and have spent the past year together performing various small time crimes. This all changes when they become involved in a major drug smuggling operation. Rock Keats turns out to be Jack Carter, an undercover police officer and tries to arrest Moses during a failed attempt to catch criminal mastermind Frank Colton. However, Moses ends up shooting Carter and makes an escape. Moses is later caught and agrees to turn state's evidence on Colton with one condition, Carter escorts him in. When they meet, both are bitter towards each other. Unknown to them, Colton's men have orders to take out Moses and arrive to shoot down the transport plane. Carter and Moses end up by themselves in the countryside with Colton's men closing in......... Back in 1996, Wayans was bigger than Sandler, but it was already changing, Wayans had a string of flops and Sandler had just done Billy Madison. Wayans got top billing, and this is probably why it flopped big time. But it's a really fun easy going movie at a running time that couldn't offend anybody. It a load of old cobblers plot wise, and the buddy buddy thing was dying a death, but the two leads are amiable enough and Caan wasn't too bad as the villain. It's not very memorable though, and it's full of clich&eacute;s, but for Sandler fans and Wayans fans, this will suffice.

    Another one of Sandler movies with the same verdict for me: okay for Television but not good enough for cinema or worthy to spend money on for DVD. The beginning is quite entertaining and then it develops into a much too predictable movie, with the ending being most typical of Adam Sandler. It is however fairly entertaining to see but only if you have limited cinema/film experience like I did when I first saw it (I must have been about 15 when I staggered upon it on Television). However, once I began to really see cinematographic masterpieces, movies such as these are a pure embarrassment to cinema and should really not be funded. x

    Bulletproof (1996) *** (out of 4) After agreeing to testify against a drug lord (James Caan), lowlife Moses (Adam Sandler) ends up with the undercover cop (Damon Wayans) that originally busted him. The two end up out on the road with hit men and dirty cops after them trying to make sure Moses can't get to court but the biggest threat for the two men are each other. If you're looking for a smart and intelligent film then you're not going to find it here but if you're just looking for a good time then the two stars really deliver. There's no question that this is a "B" movie as there's nothing ground-breaking here and you're not going to have your life changed in any way, shape or form. BULLETPROOF has a simple plot that's just meant to give the two stars something to work their magic with. I think the strongest point of the film are its two stars because they share some terrific chemistry and really take the material and do something special with it. The majority of the humor is silly R-rated stuff like porn jokes, urine jokes and other things like that but the way Wayans and Sandler sells it makes it funny. There are some hilarious moments here including a Disneyland joke early in the picture and the constant banter between the two really works well. The two actors really make you believe their characters and this allows the situation to be funny and especially in the scenes where Wayans pretty much abuses Sandler over the issue that happened at the start of the film. Caan is pretty much just being himself and picking up a paycheck but he's always worth watching and it's fun to see him here. BULLETPROOF also contains some fun action scenes, is well-directed and really just delivers nice laughs.

    I actually wanted to like Bulletproof, despite my general dislike for Adam Sandler, because I like buddy movies and James Caan is a great actor. I give Bulletproof some credit for some slickly shot shoot-out sequences, but other than that everything else feels wrong to me. When I think of a good buddy movie, I think of likable characters, juicy dialogue to savour and some dynamicism in the action sequences. Some people watching Bulletproof may find these things, and I do respect that, however for me what I found here was the complete opposite on all counts. I really didn't care for any of the characters, finding them clich&eacute;d and annoying, especially Sandler's character. In fact, I found myself rooting more for the villains, but wished there was more to them. Bulletproof just wasn't funny to me either, I love action movies with comedy when it is good, but apart from one or two mildly amusing parts the dialogue was corny and the jokes rather tasteless. There is nothing dynamic about the action sequences, they may be slickly shot but the way they are choreographed at times is inept and the complete lack of subtlety in the violence leaves a bad taste in the mouth afterwards. The story is predictable with very little coming across as truly thrilling, while all the performances fall flat. Sandler has definitely done worse and more irritating performances, but his performance consists of near-unintelligible mumbling and I found myself annoyed by his character right from the start. Damon Wayans fares better, having more charisma, but the dialogue is so lame, the chemistry between him and Sandler so forced and the character so clich&eacute;d, it comes across as a wasted effort. James Caan is a great actor, but the first thought that came into my head after finishing Bulletproof was, what on earth was he doing here? He tried, but deserved so much better. Overall, a movie I wanted to like, but apart from one or two small things it didn't deliver. 1/10 Bethany Cox

    This movie is about friendship and betrayal. Both of the major characters in this movie are betrayed by their closest friends, and come to understand what it is really like to be betrayed. One of them is an undercover cop while the other is a criminal, but also quite timid, but has joined forces, and then earned the emnity, of a major drug lord. The movie opens with the cop and Archie Moses as best friends stealing a car, but we quickly learn that the cop is an undercover cop who is trying to bust a drug dealer who owns a huge car dealership. Moses then brings the cop to the factory and it is discovered that he is a cop and the police raid the place. The cop wants to protected Archie, but due to an accident, Archie shoots him in the head. Months later, the cop has fallen in love with his therapist and Archie is running from the drug lord. He is found by the police but requests that this cop return and escort him back. There isn't much to say about this movie other than how they begin as best friends, but after the truth is revealed, Archie cannot trust him anymore. The cop in upset because Archie shot him, but does not want to believe that it was an accident. We also know that somebody else is tipping them off, but we do not know who, but the movie is about the friend's betrayal, and is summed up in Archie's comment to the cop, "now you know how it feels to be betrayed by a friend." The drug lord is interesting because he also owns a used car yard and we always see his advertisement on television. It is as if this guy is flaunting himself in front of everybody, and those who know the truth about him are frustrated because they cannot get at him. Archie has the evidence, but the guy wants Archie dead because of his relationship with the cop. This is not a bad movie, but Adam Sandler has done far better. It is not really a comedy, more of an action movie, and though Sandler does act weirdly, this movie does not stand out in my opinion.

    This is interesting case. The thrillers with 2 totally discordant partners are quite familiar since the start of the 1980s. The formula got (Lethal Weapon) in 1987, then the sequel in 1989, where the sense of comedy was so lucid, as semi-iconic example for the buddy movie which was all over the place during that era. Once we've had 2 actors whom can do comedy (Lethal Weapon), one actor and one comedian (48 Hours), one actor to be comic and one comedian to act (Midnight Run), or 2 comedians yet into comedy (Dragnet). Here, despite how poor the atmosphere was, the main problem remains in casting strangely 2 "comic" tiny stars, at the time, to be the lead of what supposed to be a thriller. And the personality of the movie went wrong since that. You can't settle.. Is that a slapstick comedy, or a violent thriller ?? I was really sad because of the potentials of this hot plot, they're totally wasted. Despite the efforts (Damon Waynes) with the beard made to look serious but sorry that was in the wrong place, he was mostly cool but everything wasn't. (Adam Sandler) looked tepid or slack and relied only on his funny charisma to do the whole thing for him. (James Cann) must've needed money hard, but not to wonder because after watching him in (Alien Nation - 1988) I became convinced that I can see him in anything ! At least he had not much to do. Furthermore, some slight provocative moments: (Waynes) and (Sandler) escape from the police station after threatening the whole department so dozens of policemen run after them, and THEN they're both enjoying their time in a strip club !!?? There is some excessive buffoonery also, to have that tense between being a comedy and a thriller. The direction is idealistically not cinematic, handling the mission like a TV episode, or a sitcom.. A boring serious one too. All the scenes suffered of zero budget so the word poor came with so many meanings here. Look at the deadly climax (shame to call it one in the first place) to know exactly what I mean. Basically there are better straight-to-video movies than this one ! (Kristen Wilson) was the only "pretty" thing in here yet as the plot's potentials both were lost. So it's the case of a thriller comedy which having the comedians as Action heroes, with destitute action, and even off-color comedy ! It is interesting indeed as a perfect type for a formula with a disorder. It could've been good though, but in another movie. Generally, I can be wrong to say that it wasn't entertaining, but I can be fair to say it was lowly entertaining.

    Drug runner Archie Moses introduces his friend Rock Keats to his boss, drug kingpin Frank Colton. Unknown to Moses, Keats is actually an undercover police officer. During the bust on Colton's factory, Moses accidentally shoots Keats in the head. He survives the wound & later arrests Moses. Dodging Colton's hired assassins, the duo must overcome their mutual hatred to survive. Adam Sandler's films are usually a hit-&-miss affair, with his comedies either loved by his fans or hated by everyone. This one is not as stupid as his other films, but still cannot overcome a lazy script. The direction is incredibly patchy, with fast-paced action sequences giving way to slow comic exchanges between Sandler & Damon Wayans. Some of the action scenes  flying a plane with no engines, a car chase at night through a forest  are quite absurdly contrived. The acting is the standard for this genre, with Sandler & Wayans making a good pairing. In short, the film is dumb but fun to watch. Grade: C+ Review by M. K. Geist

    This movie was hilarious. i don't know how come it's got such a low rating. It's a comedy, it's not supposed to make you think about the meaning of life, but to make you laugh. And if you didn't laugh watching it..you have some serious problems..Or you are more than 75 and shouldn't watch it cuz u might get a heart attack . Anyway, besides Adam Sandler, the dog does an excellent job, especially at playing drunk when Adam Sandler gets busted by the cops on the highway. It's not as stupid as waterboy, Sandler doesn't act that stupid. It might actually be my favorite Adam Sandler movie, but it still has to compete with Anger Management and Happy Gilmore. And if we can rule out Happy Gilmore, Anger Management is another freaking hilarious movie.. Difficult choice. But i recommend it to every Adam Sandler fan who hasn't seen it yet. And to everybody else that enjoys a good laugh. If you can't laugh, don't bother to register and vote. You'll ruin it.

    This has to be one of the worst movies I ever saw. I should have known by it's release date - September - I was in for less than a treat. That's after all of the summer blockbusters have been released and before the academy award possibilities start cropping up in October/November. And remember, 1996 was the year that the word "blockbuster" was defined by unwatchable schlock such as Independence Day and Twister. Jack Keats (Damon Wayons) is an undercover cop posing as a car thief in order to get information from a real car thief, Archie Moses (Adam Sandler). The two have actually developed a kind of friendship during the time they are working together. After gaining his trust, Moses offers to introduce Keats to his boss, drug kingpin Frank Colton (James Caan). Keats jumps at the chance to home in on bigger criminal game. Thus as Keats is meeting Colton for the first time, the police appear on the scene to make their arrests in the case. In the resulting chaos, Keats is shot in the head. Keats has a slow but sure recovery. On the bright side, he falls in love with the woman who helps him recover. On the negative side, he now has a metal plate in his head. Afterwards, when he is back on duty, Keats is assigned to escort Moses back to testify against his former employer Colton, a situation neither one is looking forward to. Keats is angry because thanks to Moses he has a metal plate in his head, and Moses is angry because Keats lied to him over the entire year that he thought they were friends and colleagues. This movie seems to be going for the buddy/road film angle, with the exception of the fact that Keats and Moses run into a series of attempts on their lives since Colton, the big drug kingpin, is out to kill them both. This forces them to work together to figure out why their every move seems to be known by Colton before they even make it. Both Wayans and Sandler can be very funny if given the right material, but neither has anything particularly funny to do or say here, since the material they are working with is totally lacking in the imagination and genuine humor that could have exploited the talents of the two leading men. Avoid at all cost. The only reason I remember this movie over ten years later is (a) it is incredibly bad even for a "man movie" and (b) my husband insisted we go see it.

    Watching the new disposable Ernest Dickerson action-comedy "Bulletproof," a cops and robbers buddy picture with Damon Wayans and Adam Sandler as the buds, is like munching great junk food. You know it isn't what you should be eating. Nevertheless, it smells delicious and makes you smack your lips together when you chew. The action scenes, when the bad guys (sometimes even the good guys) get the cream puffs kicked out of them, contain a lot of crunch. The crude-oil "Saturday Night Live" comic scenes, which only anal retentive Neanderthals would savor as instructive, are uproariously self-effacing. Serious film genre scholars may give an appreciative nod to "Bulletproof" simply because it triggers happier memories from classic action pictures, such as Clint Eastwood's "The Gauntlet" (1977), Sam Peckinpah's "The Killer Elite" (1974), and the 1958 Tony Curtis & Sidney Poitier version of "The Defiant Ones." Nobody but the average moviegoers who really knows the two perquisite words in movie-goingfun and fakewill truly appreciate this potboiler of a melodrama, with comedy tosses in a spice, for what it aspires to be. The corpses pile up as fast as the clich&eacute;s in the derivative Joe Gayton and Lewis Colick screenplay. As Detective Keats, Damon Wayans is cast as an undercover cop who convinces Moses (Adam Sandler's dopey but likable criminal blunder brain) that he is his best friend. The trouble begins when Keats bonds a little too well with Moses. Keats feels personally committed to bringing Moses in alive and well. When they try to reel in the kingpin mobster, a wealthy used car salesman played with gleeful abandon by James Caan of "The Godfather." Keats concerns himself more Moses' welfare than the bust. In a weird "Pulp Fiction" torque of events, Moses shoots Keats in the head but neither kills nor cripples him. Moses freaks out, leaves for Mexico, with his pooch (one of those magpie-looking Spuds McKenzie types) to become a bullfighter. The law catches up with Moses, and he agrees to testify against his boss (James Caan) on the condition that Keats serve as his bodyguard. Although Damon Wayans is a truly gifted comic, he could take lessons from his brother Keenen Ivory about playing beefy, tough-guys. Damon acts more like his "Major Payne" character here when he should have used his rugged quarterback hero from "The Last Boy Scout." He is a cheese cake action hero here. But it is fun to watch the antics of Wayans and Sandler (a foul-mouthed, 1950s' era Jerry Lewis wannabe) as they blunder through a series of impossible obstacles. The filmmakers serve up seemingly non-stop action like a Saturday Morning television cartoon. They plunge our bulletproof heroes into several unreal but really predictable predicaments. Eventually, the action brings our buddies to the big shoot'em up in James Caan's palatial residence and at least one surprise. If you figure out that surprise before the Dickerson and company reveal it, you have obviously gone into the wrong theater. "Juice" director Dickerson got his start as a cinematographer for Spike Lee in epics such as "Do The Right Thing," makes "Bulletproof" look more visually slick and sophisticate than it deserves to be considering how imitative it remains. Each shot contains imaginative compositional elements that you won't be able to savor on a small screen. The lighting is extremely well-done. Actor James Farentino, who plays Wayan's sinister police department superior, is lighted so evocatively that he appears suspicious. Dickerson's big problem here is that the headlong action must break intermittently at all comedy stops. "Bulletproof" employs comedy to insulate its audiences from the effect of thinking too much about the wildly improbable scenes of simulated violence that recur throughout the film. After somebody gets iced, a joke is delivered to make you forget that they've been killed or, in the case of our heroes, escaped certain death. James Caan indulges himself as the used car salesman drug lord. In one scene, he removes his toupee so it won't get dirty during a showdown with Wayans. Caan gives his villainy the appropriate inflection for the kind of hokum that pads out "Bulletproof." He is nowhere near the bastard that he was in the Arnold Schwarzenegger thriller "Eraser." The usual quota of souped-up car chases, gunfights, and four-letter oaths ought to delight hardcore action fans, but they may miss the more amorous matings that occur in the more dramatic male sagas. Composer Elmer Bernstein enhances the super-charged action scenes with some humming, hipster-cool incidental music, especially in the introductory urban car chase scene. "Bulletproof" is definitely no classic, but it has its share of entertaining moments.

    This is interesting case. The thrillers with 2 totally discordant partners are quite familiar since the start of the 1980s. The formula got (Lethal Weapon) in 1987, then the sequel in 1989, where the sense of comedy was so lucid, as semi-iconic example for the buddy movie which was all over the place during that era. Once we've had 2 actors whom can do comedy (Lethal Weapon), one actor and one comedian (48 Hours), one actor to be comic and one comedian to act (Midnight Run), or 2 comedians yet into comedy (Dragnet). Here, despite how poor the atmosphere was, the main problem remains in casting strangely 2 "comic" tiny stars, at the time, to be the lead of what supposed to be a thriller. And the personality of the movie went wrong since that. You can't settle.. Is that a slapstick comedy, or a violent thriller ?? I was really sad because of the potentials of this hot plot, they're totally wasted. Despite the efforts (Damon Waynes) with the beard made to look serious but sorry that was in the wrong place, he was mostly cool but everything wasn't. (Adam Sandler) looked tepid or slack and relied only on his funny charisma to do the whole thing for him. (James Cann) must've needed money hard, but not to wonder because after watching him in (Alien Nation - 1988) I became convinced that I can see him in anything ! At least he had not much to do. Furthermore, some slight provocative moments: (Waynes) and (Sandler) escape from the police station after threatening the whole department so dozens of policemen run after them, and THEN they're both enjoying their time in a strip club !!?? There is some excessive buffoonery also, to have that tense between being a comedy and a thriller. The direction is idealistically not cinematic, handling the mission like a TV episode, or a sitcom.. A boring serious one too. All the scenes suffered of zero budget so the word poor came with so many meanings here. Look at the deadly climax (shame to call it one in the first place) to know exactly what I mean. Basically there are better straight-to-video movies than this one ! (Kristen Wilson) was the only "pretty" thing in here yet as the plot's potentials both were lost. So it's the case of a thriller comedy which having the comedians as Action heroes, with destitute action, and even off-color comedy ! It is interesting indeed as a perfect type for a formula with a disorder. It could've been good though, but in another movie. Generally, I can be wrong to say that it wasn't entertaining, but I can be fair to say it was lowly entertaining.

    Drug runner Archie Moses introduces his friend Rock Keats to his boss, drug kingpin Frank Colton. Unknown to Moses, Keats is actually an undercover police officer. During the bust on Colton's factory, Moses accidentally shoots Keats in the head. He survives the wound & later arrests Moses. Dodging Colton's hired assassins, the duo must overcome their mutual hatred to survive. Adam Sandler's films are usually a hit-&-miss affair, with his comedies either loved by his fans or hated by everyone. This one is not as stupid as his other films, but still cannot overcome a lazy script. The direction is incredibly patchy, with fast-paced action sequences giving way to slow comic exchanges between Sandler & Damon Wayans. Some of the action scenes  flying a plane with no engines, a car chase at night through a forest  are quite absurdly contrived. The acting is the standard for this genre, with Sandler & Wayans making a good pairing. In short, the film is dumb but fun to watch. Grade: C+ Review by M. K. Geist

    This movie was hilarious. i don't know how come it's got such a low rating. It's a comedy, it's not supposed to make you think about the meaning of life, but to make you laugh. And if you didn't laugh watching it..you have some serious problems..Or you are more than 75 and shouldn't watch it cuz u might get a heart attack . Anyway, besides Adam Sandler, the dog does an excellent job, especially at playing drunk when Adam Sandler gets busted by the cops on the highway. It's not as stupid as waterboy, Sandler doesn't act that stupid. It might actually be my favorite Adam Sandler movie, but it still has to compete with Anger Management and Happy Gilmore. And if we can rule out Happy Gilmore, Anger Management is another freaking hilarious movie.. Difficult choice. But i recommend it to every Adam Sandler fan who hasn't seen it yet. And to everybody else that enjoys a good laugh. If you can't laugh, don't bother to register and vote. You'll ruin it.
