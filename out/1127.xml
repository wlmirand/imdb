    "The Truman show" was a movie that shows Truman Burbank's life as a reality TV show, without his knowledge since his birth. Jim Carrey was Truman Burbank, and his wife Meryl Burbank played by Laura Linney. Truman's best friend Marlon was Noah Emmerich. Christof, The creator of the TV show, was Ed Harris. Jim Carrey was able to mix his silly comedy with thoughtful drama, and the script provided new experience on drama movies. Fighting for freedom, thinking of ways to run away, believing in his feelings, Jim Carrey performance was amazing. After having the curiosity that something is wrong, He tried many times to discover the way to run away, but most of the time he fails. Truman's courage increased in every scene in the movie. Christof was trying to keep Truman under control by directing the actors to what to do next. Until he decided that he was ready to die to get his freedom. Truman said, "Is that the best you can do? You gonna have to kill me." Also, every other actor in the movie tried to stop him from his wife, best friend, and secondary actors. Meryl tried to break him down every time he was thinking to travel by reminding him of their financial responsibility. "I think you should save for a few months, and then go," she said, she was laughing. Again, his friend tried to convince him that their city is the best place in the world by touching Truman's feelings by his words, "look at that sun set Truman, it is perfect." Every actor did a great job in this movie by involving their emotion in their acting, and that helped to make the audience connect emotionally with the movie. The romance, the drama, and the action in the movie had become from the script. The script helped the actors to have many ways to express their feelings by the words they were saying or by the action they were doing. Marlon said, "He is goon,", "Cut transmission," frustrated,Christof react. Additionally, it rearranged the idea of the drama movies by adding a little romance, action, and comedy to the drama to make the movie suitable to all tastes. Fighting against the storm,looking to the picture of his love, looking to the bright sun, Jim Carrey was successful in mixing all these feeling in one scene. Directed by Peter Weir, written by Andrew Niccol, starring by Jim Carrey, "The Truman Show" was a great movie to watch. It had a new experience that made it different from the rest of the drama movies. Skilled actors and a precise script made it one of the best movies that involve the audience emotionally and make them react with every scene. Truman was trapped in his life, and there were people controlling his live. That left viewers thinking if they trapped in their lives, or there is someone controlling their lives.

    Far from being a masterpiece, this film has something special to offer to the viewers. It's really enjoyable, fun and smart. Besides subtly criticizing the media and it's ways of manipulation this film was a true lesson to me. It made me think about the importance of living, knowing and discovering. Some of us fear change and can't easily get out of their comfort zone. I think it's a big deal to have the courage to leave your home, that place that made you who you are to face the world and get to know yourself better. The human mind is a very complex "toy" but also fragile. Sometimes we prefer living a lie because it gives us sort of a sense of security, sometimes we reject new experiences just because they are...new, sometimes we like to live in our own little universe for fear of the others. This film has many morals and it's up to each of us to discover one. For me, the moral was: It's never too late to escape from the perfect little world you've created or the others have created for you and start to LIVE for REAL!

    Amazing movie but guys your movie description ruined the entire twist of the movie... "An insurance salesman/adjuster discovers his entire life is actually a TV show." I knew from start what was happening... thanks!!! :) quoted from other: When I first saw 'The Truman Show' I came out of the theatre amazed. This is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal Jim Carrey movie. I love the dialogue, camera shot, performances, direction, music, and running time of this movie. There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from 'The Truman Show' feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.

    This is my 12th movie review on IMDb. First thing to say is that the entire movie plot - I have never seen/ heard a movie this original before. I have seen Jim Carrey in a some other movies like Bruce Almighty / Ace Ventura and other films were he is funny however for this film funny does not describe it enough !! this movie is funny , real , fun , charming , has heart , intriguing , juicy , touching , has a lot of soul in it , witty , clever and very unique in many ways. Well first before I talk about the movie I would like to say that Peter Weir seems to be a great director - although I have not seen his movie Witness that stars Harrison Ford( that people seem to mention the most on here ) I have seen Dead Poets Society and Fearless that I would say are underrated masterpieces ( i should review those movies on here soon ) !! and this film belongs in the masterpiece category as well it would only make logical sense for me to put ' Witness ' on my Netflix list to watch eventually. So let me talk about this movie a little bit here Truman Burbank is a star of a 24 hour TV show that he has no idea about when he starts to realizes something is wrong in his life his goal ? to be free - he has to " BREAK out of the CAGE " but who gets in the way Ignorant / stubborn / arrogant Christof who as well was brilliantly played the actor whose name is Ed Harris. He is the villain of the movie. Outstanding !!!! this movie is 100 % creative / great actors and Jim Carrey is real innocent emotional human. Ed Harris did a great job , there's a beautiful flow start to end with a wonderful ending of Truman , sound track is amazing , camera shots were greatly unique / lines * the movie had a bunch of great / comical one lines that i need to remember and script gets an A + its rare for a movie to get 10 out 10 however this one deserves it !!!!

    This movie is absolutely different from many movies. It's the only one I have ever seen like it. Also, think about it. What if you were being filmed? How would you find out? What if we're watching you right now ;)? What if I'm being watched :(? How would we know? That's the kind of life Jim Carrey lives in this movie.The ending is very great. His "creator" tells him he built a great life for him in this fake world. He says it's fake but better for him. Jim Carrey would rather live in the real world, with his real love, with real people, with real everything, instead of living this fake life where everyone is nice to him for being a celebrity and they get paid to do so.

    Peter Weir has casted well-known comedians into serious roles before with Robin Williams starring in Dead Poet's Society. We had to study this film in English and I actually got quite excited. This is an astounding movie and is done so well. Jim Carrey plays the main character, Truman Burbank (True-Man). Truman lives what he thinks is a normal life. He has a wife, a home, a friend he's known for most of his life and a desk-job at an insurance agency. What he doesn't realize is that he is actually a star in a 24 hour, live show which is showed all across the globe which documents like a soap-opera his life.The whole film tackles the themes of the power of the media and even religious themes about the God if you look hard enough as Truman starts to realize that his life is different from everyone around him. The script is more than perfect, the dialogue is wonderful and there is an excellent mix of heart-warming stuff as well as some comedy to lighten the mood (a necessity). The film is not too long, which is a good thing because a considerable length for a movie like this could ruin it. The acting is another stand-out along-side the excellent script. Jim Carrey does a great job and I can see how they casted him instead of another normal actor (Yes, Jim, you're not a normal actor). All the actors do a good job but keep an eye out for the man who plays Truman's friend, Marlon, who does amazing and a few scenes you would see why. There's nothing more I can really say about this film, it's thought-provoking, it's wonderfully scripted and acted. It has a few funny scenes to lighten the mood but overall its serious. I must say that it is not a popcorn film but it is also a film which is worth more than one viewing. Watch it twice in a week and you will understand a bit more of the themes and nuances which help create this world. This is the type of movie which really leaves an impression on you after you watch it. I promise you, this movie is not forgettable and you will be left thinking about it hours after the credits appear.

    We all are stuck at those unknown levels which are mysterious and still we are living those levels with all the emotions right from childhood to old age. This movie is one "Philosophical" and "Thought Provoking" movie and Mr. Jim is a real gem of Hollywood & how in this world he did not won Oscar for this performance? Right from start to finish this movie keep you "spell-bounded" and somehow it also reflects light upon "self-realization" & still its a complete entertainer and that's the beauty of "The Truman Show". In our Holy Scripture Mahabharata written by great sage Mr. Ved Vyas it is already written that this world is a biggest stage created by almighty and we all are just elements of his private show and we come and go to and from him according to our conducted deeds.

    The Truman Show has to be one of the most inventive and original films that I've ever seen. Jim Carrey and Laura Linney are the two lead performances of the film. Jim Carrey is unbelievable in this film as a young man that discovers his whole life is actually a TV show. One of those rare gems that we get and one of the best films of the 1990s. I used to watch this movie all the time and find it unbelievable to watch what happens with the plot and characters. A movie that I can really watch over and over again. I find Jim Carrey so talented because of all the types of roles that he can play in movies. I find all the movies that he stars in really fascinating and just a different experience. One of the easiest movies to appreciate which is something that I find interesting about it. I love how it ends and think that it's really a masterpiece. One of my favorite films of all - time. A sweet and beautiful movie that will also make you think.

    There are many entertaining films. Fewer are great ones. Even fewer are ones that are memorable and push the limit in terms of inventive creativity and pure originality. "The Truman Show" is such a tour de force. It is a film that is hard to describe. It is not quite a comedy though it is funny. Neither is it a drama though there are dramatic elements to it. "The Truman Show" can be a genre of its own: fantasy, science-fiction, comedy, drama, adventure, thriller--all fit into this movie. It is that unique. As a feeble attempt to explain the plot, this movie is about a man who lives a seemingly ordinary, middle-class life in suburbia, who happens to be filmed from every angle imaginable. The catch, he does not know about it. As bizarre factors begin to take place, he starts to question his identity and life around him. Like the millions of viewers who turn in to see Mr. Truman, we too are fascinated as to what he does next and "how it will end." Jim Carrey as Truman turns in perhaps his greatest performance (although Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was pretty good too). His trademark humor is left out and he becomes this individual trapped in a world that is beyond his control. The supporting cast is very solid, particularly Ed Harris as Christoph, the man behind the curtain so to speak. However, it is Carrey who steals the show, I mean, it is about him after all. Besides the acting, Peter Weir's direction is sublime, the visual effects are impressive, the editing is well-paced, and the score is simply astounding. If I had to make one criticism about the movie, that is its abrupt ending. That aside, I consider "The Truman Show" to be one of the most creative films ever made and one of my favorites. Way better than "Saving Private Ryan" and "Shakespeare in Love."

    The Truman Show has to be one of the most inventive and original films that I've ever seen. Jim Carrey and Laura Linney are the two lead performances of the film. Jim Carrey is unbelievable in this film as a young man that discovers his whole life is actually a TV show. One of those rare gems that we get and one of the best films of the 1990s. I used to watch this movie all the time and find it unbelievable to watch what happens with the plot and characters. A movie that I can really watch over and over again. I find Jim Carrey so talented because of all the types of roles that he can play in movies. I find all the movies that he stars in really fascinating and just a different experience. One of the easiest movies to appreciate which is something that I find interesting about it. I love how it ends and think that it's really a masterpiece. One of my favorite films of all - time. A sweet and beautiful movie that will also make you think.

    There are many entertaining films. Fewer are great ones. Even fewer are ones that are memorable and push the limit in terms of inventive creativity and pure originality. "The Truman Show" is such a tour de force. It is a film that is hard to describe. It is not quite a comedy though it is funny. Neither is it a drama though there are dramatic elements to it. "The Truman Show" can be a genre of its own: fantasy, science-fiction, comedy, drama, adventure, thriller--all fit into this movie. It is that unique. As a feeble attempt to explain the plot, this movie is about a man who lives a seemingly ordinary, middle-class life in suburbia, who happens to be filmed from every angle imaginable. The catch, he does not know about it. As bizarre factors begin to take place, he starts to question his identity and life around him. Like the millions of viewers who turn in to see Mr. Truman, we too are fascinated as to what he does next and "how it will end." Jim Carrey as Truman turns in perhaps his greatest performance (although Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was pretty good too). His trademark humor is left out and he becomes this individual trapped in a world that is beyond his control. The supporting cast is very solid, particularly Ed Harris as Christoph, the man behind the curtain so to speak. However, it is Carrey who steals the show, I mean, it is about him after all. Besides the acting, Peter Weir's direction is sublime, the visual effects are impressive, the editing is well-paced, and the score is simply astounding. If I had to make one criticism about the movie, that is its abrupt ending. That aside, I consider "The Truman Show" to be one of the most creative films ever made and one of my favorites. Way better than "Saving Private Ryan" and "Shakespeare in Love."

    "The Truman show" was a movie that shows Truman Burbank's life as a reality TV show, without his knowledge since his birth. Jim Carrey was Truman Burbank, and his wife Meryl Burbank played by Laura Linney. Truman's best friend Marlon was Noah Emmerich. Christof, The creator of the TV show, was Ed Harris. Jim Carrey was able to mix his silly comedy with thoughtful drama, and the script provided new experience on drama movies. Fighting for freedom, thinking of ways to run away, believing in his feelings, Jim Carrey performance was amazing. After having the curiosity that something is wrong, He tried many times to discover the way to run away, but most of the time he fails. Truman's courage increased in every scene in the movie. Christof was trying to keep Truman under control by directing the actors to what to do next. Until he decided that he was ready to die to get his freedom. Truman said, "Is that the best you can do? You gonna have to kill me." Also, every other actor in the movie tried to stop him from his wife, best friend, and secondary actors. Meryl tried to break him down every time he was thinking to travel by reminding him of their financial responsibility. "I think you should save for a few months, and then go," she said, she was laughing. Again, his friend tried to convince him that their city is the best place in the world by touching Truman's feelings by his words, "look at that sun set Truman, it is perfect." Every actor did a great job in this movie by involving their emotion in their acting, and that helped to make the audience connect emotionally with the movie. The romance, the drama, and the action in the movie had become from the script. The script helped the actors to have many ways to express their feelings by the words they were saying or by the action they were doing. Marlon said, "He is goon,", "Cut transmission," frustrated,Christof react. Additionally, it rearranged the idea of the drama movies by adding a little romance, action, and comedy to the drama to make the movie suitable to all tastes. Fighting against the storm,looking to the picture of his love, looking to the bright sun, Jim Carrey was successful in mixing all these feeling in one scene. Directed by Peter Weir, written by Andrew Niccol, starring by Jim Carrey, "The Truman Show" was a great movie to watch. It had a new experience that made it different from the rest of the drama movies. Skilled actors and a precise script made it one of the best movies that involve the audience emotionally and make them react with every scene. Truman was trapped in his life, and there were people controlling his live. That left viewers thinking if they trapped in their lives, or there is someone controlling their lives.

    Far from being a masterpiece, this film has something special to offer to the viewers. It's really enjoyable, fun and smart. Besides subtly criticizing the media and it's ways of manipulation this film was a true lesson to me. It made me think about the importance of living, knowing and discovering. Some of us fear change and can't easily get out of their comfort zone. I think it's a big deal to have the courage to leave your home, that place that made you who you are to face the world and get to know yourself better. The human mind is a very complex "toy" but also fragile. Sometimes we prefer living a lie because it gives us sort of a sense of security, sometimes we reject new experiences just because they are...new, sometimes we like to live in our own little universe for fear of the others. This film has many morals and it's up to each of us to discover one. For me, the moral was: It's never too late to escape from the perfect little world you've created or the others have created for you and start to LIVE for REAL!

    Amazing movie but guys your movie description ruined the entire twist of the movie... "An insurance salesman/adjuster discovers his entire life is actually a TV show." I knew from start what was happening... thanks!!! :) quoted from other: When I first saw 'The Truman Show' I came out of the theatre amazed. This is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal Jim Carrey movie. I love the dialogue, camera shot, performances, direction, music, and running time of this movie. There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from 'The Truman Show' feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.

    This is my 12th movie review on IMDb. First thing to say is that the entire movie plot - I have never seen/ heard a movie this original before. I have seen Jim Carrey in a some other movies like Bruce Almighty / Ace Ventura and other films were he is funny however for this film funny does not describe it enough !! this movie is funny , real , fun , charming , has heart , intriguing , juicy , touching , has a lot of soul in it , witty , clever and very unique in many ways. Well first before I talk about the movie I would like to say that Peter Weir seems to be a great director - although I have not seen his movie Witness that stars Harrison Ford( that people seem to mention the most on here ) I have seen Dead Poets Society and Fearless that I would say are underrated masterpieces ( i should review those movies on here soon ) !! and this film belongs in the masterpiece category as well it would only make logical sense for me to put ' Witness ' on my Netflix list to watch eventually. So let me talk about this movie a little bit here Truman Burbank is a star of a 24 hour TV show that he has no idea about when he starts to realizes something is wrong in his life his goal ? to be free - he has to " BREAK out of the CAGE " but who gets in the way Ignorant / stubborn / arrogant Christof who as well was brilliantly played the actor whose name is Ed Harris. He is the villain of the movie. Outstanding !!!! this movie is 100 % creative / great actors and Jim Carrey is real innocent emotional human. Ed Harris did a great job , there's a beautiful flow start to end with a wonderful ending of Truman , sound track is amazing , camera shots were greatly unique / lines * the movie had a bunch of great / comical one lines that i need to remember and script gets an A + its rare for a movie to get 10 out 10 however this one deserves it !!!!

    This movie is absolutely different from many movies. It's the only one I have ever seen like it. Also, think about it. What if you were being filmed? How would you find out? What if we're watching you right now ;)? What if I'm being watched :(? How would we know? That's the kind of life Jim Carrey lives in this movie.The ending is very great. His "creator" tells him he built a great life for him in this fake world. He says it's fake but better for him. Jim Carrey would rather live in the real world, with his real love, with real people, with real everything, instead of living this fake life where everyone is nice to him for being a celebrity and they get paid to do so.

    Peter Weir has casted well-known comedians into serious roles before with Robin Williams starring in Dead Poet's Society. We had to study this film in English and I actually got quite excited. This is an astounding movie and is done so well. Jim Carrey plays the main character, Truman Burbank (True-Man). Truman lives what he thinks is a normal life. He has a wife, a home, a friend he's known for most of his life and a desk-job at an insurance agency. What he doesn't realize is that he is actually a star in a 24 hour, live show which is showed all across the globe which documents like a soap-opera his life.The whole film tackles the themes of the power of the media and even religious themes about the God if you look hard enough as Truman starts to realize that his life is different from everyone around him. The script is more than perfect, the dialogue is wonderful and there is an excellent mix of heart-warming stuff as well as some comedy to lighten the mood (a necessity). The film is not too long, which is a good thing because a considerable length for a movie like this could ruin it. The acting is another stand-out along-side the excellent script. Jim Carrey does a great job and I can see how they casted him instead of another normal actor (Yes, Jim, you're not a normal actor). All the actors do a good job but keep an eye out for the man who plays Truman's friend, Marlon, who does amazing and a few scenes you would see why. There's nothing more I can really say about this film, it's thought-provoking, it's wonderfully scripted and acted. It has a few funny scenes to lighten the mood but overall its serious. I must say that it is not a popcorn film but it is also a film which is worth more than one viewing. Watch it twice in a week and you will understand a bit more of the themes and nuances which help create this world. This is the type of movie which really leaves an impression on you after you watch it. I promise you, this movie is not forgettable and you will be left thinking about it hours after the credits appear.

    We all are stuck at those unknown levels which are mysterious and still we are living those levels with all the emotions right from childhood to old age. This movie is one "Philosophical" and "Thought Provoking" movie and Mr. Jim is a real gem of Hollywood & how in this world he did not won Oscar for this performance? Right from start to finish this movie keep you "spell-bounded" and somehow it also reflects light upon "self-realization" & still its a complete entertainer and that's the beauty of "The Truman Show". In our Holy Scripture Mahabharata written by great sage Mr. Ved Vyas it is already written that this world is a biggest stage created by almighty and we all are just elements of his private show and we come and go to and from him according to our conducted deeds. Likewise everyone is "Actually" living "The Truman Show" and we always need courage to come out of our own cocoon of misconceptions because whatever we are doing just like Mr. Truman we already know in our heart about its correctness and vice-verse. I truly believe this movie is a must watch for every living being who call himself/herself resident of a planet named as - Earth.

    We all are stuck at those unknown levels which are mysterious and still we are living those levels with all the emotions right from childhood to old age. This movie is one "Philosophical" and "Thought Provoking" movie and Mr. Jim is a real gem of Hollywood & how in this world he did not won Oscar for this performance? Right from start to finish this movie keep you "spell-bounded" and somehow it also reflects light upon "self-realization" & still its a complete entertainer and that's the beauty of "The Truman Show". In our Holy Scripture Mahabharata written by great sage Mr. Ved Vyas it is already written that this world is a biggest stage created by almighty and we all are just elements of his private show and we come and go to and from him according to our conducted deeds. Likewise everyone is "Actually" living "The Truman Show" and we always need courage to come out of our own cocoon of misconceptions because whatever we are doing just like Mr. Truman we already know in our heart about its correctness and vice-verse. I truly believe this movie is a must watch for every living being who call himself/herself resident of a planet named as - Earth.

    The Truman Show has to be one of the most inventive and original films that I've ever seen. Jim Carrey and Laura Linney are the two lead performances of the film. Jim Carrey is unbelievable in this film as a young man that discovers his whole life is actually a TV show. One of those rare gems that we get and one of the best films of the 1990s. I used to watch this movie all the time and find it unbelievable to watch what happens with the plot and characters. A movie that I can really watch over and over again. I find Jim Carrey so talented because of all the types of roles that he can play in movies. I find all the movies that he stars in really fascinating and just a different experience. One of the easiest movies to appreciate which is something that I find interesting about it. I love how it ends and think that it's really a masterpiece. One of my favorite films of all - time. A sweet and beautiful movie that will also make you think.

    There are many entertaining films. Fewer are great ones. Even fewer are ones that are memorable and push the limit in terms of inventive creativity and pure originality. "The Truman Show" is such a tour de force. It is a film that is hard to describe. It is not quite a comedy though it is funny. Neither is it a drama though there are dramatic elements to it. "The Truman Show" can be a genre of its own: fantasy, science-fiction, comedy, drama, adventure, thriller--all fit into this movie. It is that unique. As a feeble attempt to explain the plot, this movie is about a man who lives a seemingly ordinary, middle-class life in suburbia, who happens to be filmed from every angle imaginable. The catch, he does not know about it. As bizarre factors begin to take place, he starts to question his identity and life around him. Like the millions of viewers who turn in to see Mr. Truman, we too are fascinated as to what he does next and "how it will end." Jim Carrey as Truman turns in perhaps his greatest performance (although Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was pretty good too). His trademark humor is left out and he becomes this individual trapped in a world that is beyond his control. The supporting cast is very solid, particularly Ed Harris as Christoph, the man behind the curtain so to speak. However, it is Carrey who steals the show, I mean, it is about him after all. Besides the acting, Peter Weir's direction is sublime, the visual effects are impressive, the editing is well-paced, and the score is simply astounding. If I had to make one criticism about the movie, that is its abrupt ending. That aside, I consider "The Truman Show" to be one of the most creative films ever made and one of my favorites. Way better than "Saving Private Ryan" and "Shakespeare in Love."

    "The Truman show" was a movie that shows Truman Burbank's life as a reality TV show, without his knowledge since his birth. Jim Carrey was Truman Burbank, and his wife Meryl Burbank played by Laura Linney. Truman's best friend Marlon was Noah Emmerich. Christof, The creator of the TV show, was Ed Harris. Jim Carrey was able to mix his silly comedy with thoughtful drama, and the script provided new experience on drama movies. Fighting for freedom, thinking of ways to run away, believing in his feelings, Jim Carrey performance was amazing. After having the curiosity that something is wrong, He tried many times to discover the way to run away, but most of the time he fails. Truman's courage increased in every scene in the movie. Christof was trying to keep Truman under control by directing the actors to what to do next. Until he decided that he was ready to die to get his freedom. Truman said, "Is that the best you can do? You gonna have to kill me." Also, every other actor in the movie tried to stop him from his wife, best friend, and secondary actors. Meryl tried to break him down every time he was thinking to travel by reminding him of their financial responsibility. "I think you should save for a few months, and then go," she said, she was laughing. Again, his friend tried to convince him that their city is the best place in the world by touching Truman's feelings by his words, "look at that sun set Truman, it is perfect." Every actor did a great job in this movie by involving their emotion in their acting, and that helped to make the audience connect emotionally with the movie. The romance, the drama, and the action in the movie had become from the script. The script helped the actors to have many ways to express their feelings by the words they were saying or by the action they were doing. Marlon said, "He is goon,", "Cut transmission," frustrated,Christof react. Additionally, it rearranged the idea of the drama movies by adding a little romance, action, and comedy to the drama to make the movie suitable to all tastes. Fighting against the storm,looking to the picture of his love, looking to the bright sun, Jim Carrey was successful in mixing all these feeling in one scene. Directed by Peter Weir, written by Andrew Niccol, starring by Jim Carrey, "The Truman Show" was a great movie to watch. It had a new experience that made it different from the rest of the drama movies. Skilled actors and a precise script made it one of the best movies that involve the audience emotionally and make them react with every scene. Truman was trapped in his life, and there were people controlling his live. That left viewers thinking if they trapped in their lives, or there is someone controlling their lives.

    Far from being a masterpiece, this film has something special to offer to the viewers. It's really enjoyable, fun and smart. Besides subtly criticizing the media and it's ways of manipulation this film was a true lesson to me. It made me think about the importance of living, knowing and discovering. Some of us fear change and can't easily get out of their comfort zone. I think it's a big deal to have the courage to leave your home, that place that made you who you are to face the world and get to know yourself better. The human mind is a very complex "toy" but also fragile. Sometimes we prefer living a lie because it gives us sort of a sense of security, sometimes we reject new experiences just because they are...new, sometimes we like to live in our own little universe for fear of the others. This film has many morals and it's up to each of us to discover one. For me, the moral was: It's never too late to escape from the perfect little world you've created or the others have created for you and start to LIVE for REAL!

    Amazing movie but guys your movie description ruined the entire twist of the movie... "An insurance salesman/adjuster discovers his entire life is actually a TV show." I knew from start what was happening... thanks!!! :) quoted from other: When I first saw 'The Truman Show' I came out of the theatre amazed. This is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal Jim Carrey movie. I love the dialogue, camera shot, performances, direction, music, and running time of this movie. There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from 'The Truman Show' feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.

    This is my 12th movie review on IMDb. First thing to say is that the entire movie plot - I have never seen/ heard a movie this original before. I have seen Jim Carrey in a some other movies like Bruce Almighty / Ace Ventura and other films were he is funny however for this film funny does not describe it enough !! this movie is funny , real , fun , charming , has heart , intriguing , juicy , touching , has a lot of soul in it , witty , clever and very unique in many ways. Well first before I talk about the movie I would like to say that Peter Weir seems to be a great director - although I have not seen his movie Witness that stars Harrison Ford( that people seem to mention the most on here ) I have seen Dead Poets Society and Fearless that I would say are underrated masterpieces ( i should review those movies on here soon ) !! and this film belongs in the masterpiece category as well it would only make logical sense for me to put ' Witness ' on my Netflix list to watch eventually. So let me talk about this movie a little bit here Truman Burbank is a star of a 24 hour TV show that he has no idea about when he starts to realizes something is wrong in his life his goal ? to be free - he has to " BREAK out of the CAGE " but who gets in the way Ignorant / stubborn / arrogant Christof who as well was brilliantly played the actor whose name is Ed Harris. He is the villain of the movie. Outstanding !!!! this movie is 100 % creative / great actors and Jim Carrey is real innocent emotional human. Ed Harris did a great job , there's a beautiful flow start to end with a wonderful ending of Truman , sound track is amazing , camera shots were greatly unique / lines * the movie had a bunch of great / comical one lines that i need to remember and script gets an A + its rare for a movie to get 10 out 10 however this one deserves it !!!!

    This movie is absolutely different from many movies. It's the only one I have ever seen like it. Also, think about it. What if you were being filmed? How would you find out? What if we're watching you right now ;)? What if I'm being watched :(? How would we know? That's the kind of life Jim Carrey lives in this movie.The ending is very great. His "creator" tells him he built a great life for him in this fake world. He says it's fake but better for him. Jim Carrey would rather live in the real world, with his real love, with real people, with real everything, instead of living this fake life where everyone is nice to him for being a celebrity and they get paid to do so.

    Peter Weir has casted well-known comedians into serious roles before with Robin Williams starring in Dead Poet's Society. We had to study this film in English and I actually got quite excited. This is an astounding movie and is done so well. Jim Carrey plays the main character, Truman Burbank (True-Man). Truman lives what he thinks is a normal life. He has a wife, a home, a friend he's known for most of his life and a desk-job at an insurance agency. What he doesn't realize is that he is actually a star in a 24 hour, live show which is showed all across the globe which documents like a soap-opera his life.The whole film tackles the themes of the power of the media and even religious themes about the God if you look hard enough as Truman starts to realize that his life is different from everyone around him. The script is more than perfect, the dialogue is wonderful and there is an excellent mix of heart-warming stuff as well as some comedy to lighten the mood (a necessity). The film is not too long, which is a good thing because a considerable length for a movie like this could ruin it. The acting is another stand-out along-side the excellent script. Jim Carrey does a great job and I can see how they casted him instead of another normal actor (Yes, Jim, you're not a normal actor). All the actors do a good job but keep an eye out for the man who plays Truman's friend, Marlon, who does amazing and a few scenes you would see why. There's nothing more I can really say about this film, it's thought-provoking, it's wonderfully scripted and acted. It has a few funny scenes to lighten the mood but overall its serious. I must say that it is not a popcorn film but it is also a film which is worth more than one viewing. Watch it twice in a week and you will understand a bit more of the themes and nuances which help create this world. This is the type of movie which really leaves an impression on you after you watch it. I promise you, this movie is not forgettable and you will be left thinking about it hours after the credits appear.

    We all are stuck at those unknown levels which are mysterious and still we are living those levels with all the emotions right from childhood to old age. This movie is one "Philosophical" and "Thought Provoking" movie and Mr. Jim is a real gem of Hollywood & how in this world he did not won Oscar for this performance? Right from start to finish this movie keep you "spell-bounded" and somehow it also reflects light upon "self-realization" & still its a complete entertainer and that's the beauty of "The Truman Show". In our Holy Scripture Mahabharata written by great sage Mr. Ved Vyas it is already written that this world is a biggest stage created by almighty and we all are just elements of his private show and we come and go to and from him according to our conducted deeds. Likewise everyone is "Actually" living "The Truman Show" and we always need courage to come out of our own cocoon of misconceptions because whatever we are doing just like Mr. Truman we already know in our heart about its correctness and vice-verse. I truly believe this movie is a must watch for every living being who call himself/herself resident of a planet named as - Earth.

This is an astounding movie and is done so well. Jim Carrey plays the main character, Truman Burbank (True-Man). Truman lives what he thinks is a normal life. He has a wife, a home, a friend he's known for most of his life and a desk-job at an insurance agency. What he doesn't realize is that he is actually a star in a 24 hour, live show which is showed all across the globe which documents like a soap-opera his life.The whole film tackles the themes of the power of the media and even religious themes about the God if you look hard enough as Truman starts to realize that his life is different from everyone around him. The script is more than perfect, the dialogue is wonderful and there is an excellent mix of heart-warming stuff as well as some comedy to lighten the mood (a necessity). The film is not too long, which is a good thing because a considerable length for a movie like this could ruin it. The acting is another stand-out along-side the excellent script. Jim Carrey does a great job and I can see how they casted him instead of another normal actor (Yes, Jim, you're not a normal actor). All the actors do a good job but keep an eye out for the man who plays Truman's friend, Marlon, who does amazing and a few scenes you would see why. There's nothing more I can really say about this film, it's thought-provoking, it's wonderfully scripted and acted. It has a few funny scenes to lighten the mood but overall its serious. I must say that it is not a popcorn film but it is also a film which is worth more than one viewing. Watch it twice in a week and you will understand a bit more of the themes and nuances which help create this world. This is the type of movie which really leaves an impression on you after you watch it. I promise you, this movie is not forgettable and you will be left thinking about it hours after the credits appear.

    We all are stuck at those unknown levels which are mysterious and still we are living those levels with all the emotions right from childhood to old age. This movie is one "Philosophical" and "Thought Provoking" movie and Mr. Jim is a real gem of Hollywood & how in this world he did not won Oscar for this performance? Right from start to finish this movie keep you "spell-bounded" and somehow it also reflects light upon "self-realization" & still its a complete entertainer and that's the beauty of "The Truman Show". In our Holy Scripture Mahabharata written by great sage Mr. Ved Vyas it is already written that this world is a biggest stage created by almighty and we all are just elements of his private show and we come and go to and from him according to our conducted deeds. Likewise everyone is "Actually" living "The Truman Show" and we always need courage to come out of our own cocoon of misconceptions because whatever we are doing just like Mr. Truman we already know in our heart about its correctness and vice-verse. I truly believe this movie is a must watch for every living being who call himself/herself resident of a planet named as - Earth.

    The Truman Show has to be one of the most inventive and original films that I've ever seen. Jim Carrey and Laura Linney are the two lead performances of the film. Jim Carrey is unbelievable in this film as a young man that discovers his whole life is actually a TV show. One of those rare gems that we get and one of the best films of the 1990s. I used to watch this movie all the time and find it unbelievable to watch what happens with the plot and characters. A movie that I can really watch over and over again. I find Jim Carrey so talented because of all the types of roles that he can play in movies. I find all the movies that he stars in really fascinating and just a different experience. One of the easiest movies to appreciate which is something that I find interesting about it. I love how it ends and think that it's really a masterpiece. One of my favorite films of all - time. A sweet and beautiful movie that will also make you think.

    There are many entertaining films. Fewer are great ones. Even fewer are ones that are memorable and push the limit in terms of inventive creativity and pure originality. "The Truman Show" is such a tour de force. It is a film that is hard to describe. It is not quite a comedy though it is funny. Neither is it a drama though there are dramatic elements to it. "The Truman Show" can be a genre of its own: fantasy, science-fiction, comedy, drama, adventure, thriller--all fit into this movie. It is that unique. As a feeble attempt to explain the plot, this movie is about a man who lives a seemingly ordinary, middle-class life in suburbia, who happens to be filmed from every angle imaginable. The catch, he does not know about it. As bizarre factors begin to take place, he starts to question his identity and life around him. Like the millions of viewers who turn in to see Mr. Truman, we too are fascinated as to what he does next and "how it will end." Jim Carrey as Truman turns in perhaps his greatest performance (although Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was pretty good too). His trademark humor is left out and he becomes this individual trapped in a world that is beyond his control. The supporting cast is very solid, particularly Ed Harris as Christoph, the man behind the curtain so to speak. However, it is Carrey who steals the show, I mean, it is about him after all. Besides the acting, Peter Weir's direction is sublime, the visual effects are impressive, the editing is well-paced, and the score is simply astounding. If I had to make one criticism about the movie, that is its abrupt ending. That aside, I consider "The Truman Show" to be one of the most creative films ever made and one of my favorites. Way better than "Saving Private Ryan" and "Shakespeare in Love."

    "The Truman show" was a movie that shows Truman Burbank's life as a reality TV show, without his knowledge since his birth. Jim Carrey was Truman Burbank, and his wife Meryl Burbank played by Laura Linney. Truman's best friend Marlon was Noah Emmerich. Christof, The creator of the TV show, was Ed Harris. Jim Carrey was able to mix his silly comedy with thoughtful drama, and the script provided new experience on drama movies. Fighting for freedom, thinking of ways to run away, believing in his feelings, Jim Carrey performance was amazing. After having the curiosity that something is wrong, He tried many times to discover the way to run away, but most of the time he fails. Truman's courage increased in every scene in the movie. Christof was trying to keep Truman under control by directing the actors to what to do next. Until he decided that he was ready to die to get his freedom. Truman said, "Is that the best you can do? You gonna have to kill me." Also, every other actor in the movie tried to stop him from his wife, best friend, and secondary actors. Meryl tried to break him down every time he was thinking to travel by reminding him of their financial responsibility. "I think you should save for a few months, and then go," she said, she was laughing. Again, his friend tried to convince him that their city is the best place in the world by touching Truman's feelings by his words, "look at that sun set Truman, it is perfect." Every actor did a great job in this movie by involving their emotion in their acting, and that helped to make the audience connect emotionally with the movie. The romance, the drama, and the action in the movie had become from the script. The script helped the actors to have many ways to express their feelings by the words they were saying or by the action they were doing. Marlon said, "He is goon,", "Cut transmission," frustrated,Christof react. Additionally, it rearranged the idea of the drama movies by adding a little romance, action, and comedy to the drama to make the movie suitable to all tastes. Fighting against the storm,looking to the picture of his love, looking to the bright sun, Jim Carrey was successful in mixing all these feeling in one scene. Directed by Peter Weir, written by Andrew Niccol, starring by Jim Carrey, "The Truman Show" was a great movie to watch. It had a new experience that made it different from the rest of the drama movies. Skilled actors and a precise script made it one of the best movies that involve the audience emotionally and make them react with every scene. Truman was trapped in his life, and there were people controlling his live. That left viewers thinking if they trapped in their lives, or there is someone controlling their lives.

    Far from being a masterpiece, this film has something special to offer to the viewers. It's really enjoyable, fun and smart. Besides subtly criticizing the media and it's ways of manipulation this film was a true lesson to me. It made me think about the importance of living, knowing and discovering. Some of us fear change and can't easily get out of their comfort zone. I think it's a big deal to have the courage to leave your home, that place that made you who you are to face the world and get to know yourself better. The human mind is a very complex "toy" but also fragile. Sometimes we prefer living a lie because it gives us sort of a sense of security, sometimes we reject new experiences just because they are...new, sometimes we like to live in our own little universe for fear of the others. This film has many morals and it's up to each of us to discover one. For me, the moral was: It's never too late to escape from the perfect little world you've created or the others have created for you and start to LIVE for REAL!

    Amazing movie but guys your movie description ruined the entire twist of the movie... "An insurance salesman/adjuster discovers his entire life is actually a TV show." I knew from start what was happening... thanks!!! :) quoted from other: When I first saw 'The Truman Show' I came out of the theatre amazed. This is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal Jim Carrey movie. I love the dialogue, camera shot, performances, direction, music, and running time of this movie. There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from 'The Truman Show' feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.

    This is my 12th movie review on IMDb. First thing to say is that the entire movie plot - I have never seen/ heard a movie this original before. I have seen Jim Carrey in a some other movies like Bruce Almighty / Ace Ventura and other films were he is funny however for this film funny does not describe it enough !! this movie is funny , real , fun , charming , has heart , intriguing , juicy , touching , has a lot of soul in it , witty , clever and very unique in many ways. Well first before I talk about the movie I would like to say that Peter Weir seems to be a great director - although I have not seen his movie Witness that stars Harrison Ford( that people seem to mention the most on here ) I have seen Dead Poets Society and Fearless that I would say are underrated masterpieces ( i should review those movies on here soon ) !! and this film belongs in the masterpiece category as well it would only make logical sense for me to put ' Witness ' on my Netflix list to watch eventually. So let me talk about this movie a little bit here Truman Burbank is a star of a 24 hour TV show that he has no idea about when he starts to realizes something is wrong in his life his goal ? to be free - he has to " BREAK out of the CAGE " but who gets in the way Ignorant / stubborn / arrogant Christof who as well was brilliantly played the actor whose name is Ed Harris. He is the villain of the movie. Outstanding !!!! this movie is 100 % creative / great actors and Jim Carrey is real innocent emotional human. Ed Harris did a great job , there's a beautiful flow start to end with a wonderful ending of Truman , sound track is amazing , camera shots were greatly unique / lines * the movie had a bunch of great / comical one lines that i need to remember and script gets an A + its rare for a movie to get 10 out 10 however this one deserves it !!!!

    This movie is absolutely different from many movies. It's the only one I have ever seen like it. Also, think about it. What if you were being filmed? How would you find out? What if we're watching you right now ;)? What if I'm being watched :(? How would we know? That's the kind of life Jim Carrey lives in this movie.The ending is very great. His "creator" tells him he built a great life for him in this fake world. He says it's fake but better for him. Jim Carrey would rather live in the real world, with his real love, with real people, with real everything, instead of living this fake life where everyone is nice to him for being a celebrity and they get paid to do so.

    This movie is absolutely different from many movies. It's the only one I have ever seen like it. Also, think about it. What if you were being filmed? How would you find out? What if we're watching you right now ;)? What if I'm being watched :(? How would we know? That's the kind of life Jim Carrey lives in this movie.The ending is very great. His "creator" tells him he built a great life for him in this fake world. He says it's fake but better for him. Jim Carrey would rather live in the real world, with his real love, with real people, with real everything, instead of living this fake life where everyone is nice to him for being a celebrity and they get paid to do so.

    Peter Weir has casted well-known comedians into serious roles before with Robin Williams starring in Dead Poet's Society. We had to study this film in English and I actually got quite excited. This is an astounding movie and is done so well. Jim Carrey plays the main character, Truman Burbank (True-Man). Truman lives what he thinks is a normal life. He has a wife, a home, a friend he's known for most of his life and a desk-job at an insurance agency. What he doesn't realize is that he is actually a star in a 24 hour, live show which is showed all across the globe which documents like a soap-opera his life.The whole film tackles the themes of the power of the media and even religious themes about the God if you look hard enough as Truman starts to realize that his life is different from everyone around him. The script is more than perfect, the dialogue is wonderful and there is an excellent mix of heart-warming stuff as well as some comedy to lighten the mood (a necessity). The film is not too long, which is a good thing because a considerable length for a movie like this could ruin it. The acting is another stand-out along-side the excellent script. Jim Carrey does a great job and I can see how they casted him instead of another normal actor (Yes, Jim, you're not a normal actor). All the actors do a good job but keep an eye out for the man who plays Truman's friend, Marlon, who does amazing and a few scenes you would see why. There's nothing more I can really say about this film, it's thought-provoking, it's wonderfully scripted and acted. It has a few funny scenes to lighten the mood but overall its serious. I must say that it is not a popcorn film but it is also a film which is worth more than one viewing. Watch it twice in a week and you will understand a bit more of the themes and nuances which help create this world. This is the type of movie which really leaves an impression on you after you watch it. I promise you, this movie is not forgettable and you will be left thinking about it hours after the credits appear.

    We all are stuck at those unknown levels which are mysterious and still we are living those levels with all the emotions right from childhood to old age. This movie is one "Philosophical" and "Thought Provoking" movie and Mr. Jim is a real gem of Hollywood & how in this world he did not won Oscar for this performance? Right from start to finish this movie keep you "spell-bounded" and somehow it also reflects light upon "self-realization" & still its a complete entertainer and that's the beauty of "The Truman Show". In our Holy Scripture Mahabharata written by great sage Mr. Ved Vyas it is already written that this world is a biggest stage created by almighty and we all are just elements of his private show and we come and go to and from him according to our conducted deeds. Likewise everyone is "Actually" living "The Truman Show" and we always need courage to come out of our own cocoon of misconceptions because whatever we are doing just like Mr. Truman we already know in our heart about its correctness and vice-verse. I truly believe this movie is a must watch for every living being who call himself/herself resident of a planet named as - Earth.

    The Truman Show has to be one of the most inventive and original films that I've ever seen. Jim Carrey and Laura Linney are the two lead performances of the film. Jim Carrey is unbelievable in this film as a young man that discovers his whole life is actually a TV show. One of those rare gems that we get and one of the best films of the 1990s. I used to watch this movie all the time and find it unbelievable to watch what happens with the plot and characters. A movie that I can really watch over and over again. I find Jim Carrey so talented because of all the types of roles that he can play in movies. I find all the movies that he stars in really fascinating and just a different experience. One of the easiest movies to appreciate which is something that I find interesting about it. I love how it ends and think that it's really a masterpiece. One of my favorite films of all - time. A sweet and beautiful movie that will also make you think.

    There are many entertaining films. Fewer are great ones. Even fewer are ones that are memorable and push the limit in terms of inventive creativity and pure originality. "The Truman Show" is such a tour de force. It is a film that is hard to describe. It is not quite a comedy though it is funny. Neither is it a drama though there are dramatic elements to it. "The Truman Show" can be a genre of its own: fantasy, science-fiction, comedy, drama, adventure, thriller--all fit into this movie. It is that unique. As a feeble attempt to explain the plot, this movie is about a man who lives a seemingly ordinary, middle-class life in suburbia, who happens to be filmed from every angle imaginable. The catch, he does not know about it. As bizarre factors begin to take place, he starts to question his identity and life around him. Like the millions of viewers who turn in to see Mr. Truman, we too are fascinated as to what he does next and "how it will end." Jim Carrey as Truman turns in perhaps his greatest performance (although Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was pretty good too). His trademark humor is left out and he becomes this individual trapped in a world that is beyond his control. The supporting cast is very solid, particularly Ed Harris as Christoph, the man behind the curtain so to speak. However, it is Carrey who steals the show, I mean, it is about him after all. Besides the acting, Peter Weir's direction is sublime, the visual effects are impressive, the editing is well-paced, and the score is simply astounding. If I had to make one criticism about the movie, that is its abrupt ending. That aside, I consider "The Truman Show" to be one of the most creative films ever made and one of my favorites. Way better than "Saving Private Ryan" and "Shakespeare in Love."

    "The Truman show" was a movie that shows Truman Burbank's life as a reality TV show, without his knowledge since his birth. Jim Carrey was Truman Burbank, and his wife Meryl Burbank played by Laura Linney. Truman's best friend Marlon was Noah Emmerich. Christof, The creator of the TV show, was Ed Harris. Jim Carrey was able to mix his silly comedy with thoughtful drama, and the script provided new experience on drama movies. Fighting for freedom, thinking of ways to run away, believing in his feelings, Jim Carrey performance was amazing. After having the curiosity that something is wrong, He tried many times to discover the way to run away, but most of the time he fails. Truman's courage increased in every scene in the movie. Christof was trying to keep Truman under control by directing the actors to what to do next. Until he decided that he was ready to die to get his freedom. Truman said, "Is that the best you can do? You gonna have to kill me." Also, every other actor in the movie tried to stop him from his wife, best friend, and secondary actors. Meryl tried to break him down every time he was thinking to travel by reminding him of their financial responsibility. "I think you should save for a few months, and then go," she said, she was laughing. Again, his friend tried to convince him that their city is the best place in the world by touching Truman's feelings by his words, "look at that sun set Truman, it is perfect." Every actor did a great job in this movie by involving their emotion in their acting, and that helped to make the audience connect emotionally with the movie. The romance, the drama, and the action in the movie had become from the script. The script helped the actors to have many ways to express their feelings by the words they were saying or by the action they were doing. Marlon said, "He is goon,", "Cut transmission," frustrated,Christof react. Additionally, it rearranged the idea of the drama movies by adding a little romance, action, and comedy to the drama to make the movie suitable to all tastes. Fighting against the storm,looking to the picture of his love, looking to the bright sun, Jim Carrey was successful in mixing all these feeling in one scene. Directed by Peter Weir, written by Andrew Niccol, starring by Jim Carrey, "The Truman Show" was a great movie to watch. It had a new experience that made it different from the rest of the drama movies. Skilled actors and a precise script made it one of the best movies that involve the audience emotionally and make them react with every scene. Truman was trapped in his life, and there were people controlling his live. That left viewers thinking if they trapped in their lives, or there is someone controlling their lives.

    Far from being a masterpiece, this film has something special to offer to the viewers. It's really enjoyable, fun and smart. Besides subtly criticizing the media and it's ways of manipulation this film was a true lesson to me. It made me think about the importance of living, knowing and discovering. Some of us fear change and can't easily get out of their comfort zone. I think it's a big deal to have the courage to leave your home, that place that made you who you are to face the world and get to know yourself better. The human mind is a very complex "toy" but also fragile. Sometimes we prefer living a lie because it gives us sort of a sense of security, sometimes we reject new experiences just because they are...new, sometimes we like to live in our own little universe for fear of the others. This film has many morals and it's up to each of us to discover one. For me, the moral was: It's never too late to escape from the perfect little world you've created or the others have created for you and start to LIVE for REAL!

    Amazing movie but guys your movie description ruined the entire twist of the movie... "An insurance salesman/adjuster discovers his entire life is actually a TV show." I knew from start what was happening... thanks!!! :) quoted from other: When I first saw 'The Truman Show' I came out of the theatre amazed. This is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal Jim Carrey movie. I love the dialogue, camera shot, performances, direction, music, and running time of this movie. There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from 'The Truman Show' feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.

    This is my 12th movie review on IMDb. First thing to say is that the entire movie plot - I have never seen/ heard a movie this original before. I have seen Jim Carrey in a some other movies like Bruce Almighty / Ace Ventura and other films were he is funny however for this film funny does not describe it enough !! this movie is funny , real , fun , charming , has heart , intriguing , juicy , touching , has a lot of soul in it , witty , clever and very unique in many ways. Well first before I talk about the movie I would like to say that Peter Weir seems to be a great director - although I have not seen his movie Witness that stars Harrison Ford( that people seem to mention the most on here ) I have seen Dead Poets Society and Fearless that I would say are underrated masterpieces ( i should review those movies on here soon ) !! and this film belongs in the masterpiece category as well it would only make logical sense for me to put ' Witness ' on my Netflix list to watch eventually. So let me talk about this movie a little bit here Truman Burbank is a star of a 24 hour TV show that he has no idea about when he starts to realizes something is wrong in his life his goal ? to be free - he has to " BREAK out of the CAGE " but who gets in the way Ignorant / stubborn / arrogant Christof who as well was brilliantly played the actor whose name is Ed Harris. He is the villain of the movie. Outstanding !!!! this movie is 100 % creative / great actors and Jim Carrey is real innocent emotional human. Ed Harris did a great job , there's a beautiful flow start to end with a wonderful ending of Truman , sound track is amazing , camera shots were greatly unique / lines * the movie had a bunch of great / comical one lines that i need to remember and script gets an A + its rare for a movie to get 10 out 10 however this one deserves it !!!!

There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from 'The Truman Show' feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.

    This is my 12th movie review on IMDb. First thing to say is that the entire movie plot - I have never seen/ heard a movie this original before. I have seen Jim Carrey in a some other movies like Bruce Almighty / Ace Ventura and other films were he is funny however for this film funny does not describe it enough !! this movie is funny , real , fun , charming , has heart , intriguing , juicy , touching , has a lot of soul in it , witty , clever and very unique in many ways. Well first before I talk about the movie I would like to say that Peter Weir seems to be a great director - although I have not seen his movie Witness that stars Harrison Ford( that people seem to mention the most on here ) I have seen Dead Poets Society and Fearless that I would say are underrated masterpieces ( i should review those movies on here soon ) !! and this film belongs in the masterpiece category as well it would only make logical sense for me to put ' Witness ' on my Netflix list to watch eventually. So let me talk about this movie a little bit here Truman Burbank is a star of a 24 hour TV show that he has no idea about when he starts to realizes something is wrong in his life his goal ? to be free - he has to " BREAK out of the CAGE " but who gets in the way Ignorant / stubborn / arrogant Christof who as well was brilliantly played the actor whose name is Ed Harris. He is the villain of the movie. Outstanding !!!! this movie is 100 % creative / great actors and Jim Carrey is real innocent emotional human. Ed Harris did a great job , there's a beautiful flow start to end with a wonderful ending of Truman , sound track is amazing , camera shots were greatly unique / lines * the movie had a bunch of great / comical one lines that i need to remember and script gets an A + its rare for a movie to get 10 out 10 however this one deserves it !!!!

    This movie is absolutely different from many movies. It's the only one I have ever seen like it. Also, think about it. What if you were being filmed? How would you find out? What if we're watching you right now ;)? What if I'm being watched :(? How would we know? That's the kind of life Jim Carrey lives in this movie.The ending is very great. His "creator" tells him he built a great life for him in this fake world. He says it's fake but better for him. Jim Carrey would rather live in the real world, with his real love, with real people, with real everything, instead of living this fake life where everyone is nice to him for being a celebrity and they get paid to do so.

    Peter Weir has casted well-known comedians into serious roles before with Robin Williams starring in Dead Poet's Society. We had to study this film in English and I actually got quite excited. This is an astounding movie and is done so well. Jim Carrey plays the main character, Truman Burbank (True-Man). Truman lives what he thinks is a normal life. He has a wife, a home, a friend he's known for most of his life and a desk-job at an insurance agency. What he doesn't realize is that he is actually a star in a 24 hour, live show which is showed all across the globe which documents like a soap-opera his life.The whole film tackles the themes of the power of the media and even religious themes about the God if you look hard enough as Truman starts to realize that his life is different from everyone around him. The script is more than perfect, the dialogue is wonderful and there is an excellent mix of heart-warming stuff as well as some comedy to lighten the mood (a necessity). The film is not too long, which is a good thing because a considerable length for a movie like this could ruin it. The acting is another stand-out along-side the excellent script. Jim Carrey does a great job and I can see how they casted him instead of another normal actor (Yes, Jim, you're not a normal actor). All the actors do a good job but keep an eye out for the man who plays Truman's friend, Marlon, who does amazing and a few scenes you would see why. There's nothing more I can really say about this film, it's thought-provoking, it's wonderfully scripted and acted. It has a few funny scenes to lighten the mood but overall its serious. I must say that it is not a popcorn film but it is also a film which is worth more than one viewing. Watch it twice in a week and you will understand a bit more of the themes and nuances which help create this world. This is the type of movie which really leaves an impression on you after you watch it. I promise you, this movie is not forgettable and you will be left thinking about it hours after the credits appear.

    We all are stuck at those unknown levels which are mysterious and still we are living those levels with all the emotions right from childhood to old age. This movie is one "Philosophical" and "Thought Provoking" movie and Mr. Jim is a real gem of Hollywood & how in this world he did not won Oscar for this performance? Right from start to finish this movie keep you "spell-bounded" and somehow it also reflects light upon "self-realization" & still its a complete entertainer and that's the beauty of "The Truman Show". In our Holy Scripture Mahabharata written by great sage Mr. Ved Vyas it is already written that this world is a biggest stage created by almighty and we all are just elements of his private show and we come and go to and from him according to our conducted deeds. Likewise everyone is "Actually" living "The Truman Show" and we always need courage to come out of our own cocoon of misconceptions because whatever we are doing just like Mr. Truman we already know in our heart about its correctness and vice-verse. I truly believe this movie is a must watch for every living being who call himself/herself resident of a planet named as - Earth.

    The Truman Show has to be one of the most inventive and original films that I've ever seen. Jim Carrey and Laura Linney are the two lead performances of the film. Jim Carrey is unbelievable in this film as a young man that discovers his whole life is actually a TV show. One of those rare gems that we get and one of the best films of the 1990s. I used to watch this movie all the time and find it unbelievable to watch what happens with the plot and characters. A movie that I can really watch over and over again. I find Jim Carrey so talented because of all the types of roles that he can play in movies. I find all the movies that he stars in really fascinating and just a different experience. One of the easiest movies to appreciate which is something that I find interesting about it. I love how it ends and think that it's really a masterpiece. One of my favorite films of all - time. A sweet and beautiful movie that will also make you think.

    There are many entertaining films. Fewer are great ones. Even fewer are ones that are memorable and push the limit in terms of inventive creativity and pure originality. "The Truman Show" is such a tour de force. It is a film that is hard to describe. It is not quite a comedy though it is funny. Neither is it a drama though there are dramatic elements to it. "The Truman Show" can be a genre of its own: fantasy, science-fiction, comedy, drama, adventure, thriller--all fit into this movie. It is that unique. As a feeble attempt to explain the plot, this movie is about a man who lives a seemingly ordinary, middle-class life in suburbia, who happens to be filmed from every angle imaginable. The catch, he does not know about it. As bizarre factors begin to take place, he starts to question his identity and life around him. Like the millions of viewers who turn in to see Mr. Truman, we too are fascinated as to what he does next and "how it will end." Jim Carrey as Truman turns in perhaps his greatest performance (although Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was pretty good too). His trademark humor is left out and he becomes this individual trapped in a world that is beyond his control. The supporting cast is very solid, particularly Ed Harris as Christoph, the man behind the curtain so to speak. However, it is Carrey who steals the show, I mean, it is about him after all. Besides the acting, Peter Weir's direction is sublime, the visual effects are impressive, the editing is well-paced, and the score is simply astounding. If I had to make one criticism about the movie, that is its abrupt ending. That aside, I consider "The Truman Show" to be one of the most creative films ever made and one of my favorites. Way better than "Saving Private Ryan" and "Shakespeare in Love."
