    This French film featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die was obviously not one I had heard of before until reading about it, the title certainly sounded interesting, and I was hoping it would be deserving of its placement in the book. Basically this is filmed like it is a fly on a wall documentary, as a camera crew follow serial killer and thief Ben (Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde) around as he goes about his everyday routine and life, good and bad, and with holding nothing back. Ben boasts his architectural failures, his interest in writing poetry and listening to classic music, and we see him spend time with his girlfriend, but also boasting and carrying out murders, which he sees as his craft. With the cameras capturing his activities Ben soon involves the camera crew in his escapades, and they question whether what they are filming and continuing with their film is really a good idea. When Ben murders he has no specific victims, he targets random people, most being the older generation, but also he is profoundly misogynistic, a racist xenophobe (hates foreigners) and finds postmen his favourite targets kills these types. In the end Ben finds himself the victim of crime when he finds parents and girlfriend have been murdered by someone taking revenge, and he makes his farewells on camera to the crew, but an unseen gunman kills him and the crew members one by one. Also starring R&eacute;my Belvaux as Reporter, Andr&eacute; Bonzel as Cameraman, Jacqueline Poelvoorde-Pappaert as Ben's Mother, Nelly Pappaert as Ben's Grandmother, Hector Pappaert as Ben's Grandfather, Jenny Drye as Jenny and Malou Madou as Malou. I can imagine the controversy that this film brought in its day, where it would have got complaints for sensationalising violence and murder (Natural Born Killers did a similar thing years later), but whatever people think of it, it is a bold contribution to the genre, I admit I couldn't follow it all fully, but in general it is a worthwhile satirical black comedy. Good!

    I consider it a brilliant film, but also very very disturbing. I'd sooner warn people about it than recommend it, even though it's an amazing achievement. So, for what it's worth, here's my viewing experience: I heard about this film and was immediately hooked on the absurd idea of a serial killer, on the loose, as a willing documentary subject. I also heard that it was pitch-black comedy, and a commentary on violence, society, media, etc. -- blurring the lines between observing and becoming an accomplice and whatnot. Well, in the first two acts it certainly delivers on the absurdity and the black comedy. Both Ben and the filmmakers are as matter-of-fact about his prolific killing as if it were a documentary about urban architecture, and even in the middle of his murderous acts he remains an engaging conversationalist with all sorts of attributes our culture values: extroversion, confidence, charm, a sense of humor, and fairly informed views on diverse subjects. The juxtapositions are disturbingly hilarious. He laments that African immigrants like the one he just shot don't have equal opportunities in this racist society, or that the color and layout of a certain housing project encourages violence and other social evils. He kills an entire family in their home, then reflects on the waste of human life and how there "should be a law" against that sort of thing. He explains a lot of aspects of his trade (like how to dispose of bodies and which victims are most likely to carry money), but leaves other elements in the dark. He first seems like a murderous variety of the common robber, but then plenty of killings seem to have no material motive at all, while others are clashes with rival killers (the absurdity reaches meta-levels at some points). I was shocked by the violence and I was also laughing, and I was feeling uneasy about that. Many reviews talk about how the documentary crew moves from "observers" to "accomplices", but any court of law would already consider them "accomplices" within one minute of the film starting, so that development didn't register so much to me. Sure they started taking a more active part in the carnage, but this wasn't something I considered an unexpected development. What did register to me was the shift somewhere in the third act. Suddenly I was no longer watching a dark comedy. The violence escalates to a nasty scene that I couldn't even watch, and that left me disturbed and depressed for days. It's like the movie finally decided to show me what I was looking at and say, "well, are you still laughing? Are you?" And I realized: what was there about Ben that was engaging? Even his charming ways among his friends and family were just socially acceptable methods of getting his way and remaining the center of attention, just like killing people and starring in documentaries. So among the unexpected things I found in this film was a chillingly believable portrait of a textbook sociopath. (The scary thing is that I know someone in my neighborhood who fits that profile as well.) The film is brilliant and disturbing. Proceed at your own risk.

    On the shelf of disturbing movies, Man bites dog will earn a place without even breaking a sweat. While "A Clockwork Orange" is stylized violence, this is your everyday garden variety of butchery. Filmed in a black and white documentary style, the camera crew follow Ben - part serial-killer, part hit-man, part petty thief - as he indulges in a variety of violent acts. Unlike most documentaries, however, the crew starts off as bystanders to Ben's "work" but go on to become participants leading to a twisted destructive symbiotic relationship. Ben is a killer - He kills for paid assignments, kills as a part of robbery, and sometimes even out of sheer annoyance Aside from his day job, it is simply one of his techniques of problem resolution. He does not enjoy the pain inflicted but rather has a preternatural level amorality and lack of empathy. In one of the scenes he shoots an obnoxiously loud acquaintance in the head without warning or fuss and resumes eating dinner. It is dark humor at its best; The camera timing on this particular shot is outstanding - panning between a man lying with a head shot, and the shooter consuming his meal with quick fork movements at the dinner table. Gangly and awkward at times, Ben is most easily identifiable as the lonely office worker with the uniquely European sense of (misplaced mostly) self-worth resulting in a pseudo-intellectual commentary on topics ranging from architecture to art to music. He goes about his work in a competent but non-flamboyant manner, much like an insurance auditor would. But you are acutely aware that if there was competition, he wouldn't be the best hit-man - just an average one. That he is not a meticulous serial killer is humorously evident when he finds that his body dumping ground is clearly visible from two hundred feet away with bones sticking out in every direction. Ben's only acknowledgement of society seems to be the egotistical need to ensure that the film is completed. Initially awkward in front of the camera and it's "artistic" crew, he quickly enjoys the attention. The crew perceive this weaknesses and proceed to exploit it in the opportunistic manner only the continental artsy type knows how; Even goading him on to go beyond his usual modus operandi to rob a suburban home - only to find that rich suburbans only keep credit cards at home and no cash. The film works hard at at many levels to ensure that the viewer cannot distance himself from the movie. The documentary style is only one aspect of this. Discerning viewers cannot categorize Ben with any mental illness because unlike clinical conditions that describe lack of empathy, Ben does maintain semi-functional family relationships and friendships; He also has both appreciation and moderate skills for music and sport - Piano and Boxing. Conversely, there is no opportunity to develop any sympathy for Ben either as he mercilessly smothers a ten year old boy. And that is the brilliance of the film - Adroitly manipulating the viewer's mind and shaking away any predilection to slot away Ben as an aberration. Forcing the viewer to accept Ben's existence as fact; accept society's helplessness at ever reforming or redeeming Ben; accept that for a turn of chance, they might be the next random victims of Ben. Multiple side-plots efficiently explored give a depth to the narrative that goes beyond the 95 minutes of running time. The most interesting side-plot is his relationship with the crew. The crew, through their meanness and pettiness, create a temporary sense of sympathy for Ben. It is easier to relate to the lone misfit who is cruelly unaware that he is being mocked than to the snobbish crew with their disheveled artsy attire and unwashed hippy hair. Their own baseness is evident when they are willing partners in a bout of rape facilitated by Ben and his ever present gun. While Ben is the skilled panther fending for himself, they are the hyenas of society feeding off the scraps. The situational and temporary power shifts are blindingly realistic. Eventually though, there is no conceptualization of redemption for a man like Ben. Even when his girlfriend and mother are brutally killed - his remorse comes from a selfish loss of relationship, not love. Revenge for such an act is simply a matter of professional courtesy for Ben and personal grief is only incidental. Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde is outstanding as Ben - from every drunken facial tic to the professional manner of hunting down his victims. Benoit masterfully represents Ben as a human with all the petty pride and insecurities that go with it even while indulging in demonically violent acts. A disturbingly brilliant movie - with each scene worthy of expostulation - punctuated regularly with points of high black humor, Man bites dog is an enduring cult classic.

    Me and my mate went to see this film in 1992 when it came out. We were 20 something nobodies in London. It was the only friend we had and I think it still is!!!! We howled all the way through. The sangfroid with which the killer dispatches his victims. The gutless bumbling of the film crew were just brilliant. The pieces to camera were great as was the black and white photography. If I could get a copy of the poster I would hang it on my wall! Perfect for 20 something nobodies and one of the best experiences I have had in the cinema.

    I just saw the movie bout ten minutes ago and the second it finished I felt dirty. The movie makes you laugh at things that you wouldn't ever think you would be able to laugh to. The characters are a weird mix of extremely likable and extremely unlikeable. The movie has two scenes which made me want to fast forward 1. The rape scene 2. The child murder scene.The only problem i have with the film is that at times it get a little two slow and to much talking and the ending was a tiny bit too sudden. Overall it was a very funny and disturbing film which I'm not sure if I could watch it again soon because of the extremely hard to watch rape scene, I gave it a 8 out of 10.

    Everybody shut up please, and listen. I am from Belgium, so I have a right to speak. Hear ye! Hear ye! No, seriously, everybody's opinion is worth as much as the next one, I'm just joking, but I want to write a few words about this movie, so people can understand it better. First of all, some people don't realise that this film was made with a budget of less than 50.000 dollar. The actors in the movie are mostly family and friends. Benoit Poelvoorde, who plays the main role, is the only professional, and he delivers a fantastic performance as the talkative, self-absorbed, hyperbolic, maniac Ben, we all come to love. It was the role of his life. The director and sound engineers had just graduated film school. They still had a lot to learn. So you have to give the makers credit for that. Knowing all this, you understand this has to be seen as a cult-movie. A cult-movie, with a great script, witty dialogues, and legendary scenes. With a great sense of irony. My favourite scenes of Man bites Dog are the chase in the abandoned factory (with the pigeon poem), and the bar scene, ending with Benoit Poelvoorde singing the cinema song, with fake beard. Most film fans in Belgium can recite whole passages upon request. The ending is a bit abrupt, and some scenes are superfluous, but the film has the streak of genius all the way through. Hope you enjoy it.

    Well I've had my fair share of disturbing films, from Martyrs to Inside (also French films) but what sets Man Bites Dog apart from other French horror is the sheer realism. I was scared that the film would just be a man going around killing people, and essentially it just is. But nevertheless it is a strangely compelling and gripping film that has a serious message about the desensitisation of violence in films. I was laughing at it at the start, but then things stop become being funny, pretty much as soon as he kills the old woman in such an unsettling manner. The killing of children is also something I found particularly shocking, but I suppose that's what made the film so compelling, the protagonist is such an unusual and highly unpredictable character. It's impossible to know what he's going to do next and some scenes really did have the power to shock. Overall, I think Man Bites Dog did suffer from a lack of narrative drive and a predictable ending, however it was still a captivating experience, and one I'm not likely to forget.

    A cerebral hybrid between "Monty Python", "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" and "American Psycho", "Man Bites Dog" is one such film that certainly lives up to its underground reputation. The film's grainy black-and-white photography sets up the overall tone as the viewer goes on a violent, blackly-humorous joyride masquerading as an actual documentary. Meet Benoit Poelvoorde, a clever, cultured, quick-witted, well-liked young man. A seemingly normal man with a fondness for mussels, running down the beach in the nude and most of all, he kills innocent people for a living. Cameraman Andre Bonzel and reporter Remy Belvaux are on hand to film the mundane activities of Ben's daily life along with his friends and family. Unfortunately, the two men begin to realize that their archetypal subject is doing more than just being Mr. Nice Guy. From losing his cherished ID bracelet to accidentally killing a birthday party goer, Ben becomes more than just your garden-variety serial killer in the movies. While viewing the film numerous times, I don't know what my natural reaction would be whether to laugh or be horrified. The final reaction would be both. Yes, the film is indeed shockingly violent, offensively funny and proud of it. But thanks to Poelvoorde's naturalistic performance, we know "Man Bites Dog" will be an out-of-this-world experience filled with manic glee and intense energy. The main saying goes: "No rules, no consequences." Which reminds me of that fine American institution for censorship? The Motion Picture Association of America better known as the MPAA. "Man Bites Dog" makes sense for receiving the dreaded NC-17 rating. While the latter rating is usually reserved for sexually-themed films like SHOWGIRLS, it is finally put to proper use for a movie with such realistic depictions of violence. Forget "Blair Witch." Forget "Paranormal Activity." And forget "Quarantine." Those so-called "home video" genre movies don't hold a candle to the pure down-and-dirty celluloid that is "Man Bites Dog." The best film of 1992. Viva Cinema!

    Wow. What a disturbing film. It sure packs a wallop. It is suppose to be a black/comedy but I did not find anything amusing about it. Except for the hospital scene when our so-called hero "Ben" is bothered by the "smell" of his neighbor in the next bed who all day just, "s*^ts and sings all a day!" There are plenty of very disturbing scenes in these so-called comedy. but i could not pull myself away from watching it till the very end. It's just like the movie, Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer with Michael Rooker. This guy Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde exhibits some strange charismatic quality about him even if he is playing a most despicable character. I guess in the end I wanted too see him get his just desserts for all the pain and violent things that he did.I felt no remorse for his crew of film-boy/fan-boys that are getting killed along the way for being with this crazy, insane psycho. When they finally cross the line and become part of the madness it is just too much. they deserve what they get as far as I'm concerned. All in all it's one of those films that stays on your mind because of certain scenes. So if you are not in to this kind, stay away. Anyone else proceed at your own risk.

    I can't believe that some people consider it as a cult movie. One guy (serial killer and psychopath) very talkative, kills and destroys anything he wants to for a pleasure and tried to find out the purpose of his behavior in the front of the camera that follows him. This is very cheap movie without any sense. The main protagonist thinks he is smart and keep talking about his life while killing other people, robs their money and throws corpses over some kind of bridge while explaining the technique. In the end he got killed for causing troubles to the other gangsters. The crew that follows his crime and record it is sick and dumb too and off course got killed too. Is this kind of a movie that you wanted to see? Just sickness.

    Me and my mate went to see this film in 1992 when it came out. We were 20 something nobodies in London. It was the only friend we had and I think it still is!!!! We howled all the way through. The sangfroid with which the killer dispatches his victims. The gutless bumbling of the film crew were just brilliant. The pieces to camera were great as was the black and white photography. If I could get a copy of the poster I would hang it on my wall! Perfect for 20 something nobodies and one of the best experiences I have had in the cinema.

    I just saw the movie bout ten minutes ago and the second it finished I felt dirty. The movie makes you laugh at things that you wouldn't ever think you would be able to laugh to. The characters are a weird mix of extremely likable and extremely unlikeable. The movie has two scenes which made me want to fast forward 1. The rape scene 2. The child murder scene.The only problem i have with the film is that at times it get a little two slow and to much talking and the ending was a tiny bit too sudden. Overall it was a very funny and disturbing film which I'm not sure if I could watch it again soon because of the extremely hard to watch rape scene, I gave it a 8 out of 10.

    Everybody shut up please, and listen. I am from Belgium, so I have a right to speak. Hear ye! Hear ye! No, seriously, everybody's opinion is worth as much as the next one, I'm just joking, but I want to write a few words about this movie, so people can understand it better. First of all, some people don't realise that this film was made with a budget of less than 50.000 dollar. The actors in the movie are mostly family and friends. Benoit Poelvoorde, who plays the main role, is the only professional, and he delivers a fantastic performance as the talkative, self-absorbed, hyperbolic, maniac Ben, we all come to love. It was the role of his life. The director and sound engineers had just graduated film school. They still had a lot to learn. So you have to give the makers credit for that. Knowing all this, you understand this has to be seen as a cult-movie. A cult-movie, with a great script, witty dialogues, and legendary scenes. With a great sense of irony. My favourite scenes of Man bites Dog are the chase in the abandoned factory (with the pigeon poem), and the bar scene, ending with Benoit Poelvoorde singing the cinema song, with fake beard. Most film fans in Belgium can recite whole passages upon request. The ending is a bit abrupt, and some scenes are superfluous, but the film has the streak of genius all the way through. Hope you enjoy it.

    Well I've had my fair share of disturbing films, from Martyrs to Inside (also French films) but what sets Man Bites Dog apart from other French horror is the sheer realism. I was scared that the film would just be a man going around killing people, and essentially it just is. But nevertheless it is a strangely compelling and gripping film that has a serious message about the desensitisation of violence in films. I was laughing at it at the start, but then things stop become being funny, pretty much as soon as he kills the old woman in such an unsettling manner. The killing of children is also something I found particularly shocking, but I suppose that's what made the film so compelling, the protagonist is such an unusual and highly unpredictable character. It's impossible to know what he's going to do next and some scenes really did have the power to shock. Overall, I think Man Bites Dog did suffer from a lack of narrative drive and a predictable ending, however it was still a captivating experience, and one I'm not likely to forget.

    A cerebral hybrid between "Monty Python", "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" and "American Psycho", "Man Bites Dog" is one such film that certainly lives up to its underground reputation. The film's grainy black-and-white photography sets up the overall tone as the viewer goes on a violent, blackly-humorous joyride masquerading as an actual documentary. Meet Benoit Poelvoorde, a clever, cultured, quick-witted, well-liked young man. A seemingly normal man with a fondness for mussels, running down the beach in the nude and most of all, he kills innocent people for a living. Cameraman Andre Bonzel and reporter Remy Belvaux are on hand to film the mundane activities of Ben's daily life along with his friends and family. Unfortunately, the two men begin to realize that their archetypal subject is doing more than just being Mr. Nice Guy. From losing his cherished ID bracelet to accidentally killing a birthday party goer, Ben becomes more than just your garden-variety serial killer in the movies. While viewing the film numerous times, I don't know what my natural reaction would be whether to laugh or be horrified. The final reaction would be both. Yes, the film is indeed shockingly violent, offensively funny and proud of it. But thanks to Poelvoorde's naturalistic performance, we know "Man Bites Dog" will be an out-of-this-world experience filled with manic glee and intense energy. The main saying goes: "No rules, no consequences." Which reminds me of that fine American institution for censorship? The Motion Picture Association of America better known as the MPAA. "Man Bites Dog" makes sense for receiving the dreaded NC-17 rating. While the latter rating is usually reserved for sexually-themed films like SHOWGIRLS, it is finally put to proper use for a movie with such realistic depictions of violence. Forget "Blair Witch." Forget "Paranormal Activity." And forget "Quarantine." Those so-called "home video" genre movies don't hold a candle to the pure down-and-dirty celluloid that is "Man Bites Dog." The best film of 1992. Viva Cinema!

    Wow. What a disturbing film. It sure packs a wallop. It is suppose to be a black/comedy but I did not find anything amusing about it. Except for the hospital scene when our so-called hero "Ben" is bothered by the "smell" of his neighbor in the next bed who all day just, "s*^ts and sings all a day!" There are plenty of very disturbing scenes in these so-called comedy. but i could not pull myself away from watching it till the very end. It's just like the movie, Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer with Michael Rooker. This guy Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde exhibits some strange charismatic quality about him even if he is playing a most despicable character. I guess in the end I wanted too see him get his just desserts for all the pain and violent things that he did.I felt no remorse for his crew of film-boy/fan-boys that are getting killed along the way for being with this crazy, insane psycho. When they finally cross the line and become part of the madness it is just too much. they deserve what they get as far as I'm concerned. All in all it's one of those films that stays on your mind because of certain scenes. So if you are not in to this kind, stay away. Anyone else proceed at your own risk.

    I can't believe that some people consider it as a cult movie. One guy (serial killer and psychopath) very talkative, kills and destroys anything he wants to for a pleasure and tried to find out the purpose of his behavior in the front of the camera that follows him. This is very cheap movie without any sense. The main protagonist thinks he is smart and keep talking about his life while killing other people, robs their money and throws corpses over some kind of bridge while explaining the technique. In the end he got killed for causing troubles to the other gangsters. The crew that follows his crime and record it is sick and dumb too and off course got killed too. Is this kind of a movie that you wanted to see? Just sickness.

    This French film featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die was obviously not one I had heard of before until reading about it, the title certainly sounded interesting, and I was hoping it would be deserving of its placement in the book. Basically this is filmed like it is a fly on a wall documentary, as a camera crew follow serial killer and thief Ben (Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde) around as he goes about his everyday routine and life, good and bad, and with holding nothing back. Ben boasts his architectural failures, his interest in writing poetry and listening to classic music, and we see him spend time with his girlfriend, but also boasting and carrying out murders, which he sees as his craft. With the cameras capturing his activities Ben soon involves the camera crew in his escapades, and they question whether what they are filming and continuing with their film is really a good idea. When Ben murders he has no specific victims, he targets random people, most being the older generation, but also he is profoundly misogynistic, a racist xenophobe (hates foreigners) and finds postmen his favourite targets kills these types. In the end Ben finds himself the victim of crime when he finds parents and girlfriend have been murdered by someone taking revenge, and he makes his farewells on camera to the crew, but an unseen gunman kills him and the crew members one by one. Also starring R&eacute;my Belvaux as Reporter, Andr&eacute; Bonzel as Cameraman, Jacqueline Poelvoorde-Pappaert as Ben's Mother, Nelly Pappaert as Ben's Grandmother, Hector Pappaert as Ben's Grandfather, Jenny Drye as Jenny and Malou Madou as Malou. I can imagine the controversy that this film brought in its day, where it would have got complaints for sensationalising violence and murder (Natural Born Killers did a similar thing years later), but whatever people think of it, it is a bold contribution to the genre, I admit I couldn't follow it all fully, but in general it is a worthwhile satirical black comedy. Good!

    I consider it a brilliant film, but also very very disturbing. I'd sooner warn people about it than recommend it, even though it's an amazing achievement. So, for what it's worth, here's my viewing experience: I heard about this film and was immediately hooked on the absurd idea of a serial killer, on the loose, as a willing documentary subject. I also heard that it was pitch-black comedy, and a commentary on violence, society, media, etc. -- blurring the lines between observing and becoming an accomplice and whatnot. Well, in the first two acts it certainly delivers on the absurdity and the black comedy. Both Ben and the filmmakers are as matter-of-fact about his prolific killing as if it were a documentary about urban architecture, and even in the middle of his murderous acts he remains an engaging conversationalist with all sorts of attributes our culture values: extroversion, confidence, charm, a sense of humor, and fairly informed views on diverse subjects. The juxtapositions are disturbingly hilarious. He laments that African immigrants like the one he just shot don't have equal opportunities in this racist society, or that the color and layout of a certain housing project encourages violence and other social evils. He kills an entire family in their home, then reflects on the waste of human life and how there "should be a law" against that sort of thing. He explains a lot of aspects of his trade (like how to dispose of bodies and which victims are most likely to carry money), but leaves other elements in the dark. He first seems like a murderous variety of the common robber, but then plenty of killings seem to have no material motive at all, while others are clashes with rival killers (the absurdity reaches meta-levels at some points). I was shocked by the violence and I was also laughing, and I was feeling uneasy about that. Many reviews talk about how the documentary crew moves from "observers" to "accomplices", but any court of law would already consider them "accomplices" within one minute of the film starting, so that development didn't register so much to me. Sure they started taking a more active part in the carnage, but this wasn't something I considered an unexpected development. What did register to me was the shift somewhere in the third act. Suddenly I was no longer watching a dark comedy. The violence escalates to a nasty scene that I couldn't even watch, and that left me disturbed and depressed for days. It's like the movie finally decided to show me what I was looking at and say, "well, are you still laughing? Are you?" And I realized: what was there about Ben that was engaging? Even his charming ways among his friends and family were just socially acceptable methods of getting his way and remaining the center of attention, just like killing people and starring in documentaries. So among the unexpected things I found in this film was a chillingly believable portrait of a textbook sociopath. (The scary thing is that I know someone in my neighborhood who fits that profile as well.) The film is brilliant and disturbing. Proceed at your own risk.

    On the shelf of disturbing movies, Man bites dog will earn a place without even breaking a sweat. While "A Clockwork Orange" is stylized violence, this is your everyday garden variety of butchery. Filmed in a black and white documentary style, the camera crew follow Ben - part serial-killer, part hit-man, part petty thief - as he indulges in a variety of violent acts. Unlike most documentaries, however, the crew starts off as bystanders to Ben's "work" but go on to become participants leading to a twisted destructive symbiotic relationship. Ben is a killer - He kills for paid assignments, kills as a part of robbery, and sometimes even out of sheer annoyance Aside from his day job, it is simply one of his techniques of problem resolution. He does not enjoy the pain inflicted but rather has a preternatural level amorality and lack of empathy. In one of the scenes he shoots an obnoxiously loud acquaintance in the head without warning or fuss and resumes eating dinner. It is dark humor at its best; The camera timing on this particular shot is outstanding - panning between a man lying with a head shot, and the shooter consuming his meal with quick fork movements at the dinner table. Gangly and awkward at times, Ben is most easily identifiable as the lonely office worker with the uniquely European sense of (misplaced mostly) self-worth resulting in a pseudo-intellectual commentary on topics ranging from architecture to art to music. He goes about his work in a competent but non-flamboyant manner, much like an insurance auditor would. But you are acutely aware that if there was competition, he wouldn't be the best hit-man - just an average one. That he is not a meticulous serial killer is humorously evident when he finds that his body dumping ground is clearly visible from two hundred feet away with bones sticking out in every direction. Ben's only acknowledgement of society seems to be the egotistical need to ensure that the film is completed. Initially awkward in front of the camera and it's "artistic" crew, he quickly enjoys the attention. The crew perceive this weaknesses and proceed to exploit it in the opportunistic manner only the continental artsy type knows how; Even goading him on to go beyond his usual modus operandi to rob a suburban home - only to find that rich suburbans only keep credit cards at home and no cash. The film works hard at at many levels to ensure that the viewer cannot distance himself from the movie. The documentary style is only one aspect of this. Discerning viewers cannot categorize Ben with any mental illness because unlike clinical conditions that describe lack of empathy, Ben does maintain semi-functional family relationships and friendships; He also has both appreciation and moderate skills for music and sport - Piano and Boxing. Conversely, there is no opportunity to develop any sympathy for Ben either as he mercilessly smothers a ten year old boy. And that is the brilliance of the film - Adroitly manipulating the viewer's mind and shaking away any predilection to slot away Ben as an aberration. Forcing the viewer to accept Ben's existence as fact; accept society's helplessness at ever reforming or redeeming Ben; accept that for a turn of chance, they might be the next random victims of Ben. Multiple side-plots efficiently explored give a depth to the narrative that goes beyond the 95 minutes of running time. The most interesting side-plot is his relationship with the crew. The crew, through their meanness and pettiness, create a temporary sense of sympathy for Ben. It is easier to relate to the lone misfit who is cruelly unaware that he is being mocked than to the snobbish crew with their disheveled artsy attire and unwashed hippy hair. Their own baseness is evident when they are willing partners in a bout of rape facilitated by Ben and his ever present gun. While Ben is the skilled panther fending for himself, they are the hyenas of society feeding off the scraps. The situational and temporary power shifts are blindingly realistic. Eventually though, there is no conceptualization of redemption for a man like Ben. Even when his girlfriend and mother are brutally killed - his remorse comes from a selfish loss of relationship, not love. Revenge for such an act is simply a matter of professional courtesy for Ben and personal grief is only incidental. Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde is outstanding as Ben - from every drunken facial tic to the professional manner of hunting down his victims. Benoit masterfully represents Ben as a human with all the petty pride and insecurities that go with it even while indulging in demonically violent acts. A disturbingly brilliant movie - with each scene worthy of expostulation - punctuated regularly with points of high black humor, Man bites dog is an enduring cult classic.

    I consider it a brilliant film, but also very very disturbing. I'd sooner warn people about it than recommend it, even though it's an amazing achievement. So, for what it's worth, here's my viewing experience: I heard about this film and was immediately hooked on the absurd idea of a serial killer, on the loose, as a willing documentary subject. I also heard that it was pitch-black comedy, and a commentary on violence, society, media, etc. -- blurring the lines between observing and becoming an accomplice and whatnot. Well, in the first two acts it certainly delivers on the absurdity and the black comedy. Both Ben and the filmmakers are as matter-of-fact about his prolific killing as if it were a documentary about urban architecture, and even in the middle of his murderous acts he remains an engaging conversationalist with all sorts of attributes our culture values: extroversion, confidence, charm, a sense of humor, and fairly informed views on diverse subjects. The juxtapositions are disturbingly hilarious. He laments that African immigrants like the one he just shot don't have equal opportunities in this racist society, or that the color and layout of a certain housing project encourages violence and other social evils. He kills an entire family in their home, then reflects on the waste of human life and how there "should be a law" against that sort of thing. He explains a lot of aspects of his trade (like how to dispose of bodies and which victims are most likely to carry money), but leaves other elements in the dark. He first seems like a murderous variety of the common robber, but then plenty of killings seem to have no material motive at all, while others are clashes with rival killers (the absurdity reaches meta-levels at some points). I was shocked by the violence and I was also laughing, and I was feeling uneasy about that. Many reviews talk about how the documentary crew moves from "observers" to "accomplices", but any court of law would already consider them "accomplices" within one minute of the film starting, so that development didn't register so much to me. Sure they started taking a more active part in the carnage, but this wasn't something I considered an unexpected development. What did register to me was the shift somewhere in the third act. Suddenly I was no longer watching a dark comedy. The violence escalates to a nasty scene that I couldn't even watch, and that left me disturbed and depressed for days. It's like the movie finally decided to show me what I was looking at and say, "well, are you still laughing? Are you?" And I realized: what was there about Ben that was engaging? Even his charming ways among his friends and family were just socially acceptable methods of getting his way and remaining the center of attention, just like killing people and starring in documentaries. So among the unexpected things I found in this film was a chillingly believable portrait of a textbook sociopath. (The scary thing is that I know someone in my neighborhood who fits that profile as well.) The film is brilliant and disturbing. Proceed at your own risk.

    On the shelf of disturbing movies, Man bites dog will earn a place without even breaking a sweat. While "A Clockwork Orange" is stylized violence, this is your everyday garden variety of butchery. Filmed in a black and white documentary style, the camera crew follow Ben - part serial-killer, part hit-man, part petty thief - as he indulges in a variety of violent acts. Unlike most documentaries, however, the crew starts off as bystanders to Ben's "work" but go on to become participants leading to a twisted destructive symbiotic relationship. Ben is a killer - He kills for paid assignments, kills as a part of robbery, and sometimes even out of sheer annoyance Aside from his day job, it is simply one of his techniques of problem resolution. He does not enjoy the pain inflicted but rather has a preternatural level amorality and lack of empathy. In one of the scenes he shoots an obnoxiously loud acquaintance in the head without warning or fuss and resumes eating dinner. It is dark humor at its best; The camera timing on this particular shot is outstanding - panning between a man lying with a head shot, and the shooter consuming his meal with quick fork movements at the dinner table. Gangly and awkward at times, Ben is most easily identifiable as the lonely office worker with the uniquely European sense of (misplaced mostly) self-worth resulting in a pseudo-intellectual commentary on topics ranging from architecture to art to music. He goes about his work in a competent but non-flamboyant manner, much like an insurance auditor would. But you are acutely aware that if there was competition, he wouldn't be the best hit-man - just an average one. That he is not a meticulous serial killer is humorously evident when he finds that his body dumping ground is clearly visible from two hundred feet away with bones sticking out in every direction. Ben's only acknowledgement of society seems to be the egotistical need to ensure that the film is completed. Initially awkward in front of the camera and it's "artistic" crew, he quickly enjoys the attention. The crew perceive this weaknesses and proceed to exploit it in the opportunistic manner only the continental artsy type knows how; Even goading him on to go beyond his usual modus operandi to rob a suburban home - only to find that rich suburbans only keep credit cards at home and no cash. The film works hard at at many levels to ensure that the viewer cannot distance himself from the movie. The documentary style is only one aspect of this. Discerning viewers cannot categorize Ben with any mental illness because unlike clinical conditions that describe lack of empathy, Ben does maintain semi-functional family relationships and friendships; He also has both appreciation and moderate skills for music and sport - Piano and Boxing. Conversely, there is no opportunity to develop any sympathy for Ben either as he mercilessly smothers a ten year old boy. And that is the brilliance of the film - Adroitly manipulating the viewer's mind and shaking away any predilection to slot away Ben as an aberration. Forcing the viewer to accept Ben's existence as fact; accept society's helplessness at ever reforming or redeeming Ben; accept that for a turn of chance, they might be the next random victims of Ben. Multiple side-plots efficiently explored give a depth to the narrative that goes beyond the 95 minutes of running time. The most interesting side-plot is his relationship with the crew. The crew, through their meanness and pettiness, create a temporary sense of sympathy for Ben. It is easier to relate to the lone misfit who is cruelly unaware that he is being mocked than to the snobbish crew with their disheveled artsy attire and unwashed hippy hair. Their own baseness is evident when they are willing partners in a bout of rape facilitated by Ben and his ever present gun. While Ben is the skilled panther fending for himself, they are the hyenas of society feeding off the scraps. The situational and temporary power shifts are blindingly realistic. Eventually though, there is no conceptualization of redemption for a man like Ben. Even when his girlfriend and mother are brutally killed - his remorse comes from a selfish loss of relationship, not love. Revenge for such an act is simply a matter of professional courtesy for Ben and personal grief is only incidental. Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde is outstanding as Ben - from every drunken facial tic to the professional manner of hunting down his victims. Benoit masterfully represents Ben as a human with all the petty pride and insecurities that go with it even while indulging in demonically violent acts. A disturbingly brilliant movie - with each scene worthy of expostulation - punctuated regularly with points of high black humor, Man bites dog is an enduring cult classic.

    Me and my mate went to see this film in 1992 when it came out. We were 20 something nobodies in London. It was the only friend we had and I think it still is!!!! We howled all the way through. The sangfroid with which the killer dispatches his victims. The gutless bumbling of the film crew were just brilliant. The pieces to camera were great as was the black and white photography. If I could get a copy of the poster I would hang it on my wall! Perfect for 20 something nobodies and one of the best experiences I have had in the cinema.

    I just saw the movie bout ten minutes ago and the second it finished I felt dirty. The movie makes you laugh at things that you wouldn't ever think you would be able to laugh to. The characters are a weird mix of extremely likable and extremely unlikeable. The movie has two scenes which made me want to fast forward 1. The rape scene 2. The child murder scene.The only problem i have with the film is that at times it get a little two slow and to much talking and the ending was a tiny bit too sudden. Overall it was a very funny and disturbing film which I'm not sure if I could watch it again soon because of the extremely hard to watch rape scene, I gave it a 8 out of 10.

    Everybody shut up please, and listen. I am from Belgium, so I have a right to speak. Hear ye! Hear ye! No, seriously, everybody's opinion is worth as much as the next one, I'm just joking, but I want to write a few words about this movie, so people can understand it better. First of all, some people don't realise that this film was made with a budget of less than 50.000 dollar. The actors in the movie are mostly family and friends. Benoit Poelvoorde, who plays the main role, is the only professional, and he delivers a fantastic performance as the talkative, self-absorbed, hyperbolic, maniac Ben, we all come to love. It was the role of his life. The director and sound engineers had just graduated film school. They still had a lot to learn. So you have to give the makers credit for that. Knowing all this, you understand this has to be seen as a cult-movie. A cult-movie, with a great script, witty dialogues, and legendary scenes. With a great sense of irony. My favourite scenes of Man bites Dog are the chase in the abandoned factory (with the pigeon poem), and the bar scene, ending with Benoit Poelvoorde singing the cinema song, with fake beard. Most film fans in Belgium can recite whole passages upon request. The ending is a bit abrupt, and some scenes are superfluous, but the film has the streak of genius all the way through. Hope you enjoy it.

    Well I've had my fair share of disturbing films, from Martyrs to Inside (also French films) but what sets Man Bites Dog apart from other French horror is the sheer realism. I was scared that the film would just be a man going around killing people, and essentially it just is. But nevertheless it is a strangely compelling and gripping film that has a serious message about the desensitisation of violence in films. I was laughing at it at the start, but then things stop become being funny, pretty much as soon as he kills the old woman in such an unsettling manner. The killing of children is also something I found particularly shocking, but I suppose that's what made the film so compelling, the protagonist is such an unusual and highly unpredictable character. It's impossible to know what he's going to do next and some scenes really did have the power to shock. Overall, I think Man Bites Dog did suffer from a lack of narrative drive and a predictable ending, however it was still a captivating experience, and one I'm not likely to forget.

    A cerebral hybrid between "Monty Python", "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" and "American Psycho", "Man Bites Dog" is one such film that certainly lives up to its underground reputation. The film's grainy black-and-white photography sets up the overall tone as the viewer goes on a violent, blackly-humorous joyride masquerading as an actual documentary. Meet Benoit Poelvoorde, a clever, cultured, quick-witted, well-liked young man. A seemingly normal man with a fondness for mussels, running down the beach in the nude and most of all, he kills innocent people for a living. Cameraman Andre Bonzel and reporter Remy Belvaux are on hand to film the mundane activities of Ben's daily life along with his friends and family. Unfortunately, the two men begin to realize that their archetypal subject is doing more than just being Mr. Nice Guy. From losing his cherished ID bracelet to accidentally killing a birthday party goer, Ben becomes more than just your garden-variety serial killer in the movies. While viewing the film numerous times, I don't know what my natural reaction would be whether to laugh or be horrified. The final reaction would be both. Yes, the film is indeed shockingly violent, offensively funny and proud of it. But thanks to Poelvoorde's naturalistic performance, we know "Man Bites Dog" will be an out-of-this-world experience filled with manic glee and intense energy. The main saying goes: "No rules, no consequences." Which reminds me of that fine American institution for censorship? The Motion Picture Association of America better known as the MPAA. "Man Bites Dog" makes sense for receiving the dreaded NC-17 rating. While the latter rating is usually reserved for sexually-themed films like SHOWGIRLS, it is finally put to proper use for a movie with such realistic depictions of violence. Forget "Blair Witch." Forget "Paranormal Activity." And forget "Quarantine." Those so-called "home video" genre movies don't hold a candle to the pure down-and-dirty celluloid that is "Man Bites Dog." The best film of 1992. Viva Cinema!

    Wow. What a disturbing film. It sure packs a wallop. It is suppose to be a black/comedy but I did not find anything amusing about it. Except for the hospital scene when our so-called hero "Ben" is bothered by the "smell" of his neighbor in the next bed who all day just, "s*^ts and sings all a day!" There are plenty of very disturbing scenes in these so-called comedy. but i could not pull myself away from watching it till the very end. It's just like the movie, Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer with Michael Rooker. This guy Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde exhibits some strange charismatic quality about him even if he is playing a most despicable character. I guess in the end I wanted too see him get his just desserts for all the pain and violent things that he did.I felt no remorse for his crew of film-boy/fan-boys that are getting killed along the way for being with this crazy, insane psycho. When they finally cross the line and become part of the madness it is just too much. they deserve what they get as far as I'm concerned. All in all it's one of those films that stays on your mind because of certain scenes. So if you are not in to this kind, stay away. Anyone else proceed at your own risk.

    I can't believe that some people consider it as a cult movie. One guy (serial killer and psychopath) very talkative, kills and destroys anything he wants to for a pleasure and tried to find out the purpose of his behavior in the front of the camera that follows him. This is very cheap movie without any sense. The main protagonist thinks he is smart and keep talking about his life while killing other people, robs their money and throws corpses over some kind of bridge while explaining the technique. In the end he got killed for causing troubles to the other gangsters. The crew that follows his crime and record it is sick and dumb too and off course got killed too. Is this kind of a movie that you wanted to see? Just sickness.

    This French film featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die was obviously not one I had heard of before until reading about it, the title certainly sounded interesting, and I was hoping it would be deserving of its placement in the book. Basically this is filmed like it is a fly on a wall documentary, as a camera crew follow serial killer and thief Ben (Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde) around as he goes about his everyday routine and life, good and bad, and with holding nothing back. Ben boasts his architectural failures, his interest in writing poetry and listening to classic music, and we see him spend time with his girlfriend, but also boasting and carrying out murders, which he sees as his craft. With the cameras capturing his activities Ben soon involves the camera crew in his escapades, and they question whether what they are filming and continuing with their film is really a good idea. When Ben murders he has no specific victims, he targets random people, most being the older generation, but also he is profoundly misogynistic, a racist xenophobe (hates foreigners) and finds postmen his favourite targets kills these types. In the end Ben finds himself the victim of crime when he finds parents and girlfriend have been murdered by someone taking revenge, and he makes his farewells on camera to the crew, but an unseen gunman kills him and the crew members one by one. Also starring R&eacute;my Belvaux as Reporter, Andr&eacute; Bonzel as Cameraman, Jacqueline Poelvoorde-Pappaert as Ben's Mother, Nelly Pappaert as Ben's Grandmother, Hector Pappaert as Ben's Grandfather, Jenny Drye as Jenny and Malou Madou as Malou. I can imagine the controversy that this film brought in its day, where it would have got complaints for sensationalising violence and murder (Natural Born Killers did a similar thing years later), but whatever people think of it, it is a bold contribution to the genre, I admit I couldn't follow it all fully, but in general it is a worthwhile satirical black comedy. Good!

It's impossible to know what he's going to do next and some scenes really did have the power to shock. Overall, I think Man Bites Dog did suffer from a lack of narrative drive and a predictable ending, however it was still a captivating experience, and one I'm not likely to forget.

    A cerebral hybrid between "Monty Python", "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" and "American Psycho", "Man Bites Dog" is one such film that certainly lives up to its underground reputation. The film's grainy black-and-white photography sets up the overall tone as the viewer goes on a violent, blackly-humorous joyride masquerading as an actual documentary. Meet Benoit Poelvoorde, a clever, cultured, quick-witted, well-liked young man. A seemingly normal man with a fondness for mussels, running down the beach in the nude and most of all, he kills innocent people for a living. Cameraman Andre Bonzel and reporter Remy Belvaux are on hand to film the mundane activities of Ben's daily life along with his friends and family. Unfortunately, the two men begin to realize that their archetypal subject is doing more than just being Mr. Nice Guy. From losing his cherished ID bracelet to accidentally killing a birthday party goer, Ben becomes more than just your garden-variety serial killer in the movies. While viewing the film numerous times, I don't know what my natural reaction would be whether to laugh or be horrified. The final reaction would be both. Yes, the film is indeed shockingly violent, offensively funny and proud of it. But thanks to Poelvoorde's naturalistic performance, we know "Man Bites Dog" will be an out-of-this-world experience filled with manic glee and intense energy. The main saying goes: "No rules, no consequences." Which reminds me of that fine American institution for censorship? The Motion Picture Association of America better known as the MPAA. "Man Bites Dog" makes sense for receiving the dreaded NC-17 rating. While the latter rating is usually reserved for sexually-themed films like SHOWGIRLS, it is finally put to proper use for a movie with such realistic depictions of violence. Forget "Blair Witch." Forget "Paranormal Activity." And forget "Quarantine." Those so-called "home video" genre movies don't hold a candle to the pure down-and-dirty celluloid that is "Man Bites Dog." The best film of 1992. Viva Cinema!

    Wow. What a disturbing film. It sure packs a wallop. It is suppose to be a black/comedy but I did not find anything amusing about it. Except for the hospital scene when our so-called hero "Ben" is bothered by the "smell" of his neighbor in the next bed who all day just, "s*^ts and sings all a day!" There are plenty of very disturbing scenes in these so-called comedy. but i could not pull myself away from watching it till the very end. It's just like the movie, Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer with Michael Rooker. This guy Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde exhibits some strange charismatic quality about him even if he is playing a most despicable character. I guess in the end I wanted too see him get his just desserts for all the pain and violent things that he did.I felt no remorse for his crew of film-boy/fan-boys that are getting killed along the way for being with this crazy, insane psycho. When they finally cross the line and become part of the madness it is just too much. they deserve what they get as far as I'm concerned. All in all it's one of those films that stays on your mind because of certain scenes. So if you are not in to this kind, stay away. Anyone else proceed at your own risk.

    I can't believe that some people consider it as a cult movie. One guy (serial killer and psychopath) very talkative, kills and destroys anything he wants to for a pleasure and tried to find out the purpose of his behavior in the front of the camera that follows him. This is very cheap movie without any sense. The main protagonist thinks he is smart and keep talking about his life while killing other people, robs their money and throws corpses over some kind of bridge while explaining the technique. In the end he got killed for causing troubles to the other gangsters. The crew that follows his crime and record it is sick and dumb too and off course got killed too. Is this kind of a movie that you wanted to see? Just sickness.

    This French film featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die was obviously not one I had heard of before until reading about it, the title certainly sounded interesting, and I was hoping it would be deserving of its placement in the book. Basically this is filmed like it is a fly on a wall documentary, as a camera crew follow serial killer and thief Ben (Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde) around as he goes about his everyday routine and life, good and bad, and with holding nothing back. Ben boasts his architectural failures, his interest in writing poetry and listening to classic music, and we see him spend time with his girlfriend, but also boasting and carrying out murders, which he sees as his craft. With the cameras capturing his activities Ben soon involves the camera crew in his escapades, and they question whether what they are filming and continuing with their film is really a good idea. When Ben murders he has no specific victims, he targets random people, most being the older generation, but also he is profoundly misogynistic, a racist xenophobe (hates foreigners) and finds postmen his favourite targets kills these types. In the end Ben finds himself the victim of crime when he finds parents and girlfriend have been murdered by someone taking revenge, and he makes his farewells on camera to the crew, but an unseen gunman kills him and the crew members one by one. Also starring R&eacute;my Belvaux as Reporter, Andr&eacute; Bonzel as Cameraman, Jacqueline Poelvoorde-Pappaert as Ben's Mother, Nelly Pappaert as Ben's Grandmother, Hector Pappaert as Ben's Grandfather, Jenny Drye as Jenny and Malou Madou as Malou. I can imagine the controversy that this film brought in its day, where it would have got complaints for sensationalising violence and murder (Natural Born Killers did a similar thing years later), but whatever people think of it, it is a bold contribution to the genre, I admit I couldn't follow it all fully, but in general it is a worthwhile satirical black comedy. Good!

    I consider it a brilliant film, but also very very disturbing. I'd sooner warn people about it than recommend it, even though it's an amazing achievement. So, for what it's worth, here's my viewing experience: I heard about this film and was immediately hooked on the absurd idea of a serial killer, on the loose, as a willing documentary subject. I also heard that it was pitch-black comedy, and a commentary on violence, society, media, etc. -- blurring the lines between observing and becoming an accomplice and whatnot. Well, in the first two acts it certainly delivers on the absurdity and the black comedy. Both Ben and the filmmakers are as matter-of-fact about his prolific killing as if it were a documentary about urban architecture, and even in the middle of his murderous acts he remains an engaging conversationalist with all sorts of attributes our culture values: extroversion, confidence, charm, a sense of humor, and fairly informed views on diverse subjects. The juxtapositions are disturbingly hilarious. He laments that African immigrants like the one he just shot don't have equal opportunities in this racist society, or that the color and layout of a certain housing project encourages violence and other social evils. He kills an entire family in their home, then reflects on the waste of human life and how there "should be a law" against that sort of thing. He explains a lot of aspects of his trade (like how to dispose of bodies and which victims are most likely to carry money), but leaves other elements in the dark. He first seems like a murderous variety of the common robber, but then plenty of killings seem to have no material motive at all, while others are clashes with rival killers (the absurdity reaches meta-levels at some points). I was shocked by the violence and I was also laughing, and I was feeling uneasy about that. Many reviews talk about how the documentary crew moves from "observers" to "accomplices", but any court of law would already consider them "accomplices" within one minute of the film starting, so that development didn't register so much to me. Sure they started taking a more active part in the carnage, but this wasn't something I considered an unexpected development. What did register to me was the shift somewhere in the third act. Suddenly I was no longer watching a dark comedy. The violence escalates to a nasty scene that I couldn't even watch, and that left me disturbed and depressed for days. It's like the movie finally decided to show me what I was looking at and say, "well, are you still laughing? Are you?" And I realized: what was there about Ben that was engaging? Even his charming ways among his friends and family were just socially acceptable methods of getting his way and remaining the center of attention, just like killing people and starring in documentaries. So among the unexpected things I found in this film was a chillingly believable portrait of a textbook sociopath. (The scary thing is that I know someone in my neighborhood who fits that profile as well.) The film is brilliant and disturbing. Proceed at your own risk.

    On the shelf of disturbing movies, Man bites dog will earn a place without even breaking a sweat. While "A Clockwork Orange" is stylized violence, this is your everyday garden variety of butchery. Filmed in a black and white documentary style, the camera crew follow Ben - part serial-killer, part hit-man, part petty thief - as he indulges in a variety of violent acts. Unlike most documentaries, however, the crew starts off as bystanders to Ben's "work" but go on to become participants leading to a twisted destructive symbiotic relationship. Ben is a killer - He kills for paid assignments, kills as a part of robbery, and sometimes even out of sheer annoyance Aside from his day job, it is simply one of his techniques of problem resolution. He does not enjoy the pain inflicted but rather has a preternatural level amorality and lack of empathy. In one of the scenes he shoots an obnoxiously loud acquaintance in the head without warning or fuss and resumes eating dinner. It is dark humor at its best; The camera timing on this particular shot is outstanding - panning between a man lying with a head shot, and the shooter consuming his meal with quick fork movements at the dinner table. Gangly and awkward at times, Ben is most easily identifiable as the lonely office worker with the uniquely European sense of (misplaced mostly) self-worth resulting in a pseudo-intellectual commentary on topics ranging from architecture to art to music. He goes about his work in a competent but non-flamboyant manner, much like an insurance auditor would. But you are acutely aware that if there was competition, he wouldn't be the best hit-man - just an average one. That he is not a meticulous serial killer is humorously evident when he finds that his body dumping ground is clearly visible from two hundred feet away with bones sticking out in every direction. Ben's only acknowledgement of society seems to be the egotistical need to ensure that the film is completed. Initially awkward in front of the camera and it's "artistic" crew, he quickly enjoys the attention. The crew perceive this weaknesses and proceed to exploit it in the opportunistic manner only the continental artsy type knows how; Even goading him on to go beyond his usual modus operandi to rob a suburban home - only to find that rich suburbans only keep credit cards at home and no cash. The film works hard at at many levels to ensure that the viewer cannot distance himself from the movie. The documentary style is only one aspect of this. Discerning viewers cannot categorize Ben with any mental illness because unlike clinical conditions that describe lack of empathy, Ben does maintain semi-functional family relationships and friendships; He also has both appreciation and moderate skills for music and sport - Piano and Boxing. Conversely, there is no opportunity to develop any sympathy for Ben either as he mercilessly smothers a ten year old boy. And that is the brilliance of the film - Adroitly manipulating the viewer's mind and shaking away any predilection to slot away Ben as an aberration. Forcing the viewer to accept Ben's existence as fact; accept society's helplessness at ever reforming or redeeming Ben; accept that for a turn of chance, they might be the next random victims of Ben. Multiple side-plots efficiently explored give a depth to the narrative that goes beyond the 95 minutes of running time. The most interesting side-plot is his relationship with the crew. The crew, through their meanness and pettiness, create a temporary sense of sympathy for Ben. It is easier to relate to the lone misfit who is cruelly unaware that he is being mocked than to the snobbish crew with their disheveled artsy attire and unwashed hippy hair. Their own baseness is evident when they are willing partners in a bout of rape facilitated by Ben and his ever present gun. While Ben is the skilled panther fending for himself, they are the hyenas of society feeding off the scraps. The situational and temporary power shifts are blindingly realistic. Eventually though, there is no conceptualization of redemption for a man like Ben. Even when his girlfriend and mother are brutally killed - his remorse comes from a selfish loss of relationship, not love. Revenge for such an act is simply a matter of professional courtesy for Ben and personal grief is only incidental. Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde is outstanding as Ben - from every drunken facial tic to the professional manner of hunting down his victims. Benoit masterfully represents Ben as a human with all the petty pride and insecurities that go with it even while indulging in demonically violent acts. A disturbingly brilliant movie - with each scene worthy of expostulation - punctuated regularly with points of high black humor, Man bites dog is an enduring cult classic.

    Me and my mate went to see this film in 1992 when it came out. We were 20 something nobodies in London. It was the only friend we had and I think it still is!!!! We howled all the way through. The sangfroid with which the killer dispatches his victims. The gutless bumbling of the film crew were just brilliant. The pieces to camera were great as was the black and white photography. If I could get a copy of the poster I would hang it on my wall! Perfect for 20 something nobodies and one of the best experiences I have had in the cinema.

    I just saw the movie bout ten minutes ago and the second it finished I felt dirty. The movie makes you laugh at things that you wouldn't ever think you would be able to laugh to. The characters are a weird mix of extremely likable and extremely unlikeable. The movie has two scenes which made me want to fast forward 1. The rape scene 2. The child murder scene.The only problem i have with the film is that at times it get a little two slow and to much talking and the ending was a tiny bit too sudden. Overall it was a very funny and disturbing film which I'm not sure if I could watch it again soon because of the extremely hard to watch rape scene, I gave it a 8 out of 10.

    Everybody shut up please, and listen. I am from Belgium, so I have a right to speak. Hear ye! Hear ye! No, seriously, everybody's opinion is worth as much as the next one, I'm just joking, but I want to write a few words about this movie, so people can understand it better. First of all, some people don't realise that this film was made with a budget of less than 50.000 dollar. The actors in the movie are mostly family and friends. Benoit Poelvoorde, who plays the main role, is the only professional, and he delivers a fantastic performance as the talkative, self-absorbed, hyperbolic, maniac Ben, we all come to love. It was the role of his life. The director and sound engineers had just graduated film school. They still had a lot to learn. So you have to give the makers credit for that. Knowing all this, you understand this has to be seen as a cult-movie. A cult-movie, with a great script, witty dialogues, and legendary scenes. With a great sense of irony. My favourite scenes of Man bites Dog are the chase in the abandoned factory (with the pigeon poem), and the bar scene, ending with Benoit Poelvoorde singing the cinema song, with fake beard. Most film fans in Belgium can recite whole passages upon request. The ending is a bit abrupt, and some scenes are superfluous, but the film has the streak of genius all the way through. Hope you enjoy it.

    Well I've had my fair share of disturbing films, from Martyrs to Inside (also French films) but what sets Man Bites Dog apart from other French horror is the sheer realism. I was scared that the film would just be a man going around killing people, and essentially it just is. But nevertheless it is a strangely compelling and gripping film that has a serious message about the desensitisation of violence in films. I was laughing at it at the start, but then things stop become being funny, pretty much as soon as he kills the old woman in such an unsettling manner. The killing of children is also something I found particularly shocking, but I suppose that's what made the film so compelling, the protagonist is such an unusual and highly unpredictable character. It's impossible to know what he's going to do next and some scenes really did have the power to shock. Overall, I think Man Bites Dog did suffer from a lack of narrative drive and a predictable ending, however it was still a captivating experience, and one I'm not likely to forget.

Gangly and awkward at times, Ben is most easily identifiable as the lonely office worker with the uniquely European sense of (misplaced mostly) self-worth resulting in a pseudo-intellectual commentary on topics ranging from architecture to art to music. He goes about his work in a competent but non-flamboyant manner, much like an insurance auditor would. But you are acutely aware that if there was competition, he wouldn't be the best hit-man - just an average one. That he is not a meticulous serial killer is humorously evident when he finds that his body dumping ground is clearly visible from two hundred feet away with bones sticking out in every direction. Ben's only acknowledgement of society seems to be the egotistical need to ensure that the film is completed. Initially awkward in front of the camera and it's "artistic" crew, he quickly enjoys the attention. The crew perceive this weaknesses and proceed to exploit it in the opportunistic manner only the continental artsy type knows how; Even goading him on to go beyond his usual modus operandi to rob a suburban home - only to find that rich suburbans only keep credit cards at home and no cash. The film works hard at at many levels to ensure that the viewer cannot distance himself from the movie. The documentary style is only one aspect of this. Discerning viewers cannot categorize Ben with any mental illness because unlike clinical conditions that describe lack of empathy, Ben does maintain semi-functional family relationships and friendships; He also has both appreciation and moderate skills for music and sport - Piano and Boxing. Conversely, there is no opportunity to develop any sympathy for Ben either as he mercilessly smothers a ten year old boy. And that is the brilliance of the film - Adroitly manipulating the viewer's mind and shaking away any predilection to slot away Ben as an aberration. Forcing the viewer to accept Ben's existence as fact; accept society's helplessness at ever reforming or redeeming Ben; accept that for a turn of chance, they might be the next random victims of Ben. Multiple side-plots efficiently explored give a depth to the narrative that goes beyond the 95 minutes of running time. The most interesting side-plot is his relationship with the crew. The crew, through their meanness and pettiness, create a temporary sense of sympathy for Ben. It is easier to relate to the lone misfit who is cruelly unaware that he is being mocked than to the snobbish crew with their disheveled artsy attire and unwashed hippy hair. Their own baseness is evident when they are willing partners in a bout of rape facilitated by Ben and his ever present gun. While Ben is the skilled panther fending for himself, they are the hyenas of society feeding off the scraps. The situational and temporary power shifts are blindingly realistic. Eventually though, there is no conceptualization of redemption for a man like Ben. Even when his girlfriend and mother are brutally killed - his remorse comes from a selfish loss of relationship, not love. Revenge for such an act is simply a matter of professional courtesy for Ben and personal grief is only incidental. Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde is outstanding as Ben - from every drunken facial tic to the professional manner of hunting down his victims. Benoit masterfully represents Ben as a human with all the petty pride and insecurities that go with it even while indulging in demonically violent acts. A disturbingly brilliant movie - with each scene worthy of expostulation - punctuated regularly with points of high black humor, Man bites dog is an enduring cult classic.

    Me and my mate went to see this film in 1992 when it came out. We were 20 something nobodies in London. It was the only friend we had and I think it still is!!!! We howled all the way through. The sangfroid with which the killer dispatches his victims. The gutless bumbling of the film crew were just brilliant. The pieces to camera were great as was the black and white photography. If I could get a copy of the poster I would hang it on my wall! Perfect for 20 something nobodies and one of the best experiences I have had in the cinema.

    I just saw the movie bout ten minutes ago and the second it finished I felt dirty. The movie makes you laugh at things that you wouldn't ever think you would be able to laugh to. The characters are a weird mix of extremely likable and extremely unlikeable. The movie has two scenes which made me want to fast forward 1. The rape scene 2. The child murder scene.The only problem i have with the film is that at times it get a little two slow and to much talking and the ending was a tiny bit too sudden. Overall it was a very funny and disturbing film which I'm not sure if I could watch it again soon because of the extremely hard to watch rape scene, I gave it a 8 out of 10.

    Everybody shut up please, and listen. I am from Belgium, so I have a right to speak. Hear ye! Hear ye! No, seriously, everybody's opinion is worth as much as the next one, I'm just joking, but I want to write a few words about this movie, so people can understand it better. First of all, some people don't realise that this film was made with a budget of less than 50.000 dollar. The actors in the movie are mostly family and friends. Benoit Poelvoorde, who plays the main role, is the only professional, and he delivers a fantastic performance as the talkative, self-absorbed, hyperbolic, maniac Ben, we all come to love. It was the role of his life. The director and sound engineers had just graduated film school. They still had a lot to learn. So you have to give the makers credit for that. Knowing all this, you understand this has to be seen as a cult-movie. A cult-movie, with a great script, witty dialogues, and legendary scenes. With a great sense of irony. My favourite scenes of Man bites Dog are the chase in the abandoned factory (with the pigeon poem), and the bar scene, ending with Benoit Poelvoorde singing the cinema song, with fake beard. Most film fans in Belgium can recite whole passages upon request. The ending is a bit abrupt, and some scenes are superfluous, but the film has the streak of genius all the way through. Hope you enjoy it.

    Well I've had my fair share of disturbing films, from Martyrs to Inside (also French films) but what sets Man Bites Dog apart from other French horror is the sheer realism. I was scared that the film would just be a man going around killing people, and essentially it just is. But nevertheless it is a strangely compelling and gripping film that has a serious message about the desensitisation of violence in films. I was laughing at it at the start, but then things stop become being funny, pretty much as soon as he kills the old woman in such an unsettling manner. The killing of children is also something I found particularly shocking, but I suppose that's what made the film so compelling, the protagonist is such an unusual and highly unpredictable character. It's impossible to know what he's going to do next and some scenes really did have the power to shock. Overall, I think Man Bites Dog did suffer from a lack of narrative drive and a predictable ending, however it was still a captivating experience, and one I'm not likely to forget.

    A cerebral hybrid between "Monty Python", "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" and "American Psycho", "Man Bites Dog" is one such film that certainly lives up to its underground reputation. The film's grainy black-and-white photography sets up the overall tone as the viewer goes on a violent, blackly-humorous joyride masquerading as an actual documentary. Meet Benoit Poelvoorde, a clever, cultured, quick-witted, well-liked young man. A seemingly normal man with a fondness for mussels, running down the beach in the nude and most of all, he kills innocent people for a living. Cameraman Andre Bonzel and reporter Remy Belvaux are on hand to film the mundane activities of Ben's daily life along with his friends and family. Unfortunately, the two men begin to realize that their archetypal subject is doing more than just being Mr. Nice Guy. From losing his cherished ID bracelet to accidentally killing a birthday party goer, Ben becomes more than just your garden-variety serial killer in the movies. While viewing the film numerous times, I don't know what my natural reaction would be whether to laugh or be horrified. The final reaction would be both. Yes, the film is indeed shockingly violent, offensively funny and proud of it. But thanks to Poelvoorde's naturalistic performance, we know "Man Bites Dog" will be an out-of-this-world experience filled with manic glee and intense energy. The main saying goes: "No rules, no consequences." Which reminds me of that fine American institution for censorship? The Motion Picture Association of America better known as the MPAA. "Man Bites Dog" makes sense for receiving the dreaded NC-17 rating. While the latter rating is usually reserved for sexually-themed films like SHOWGIRLS, it is finally put to proper use for a movie with such realistic depictions of violence. Forget "Blair Witch." Forget "Paranormal Activity." And forget "Quarantine." Those so-called "home video" genre movies don't hold a candle to the pure down-and-dirty celluloid that is "Man Bites Dog." The best film of 1992. Viva Cinema!

    Wow. What a disturbing film. It sure packs a wallop. It is suppose to be a black/comedy but I did not find anything amusing about it. Except for the hospital scene when our so-called hero "Ben" is bothered by the "smell" of his neighbor in the next bed who all day just, "s*^ts and sings all a day!" There are plenty of very disturbing scenes in these so-called comedy. but i could not pull myself away from watching it till the very end. It's just like the movie, Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer with Michael Rooker. This guy Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde exhibits some strange charismatic quality about him even if he is playing a most despicable character. I guess in the end I wanted too see him get his just desserts for all the pain and violent things that he did.I felt no remorse for his crew of film-boy/fan-boys that are getting killed along the way for being with this crazy, insane psycho. When they finally cross the line and become part of the madness it is just too much. they deserve what they get as far as I'm concerned. All in all it's one of those films that stays on your mind because of certain scenes. So if you are not in to this kind, stay away. Anyone else proceed at your own risk.

    I can't believe that some people consider it as a cult movie. One guy (serial killer and psychopath) very talkative, kills and destroys anything he wants to for a pleasure and tried to find out the purpose of his behavior in the front of the camera that follows him. This is very cheap movie without any sense. The main protagonist thinks he is smart and keep talking about his life while killing other people, robs their money and throws corpses over some kind of bridge while explaining the technique. In the end he got killed for causing troubles to the other gangsters. The crew that follows his crime and record it is sick and dumb too and off course got killed too. Is this kind of a movie that you wanted to see? Just sickness.

    This French film featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die was obviously not one I had heard of before until reading about it, the title certainly sounded interesting, and I was hoping it would be deserving of its placement in the book. Basically this is filmed like it is a fly on a wall documentary, as a camera crew follow serial killer and thief Ben (Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde) around as he goes about his everyday routine and life, good and bad, and with holding nothing back. Ben boasts his architectural failures, his interest in writing poetry and listening to classic music, and we see him spend time with his girlfriend, but also boasting and carrying out murders, which he sees as his craft. With the cameras capturing his activities Ben soon involves the camera crew in his escapades, and they question whether what they are filming and continuing with their film is really a good idea. When Ben murders he has no specific victims, he targets random people, most being the older generation, but also he is profoundly misogynistic, a racist xenophobe (hates foreigners) and finds postmen his favourite targets kills these types. In the end Ben finds himself the victim of crime when he finds parents and girlfriend have been murdered by someone taking revenge, and he makes his farewells on camera to the crew, but an unseen gunman kills him and the crew members one by one. Also starring R&eacute;my Belvaux as Reporter, Andr&eacute; Bonzel as Cameraman, Jacqueline Poelvoorde-Pappaert as Ben's Mother, Nelly Pappaert as Ben's Grandmother, Hector Pappaert as Ben's Grandfather, Jenny Drye as Jenny and Malou Madou as Malou. I can imagine the controversy that this film brought in its day, where it would have got complaints for sensationalising violence and murder (Natural Born Killers did a similar thing years later), but whatever people think of it, it is a bold contribution to the genre, I admit I couldn't follow it all fully, but in general it is a worthwhile satirical black comedy. Good!

    I consider it a brilliant film, but also very very disturbing. I'd sooner warn people about it than recommend it, even though it's an amazing achievement. So, for what it's worth, here's my viewing experience: I heard about this film and was immediately hooked on the absurd idea of a serial killer, on the loose, as a willing documentary subject. I also heard that it was pitch-black comedy, and a commentary on violence, society, media, etc. -- blurring the lines between observing and becoming an accomplice and whatnot. Well, in the first two acts it certainly delivers on the absurdity and the black comedy. Both Ben and the filmmakers are as matter-of-fact about his prolific killing as if it were a documentary about urban architecture, and even in the middle of his murderous acts he remains an engaging conversationalist with all sorts of attributes our culture values: extroversion, confidence, charm, a sense of humor, and fairly informed views on diverse subjects. The juxtapositions are disturbingly hilarious. He laments that African immigrants like the one he just shot don't have equal opportunities in this racist society, or that the color and layout of a certain housing project encourages violence and other social evils. He kills an entire family in their home, then reflects on the waste of human life and how there "should be a law" against that sort of thing. He explains a lot of aspects of his trade (like how to dispose of bodies and which victims are most likely to carry money), but leaves other elements in the dark. He first seems like a murderous variety of the common robber, but then plenty of killings seem to have no material motive at all, while others are clashes with rival killers (the absurdity reaches meta-levels at some points). I was shocked by the violence and I was also laughing, and I was feeling uneasy about that. Many reviews talk about how the documentary crew moves from "observers" to "accomplices", but any court of law would already consider them "accomplices" within one minute of the film starting, so that development didn't register so much to me. Sure they started taking a more active part in the carnage, but this wasn't something I considered an unexpected development. What did register to me was the shift somewhere in the third act. Suddenly I was no longer watching a dark comedy. The violence escalates to a nasty scene that I couldn't even watch, and that left me disturbed and depressed for days. It's like the movie finally decided to show me what I was looking at and say, "well, are you still laughing? Are you?" And I realized: what was there about Ben that was engaging? Even his charming ways among his friends and family were just socially acceptable methods of getting his way and remaining the center of attention, just like killing people and starring in documentaries. So among the unexpected things I found in this film was a chillingly believable portrait of a textbook sociopath. (The scary thing is that I know someone in my neighborhood who fits that profile as well.) The film is brilliant and disturbing. Proceed at your own risk.

    On the shelf of disturbing movies, Man bites dog will earn a place without even breaking a sweat. While "A Clockwork Orange" is stylized violence, this is your everyday garden variety of butchery. Filmed in a black and white documentary style, the camera crew follow Ben - part serial-killer, part hit-man, part petty thief - as he indulges in a variety of violent acts. Unlike most documentaries, however, the crew starts off as bystanders to Ben's "work" but go on to become participants leading to a twisted destructive symbiotic relationship. Ben is a killer - He kills for paid assignments, kills as a part of robbery, and sometimes even out of sheer annoyance Aside from his day job, it is simply one of his techniques of problem resolution. He does not enjoy the pain inflicted but rather has a preternatural level amorality and lack of empathy. In one of the scenes he shoots an obnoxiously loud acquaintance in the head without warning or fuss and resumes eating dinner. It is dark humor at its best; The camera timing on this particular shot is outstanding - panning between a man lying with a head shot, and the shooter consuming his meal with quick fork movements at the dinner table. Gangly and awkward at times, Ben is most easily identifiable as the lonely office worker with the uniquely European sense of (misplaced mostly) self-worth resulting in a pseudo-intellectual commentary on topics ranging from architecture to art to music. He goes about his work in a competent but non-flamboyant manner, much like an insurance auditor would. But you are acutely aware that if there was competition, he wouldn't be the best hit-man - just an average one. That he is not a meticulous serial killer is humorously evident when he finds that his body dumping ground is clearly visible from two hundred feet away with bones sticking out in every direction. Ben's only acknowledgement of society seems to be the egotistical need to ensure that the film is completed. Initially awkward in front of the camera and it's "artistic" crew, he quickly enjoys the attention. The crew perceive this weaknesses and proceed to exploit it in the opportunistic manner only the continental artsy type knows how; Even goading him on to go beyond his usual modus operandi to rob a suburban home - only to find that rich suburbans only keep credit cards at home and no cash. The film works hard at at many levels to ensure that the viewer cannot distance himself from the movie. The documentary style is only one aspect of this. Discerning viewers cannot categorize Ben with any mental illness because unlike clinical conditions that describe lack of empathy, Ben does maintain semi-functional family relationships and friendships; He also has both appreciation and moderate skills for music and sport - Piano and Boxing. Conversely, there is no opportunity to develop any sympathy for Ben either as he mercilessly smothers a ten year old boy. And that is the brilliance of the film - Adroitly manipulating the viewer's mind and shaking away any predilection to slot away Ben as an aberration. Forcing the viewer to accept Ben's existence as fact; accept society's helplessness at ever reforming or redeeming Ben; accept that for a turn of chance, they might be the next random victims of Ben. Multiple side-plots efficiently explored give a depth to the narrative that goes beyond the 95 minutes of running time. The most interesting side-plot is his relationship with the crew. The crew, through their meanness and pettiness, create a temporary sense of sympathy for Ben. It is easier to relate to the lone misfit who is cruelly unaware that he is being mocked than to the snobbish crew with their disheveled artsy attire and unwashed hippy hair. Their own baseness is evident when they are willing partners in a bout of rape facilitated by Ben and his ever present gun. While Ben is the skilled panther fending for himself, they are the hyenas of society feeding off the scraps. The situational and temporary power shifts are blindingly realistic. Eventually though, there is no conceptualization of redemption for a man like Ben. Even when his girlfriend and mother are brutally killed - his remorse comes from a selfish loss of relationship, not love. Revenge for such an act is simply a matter of professional courtesy for Ben and personal grief is only incidental. Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde is outstanding as Ben - from every drunken facial tic to the professional manner of hunting down his victims. Benoit masterfully represents Ben as a human with all the petty pride and insecurities that go with it even while indulging in demonically violent acts.

    I can't believe that some people consider it as a cult movie. One guy (serial killer and psychopath) very talkative, kills and destroys anything he wants to for a pleasure and tried to find out the purpose of his behavior in the front of the camera that follows him. This is very cheap movie without any sense. The main protagonist thinks he is smart and keep talking about his life while killing other people, robs their money and throws corpses over some kind of bridge while explaining the technique. In the end he got killed for causing troubles to the other gangsters. The crew that follows his crime and record it is sick and dumb too and off course got killed too. Is this kind of a movie that you wanted to see? Just sickness.

    This French film featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die was obviously not one I had heard of before until reading about it, the title certainly sounded interesting, and I was hoping it would be deserving of its placement in the book. Basically this is filmed like it is a fly on a wall documentary, as a camera crew follow serial killer and thief Ben (Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde) around as he goes about his everyday routine and life, good and bad, and with holding nothing back. Ben boasts his architectural failures, his interest in writing poetry and listening to classic music, and we see him spend time with his girlfriend, but also boasting and carrying out murders, which he sees as his craft. With the cameras capturing his activities Ben soon involves the camera crew in his escapades, and they question whether what they are filming and continuing with their film is really a good idea. When Ben murders he has no specific victims, he targets random people, most being the older generation, but also he is profoundly misogynistic, a racist xenophobe (hates foreigners) and finds postmen his favourite targets kills these types. In the end Ben finds himself the victim of crime when he finds parents and girlfriend have been murdered by someone taking revenge, and he makes his farewells on camera to the crew, but an unseen gunman kills him and the crew members one by one. Also starring R&eacute;my Belvaux as Reporter, Andr&eacute; Bonzel as Cameraman, Jacqueline Poelvoorde-Pappaert as Ben's Mother, Nelly Pappaert as Ben's Grandmother, Hector Pappaert as Ben's Grandfather, Jenny Drye as Jenny and Malou Madou as Malou. I can imagine the controversy that this film brought in its day, where it would have got complaints for sensationalising violence and murder (Natural Born Killers did a similar thing years later), but whatever people think of it, it is a bold contribution to the genre, I admit I couldn't follow it all fully, but in general it is a worthwhile satirical black comedy. Good!

    I consider it a brilliant film, but also very very disturbing. I'd sooner warn people about it than recommend it, even though it's an amazing achievement. So, for what it's worth, here's my viewing experience: I heard about this film and was immediately hooked on the absurd idea of a serial killer, on the loose, as a willing documentary subject. I also heard that it was pitch-black comedy, and a commentary on violence, society, media, etc. -- blurring the lines between observing and becoming an accomplice and whatnot. Well, in the first two acts it certainly delivers on the absurdity and the black comedy. Both Ben and the filmmakers are as matter-of-fact about his prolific killing as if it were a documentary about urban architecture, and even in the middle of his murderous acts he remains an engaging conversationalist with all sorts of attributes our culture values: extroversion, confidence, charm, a sense of humor, and fairly informed views on diverse subjects. The juxtapositions are disturbingly hilarious. He laments that African immigrants like the one he just shot don't have equal opportunities in this racist society, or that the color and layout of a certain housing project encourages violence and other social evils. He kills an entire family in their home, then reflects on the waste of human life and how there "should be a law" against that sort of thing. He explains a lot of aspects of his trade (like how to dispose of bodies and which victims are most likely to carry money), but leaves other elements in the dark. He first seems like a murderous variety of the common robber, but then plenty of killings seem to have no material motive at all, while others are clashes with rival killers (the absurdity reaches meta-levels at some points). I was shocked by the violence and I was also laughing, and I was feeling uneasy about that. Many reviews talk about how the documentary crew moves from "observers" to "accomplices", but any court of law would already consider them "accomplices" within one minute of the film starting, so that development didn't register so much to me. Sure they started taking a more active part in the carnage, but this wasn't something I considered an unexpected development. What did register to me was the shift somewhere in the third act. Suddenly I was no longer watching a dark comedy. The violence escalates to a nasty scene that I couldn't even watch, and that left me disturbed and depressed for days. It's like the movie finally decided to show me what I was looking at and say, "well, are you still laughing? Are you?" And I realized: what was there about Ben that was engaging? Even his charming ways among his friends and family were just socially acceptable methods of getting his way and remaining the center of attention, just like killing people and starring in documentaries. So among the unexpected things I found in this film was a chillingly believable portrait of a textbook sociopath. (The scary thing is that I know someone in my neighborhood who fits that profile as well.) The film is brilliant and disturbing. Proceed at your own risk.

    On the shelf of disturbing movies, Man bites dog will earn a place without even breaking a sweat. While "A Clockwork Orange" is stylized violence, this is your everyday garden variety of butchery. Filmed in a black and white documentary style, the camera crew follow Ben - part serial-killer, part hit-man, part petty thief - as he indulges in a variety of violent acts. Unlike most documentaries, however, the crew starts off as bystanders to Ben's "work" but go on to become participants leading to a twisted destructive symbiotic relationship. Ben is a killer - He kills for paid assignments, kills as a part of robbery, and sometimes even out of sheer annoyance Aside from his day job, it is simply one of his techniques of problem resolution. He does not enjoy the pain inflicted but rather has a preternatural level amorality and lack of empathy. In one of the scenes he shoots an obnoxiously loud acquaintance in the head without warning or fuss and resumes eating dinner. It is dark humor at its best; The camera timing on this particular shot is outstanding - panning between a man lying with a head shot, and the shooter consuming his meal with quick fork movements at the dinner table. Gangly and awkward at times, Ben is most easily identifiable as the lonely office worker with the uniquely European sense of (misplaced mostly) self-worth resulting in a pseudo-intellectual commentary on topics ranging from architecture to art to music. He goes about his work in a competent but non-flamboyant manner, much like an insurance auditor would. But you are acutely aware that if there was competition, he wouldn't be the best hit-man - just an average one. That he is not a meticulous serial killer is humorously evident when he finds that his body dumping ground is clearly visible from two hundred feet away with bones sticking out in every direction. Ben's only acknowledgement of society seems to be the egotistical need to ensure that the film is completed. Initially awkward in front of the camera and it's "artistic" crew, he quickly enjoys the attention. The crew perceive this weaknesses and proceed to exploit it in the opportunistic manner only the continental artsy type knows how; Even goading him on to go beyond his usual modus operandi to rob a suburban home - only to find that rich suburbans only keep credit cards at home and no cash. The film works hard at at many levels to ensure that the viewer cannot distance himself from the movie. The documentary style is only one aspect of this. Discerning viewers cannot categorize Ben with any mental illness because unlike clinical conditions that describe lack of empathy, Ben does maintain semi-functional family relationships and friendships; He also has both appreciation and moderate skills for music and sport - Piano and Boxing. Conversely, there is no opportunity to develop any sympathy for Ben either as he mercilessly smothers a ten year old boy. And that is the brilliance of the film - Adroitly manipulating the viewer's mind and shaking away any predilection to slot away Ben as an aberration. Forcing the viewer to accept Ben's existence as fact; accept society's helplessness at ever reforming or redeeming Ben; accept that for a turn of chance, they might be the next random victims of Ben. Multiple side-plots efficiently explored give a depth to the narrative that goes beyond the 95 minutes of running time. The most interesting side-plot is his relationship with the crew. The crew, through their meanness and pettiness, create a temporary sense of sympathy for Ben. It is easier to relate to the lone misfit who is cruelly unaware that he is being mocked than to the snobbish crew with their disheveled artsy attire and unwashed hippy hair. Their own baseness is evident when they are willing partners in a bout of rape facilitated by Ben and his ever present gun. While Ben is the skilled panther fending for himself, they are the hyenas of society feeding off the scraps. The situational and temporary power shifts are blindingly realistic. Eventually though, there is no conceptualization of redemption for a man like Ben. Even when his girlfriend and mother are brutally killed - his remorse comes from a selfish loss of relationship, not love. Revenge for such an act is simply a matter of professional courtesy for Ben and personal grief is only incidental. Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde is outstanding as Ben - from every drunken facial tic to the professional manner of hunting down his victims. Benoit masterfully represents Ben as a human with all the petty pride and insecurities that go with it even while indulging in demonically violent acts. A disturbingly brilliant movie - with each scene worthy of expostulation - punctuated regularly with points of high black humor, Man bites dog is an enduring cult classic.

    Me and my mate went to see this film in 1992 when it came out. We were 20 something nobodies in London. It was the only friend we had and I think it still is!!!! We howled all the way through. The sangfroid with which the killer dispatches his victims. The gutless bumbling of the film crew were just brilliant. The pieces to camera were great as was the black and white photography. If I could get a copy of the poster I would hang it on my wall! Perfect for 20 something nobodies and one of the best experiences I have had in the cinema.

    I just saw the movie bout ten minutes ago and the second it finished I felt dirty. The movie makes you laugh at things that you wouldn't ever think you would be able to laugh to. The characters are a weird mix of extremely likable and extremely unlikeable. The movie has two scenes which made me want to fast forward 1. The rape scene 2. The child murder scene.The only problem i have with the film is that at times it get a little two slow and to much talking and the ending was a tiny bit too sudden. Overall it was a very funny and disturbing film which I'm not sure if I could watch it again soon because of the extremely hard to watch rape scene, I gave it a 8 out of 10.

    Everybody shut up please, and listen. I am from Belgium, so I have a right to speak. Hear ye! Hear ye! No, seriously, everybody's opinion is worth as much as the next one, I'm just joking, but I want to write a few words about this movie, so people can understand it better. First of all, some people don't realise that this film was made with a budget of less than 50.000 dollar. The actors in the movie are mostly family and friends. Benoit Poelvoorde, who plays the main role, is the only professional, and he delivers a fantastic performance as the talkative, self-absorbed, hyperbolic, maniac Ben, we all come to love. It was the role of his life. The director and sound engineers had just graduated film school. They still had a lot to learn. So you have to give the makers credit for that. Knowing all this, you understand this has to be seen as a cult-movie. A cult-movie, with a great script, witty dialogues, and legendary scenes. With a great sense of irony. My favourite scenes of Man bites Dog are the chase in the abandoned factory (with the pigeon poem), and the bar scene, ending with Benoit Poelvoorde singing the cinema song, with fake beard. Most film fans in Belgium can recite whole passages upon request. The ending is a bit abrupt, and some scenes are superfluous, but the film has the streak of genius all the way through. Hope you enjoy it.

    Well I've had my fair share of disturbing films, from Martyrs to Inside (also French films) but what sets Man Bites Dog apart from other French horror is the sheer realism. I was scared that the film would just be a man going around killing people, and essentially it just is. But nevertheless it is a strangely compelling and gripping film that has a serious message about the desensitisation of violence in films. I was laughing at it at the start, but then things stop become being funny, pretty much as soon as he kills the old woman in such an unsettling manner. The killing of children is also something I found particularly shocking, but I suppose that's what made the film so compelling, the protagonist is such an unusual and highly unpredictable character. It's impossible to know what he's going to do next and some scenes really did have the power to shock. Overall, I think Man Bites Dog did suffer from a lack of narrative drive and a predictable ending, however it was still a captivating experience, and one I'm not likely to forget.

    A cerebral hybrid between "Monty Python", "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" and "American Psycho", "Man Bites Dog" is one such film that certainly lives up to its underground reputation. The film's grainy black-and-white photography sets up the overall tone as the viewer goes on a violent, blackly-humorous joyride masquerading as an actual documentary. Meet Benoit Poelvoorde, a clever, cultured, quick-witted, well-liked young man. A seemingly normal man with a fondness for mussels, running down the beach in the nude and most of all, he kills innocent people for a living. Cameraman Andre Bonzel and reporter Remy Belvaux are on hand to film the mundane activities of Ben's daily life along with his friends and family. Unfortunately, the two men begin to realize that their archetypal subject is doing more than just being Mr. Nice Guy. From losing his cherished ID bracelet to accidentally killing a birthday party goer, Ben becomes more than just your garden-variety serial killer in the movies. While viewing the film numerous times, I don't know what my natural reaction would be whether to laugh or be horrified. The final reaction would be both. Yes, the film is indeed shockingly violent, offensively funny and proud of it. But thanks to Poelvoorde's naturalistic performance, we know "Man Bites Dog" will be an out-of-this-world experience filled with manic glee and intense energy. The main saying goes: "No rules, no consequences." Which reminds me of that fine American institution for censorship? The Motion Picture Association of America better known as the MPAA. "Man Bites Dog" makes sense for receiving the dreaded NC-17 rating. While the latter rating is usually reserved for sexually-themed films like SHOWGIRLS, it is finally put to proper use for a movie with such realistic depictions of violence. Forget "Blair Witch." Forget "Paranormal Activity." And forget "Quarantine." Those so-called "home video" genre movies don't hold a candle to the pure down-and-dirty celluloid that is "Man Bites Dog." The best film of 1992. Viva Cinema!

    Wow. What a disturbing film. It sure packs a wallop. It is suppose to be a black/comedy but I did not find anything amusing about it. Except for the hospital scene when our so-called hero "Ben" is bothered by the "smell" of his neighbor in the next bed who all day just, "s*^ts and sings all a day!" There are plenty of very disturbing scenes in these so-called comedy. but i could not pull myself away from watching it till the very end. It's just like the movie, Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer with Michael Rooker. This guy Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde exhibits some strange charismatic quality about him even if he is playing a most despicable character. I guess in the end I wanted too see him get his just desserts for all the pain and violent things that he did.I felt no remorse for his crew of film-boy/fan-boys that are getting killed along the way for being with this crazy, insane psycho. When they finally cross the line and become part of the madness it is just too much. they deserve what they get as far as I'm concerned. All in all it's one of those films that stays on your mind because of certain scenes. So if you are not in to this kind, stay away. Anyone else proceed at your own risk.

The characters are a weird mix of extremely likable and extremely unlikeable. The movie has two scenes which made me want to fast forward 1. The rape scene 2. The child murder scene.The only problem i have with the film is that at times it get a little two slow and to much talking and the ending was a tiny bit too sudden. Overall it was a very funny and disturbing film which I'm not sure if I could watch it again soon because of the extremely hard to watch rape scene, I gave it a 8 out of 10.

    Everybody shut up please, and listen. I am from Belgium, so I have a right to speak. Hear ye! Hear ye! No, seriously, everybody's opinion is worth as much as the next one, I'm just joking, but I want to write a few words about this movie, so people can understand it better. First of all, some people don't realise that this film was made with a budget of less than 50.000 dollar. The actors in the movie are mostly family and friends. Benoit Poelvoorde, who plays the main role, is the only professional, and he delivers a fantastic performance as the talkative, self-absorbed, hyperbolic, maniac Ben, we all come to love. It was the role of his life. The director and sound engineers had just graduated film school. They still had a lot to learn. So you have to give the makers credit for that. Knowing all this, you understand this has to be seen as a cult-movie. A cult-movie, with a great script, witty dialogues, and legendary scenes. With a great sense of irony. My favourite scenes of Man bites Dog are the chase in the abandoned factory (with the pigeon poem), and the bar scene, ending with Benoit Poelvoorde singing the cinema song, with fake beard. Most film fans in Belgium can recite whole passages upon request. The ending is a bit abrupt, and some scenes are superfluous, but the film has the streak of genius all the way through. Hope you enjoy it.

    Well I've had my fair share of disturbing films, from Martyrs to Inside (also French films) but what sets Man Bites Dog apart from other French horror is the sheer realism. I was scared that the film would just be a man going around killing people, and essentially it just is. But nevertheless it is a strangely compelling and gripping film that has a serious message about the desensitisation of violence in films. I was laughing at it at the start, but then things stop become being funny, pretty much as soon as he kills the old woman in such an unsettling manner. The killing of children is also something I found particularly shocking, but I suppose that's what made the film so compelling, the protagonist is such an unusual and highly unpredictable character. It's impossible to know what he's going to do next and some scenes really did have the power to shock. Overall, I think Man Bites Dog did suffer from a lack of narrative drive and a predictable ending, however it was still a captivating experience, and one I'm not likely to forget.

    A cerebral hybrid between "Monty Python", "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" and "American Psycho", "Man Bites Dog" is one such film that certainly lives up to its underground reputation. The film's grainy black-and-white photography sets up the overall tone as the viewer goes on a violent, blackly-humorous joyride masquerading as an actual documentary. Meet Benoit Poelvoorde, a clever, cultured, quick-witted, well-liked young man. A seemingly normal man with a fondness for mussels, running down the beach in the nude and most of all, he kills innocent people for a living. Cameraman Andre Bonzel and reporter Remy Belvaux are on hand to film the mundane activities of Ben's daily life along with his friends and family. Unfortunately, the two men begin to realize that their archetypal subject is doing more than just being Mr. Nice Guy. From losing his cherished ID bracelet to accidentally killing a birthday party goer, Ben becomes more than just your garden-variety serial killer in the movies. While viewing the film numerous times, I don't know what my natural reaction would be whether to laugh or be horrified. The final reaction would be both. Yes, the film is indeed shockingly violent, offensively funny and proud of it. But thanks to Poelvoorde's naturalistic performance, we know "Man Bites Dog" will be an out-of-this-world experience filled with manic glee and intense energy. The main saying goes: "No rules, no consequences." Which reminds me of that fine American institution for censorship? The Motion Picture Association of America better known as the MPAA. "Man Bites Dog" makes sense for receiving the dreaded NC-17 rating. While the latter rating is usually reserved for sexually-themed films like SHOWGIRLS, it is finally put to proper use for a movie with such realistic depictions of violence. Forget "Blair Witch." Forget "Paranormal Activity." And forget "Quarantine." Those so-called "home video" genre movies don't hold a candle to the pure down-and-dirty celluloid that is "Man Bites Dog." The best film of 1992. Viva Cinema!

    Wow. What a disturbing film. It sure packs a wallop. It is suppose to be a black/comedy but I did not find anything amusing about it. Except for the hospital scene when our so-called hero "Ben" is bothered by the "smell" of his neighbor in the next bed who all day just, "s*^ts and sings all a day!" There are plenty of very disturbing scenes in these so-called comedy. but i could not pull myself away from watching it till the very end. It's just like the movie, Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer with Michael Rooker. This guy Beno&icirc;t Poelvoorde exhibits some strange charismatic quality about him even if he is playing a most despicable character. I guess in the end I wanted too see him get his just desserts for all the pain and violent things that he did.I felt no remorse for his crew of film-boy/fan-boys that are getting killed along the way for being with this crazy, insane psycho. When they finally cross the line and become part of the madness it is just too much. they deserve what they get as far as I'm concerned. All in all it's one of those films that stays on your mind because of certain scenes. So if you are not in to this kind, stay away. Anyone else proceed at your own risk.

    I can't believe that some people consider it as a cult movie. One guy (serial killer and psychopath) very talkative, kills and destroys anything he wants to for a pleasure and tried to find out the purpose of his behavior in the front of the camera that follows him. This is very cheap movie without any sense. The main protagonist thinks he is smart and keep talking about his life while killing other people, robs their money and throws corpses over some kind of bridge while explaining the technique. In the end he got killed for causing troubles to the other gangsters. The crew that follows his crime and record it is sick and dumb too and off course got killed too. Is this kind of a movie that you wanted to see? Just sickness.
