    In typical Hollywood fashion, "Braveheart" delivers a sturdy tagline as a sort of moral: "Every man dies, but not every man really lives." That is particularly true of Mel Gibson movies, where you can be assured that nearly everyone will die in very bloody and gruesome Medieval fashion, and that most of them won't be given the chance to really live. (Although the film's portrayal of 13th-century Scotland looks so miserable, I can't fathom why any of them would bother.) But what about Mel? History dictates that Mel, as the eponymous -- sort of -- hero, will have to really die. But does he really live? Let's see what Mel and his screenwriter, Randall Wallace, offer as a definition of "really living": 1. William Wallace's wife is murdered the day after their wedding. 2. Wallace's rampage of revenge incites a bloody insurrection. 3. A pitched battle is fought, leading to hundreds of dead Englishmen and horses and hundreds of exposed Scottish backsides. 4. Wallace has a clandestine affair with the French princess -- who, according to history, was nine years old, but never mind. 5. Wallace is betrayed, captured, and messily tortured and executed in an extended climax that reaches a sort of feverish apotheosis with Mel screaming "FREEEEDOM" with blood and spittle flying from his lips. Gosh. If that's what they think "really living" is all about, I've got a long way to go. Messrs. Gibson and Wallace (Randall, not William...) have settled on a rather ruthless and violent idea of what life is all about, and their concept of "freedom" seems equally brutal. Revenge, philandering, pedophilia, gory disembowelings -- is that sort of freedom really worth it?

    It's only Mel's second time at the helm, and he goes and knocks this baby outta the park. I'm no Scot, but Gibson convinced me he was. And I dare say he (and the terrific script) make William Wallace one of the cinematic greats. Longshanks is a grade-A son-of-a-bitch, played with sinister glee by Patrick McGoohan. Even Sophie Marceau holds her own here. Everything about "Braveheart" is incredibly well-done; the righteous battle scenes (thoroughly gripping and just violent enough), the cinematography, the writing, directing, acting ... all of it. It even features possibly the most heartbreaking torture scene I've ever seen. And all of this is set to a supremely heartfelt and rousing score. And despite its 3-hour running time, "Braveheart" is never boring. My only regret is waiting almost twenty years to finally see it. 9/10

    Mel Gibson's "Braveheart" is a full-throated, red-blooded battle epic about William Wallace, the legendary Scots warrior who led his nation into battle against the English in the years around 1300. It's an ambitious film, big on simple emotions like love, patriotism and treachery, and avoids the travelogue style of so many historical swashbucklers: Its locations look green, wet, vast, muddy and rugged. Not much is known about Wallace, known as Braveheart, except that according to an old epic poem, he unified the clans of Scotland and won famous battles against the English before being captured, tortured and executed as a traitor. Wallace's dying cry, as his body was stretched on the rack, was "freedom!" That isn't exactly based on fact (the concept of personal freedom was a concept not much celebrated in 1300), but it doesn't stop Gibson from making it his dying cry. It fits in with the whole glorious sweep of "Braveheart," which is an action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of "The Road Warrior." What people are going to remember from the film are the battle scenes, which are frequent, bloody and violent. Just from a technical point of view, "Braveheart" does a brilliant job of massing men and horses for large-scale warfare on film. Gibson deploys what look like thousands of men on horseback, as well as foot soldiers, archers and dirty tricks specialists, and yet his battle sequences don't turn into confusing crowd scenes: We understand the strategy, and we enjoy the tactics even while we're doubting some of them (did 14th century Scots really set battlefields aflame?). Gibson is not filming history here, but myth. William Wallace may have been a real person, but "Braveheart" owes more to Prince Valiant, Rob Roy and Mad Max. Once we understand that this is not a solemn historical reconstruction (and that happens pretty fast), we accept dialogue that might otherwise have an uncannily modern tone, as when Braveheart issues his victory ultimatum to the English: "Scotland's terms are that your commander present himself in front of our army, put his head between his legs and kiss his - - -." Uh, huh. In the film, Wallace's chief antagonist is King Edward I ("Longshanks"), played by Patrick McGoohan with sly cunning; he is constantly giving his realpolitik interpretation of events, and that's all the more amusing since he's usually guessing wrong. Edward's son, the Prince of Wales (Peter Hanly), is an effete fop who marries a French woman only for political reasons. "I may have to conceive the child myself!" Longshanks says, and indeed, under the medieval concept of prima nocte, or "first night," nobles were allowed a first chance to sleep with the wives of their lessers. The Princess, played by the French actress Sophie Marceau, does not much admire her husband, who spends most of his time hanging about moon-eyed with his best friend (until the king, in a fit of impatience, hurls the friend out the castle window). Edward, smarting from defeats, dispatches the Princess to offer his terms to Braveheart, but soon she's spilling all the state secrets, "because of the way you look at me." The Princess is the second love in Wallace's life; the first, his childhood sweetheart Murron (Catherine McCormack), marries him in secret (so the local English lord won't claim his rights). The two spend their wedding night outdoors, and the backlit shot as they embrace gains something, I think, from the frost on their breaths. These characters come from hardened stock. (When Wallace has a reunion with his childhood pal Hamish, they hurl rocks at each other for entertainment; later, when a Scotsman has his wound cauterized, all he says is, "That'll wake you up in the morning, boy!") It is sometimes seen as an egotistical gesture when actors direct themselves, especially in heroic epics costing (so they say) $53 million. The truth is, given this material, I do not know that anyone could have directed it better. Gibson marshals his armies of extras, his stunt men and his special effects, and creates a fictional world that is entertaining, and thrilling. And as Braveheart, Gibson plays his role with flamboyance, and cuts it with sly humor. He is an amazing battlefield strategist, inventing new strategies and weapons, outsmarting the English at every turn, leading his men into battle with his face painted blue, like a football fan. There is a scene where he is so pumped up with the scent of battle that his nostrils flare; not many actors could get away with that, but Gibson can.

    Braveheart is actually one of my favorite movies i've seen so far. It's story about one man giving his life for his country, for his people. His name is William Wallace, Scotish hero who fought for his country. Storyline is, in my opinion, amazing. It show us that some stuff are worth of our life, like safeness of our people, our nation, our kids, our family, that's main point of this movie. It also show us that sometimes even our own brothers can betray us. Freedom is something worth of fighting, something that takes a life. To reach it you gonna take all risk you gonna meet. Also movie full of good quotes...

    So many reviews have been written about this film during the last two decades so I won't be extensive. Simply THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE! I always knew this from the beginning... My opinion has never changed since back in 1995 when I first watched it, I've seen it many many time and never been tired of it. This movie works on so many levels (Plot, script, cast, action sequences) but the main one is the acting of Mel Gibson because HE IS DIRECTING HIMSELF. He knew exactly was he was doing. BRAVISSIMO. Mel's best recitation ( his second is "The Man Without a Face"). Masterpiece. Excellent. Another great element is the score by James Horner without any doubt his best score ever (his second best is Legend of the falls, then Avatar) and Mel manages to match it perfectly with his images. A PERFECT MOVIE. MAGISTRALMENTE executed!!!

    I was excited to see this movie. It won 5 Oscars, it has supposedly great acting, and is apparently very exciting and inspiring to many of the people who have seen it. However, I tried to watch this movie and was so repelled by Mel Gibson's flat, bland, pathetic performance and the pretentious and simplistic plot that I could not finish it. Mel Gibson is absolutely terrible in this film. His character is completely one-dimensional and his romance is absolutely unbelievable. He looks completely ridiculous with 3 foot long hair and he is very conspicuously miscast. The camera lingers on his epic feats and heroic poses and I wondered sometimes if the movie was more a Mel Gibson montage or a biopic (which it really isn't anyway). From what I have heard, this movie completely butchered history. It is known to be one of the most inaccurate biopics ever created. And if this is true, then how on earth can it be "inspiring," "breathtaking," even good?! This is truly an insult to cinema and history. 1/10

    Provoked into resistance by the savage murder of his wife, William Wallace leads the Scots in a fight for independence from English oppression. Braveheart, Mel Gibson's finest hour, deserves its Oscars - it is a fine film, epic in scale, well acted, brilliantly directed, full of iconic sequences and moments. On the downside, it is violent, and Gibson's favourite dislike after the Jews, the English, are monsterised as subtext (see also The Patriot). This does not diminish Braveheart as a film, it just adds to one's knowledge. It doesn't help me like Gibson, although it gives me great cause to admire him as an actor and director.

    This film is a racist, sexist, homophobic piece of Nazi propaganda by the anti-semitic bipolar alcoholic Mel Gibson. It is absolutely disgusting that the film could pretend that King Edward II was some kind of effeminate homosexual when in actual fact he was a tall, bearded, physically strong warrior just like his father. Edward II fathered at least five children by several different women, and he died of old age in exile. Mel Gibson is a Nazi and this film is just a made up, historically worthless, fictional piece of crap. Gibson was far too old to play Wallace and his "Scottish" accent was as bad as his awful ginger wig. Patrick McGoohan gives a stupid one-note performance as Edward I. Also Robert the Bruce (the real "Braveheart") never betrayed Wallace, the Battle of Stirling Bridge should have been filmed at a, er, bridge, and the "evil" English only invaded Scotland after the Scots had allied with France and Norway in a war against the English. 0/10. PS: I hope any Americans watching this made up tripe are aware that over 90% of people in England strongly support Scottish "independence", and that if a referendum on Scotland's "independence" (in the EU!!!) was held south of the border then Scotland would be long gone.

    Braveheart is an absolute fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline that contains both a lot of action and a lot of heart,with very strong,powerful and inspired performances.Even for people who aren't from Scotland,this movie gives you great pride from the country you came from,it is all beautifully made and William Wallace is without a doubt Mel Gibson's finest performance,and his most impressive movie as a director.I also loved Brendan Gleeson in this movie,he isn't a very important character,but he is such a good actor and gave me so much pride for the country I come from,Ireland.Braveheart is a highly recommend movie for all moviegoers,those five Academy Awards don't lie. After his wife is sentenced to death by an English soldier,William Wallace leads a group of Scottish warriors to battle against the English for their countries freedom.

    This film is a racist, sexist, homophobic piece of Nazi propaganda by the anti-semitic bipolar alcoholic Mel Gibson. It is absolutely disgusting that the film could pretend that King Edward II was some kind of effeminate homosexual when in actual fact he was a tall, bearded, physically strong warrior just like his father. Edward II fathered at least five children by several different women, and he died of old age in exile. Mel Gibson is a Nazi and this film is just a made up, historically worthless, fictional piece of crap. Gibson was far too old to play Wallace and his "Scottish" accent was as bad as his awful ginger wig. Patrick McGoohan gives a stupid one-note performance as Edward I. Also Robert the Bruce (the real "Braveheart") never betrayed Wallace, the Battle of Stirling Bridge should have been filmed at a, er, bridge, and the "evil" English only invaded Scotland after the Scots had allied with France and Norway in a war against the English. 0/10. PS: I hope any Americans watching this made up tripe are aware that over 90% of people in England strongly support Scottish "independence", and that if a referendum on Scotland's "independence" (in the EU!!!) was held south of the border then Scotland would be long gone.

    Braveheart is an absolute fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline that contains both a lot of action and a lot of heart,with very strong,powerful and inspired performances.Even for people who aren't from Scotland,this movie gives you great pride from the country you came from,it is all beautifully made and William Wallace is without a doubt Mel Gibson's finest performance,and his most impressive movie as a director.I also loved Brendan Gleeson in this movie,he isn't a very important character,but he is such a good actor and gave me so much pride for the country I come from,Ireland.Braveheart is a highly recommend movie for all moviegoers,those five Academy Awards don't lie. After his wife is sentenced to death by an English soldier,William Wallace leads a group of Scottish warriors to battle against the English for their countries freedom.

    In typical Hollywood fashion, "Braveheart" delivers a sturdy tagline as a sort of moral: "Every man dies, but not every man really lives." That is particularly true of Mel Gibson movies, where you can be assured that nearly everyone will die in very bloody and gruesome Medieval fashion, and that most of them won't be given the chance to really live. (Although the film's portrayal of 13th-century Scotland looks so miserable, I can't fathom why any of them would bother.) But what about Mel? History dictates that Mel, as the eponymous -- sort of -- hero, will have to really die. But does he really live? Let's see what Mel and his screenwriter, Randall Wallace, offer as a definition of "really living": 1. William Wallace's wife is murdered the day after their wedding. 2. Wallace's rampage of revenge incites a bloody insurrection. 3. A pitched battle is fought, leading to hundreds of dead Englishmen and horses and hundreds of exposed Scottish backsides. 4. Wallace has a clandestine affair with the French princess -- who, according to history, was nine years old, but never mind. 5. Wallace is betrayed, captured, and messily tortured and executed in an extended climax that reaches a sort of feverish apotheosis with Mel screaming "FREEEEDOM" with blood and spittle flying from his lips. Gosh. If that's what they think "really living" is all about, I've got a long way to go. Messrs. Gibson and Wallace (Randall, not William...) have settled on a rather ruthless and violent idea of what life is all about, and their concept of "freedom" seems equally brutal. Revenge, philandering, pedophilia, gory disembowelings -- is that sort of freedom really worth it?

    It's only Mel's second time at the helm, and he goes and knocks this baby outta the park. I'm no Scot, but Gibson convinced me he was. And I dare say he (and the terrific script) make William Wallace one of the cinematic greats. Longshanks is a grade-A son-of-a-bitch, played with sinister glee by Patrick McGoohan. Even Sophie Marceau holds her own here. Everything about "Braveheart" is incredibly well-done; the righteous battle scenes (thoroughly gripping and just violent enough), the cinematography, the writing, directing, acting ... all of it. It even features possibly the most heartbreaking torture scene I've ever seen. And all of this is set to a supremely heartfelt and rousing score. And despite its 3-hour running time, "Braveheart" is never boring. My only regret is waiting almost twenty years to finally see it. 9/10

    Mel Gibson's "Braveheart" is a full-throated, red-blooded battle epic about William Wallace, the legendary Scots warrior who led his nation into battle against the English in the years around 1300. It's an ambitious film, big on simple emotions like love, patriotism and treachery, and avoids the travelogue style of so many historical swashbucklers: Its locations look green, wet, vast, muddy and rugged. Not much is known about Wallace, known as Braveheart, except that according to an old epic poem, he unified the clans of Scotland and won famous battles against the English before being captured, tortured and executed as a traitor. Wallace's dying cry, as his body was stretched on the rack, was "freedom!" That isn't exactly based on fact (the concept of personal freedom was a concept not much celebrated in 1300), but it doesn't stop Gibson from making it his dying cry. It fits in with the whole glorious sweep of "Braveheart," which is an action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of "The Road Warrior." What people are going to remember from the film are the battle scenes, which are frequent, bloody and violent. Just from a technical point of view, "Braveheart" does a brilliant job of massing men and horses for large-scale warfare on film. Gibson deploys what look like thousands of men on horseback, as well as foot soldiers, archers and dirty tricks specialists, and yet his battle sequences don't turn into confusing crowd scenes: We understand the strategy, and we enjoy the tactics even while we're doubting some of them (did 14th century Scots really set battlefields aflame?). Gibson is not filming history here, but myth. William Wallace may have been a real person, but "Braveheart" owes more to Prince Valiant, Rob Roy and Mad Max. Once we understand that this is not a solemn historical reconstruction (and that happens pretty fast), we accept dialogue that might otherwise have an uncannily modern tone, as when Braveheart issues his victory ultimatum to the English: "Scotland's terms are that your commander present himself in front of our army, put his head between his legs and kiss his - - -." Uh, huh. In the film, Wallace's chief antagonist is King Edward I ("Longshanks"), played by Patrick McGoohan with sly cunning; he is constantly giving his realpolitik interpretation of events, and that's all the more amusing since he's usually guessing wrong. Edward's son, the Prince of Wales (Peter Hanly), is an effete fop who marries a French woman only for political reasons. "I may have to conceive the child myself!" Longshanks says, and indeed, under the medieval concept of prima nocte, or "first night," nobles were allowed a first chance to sleep with the wives of their lessers. The Princess, played by the French actress Sophie Marceau, does not much admire her husband, who spends most of his time hanging about moon-eyed with his best friend (until the king, in a fit of impatience, hurls the friend out the castle window). Edward, smarting from defeats, dispatches the Princess to offer his terms to Braveheart, but soon she's spilling all the state secrets, "because of the way you look at me." The Princess is the second love in Wallace's life; the first, his childhood sweetheart Murron (Catherine McCormack), marries him in secret (so the local English lord won't claim his rights). The two spend their wedding night outdoors, and the backlit shot as they embrace gains something, I think, from the frost on their breaths. These characters come from hardened stock. (When Wallace has a reunion with his childhood pal Hamish, they hurl rocks at each other for entertainment; later, when a Scotsman has his wound cauterized, all he says is, "That'll wake you up in the morning, boy!") It is sometimes seen as an egotistical gesture when actors direct themselves, especially in heroic epics costing (so they say) $53 million. The truth is, given this material, I do not know that anyone could have directed it better. Gibson marshals his armies of extras, his stunt men and his special effects, and creates a fictional world that is entertaining, and thrilling. And as Braveheart, Gibson plays his role with flamboyance, and cuts it with sly humor. He is an amazing battlefield strategist, inventing new strategies and weapons, outsmarting the English at every turn, leading his men into battle with his face painted blue, like a football fan. There is a scene where he is so pumped up with the scent of battle that his nostrils flare; not many actors could get away with that, but Gibson can.

    Braveheart is actually one of my favorite movies i've seen so far. It's story about one man giving his life for his country, for his people. His name is William Wallace, Scotish hero who fought for his country. Storyline is, in my opinion, amazing. It show us that some stuff are worth of our life, like safeness of our people, our nation, our kids, our family, that's main point of this movie. It also show us that sometimes even our own brothers can betray us. Freedom is something worth of fighting, something that takes a life. To reach it you gonna take all risk you gonna meet. Also movie full of good quotes...

    So many reviews have been written about this film during the last two decades so I won't be extensive. Simply THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE! I always knew this from the beginning... My opinion has never changed since back in 1995 when I first watched it, I've seen it many many time and never been tired of it. This movie works on so many levels (Plot, script, cast, action sequences) but the main one is the acting of Mel Gibson because HE IS DIRECTING HIMSELF. He knew exactly was he was doing. BRAVISSIMO. Mel's best recitation ( his second is "The Man Without a Face"). Masterpiece. Excellent. Another great element is the score by James Horner without any doubt his best score ever (his second best is Legend of the falls, then Avatar) and Mel manages to match it perfectly with his images. A PERFECT MOVIE. MAGISTRALMENTE executed!!!

    I was excited to see this movie. It won 5 Oscars, it has supposedly great acting, and is apparently very exciting and inspiring to many of the people who have seen it. However, I tried to watch this movie and was so repelled by Mel Gibson's flat, bland, pathetic performance and the pretentious and simplistic plot that I could not finish it. Mel Gibson is absolutely terrible in this film. His character is completely one-dimensional and his romance is absolutely unbelievable. He looks completely ridiculous with 3 foot long hair and he is very conspicuously miscast. The camera lingers on his epic feats and heroic poses and I wondered sometimes if the movie was more a Mel Gibson montage or a biopic (which it really isn't anyway). From what I have heard, this movie completely butchered history. It is known to be one of the most inaccurate biopics ever created. And if this is true, then how on earth can it be "inspiring," "breathtaking," even good?! This is truly an insult to cinema and history. 1/10

    Provoked into resistance by the savage murder of his wife, William Wallace leads the Scots in a fight for independence from English oppression. Braveheart, Mel Gibson's finest hour, deserves its Oscars - it is a fine film, epic in scale, well acted, brilliantly directed, full of iconic sequences and moments. On the downside, it is violent, and Gibson's favourite dislike after the Jews, the English, are monsterised as subtext (see also The Patriot). This does not diminish Braveheart as a film, it just adds to one's knowledge. It doesn't help me like Gibson, although it gives me great cause to admire him as an actor and director.

On the downside, it is violent, and Gibson's favourite dislike after the Jews, the English, are monsterised as subtext (see also The Patriot). This does not diminish Braveheart as a film, it just adds to one's knowledge. It doesn't help me like Gibson, although it gives me great cause to admire him as an actor and director.

    This film is a racist, sexist, homophobic piece of Nazi propaganda by the anti-semitic bipolar alcoholic Mel Gibson. It is absolutely disgusting that the film could pretend that King Edward II was some kind of effeminate homosexual when in actual fact he was a tall, bearded, physically strong warrior just like his father. Edward II fathered at least five children by several different women, and he died of old age in exile. Mel Gibson is a Nazi and this film is just a made up, historically worthless, fictional piece of crap. Gibson was far too old to play Wallace and his "Scottish" accent was as bad as his awful ginger wig. Patrick McGoohan gives a stupid one-note performance as Edward I. Also Robert the Bruce (the real "Braveheart") never betrayed Wallace, the Battle of Stirling Bridge should have been filmed at a, er, bridge, and the "evil" English only invaded Scotland after the Scots had allied with France and Norway in a war against the English. 0/10. PS: I hope any Americans watching this made up tripe are aware that over 90% of people in England strongly support Scottish "independence", and that if a referendum on Scotland's "independence" (in the EU!!!) was held south of the border then Scotland would be long gone.

    Braveheart is an absolute fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline that contains both a lot of action and a lot of heart,with very strong,powerful and inspired performances.Even for people who aren't from Scotland,this movie gives you great pride from the country you came from,it is all beautifully made and William Wallace is without a doubt Mel Gibson's finest performance,and his most impressive movie as a director.I also loved Brendan Gleeson in this movie,he isn't a very important character,but he is such a good actor and gave me so much pride for the country I come from,Ireland.Braveheart is a highly recommend movie for all moviegoers,those five Academy Awards don't lie. After his wife is sentenced to death by an English soldier,William Wallace leads a group of Scottish warriors to battle against the English for their countries freedom.

    In typical Hollywood fashion, "Braveheart" delivers a sturdy tagline as a sort of moral: "Every man dies, but not every man really lives." That is particularly true of Mel Gibson movies, where you can be assured that nearly everyone will die in very bloody and gruesome Medieval fashion, and that most of them won't be given the chance to really live. (Although the film's portrayal of 13th-century Scotland looks so miserable, I can't fathom why any of them would bother.) But what about Mel? History dictates that Mel, as the eponymous -- sort of -- hero, will have to really die. But does he really live? Let's see what Mel and his screenwriter, Randall Wallace, offer as a definition of "really living": 1. William Wallace's wife is murdered the day after their wedding. 2. Wallace's rampage of revenge incites a bloody insurrection. 3. A pitched battle is fought, leading to hundreds of dead Englishmen and horses and hundreds of exposed Scottish backsides. 4. Wallace has a clandestine affair with the French princess -- who, according to history, was nine years old, but never mind. 5. Wallace is betrayed, captured, and messily tortured and executed in an extended climax that reaches a sort of feverish apotheosis with Mel screaming "FREEEEDOM" with blood and spittle flying from his lips. Gosh. If that's what they think "really living" is all about, I've got a long way to go. Messrs. Gibson and Wallace (Randall, not William...) have settled on a rather ruthless and violent idea of what life is all about, and their concept of "freedom" seems equally brutal. Revenge, philandering, pedophilia, gory disembowelings -- is that sort of freedom really worth it?

    It's only Mel's second time at the helm, and he goes and knocks this baby outta the park. I'm no Scot, but Gibson convinced me he was. And I dare say he (and the terrific script) make William Wallace one of the cinematic greats. Longshanks is a grade-A son-of-a-bitch, played with sinister glee by Patrick McGoohan. Even Sophie Marceau holds her own here. Everything about "Braveheart" is incredibly well-done; the righteous battle scenes (thoroughly gripping and just violent enough), the cinematography, the writing, directing, acting ... all of it. It even features possibly the most heartbreaking torture scene I've ever seen. And all of this is set to a supremely heartfelt and rousing score. And despite its 3-hour running time, "Braveheart" is never boring. My only regret is waiting almost twenty years to finally see it. 9/10

    Mel Gibson's "Braveheart" is a full-throated, red-blooded battle epic about William Wallace, the legendary Scots warrior who led his nation into battle against the English in the years around 1300. It's an ambitious film, big on simple emotions like love, patriotism and treachery, and avoids the travelogue style of so many historical swashbucklers: Its locations look green, wet, vast, muddy and rugged. Not much is known about Wallace, known as Braveheart, except that according to an old epic poem, he unified the clans of Scotland and won famous battles against the English before being captured, tortured and executed as a traitor. Wallace's dying cry, as his body was stretched on the rack, was "freedom!" That isn't exactly based on fact (the concept of personal freedom was a concept not much celebrated in 1300), but it doesn't stop Gibson from making it his dying cry. It fits in with the whole glorious sweep of "Braveheart," which is an action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of "The Road Warrior." What people are going to remember from the film are the battle scenes, which are frequent, bloody and violent. Just from a technical point of view, "Braveheart" does a brilliant job of massing men and horses for large-scale warfare on film. Gibson deploys what look like thousands of men on horseback, as well as foot soldiers, archers and dirty tricks specialists, and yet his battle sequences don't turn into confusing crowd scenes: We understand the strategy, and we enjoy the tactics even while we're doubting some of them (did 14th century Scots really set battlefields aflame?). Gibson is not filming history here, but myth. William Wallace may have been a real person, but "Braveheart" owes more to Prince Valiant, Rob Roy and Mad Max. Once we understand that this is not a solemn historical reconstruction (and that happens pretty fast), we accept dialogue that might otherwise have an uncannily modern tone, as when Braveheart issues his victory ultimatum to the English: "Scotland's terms are that your commander present himself in front of our army, put his head between his legs and kiss his - - -." Uh, huh. In the film, Wallace's chief antagonist is King Edward I ("Longshanks"), played by Patrick McGoohan with sly cunning; he is constantly giving his realpolitik interpretation of events, and that's all the more amusing since he's usually guessing wrong. Edward's son, the Prince of Wales (Peter Hanly), is an effete fop who marries a French woman only for political reasons. "I may have to conceive the child myself!" Longshanks says, and indeed, under the medieval concept of prima nocte, or "first night," nobles were allowed a first chance to sleep with the wives of their lessers. The Princess, played by the French actress Sophie Marceau, does not much admire her husband, who spends most of his time hanging about moon-eyed with his best friend (until the king, in a fit of impatience, hurls the friend out the castle window). Edward, smarting from defeats, dispatches the Princess to offer his terms to Braveheart, but soon she's spilling all the state secrets, "because of the way you look at me." The Princess is the second love in Wallace's life; the first, his childhood sweetheart Murron (Catherine McCormack), marries him in secret (so the local English lord won't claim his rights). The two spend their wedding night outdoors, and the backlit shot as they embrace gains something, I think, from the frost on their breaths. These characters come from hardened stock. (When Wallace has a reunion with his childhood pal Hamish, they hurl rocks at each other for entertainment; later, when a Scotsman has his wound cauterized, all he says is, "That'll wake you up in the morning, boy!") It is sometimes seen as an egotistical gesture when actors direct themselves, especially in heroic epics costing (so they say) $53 million. The truth is, given this material, I do not know that anyone could have directed it better. Gibson marshals his armies of extras, his stunt men and his special effects, and creates a fictional world that is entertaining, and thrilling. And as Braveheart, Gibson plays his role with flamboyance, and cuts it with sly humor. He is an amazing battlefield strategist, inventing new strategies and weapons, outsmarting the English at every turn, leading his men into battle with his face painted blue, like a football fan. There is a scene where he is so pumped up with the scent of battle that his nostrils flare; not many actors could get away with that, but Gibson can.

    Braveheart is actually one of my favorite movies i've seen so far. It's story about one man giving his life for his country, for his people. His name is William Wallace, Scotish hero who fought for his country. Storyline is, in my opinion, amazing. It show us that some stuff are worth of our life, like safeness of our people, our nation, our kids, our family, that's main point of this movie. It also show us that sometimes even our own brothers can betray us. Freedom is something worth of fighting, something that takes a life. To reach it you gonna take all risk you gonna meet. Also movie full of good quotes...

    So many reviews have been written about this film during the last two decades so I won't be extensive. Simply THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE! I always knew this from the beginning... My opinion has never changed since back in 1995 when I first watched it, I've seen it many many time and never been tired of it. This movie works on so many levels (Plot, script, cast, action sequences) but the main one is the acting of Mel Gibson because HE IS DIRECTING HIMSELF. He knew exactly was he was doing. BRAVISSIMO. Mel's best recitation ( his second is "The Man Without a Face"). Masterpiece. Excellent. Another great element is the score by James Horner without any doubt his best score ever (his second best is Legend of the falls, then Avatar) and Mel manages to match it perfectly with his images. A PERFECT MOVIE. MAGISTRALMENTE executed!!!

    I was excited to see this movie. It won 5 Oscars, it has supposedly great acting, and is apparently very exciting and inspiring to many of the people who have seen it. However, I tried to watch this movie and was so repelled by Mel Gibson's flat, bland, pathetic performance and the pretentious and simplistic plot that I could not finish it. Mel Gibson is absolutely terrible in this film. His character is completely one-dimensional and his romance is absolutely unbelievable. He looks completely ridiculous with 3 foot long hair and he is very conspicuously miscast. The camera lingers on his epic feats and heroic poses and I wondered sometimes if the movie was more a Mel Gibson montage or a biopic (which it really isn't anyway). From what I have heard, this movie completely butchered history. It is known to be one of the most inaccurate biopics ever created. And if this is true, then how on earth can it be "inspiring," "breathtaking," even good?! This is truly an insult to cinema and history. 1/10

    Provoked into resistance by the savage murder of his wife, William Wallace leads the Scots in a fight for independence from English oppression. Braveheart, Mel Gibson's finest hour, deserves its Oscars - it is a fine film, epic in scale, well acted, brilliantly directed, full of iconic sequences and moments. On the downside, it is violent, and Gibson's favourite dislike after the Jews, the English, are monsterised as subtext (see also The Patriot). This does not diminish Braveheart as a film, it just adds to one's knowledge. It doesn't help me like Gibson, although it gives me great cause to admire him as an actor and director.

    This film is a racist, sexist, homophobic piece of Nazi propaganda by the anti-semitic bipolar alcoholic Mel Gibson. It is absolutely disgusting that the film could pretend that King Edward II was some kind of effeminate homosexual when in actual fact he was a tall, bearded, physically strong warrior just like his father. Edward II fathered at least five children by several different women, and he died of old age in exile. Mel Gibson is a Nazi and this film is just a made up, historically worthless, fictional piece of crap. Gibson was far too old to play Wallace and his "Scottish" accent was as bad as his awful ginger wig. Patrick McGoohan gives a stupid one-note performance as Edward I. Also Robert the Bruce (the real "Braveheart") never betrayed Wallace, the Battle of Stirling Bridge should have been filmed at a, er, bridge, and the "evil" English only invaded Scotland after the Scots had allied with France and Norway in a war against the English. 0/10. PS: I hope any Americans watching this made up tripe are aware that over 90% of people in England strongly support Scottish "independence", and that if a referendum on Scotland's "independence" (in the EU!!!) was held south of the border then Scotland would be long gone.

    Braveheart is an absolute fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline that contains both a lot of action and a lot of heart,with very strong,powerful and inspired performances.Even for people who aren't from Scotland,this movie gives you great pride from the country you came from,it is all beautifully made and William Wallace is without a doubt Mel Gibson's finest performance,and his most impressive movie as a director.I also loved Brendan Gleeson in this movie,he isn't a very important character,but he is such a good actor and gave me so much pride for the country I come from,Ireland.Braveheart is a highly recommend movie for all moviegoers,those five Academy Awards don't lie. After his wife is sentenced to death by an English soldier,William Wallace leads a group of Scottish warriors to battle against the English for their countries freedom.

    In typical Hollywood fashion, "Braveheart" delivers a sturdy tagline as a sort of moral: "Every man dies, but not every man really lives." That is particularly true of Mel Gibson movies, where you can be assured that nearly everyone will die in very bloody and gruesome Medieval fashion, and that most of them won't be given the chance to really live. (Although the film's portrayal of 13th-century Scotland looks so miserable, I can't fathom why any of them would bother.) But what about Mel? History dictates that Mel, as the eponymous -- sort of -- hero, will have to really die. But does he really live? Let's see what Mel and his screenwriter, Randall Wallace, offer as a definition of "really living": 1. William Wallace's wife is murdered the day after their wedding. 2. Wallace's rampage of revenge incites a bloody insurrection. 3. A pitched battle is fought, leading to hundreds of dead Englishmen and horses and hundreds of exposed Scottish backsides. 4. Wallace has a clandestine affair with the French princess -- who, according to history, was nine years old, but never mind. 5. Wallace is betrayed, captured, and messily tortured and executed in an extended climax that reaches a sort of feverish apotheosis with Mel screaming "FREEEEDOM" with blood and spittle flying from his lips. Gosh. If that's what they think "really living" is all about, I've got a long way to go. Messrs. Gibson and Wallace (Randall, not William...) have settled on a rather ruthless and violent idea of what life is all about, and their concept of "freedom" seems equally brutal. Revenge, philandering, pedophilia, gory disembowelings -- is that sort of freedom really worth it?

    It's only Mel's second time at the helm, and he goes and knocks this baby outta the park. I'm no Scot, but Gibson convinced me he was. And I dare say he (and the terrific script) make William Wallace one of the cinematic greats. Longshanks is a grade-A son-of-a-bitch, played with sinister glee by Patrick McGoohan. Even Sophie Marceau holds her own here. Everything about "Braveheart" is incredibly well-done; the righteous battle scenes (thoroughly gripping and just violent enough), the cinematography, the writing, directing, acting ... all of it. It even features possibly the most heartbreaking torture scene I've ever seen. And all of this is set to a supremely heartfelt and rousing score. And despite its 3-hour running time, "Braveheart" is never boring. My only regret is waiting almost twenty years to finally see it. 9/10

    Mel Gibson's "Braveheart" is a full-throated, red-blooded battle epic about William Wallace, the legendary Scots warrior who led his nation into battle against the English in the years around 1300. It's an ambitious film, big on simple emotions like love, patriotism and treachery, and avoids the travelogue style of so many historical swashbucklers: Its locations look green, wet, vast, muddy and rugged. Not much is known about Wallace, known as Braveheart, except that according to an old epic poem, he unified the clans of Scotland and won famous battles against the English before being captured, tortured and executed as a traitor. Wallace's dying cry, as his body was stretched on the rack, was "freedom!" That isn't exactly based on fact (the concept of personal freedom was a concept not much celebrated in 1300), but it doesn't stop Gibson from making it his dying cry. It fits in with the whole glorious sweep of "Braveheart," which is an action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of "The Road Warrior." What people are going to remember from the film are the battle scenes, which are frequent, bloody and violent. Just from a technical point of view, "Braveheart" does a brilliant job of massing men and horses for large-scale warfare on film. Gibson deploys what look like thousands of men on horseback, as well as foot soldiers, archers and dirty tricks specialists, and yet his battle sequences don't turn into confusing crowd scenes: We understand the strategy, and we enjoy the tactics even while we're doubting some of them (did 14th century Scots really set battlefields aflame?). Gibson is not filming history here, but myth. William Wallace may have been a real person, but "Braveheart" owes more to Prince Valiant, Rob Roy and Mad Max. Once we understand that this is not a solemn historical reconstruction (and that happens pretty fast), we accept dialogue that might otherwise have an uncannily modern tone, as when Braveheart issues his victory ultimatum to the English: "Scotland's terms are that your commander present himself in front of our army, put his head between his legs and kiss his - - -." Uh, huh. In the film, Wallace's chief antagonist is King Edward I ("Longshanks"), played by Patrick McGoohan with sly cunning; he is constantly giving his realpolitik interpretation of events, and that's all the more amusing since he's usually guessing wrong. Edward's son, the Prince of Wales (Peter Hanly), is an effete fop who marries a French woman only for political reasons. "I may have to conceive the child myself!" Longshanks says, and indeed, under the medieval concept of prima nocte, or "first night," nobles were allowed a first chance to sleep with the wives of their lessers. The Princess, played by the French actress Sophie Marceau, does not much admire her husband, who spends most of his time hanging about moon-eyed with his best friend (until the king, in a fit of impatience, hurls the friend out the castle window). Edward, smarting from defeats, dispatches the Princess to offer his terms to Braveheart, but soon she's spilling all the state secrets, "because of the way you look at me." The Princess is the second love in Wallace's life; the first, his childhood sweetheart Murron (Catherine McCormack), marries him in secret (so the local English lord won't claim his rights). The two spend their wedding night outdoors, and the backlit shot as they embrace gains something, I think, from the frost on their breaths. These characters come from hardened stock. (When Wallace has a reunion with his childhood pal Hamish, they hurl rocks at each other for entertainment; later, when a Scotsman has his wound cauterized, all he says is, "That'll wake you up in the morning, boy!") It is sometimes seen as an egotistical gesture when actors direct themselves, especially in heroic epics costing (so they say) $53 million. The truth is, given this material, I do not know that anyone could have directed it better. Gibson marshals his armies of extras, his stunt men and his special effects, and creates a fictional world that is entertaining, and thrilling. And as Braveheart, Gibson plays his role with flamboyance, and cuts it with sly humor. He is an amazing battlefield strategist, inventing new strategies and weapons, outsmarting the English at every turn, leading his men into battle with his face painted blue, like a football fan. There is a scene where he is so pumped up with the scent of battle that his nostrils flare; not many actors could get away with that, but Gibson can.

    Braveheart is actually one of my favorite movies i've seen so far. It's story about one man giving his life for his country, for his people. His name is William Wallace, Scotish hero who fought for his country. Storyline is, in my opinion, amazing. It show us that some stuff are worth of our life, like safeness of our people, our nation, our kids, our family, that's main point of this movie. It also show us that sometimes even our own brothers can betray us. Freedom is something worth of fighting, something that takes a life. To reach it you gonna take all risk you gonna meet. Also movie full of good quotes...

    So many reviews have been written about this film during the last two decades so I won't be extensive. Simply THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE! I always knew this from the beginning... My opinion has never changed since back in 1995 when I first watched it, I've seen it many many time and never been tired of it. This movie works on so many levels (Plot, script, cast, action sequences) but the main one is the acting of Mel Gibson because HE IS DIRECTING HIMSELF. He knew exactly was he was doing. BRAVISSIMO. Mel's best recitation ( his second is "The Man Without a Face"). Masterpiece. Excellent. Another great element is the score by James Horner without any doubt his best score ever (his second best is Legend of the falls, then Avatar) and Mel manages to match it perfectly with his images. A PERFECT MOVIE. MAGISTRALMENTE executed!!!

    I was excited to see this movie. It won 5 Oscars, it has supposedly great acting, and is apparently very exciting and inspiring to many of the people who have seen it. However, I tried to watch this movie and was so repelled by Mel Gibson's flat, bland, pathetic performance and the pretentious and simplistic plot that I could not finish it. Mel Gibson is absolutely terrible in this film. His character is completely one-dimensional and his romance is absolutely unbelievable. He looks completely ridiculous with 3 foot long hair and he is very conspicuously miscast. The camera lingers on his epic feats and heroic poses and I wondered sometimes if the movie was more a Mel Gibson montage or a biopic (which it really isn't anyway). From what I have heard, this movie completely butchered history. It is known to be one of the most inaccurate biopics ever created. And if this is true, then how on earth can it be "inspiring," "breathtaking," even good?! This is truly an insult to cinema and history. 1/10

The camera lingers on his epic feats and heroic poses and I wondered sometimes if the movie was more a Mel Gibson montage or a biopic (which it really isn't anyway). From what I have heard, this movie completely butchered history. It is known to be one of the most inaccurate biopics ever created. And if this is true, then how on earth can it be "inspiring," "breathtaking," even good?! This is truly an insult to cinema and history. 1/10

    Provoked into resistance by the savage murder of his wife, William Wallace leads the Scots in a fight for independence from English oppression. Braveheart, Mel Gibson's finest hour, deserves its Oscars - it is a fine film, epic in scale, well acted, brilliantly directed, full of iconic sequences and moments. On the downside, it is violent, and Gibson's favourite dislike after the Jews, the English, are monsterised as subtext (see also The Patriot). This does not diminish Braveheart as a film, it just adds to one's knowledge. It doesn't help me like Gibson, although it gives me great cause to admire him as an actor and director.

    This film is a racist, sexist, homophobic piece of Nazi propaganda by the anti-semitic bipolar alcoholic Mel Gibson. It is absolutely disgusting that the film could pretend that King Edward II was some kind of effeminate homosexual when in actual fact he was a tall, bearded, physically strong warrior just like his father. Edward II fathered at least five children by several different women, and he died of old age in exile. Mel Gibson is a Nazi and this film is just a made up, historically worthless, fictional piece of crap. Gibson was far too old to play Wallace and his "Scottish" accent was as bad as his awful ginger wig. Patrick McGoohan gives a stupid one-note performance as Edward I. Also Robert the Bruce (the real "Braveheart") never betrayed Wallace, the Battle of Stirling Bridge should have been filmed at a, er, bridge, and the "evil" English only invaded Scotland after the Scots had allied with France and Norway in a war against the English. 0/10. PS: I hope any Americans watching this made up tripe are aware that over 90% of people in England strongly support Scottish "independence", and that if a referendum on Scotland's "independence" (in the EU!!!) was held south of the border then Scotland would be long gone.

    Braveheart is an absolute fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline that contains both a lot of action and a lot of heart,with very strong,powerful and inspired performances.Even for people who aren't from Scotland,this movie gives you great pride from the country you came from,it is all beautifully made and William Wallace is without a doubt Mel Gibson's finest performance,and his most impressive movie as a director.I also loved Brendan Gleeson in this movie,he isn't a very important character,but he is such a good actor and gave me so much pride for the country I come from,Ireland.Braveheart is a highly recommend movie for all moviegoers,those five Academy Awards don't lie. After his wife is sentenced to death by an English soldier,William Wallace leads a group of Scottish warriors to battle against the English for their countries freedom.

    In typical Hollywood fashion, "Braveheart" delivers a sturdy tagline as a sort of moral: "Every man dies, but not every man really lives." That is particularly true of Mel Gibson movies, where you can be assured that nearly everyone will die in very bloody and gruesome Medieval fashion, and that most of them won't be given the chance to really live. (Although the film's portrayal of 13th-century Scotland looks so miserable, I can't fathom why any of them would bother.) But what about Mel? History dictates that Mel, as the eponymous -- sort of -- hero, will have to really die. But does he really live? Let's see what Mel and his screenwriter, Randall Wallace, offer as a definition of "really living": 1. William Wallace's wife is murdered the day after their wedding. 2. Wallace's rampage of revenge incites a bloody insurrection. 3. A pitched battle is fought, leading to hundreds of dead Englishmen and horses and hundreds of exposed Scottish backsides. 4. Wallace has a clandestine affair with the French princess -- who, according to history, was nine years old, but never mind. 5. Wallace is betrayed, captured, and messily tortured and executed in an extended climax that reaches a sort of feverish apotheosis with Mel screaming "FREEEEDOM" with blood and spittle flying from his lips. Gosh. If that's what they think "really living" is all about, I've got a long way to go. Messrs. Gibson and Wallace (Randall, not William...) have settled on a rather ruthless and violent idea of what life is all about, and their concept of "freedom" seems equally brutal. Revenge, philandering, pedophilia, gory disembowelings -- is that sort of freedom really worth it?

    It's only Mel's second time at the helm, and he goes and knocks this baby outta the park. I'm no Scot, but Gibson convinced me he was. And I dare say he (and the terrific script) make William Wallace one of the cinematic greats. Longshanks is a grade-A son-of-a-bitch, played with sinister glee by Patrick McGoohan. Even Sophie Marceau holds her own here. Everything about "Braveheart" is incredibly well-done; the righteous battle scenes (thoroughly gripping and just violent enough), the cinematography, the writing, directing, acting ... all of it. It even features possibly the most heartbreaking torture scene I've ever seen. And all of this is set to a supremely heartfelt and rousing score. And despite its 3-hour running time, "Braveheart" is never boring. My only regret is waiting almost twenty years to finally see it. 9/10

    Mel Gibson's "Braveheart" is a full-throated, red-blooded battle epic about William Wallace, the legendary Scots warrior who led his nation into battle against the English in the years around 1300. It's an ambitious film, big on simple emotions like love, patriotism and treachery, and avoids the travelogue style of so many historical swashbucklers: Its locations look green, wet, vast, muddy and rugged. Not much is known about Wallace, known as Braveheart, except that according to an old epic poem, he unified the clans of Scotland and won famous battles against the English before being captured, tortured and executed as a traitor. Wallace's dying cry, as his body was stretched on the rack, was "freedom!" That isn't exactly based on fact (the concept of personal freedom was a concept not much celebrated in 1300), but it doesn't stop Gibson from making it his dying cry. It fits in with the whole glorious sweep of "Braveheart," which is an action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of "The Road Warrior." What people are going to remember from the film are the battle scenes, which are frequent, bloody and violent. Just from a technical point of view, "Braveheart" does a brilliant job of massing men and horses for large-scale warfare on film. Gibson deploys what look like thousands of men on horseback, as well as foot soldiers, archers and dirty tricks specialists, and yet his battle sequences don't turn into confusing crowd scenes: We understand the strategy, and we enjoy the tactics even while we're doubting some of them (did 14th century Scots really set battlefields aflame?). Gibson is not filming history here, but myth. William Wallace may have been a real person, but "Braveheart" owes more to Prince Valiant, Rob Roy and Mad Max. Once we understand that this is not a solemn historical reconstruction (and that happens pretty fast), we accept dialogue that might otherwise have an uncannily modern tone, as when Braveheart issues his victory ultimatum to the English: "Scotland's terms are that your commander present himself in front of our army, put his head between his legs and kiss his - - -." Uh, huh. In the film, Wallace's chief antagonist is King Edward I ("Longshanks"), played by Patrick McGoohan with sly cunning; he is constantly giving his realpolitik interpretation of events, and that's all the more amusing since he's usually guessing wrong. Edward's son, the Prince of Wales (Peter Hanly), is an effete fop who marries a French woman only for political reasons. "I may have to conceive the child myself!" Longshanks says, and indeed, under the medieval concept of prima nocte, or "first night," nobles were allowed a first chance to sleep with the wives of their lessers. The Princess, played by the French actress Sophie Marceau, does not much admire her husband, who spends most of his time hanging about moon-eyed with his best friend (until the king, in a fit of impatience, hurls the friend out the castle window). Edward, smarting from defeats, dispatches the Princess to offer his terms to Braveheart, but soon she's spilling all the state secrets, "because of the way you look at me." The Princess is the second love in Wallace's life; the first, his childhood sweetheart Murron (Catherine McCormack), marries him in secret (so the local English lord won't claim his rights). The two spend their wedding night outdoors, and the backlit shot as they embrace gains something, I think, from the frost on their breaths. These characters come from hardened stock. (When Wallace has a reunion with his childhood pal Hamish, they hurl rocks at each other for entertainment; later, when a Scotsman has his wound cauterized, all he says is, "That'll wake you up in the morning, boy!") It is sometimes seen as an egotistical gesture when actors direct themselves, especially in heroic epics costing (so they say) $53 million. The truth is, given this material, I do not know that anyone could have directed it better. Gibson marshals his armies of extras, his stunt men and his special effects, and creates a fictional world that is entertaining, and thrilling. And as Braveheart, Gibson plays his role with flamboyance, and cuts it with sly humor. He is an amazing battlefield strategist, inventing new strategies and weapons, outsmarting the English at every turn, leading his men into battle with his face painted blue, like a football fan. There is a scene where he is so pumped up with the scent of battle that his nostrils flare; not many actors could get away with that, but Gibson can.

    Braveheart is actually one of my favorite movies i've seen so far. It's story about one man giving his life for his country, for his people. His name is William Wallace, Scotish hero who fought for his country. Storyline is, in my opinion, amazing. It show us that some stuff are worth of our life, like safeness of our people, our nation, our kids, our family, that's main point of this movie. It also show us that sometimes even our own brothers can betray us. Freedom is something worth of fighting, something that takes a life. To reach it you gonna take all risk you gonna meet. Also movie full of good quotes...

    So many reviews have been written about this film during the last two decades so I won't be extensive. Simply THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE! I always knew this from the beginning... My opinion has never changed since back in 1995 when I first watched it, I've seen it many many time and never been tired of it. This movie works on so many levels (Plot, script, cast, action sequences) but the main one is the acting of Mel Gibson because HE IS DIRECTING HIMSELF. He knew exactly was he was doing. BRAVISSIMO. Mel's best recitation ( his second is "The Man Without a Face"). Masterpiece. Excellent. Another great element is the score by James Horner without any doubt his best score ever (his second best is Legend of the falls, then Avatar) and Mel manages to match it perfectly with his images. A PERFECT MOVIE. MAGISTRALMENTE executed!!!

    I was excited to see this movie. It won 5 Oscars, it has supposedly great acting, and is apparently very exciting and inspiring to many of the people who have seen it. However, I tried to watch this movie and was so repelled by Mel Gibson's flat, bland, pathetic performance and the pretentious and simplistic plot that I could not finish it. Mel Gibson is absolutely terrible in this film. His character is completely one-dimensional and his romance is absolutely unbelievable. He looks completely ridiculous with 3 foot long hair and he is very conspicuously miscast. The camera lingers on his epic feats and heroic poses and I wondered sometimes if the movie was more a Mel Gibson montage or a biopic (which it really isn't anyway).

    I was excited to see this movie. It won 5 Oscars, it has supposedly great acting, and is apparently very exciting and inspiring to many of the people who have seen it. However, I tried to watch this movie and was so repelled by Mel Gibson's flat, bland, pathetic performance and the pretentious and simplistic plot that I could not finish it. Mel Gibson is absolutely terrible in this film. His character is completely one-dimensional and his romance is absolutely unbelievable. He looks completely ridiculous with 3 foot long hair and he is very conspicuously miscast. The camera lingers on his epic feats and heroic poses and I wondered sometimes if the movie was more a Mel Gibson montage or a biopic (which it really isn't anyway). From what I have heard, this movie completely butchered history. It is known to be one of the most inaccurate biopics ever created. And if this is true, then how on earth can it be "inspiring," "breathtaking," even good?! This is truly an insult to cinema and history. 1/10

    Provoked into resistance by the savage murder of his wife, William Wallace leads the Scots in a fight for independence from English oppression. Braveheart, Mel Gibson's finest hour, deserves its Oscars - it is a fine film, epic in scale, well acted, brilliantly directed, full of iconic sequences and moments. On the downside, it is violent, and Gibson's favourite dislike after the Jews, the English, are monsterised as subtext (see also The Patriot). This does not diminish Braveheart as a film, it just adds to one's knowledge. It doesn't help me like Gibson, although it gives me great cause to admire him as an actor and director.

    This film is a racist, sexist, homophobic piece of Nazi propaganda by the anti-semitic bipolar alcoholic Mel Gibson. It is absolutely disgusting that the film could pretend that King Edward II was some kind of effeminate homosexual when in actual fact he was a tall, bearded, physically strong warrior just like his father. Edward II fathered at least five children by several different women, and he died of old age in exile. Mel Gibson is a Nazi and this film is just a made up, historically worthless, fictional piece of crap. Gibson was far too old to play Wallace and his "Scottish" accent was as bad as his awful ginger wig. Patrick McGoohan gives a stupid one-note performance as Edward I. Also Robert the Bruce (the real "Braveheart") never betrayed Wallace, the Battle of Stirling Bridge should have been filmed at a, er, bridge, and the "evil" English only invaded Scotland after the Scots had allied with France and Norway in a war against the English. 0/10. PS: I hope any Americans watching this made up tripe are aware that over 90% of people in England strongly support Scottish "independence", and that if a referendum on Scotland's "independence" (in the EU!!!) was held south of the border then Scotland would be long gone.

    Braveheart is an absolute fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline that contains both a lot of action and a lot of heart,with very strong,powerful and inspired performances.Even for people who aren't from Scotland,this movie gives you great pride from the country you came from,it is all beautifully made and William Wallace is without a doubt Mel Gibson's finest performance,and his most impressive movie as a director.I also loved Brendan Gleeson in this movie,he isn't a very important character,but he is such a good actor and gave me so much pride for the country I come from,Ireland.Braveheart is a highly recommend movie for all moviegoers,those five Academy Awards don't lie. After his wife is sentenced to death by an English soldier,William Wallace leads a group of Scottish warriors to battle against the English for their countries freedom.
