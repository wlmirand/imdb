    Steven Spielberg returned to direct this sequel,(loosely) based on the Michael Crichton novel that sees Jeff Goldblum returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who is enlisted by John Hammond(Richard Attenborough again) to return to Jurassic Park(though on previously unmentioned Site B) to study the dinosaur population, and also to rescue another team, which includes a former flame of his(played by Julianne Moore). He reluctantly agrees, and after locating her, finds to their disgust that the company INGEN has allowed hunting parties to take place, where big-game hunters(led by Pete Postlethwaite) stalk and kill dinosaurs, though the tables would of course be turned... Good sequel has equally effective F/X and terrifying story, though a few too many characters; the twist toward the end is surprising and entertaining, though some poor editing leaves a big plot hole aboard the discovered freighter...still, a worthy sequel that holds up today.

    The Lost World: Jurassic Park is one of the worst sequels ever when comparing it to the original. The characters are ugly, the story is stupid, the only good things are the things reused again, the effects and the score. When a group of scientist go pack for research, they are unaware of another group of people that have plans of their own that bring mayhem among the group and put more people then we would want in trouble. Now like before, they must get help to leave the island before they are the dinosaurs' dinner. This film brought back Jeff Goldblum, but he is nothing like his character in the first movie and is not good as well as Julianne Moore with the best being Vince Vaughn but he is also just eh. They are lifeless souls, waiting to be dinner and are not heroes but pain in the necks. The film's story is rather silly as the scientist roam free so the other people go hunting for a T-Rex as they want to bring one back to San Diego, but it escapes and starts to eat people there while already almost killing everyone at the park but maybe 5 people. Turns out the dinosaur was mad because it wanted its baby, but how did it know it would be hear? The two good things I can pick up from this movie are the effects and score. It was as good as the first, but it's not good enough to help the film. Spielberg has made only one movie that I completely dislike and that's a shame since it could have been good, but we can only hope that it will get better or stop here. Me: D+

    Considered one of Steven Spielberg's worst films, "Jurassic Park: The Lost World" is also considered to be the worst film in the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. While the film does fail with some aspects of the film, it also has its strengths and brings new ideas to the "Jurassic Park" franchise. "Jurassic Park" is one of the films that I see that does not need to have a main antagonist. There are some films I feel like that where it is done well like "Aliens" or "Platoon", but "The Lost World" does not do this. The main antagonist of Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) is a stereotypical businessman who has no idea of what to do. While John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) was like this in the first film, he was not a stereotype, let alone an antagonist. The only thing done right is that he is the opposite of Hammond, being in it for the money while Hammond was in it just to bring something new to people. With the main antagonist comes the problem with the main character, Ian Malcolm. I have no problem with Jeff Goldblum and I loved the character in both the novelizations of "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World" and the first film. This is still the case with this movie but I do not think that Malcolm is a good main character. In the first movie, he was more of a foil character to oppose Hammond instead of someone who was main character material. Also, he still seems to be the designated guy who brings the comic relief. While I was okay with that in the first film, he should not of been like that this much when he was a main character. There were a lot of things I liked, though, as well. The characters are still somewhat interesting as opposed to the blank slates they are in "Jurassic Park III". Plus, the dinosaurs are fleshed out a little as shown being caring parents and not just giant monsters. Along with the fleshing out of the dinosaurs, there is another aspect of the film that I like involving the dinosaurs. The herbivores are dangerous, like they would be in real life which is glossed over in the first and second film. Stegosaurus attack Sarah, a Pachycephalosaurus attacks the mercenaries cars, and the herbivores trash the mercenaries camp. Yes, it is more of a dinosaur attack film but it does show us more of how the animals really would be and not the simple herbivores are nice and safe while the carnivores are mean and dangerous like the other two films do. Taking the pros with the cons, I liked this film and found that it was a good addition to the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. The effects were good, the story was interesting, and the action was superb and tense. While there are some pretty big flaws with the characters, they do not hurt the film a lot.

    Not quite as good as the first one only because several of the first movie cast was not in it. Sam Neill, Laura Dern are two that come to mind. This is still an excellent movie. Jeff Golblum is back as Doctor Ian Malcolm and does his usual good job. His character is still insightful and more importantly he still gets some humorous lines as well. Julianne Moore plays a very tunnel vision doctor that is more interested in the animals than in her own survival, at least at times. One of the not so good guys that are also on this island if the hunter played by Pete Postlethwaite. He is there for the protection but his personal objective is to bag a big one. Well it turns out he gets bagged.

    The first thing to know about 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is that it's not as good as 'Jurassic Park', which is a very high standard to reach. As a young boy, I had reservations about this movie, but it's actually started to slowly grow on me more over time. People may find this strange because of the huge amount of hate towards this film, but I find there's still merit to be found. Story: After a family on a yacht cruise discovers Isla Sorna, the factory floor island owned by InGen, and their daughter is attacked by a pack of compies, John Hammond is removed as CEO of InGen by his greedy nephew Peter Ludlow. Hammond summons Ian Malcolm, now scarred by experiences in Jurassic Park, and asks him to lead an expedition to document the dinosaurs (at a distance from the carnivores) to earn the government's protection. After discovering his girlfriend, Sarah Harding, is already there, Malcolm joins Nick Van Owen and Eddie Carr and sails to the island. Ludlow arrives with a taskforce led by Roland Tembo capture the dinosaurs and take them to San Diego to flaunt them in a zoo. At night, Nick sabotages the InGen camp and brings an injured baby T-Rex to their trailer to patch it's leg up after Roland had captured to bait the father Rex. The T-Rex parents soon retrieve the infant and push the trailer over a cliff, and Eddie is killed trying to save Malcolm and team before InGen arrives to help them out. Both stranded teams concede to join forces to get off the island. The film culminates in a fun (if divisive) 15-minute sequence when the male T-Rex rampages through San Diego searching for his infant, paying homage to 'King Kong' and 1925's 'The Lost World'. One key problem most people have with "The Lost World" is that it's not as filled with wonder as the original, and this film certainly could have benefited from more scenes with the herbivores and characters enjoying the island ambiance. Judging by some unrealistic moments and plot holes, such as the way the trailer fell or the scene where Malcolm's daughter is able to defeat a Raptor with gymnastics, and the fact that the crew of the ship holding the Rex was killed with no clue as to how it happened, Spielberg was not fully committed to this film, which is a real shame. The build-up is also fairly slow, but can be skipped. Personally, the infamous gymnastic scene just makes me chuckle, it's not worth getting angry over. And I admit that I relished in the Rex's travels in San Diego and his reunion with the once-again captured infant. Another major criticism is that main characters cause more death and destruction than the InGen team, and that is partially true. Sarah cannot seem to keep away from dangerous dinosaurs in the field and can be annoying at times, but she still helps lead the T-Rex away from civilians in San Diego. However, Nick is just awful; he's a self- righteous environmentalist whose actions include releasing the captive dinosaurs on the InGen team and stealing the bullets from Roland's rifle to prevent the T-Rex from being killed, thus putting more people in danger. Frankly, I regard him as a hidden antagonist responsible for the chaos, thankfully he's absent from the San Diego sequence. Ultimately, the lack of defined heroes and villains feels more in keeping with the grimness of Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park novel, which was very cynical, and potentially disconcerting to certain people. In this movie's defence, some characters do stand out in a positive light; Ian Malcolm is just as eccentric and witty as ever if more cynical (Jeff Goldblum an acquired taste, really). Another worthy character is Eddie Carr, who is killed by the T-Rexes in the act of saving Malcolm, Sarah and Nick. Hammond's brief appearances were a delight to watch, and the character Roland Tembo is a bold, tactical hunter with an air of dignity and passion that earned my respect as an anti-heroic figure. It isn't really an environmental film so much as one about attaining compromise between two dangerous extremes, personified by Roland and Nick. Another theme is failure to treat what you create with responsibility, as seen with InGen's haughty regard for the dinosaurs as financial assets and not real animals, rather like Frankenstein's negligence towards his creation. Taking the dinosaurs to the mainland zoo would have been disastrous, as Crichton's underlying belief that humans and dinosaurs don't mix is still present. It's also worth remembering that this is a movie of dinosaurs in the wild so there will be higher danger than on the theme park island. I personally find it appealing that we can see the dinosaurs out in the wild simply being dinosaurs, especially the parental instincts of the T- Rexes. The dark, primordial atmosphere of Isla Sorna, accompanied by John Williams' excellent jungle-themed score, does instil a sense that you are in the midst of the dinosaurs' domain, with a few reprisals of the original themes. The CGI dinosaurs look better than most CG creatures today; their behaviour feels genuine, much like real animals, especially with the scenes involving a herd of Stegosaurus and the scenes with the T-Rexes. The animatronics are just as sharp and engaging as the first film, from a technical standpoint, it's well crafted. Ultimately, "The Lost World" is an enjoyable, if reckless, survival film that gives the incredible dinosaurs of InGen a visceral return. Spielberg's style holds it up as an advancement of the Jurassic Park universe. There are plenty of thrills, engrossing action scenes, and a dark and wild atmosphere that could have been helped by more moments of wonder. I certainly wouldn't call this Spielberg's worst movie. Despite being dwarfed by its grander predecessor, it's a fun movie, if flawed.

    (Reviewed on the basis of watching on video 16 years after release) Plot: Ian Malcolm learns about the existence of Site B, Isla Sorna which was the breeding place of all the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park and they are still flourishing there! John Hammond sends a team, headed by Malcolm to the island to gather more information where they encounter another team out to capture the animals. What dangers await them in this 'lost world'? Review: Steven Spielberg films, as I have learned, are meant to be lifelong experiences which curve out a permanent niche in the viewer's hearts. They take us on a journey of a life-time in a trivial period of 120 minutes. Although I am in no position to comment on Spielberg's filmography; having watched just two other masterpieces of the maestro: Jurassic Park and Jaws. But those two films were exactly that- lifetime experiences! Sadly, 'The Lost World' hardly falls in that category. Sequels always have the burden of expectations (especially if the original is a near-perfect classic like Jurassic Park); but one expected better than this. Spielberg himself had requested Michael Crichton to write his literary sequel on which this film sequel is based. It seemed inexplicable as to why the mesmerizing Allan Grant, hero of the original, was replaced by Ian Malcolm who hardly featured in the second half. Crichton possibly felt it unjustified as Malcolm had a more heroic role in his novel and decided to give him his due here (by even miraculously reviving him after his supposed death in the book). The film starts off well promising more thrills at the prospect of only a few people in a dinosaur infested island; with no fences this time. But after a rather tiring build-up, when the team reaches the island they witness the arrival of another team out to capture dinosaurs. Riding on armed vehicles (including motor bikes) they trap the animals almost as a matter of joke. Hunting a jackal would probably be more difficult! The ridiculous ease with which the animals are captured dilutes the whole tension of the film. Even when the animals break-free; the sequence appears more funny than terrifying. Even in JP the real tension had begun post-intermission; but the first half was much more engrossing than here. There the debates, the character interactions and the whole arrangement hooked our attention without much sight of the 'main attractions'. Here we are exposed to a wide range of fauna; but yet the charm is missing with only the Hammond- Malcolm interaction standing out as a debate. Things improve in the second half but unlike just a handful of people in JP; the presence of a large human contingent prevents the generation of much fear (especially having seen their daredevilry earlier). But halfway into the second half, just when the excitement is at its peak, the survivors are whisked away in a helicopter; killing all the tension in an instant. Although more fun was yet to come (thank God!), it was in stark contrast to JP where the excitement had continued to rise culminating in a grand crescendo in the end. The plot has a lot of deviations from the novel, and probably in doing so developed a lot of glaring loopholes. The sequel raises questions about some developments from the first film itself besides having disputes of its own:- 1) If the animals were bred in Site B; then why was the embryo storage located in Site A from where Dennis Nedry stole them? 2) Similarly, it was shown that the velociraptors were artificially hatched in the Site A lab. Was any exception made for not breeding raptors in Site B? Then how could the raptors come into existence there? 3) The lysine deficiency expectedly resulted in the death of all Site A animals. Yet why it didn't apply to Site B was one of the main questions for the team. But it remained unanswered throughout the film. Maybe the script-writer just forgot about it; for was it tough to imagine any explanation like maybe the endemic vegetation of the island was the reason behind it. 4) The justification given by Hammond as to raise public support by furnishing pictures is outrageous. Wouldn't the public be more eager to watch these animals in a zoo? 5) All carnivores were supposed to be in the middle of the island. But in the opening sequence, the compsognathus were seen roaming in herds near the beach. 6) There was no such accident in Site B, unlike Site A. Then why was the radio system along with a bunch of cars left to degrade in the island? 7) How did the T-Rex get trapped underneath the deck of the ship which was bringing it to US, after having killed all the crew above? But the film certainly has its moments. None better, than the tremendous rescue sequence resulting in the terribly tragic death of Eddie. It almost brought me to tears! Plus, the T-Rex chase, the raptor encounters and the ship-crash are the other highlights of the film. There is an element of King Kong in the climax which is good. But is it so easy to drive out a dinosaur within an hour or so? Also, a single dinosaur surrounded by infinite people spells much less fear than the reverse. Jeff Goldblum reprises Malcolm without the old mannerisms. He appears dapper (like a hero should); but the two previous T-Rex encounters have turned him sober from the 'rock-star' avatar, as was described by Hammond. There's hardly much character-interactions this time, except the touching father-daughter relationship. While Jurassic Park was an ultimate cinematic experience; The Lost World is just another good entertainer. But the ending, displaying the dinosaurs with Hammond's speech was masterful. All's well that end's well; but it's still not the end. The dinosaurs will be back; this time with my favorite Sam Neill as Allan Grant; in Jurassic Park III!

    The Lost World, the first sequel to 1993's Jurassic Park is an exhausting, thinly scripted film, that depends entirely on it's action sequences and special effects. Now that I've got the critique out of the way, let me just say that I had a blast watching The Lost World, the rare sequel that improves on the original. The Lost World may be missing some of the majesty and inventiveness of it's predecessor, but The Lost World is more fun, and the dinos are just as thrilling the second time around. 4 unfortunate souls make the dangerous decision to go to Isla Sorna to observe and document the dinosaurs living on the island. Among those five are Ian Malcolm, who had been to the island before, and had been nearly killed as a result of the reptilian beasts. He's hesitant to return, but his mind is made up when he discovers his girl friend, Sarah, is already at the island. And the plot thickens further when it's discovered that one of Ian's daughters, Kelly, manages to stow away to the treacherous place. And when the group discovers that a rival team of considerably more people have also shown up on the island (with more greedy plans in mind), it doesn't take long for the dinosaurs to show their faces. It hardly matters why these individuals have decided to come back to Jurassic Park. The plot is thin, so we're hardly given reasons for why this ill-fated group are choosing to set foot on the island. The obvious lack of story and the forced nature of this sequel is bothersome initially. But once the ball gets rolling, it's nothing but sheer entertainment value. Like the original, The Lost World has a painfully slow start. Obligatory appearances of cast members from the first film and some echoes of John Williams iconic score is all there is to entertain one during the first while. And an awful lot of talking. Seriously, for a film with so little plot, I'm not sure why so much time had to be spent in discussion. At any rate, the fun starts much sooner in this film. The pace picks up a bit about 40 minutes in, but right around the 50 minute mark, The Lost World fires all cylinders and doesn't look bad. Utterly terrifying and remarkably suspenseful, I had a big silly grin on my face for a majority of the action. Admittedly, The Lost World has a few gimmicks. For one, there are two Tyrannosaurs this time around. Twice the dinos means twice the fun, right? Well, not necessarily, but the added dinos were certainly welcome. Don't like being scared? This film isn't for you. Don't like seeing people in horrifying peril? This film isn't for you. Do you insist on some emotional depth or intellectual stimulation when you watch an action flick? Then once again, this film probably isn't for you. But if you kick back and relax, and just turn off your brain, this is one wild ride. Still, the run time is a bit excessive. The Lost World lasts 2 hours and 10 minutes, and I was left pretty exhausted after the first 100 minutes. So while the last half hour is perfectly thrilling, and still plenty of fun, it also felt a bit unnecessary, and a bit tacked on. The characters, like the original, aren't particularly developed. After all, they're not the main attraction here. But for the most part, they're likable when they need to be, and unlikeable when they need to be (though there are exceptions...). The acting is unimpressive, but serviceable. The actors only need to use some big words to describe the equipment they're using, and be able to show obvious signs of terror. As a result, the actors easily fit into their roles, though I couldn't help but hope for more impressive performances considering the talented players here; Jeff Goldblum, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, etc. Richard Attenborough brings plenty of charm to his character though, reprising his role as John Hammond from the original. Still, his part he is extremely small. The special effects has held up well. They look just as good as the ground breaking effects in the original (though they're not quite as innovative the second time around). With more dinosaurs this time around, and more complex action sequences, the special effects team likely had their hands full. It all looks great, though. John William's score, while lacking the iconic nature and grand scale of the original, is still good enough. It's certainly by-the-numbers Williams (and his new theme is completely forgettable), but it still manages to capture the spirit of the film. And fragments of the original themes do find their way into the film, so listen for them. This being my second visit to Jurassic Park, I knew what to expect. Lots of dinosaurs, moments of awe at the beginning, moments of terror everywhere after that, and stupid humans thinking they can control it all. I even made a few light-hearted attempts at guessing those who wouldn't live to see the end credits (I actually got most of my guesses right). But that may be the biggest issue for some; The Lost World doesn't do much to differentiate itself from the original. Still, considering how much fun the original was, that didn't bother me too much.

    Michael Crichton wrote a sequel to his bestselling book Jurassic Park with The Lost World Jurassic Park. Once again Crichton worked with Spielberg to put The Lost World on the big screen. Jeff Goldblum returns with a cast of interesting characters as he goes to a second island where the dinosaurs live free. There are no fences and you can only imagine what happens before you actually see it. I hate to compare the first to the second move but everybody knows I loved the first but not so much the second. Like Anaconda I lived it as a kid because the site of dinosaurs eating people was awesome, but now that I'm older I appreciate characters and relationships etc. What Jurassic Park had in story and characters lacked in The Lost World but The Lost World had the action and excitement that lacked in Jurassic Park. You may ask why Ian Malcolm would revisit the world of dinosaurs and the answer is quite simple. Hammond's company, InGen wants to go to the island and take an animal back to San Diego and put it in a zoo. Hammond sent Malcolm's girlfriend, who happens to be a paleontologist, to the island alone so Malcolm goes to rescue her. The characters and story could have been terrific. Eddie Carr was a great character, Vince Vaughn is in the movie and he gives a really good performance early in his career, and I especially loved the character of Roland. Roland is a hunter who is looking for the ultimate bounty. He is an important character that is underrated. His character could have been so much more and every time he was starting to be built up they cut to a dinosaur eating a smaller character. He was a character I wanted to know about. The movie should have focused on characters like him and the guy with the beard and long hair. He is a dinosaur genius and he has such little screen time. That is the huge flaw in the movie, it is focused too much on the dinosaurs eating people and not enough in the story and its characters. Ian Malcolm was one of the best characters in the 90s and in The Lost World he lost his edge. The snarky comments and brilliance he once had was nowhere to be seen. He had moments of brilliance but he was rewritten as a different character in a way. That was really the only thing that hurt the movie and made it worse than the original. Sequels aren't supposed to be better than the original but the actual dinosaurs and the action scenes were amazing. I could watch the trailer on the cliff scene with the T-Rex over and over again. The CGI and special effects put into the dinosaurs, along with the life size robots were astounding. What lacked in real character development was made up for in the work in the animals themselves. Each dinosaur had its scene to shine and there were a lot more different species. I love the stegosaurus and the Compys. They each had their scenes and some were better than the others but all great. The Compys were a big part of the first book and were not in the movie but I'm glad they found their way into the second one. They are real scavengers and make an impact in the movie. Spielberg and Crichton nail the raptors once again, possibly even better this time. It focused less on the intelligence and more on the ferocity of the animals this time. That could be better because if they focused on intelligence again it could be a little redundant. They appear a little late in the film but they really change it. They look a little different and I'm glad they weren't used simply for killing off all the extras. Then there is the final few scenes, and boy did they not disappoint. It was awesome but at the same time it kind of ruined the lore of Jurassic Park. A major part of the second island is that it is kept secret and nobody knows about it. Without spoiling the ending I'll just say the secret is out, and that's a shame. The book was a great read but after the first movie and how it played out, it only made sense that the book and movie were nothing alike. The really only similarity was the characters themselves and the animals in them. In my other reviews I mentioned the character Dogson and how hia character was ruined in the movies. In the second book he goes to the island and it wouldn't of made sense in this movie. There was only lost potential and another thing that hurt this movie. Overall, The Lost World Jurassic Park was one of my favorite movies when I was little. It still holds up today but still lacks in characters. The action and dinosaurs were fun to look at and were top notch for its time but it wasn't enough to be memorable. I went into this movie wanting more then what I got. I wish they sacrificed some of the action scenes for more character interactions, especially with Roland. There were few glimpses of brilliance but the lack of time spent on characters is the reason I give The Lost World Jurassic Park the WillyT Recommendation. It is a great movie that should be seen at least once. I can watch it every now and then but it isn't as memorable as I'd hoped. It is still a solid film and is a worthy sequel to the classic that was released a few years earlier.

    I hadn't saw The Lost World: Jurassic Park in theaters as I did the 1st installment JP. I still enjoyed the sequel, but maybe it was just as well I saw it on video. The storyline is a fuse of Aliens meets Godzilla. It's similarities to Aliens is pretty pronounced -- same "monster/alien versus man", with corporate profit-focused greedy entities and egos skewing decision-making to make innocent protagonist's lives even more miserable. And the ensuing drama plays out for our entertainment. Throw in the "we-are-surrounded, all-systems-are-down, and-we-must-survive-another-2-days before-the-rescue-team-arrives" clich&eacute; for good measure. The only thing missing is a face-hugger or chest-burst scene. I will give credit for some exciting nail-biter scenes. Some scenes however, are drawn out way too long, almost to a tortured length for suspense. It's never good when the scenes are so long you want to swear at the characters for being so klutzy, stupid or incompetent, and just get on with it already. The Jurassic Park series of movies are based on Michael Crichton's book, which is quite dark. I had a feeling Spielberg didn't know how to approach JP, in terms of the level of violence. It just seemed Spielberg wanted to make a kid-friendly movie with dinosaurs, with a little entertainment thrown in for fun. I'm sure it's a dilemma every director/studio must contend with: Do we have gratuitous violence in the movie, get an R-rating and make less box-office money? Or do we bastardize and water-down the book, leave out scenes entirely, and play up the kid-friendly nature of the violent story-line? It would seem Spielberg went with the latter. JP had a PG rating, which for many parents was an inappropriate rating for kids. Could you imagine Aliens with a PG rating? I won't open this can of worms here, but there is something to be said for how movies are rated, and whether there is politics and, of course, money involved. Me thinks this was the case for JP. Even the name of the movie was misleading to maximize movie goer attendance. How many times have you heard a mother ask her kids "Who wants to go to the park?!" Going to see "Jurassic Park" seemed so natural to take your kids, right?? TLW goes a little darker than JP. And appropriately, is designated a PG-13 rating. It would seem they were still struggling to make this dark story palatable for the widest audience possible. But let's face it, many scenes you will witness water running red with blood. Or human limbs being torn apart with big teeth. Not very far off from Aliensjust minus the chest-burster. I wasn't going to mention this, but it would be a shame NOT to mention it: In the movie, Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Ian Malcolm) has a black daughter. I think that statement is almost an internet meme now. There is no explanation for it, but casting like that does trigger some head-scratching. If there was a black couple that had an Asian daughter, it would be equally as curious -- you would want to know the background story. And judging from the amount of chatter about this topic, I would say casting like that does a disservice to the story line -- It only serves to distract. Case in point: I recall watching "The Matrix Reloaded" with an Asian friend. After the movie she mentioned there weren't enough Asians in the film. Let's be honest -- there were many Asians cast in TMR, but she argued there "weren't enough". Did she notice anything else about the movie? How about the lighting? The cinematography? The dialog and script writing? The editing? Character development? Nope. She was focused on counting the ratio of Asians, Indians, blacks and whites cast in each role. Oy. Near the end of TLW, Spielberg pays homage to Godzilla, replete with Japanese men running for their lives down a city street. My Asian friend would approve. As would VelociRaptors who were well represented throughout the film. The only group I could see complaining about the movie are the T-Rex, as I'm sure they are fed up being stereotyped and judged as blood-thirsty killers. Over and out.

    Let me just say that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park trilogy. This one was the first that I saw, and even now, I enjoy watching it. Sure, it's not as mind-blowing as Jurassic Park, but The Lost World is a great movie on it's own, even if there are some noticeable flaws. True, every scene is a setup for the next dinosaur attack, sure a velociraptor being knocked out by gymnastics is beyond stupid, and yeah, Sam Neill and Laura Dern are not in this movie, but there are a lot more positives concerning this movie than there are negatives. First of all, I'm glad Jeff Goldblum's character Ian Malcolm was given the lead, because this time around we really got to know him better and he was a lot more serious, mainly because he knows the dangers of facing these dinosaur, and what they're capable of, and Richard Attenborough's cameo as John Hammond was short, but quite a scene-stealing moment, and one of the most endearing moments from the entire film. The new actors(Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, etc) were good, and this is the only movie where I feel like Vince Vaughn showed how good of an actor he is. One complaint that is just stupid is that people complained that Jurassic Park didn't show enough dinosaurs, but when Spielberg showed more in The Lost World, they complained that it was too much. Now about the special effects, the dinosaurs look even better than they did in the first film, because it had been 4 years, and so obviously the effects would be upgraded, and I know people may disagree, but I really love the T-rex running through the streets of San Diego, and it just brings up the level of excitement. Malcolm's daughter is black, and she's kinda bratty, and I liked Lex and Tim (Hammond's grandchildren) better. They were more fun to watch, and their fear was more believable. Overall, The Lost World is a great movie for thrills and the acting is solid enough to keep you invested, but that doesn't change the fact that Jurassic Park was a better movie, told a better story, and had a much better balance in showing the Dinosaurs as creatures and monsters; while Jurassic Park took an hour to show a dinosaur attack, this movie did it almost immediately in the beginning of the film. Another disappointment is that the Velociraptors are less prominent this time around, but they're just as scary as they were in the first movie. But all in all, this movie is fun and thrilling, and the acting is really good, but it lacks the magic and inspiration that made Jurassic Park amazing. 8/10

    Steven Spielberg returned to direct this sequel,(loosely) based on the Michael Crichton novel that sees Jeff Goldblum returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who is enlisted by John Hammond(Richard Attenborough again) to return to Jurassic Park(though on previously unmentioned Site B) to study the dinosaur population, and also to rescue another team, which includes a former flame of his(played by Julianne Moore). He reluctantly agrees, and after locating her, finds to their disgust that the company INGEN has allowed hunting parties to take place, where big-game hunters(led by Pete Postlethwaite) stalk and kill dinosaurs, though the tables would of course be turned... Good sequel has equally effective F/X and terrifying story, though a few too many characters; the twist toward the end is surprising and entertaining, though some poor editing leaves a big plot hole aboard the discovered freighter...still, a worthy sequel that holds up today.

    The Lost World: Jurassic Park is one of the worst sequels ever when comparing it to the original. The characters are ugly, the story is stupid, the only good things are the things reused again, the effects and the score. When a group of scientist go pack for research, they are unaware of another group of people that have plans of their own that bring mayhem among the group and put more people then we would want in trouble. Now like before, they must get help to leave the island before they are the dinosaurs' dinner. This film brought back Jeff Goldblum, but he is nothing like his character in the first movie and is not good as well as Julianne Moore with the best being Vince Vaughn but he is also just eh. They are lifeless souls, waiting to be dinner and are not heroes but pain in the necks. The film's story is rather silly as the scientist roam free so the other people go hunting for a T-Rex as they want to bring one back to San Diego, but it escapes and starts to eat people there while already almost killing everyone at the park but maybe 5 people. Turns out the dinosaur was mad because it wanted its baby, but how did it know it would be hear? The two good things I can pick up from this movie are the effects and score. It was as good as the first, but it's not good enough to help the film. Spielberg has made only one movie that I completely dislike and that's a shame since it could have been good, but we can only hope that it will get better or stop here. Me: D+

    Considered one of Steven Spielberg's worst films, "Jurassic Park: The Lost World" is also considered to be the worst film in the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. While the film does fail with some aspects of the film, it also has its strengths and brings new ideas to the "Jurassic Park" franchise. "Jurassic Park" is one of the films that I see that does not need to have a main antagonist. There are some films I feel like that where it is done well like "Aliens" or "Platoon", but "The Lost World" does not do this. The main antagonist of Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) is a stereotypical businessman who has no idea of what to do. While John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) was like this in the first film, he was not a stereotype, let alone an antagonist. The only thing done right is that he is the opposite of Hammond, being in it for the money while Hammond was in it just to bring something new to people. With the main antagonist comes the problem with the main character, Ian Malcolm. I have no problem with Jeff Goldblum and I loved the character in both the novelizations of "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World" and the first film. This is still the case with this movie but I do not think that Malcolm is a good main character. In the first movie, he was more of a foil character to oppose Hammond instead of someone who was main character material. Also, he still seems to be the designated guy who brings the comic relief. While I was okay with that in the first film, he should not of been like that this much when he was a main character. There were a lot of things I liked, though, as well. The characters are still somewhat interesting as opposed to the blank slates they are in "Jurassic Park III". Plus, the dinosaurs are fleshed out a little as shown being caring parents and not just giant monsters. Along with the fleshing out of the dinosaurs, there is another aspect of the film that I like involving the dinosaurs. The herbivores are dangerous, like they would be in real life which is glossed over in the first and second film. Stegosaurus attack Sarah, a Pachycephalosaurus attacks the mercenaries cars, and the herbivores trash the mercenaries camp. Yes, it is more of a dinosaur attack film but it does show us more of how the animals really would be and not the simple herbivores are nice and safe while the carnivores are mean and dangerous like the other two films do. Taking the pros with the cons, I liked this film and found that it was a good addition to the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. The effects were good, the story was interesting, and the action was superb and tense. While there are some pretty big flaws with the characters, they do not hurt the film a lot.

    Not quite as good as the first one only because several of the first movie cast was not in it. Sam Neill, Laura Dern are two that come to mind. This is still an excellent movie. Jeff Golblum is back as Doctor Ian Malcolm and does his usual good job. His character is still insightful and more importantly he still gets some humorous lines as well. Julianne Moore plays a very tunnel vision doctor that is more interested in the animals than in her own survival, at least at times. One of the not so good guys that are also on this island if the hunter played by Pete Postlethwaite. He is there for the protection but his personal objective is to bag a big one. Well it turns out he gets bagged.

    The first thing to know about 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is that it's not as good as 'Jurassic Park', which is a very high standard to reach. As a young boy, I had reservations about this movie, but it's actually started to slowly grow on me more over time. People may find this strange because of the huge amount of hate towards this film, but I find there's still merit to be found. Story: After a family on a yacht cruise discovers Isla Sorna, the factory floor island owned by InGen, and their daughter is attacked by a pack of compies, John Hammond is removed as CEO of InGen by his greedy nephew Peter Ludlow. Hammond summons Ian Malcolm, now scarred by experiences in Jurassic Park, and asks him to lead an expedition to document the dinosaurs (at a distance from the carnivores) to earn the government's protection. After discovering his girlfriend, Sarah Harding, is already there, Malcolm joins Nick Van Owen and Eddie Carr and sails to the island. Ludlow arrives with a taskforce led by Roland Tembo capture the dinosaurs and take them to San Diego to flaunt them in a zoo. At night, Nick sabotages the InGen camp and brings an injured baby T-Rex to their trailer to patch it's leg up after Roland had captured to bait the father Rex. The T-Rex parents soon retrieve the infant and push the trailer over a cliff, and Eddie is killed trying to save Malcolm and team before InGen arrives to help them out. Both stranded teams concede to join forces to get off the island. The film culminates in a fun (if divisive) 15-minute sequence when the male T-Rex rampages through San Diego searching for his infant, paying homage to 'King Kong' and 1925's 'The Lost World'. One key problem most people have with "The Lost World" is that it's not as filled with wonder as the original, and this film certainly could have benefited from more scenes with the herbivores and characters enjoying the island ambiance. Judging by some unrealistic moments and plot holes, such as the way the trailer fell or the scene where Malcolm's daughter is able to defeat a Raptor with gymnastics, and the fact that the crew of the ship holding the Rex was killed with no clue as to how it happened, Spielberg was not fully committed to this film, which is a real shame. The build-up is also fairly slow, but can be skipped. Personally, the infamous gymnastic scene just makes me chuckle, it's not worth getting angry over. And I admit that I relished in the Rex's travels in San Diego and his reunion with the once-again captured infant. Another major criticism is that main characters cause more death and destruction than the InGen team, and that is partially true. Sarah cannot seem to keep away from dangerous dinosaurs in the field and can be annoying at times, but she still helps lead the T-Rex away from civilians in San Diego. However, Nick is just awful; he's a self- righteous environmentalist whose actions include releasing the captive dinosaurs on the InGen team and stealing the bullets from Roland's rifle to prevent the T-Rex from being killed, thus putting more people in danger. Frankly, I regard him as a hidden antagonist responsible for the chaos, thankfully he's absent from the San Diego sequence. Ultimately, the lack of defined heroes and villains feels more in keeping with the grimness of Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park novel, which was very cynical, and potentially disconcerting to certain people. In this movie's defence, some characters do stand out in a positive light; Ian Malcolm is just as eccentric and witty as ever if more cynical (Jeff Goldblum an acquired taste, really). Another worthy character is Eddie Carr, who is killed by the T-Rexes in the act of saving Malcolm, Sarah and Nick. Hammond's brief appearances were a delight to watch, and the character Roland Tembo is a bold, tactical hunter with an air of dignity and passion that earned my respect as an anti-heroic figure. It isn't really an environmental film so much as one about attaining compromise between two dangerous extremes, personified by Roland and Nick. Another theme is failure to treat what you create with responsibility, as seen with InGen's haughty regard for the dinosaurs as financial assets and not real animals, rather like Frankenstein's negligence towards his creation. Taking the dinosaurs to the mainland zoo would have been disastrous, as Crichton's underlying belief that humans and dinosaurs don't mix is still present. It's also worth remembering that this is a movie of dinosaurs in the wild so there will be higher danger than on the theme park island. I personally find it appealing that we can see the dinosaurs out in the wild simply being dinosaurs, especially the parental instincts of the T- Rexes. The dark, primordial atmosphere of Isla Sorna, accompanied by John Williams' excellent jungle-themed score, does instil a sense that you are in the midst of the dinosaurs' domain, with a few reprisals of the original themes. The CGI dinosaurs look better than most CG creatures today; their behaviour feels genuine, much like real animals, especially with the scenes involving a herd of Stegosaurus and the scenes with the T-Rexes. The animatronics are just as sharp and engaging as the first film, from a technical standpoint, it's well crafted. Ultimately, "The Lost World" is an enjoyable, if reckless, survival film that gives the incredible dinosaurs of InGen a visceral return. Spielberg's style holds it up as an advancement of the Jurassic Park universe. There are plenty of thrills, engrossing action scenes, and a dark and wild atmosphere that could have been helped by more moments of wonder. I certainly wouldn't call this Spielberg's worst movie. Despite being dwarfed by its grander predecessor, it's a fun movie, if flawed.

    (Reviewed on the basis of watching on video 16 years after release) Plot: Ian Malcolm learns about the existence of Site B, Isla Sorna which was the breeding place of all the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park and they are still flourishing there! John Hammond sends a team, headed by Malcolm to the island to gather more information where they encounter another team out to capture the animals. What dangers await them in this 'lost world'? Review: Steven Spielberg films, as I have learned, are meant to be lifelong experiences which curve out a permanent niche in the viewer's hearts. They take us on a journey of a life-time in a trivial period of 120 minutes. Although I am in no position to comment on Spielberg's filmography; having watched just two other masterpieces of the maestro: Jurassic Park and Jaws. But those two films were exactly that- lifetime experiences! Sadly, 'The Lost World' hardly falls in that category. Sequels always have the burden of expectations (especially if the original is a near-perfect classic like Jurassic Park); but one expected better than this. Spielberg himself had requested Michael Crichton to write his literary sequel on which this film sequel is based. It seemed inexplicable as to why the mesmerizing Allan Grant, hero of the original, was replaced by Ian Malcolm who hardly featured in the second half. Crichton possibly felt it unjustified as Malcolm had a more heroic role in his novel and decided to give him his due here (by even miraculously reviving him after his supposed death in the book). The film starts off well promising more thrills at the prospect of only a few people in a dinosaur infested island; with no fences this time. But after a rather tiring build-up, when the team reaches the island they witness the arrival of another team out to capture dinosaurs. Riding on armed vehicles (including motor bikes) they trap the animals almost as a matter of joke. Hunting a jackal would probably be more difficult! The ridiculous ease with which the animals are captured dilutes the whole tension of the film. Even when the animals break-free; the sequence appears more funny than terrifying. Even in JP the real tension had begun post-intermission; but the first half was much more engrossing than here. There the debates, the character interactions and the whole arrangement hooked our attention without much sight of the 'main attractions'. Here we are exposed to a wide range of fauna; but yet the charm is missing with only the Hammond- Malcolm interaction standing out as a debate. Things improve in the second half but unlike just a handful of people in JP; the presence of a large human contingent prevents the generation of much fear (especially having seen their daredevilry earlier). But halfway into the second half, just when the excitement is at its peak, the survivors are whisked away in a helicopter; killing all the tension in an instant. Although more fun was yet to come (thank God!), it was in stark contrast to JP where the excitement had continued to rise culminating in a grand crescendo in the end. The plot has a lot of deviations from the novel, and probably in doing so developed a lot of glaring loopholes. The sequel raises questions about some developments from the first film itself besides having disputes of its own:- 1) If the animals were bred in Site B; then why was the embryo storage located in Site A from where Dennis Nedry stole them? 2) Similarly, it was shown that the velociraptors were artificially hatched in the Site A lab. Was any exception made for not breeding raptors in Site B? Then how could the raptors come into existence there? 3) The lysine deficiency expectedly resulted in the death of all Site A animals. Yet why it didn't apply to Site B was one of the main questions for the team. But it remained unanswered throughout the film. Maybe the script-writer just forgot about it; for was it tough to imagine any explanation like maybe the endemic vegetation of the island was the reason behind it. 4) The justification given by Hammond as to raise public support by furnishing pictures is outrageous. Wouldn't the public be more eager to watch these animals in a zoo? 5) All carnivores were supposed to be in the middle of the island. But in the opening sequence, the compsognathus were seen roaming in herds near the beach. 6) There was no such accident in Site B, unlike Site A. Then why was the radio system along with a bunch of cars left to degrade in the island? 7) How did the T-Rex get trapped underneath the deck of the ship which was bringing it to US, after having killed all the crew above? But the film certainly has its moments. None better, than the tremendous rescue sequence resulting in the terribly tragic death of Eddie. It almost brought me to tears! Plus, the T-Rex chase, the raptor encounters and the ship-crash are the other highlights of the film. There is an element of King Kong in the climax which is good. But is it so easy to drive out a dinosaur within an hour or so? Also, a single dinosaur surrounded by infinite people spells much less fear than the reverse. Jeff Goldblum reprises Malcolm without the old mannerisms. He appears dapper (like a hero should); but the two previous T-Rex encounters have turned him sober from the 'rock-star' avatar, as was described by Hammond. There's hardly much character-interactions this time, except the touching father-daughter relationship. While Jurassic Park was an ultimate cinematic experience; The Lost World is just another good entertainer. But the ending, displaying the dinosaurs with Hammond's speech was masterful. All's well that end's well; but it's still not the end. The dinosaurs will be back; this time with my favorite Sam Neill as Allan Grant; in Jurassic Park III!

    The Lost World, the first sequel to 1993's Jurassic Park is an exhausting, thinly scripted film, that depends entirely on it's action sequences and special effects. Now that I've got the critique out of the way, let me just say that I had a blast watching The Lost World, the rare sequel that improves on the original. The Lost World may be missing some of the majesty and inventiveness of it's predecessor, but The Lost World is more fun, and the dinos are just as thrilling the second time around. 4 unfortunate souls make the dangerous decision to go to Isla Sorna to observe and document the dinosaurs living on the island. Among those five are Ian Malcolm, who had been to the island before, and had been nearly killed as a result of the reptilian beasts. He's hesitant to return, but his mind is made up when he discovers his girl friend, Sarah, is already at the island. And the plot thickens further when it's discovered that one of Ian's daughters, Kelly, manages to stow away to the treacherous place. And when the group discovers that a rival team of considerably more people have also shown up on the island (with more greedy plans in mind), it doesn't take long for the dinosaurs to show their faces. It hardly matters why these individuals have decided to come back to Jurassic Park. The plot is thin, so we're hardly given reasons for why this ill-fated group are choosing to set foot on the island. The obvious lack of story and the forced nature of this sequel is bothersome initially. But once the ball gets rolling, it's nothing but sheer entertainment value. Like the original, The Lost World has a painfully slow start. Obligatory appearances of cast members from the first film and some echoes of John Williams iconic score is all there is to entertain one during the first while. And an awful lot of talking. Seriously, for a film with so little plot, I'm not sure why so much time had to be spent in discussion. At any rate, the fun starts much sooner in this film. The pace picks up a bit about 40 minutes in, but right around the 50 minute mark, The Lost World fires all cylinders and doesn't look bad. Utterly terrifying and remarkably suspenseful, I had a big silly grin on my face for a majority of the action. Admittedly, The Lost World has a few gimmicks. For one, there are two Tyrannosaurs this time around. Twice the dinos means twice the fun, right? Well, not necessarily, but the added dinos were certainly welcome. Don't like being scared? This film isn't for you. Don't like seeing people in horrifying peril? This film isn't for you. Do you insist on some emotional depth or intellectual stimulation when you watch an action flick? Then once again, this film probably isn't for you. But if you kick back and relax, and just turn off your brain, this is one wild ride. Still, the run time is a bit excessive. The Lost World lasts 2 hours and 10 minutes, and I was left pretty exhausted after the first 100 minutes. So while the last half hour is perfectly thrilling, and still plenty of fun, it also felt a bit unnecessary, and a bit tacked on. The characters, like the original, aren't particularly developed. After all, they're not the main attraction here. But for the most part, they're likable when they need to be, and unlikeable when they need to be (though there are exceptions...). The acting is unimpressive, but serviceable. The actors only need to use some big words to describe the equipment they're using, and be able to show obvious signs of terror. As a result, the actors easily fit into their roles, though I couldn't help but hope for more impressive performances considering the talented players here; Jeff Goldblum, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, etc. Richard Attenborough brings plenty of charm to his character though, reprising his role as John Hammond from the original. Still, his part he is extremely small. The special effects has held up well. They look just as good as the ground breaking effects in the original (though they're not quite as innovative the second time around). With more dinosaurs this time around, and more complex action sequences, the special effects team likely had their hands full. It all looks great, though. John William's score, while lacking the iconic nature and grand scale of the original, is still good enough. It's certainly by-the-numbers Williams (and his new theme is completely forgettable), but it still manages to capture the spirit of the film. And fragments of the original themes do find their way into the film, so listen for them. This being my second visit to Jurassic Park, I knew what to expect. Lots of dinosaurs, moments of awe at the beginning, moments of terror everywhere after that, and stupid humans thinking they can control it all. I even made a few light-hearted attempts at guessing those who wouldn't live to see the end credits (I actually got most of my guesses right). But that may be the biggest issue for some; The Lost World doesn't do much to differentiate itself from the original. Still, considering how much fun the original was, that didn't bother me too much.

    Michael Crichton wrote a sequel to his bestselling book Jurassic Park with The Lost World Jurassic Park. Once again Crichton worked with Spielberg to put The Lost World on the big screen. Jeff Goldblum returns with a cast of interesting characters as he goes to a second island where the dinosaurs live free. There are no fences and you can only imagine what happens before you actually see it. I hate to compare the first to the second move but everybody knows I loved the first but not so much the second. Like Anaconda I lived it as a kid because the site of dinosaurs eating people was awesome, but now that I'm older I appreciate characters and relationships etc. What Jurassic Park had in story and characters lacked in The Lost World but The Lost World had the action and excitement that lacked in Jurassic Park. You may ask why Ian Malcolm would revisit the world of dinosaurs and the answer is quite simple. Hammond's company, InGen wants to go to the island and take an animal back to San Diego and put it in a zoo. Hammond sent Malcolm's girlfriend, who happens to be a paleontologist, to the island alone so Malcolm goes to rescue her. The characters and story could have been terrific. Eddie Carr was a great character, Vince Vaughn is in the movie and he gives a really good performance early in his career, and I especially loved the character of Roland. Roland is a hunter who is looking for the ultimate bounty. He is an important character that is underrated. His character could have been so much more and every time he was starting to be built up they cut to a dinosaur eating a smaller character. He was a character I wanted to know about. The movie should have focused on characters like him and the guy with the beard and long hair. He is a dinosaur genius and he has such little screen time. That is the huge flaw in the movie, it is focused too much on the dinosaurs eating people and not enough in the story and its characters. Ian Malcolm was one of the best characters in the 90s and in The Lost World he lost his edge. The snarky comments and brilliance he once had was nowhere to be seen. He had moments of brilliance but he was rewritten as a different character in a way. That was really the only thing that hurt the movie and made it worse than the original. Sequels aren't supposed to be better than the original but the actual dinosaurs and the action scenes were amazing. I could watch the trailer on the cliff scene with the T-Rex over and over again. The CGI and special effects put into the dinosaurs, along with the life size robots were astounding. What lacked in real character development was made up for in the work in the animals themselves. Each dinosaur had its scene to shine and there were a lot more different species. I love the stegosaurus and the Compys. They each had their scenes and some were better than the others but all great. The Compys were a big part of the first book and were not in the movie but I'm glad they found their way into the second one. They are real scavengers and make an impact in the movie. Spielberg and Crichton nail the raptors once again, possibly even better this time. It focused less on the intelligence and more on the ferocity of the animals this time. That could be better because if they focused on intelligence again it could be a little redundant. They appear a little late in the film but they really change it. They look a little different and I'm glad they weren't used simply for killing off all the extras. Then there is the final few scenes, and boy did they not disappoint. It was awesome but at the same time it kind of ruined the lore of Jurassic Park. A major part of the second island is that it is kept secret and nobody knows about it. Without spoiling the ending I'll just say the secret is out, and that's a shame. The book was a great read but after the first movie and how it played out, it only made sense that the book and movie were nothing alike. The really only similarity was the characters themselves and the animals in them. In my other reviews I mentioned the character Dogson and how hia character was ruined in the movies. In the second book he goes to the island and it wouldn't of made sense in this movie. There was only lost potential and another thing that hurt this movie. Overall, The Lost World Jurassic Park was one of my favorite movies when I was little. It still holds up today but still lacks in characters. The action and dinosaurs were fun to look at and were top notch for its time but it wasn't enough to be memorable. I went into this movie wanting more then what I got. I wish they sacrificed some of the action scenes for more character interactions, especially with Roland. There were few glimpses of brilliance but the lack of time spent on characters is the reason I give The Lost World Jurassic Park the WillyT Recommendation. It is a great movie that should be seen at least once. I can watch it every now and then but it isn't as memorable as I'd hoped. It is still a solid film and is a worthy sequel to the classic that was released a few years earlier.

    I hadn't saw The Lost World: Jurassic Park in theaters as I did the 1st installment JP. I still enjoyed the sequel, but maybe it was just as well I saw it on video. The storyline is a fuse of Aliens meets Godzilla. It's similarities to Aliens is pretty pronounced -- same "monster/alien versus man", with corporate profit-focused greedy entities and egos skewing decision-making to make innocent protagonist's lives even more miserable. And the ensuing drama plays out for our entertainment. Throw in the "we-are-surrounded, all-systems-are-down, and-we-must-survive-another-2-days before-the-rescue-team-arrives" clich&eacute; for good measure. The only thing missing is a face-hugger or chest-burst scene. I will give credit for some exciting nail-biter scenes. Some scenes however, are drawn out way too long, almost to a tortured length for suspense. It's never good when the scenes are so long you want to swear at the characters for being so klutzy, stupid or incompetent, and just get on with it already. The Jurassic Park series of movies are based on Michael Crichton's book, which is quite dark. I had a feeling Spielberg didn't know how to approach JP, in terms of the level of violence. It just seemed Spielberg wanted to make a kid-friendly movie with dinosaurs, with a little entertainment thrown in for fun. I'm sure it's a dilemma every director/studio must contend with: Do we have gratuitous violence in the movie, get an R-rating and make less box-office money? Or do we bastardize and water-down the book, leave out scenes entirely, and play up the kid-friendly nature of the violent story-line? It would seem Spielberg went with the latter. JP had a PG rating, which for many parents was an inappropriate rating for kids. Could you imagine Aliens with a PG rating? I won't open this can of worms here, but there is something to be said for how movies are rated, and whether there is politics and, of course, money involved. Me thinks this was the case for JP. Even the name of the movie was misleading to maximize movie goer attendance. How many times have you heard a mother ask her kids "Who wants to go to the park?!" Going to see "Jurassic Park" seemed so natural to take your kids, right?? TLW goes a little darker than JP. And appropriately, is designated a PG-13 rating. It would seem they were still struggling to make this dark story palatable for the widest audience possible. But let's face it, many scenes you will witness water running red with blood. Or human limbs being torn apart with big teeth. Not very far off from Aliensjust minus the chest-burster. I wasn't going to mention this, but it would be a shame NOT to mention it: In the movie, Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Ian Malcolm) has a black daughter. I think that statement is almost an internet meme now. There is no explanation for it, but casting like that does trigger some head-scratching. If there was a black couple that had an Asian daughter, it would be equally as curious -- you would want to know the background story. And judging from the amount of chatter about this topic, I would say casting like that does a disservice to the story line -- It only serves to distract. Case in point: I recall watching "The Matrix Reloaded" with an Asian friend. After the movie she mentioned there weren't enough Asians in the film. Let's be honest -- there were many Asians cast in TMR, but she argued there "weren't enough". Did she notice anything else about the movie? How about the lighting? The cinematography? The dialog and script writing? The editing? Character development? Nope. She was focused on counting the ratio of Asians, Indians, blacks and whites cast in each role. Oy. Near the end of TLW, Spielberg pays homage to Godzilla, replete with Japanese men running for their lives down a city street. My Asian friend would approve. As would VelociRaptors who were well represented throughout the film. The only group I could see complaining about the movie are the T-Rex, as I'm sure they are fed up being stereotyped and judged as blood-thirsty killers. Over and out.

    Let me just say that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park trilogy. This one was the first that I saw, and even now, I enjoy watching it. Sure, it's not as mind-blowing as Jurassic Park, but The Lost World is a great movie on it's own, even if there are some noticeable flaws. True, every scene is a setup for the next dinosaur attack, sure a velociraptor being knocked out by gymnastics is beyond stupid, and yeah, Sam Neill and Laura Dern are not in this movie, but there are a lot more positives concerning this movie than there are negatives. First of all, I'm glad Jeff Goldblum's character Ian Malcolm was given the lead, because this time around we really got to know him better and he was a lot more serious, mainly because he knows the dangers of facing these dinosaur, and what they're capable of, and Richard Attenborough's cameo as John Hammond was short, but quite a scene-stealing moment, and one of the most endearing moments from the entire film. The new actors(Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, etc) were good, and this is the only movie where I feel like Vince Vaughn showed how good of an actor he is. One complaint that is just stupid is that people complained that Jurassic Park didn't show enough dinosaurs, but when Spielberg showed more in The Lost World, they complained that it was too much. Now about the special effects, the dinosaurs look even better than they did in the first film, because it had been 4 years, and so obviously the effects would be upgraded, and I know people may disagree, but I really love the T-rex running through the streets of San Diego, and it just brings up the level of excitement. Malcolm's daughter is black, and she's kinda bratty, and I liked Lex and Tim (Hammond's grandchildren) better. They were more fun to watch, and their fear was more believable. Overall, The Lost World is a great movie for thrills and the acting is solid enough to keep you invested, but that doesn't change the fact that Jurassic Park was a better movie, told a better story, and had a much better balance in showing the Dinosaurs as creatures and monsters; while Jurassic Park took an hour to show a dinosaur attack, this movie did it almost immediately in the beginning of the film. Another disappointment is that the Velociraptors are less prominent this time around, but they're just as scary as they were in the first movie. But all in all, this movie is fun and thrilling, and the acting is really good, but it lacks the magic and inspiration that made Jurassic Park amazing. 8/10

    Steven Spielberg returned to direct this sequel,(loosely) based on the Michael Crichton novel that sees Jeff Goldblum returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who is enlisted by John Hammond(Richard Attenborough again) to return to Jurassic Park(though on previously unmentioned Site B) to study the dinosaur population, and also to rescue another team, which includes a former flame of his(played by Julianne Moore). He reluctantly agrees, and after locating her, finds to their disgust that the company INGEN has allowed hunting parties to take place, where big-game hunters(led by Pete Postlethwaite) stalk and kill dinosaurs, though the tables would of course be turned... Good sequel has equally effective F/X and terrifying story, though a few too many characters; the twist toward the end is surprising and entertaining, though some poor editing leaves a big plot hole aboard the discovered freighter...still, a worthy sequel that holds up today.

    The Lost World: Jurassic Park is one of the worst sequels ever when comparing it to the original. The characters are ugly, the story is stupid, the only good things are the things reused again, the effects and the score. When a group of scientist go pack for research, they are unaware of another group of people that have plans of their own that bring mayhem among the group and put more people then we would want in trouble. Now like before, they must get help to leave the island before they are the dinosaurs' dinner. This film brought back Jeff Goldblum, but he is nothing like his character in the first movie and is not good as well as Julianne Moore with the best being Vince Vaughn but he is also just eh. They are lifeless souls, waiting to be dinner and are not heroes but pain in the necks. The film's story is rather silly as the scientist roam free so the other people go hunting for a T-Rex as they want to bring one back to San Diego, but it escapes and starts to eat people there while already almost killing everyone at the park but maybe 5 people. Turns out the dinosaur was mad because it wanted its baby, but how did it know it would be hear? The two good things I can pick up from this movie are the effects and score. It was as good as the first, but it's not good enough to help the film. Spielberg has made only one movie that I completely dislike and that's a shame since it could have been good, but we can only hope that it will get better or stop here. Me: D+

    Considered one of Steven Spielberg's worst films, "Jurassic Park: The Lost World" is also considered to be the worst film in the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. While the film does fail with some aspects of the film, it also has its strengths and brings new ideas to the "Jurassic Park" franchise. "Jurassic Park" is one of the films that I see that does not need to have a main antagonist. There are some films I feel like that where it is done well like "Aliens" or "Platoon", but "The Lost World" does not do this. The main antagonist of Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) is a stereotypical businessman who has no idea of what to do. While John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) was like this in the first film, he was not a stereotype, let alone an antagonist. The only thing done right is that he is the opposite of Hammond, being in it for the money while Hammond was in it just to bring something new to people. With the main antagonist comes the problem with the main character, Ian Malcolm. I have no problem with Jeff Goldblum and I loved the character in both the novelizations of "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World" and the first film. This is still the case with this movie but I do not think that Malcolm is a good main character. In the first movie, he was more of a foil character to oppose Hammond instead of someone who was main character material. Also, he still seems to be the designated guy who brings the comic relief. While I was okay with that in the first film, he should not of been like that this much when he was a main character. There were a lot of things I liked, though, as well. The characters are still somewhat interesting as opposed to the blank slates they are in "Jurassic Park III". Plus, the dinosaurs are fleshed out a little as shown being caring parents and not just giant monsters. Along with the fleshing out of the dinosaurs, there is another aspect of the film that I like involving the dinosaurs. The herbivores are dangerous, like they would be in real life which is glossed over in the first and second film. Stegosaurus attack Sarah, a Pachycephalosaurus attacks the mercenaries cars, and the herbivores trash the mercenaries camp. Yes, it is more of a dinosaur attack film but it does show us more of how the animals really would be and not the simple herbivores are nice and safe while the carnivores are mean and dangerous like the other two films do. Taking the pros with the cons, I liked this film and found that it was a good addition to the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. The effects were good, the story was interesting, and the action was superb and tense. While there are some pretty big flaws with the characters, they do not hurt the film a lot.

    Not quite as good as the first one only because several of the first movie cast was not in it. Sam Neill, Laura Dern are two that come to mind. This is still an excellent movie. Jeff Golblum is back as Doctor Ian Malcolm and does his usual good job. His character is still insightful and more importantly he still gets some humorous lines as well. Julianne Moore plays a very tunnel vision doctor that is more interested in the animals than in her own survival, at least at times. One of the not so good guys that are also on this island if the hunter played by Pete Postlethwaite. He is there for the protection but his personal objective is to bag a big one. Well it turns out he gets bagged.

    The first thing to know about 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is that it's not as good as 'Jurassic Park', which is a very high standard to reach. As a young boy, I had reservations about this movie, but it's actually started to slowly grow on me more over time. People may find this strange because of the huge amount of hate towards this film, but I find there's still merit to be found. Story: After a family on a yacht cruise discovers Isla Sorna, the factory floor island owned by InGen, and their daughter is attacked by a pack of compies, John Hammond is removed as CEO of InGen by his greedy nephew Peter Ludlow. Hammond summons Ian Malcolm, now scarred by experiences in Jurassic Park, and asks him to lead an expedition to document the dinosaurs (at a distance from the carnivores) to earn the government's protection. After discovering his girlfriend, Sarah Harding, is already there, Malcolm joins Nick Van Owen and Eddie Carr and sails to the island. Ludlow arrives with a taskforce led by Roland Tembo capture the dinosaurs and take them to San Diego to flaunt them in a zoo. At night, Nick sabotages the InGen camp and brings an injured baby T-Rex to their trailer to patch it's leg up after Roland had captured to bait the father Rex. The T-Rex parents soon retrieve the infant and push the trailer over a cliff, and Eddie is killed trying to save Malcolm and team before InGen arrives to help them out. Both stranded teams concede to join forces to get off the island. The film culminates in a fun (if divisive) 15-minute sequence when the male T-Rex rampages through San Diego searching for his infant, paying homage to 'King Kong' and 1925's 'The Lost World'. One key problem most people have with "The Lost World" is that it's not as filled with wonder as the original, and this film certainly could have benefited from more scenes with the herbivores and characters enjoying the island ambiance. Judging by some unrealistic moments and plot holes, such as the way the trailer fell or the scene where Malcolm's daughter is able to defeat a Raptor with gymnastics, and the fact that the crew of the ship holding the Rex was killed with no clue as to how it happened, Spielberg was not fully committed to this film, which is a real shame. The build-up is also fairly slow, but can be skipped. Personally, the infamous gymnastic scene just makes me chuckle, it's not worth getting angry over. And I admit that I relished in the Rex's travels in San Diego and his reunion with the once-again captured infant. Another major criticism is that main characters cause more death and destruction than the InGen team, and that is partially true. Sarah cannot seem to keep away from dangerous dinosaurs in the field and can be annoying at times, but she still helps lead the T-Rex away from civilians in San Diego. However, Nick is just awful; he's a self- righteous environmentalist whose actions include releasing the captive dinosaurs on the InGen team and stealing the bullets from Roland's rifle to prevent the T-Rex from being killed, thus putting more people in danger. Frankly, I regard him as a hidden antagonist responsible for the chaos, thankfully he's absent from the San Diego sequence. Ultimately, the lack of defined heroes and villains feels more in keeping with the grimness of Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park novel, which was very cynical, and potentially disconcerting to certain people. In this movie's defence, some characters do stand out in a positive light; Ian Malcolm is just as eccentric and witty as ever if more cynical (Jeff Goldblum an acquired taste, really). Another worthy character is Eddie Carr, who is killed by the T-Rexes in the act of saving Malcolm, Sarah and Nick. Hammond's brief appearances were a delight to watch, and the character Roland Tembo is a bold, tactical hunter with an air of dignity and passion that earned my respect as an anti-heroic figure. It isn't really an environmental film so much as one about attaining compromise between two dangerous extremes, personified by Roland and Nick. Another theme is failure to treat what you create with responsibility, as seen with InGen's haughty regard for the dinosaurs as financial assets and not real animals, rather like Frankenstein's negligence towards his creation. Taking the dinosaurs to the mainland zoo would have been disastrous, as Crichton's underlying belief that humans and dinosaurs don't mix is still present. It's also worth remembering that this is a movie of dinosaurs in the wild so there will be higher danger than on the theme park island. I personally find it appealing that we can see the dinosaurs out in the wild simply being dinosaurs, especially the parental instincts of the T- Rexes. The dark, primordial atmosphere of Isla Sorna, accompanied by John Williams' excellent jungle-themed score, does instil a sense that you are in the midst of the dinosaurs' domain, with a few reprisals of the original themes. The CGI dinosaurs look better than most CG creatures today; their behaviour feels genuine, much like real animals, especially with the scenes involving a herd of Stegosaurus and the scenes with the T-Rexes. The animatronics are just as sharp and engaging as the first film, from a technical standpoint, it's well crafted. Ultimately, "The Lost World" is an enjoyable, if reckless, survival film that gives the incredible dinosaurs of InGen a visceral return. Spielberg's style holds it up as an advancement of the Jurassic Park universe. There are plenty of thrills, engrossing action scenes, and a dark and wild atmosphere that could have been helped by more moments of wonder. I certainly wouldn't call this Spielberg's worst movie. Despite being dwarfed by its grander predecessor, it's a fun movie, if flawed.

    (Reviewed on the basis of watching on video 16 years after release) Plot: Ian Malcolm learns about the existence of Site B, Isla Sorna which was the breeding place of all the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park and they are still flourishing there! John Hammond sends a team, headed by Malcolm to the island to gather more information where they encounter another team out to capture the animals. What dangers await them in this 'lost world'? Review: Steven Spielberg films, as I have learned, are meant to be lifelong experiences which curve out a permanent niche in the viewer's hearts. They take us on a journey of a life-time in a trivial period of 120 minutes. Although I am in no position to comment on Spielberg's filmography; having watched just two other masterpieces of the maestro: Jurassic Park and Jaws. But those two films were exactly that- lifetime experiences! Sadly, 'The Lost World' hardly falls in that category. Sequels always have the burden of expectations (especially if the original is a near-perfect classic like Jurassic Park); but one expected better than this. Spielberg himself had requested Michael Crichton to write his literary sequel on which this film sequel is based. It seemed inexplicable as to why the mesmerizing Allan Grant, hero of the original, was replaced by Ian Malcolm who hardly featured in the second half. Crichton possibly felt it unjustified as Malcolm had a more heroic role in his novel and decided to give him his due here (by even miraculously reviving him after his supposed death in the book). The film starts off well promising more thrills at the prospect of only a few people in a dinosaur infested island; with no fences this time. But after a rather tiring build-up, when the team reaches the island they witness the arrival of another team out to capture dinosaurs. Riding on armed vehicles (including motor bikes) they trap the animals almost as a matter of joke. Hunting a jackal would probably be more difficult! The ridiculous ease with which the animals are captured dilutes the whole tension of the film. Even when the animals break-free; the sequence appears more funny than terrifying. Even in JP the real tension had begun post-intermission; but the first half was much more engrossing than here. There the debates, the character interactions and the whole arrangement hooked our attention without much sight of the 'main attractions'. Here we are exposed to a wide range of fauna; but yet the charm is missing with only the Hammond- Malcolm interaction standing out as a debate. Things improve in the second half but unlike just a handful of people in JP; the presence of a large human contingent prevents the generation of much fear (especially having seen their daredevilry earlier). But halfway into the second half, just when the excitement is at its peak, the survivors are whisked away in a helicopter; killing all the tension in an instant. Although more fun was yet to come (thank God!), it was in stark contrast to JP where the excitement had continued to rise culminating in a grand crescendo in the end. The plot has a lot of deviations from the novel, and probably in doing so developed a lot of glaring loopholes. The sequel raises questions about some developments from the first film itself besides having disputes of its own:- 1) If the animals were bred in Site B; then why was the embryo storage located in Site A from where Dennis Nedry stole them? 2) Similarly, it was shown that the velociraptors were artificially hatched in the Site A lab. Was any exception made for not breeding raptors in Site B? Then how could the raptors come into existence there? 3) The lysine deficiency expectedly resulted in the death of all Site A animals. Yet why it didn't apply to Site B was one of the main questions for the team. But it remained unanswered throughout the film. Maybe the script-writer just forgot about it; for was it tough to imagine any explanation like maybe the endemic vegetation of the island was the reason behind it. 4) The justification given by Hammond as to raise public support by furnishing pictures is outrageous. Wouldn't the public be more eager to watch these animals in a zoo? 5) All carnivores were supposed to be in the middle of the island. But in the opening sequence, the compsognathus were seen roaming in herds near the beach. 6) There was no such accident in Site B, unlike Site A. Then why was the radio system along with a bunch of cars left to degrade in the island? 7) How did the T-Rex get trapped underneath the deck of the ship which was bringing it to US, after having killed all the crew above? But the film certainly has its moments. None better, than the tremendous rescue sequence resulting in the terribly tragic death of Eddie. It almost brought me to tears! Plus, the T-Rex chase, the raptor encounters and the ship-crash are the other highlights of the film. There is an element of King Kong in the climax which is good. But is it so easy to drive out a dinosaur within an hour or so? Also, a single dinosaur surrounded by infinite people spells much less fear than the reverse. Jeff Goldblum reprises Malcolm without the old mannerisms. He appears dapper (like a hero should); but the two previous T-Rex encounters have turned him sober from the 'rock-star' avatar, as was described by Hammond. There's hardly much character-interactions this time, except the touching father-daughter relationship. While Jurassic Park was an ultimate cinematic experience; The Lost World is just another good entertainer. But the ending, displaying the dinosaurs with Hammond's speech was masterful. All's well that end's well; but it's still not the end. The dinosaurs will be back; this time with my favorite Sam Neill as Allan Grant; in Jurassic Park III!

    The Lost World, the first sequel to 1993's Jurassic Park is an exhausting, thinly scripted film, that depends entirely on it's action sequences and special effects. Now that I've got the critique out of the way, let me just say that I had a blast watching The Lost World, the rare sequel that improves on the original. The Lost World may be missing some of the majesty and inventiveness of it's predecessor, but The Lost World is more fun, and the dinos are just as thrilling the second time around. 4 unfortunate souls make the dangerous decision to go to Isla Sorna to observe and document the dinosaurs living on the island. Among those five are Ian Malcolm, who had been to the island before, and had been nearly killed as a result of the reptilian beasts. He's hesitant to return, but his mind is made up when he discovers his girl friend, Sarah, is already at the island. And the plot thickens further when it's discovered that one of Ian's daughters, Kelly, manages to stow away to the treacherous place. And when the group discovers that a rival team of considerably more people have also shown up on the island (with more greedy plans in mind), it doesn't take long for the dinosaurs to show their faces. It hardly matters why these individuals have decided to come back to Jurassic Park. The plot is thin, so we're hardly given reasons for why this ill-fated group are choosing to set foot on the island. The obvious lack of story and the forced nature of this sequel is bothersome initially. But once the ball gets rolling, it's nothing but sheer entertainment value. Like the original, The Lost World has a painfully slow start. Obligatory appearances of cast members from the first film and some echoes of John Williams iconic score is all there is to entertain one during the first while. And an awful lot of talking. Seriously, for a film with so little plot, I'm not sure why so much time had to be spent in discussion. At any rate, the fun starts much sooner in this film. The pace picks up a bit about 40 minutes in, but right around the 50 minute mark, The Lost World fires all cylinders and doesn't look bad. Utterly terrifying and remarkably suspenseful, I had a big silly grin on my face for a majority of the action. Admittedly, The Lost World has a few gimmicks. For one, there are two Tyrannosaurs this time around. Twice the dinos means twice the fun, right? Well, not necessarily, but the added dinos were certainly welcome. Don't like being scared? This film isn't for you. Don't like seeing people in horrifying peril? This film isn't for you. Do you insist on some emotional depth or intellectual stimulation when you watch an action flick? Then once again, this film probably isn't for you. But if you kick back and relax, and just turn off your brain, this is one wild ride. Still, the run time is a bit excessive. The Lost World lasts 2 hours and 10 minutes, and I was left pretty exhausted after the first 100 minutes. So while the last half hour is perfectly thrilling, and still plenty of fun, it also felt a bit unnecessary, and a bit tacked on. The characters, like the original, aren't particularly developed. After all, they're not the main attraction here. But for the most part, they're likable when they need to be, and unlikeable when they need to be (though there are exceptions...). The acting is unimpressive, but serviceable. The actors only need to use some big words to describe the equipment they're using, and be able to show obvious signs of terror. As a result, the actors easily fit into their roles, though I couldn't help but hope for more impressive performances considering the talented players here; Jeff Goldblum, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, etc. Richard Attenborough brings plenty of charm to his character though, reprising his role as John Hammond from the original. Still, his part he is extremely small. The special effects has held up well. They look just as good as the ground breaking effects in the original (though they're not quite as innovative the second time around). With more dinosaurs this time around, and more complex action sequences, the special effects team likely had their hands full. It all looks great, though. John William's score, while lacking the iconic nature and grand scale of the original, is still good enough. It's certainly by-the-numbers Williams (and his new theme is completely forgettable), but it still manages to capture the spirit of the film. And fragments of the original themes do find their way into the film, so listen for them. This being my second visit to Jurassic Park, I knew what to expect. Lots of dinosaurs, moments of awe at the beginning, moments of terror everywhere after that, and stupid humans thinking they can control it all. I even made a few light-hearted attempts at guessing those who wouldn't live to see the end credits (I actually got most of my guesses right). But that may be the biggest issue for some; The Lost World doesn't do much to differentiate itself from the original. Still, considering how much fun the original was, that didn't bother me too much.

    Michael Crichton wrote a sequel to his bestselling book Jurassic Park with The Lost World Jurassic Park. Once again Crichton worked with Spielberg to put The Lost World on the big screen. Jeff Goldblum returns with a cast of interesting characters as he goes to a second island where the dinosaurs live free. There are no fences and you can only imagine what happens before you actually see it. I hate to compare the first to the second move but everybody knows I loved the first but not so much the second. Like Anaconda I lived it as a kid because the site of dinosaurs eating people was awesome, but now that I'm older I appreciate characters and relationships etc. What Jurassic Park had in story and characters lacked in The Lost World but The Lost World had the action and excitement that lacked in Jurassic Park. You may ask why Ian Malcolm would revisit the world of dinosaurs and the answer is quite simple. Hammond's company, InGen wants to go to the island and take an animal back to San Diego and put it in a zoo. Hammond sent Malcolm's girlfriend, who happens to be a paleontologist, to the island alone so Malcolm goes to rescue her. The characters and story could have been terrific. Eddie Carr was a great character, Vince Vaughn is in the movie and he gives a really good performance early in his career, and I especially loved the character of Roland. Roland is a hunter who is looking for the ultimate bounty. He is an important character that is underrated. His character could have been so much more and every time he was starting to be built up they cut to a dinosaur eating a smaller character. He was a character I wanted to know about. The movie should have focused on characters like him and the guy with the beard and long hair. He is a dinosaur genius and he has such little screen time. That is the huge flaw in the movie, it is focused too much on the dinosaurs eating people and not enough in the story and its characters. Ian Malcolm was one of the best characters in the 90s and in The Lost World he lost his edge. The snarky comments and brilliance he once had was nowhere to be seen. He had moments of brilliance but he was rewritten as a different character in a way. That was really the only thing that hurt the movie and made it worse than the original. Sequels aren't supposed to be better than the original but the actual dinosaurs and the action scenes were amazing. I could watch the trailer on the cliff scene with the T-Rex over and over again. The CGI and special effects put into the dinosaurs, along with the life size robots were astounding. What lacked in real character development was made up for in the work in the animals themselves. Each dinosaur had its scene to shine and there were a lot more different species. I love the stegosaurus and the Compys. They each had their scenes and some were better than the others but all great. The Compys were a big part of the first book and were not in the movie but I'm glad they found their way into the second one. They are real scavengers and make an impact in the movie. Spielberg and Crichton nail the raptors once again, possibly even better this time. It focused less on the intelligence and more on the ferocity of the animals this time. That could be better because if they focused on intelligence again it could be a little redundant. They appear a little late in the film but they really change it. They look a little different and I'm glad they weren't used simply for killing off all the extras. Then there is the final few scenes, and boy did they not disappoint. It was awesome but at the same time it kind of ruined the lore of Jurassic Park. A major part of the second island is that it is kept secret and nobody knows about it. Without spoiling the ending I'll just say the secret is out, and that's a shame. The book was a great read but after the first movie and how it played out, it only made sense that the book and movie were nothing alike. The really only similarity was the characters themselves and the animals in them. In my other reviews I mentioned the character Dogson and how hia character was ruined in the movies. In the second book he goes to the island and it wouldn't of made sense in this movie. There was only lost potential and another thing that hurt this movie. Overall, The Lost World Jurassic Park was one of my favorite movies when I was little. It still holds up today but still lacks in characters. The action and dinosaurs were fun to look at and were top notch for its time but it wasn't enough to be memorable. I went into this movie wanting more then what I got. I wish they sacrificed some of the action scenes for more character interactions, especially with Roland. There were few glimpses of brilliance but the lack of time spent on characters is the reason I give The Lost World Jurassic Park the WillyT Recommendation. It is a great movie that should be seen at least once. I can watch it every now and then but it isn't as memorable as I'd hoped. It is still a solid film and is a worthy sequel to the classic that was released a few years earlier.

    I hadn't saw The Lost World: Jurassic Park in theaters as I did the 1st installment JP. I still enjoyed the sequel, but maybe it was just as well I saw it on video. The storyline is a fuse of Aliens meets Godzilla. It's similarities to Aliens is pretty pronounced -- same "monster/alien versus man", with corporate profit-focused greedy entities and egos skewing decision-making to make innocent protagonist's lives even more miserable. And the ensuing drama plays out for our entertainment. Throw in the "we-are-surrounded, all-systems-are-down, and-we-must-survive-another-2-days before-the-rescue-team-arrives" clich&eacute; for good measure. The only thing missing is a face-hugger or chest-burst scene. I will give credit for some exciting nail-biter scenes. Some scenes however, are drawn out way too long, almost to a tortured length for suspense. It's never good when the scenes are so long you want to swear at the characters for being so klutzy, stupid or incompetent, and just get on with it already. The Jurassic Park series of movies are based on Michael Crichton's book, which is quite dark. I had a feeling Spielberg didn't know how to approach JP, in terms of the level of violence. It just seemed Spielberg wanted to make a kid-friendly movie with dinosaurs, with a little entertainment thrown in for fun. I'm sure it's a dilemma every director/studio must contend with: Do we have gratuitous violence in the movie, get an R-rating and make less box-office money? Or do we bastardize and water-down the book, leave out scenes entirely, and play up the kid-friendly nature of the violent story-line? It would seem Spielberg went with the latter. JP had a PG rating, which for many parents was an inappropriate rating for kids. Could you imagine Aliens with a PG rating? I won't open this can of worms here, but there is something to be said for how movies are rated, and whether there is politics and, of course, money involved. Me thinks this was the case for JP. Even the name of the movie was misleading to maximize movie goer attendance. How many times have you heard a mother ask her kids "Who wants to go to the park?!" Going to see "Jurassic Park" seemed so natural to take your kids, right?? TLW goes a little darker than JP. And appropriately, is designated a PG-13 rating. It would seem they were still struggling to make this dark story palatable for the widest audience possible. But let's face it, many scenes you will witness water running red with blood. Or human limbs being torn apart with big teeth. Not very far off from Aliensjust minus the chest-burster. I wasn't going to mention this, but it would be a shame NOT to mention it: In the movie, Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Ian Malcolm) has a black daughter. I think that statement is almost an internet meme now. There is no explanation for it, but casting like that does trigger some head-scratching. If there was a black couple that had an Asian daughter, it would be equally as curious -- you would want to know the background story. And judging from the amount of chatter about this topic, I would say casting like that does a disservice to the story line -- It only serves to distract. Case in point: I recall watching "The Matrix Reloaded" with an Asian friend. After the movie she mentioned there weren't enough Asians in the film. Let's be honest -- there were many Asians cast in TMR, but she argued there "weren't enough". Did she notice anything else about the movie? How about the lighting? The cinematography? The dialog and script writing? The editing? Character development? Nope. She was focused on counting the ratio of Asians, Indians, blacks and whites cast in each role. Oy. Near the end of TLW, Spielberg pays homage to Godzilla, replete with Japanese men running for their lives down a city street. My Asian friend would approve. As would VelociRaptors who were well represented throughout the film. The only group I could see complaining about the movie are the T-Rex, as I'm sure they are fed up being stereotyped and judged as blood-thirsty killers. Over and out.

    Let me just say that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park trilogy. This one was the first that I saw, and even now, I enjoy watching it. Sure, it's not as mind-blowing as Jurassic Park, but The Lost World is a great movie on it's own, even if there are some noticeable flaws. True, every scene is a setup for the next dinosaur attack, sure a velociraptor being knocked out by gymnastics is beyond stupid, and yeah, Sam Neill and Laura Dern are not in this movie, but there are a lot more positives concerning this movie than there are negatives. First of all, I'm glad Jeff Goldblum's character Ian Malcolm was given the lead, because this time around we really got to know him better and he was a lot more serious, mainly because he knows the dangers of facing these dinosaur, and what they're capable of, and Richard Attenborough's cameo as John Hammond was short, but quite a scene-stealing moment, and one of the most endearing moments from the entire film. The new actors(Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, etc) were good, and this is the only movie where I feel like Vince Vaughn showed how good of an actor he is. One complaint that is just stupid is that people complained that Jurassic Park didn't show enough dinosaurs, but when Spielberg showed more in The Lost World, they complained that it was too much. Now about the special effects, the dinosaurs look even better than they did in the first film, because it had been 4 years, and so obviously the effects would be upgraded, and I know people may disagree, but I really love the T-rex running through the streets of San Diego, and it just brings up the level of excitement. Malcolm's daughter is black, and she's kinda bratty, and I liked Lex and Tim (Hammond's grandchildren) better. They were more fun to watch, and their fear was more believable. Overall, The Lost World is a great movie for thrills and the acting is solid enough to keep you invested, but that doesn't change the fact that Jurassic Park was a better movie, told a better story, and had a much better balance in showing the Dinosaurs as creatures and monsters; while Jurassic Park took an hour to show a dinosaur attack, this movie did it almost immediately in the beginning of the film. Another disappointment is that the Velociraptors are less prominent this time around, but they're just as scary as they were in the first movie. But all in all, this movie is fun and thrilling, and the acting is really good, but it lacks the magic and inspiration that made Jurassic Park amazing. 8/10

    Steven Spielberg returned to direct this sequel,(loosely) based on the Michael Crichton novel that sees Jeff Goldblum returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who is enlisted by John Hammond(Richard Attenborough again) to return to Jurassic Park(though on previously unmentioned Site B) to study the dinosaur population, and also to rescue another team, which includes a former flame of his(played by Julianne Moore). He reluctantly agrees, and after locating her, finds to their disgust that the company INGEN has allowed hunting parties to take place, where big-game hunters(led by Pete Postlethwaite) stalk and kill dinosaurs, though the tables would of course be turned... Good sequel has equally effective F/X and terrifying story, though a few too many characters; the twist toward the end is surprising and entertaining, though some poor editing leaves a big plot hole aboard the discovered freighter...still, a worthy sequel that holds up today.

    The Lost World: Jurassic Park is one of the worst sequels ever when comparing it to the original. The characters are ugly, the story is stupid, the only good things are the things reused again, the effects and the score. When a group of scientist go pack for research, they are unaware of another group of people that have plans of their own that bring mayhem among the group and put more people then we would want in trouble. Now like before, they must get help to leave the island before they are the dinosaurs' dinner. This film brought back Jeff Goldblum, but he is nothing like his character in the first movie and is not good as well as Julianne Moore with the best being Vince Vaughn but he is also just eh. They are lifeless souls, waiting to be dinner and are not heroes but pain in the necks. The film's story is rather silly as the scientist roam free so the other people go hunting for a T-Rex as they want to bring one back to San Diego, but it escapes and starts to eat people there while already almost killing everyone at the park but maybe 5 people. Turns out the dinosaur was mad because it wanted its baby, but how did it know it would be hear? The two good things I can pick up from this movie are the effects and score. It was as good as the first, but it's not good enough to help the film. Spielberg has made only one movie that I completely dislike and that's a shame since it could have been good, but we can only hope that it will get better or stop here. Me: D+

    Considered one of Steven Spielberg's worst films, "Jurassic Park: The Lost World" is also considered to be the worst film in the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. While the film does fail with some aspects of the film, it also has its strengths and brings new ideas to the "Jurassic Park" franchise. "Jurassic Park" is one of the films that I see that does not need to have a main antagonist. There are some films I feel like that where it is done well like "Aliens" or "Platoon", but "The Lost World" does not do this. The main antagonist of Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) is a stereotypical businessman who has no idea of what to do. While John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) was like this in the first film, he was not a stereotype, let alone an antagonist. The only thing done right is that he is the opposite of Hammond, being in it for the money while Hammond was in it just to bring something new to people. With the main antagonist comes the problem with the main character, Ian Malcolm. I have no problem with Jeff Goldblum and I loved the character in both the novelizations of "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World" and the first film. This is still the case with this movie but I do not think that Malcolm is a good main character. In the first movie, he was more of a foil character to oppose Hammond instead of someone who was main character material. Also, he still seems to be the designated guy who brings the comic relief. While I was okay with that in the first film, he should not of been like that this much when he was a main character. There were a lot of things I liked, though, as well. The characters are still somewhat interesting as opposed to the blank slates they are in "Jurassic Park III". Plus, the dinosaurs are fleshed out a little as shown being caring parents and not just giant monsters. Along with the fleshing out of the dinosaurs, there is another aspect of the film that I like involving the dinosaurs. The herbivores are dangerous, like they would be in real life which is glossed over in the first and second film. Stegosaurus attack Sarah, a Pachycephalosaurus attacks the mercenaries cars, and the herbivores trash the mercenaries camp. Yes, it is more of a dinosaur attack film but it does show us more of how the animals really would be and not the simple herbivores are nice and safe while the carnivores are mean and dangerous like the other two films do. Taking the pros with the cons, I liked this film and found that it was a good addition to the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. The effects were good, the story was interesting, and the action was superb and tense. While there are some pretty big flaws with the characters, they do not hurt the film a lot.

    Not quite as good as the first one only because several of the first movie cast was not in it. Sam Neill, Laura Dern are two that come to mind. This is still an excellent movie. Jeff Golblum is back as Doctor Ian Malcolm and does his usual good job. His character is still insightful and more importantly he still gets some humorous lines as well. Julianne Moore plays a very tunnel vision doctor that is more interested in the animals than in her own survival, at least at times. One of the not so good guys that are also on this island if the hunter played by Pete Postlethwaite. He is there for the protection but his personal objective is to bag a big one. Well it turns out he gets bagged.

    The first thing to know about 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is that it's not as good as 'Jurassic Park', which is a very high standard to reach. As a young boy, I had reservations about this movie, but it's actually started to slowly grow on me more over time. People may find this strange because of the huge amount of hate towards this film, but I find there's still merit to be found. Story: After a family on a yacht cruise discovers Isla Sorna, the factory floor island owned by InGen, and their daughter is attacked by a pack of compies, John Hammond is removed as CEO of InGen by his greedy nephew Peter Ludlow. Hammond summons Ian Malcolm, now scarred by experiences in Jurassic Park, and asks him to lead an expedition to document the dinosaurs (at a distance from the carnivores) to earn the government's protection. After discovering his girlfriend, Sarah Harding, is already there, Malcolm joins Nick Van Owen and Eddie Carr and sails to the island. Ludlow arrives with a taskforce led by Roland Tembo capture the dinosaurs and take them to San Diego to flaunt them in a zoo. At night, Nick sabotages the InGen camp and brings an injured baby T-Rex to their trailer to patch it's leg up after Roland had captured to bait the father Rex. The T-Rex parents soon retrieve the infant and push the trailer over a cliff, and Eddie is killed trying to save Malcolm and team before InGen arrives to help them out. Both stranded teams concede to join forces to get off the island. The film culminates in a fun (if divisive) 15-minute sequence when the male T-Rex rampages through San Diego searching for his infant, paying homage to 'King Kong' and 1925's 'The Lost World'. One key problem most people have with "The Lost World" is that it's not as filled with wonder as the original, and this film certainly could have benefited from more scenes with the herbivores and characters enjoying the island ambiance. Judging by some unrealistic moments and plot holes, such as the way the trailer fell or the scene where Malcolm's daughter is able to defeat a Raptor with gymnastics, and the fact that the crew of the ship holding the Rex was killed with no clue as to how it happened, Spielberg was not fully committed to this film, which is a real shame. The build-up is also fairly slow, but can be skipped. Personally, the infamous gymnastic scene just makes me chuckle, it's not worth getting angry over. And I admit that I relished in the Rex's travels in San Diego and his reunion with the once-again captured infant. Another major criticism is that main characters cause more death and destruction than the InGen team, and that is partially true. Sarah cannot seem to keep away from dangerous dinosaurs in the field and can be annoying at times, but she still helps lead the T-Rex away from civilians in San Diego. However, Nick is just awful; he's a self- righteous environmentalist whose actions include releasing the captive dinosaurs on the InGen team and stealing the bullets from Roland's rifle to prevent the T-Rex from being killed, thus putting more people in danger. Frankly, I regard him as a hidden antagonist responsible for the chaos, thankfully he's absent from the San Diego sequence. Ultimately, the lack of defined heroes and villains feels more in keeping with the grimness of Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park novel, which was very cynical, and potentially disconcerting to certain people. In this movie's defence, some characters do stand out in a positive light; Ian Malcolm is just as eccentric and witty as ever if more cynical (Jeff Goldblum an acquired taste, really). Another worthy character is Eddie Carr, who is killed by the T-Rexes in the act of saving Malcolm, Sarah and Nick. Hammond's brief appearances were a delight to watch, and the character Roland Tembo is a bold, tactical hunter with an air of dignity and passion that earned my respect as an anti-heroic figure. It isn't really an environmental film so much as one about attaining compromise between two dangerous extremes, personified by Roland and Nick. Another theme is failure to treat what you create with responsibility, as seen with InGen's haughty regard for the dinosaurs as financial assets and not real animals, rather like Frankenstein's negligence towards his creation. Taking the dinosaurs to the mainland zoo would have been disastrous, as Crichton's underlying belief that humans and dinosaurs don't mix is still present. It's also worth remembering that this is a movie of dinosaurs in the wild so there will be higher danger than on the theme park island. I personally find it appealing that we can see the dinosaurs out in the wild simply being dinosaurs, especially the parental instincts of the T- Rexes. The dark, primordial atmosphere of Isla Sorna, accompanied by John Williams' excellent jungle-themed score, does instil a sense that you are in the midst of the dinosaurs' domain, with a few reprisals of the original themes. The CGI dinosaurs look better than most CG creatures today; their behaviour feels genuine, much like real animals, especially with the scenes involving a herd of Stegosaurus and the scenes with the T-Rexes. The animatronics are just as sharp and engaging as the first film, from a technical standpoint, it's well crafted. Ultimately, "The Lost World" is an enjoyable, if reckless, survival film that gives the incredible dinosaurs of InGen a visceral return. Spielberg's style holds it up as an advancement of the Jurassic Park universe. There are plenty of thrills, engrossing action scenes, and a dark and wild atmosphere that could have been helped by more moments of wonder. I certainly wouldn't call this Spielberg's worst movie. Despite being dwarfed by its grander predecessor, it's a fun movie, if flawed.

    (Reviewed on the basis of watching on video 16 years after release) Plot: Ian Malcolm learns about the existence of Site B, Isla Sorna which was the breeding place of all the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park and they are still flourishing there! John Hammond sends a team, headed by Malcolm to the island to gather more information where they encounter another team out to capture the animals. What dangers await them in this 'lost world'? Review: Steven Spielberg films, as I have learned, are meant to be lifelong experiences which curve out a permanent niche in the viewer's hearts. They take us on a journey of a life-time in a trivial period of 120 minutes. Although I am in no position to comment on Spielberg's filmography; having watched just two other masterpieces of the maestro: Jurassic Park and Jaws. But those two films were exactly that- lifetime experiences! Sadly, 'The Lost World' hardly falls in that category. Sequels always have the burden of expectations (especially if the original is a near-perfect classic like Jurassic Park); but one expected better than this. Spielberg himself had requested Michael Crichton to write his literary sequel on which this film sequel is based. It seemed inexplicable as to why the mesmerizing Allan Grant, hero of the original, was replaced by Ian Malcolm who hardly featured in the second half. Crichton possibly felt it unjustified as Malcolm had a more heroic role in his novel and decided to give him his due here (by even miraculously reviving him after his supposed death in the book). The film starts off well promising more thrills at the prospect of only a few people in a dinosaur infested island; with no fences this time. But after a rather tiring build-up, when the team reaches the island they witness the arrival of another team out to capture dinosaurs. Riding on armed vehicles (including motor bikes) they trap the animals almost as a matter of joke. Hunting a jackal would probably be more difficult! The ridiculous ease with which the animals are captured dilutes the whole tension of the film. Even when the animals break-free; the sequence appears more funny than terrifying. Even in JP the real tension had begun post-intermission; but the first half was much more engrossing than here. There the debates, the character interactions and the whole arrangement hooked our attention without much sight of the 'main attractions'. Here we are exposed to a wide range of fauna; but yet the charm is missing with only the Hammond- Malcolm interaction standing out as a debate. Things improve in the second half but unlike just a handful of people in JP; the presence of a large human contingent prevents the generation of much fear (especially having seen their daredevilry earlier). But halfway into the second half, just when the excitement is at its peak, the survivors are whisked away in a helicopter; killing all the tension in an instant. Although more fun was yet to come (thank God!), it was in stark contrast to JP where the excitement had continued to rise culminating in a grand crescendo in the end. The plot has a lot of deviations from the novel, and probably in doing so developed a lot of glaring loopholes. The sequel raises questions about some developments from the first film itself besides having disputes of its own:- 1) If the animals were bred in Site B; then why was the embryo storage located in Site A from where Dennis Nedry stole them? 2) Similarly, it was shown that the velociraptors were artificially hatched in the Site A lab. Was any exception made for not breeding raptors in Site B? Then how could the raptors come into existence there? 3) The lysine deficiency expectedly resulted in the death of all Site A animals. Yet why it didn't apply to Site B was one of the main questions for the team. But it remained unanswered throughout the film. Maybe the script-writer just forgot about it; for was it tough to imagine any explanation like maybe the endemic vegetation of the island was the reason behind it. 4) The justification given by Hammond as to raise public support by furnishing pictures is outrageous. Wouldn't the public be more eager to watch these animals in a zoo? 5) All carnivores were supposed to be in the middle of the island. But in the opening sequence, the compsognathus were seen roaming in herds near the beach. 6) There was no such accident in Site B, unlike Site A. Then why was the radio system along with a bunch of cars left to degrade in the island? 7) How did the T-Rex get trapped underneath the deck of the ship which was bringing it to US, after having killed all the crew above? But the film certainly has its moments. None better, than the tremendous rescue sequence resulting in the terribly tragic death of Eddie. It almost brought me to tears! Plus, the T-Rex chase, the raptor encounters and the ship-crash are the other highlights of the film. There is an element of King Kong in the climax which is good. But is it so easy to drive out a dinosaur within an hour or so? Also, a single dinosaur surrounded by infinite people spells much less fear than the reverse. Jeff Goldblum reprises Malcolm without the old mannerisms. He appears dapper (like a hero should); but the two previous T-Rex encounters have turned him sober from the 'rock-star' avatar, as was described by Hammond. There's hardly much character-interactions this time, except the touching father-daughter relationship. While Jurassic Park was an ultimate cinematic experience; The Lost World is just another good entertainer. But the ending, displaying the dinosaurs with Hammond's speech was masterful. All's well that end's well; but it's still not the end. The dinosaurs will be back; this time with my favorite Sam Neill as Allan Grant; in Jurassic Park III!

    The Lost World, the first sequel to 1993's Jurassic Park is an exhausting, thinly scripted film, that depends entirely on it's action sequences and special effects. Now that I've got the critique out of the way, let me just say that I had a blast watching The Lost World, the rare sequel that improves on the original. The Lost World may be missing some of the majesty and inventiveness of it's predecessor, but The Lost World is more fun, and the dinos are just as thrilling the second time around. 4 unfortunate souls make the dangerous decision to go to Isla Sorna to observe and document the dinosaurs living on the island. Among those five are Ian Malcolm, who had been to the island before, and had been nearly killed as a result of the reptilian beasts. He's hesitant to return, but his mind is made up when he discovers his girl friend, Sarah, is already at the island. And the plot thickens further when it's discovered that one of Ian's daughters, Kelly, manages to stow away to the treacherous place. And when the group discovers that a rival team of considerably more people have also shown up on the island (with more greedy plans in mind), it doesn't take long for the dinosaurs to show their faces. It hardly matters why these individuals have decided to come back to Jurassic Park. The plot is thin, so we're hardly given reasons for why this ill-fated group are choosing to set foot on the island. The obvious lack of story and the forced nature of this sequel is bothersome initially. But once the ball gets rolling, it's nothing but sheer entertainment value. Like the original, The Lost World has a painfully slow start. Obligatory appearances of cast members from the first film and some echoes of John Williams iconic score is all there is to entertain one during the first while. And an awful lot of talking. Seriously, for a film with so little plot, I'm not sure why so much time had to be spent in discussion. At any rate, the fun starts much sooner in this film. The pace picks up a bit about 40 minutes in, but right around the 50 minute mark, The Lost World fires all cylinders and doesn't look bad. Utterly terrifying and remarkably suspenseful, I had a big silly grin on my face for a majority of the action. Admittedly, The Lost World has a few gimmicks. For one, there are two Tyrannosaurs this time around. Twice the dinos means twice the fun, right? Well, not necessarily, but the added dinos were certainly welcome. Don't like being scared? This film isn't for you. Don't like seeing people in horrifying peril? This film isn't for you. Do you insist on some emotional depth or intellectual stimulation when you watch an action flick? Then once again, this film probably isn't for you. But if you kick back and relax, and just turn off your brain, this is one wild ride. Still, the run time is a bit excessive. The Lost World lasts 2 hours and 10 minutes, and I was left pretty exhausted after the first 100 minutes. So while the last half hour is perfectly thrilling, and still plenty of fun, it also felt a bit unnecessary, and a bit tacked on. The characters, like the original, aren't particularly developed. After all, they're not the main attraction here. But for the most part, they're likable when they need to be, and unlikeable when they need to be (though there are exceptions...). The acting is unimpressive, but serviceable. The actors only need to use some big words to describe the equipment they're using, and be able to show obvious signs of terror. As a result, the actors easily fit into their roles, though I couldn't help but hope for more impressive performances considering the talented players here; Jeff Goldblum, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, etc. Richard Attenborough brings plenty of charm to his character though, reprising his role as John Hammond from the original. Still, his part he is extremely small. The special effects has held up well. They look just as good as the ground breaking effects in the original (though they're not quite as innovative the second time around). With more dinosaurs this time around, and more complex action sequences, the special effects team likely had their hands full. It all looks great, though. John William's score, while lacking the iconic nature and grand scale of the original, is still good enough. It's certainly by-the-numbers Williams (and his new theme is completely forgettable), but it still manages to capture the spirit of the film. And fragments of the original themes do find their way into the film, so listen for them. This being my second visit to Jurassic Park, I knew what to expect. Lots of dinosaurs, moments of awe at the beginning, moments of terror everywhere after that, and stupid humans thinking they can control it all. I even made a few light-hearted attempts at guessing those who wouldn't live to see the end credits (I actually got most of my guesses right). But that may be the biggest issue for some; The Lost World doesn't do much to differentiate itself from the original. Still, considering how much fun the original was, that didn't bother me too much.

    Michael Crichton wrote a sequel to his bestselling book Jurassic Park with The Lost World Jurassic Park. Once again Crichton worked with Spielberg to put The Lost World on the big screen. Jeff Goldblum returns with a cast of interesting characters as he goes to a second island where the dinosaurs live free. There are no fences and you can only imagine what happens before you actually see it. I hate to compare the first to the second move but everybody knows I loved the first but not so much the second. Like Anaconda I lived it as a kid because the site of dinosaurs eating people was awesome, but now that I'm older I appreciate characters and relationships etc. What Jurassic Park had in story and characters lacked in The Lost World but The Lost World had the action and excitement that lacked in Jurassic Park. You may ask why Ian Malcolm would revisit the world of dinosaurs and the answer is quite simple. Hammond's company, InGen wants to go to the island and take an animal back to San Diego and put it in a zoo. Hammond sent Malcolm's girlfriend, who happens to be a paleontologist, to the island alone so Malcolm goes to rescue her. The characters and story could have been terrific. Eddie Carr was a great character, Vince Vaughn is in the movie and he gives a really good performance early in his career, and I especially loved the character of Roland. Roland is a hunter who is looking for the ultimate bounty. He is an important character that is underrated. His character could have been so much more and every time he was starting to be built up they cut to a dinosaur eating a smaller character. He was a character I wanted to know about. The movie should have focused on characters like him and the guy with the beard and long hair. He is a dinosaur genius and he has such little screen time. That is the huge flaw in the movie, it is focused too much on the dinosaurs eating people and not enough in the story and its characters. Ian Malcolm was one of the best characters in the 90s and in The Lost World he lost his edge. The snarky comments and brilliance he once had was nowhere to be seen. He had moments of brilliance but he was rewritten as a different character in a way. That was really the only thing that hurt the movie and made it worse than the original. Sequels aren't supposed to be better than the original but the actual dinosaurs and the action scenes were amazing. I could watch the trailer on the cliff scene with the T-Rex over and over again. The CGI and special effects put into the dinosaurs, along with the life size robots were astounding. What lacked in real character development was made up for in the work in the animals themselves. Each dinosaur had its scene to shine and there were a lot more different species. I love the stegosaurus and the Compys. They each had their scenes and some were better than the others but all great. The Compys were a big part of the first book and were not in the movie but I'm glad they found their way into the second one. They are real scavengers and make an impact in the movie. Spielberg and Crichton nail the raptors once again, possibly even better this time. It focused less on the intelligence and more on the ferocity of the animals this time. That could be better because if they focused on intelligence again it could be a little redundant. They appear a little late in the film but they really change it. They look a little different and I'm glad they weren't used simply for killing off all the extras. Then there is the final few scenes, and boy did they not disappoint. It was awesome but at the same time it kind of ruined the lore of Jurassic Park. A major part of the second island is that it is kept secret and nobody knows about it. Without spoiling the ending I'll just say the secret is out, and that's a shame. The book was a great read but after the first movie and how it played out, it only made sense that the book and movie were nothing alike. The really only similarity was the characters themselves and the animals in them. In my other reviews I mentioned the character Dogson and how hia character was ruined in the movies. In the second book he goes to the island and it wouldn't of made sense in this movie. There was only lost potential and another thing that hurt this movie. Overall, The Lost World Jurassic Park was one of my favorite movies when I was little. It still holds up today but still lacks in characters. The action and dinosaurs were fun to look at and were top notch for its time but it wasn't enough to be memorable. I went into this movie wanting more then what I got. I wish they sacrificed some of the action scenes for more character interactions, especially with Roland. There were few glimpses of brilliance but the lack of time spent on characters is the reason I give The Lost World Jurassic Park the WillyT Recommendation. It is a great movie that should be seen at least once. I can watch it every now and then but it isn't as memorable as I'd hoped. It is still a solid film and is a worthy sequel to the classic that was released a few years earlier.

    I hadn't saw The Lost World: Jurassic Park in theaters as I did the 1st installment JP. I still enjoyed the sequel, but maybe it was just as well I saw it on video. The storyline is a fuse of Aliens meets Godzilla. It's similarities to Aliens is pretty pronounced -- same "monster/alien versus man", with corporate profit-focused greedy entities and egos skewing decision-making to make innocent protagonist's lives even more miserable. And the ensuing drama plays out for our entertainment. Throw in the "we-are-surrounded, all-systems-are-down, and-we-must-survive-another-2-days before-the-rescue-team-arrives" clich&eacute; for good measure. The only thing missing is a face-hugger or chest-burst scene. I will give credit for some exciting nail-biter scenes. Some scenes however, are drawn out way too long, almost to a tortured length for suspense. It's never good when the scenes are so long you want to swear at the characters for being so klutzy, stupid or incompetent, and just get on with it already. The Jurassic Park series of movies are based on Michael Crichton's book, which is quite dark. I had a feeling Spielberg didn't know how to approach JP, in terms of the level of violence. It just seemed Spielberg wanted to make a kid-friendly movie with dinosaurs, with a little entertainment thrown in for fun. I'm sure it's a dilemma every director/studio must contend with: Do we have gratuitous violence in the movie, get an R-rating and make less box-office money? Or do we bastardize and water-down the book, leave out scenes entirely, and play up the kid-friendly nature of the violent story-line? It would seem Spielberg went with the latter. JP had a PG rating, which for many parents was an inappropriate rating for kids. Could you imagine Aliens with a PG rating? I won't open this can of worms here, but there is something to be said for how movies are rated, and whether there is politics and, of course, money involved. Me thinks this was the case for JP. Even the name of the movie was misleading to maximize movie goer attendance. How many times have you heard a mother ask her kids "Who wants to go to the park?!" Going to see "Jurassic Park" seemed so natural to take your kids, right?? TLW goes a little darker than JP. And appropriately, is designated a PG-13 rating. It would seem they were still struggling to make this dark story palatable for the widest audience possible. But let's face it, many scenes you will witness water running red with blood. Or human limbs being torn apart with big teeth. Not very far off from Aliensjust minus the chest-burster. I wasn't going to mention this, but it would be a shame NOT to mention it: In the movie, Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Ian Malcolm) has a black daughter. I think that statement is almost an internet meme now. There is no explanation for it, but casting like that does trigger some head-scratching. If there was a black couple that had an Asian daughter, it would be equally as curious -- you would want to know the background story. And judging from the amount of chatter about this topic, I would say casting like that does a disservice to the story line -- It only serves to distract. Case in point: I recall watching "The Matrix Reloaded" with an Asian friend. After the movie she mentioned there weren't enough Asians in the film. Let's be honest -- there were many Asians cast in TMR, but she argued there "weren't enough". Did she notice anything else about the movie? How about the lighting? The cinematography? The dialog and script writing? The editing? Character development? Nope. She was focused on counting the ratio of Asians, Indians, blacks and whites cast in each role. Oy. Near the end of TLW, Spielberg pays homage to Godzilla, replete with Japanese men running for their lives down a city street. My Asian friend would approve. As would VelociRaptors who were well represented throughout the film. The only group I could see complaining about the movie are the T-Rex, as I'm sure they are fed up being stereotyped and judged as blood-thirsty killers. Over and out.

    Let me just say that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park trilogy. This one was the first that I saw, and even now, I enjoy watching it. Sure, it's not as mind-blowing as Jurassic Park, but The Lost World is a great movie on it's own, even if there are some noticeable flaws. True, every scene is a setup for the next dinosaur attack, sure a velociraptor being knocked out by gymnastics is beyond stupid, and yeah, Sam Neill and Laura Dern are not in this movie, but there are a lot more positives concerning this movie than there are negatives. First of all, I'm glad Jeff Goldblum's character Ian Malcolm was given the lead, because this time around we really got to know him better and he was a lot more serious, mainly because he knows the dangers of facing these dinosaur, and what they're capable of, and Richard Attenborough's cameo as John Hammond was short, but quite a scene-stealing moment, and one of the most endearing moments from the entire film. The new actors(Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, etc) were good, and this is the only movie where I feel like Vince Vaughn showed how good of an actor he is. One complaint that is just stupid is that people complained that Jurassic Park didn't show enough dinosaurs, but when Spielberg showed more in The Lost World, they complained that it was too much. Now about the special effects, the dinosaurs look even better than they did in the first film, because it had been 4 years, and so obviously the effects would be upgraded, and I know people may disagree, but I really love the T-rex running through the streets of San Diego, and it just brings up the level of excitement. Malcolm's daughter is black, and she's kinda bratty, and I liked Lex and Tim (Hammond's grandchildren) better. They were more fun to watch, and their fear was more believable. Overall, The Lost World is a great movie for thrills and the acting is solid enough to keep you invested, but that doesn't change the fact that Jurassic Park was a better movie, told a better story, and had a much better balance in showing the Dinosaurs as creatures and monsters; while Jurassic Park took an hour to show a dinosaur attack, this movie did it almost immediately in the beginning of the film. Another disappointment is that the Velociraptors are less prominent this time around, but they're just as scary as they were in the first movie. But all in all, this movie is fun and thrilling, and the acting is really good, but it lacks the magic and inspiration that made Jurassic Park amazing. 8/10

    Steven Spielberg returned to direct this sequel,(loosely) based on the Michael Crichton novel that sees Jeff Goldblum returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who is enlisted by John Hammond(Richard Attenborough again) to return to Jurassic Park(though on previously unmentioned Site B) to study the dinosaur population, and also to rescue another team, which includes a former flame of his(played by Julianne Moore). He reluctantly agrees, and after locating her, finds to their disgust that the company INGEN has allowed hunting parties to take place, where big-game hunters(led by Pete Postlethwaite) stalk and kill dinosaurs, though the tables would of course be turned... Good sequel has equally effective F/X and terrifying story, though a few too many characters; the twist toward the end is surprising and entertaining, though some poor editing leaves a big plot hole aboard the discovered freighter...still, a worthy sequel that holds up today.

    The Lost World: Jurassic Park is one of the worst sequels ever when comparing it to the original. The characters are ugly, the story is stupid, the only good things are the things reused again, the effects and the score. When a group of scientist go pack for research, they are unaware of another group of people that have plans of their own that bring mayhem among the group and put more people then we would want in trouble. Now like before, they must get help to leave the island before they are the dinosaurs' dinner. This film brought back Jeff Goldblum, but he is nothing like his character in the first movie and is not good as well as Julianne Moore with the best being Vince Vaughn but he is also just eh. They are lifeless souls, waiting to be dinner and are not heroes but pain in the necks. The film's story is rather silly as the scientist roam free so the other people go hunting for a T-Rex as they want to bring one back to San Diego, but it escapes and starts to eat people there while already almost killing everyone at the park but maybe 5 people. Turns out the dinosaur was mad because it wanted its baby, but how did it know it would be hear? The two good things I can pick up from this movie are the effects and score. It was as good as the first, but it's not good enough to help the film. Spielberg has made only one movie that I completely dislike and that's a shame since it could have been good, but we can only hope that it will get better or stop here. Me: D+

    Considered one of Steven Spielberg's worst films, "Jurassic Park: The Lost World" is also considered to be the worst film in the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. While the film does fail with some aspects of the film, it also has its strengths and brings new ideas to the "Jurassic Park" franchise. "Jurassic Park" is one of the films that I see that does not need to have a main antagonist. There are some films I feel like that where it is done well like "Aliens" or "Platoon", but "The Lost World" does not do this. The main antagonist of Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) is a stereotypical businessman who has no idea of what to do. While John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) was like this in the first film, he was not a stereotype, let alone an antagonist. The only thing done right is that he is the opposite of Hammond, being in it for the money while Hammond was in it just to bring something new to people. With the main antagonist comes the problem with the main character, Ian Malcolm. I have no problem with Jeff Goldblum and I loved the character in both the novelizations of "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World" and the first film. This is still the case with this movie but I do not think that Malcolm is a good main character. In the first movie, he was more of a foil character to oppose Hammond instead of someone who was main character material. Also, he still seems to be the designated guy who brings the comic relief. While I was okay with that in the first film, he should not of been like that this much when he was a main character. There were a lot of things I liked, though, as well. The characters are still somewhat interesting as opposed to the blank slates they are in "Jurassic Park III". Plus, the dinosaurs are fleshed out a little as shown being caring parents and not just giant monsters. Along with the fleshing out of the dinosaurs, there is another aspect of the film that I like involving the dinosaurs. The herbivores are dangerous, like they would be in real life which is glossed over in the first and second film. Stegosaurus attack Sarah, a Pachycephalosaurus attacks the mercenaries cars, and the herbivores trash the mercenaries camp. Yes, it is more of a dinosaur attack film but it does show us more of how the animals really would be and not the simple herbivores are nice and safe while the carnivores are mean and dangerous like the other two films do. Taking the pros with the cons, I liked this film and found that it was a good addition to the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. The effects were good, the story was interesting, and the action was superb and tense. While there are some pretty big flaws with the characters, they do not hurt the film a lot.

    Not quite as good as the first one only because several of the first movie cast was not in it. Sam Neill, Laura Dern are two that come to mind. This is still an excellent movie. Jeff Golblum is back as Doctor Ian Malcolm and does his usual good job. His character is still insightful and more importantly he still gets some humorous lines as well. Julianne Moore plays a very tunnel vision doctor that is more interested in the animals than in her own survival, at least at times. One of the not so good guys that are also on this island if the hunter played by Pete Postlethwaite. He is there for the protection but his personal objective is to bag a big one. Well it turns out he gets bagged.

    The first thing to know about 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is that it's not as good as 'Jurassic Park', which is a very high standard to reach. As a young boy, I had reservations about this movie, but it's actually started to slowly grow on me more over time. People may find this strange because of the huge amount of hate towards this film, but I find there's still merit to be found. Story: After a family on a yacht cruise discovers Isla Sorna, the factory floor island owned by InGen, and their daughter is attacked by a pack of compies, John Hammond is removed as CEO of InGen by his greedy nephew Peter Ludlow. Hammond summons Ian Malcolm, now scarred by experiences in Jurassic Park, and asks him to lead an expedition to document the dinosaurs (at a distance from the carnivores) to earn the government's protection. After discovering his girlfriend, Sarah Harding, is already there, Malcolm joins Nick Van Owen and Eddie Carr and sails to the island. Ludlow arrives with a taskforce led by Roland Tembo capture the dinosaurs and take them to San Diego to flaunt them in a zoo. At night, Nick sabotages the InGen camp and brings an injured baby T-Rex to their trailer to patch it's leg up after Roland had captured to bait the father Rex. The T-Rex parents soon retrieve the infant and push the trailer over a cliff, and Eddie is killed trying to save Malcolm and team before InGen arrives to help them out. Both stranded teams concede to join forces to get off the island. The film culminates in a fun (if divisive) 15-minute sequence when the male T-Rex rampages through San Diego searching for his infant, paying homage to 'King Kong' and 1925's 'The Lost World'. One key problem most people have with "The Lost World" is that it's not as filled with wonder as the original, and this film certainly could have benefited from more scenes with the herbivores and characters enjoying the island ambiance. Judging by some unrealistic moments and plot holes, such as the way the trailer fell or the scene where Malcolm's daughter is able to defeat a Raptor with gymnastics, and the fact that the crew of the ship holding the Rex was killed with no clue as to how it happened, Spielberg was not fully committed to this film, which is a real shame. The build-up is also fairly slow, but can be skipped. Personally, the infamous gymnastic scene just makes me chuckle, it's not worth getting angry over. And I admit that I relished in the Rex's travels in San Diego and his reunion with the once-again captured infant. Another major criticism is that main characters cause more death and destruction than the InGen team, and that is partially true. Sarah cannot seem to keep away from dangerous dinosaurs in the field and can be annoying at times, but she still helps lead the T-Rex away from civilians in San Diego. However, Nick is just awful; he's a self- righteous environmentalist whose actions include releasing the captive dinosaurs on the InGen team and stealing the bullets from Roland's rifle to prevent the T-Rex from being killed, thus putting more people in danger. Frankly, I regard him as a hidden antagonist responsible for the chaos, thankfully he's absent from the San Diego sequence. Ultimately, the lack of defined heroes and villains feels more in keeping with the grimness of Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park novel, which was very cynical, and potentially disconcerting to certain people. In this movie's defence, some characters do stand out in a positive light; Ian Malcolm is just as eccentric and witty as ever if more cynical (Jeff Goldblum an acquired taste, really). Another worthy character is Eddie Carr, who is killed by the T-Rexes in the act of saving Malcolm, Sarah and Nick. Hammond's brief appearances were a delight to watch, and the character Roland Tembo is a bold, tactical hunter with an air of dignity and passion that earned my respect as an anti-heroic figure. It isn't really an environmental film so much as one about attaining compromise between two dangerous extremes, personified by Roland and Nick. Another theme is failure to treat what you create with responsibility, as seen with InGen's haughty regard for the dinosaurs as financial assets and not real animals, rather like Frankenstein's negligence towards his creation. Taking the dinosaurs to the mainland zoo would have been disastrous, as Crichton's underlying belief that humans and dinosaurs don't mix is still present. It's also worth remembering that this is a movie of dinosaurs in the wild so there will be higher danger than on the theme park island. I personally find it appealing that we can see the dinosaurs out in the wild simply being dinosaurs, especially the parental instincts of the T- Rexes. The dark, primordial atmosphere of Isla Sorna, accompanied by John Williams' excellent jungle-themed score, does instil a sense that you are in the midst of the dinosaurs' domain, with a few reprisals of the original themes. The CGI dinosaurs look better than most CG creatures today; their behaviour feels genuine, much like real animals, especially with the scenes involving a herd of Stegosaurus and the scenes with the T-Rexes. The animatronics are just as sharp and engaging as the first film, from a technical standpoint, it's well crafted. Ultimately, "The Lost World" is an enjoyable, if reckless, survival film that gives the incredible dinosaurs of InGen a visceral return. Spielberg's style holds it up as an advancement of the Jurassic Park universe. There are plenty of thrills, engrossing action scenes, and a dark and wild atmosphere that could have been helped by more moments of wonder. I certainly wouldn't call this Spielberg's worst movie. Despite being dwarfed by its grander predecessor, it's a fun movie, if flawed.

    (Reviewed on the basis of watching on video 16 years after release) Plot: Ian Malcolm learns about the existence of Site B, Isla Sorna which was the breeding place of all the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park and they are still flourishing there! John Hammond sends a team, headed by Malcolm to the island to gather more information where they encounter another team out to capture the animals. What dangers await them in this 'lost world'? Review: Steven Spielberg films, as I have learned, are meant to be lifelong experiences which curve out a permanent niche in the viewer's hearts. They take us on a journey of a life-time in a trivial period of 120 minutes. Although I am in no position to comment on Spielberg's filmography; having watched just two other masterpieces of the maestro: Jurassic Park and Jaws. But those two films were exactly that- lifetime experiences! Sadly, 'The Lost World' hardly falls in that category. Sequels always have the burden of expectations (especially if the original is a near-perfect classic like Jurassic Park); but one expected better than this. Spielberg himself had requested Michael Crichton to write his literary sequel on which this film sequel is based. It seemed inexplicable as to why the mesmerizing Allan Grant, hero of the original, was replaced by Ian Malcolm who hardly featured in the second half. Crichton possibly felt it unjustified as Malcolm had a more heroic role in his novel and decided to give him his due here (by even miraculously reviving him after his supposed death in the book). The film starts off well promising more thrills at the prospect of only a few people in a dinosaur infested island; with no fences this time. But after a rather tiring build-up, when the team reaches the island they witness the arrival of another team out to capture dinosaurs. Riding on armed vehicles (including motor bikes) they trap the animals almost as a matter of joke. Hunting a jackal would probably be more difficult! The ridiculous ease with which the animals are captured dilutes the whole tension of the film. Even when the animals break-free; the sequence appears more funny than terrifying. Even in JP the real tension had begun post-intermission; but the first half was much more engrossing than here. There the debates, the character interactions and the whole arrangement hooked our attention without much sight of the 'main attractions'. Here we are exposed to a wide range of fauna; but yet the charm is missing with only the Hammond- Malcolm interaction standing out as a debate. Things improve in the second half but unlike just a handful of people in JP; the presence of a large human contingent prevents the generation of much fear (especially having seen their daredevilry earlier). But halfway into the second half, just when the excitement is at its peak, the survivors are whisked away in a helicopter; killing all the tension in an instant. Although more fun was yet to come (thank God!), it was in stark contrast to JP where the excitement had continued to rise culminating in a grand crescendo in the end. The plot has a lot of deviations from the novel, and probably in doing so developed a lot of glaring loopholes. The sequel raises questions about some developments from the first film itself besides having disputes of its own:- 1) If the animals were bred in Site B; then why was the embryo storage located in Site A from where Dennis Nedry stole them? 2) Similarly, it was shown that the velociraptors were artificially hatched in the Site A lab. Was any exception made for not breeding raptors in Site B? Then how could the raptors come into existence there? 3) The lysine deficiency expectedly resulted in the death of all Site A animals. Yet why it didn't apply to Site B was one of the main questions for the team. But it remained unanswered throughout the film. Maybe the script-writer just forgot about it; for was it tough to imagine any explanation like maybe the endemic vegetation of the island was the reason behind it. 4) The justification given by Hammond as to raise public support by furnishing pictures is outrageous. Wouldn't the public be more eager to watch these animals in a zoo? 5) All carnivores were supposed to be in the middle of the island. But in the opening sequence, the compsognathus were seen roaming in herds near the beach. 6) There was no such accident in Site B, unlike Site A. Then why was the radio system along with a bunch of cars left to degrade in the island? 7) How did the T-Rex get trapped underneath the deck of the ship which was bringing it to US, after having killed all the crew above? But the film certainly has its moments. None better, than the tremendous rescue sequence resulting in the terribly tragic death of Eddie. It almost brought me to tears! Plus, the T-Rex chase, the raptor encounters and the ship-crash are the other highlights of the film. There is an element of King Kong in the climax which is good. But is it so easy to drive out a dinosaur within an hour or so? Also, a single dinosaur surrounded by infinite people spells much less fear than the reverse. Jeff Goldblum reprises Malcolm without the old mannerisms. He appears dapper (like a hero should); but the two previous T-Rex encounters have turned him sober from the 'rock-star' avatar, as was described by Hammond. There's hardly much character-interactions this time, except the touching father-daughter relationship. While Jurassic Park was an ultimate cinematic experience; The Lost World is just another good entertainer. But the ending, displaying the dinosaurs with Hammond's speech was masterful. All's well that end's well; but it's still not the end. The dinosaurs will be back; this time with my favorite Sam Neill as Allan Grant; in Jurassic Park III!

    The Lost World, the first sequel to 1993's Jurassic Park is an exhausting, thinly scripted film, that depends entirely on it's action sequences and special effects. Now that I've got the critique out of the way, let me just say that I had a blast watching The Lost World, the rare sequel that improves on the original. The Lost World may be missing some of the majesty and inventiveness of it's predecessor, but The Lost World is more fun, and the dinos are just as thrilling the second time around. 4 unfortunate souls make the dangerous decision to go to Isla Sorna to observe and document the dinosaurs living on the island. Among those five are Ian Malcolm, who had been to the island before, and had been nearly killed as a result of the reptilian beasts. He's hesitant to return, but his mind is made up when he discovers his girl friend, Sarah, is already at the island. And the plot thickens further when it's discovered that one of Ian's daughters, Kelly, manages to stow away to the treacherous place. And when the group discovers that a rival team of considerably more people have also shown up on the island (with more greedy plans in mind), it doesn't take long for the dinosaurs to show their faces. It hardly matters why these individuals have decided to come back to Jurassic Park. The plot is thin, so we're hardly given reasons for why this ill-fated group are choosing to set foot on the island. The obvious lack of story and the forced nature of this sequel is bothersome initially. But once the ball gets rolling, it's nothing but sheer entertainment value. Like the original, The Lost World has a painfully slow start. Obligatory appearances of cast members from the first film and some echoes of John Williams iconic score is all there is to entertain one during the first while. And an awful lot of talking. Seriously, for a film with so little plot, I'm not sure why so much time had to be spent in discussion. At any rate, the fun starts much sooner in this film. The pace picks up a bit about 40 minutes in, but right around the 50 minute mark, The Lost World fires all cylinders and doesn't look bad. Utterly terrifying and remarkably suspenseful, I had a big silly grin on my face for a majority of the action. Admittedly, The Lost World has a few gimmicks. For one, there are two Tyrannosaurs this time around. Twice the dinos means twice the fun, right? Well, not necessarily, but the added dinos were certainly welcome. Don't like being scared? This film isn't for you. Don't like seeing people in horrifying peril? This film isn't for you. Do you insist on some emotional depth or intellectual stimulation when you watch an action flick? Then once again, this film probably isn't for you. But if you kick back and relax, and just turn off your brain, this is one wild ride. Still, the run time is a bit excessive. The Lost World lasts 2 hours and 10 minutes, and I was left pretty exhausted after the first 100 minutes. So while the last half hour is perfectly thrilling, and still plenty of fun, it also felt a bit unnecessary, and a bit tacked on. The characters, like the original, aren't particularly developed. After all, they're not the main attraction here. But for the most part, they're likable when they need to be, and unlikeable when they need to be (though there are exceptions...). The acting is unimpressive, but serviceable. The actors only need to use some big words to describe the equipment they're using, and be able to show obvious signs of terror. As a result, the actors easily fit into their roles, though I couldn't help but hope for more impressive performances considering the talented players here; Jeff Goldblum, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, etc. Richard Attenborough brings plenty of charm to his character though, reprising his role as John Hammond from the original. Still, his part he is extremely small. The special effects has held up well. They look just as good as the ground breaking effects in the original (though they're not quite as innovative the second time around). With more dinosaurs this time around, and more complex action sequences, the special effects team likely had their hands full. It all looks great, though. John William's score, while lacking the iconic nature and grand scale of the original, is still good enough. It's certainly by-the-numbers Williams (and his new theme is completely forgettable), but it still manages to capture the spirit of the film. And fragments of the original themes do find their way into the film, so listen for them. This being my second visit to Jurassic Park, I knew what to expect. Lots of dinosaurs, moments of awe at the beginning, moments of terror everywhere after that, and stupid humans thinking they can control it all. I even made a few light-hearted attempts at guessing those who wouldn't live to see the end credits (I actually got most of my guesses right). But that may be the biggest issue for some; The Lost World doesn't do much to differentiate itself from the original. Still, considering how much fun the original was, that didn't bother me too much.

    Michael Crichton wrote a sequel to his bestselling book Jurassic Park with The Lost World Jurassic Park. Once again Crichton worked with Spielberg to put The Lost World on the big screen. Jeff Goldblum returns with a cast of interesting characters as he goes to a second island where the dinosaurs live free. There are no fences and you can only imagine what happens before you actually see it. I hate to compare the first to the second move but everybody knows I loved the first but not so much the second. Like Anaconda I lived it as a kid because the site of dinosaurs eating people was awesome, but now that I'm older I appreciate characters and relationships etc. What Jurassic Park had in story and characters lacked in The Lost World but The Lost World had the action and excitement that lacked in Jurassic Park. You may ask why Ian Malcolm would revisit the world of dinosaurs and the answer is quite simple. Hammond's company, InGen wants to go to the island and take an animal back to San Diego and put it in a zoo. Hammond sent Malcolm's girlfriend, who happens to be a paleontologist, to the island alone so Malcolm goes to rescue her. The characters and story could have been terrific. Eddie Carr was a great character, Vince Vaughn is in the movie and he gives a really good performance early in his career, and I especially loved the character of Roland. Roland is a hunter who is looking for the ultimate bounty. He is an important character that is underrated. His character could have been so much more and every time he was starting to be built up they cut to a dinosaur eating a smaller character. He was a character I wanted to know about. The movie should have focused on characters like him and the guy with the beard and long hair. He is a dinosaur genius and he has such little screen time. That is the huge flaw in the movie, it is focused too much on the dinosaurs eating people and not enough in the story and its characters. Ian Malcolm was one of the best characters in the 90s and in The Lost World he lost his edge. The snarky comments and brilliance he once had was nowhere to be seen. He had moments of brilliance but he was rewritten as a different character in a way. That was really the only thing that hurt the movie and made it worse than the original. Sequels aren't supposed to be better than the original but the actual dinosaurs and the action scenes were amazing. I could watch the trailer on the cliff scene with the T-Rex over and over again. The CGI and special effects put into the dinosaurs, along with the life size robots were astounding. What lacked in real character development was made up for in the work in the animals themselves. Each dinosaur had its scene to shine and there were a lot more different species. I love the stegosaurus and the Compys. They each had their scenes and some were better than the others but all great. The Compys were a big part of the first book and were not in the movie but I'm glad they found their way into the second one. They are real scavengers and make an impact in the movie. Spielberg and Crichton nail the raptors once again, possibly even better this time. It focused less on the intelligence and more on the ferocity of the animals this time. That could be better because if they focused on intelligence again it could be a little redundant. They appear a little late in the film but they really change it. They look a little different and I'm glad they weren't used simply for killing off all the extras. Then there is the final few scenes, and boy did they not disappoint. It was awesome but at the same time it kind of ruined the lore of Jurassic Park. A major part of the second island is that it is kept secret and nobody knows about it. Without spoiling the ending I'll just say the secret is out, and that's a shame. The book was a great read but after the first movie and how it played out, it only made sense that the book and movie were nothing alike. The really only similarity was the characters themselves and the animals in them. In my other reviews I mentioned the character Dogson and how hia character was ruined in the movies. In the second book he goes to the island and it wouldn't of made sense in this movie. There was only lost potential and another thing that hurt this movie. Overall, The Lost World Jurassic Park was one of my favorite movies when I was little. It still holds up today but still lacks in characters. The action and dinosaurs were fun to look at and were top notch for its time but it wasn't enough to be memorable. I went into this movie wanting more then what I got. I wish they sacrificed some of the action scenes for more character interactions, especially with Roland. There were few glimpses of brilliance but the lack of time spent on characters is the reason I give The Lost World Jurassic Park the WillyT Recommendation. It is a great movie that should be seen at least once. I can watch it every now and then but it isn't as memorable as I'd hoped. It is still a solid film and is a worthy sequel to the classic that was released a few years earlier.

    I hadn't saw The Lost World: Jurassic Park in theaters as I did the 1st installment JP. I still enjoyed the sequel, but maybe it was just as well I saw it on video. The storyline is a fuse of Aliens meets Godzilla. It's similarities to Aliens is pretty pronounced -- same "monster/alien versus man", with corporate profit-focused greedy entities and egos skewing decision-making to make innocent protagonist's lives even more miserable. And the ensuing drama plays out for our entertainment. Throw in the "we-are-surrounded, all-systems-are-down, and-we-must-survive-another-2-days before-the-rescue-team-arrives" clich&eacute; for good measure. The only thing missing is a face-hugger or chest-burst scene. I will give credit for some exciting nail-biter scenes. Some scenes however, are drawn out way too long, almost to a tortured length for suspense. It's never good when the scenes are so long you want to swear at the characters for being so klutzy, stupid or incompetent, and just get on with it already. The Jurassic Park series of movies are based on Michael Crichton's book, which is quite dark. I had a feeling Spielberg didn't know how to approach JP, in terms of the level of violence. It just seemed Spielberg wanted to make a kid-friendly movie with dinosaurs, with a little entertainment thrown in for fun. I'm sure it's a dilemma every director/studio must contend with: Do we have gratuitous violence in the movie, get an R-rating and make less box-office money? Or do we bastardize and water-down the book, leave out scenes entirely, and play up the kid-friendly nature of the violent story-line? It would seem Spielberg went with the latter. JP had a PG rating, which for many parents was an inappropriate rating for kids. Could you imagine Aliens with a PG rating? I won't open this can of worms here, but there is something to be said for how movies are rated, and whether there is politics and, of course, money involved. Me thinks this was the case for JP. Even the name of the movie was misleading to maximize movie goer attendance. How many times have you heard a mother ask her kids "Who wants to go to the park?!" Going to see "Jurassic Park" seemed so natural to take your kids, right?? TLW goes a little darker than JP. And appropriately, is designated a PG-13 rating. It would seem they were still struggling to make this dark story palatable for the widest audience possible. But let's face it, many scenes you will witness water running red with blood. Or human limbs being torn apart with big teeth. Not very far off from Aliensjust minus the chest-burster. I wasn't going to mention this, but it would be a shame NOT to mention it: In the movie, Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Ian Malcolm) has a black daughter. I think that statement is almost an internet meme now. There is no explanation for it, but casting like that does trigger some head-scratching. If there was a black couple that had an Asian daughter, it would be equally as curious -- you would want to know the background story. And judging from the amount of chatter about this topic, I would say casting like that does a disservice to the story line -- It only serves to distract. Case in point: I recall watching "The Matrix Reloaded" with an Asian friend. After the movie she mentioned there weren't enough Asians in the film. Let's be honest -- there were many Asians cast in TMR, but she argued there "weren't enough". Did she notice anything else about the movie? How about the lighting? The cinematography? The dialog and script writing? The editing? Character development? Nope. She was focused on counting the ratio of Asians, Indians, blacks and whites cast in each role. Oy. Near the end of TLW, Spielberg pays homage to Godzilla, replete with Japanese men running for their lives down a city street. My Asian friend would approve. As would VelociRaptors who were well represented throughout the film. The only group I could see complaining about the movie are the T-Rex, as I'm sure they are fed up being stereotyped and judged as blood-thirsty killers. Over and out.

    Let me just say that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park trilogy. This one was the first that I saw, and even now, I enjoy watching it. Sure, it's not as mind-blowing as Jurassic Park, but The Lost World is a great movie on it's own, even if there are some noticeable flaws. True, every scene is a setup for the next dinosaur attack, sure a velociraptor being knocked out by gymnastics is beyond stupid, and yeah, Sam Neill and Laura Dern are not in this movie, but there are a lot more positives concerning this movie than there are negatives. First of all, I'm glad Jeff Goldblum's character Ian Malcolm was given the lead, because this time around we really got to know him better and he was a lot more serious, mainly because he knows the dangers of facing these dinosaur, and what they're capable of, and Richard Attenborough's cameo as John Hammond was short, but quite a scene-stealing moment, and one of the most endearing moments from the entire film. The new actors(Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, etc) were good, and this is the only movie where I feel like Vince Vaughn showed how good of an actor he is. One complaint that is just stupid is that people complained that Jurassic Park didn't show enough dinosaurs, but when Spielberg showed more in The Lost World, they complained that it was too much. Now about the special effects, the dinosaurs look even better than they did in the first film, because it had been 4 years, and so obviously the effects would be upgraded, and I know people may disagree, but I really love the T-rex running through the streets of San Diego, and it just brings up the level of excitement. Malcolm's daughter is black, and she's kinda bratty, and I liked Lex and Tim (Hammond's grandchildren) better. They were more fun to watch, and their fear was more believable. Overall, The Lost World is a great movie for thrills and the acting is solid enough to keep you invested, but that doesn't change the fact that Jurassic Park was a better movie, told a better story, and had a much better balance in showing the Dinosaurs as creatures and monsters; while Jurassic Park took an hour to show a dinosaur attack, this movie did it almost immediately in the beginning of the film. Another disappointment is that the Velociraptors are less prominent this time around, but they're just as scary as they were in the first movie. But all in all, this movie is fun and thrilling, and the acting is really good, but it lacks the magic and inspiration that made Jurassic Park amazing. 8/10

    Steven Spielberg returned to direct this sequel,(loosely) based on the Michael Crichton novel that sees Jeff Goldblum returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who is enlisted by John Hammond(Richard Attenborough again) to return to Jurassic Park(though on previously unmentioned Site B) to study the dinosaur population, and also to rescue another team, which includes a former flame of his(played by Julianne Moore). He reluctantly agrees, and after locating her, finds to their disgust that the company INGEN has allowed hunting parties to take place, where big-game hunters(led by Pete Postlethwaite) stalk and kill dinosaurs, though the tables would of course be turned... Good sequel has equally effective F/X and terrifying story, though a few too many characters; the twist toward the end is surprising and entertaining, though some poor editing leaves a big plot hole aboard the discovered freighter...still, a worthy sequel that holds up today.

    The Lost World: Jurassic Park is one of the worst sequels ever when comparing it to the original. The characters are ugly, the story is stupid, the only good things are the things reused again, the effects and the score. When a group of scientist go pack for research, they are unaware of another group of people that have plans of their own that bring mayhem among the group and put more people then we would want in trouble. Now like before, they must get help to leave the island before they are the dinosaurs' dinner. This film brought back Jeff Goldblum, but he is nothing like his character in the first movie and is not good as well as Julianne Moore with the best being Vince Vaughn but he is also just eh. They are lifeless souls, waiting to be dinner and are not heroes but pain in the necks. The film's story is rather silly as the scientist roam free so the other people go hunting for a T-Rex as they want to bring one back to San Diego, but it escapes and starts to eat people there while already almost killing everyone at the park but maybe 5 people. Turns out the dinosaur was mad because it wanted its baby, but how did it know it would be hear? The two good things I can pick up from this movie are the effects and score. It was as good as the first, but it's not good enough to help the film. Spielberg has made only one movie that I completely dislike and that's a shame since it could have been good, but we can only hope that it will get better or stop here. Me: D+

    Considered one of Steven Spielberg's worst films, "Jurassic Park: The Lost World" is also considered to be the worst film in the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. While the film does fail with some aspects of the film, it also has its strengths and brings new ideas to the "Jurassic Park" franchise. "Jurassic Park" is one of the films that I see that does not need to have a main antagonist. There are some films I feel like that where it is done well like "Aliens" or "Platoon", but "The Lost World" does not do this. The main antagonist of Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) is a stereotypical businessman who has no idea of what to do. While John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) was like this in the first film, he was not a stereotype, let alone an antagonist. The only thing done right is that he is the opposite of Hammond, being in it for the money while Hammond was in it just to bring something new to people. With the main antagonist comes the problem with the main character, Ian Malcolm. I have no problem with Jeff Goldblum and I loved the character in both the novelizations of "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World" and the first film. This is still the case with this movie but I do not think that Malcolm is a good main character. In the first movie, he was more of a foil character to oppose Hammond instead of someone who was main character material. Also, he still seems to be the designated guy who brings the comic relief. While I was okay with that in the first film, he should not of been like that this much when he was a main character. There were a lot of things I liked, though, as well. The characters are still somewhat interesting as opposed to the blank slates they are in "Jurassic Park III". Plus, the dinosaurs are fleshed out a little as shown being caring parents and not just giant monsters. Along with the fleshing out of the dinosaurs, there is another aspect of the film that I like involving the dinosaurs. The herbivores are dangerous, like they would be in real life which is glossed over in the first and second film. Stegosaurus attack Sarah, a Pachycephalosaurus attacks the mercenaries cars, and the herbivores trash the mercenaries camp. Yes, it is more of a dinosaur attack film but it does show us more of how the animals really would be and not the simple herbivores are nice and safe while the carnivores are mean and dangerous like the other two films do. Taking the pros with the cons, I liked this film and found that it was a good addition to the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. The effects were good, the story was interesting, and the action was superb and tense. While there are some pretty big flaws with the characters, they do not hurt the film a lot.

    Not quite as good as the first one only because several of the first movie cast was not in it. Sam Neill, Laura Dern are two that come to mind. This is still an excellent movie. Jeff Golblum is back as Doctor Ian Malcolm and does his usual good job. His character is still insightful and more importantly he still gets some humorous lines as well. Julianne Moore plays a very tunnel vision doctor that is more interested in the animals than in her own survival, at least at times. One of the not so good guys that are also on this island if the hunter played by Pete Postlethwaite. He is there for the protection but his personal objective is to bag a big one. Well it turns out he gets bagged.

    The first thing to know about 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is that it's not as good as 'Jurassic Park', which is a very high standard to reach. As a young boy, I had reservations about this movie, but it's actually started to slowly grow on me more over time. People may find this strange because of the huge amount of hate towards this film, but I find there's still merit to be found. Story: After a family on a yacht cruise discovers Isla Sorna, the factory floor island owned by InGen, and their daughter is attacked by a pack of compies, John Hammond is removed as CEO of InGen by his greedy nephew Peter Ludlow. Hammond summons Ian Malcolm, now scarred by experiences in Jurassic Park, and asks him to lead an expedition to document the dinosaurs (at a distance from the carnivores) to earn the government's protection. After discovering his girlfriend, Sarah Harding, is already there, Malcolm joins Nick Van Owen and Eddie Carr and sails to the island. Ludlow arrives with a taskforce led by Roland Tembo capture the dinosaurs and take them to San Diego to flaunt them in a zoo. At night, Nick sabotages the InGen camp and brings an injured baby T-Rex to their trailer to patch it's leg up after Roland had captured to bait the father Rex. The T-Rex parents soon retrieve the infant and push the trailer over a cliff, and Eddie is killed trying to save Malcolm and team before InGen arrives to help them out. Both stranded teams concede to join forces to get off the island. The film culminates in a fun (if divisive) 15-minute sequence when the male T-Rex rampages through San Diego searching for his infant, paying homage to 'King Kong' and 1925's 'The Lost World'. One key problem most people have with "The Lost World" is that it's not as filled with wonder as the original, and this film certainly could have benefited from more scenes with the herbivores and characters enjoying the island ambiance. Judging by some unrealistic moments and plot holes, such as the way the trailer fell or the scene where Malcolm's daughter is able to defeat a Raptor with gymnastics, and the fact that the crew of the ship holding the Rex was killed with no clue as to how it happened, Spielberg was not fully committed to this film, which is a real shame. The build-up is also fairly slow, but can be skipped. Personally, the infamous gymnastic scene just makes me chuckle, it's not worth getting angry over. And I admit that I relished in the Rex's travels in San Diego and his reunion with the once-again captured infant. Another major criticism is that main characters cause more death and destruction than the InGen team, and that is partially true. Sarah cannot seem to keep away from dangerous dinosaurs in the field and can be annoying at times, but she still helps lead the T-Rex away from civilians in San Diego. However, Nick is just awful; he's a self- righteous environmentalist whose actions include releasing the captive dinosaurs on the InGen team and stealing the bullets from Roland's rifle to prevent the T-Rex from being killed, thus putting more people in danger. Frankly, I regard him as a hidden antagonist responsible for the chaos, thankfully he's absent from the San Diego sequence. Ultimately, the lack of defined heroes and villains feels more in keeping with the grimness of Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park novel, which was very cynical, and potentially disconcerting to certain people. In this movie's defence, some characters do stand out in a positive light; Ian Malcolm is just as eccentric and witty as ever if more cynical (Jeff Goldblum an acquired taste, really). Another worthy character is Eddie Carr, who is killed by the T-Rexes in the act of saving Malcolm, Sarah and Nick. Hammond's brief appearances were a delight to watch, and the character Roland Tembo is a bold, tactical hunter with an air of dignity and passion that earned my respect as an anti-heroic figure. It isn't really an environmental film so much as one about attaining compromise between two dangerous extremes, personified by Roland and Nick. Another theme is failure to treat what you create with responsibility, as seen with InGen's haughty regard for the dinosaurs as financial assets and not real animals, rather like Frankenstein's negligence towards his creation. Taking the dinosaurs to the mainland zoo would have been disastrous, as Crichton's underlying belief that humans and dinosaurs don't mix is still present. It's also worth remembering that this is a movie of dinosaurs in the wild so there will be higher danger than on the theme park island. I personally find it appealing that we can see the dinosaurs out in the wild simply being dinosaurs, especially the parental instincts of the T- Rexes. The dark, primordial atmosphere of Isla Sorna, accompanied by John Williams' excellent jungle-themed score, does instil a sense that you are in the midst of the dinosaurs' domain, with a few reprisals of the original themes. The CGI dinosaurs look better than most CG creatures today; their behaviour feels genuine, much like real animals, especially with the scenes involving a herd of Stegosaurus and the scenes with the T-Rexes. The animatronics are just as sharp and engaging as the first film, from a technical standpoint, it's well crafted. Ultimately, "The Lost World" is an enjoyable, if reckless, survival film that gives the incredible dinosaurs of InGen a visceral return. Spielberg's style holds it up as an advancement of the Jurassic Park universe. There are plenty of thrills, engrossing action scenes, and a dark and wild atmosphere that could have been helped by more moments of wonder. I certainly wouldn't call this Spielberg's worst movie. Despite being dwarfed by its grander predecessor, it's a fun movie, if flawed.

    (Reviewed on the basis of watching on video 16 years after release) Plot: Ian Malcolm learns about the existence of Site B, Isla Sorna which was the breeding place of all the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park and they are still flourishing there! John Hammond sends a team, headed by Malcolm to the island to gather more information where they encounter another team out to capture the animals. What dangers await them in this 'lost world'? Review: Steven Spielberg films, as I have learned, are meant to be lifelong experiences which curve out a permanent niche in the viewer's hearts. They take us on a journey of a life-time in a trivial period of 120 minutes. Although I am in no position to comment on Spielberg's filmography; having watched just two other masterpieces of the maestro: Jurassic Park and Jaws. But those two films were exactly that- lifetime experiences! Sadly, 'The Lost World' hardly falls in that category. Sequels always have the burden of expectations (especially if the original is a near-perfect classic like Jurassic Park); but one expected better than this. Spielberg himself had requested Michael Crichton to write his literary sequel on which this film sequel is based. It seemed inexplicable as to why the mesmerizing Allan Grant, hero of the original, was replaced by Ian Malcolm who hardly featured in the second half. Crichton possibly felt it unjustified as Malcolm had a more heroic role in his novel and decided to give him his due here (by even miraculously reviving him after his supposed death in the book). The film starts off well promising more thrills at the prospect of only a few people in a dinosaur infested island; with no fences this time. But after a rather tiring build-up, when the team reaches the island they witness the arrival of another team out to capture dinosaurs. Riding on armed vehicles (including motor bikes) they trap the animals almost as a matter of joke. Hunting a jackal would probably be more difficult! The ridiculous ease with which the animals are captured dilutes the whole tension of the film. Even when the animals break-free; the sequence appears more funny than terrifying. Even in JP the real tension had begun post-intermission; but the first half was much more engrossing than here. There the debates, the character interactions and the whole arrangement hooked our attention without much sight of the 'main attractions'. Here we are exposed to a wide range of fauna; but yet the charm is missing with only the Hammond- Malcolm interaction standing out as a debate. Things improve in the second half but unlike just a handful of people in JP; the presence of a large human contingent prevents the generation of much fear (especially having seen their daredevilry earlier). But halfway into the second half, just when the excitement is at its peak, the survivors are whisked away in a helicopter; killing all the tension in an instant. Although more fun was yet to come (thank God!), it was in stark contrast to JP where the excitement had continued to rise culminating in a grand crescendo in the end. The plot has a lot of deviations from the novel, and probably in doing so developed a lot of glaring loopholes. The sequel raises questions about some developments from the first film itself besides having disputes of its own:- 1) If the animals were bred in Site B; then why was the embryo storage located in Site A from where Dennis Nedry stole them? 2) Similarly, it was shown that the velociraptors were artificially hatched in the Site A lab. Was any exception made for not breeding raptors in Site B? Then how could the raptors come into existence there? 3) The lysine deficiency expectedly resulted in the death of all Site A animals. Yet why it didn't apply to Site B was one of the main questions for the team. But it remained unanswered throughout the film. Maybe the script-writer just forgot about it; for was it tough to imagine any explanation like maybe the endemic vegetation of the island was the reason behind it. 4) The justification given by Hammond as to raise public support by furnishing pictures is outrageous. Wouldn't the public be more eager to watch these animals in a zoo? 5) All carnivores were supposed to be in the middle of the island. But in the opening sequence, the compsognathus were seen roaming in herds near the beach. 6) There was no such accident in Site B, unlike Site A. Then why was the radio system along with a bunch of cars left to degrade in the island? 7) How did the T-Rex get trapped underneath the deck of the ship which was bringing it to US, after having killed all the crew above? But the film certainly has its moments. None better, than the tremendous rescue sequence resulting in the terribly tragic death of Eddie. It almost brought me to tears! Plus, the T-Rex chase, the raptor encounters and the ship-crash are the other highlights of the film. There is an element of King Kong in the climax which is good. But is it so easy to drive out a dinosaur within an hour or so? Also, a single dinosaur surrounded by infinite people spells much less fear than the reverse. Jeff Goldblum reprises Malcolm without the old mannerisms. He appears dapper (like a hero should); but the two previous T-Rex encounters have turned him sober from the 'rock-star' avatar, as was described by Hammond. There's hardly much character-interactions this time, except the touching father-daughter relationship. While Jurassic Park was an ultimate cinematic experience; The Lost World is just another good entertainer. But the ending, displaying the dinosaurs with Hammond's speech was masterful. All's well that end's well; but it's still not the end. The dinosaurs will be back; this time with my favorite Sam Neill as Allan Grant; in Jurassic Park III!

    The Lost World, the first sequel to 1993's Jurassic Park is an exhausting, thinly scripted film, that depends entirely on it's action sequences and special effects. Now that I've got the critique out of the way, let me just say that I had a blast watching The Lost World, the rare sequel that improves on the original. The Lost World may be missing some of the majesty and inventiveness of it's predecessor, but The Lost World is more fun, and the dinos are just as thrilling the second time around. 4 unfortunate souls make the dangerous decision to go to Isla Sorna to observe and document the dinosaurs living on the island. Among those five are Ian Malcolm, who had been to the island before, and had been nearly killed as a result of the reptilian beasts. He's hesitant to return, but his mind is made up when he discovers his girl friend, Sarah, is already at the island. And the plot thickens further when it's discovered that one of Ian's daughters, Kelly, manages to stow away to the treacherous place. And when the group discovers that a rival team of considerably more people have also shown up on the island (with more greedy plans in mind), it doesn't take long for the dinosaurs to show their faces. It hardly matters why these individuals have decided to come back to Jurassic Park. The plot is thin, so we're hardly given reasons for why this ill-fated group are choosing to set foot on the island. The obvious lack of story and the forced nature of this sequel is bothersome initially. But once the ball gets rolling, it's nothing but sheer entertainment value. Like the original, The Lost World has a painfully slow start. Obligatory appearances of cast members from the first film and some echoes of John Williams iconic score is all there is to entertain one during the first while. And an awful lot of talking. Seriously, for a film with so little plot, I'm not sure why so much time had to be spent in discussion. At any rate, the fun starts much sooner in this film. The pace picks up a bit about 40 minutes in, but right around the 50 minute mark, The Lost World fires all cylinders and doesn't look bad. Utterly terrifying and remarkably suspenseful, I had a big silly grin on my face for a majority of the action. Admittedly, The Lost World has a few gimmicks. For one, there are two Tyrannosaurs this time around. Twice the dinos means twice the fun, right? Well, not necessarily, but the added dinos were certainly welcome. Don't like being scared? This film isn't for you. Don't like seeing people in horrifying peril? This film isn't for you. Do you insist on some emotional depth or intellectual stimulation when you watch an action flick? Then once again, this film probably isn't for you. But if you kick back and relax, and just turn off your brain, this is one wild ride. Still, the run time is a bit excessive. The Lost World lasts 2 hours and 10 minutes, and I was left pretty exhausted after the first 100 minutes. So while the last half hour is perfectly thrilling, and still plenty of fun, it also felt a bit unnecessary, and a bit tacked on. The characters, like the original, aren't particularly developed. After all, they're not the main attraction here. But for the most part, they're likable when they need to be, and unlikeable when they need to be (though there are exceptions...). The acting is unimpressive, but serviceable. The actors only need to use some big words to describe the equipment they're using, and be able to show obvious signs of terror. As a result, the actors easily fit into their roles, though I couldn't help but hope for more impressive performances considering the talented players here; Jeff Goldblum, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, etc. Richard Attenborough brings plenty of charm to his character though, reprising his role as John Hammond from the original. Still, his part he is extremely small. The special effects has held up well. They look just as good as the ground breaking effects in the original (though they're not quite as innovative the second time around). With more dinosaurs this time around, and more complex action sequences, the special effects team likely had their hands full. It all looks great, though. John William's score, while lacking the iconic nature and grand scale of the original, is still good enough. It's certainly by-the-numbers Williams (and his new theme is completely forgettable), but it still manages to capture the spirit of the film. And fragments of the original themes do find their way into the film, so listen for them. This being my second visit to Jurassic Park, I knew what to expect. Lots of dinosaurs, moments of awe at the beginning, moments of terror everywhere after that, and stupid humans thinking they can control it all. I even made a few light-hearted attempts at guessing those who wouldn't live to see the end credits (I actually got most of my guesses right). But that may be the biggest issue for some; The Lost World doesn't do much to differentiate itself from the original. Still, considering how much fun the original was, that didn't bother me too much.

    Michael Crichton wrote a sequel to his bestselling book Jurassic Park with The Lost World Jurassic Park. Once again Crichton worked with Spielberg to put The Lost World on the big screen. Jeff Goldblum returns with a cast of interesting characters as he goes to a second island where the dinosaurs live free. There are no fences and you can only imagine what happens before you actually see it. I hate to compare the first to the second move but everybody knows I loved the first but not so much the second. Like Anaconda I lived it as a kid because the site of dinosaurs eating people was awesome, but now that I'm older I appreciate characters and relationships etc. What Jurassic Park had in story and characters lacked in The Lost World but The Lost World had the action and excitement that lacked in Jurassic Park. You may ask why Ian Malcolm would revisit the world of dinosaurs and the answer is quite simple. Hammond's company, InGen wants to go to the island and take an animal back to San Diego and put it in a zoo. Hammond sent Malcolm's girlfriend, who happens to be a paleontologist, to the island alone so Malcolm goes to rescue her. The characters and story could have been terrific. Eddie Carr was a great character, Vince Vaughn is in the movie and he gives a really good performance early in his career, and I especially loved the character of Roland. Roland is a hunter who is looking for the ultimate bounty. He is an important character that is underrated. His character could have been so much more and every time he was starting to be built up they cut to a dinosaur eating a smaller character. He was a character I wanted to know about. The movie should have focused on characters like him and the guy with the beard and long hair. He is a dinosaur genius and he has such little screen time. That is the huge flaw in the movie, it is focused too much on the dinosaurs eating people and not enough in the story and its characters. Ian Malcolm was one of the best characters in the 90s and in The Lost World he lost his edge. The snarky comments and brilliance he once had was nowhere to be seen. He had moments of brilliance but he was rewritten as a different character in a way. That was really the only thing that hurt the movie and made it worse than the original. Sequels aren't supposed to be better than the original but the actual dinosaurs and the action scenes were amazing. I could watch the trailer on the cliff scene with the T-Rex over and over again. The CGI and special effects put into the dinosaurs, along with the life size robots were astounding. What lacked in real character development was made up for in the work in the animals themselves. Each dinosaur had its scene to shine and there were a lot more different species. I love the stegosaurus and the Compys. They each had their scenes and some were better than the others but all great. The Compys were a big part of the first book and were not in the movie but I'm glad they found their way into the second one. They are real scavengers and make an impact in the movie. Spielberg and Crichton nail the raptors once again, possibly even better this time. It focused less on the intelligence and more on the ferocity of the animals this time. That could be better because if they focused on intelligence again it could be a little redundant. They appear a little late in the film but they really change it. They look a little different and I'm glad they weren't used simply for killing off all the extras. Then there is the final few scenes, and boy did they not disappoint. It was awesome but at the same time it kind of ruined the lore of Jurassic Park. A major part of the second island is that it is kept secret and nobody knows about it. Without spoiling the ending I'll just say the secret is out, and that's a shame. The book was a great read but after the first movie and how it played out, it only made sense that the book and movie were nothing alike. The really only similarity was the characters themselves and the animals in them. In my other reviews I mentioned the character Dogson and how hia character was ruined in the movies. In the second book he goes to the island and it wouldn't of made sense in this movie. There was only lost potential and another thing that hurt this movie. Overall, The Lost World Jurassic Park was one of my favorite movies when I was little. It still holds up today but still lacks in characters. The action and dinosaurs were fun to look at and were top notch for its time but it wasn't enough to be memorable. I went into this movie wanting more then what I got. I wish they sacrificed some of the action scenes for more character interactions, especially with Roland. There were few glimpses of brilliance but the lack of time spent on characters is the reason I give The Lost World Jurassic Park the WillyT Recommendation. It is a great movie that should be seen at least once. I can watch it every now and then but it isn't as memorable as I'd hoped. It is still a solid film and is a worthy sequel to the classic that was released a few years earlier.

    I hadn't saw The Lost World: Jurassic Park in theaters as I did the 1st installment JP. I still enjoyed the sequel, but maybe it was just as well I saw it on video. The storyline is a fuse of Aliens meets Godzilla. It's similarities to Aliens is pretty pronounced -- same "monster/alien versus man", with corporate profit-focused greedy entities and egos skewing decision-making to make innocent protagonist's lives even more miserable. And the ensuing drama plays out for our entertainment. Throw in the "we-are-surrounded, all-systems-are-down, and-we-must-survive-another-2-days before-the-rescue-team-arrives" clich&eacute; for good measure. The only thing missing is a face-hugger or chest-burst scene. I will give credit for some exciting nail-biter scenes. Some scenes however, are drawn out way too long, almost to a tortured length for suspense. It's never good when the scenes are so long you want to swear at the characters for being so klutzy, stupid or incompetent, and just get on with it already. The Jurassic Park series of movies are based on Michael Crichton's book, which is quite dark. I had a feeling Spielberg didn't know how to approach JP, in terms of the level of violence. It just seemed Spielberg wanted to make a kid-friendly movie with dinosaurs, with a little entertainment thrown in for fun. I'm sure it's a dilemma every director/studio must contend with: Do we have gratuitous violence in the movie, get an R-rating and make less box-office money? Or do we bastardize and water-down the book, leave out scenes entirely, and play up the kid-friendly nature of the violent story-line? It would seem Spielberg went with the latter. JP had a PG rating, which for many parents was an inappropriate rating for kids. Could you imagine Aliens with a PG rating? I won't open this can of worms here, but there is something to be said for how movies are rated, and whether there is politics and, of course, money involved. Me thinks this was the case for JP. Even the name of the movie was misleading to maximize movie goer attendance. How many times have you heard a mother ask her kids "Who wants to go to the park?!" Going to see "Jurassic Park" seemed so natural to take your kids, right?? TLW goes a little darker than JP. And appropriately, is designated a PG-13 rating. It would seem they were still struggling to make this dark story palatable for the widest audience possible. But let's face it, many scenes you will witness water running red with blood. Or human limbs being torn apart with big teeth. Not very far off from Aliensjust minus the chest-burster. I wasn't going to mention this, but it would be a shame NOT to mention it: In the movie, Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Ian Malcolm) has a black daughter. I think that statement is almost an internet meme now. There is no explanation for it, but casting like that does trigger some head-scratching. If there was a black couple that had an Asian daughter, it would be equally as curious -- you would want to know the background story. And judging from the amount of chatter about this topic, I would say casting like that does a disservice to the story line -- It only serves to distract. Case in point: I recall watching "The Matrix Reloaded" with an Asian friend. After the movie she mentioned there weren't enough Asians in the film. Let's be honest -- there were many Asians cast in TMR, but she argued there "weren't enough". Did she notice anything else about the movie? How about the lighting? The cinematography? The dialog and script writing? The editing? Character development? Nope. She was focused on counting the ratio of Asians, Indians, blacks and whites cast in each role. Oy. Near the end of TLW, Spielberg pays homage to Godzilla, replete with Japanese men running for their lives down a city street. My Asian friend would approve. As would VelociRaptors who were well represented throughout the film. The only group I could see complaining about the movie are the T-Rex, as I'm sure they are fed up being stereotyped and judged as blood-thirsty killers. Over and out.

    Let me just say that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park trilogy. This one was the first that I saw, and even now, I enjoy watching it. Sure, it's not as mind-blowing as Jurassic Park, but The Lost World is a great movie on it's own, even if there are some noticeable flaws. True, every scene is a setup for the next dinosaur attack, sure a velociraptor being knocked out by gymnastics is beyond stupid, and yeah, Sam Neill and Laura Dern are not in this movie, but there are a lot more positives concerning this movie than there are negatives. First of all, I'm glad Jeff Goldblum's character Ian Malcolm was given the lead, because this time around we really got to know him better and he was a lot more serious, mainly because he knows the dangers of facing these dinosaur, and what they're capable of, and Richard Attenborough's cameo as John Hammond was short, but quite a scene-stealing moment, and one of the most endearing moments from the entire film. The new actors(Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, etc) were good, and this is the only movie where I feel like Vince Vaughn showed how good of an actor he is. One complaint that is just stupid is that people complained that Jurassic Park didn't show enough dinosaurs, but when Spielberg showed more in The Lost World, they complained that it was too much. Now about the special effects, the dinosaurs look even better than they did in the first film, because it had been 4 years, and so obviously the effects would be upgraded, and I know people may disagree, but I really love the T-rex running through the streets of San Diego, and it just brings up the level of excitement. Malcolm's daughter is black, and she's kinda bratty, and I liked Lex and Tim (Hammond's grandchildren) better. They were more fun to watch, and their fear was more believable. Overall, The Lost World is a great movie for thrills and the acting is solid enough to keep you invested, but that doesn't change the fact that Jurassic Park was a better movie, told a better story, and had a much better balance in showing the Dinosaurs as creatures and monsters; while Jurassic Park took an hour to show a dinosaur attack, this movie did it almost immediately in the beginning of the film. Another disappointment is that the Velociraptors are less prominent this time around, but they're just as scary as they were in the first movie. But all in all, this movie is fun and thrilling, and the acting is really good, but it lacks the magic and inspiration that made Jurassic Park amazing. 8/10

    Steven Spielberg returned to direct this sequel,(loosely) based on the Michael Crichton novel that sees Jeff Goldblum returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who is enlisted by John Hammond(Richard Attenborough again) to return to Jurassic Park(though on previously unmentioned Site B) to study the dinosaur population, and also to rescue another team, which includes a former flame of his(played by Julianne Moore). He reluctantly agrees, and after locating her, finds to their disgust that the company INGEN has allowed hunting parties to take place, where big-game hunters(led by Pete Postlethwaite) stalk and kill dinosaurs, though the tables would of course be turned... Good sequel has equally effective F/X and terrifying story, though a few too many characters; the twist toward the end is surprising and entertaining, though some poor editing leaves a big plot hole aboard the discovered freighter...still, a worthy sequel that holds up today.

    The Lost World: Jurassic Park is one of the worst sequels ever when comparing it to the original. The characters are ugly, the story is stupid, the only good things are the things reused again, the effects and the score. When a group of scientist go pack for research, they are unaware of another group of people that have plans of their own that bring mayhem among the group and put more people then we would want in trouble. Now like before, they must get help to leave the island before they are the dinosaurs' dinner. This film brought back Jeff Goldblum, but he is nothing like his character in the first movie and is not good as well as Julianne Moore with the best being Vince Vaughn but he is also just eh. They are lifeless souls, waiting to be dinner and are not heroes but pain in the necks. The film's story is rather silly as the scientist roam free so the other people go hunting for a T-Rex as they want to bring one back to San Diego, but it escapes and starts to eat people there while already almost killing everyone at the park but maybe 5 people. Turns out the dinosaur was mad because it wanted its baby, but how did it know it would be hear? The two good things I can pick up from this movie are the effects and score. It was as good as the first, but it's not good enough to help the film. Spielberg has made only one movie that I completely dislike and that's a shame since it could have been good, but we can only hope that it will get better or stop here. Me: D+

    Considered one of Steven Spielberg's worst films, "Jurassic Park: The Lost World" is also considered to be the worst film in the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. While the film does fail with some aspects of the film, it also has its strengths and brings new ideas to the "Jurassic Park" franchise. "Jurassic Park" is one of the films that I see that does not need to have a main antagonist. There are some films I feel like that where it is done well like "Aliens" or "Platoon", but "The Lost World" does not do this. The main antagonist of Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) is a stereotypical businessman who has no idea of what to do. While John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) was like this in the first film, he was not a stereotype, let alone an antagonist. The only thing done right is that he is the opposite of Hammond, being in it for the money while Hammond was in it just to bring something new to people. With the main antagonist comes the problem with the main character, Ian Malcolm. I have no problem with Jeff Goldblum and I loved the character in both the novelizations of "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World" and the first film. This is still the case with this movie but I do not think that Malcolm is a good main character. In the first movie, he was more of a foil character to oppose Hammond instead of someone who was main character material. Also, he still seems to be the designated guy who brings the comic relief. While I was okay with that in the first film, he should not of been like that this much when he was a main character. There were a lot of things I liked, though, as well. The characters are still somewhat interesting as opposed to the blank slates they are in "Jurassic Park III". Plus, the dinosaurs are fleshed out a little as shown being caring parents and not just giant monsters. Along with the fleshing out of the dinosaurs, there is another aspect of the film that I like involving the dinosaurs. The herbivores are dangerous, like they would be in real life which is glossed over in the first and second film. Stegosaurus attack Sarah, a Pachycephalosaurus attacks the mercenaries cars, and the herbivores trash the mercenaries camp. Yes, it is more of a dinosaur attack film but it does show us more of how the animals really would be and not the simple herbivores are nice and safe while the carnivores are mean and dangerous like the other two films do. Taking the pros with the cons, I liked this film and found that it was a good addition to the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. The effects were good, the story was interesting, and the action was superb and tense. While there are some pretty big flaws with the characters, they do not hurt the film a lot.

    Not quite as good as the first one only because several of the first movie cast was not in it. Sam Neill, Laura Dern are two that come to mind. This is still an excellent movie. Jeff Golblum is back as Doctor Ian Malcolm and does his usual good job. His character is still insightful and more importantly he still gets some humorous lines as well. Julianne Moore plays a very tunnel vision doctor that is more interested in the animals than in her own survival, at least at times. One of the not so good guys that are also on this island if the hunter played by Pete Postlethwaite. He is there for the protection but his personal objective is to bag a big one. Well it turns out he gets bagged.

    The first thing to know about 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is that it's not as good as 'Jurassic Park', which is a very high standard to reach. As a young boy, I had reservations about this movie, but it's actually started to slowly grow on me more over time. People may find this strange because of the huge amount of hate towards this film, but I find there's still merit to be found. Story: After a family on a yacht cruise discovers Isla Sorna, the factory floor island owned by InGen, and their daughter is attacked by a pack of compies, John Hammond is removed as CEO of InGen by his greedy nephew Peter Ludlow. Hammond summons Ian Malcolm, now scarred by experiences in Jurassic Park, and asks him to lead an expedition to document the dinosaurs (at a distance from the carnivores) to earn the government's protection. After discovering his girlfriend, Sarah Harding, is already there, Malcolm joins Nick Van Owen and Eddie Carr and sails to the island. Ludlow arrives with a taskforce led by Roland Tembo capture the dinosaurs and take them to San Diego to flaunt them in a zoo. At night, Nick sabotages the InGen camp and brings an injured baby T-Rex to their trailer to patch it's leg up after Roland had captured to bait the father Rex. The T-Rex parents soon retrieve the infant and push the trailer over a cliff, and Eddie is killed trying to save Malcolm and team before InGen arrives to help them out. Both stranded teams concede to join forces to get off the island. The film culminates in a fun (if divisive) 15-minute sequence when the male T-Rex rampages through San Diego searching for his infant, paying homage to 'King Kong' and 1925's 'The Lost World'. One key problem most people have with "The Lost World" is that it's not as filled with wonder as the original, and this film certainly could have benefited from more scenes with the herbivores and characters enjoying the island ambiance. Judging by some unrealistic moments and plot holes, such as the way the trailer fell or the scene where Malcolm's daughter is able to defeat a Raptor with gymnastics, and the fact that the crew of the ship holding the Rex was killed with no clue as to how it happened, Spielberg was not fully committed to this film, which is a real shame. The build-up is also fairly slow, but can be skipped. Personally, the infamous gymnastic scene just makes me chuckle, it's not worth getting angry over. And I admit that I relished in the Rex's travels in San Diego and his reunion with the once-again captured infant. Another major criticism is that main characters cause more death and destruction than the InGen team, and that is partially true. Sarah cannot seem to keep away from dangerous dinosaurs in the field and can be annoying at times, but she still helps lead the T-Rex away from civilians in San Diego. However, Nick is just awful; he's a self- righteous environmentalist whose actions include releasing the captive dinosaurs on the InGen team and stealing the bullets from Roland's rifle to prevent the T-Rex from being killed, thus putting more people in danger. Frankly, I regard him as a hidden antagonist responsible for the chaos, thankfully he's absent from the San Diego sequence. Ultimately, the lack of defined heroes and villains feels more in keeping with the grimness of Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park novel, which was very cynical, and potentially disconcerting to certain people. In this movie's defence, some characters do stand out in a positive light; Ian Malcolm is just as eccentric and witty as ever if more cynical (Jeff Goldblum an acquired taste, really). Another worthy character is Eddie Carr, who is killed by the T-Rexes in the act of saving Malcolm, Sarah and Nick. Hammond's brief appearances were a delight to watch, and the character Roland Tembo is a bold, tactical hunter with an air of dignity and passion that earned my respect as an anti-heroic figure. It isn't really an environmental film so much as one about attaining compromise between two dangerous extremes, personified by Roland and Nick. Another theme is failure to treat what you create with responsibility, as seen with InGen's haughty regard for the dinosaurs as financial assets and not real animals, rather like Frankenstein's negligence towards his creation. Taking the dinosaurs to the mainland zoo would have been disastrous, as Crichton's underlying belief that humans and dinosaurs don't mix is still present. It's also worth remembering that this is a movie of dinosaurs in the wild so there will be higher danger than on the theme park island. I personally find it appealing that we can see the dinosaurs out in the wild simply being dinosaurs, especially the parental instincts of the T- Rexes. The dark, primordial atmosphere of Isla Sorna, accompanied by John Williams' excellent jungle-themed score, does instil a sense that you are in the midst of the dinosaurs' domain, with a few reprisals of the original themes. The CGI dinosaurs look better than most CG creatures today; their behaviour feels genuine, much like real animals, especially with the scenes involving a herd of Stegosaurus and the scenes with the T-Rexes. The animatronics are just as sharp and engaging as the first film, from a technical standpoint, it's well crafted. Ultimately, "The Lost World" is an enjoyable, if reckless, survival film that gives the incredible dinosaurs of InGen a visceral return. Spielberg's style holds it up as an advancement of the Jurassic Park universe. There are plenty of thrills, engrossing action scenes, and a dark and wild atmosphere that could have been helped by more moments of wonder. I certainly wouldn't call this Spielberg's worst movie. Despite being dwarfed by its grander predecessor, it's a fun movie, if flawed.

    (Reviewed on the basis of watching on video 16 years after release) Plot: Ian Malcolm learns about the existence of Site B, Isla Sorna which was the breeding place of all the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park and they are still flourishing there! John Hammond sends a team, headed by Malcolm to the island to gather more information where they encounter another team out to capture the animals. What dangers await them in this 'lost world'? Review: Steven Spielberg films, as I have learned, are meant to be lifelong experiences which curve out a permanent niche in the viewer's hearts. They take us on a journey of a life-time in a trivial period of 120 minutes. Although I am in no position to comment on Spielberg's filmography; having watched just two other masterpieces of the maestro: Jurassic Park and Jaws. But those two films were exactly that- lifetime experiences! Sadly, 'The Lost World' hardly falls in that category. Sequels always have the burden of expectations (especially if the original is a near-perfect classic like Jurassic Park); but one expected better than this. Spielberg himself had requested Michael Crichton to write his literary sequel on which this film sequel is based. It seemed inexplicable as to why the mesmerizing Allan Grant, hero of the original, was replaced by Ian Malcolm who hardly featured in the second half. Crichton possibly felt it unjustified as Malcolm had a more heroic role in his novel and decided to give him his due here (by even miraculously reviving him after his supposed death in the book). The film starts off well promising more thrills at the prospect of only a few people in a dinosaur infested island; with no fences this time. But after a rather tiring build-up, when the team reaches the island they witness the arrival of another team out to capture dinosaurs. Riding on armed vehicles (including motor bikes) they trap the animals almost as a matter of joke. Hunting a jackal would probably be more difficult! The ridiculous ease with which the animals are captured dilutes the whole tension of the film. Even when the animals break-free; the sequence appears more funny than terrifying. Even in JP the real tension had begun post-intermission; but the first half was much more engrossing than here. There the debates, the character interactions and the whole arrangement hooked our attention without much sight of the 'main attractions'. Here we are exposed to a wide range of fauna; but yet the charm is missing with only the Hammond- Malcolm interaction standing out as a debate. Things improve in the second half but unlike just a handful of people in JP; the presence of a large human contingent prevents the generation of much fear (especially having seen their daredevilry earlier). But halfway into the second half, just when the excitement is at its peak, the survivors are whisked away in a helicopter; killing all the tension in an instant. Although more fun was yet to come (thank God!), it was in stark contrast to JP where the excitement had continued to rise culminating in a grand crescendo in the end. The plot has a lot of deviations from the novel, and probably in doing so developed a lot of glaring loopholes. The sequel raises questions about some developments from the first film itself besides having disputes of its own:- 1) If the animals were bred in Site B; then why was the embryo storage located in Site A from where Dennis Nedry stole them? 2) Similarly, it was shown that the velociraptors were artificially hatched in the Site A lab. Was any exception made for not breeding raptors in Site B? Then how could the raptors come into existence there? 3) The lysine deficiency expectedly resulted in the death of all Site A animals. Yet why it didn't apply to Site B was one of the main questions for the team. But it remained unanswered throughout the film. Maybe the script-writer just forgot about it; for was it tough to imagine any explanation like maybe the endemic vegetation of the island was the reason behind it. 4) The justification given by Hammond as to raise public support by furnishing pictures is outrageous. Wouldn't the public be more eager to watch these animals in a zoo? 5) All carnivores were supposed to be in the middle of the island. But in the opening sequence, the compsognathus were seen roaming in herds near the beach. 6) There was no such accident in Site B, unlike Site A. Then why was the radio system along with a bunch of cars left to degrade in the island? 7) How did the T-Rex get trapped underneath the deck of the ship which was bringing it to US, after having killed all the crew above? But the film certainly has its moments. None better, than the tremendous rescue sequence resulting in the terribly tragic death of Eddie. It almost brought me to tears! Plus, the T-Rex chase, the raptor encounters and the ship-crash are the other highlights of the film. There is an element of King Kong in the climax which is good. But is it so easy to drive out a dinosaur within an hour or so? Also, a single dinosaur surrounded by infinite people spells much less fear than the reverse. Jeff Goldblum reprises Malcolm without the old mannerisms. He appears dapper (like a hero should); but the two previous T-Rex encounters have turned him sober from the 'rock-star' avatar, as was described by Hammond. There's hardly much character-interactions this time, except the touching father-daughter relationship. While Jurassic Park was an ultimate cinematic experience; The Lost World is just another good entertainer. But the ending, displaying the dinosaurs with Hammond's speech was masterful. All's well that end's well; but it's still not the end. The dinosaurs will be back; this time with my favorite Sam Neill as Allan Grant; in Jurassic Park III!

    The Lost World, the first sequel to 1993's Jurassic Park is an exhausting, thinly scripted film, that depends entirely on it's action sequences and special effects. Now that I've got the critique out of the way, let me just say that I had a blast watching The Lost World, the rare sequel that improves on the original. The Lost World may be missing some of the majesty and inventiveness of it's predecessor, but The Lost World is more fun, and the dinos are just as thrilling the second time around. 4 unfortunate souls make the dangerous decision to go to Isla Sorna to observe and document the dinosaurs living on the island. Among those five are Ian Malcolm, who had been to the island before, and had been nearly killed as a result of the reptilian beasts. He's hesitant to return, but his mind is made up when he discovers his girl friend, Sarah, is already at the island. And the plot thickens further when it's discovered that one of Ian's daughters, Kelly, manages to stow away to the treacherous place. And when the group discovers that a rival team of considerably more people have also shown up on the island (with more greedy plans in mind), it doesn't take long for the dinosaurs to show their faces. It hardly matters why these individuals have decided to come back to Jurassic Park. The plot is thin, so we're hardly given reasons for why this ill-fated group are choosing to set foot on the island. The obvious lack of story and the forced nature of this sequel is bothersome initially. But once the ball gets rolling, it's nothing but sheer entertainment value. Like the original, The Lost World has a painfully slow start. Obligatory appearances of cast members from the first film and some echoes of John Williams iconic score is all there is to entertain one during the first while. And an awful lot of talking. Seriously, for a film with so little plot, I'm not sure why so much time had to be spent in discussion. At any rate, the fun starts much sooner in this film. The pace picks up a bit about 40 minutes in, but right around the 50 minute mark, The Lost World fires all cylinders and doesn't look bad. Utterly terrifying and remarkably suspenseful, I had a big silly grin on my face for a majority of the action. Admittedly, The Lost World has a few gimmicks. For one, there are two Tyrannosaurs this time around. Twice the dinos means twice the fun, right? Well, not necessarily, but the added dinos were certainly welcome. Don't like being scared? This film isn't for you. Don't like seeing people in horrifying peril? This film isn't for you. Do you insist on some emotional depth or intellectual stimulation when you watch an action flick? Then once again, this film probably isn't for you. But if you kick back and relax, and just turn off your brain, this is one wild ride. Still, the run time is a bit excessive. The Lost World lasts 2 hours and 10 minutes, and I was left pretty exhausted after the first 100 minutes. So while the last half hour is perfectly thrilling, and still plenty of fun, it also felt a bit unnecessary, and a bit tacked on. The characters, like the original, aren't particularly developed. After all, they're not the main attraction here. But for the most part, they're likable when they need to be, and unlikeable when they need to be (though there are exceptions...). The acting is unimpressive, but serviceable. The actors only need to use some big words to describe the equipment they're using, and be able to show obvious signs of terror. As a result, the actors easily fit into their roles, though I couldn't help but hope for more impressive performances considering the talented players here; Jeff Goldblum, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, etc. Richard Attenborough brings plenty of charm to his character though, reprising his role as John Hammond from the original. Still, his part he is extremely small. The special effects has held up well. They look just as good as the ground breaking effects in the original (though they're not quite as innovative the second time around). With more dinosaurs this time around, and more complex action sequences, the special effects team likely had their hands full. It all looks great, though. John William's score, while lacking the iconic nature and grand scale of the original, is still good enough. It's certainly by-the-numbers Williams (and his new theme is completely forgettable), but it still manages to capture the spirit of the film. And fragments of the original themes do find their way into the film, so listen for them. This being my second visit to Jurassic Park, I knew what to expect. Lots of dinosaurs, moments of awe at the beginning, moments of terror everywhere after that, and stupid humans thinking they can control it all. I even made a few light-hearted attempts at guessing those who wouldn't live to see the end credits (I actually got most of my guesses right). But that may be the biggest issue for some; The Lost World doesn't do much to differentiate itself from the original. Still, considering how much fun the original was, that didn't bother me too much.

    Michael Crichton wrote a sequel to his bestselling book Jurassic Park with The Lost World Jurassic Park. Once again Crichton worked with Spielberg to put The Lost World on the big screen. Jeff Goldblum returns with a cast of interesting characters as he goes to a second island where the dinosaurs live free. There are no fences and you can only imagine what happens before you actually see it. I hate to compare the first to the second move but everybody knows I loved the first but not so much the second. Like Anaconda I lived it as a kid because the site of dinosaurs eating people was awesome, but now that I'm older I appreciate characters and relationships etc. What Jurassic Park had in story and characters lacked in The Lost World but The Lost World had the action and excitement that lacked in Jurassic Park. You may ask why Ian Malcolm would revisit the world of dinosaurs and the answer is quite simple. Hammond's company, InGen wants to go to the island and take an animal back to San Diego and put it in a zoo. Hammond sent Malcolm's girlfriend, who happens to be a paleontologist, to the island alone so Malcolm goes to rescue her. The characters and story could have been terrific. Eddie Carr was a great character, Vince Vaughn is in the movie and he gives a really good performance early in his career, and I especially loved the character of Roland. Roland is a hunter who is looking for the ultimate bounty. He is an important character that is underrated. His character could have been so much more and every time he was starting to be built up they cut to a dinosaur eating a smaller character. He was a character I wanted to know about. The movie should have focused on characters like him and the guy with the beard and long hair. He is a dinosaur genius and he has such little screen time. That is the huge flaw in the movie, it is focused too much on the dinosaurs eating people and not enough in the story and its characters. Ian Malcolm was one of the best characters in the 90s and in The Lost World he lost his edge. The snarky comments and brilliance he once had was nowhere to be seen. He had moments of brilliance but he was rewritten as a different character in a way. That was really the only thing that hurt the movie and made it worse than the original. Sequels aren't supposed to be better than the original but the actual dinosaurs and the action scenes were amazing. I could watch the trailer on the cliff scene with the T-Rex over and over again. The CGI and special effects put into the dinosaurs, along with the life size robots were astounding. What lacked in real character development was made up for in the work in the animals themselves. Each dinosaur had its scene to shine and there were a lot more different species. I love the stegosaurus and the Compys. They each had their scenes and some were better than the others but all great. The Compys were a big part of the first book and were not in the movie but I'm glad they found their way into the second one. They are real scavengers and make an impact in the movie. Spielberg and Crichton nail the raptors once again, possibly even better this time. It focused less on the intelligence and more on the ferocity of the animals this time. That could be better because if they focused on intelligence again it could be a little redundant. They appear a little late in the film but they really change it. They look a little different and I'm glad they weren't used simply for killing off all the extras. Then there is the final few scenes, and boy did they not disappoint. It was awesome but at the same time it kind of ruined the lore of Jurassic Park. A major part of the second island is that it is kept secret and nobody knows about it. Without spoiling the ending I'll just say the secret is out, and that's a shame. The book was a great read but after the first movie and how it played out, it only made sense that the book and movie were nothing alike. The really only similarity was the characters themselves and the animals in them. In my other reviews I mentioned the character Dogson and how hia character was ruined in the movies. In the second book he goes to the island and it wouldn't of made sense in this movie. There was only lost potential and another thing that hurt this movie. Overall, The Lost World Jurassic Park was one of my favorite movies when I was little. It still holds up today but still lacks in characters. The action and dinosaurs were fun to look at and were top notch for its time but it wasn't enough to be memorable. I went into this movie wanting more then what I got. I wish they sacrificed some of the action scenes for more character interactions, especially with Roland. There were few glimpses of brilliance but the lack of time spent on characters is the reason I give The Lost World Jurassic Park the WillyT Recommendation. It is a great movie that should be seen at least once. I can watch it every now and then but it isn't as memorable as I'd hoped. It is still a solid film and is a worthy sequel to the classic that was released a few years earlier.

    I hadn't saw The Lost World: Jurassic Park in theaters as I did the 1st installment JP. I still enjoyed the sequel, but maybe it was just as well I saw it on video. The storyline is a fuse of Aliens meets Godzilla. It's similarities to Aliens is pretty pronounced -- same "monster/alien versus man", with corporate profit-focused greedy entities and egos skewing decision-making to make innocent protagonist's lives even more miserable. And the ensuing drama plays out for our entertainment. Throw in the "we-are-surrounded, all-systems-are-down, and-we-must-survive-another-2-days before-the-rescue-team-arrives" clich&eacute; for good measure. The only thing missing is a face-hugger or chest-burst scene. I will give credit for some exciting nail-biter scenes. Some scenes however, are drawn out way too long, almost to a tortured length for suspense. It's never good when the scenes are so long you want to swear at the characters for being so klutzy, stupid or incompetent, and just get on with it already. The Jurassic Park series of movies are based on Michael Crichton's book, which is quite dark. I had a feeling Spielberg didn't know how to approach JP, in terms of the level of violence. It just seemed Spielberg wanted to make a kid-friendly movie with dinosaurs, with a little entertainment thrown in for fun. I'm sure it's a dilemma every director/studio must contend with: Do we have gratuitous violence in the movie, get an R-rating and make less box-office money? Or do we bastardize and water-down the book, leave out scenes entirely, and play up the kid-friendly nature of the violent story-line? It would seem Spielberg went with the latter. JP had a PG rating, which for many parents was an inappropriate rating for kids. Could you imagine Aliens with a PG rating? I won't open this can of worms here, but there is something to be said for how movies are rated, and whether there is politics and, of course, money involved. Me thinks this was the case for JP. Even the name of the movie was misleading to maximize movie goer attendance. How many times have you heard a mother ask her kids "Who wants to go to the park?!" Going to see "Jurassic Park" seemed so natural to take your kids, right?? TLW goes a little darker than JP. And appropriately, is designated a PG-13 rating. It would seem they were still struggling to make this dark story palatable for the widest audience possible. But let's face it, many scenes you will witness water running red with blood. Or human limbs being torn apart with big teeth. Not very far off from Aliensjust minus the chest-burster. I wasn't going to mention this, but it would be a shame NOT to mention it: In the movie, Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Ian Malcolm) has a black daughter. I think that statement is almost an internet meme now. There is no explanation for it, but casting like that does trigger some head-scratching. If there was a black couple that had an Asian daughter, it would be equally as curious -- you would want to know the background story. And judging from the amount of chatter about this topic, I would say casting like that does a disservice to the story line -- It only serves to distract. Case in point: I recall watching "The Matrix Reloaded" with an Asian friend. After the movie she mentioned there weren't enough Asians in the film. Let's be honest -- there were many Asians cast in TMR, but she argued there "weren't enough". Did she notice anything else about the movie? How about the lighting? The cinematography? The dialog and script writing? The editing? Character development? Nope. She was focused on counting the ratio of Asians, Indians, blacks and whites cast in each role. Oy. Near the end of TLW, Spielberg pays homage to Godzilla, replete with Japanese men running for their lives down a city street. My Asian friend would approve. As would VelociRaptors who were well represented throughout the film. The only group I could see complaining about the movie are the T-Rex, as I'm sure they are fed up being stereotyped and judged as blood-thirsty killers. Over and out.

    Let me just say that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park trilogy. This one was the first that I saw, and even now, I enjoy watching it. Sure, it's not as mind-blowing as Jurassic Park, but The Lost World is a great movie on it's own, even if there are some noticeable flaws. True, every scene is a setup for the next dinosaur attack, sure a velociraptor being knocked out by gymnastics is beyond stupid, and yeah, Sam Neill and Laura Dern are not in this movie, but there are a lot more positives concerning this movie than there are negatives. First of all, I'm glad Jeff Goldblum's character Ian Malcolm was given the lead, because this time around we really got to know him better and he was a lot more serious, mainly because he knows the dangers of facing these dinosaur, and what they're capable of, and Richard Attenborough's cameo as John Hammond was short, but quite a scene-stealing moment, and one of the most endearing moments from the entire film. The new actors(Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, etc) were good, and this is the only movie where I feel like Vince Vaughn showed how good of an actor he is. One complaint that is just stupid is that people complained that Jurassic Park didn't show enough dinosaurs, but when Spielberg showed more in The Lost World, they complained that it was too much. Now about the special effects, the dinosaurs look even better than they did in the first film, because it had been 4 years, and so obviously the effects would be upgraded, and I know people may disagree, but I really love the T-rex running through the streets of San Diego, and it just brings up the level of excitement. Malcolm's daughter is black, and she's kinda bratty, and I liked Lex and Tim (Hammond's grandchildren) better. They were more fun to watch, and their fear was more believable. Overall, The Lost World is a great movie for thrills and the acting is solid enough to keep you invested, but that doesn't change the fact that Jurassic Park was a better movie, told a better story, and had a much better balance in showing the Dinosaurs as creatures and monsters; while Jurassic Park took an hour to show a dinosaur attack, this movie did it almost immediately in the beginning of the film. Another disappointment is that the Velociraptors are less prominent this time around, but they're just as scary as they were in the first movie. But all in all, this movie is fun and thrilling, and the acting is really good, but it lacks the magic and inspiration that made Jurassic Park amazing. 8/10

    Steven Spielberg returned to direct this sequel,(loosely) based on the Michael Crichton novel that sees Jeff Goldblum returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who is enlisted by John Hammond(Richard Attenborough again) to return to Jurassic Park(though on previously unmentioned Site B) to study the dinosaur population, and also to rescue another team, which includes a former flame of his(played by Julianne Moore). He reluctantly agrees, and after locating her, finds to their disgust that the company INGEN has allowed hunting parties to take place, where big-game hunters(led by Pete Postlethwaite) stalk and kill dinosaurs, though the tables would of course be turned... Good sequel has equally effective F/X and terrifying story, though a few too many characters; the twist toward the end is surprising and entertaining, though some poor editing leaves a big plot hole aboard the discovered freighter...still, a worthy sequel that holds up today.

    The Lost World: Jurassic Park is one of the worst sequels ever when comparing it to the original. The characters are ugly, the story is stupid, the only good things are the things reused again, the effects and the score. When a group of scientist go pack for research, they are unaware of another group of people that have plans of their own that bring mayhem among the group and put more people then we would want in trouble. Now like before, they must get help to leave the island before they are the dinosaurs' dinner. This film brought back Jeff Goldblum, but he is nothing like his character in the first movie and is not good as well as Julianne Moore with the best being Vince Vaughn but he is also just eh. They are lifeless souls, waiting to be dinner and are not heroes but pain in the necks. The film's story is rather silly as the scientist roam free so the other people go hunting for a T-Rex as they want to bring one back to San Diego, but it escapes and starts to eat people there while already almost killing everyone at the park but maybe 5 people. Turns out the dinosaur was mad because it wanted its baby, but how did it know it would be hear? The two good things I can pick up from this movie are the effects and score. It was as good as the first, but it's not good enough to help the film. Spielberg has made only one movie that I completely dislike and that's a shame since it could have been good, but we can only hope that it will get better or stop here. Me: D+

    Considered one of Steven Spielberg's worst films, "Jurassic Park: The Lost World" is also considered to be the worst film in the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. While the film does fail with some aspects of the film, it also has its strengths and brings new ideas to the "Jurassic Park" franchise. "Jurassic Park" is one of the films that I see that does not need to have a main antagonist. There are some films I feel like that where it is done well like "Aliens" or "Platoon", but "The Lost World" does not do this. The main antagonist of Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) is a stereotypical businessman who has no idea of what to do. While John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) was like this in the first film, he was not a stereotype, let alone an antagonist. The only thing done right is that he is the opposite of Hammond, being in it for the money while Hammond was in it just to bring something new to people. With the main antagonist comes the problem with the main character, Ian Malcolm. I have no problem with Jeff Goldblum and I loved the character in both the novelizations of "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World" and the first film. This is still the case with this movie but I do not think that Malcolm is a good main character. In the first movie, he was more of a foil character to oppose Hammond instead of someone who was main character material. Also, he still seems to be the designated guy who brings the comic relief. While I was okay with that in the first film, he should not of been like that this much when he was a main character. There were a lot of things I liked, though, as well. The characters are still somewhat interesting as opposed to the blank slates they are in "Jurassic Park III". Plus, the dinosaurs are fleshed out a little as shown being caring parents and not just giant monsters. Along with the fleshing out of the dinosaurs, there is another aspect of the film that I like involving the dinosaurs. The herbivores are dangerous, like they would be in real life which is glossed over in the first and second film. Stegosaurus attack Sarah, a Pachycephalosaurus attacks the mercenaries cars, and the herbivores trash the mercenaries camp. Yes, it is more of a dinosaur attack film but it does show us more of how the animals really would be and not the simple herbivores are nice and safe while the carnivores are mean and dangerous like the other two films do. Taking the pros with the cons, I liked this film and found that it was a good addition to the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. The effects were good, the story was interesting, and the action was superb and tense. While there are some pretty big flaws with the characters, they do not hurt the film a lot.

    Not quite as good as the first one only because several of the first movie cast was not in it. Sam Neill, Laura Dern are two that come to mind. This is still an excellent movie. Jeff Golblum is back as Doctor Ian Malcolm and does his usual good job. His character is still insightful and more importantly he still gets some humorous lines as well. Julianne Moore plays a very tunnel vision doctor that is more interested in the animals than in her own survival, at least at times. One of the not so good guys that are also on this island if the hunter played by Pete Postlethwaite. He is there for the protection but his personal objective is to bag a big one. Well it turns out he gets bagged.

    The first thing to know about 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is that it's not as good as 'Jurassic Park', which is a very high standard to reach. As a young boy, I had reservations about this movie, but it's actually started to slowly grow on me more over time. People may find this strange because of the huge amount of hate towards this film, but I find there's still merit to be found. Story: After a family on a yacht cruise discovers Isla Sorna, the factory floor island owned by InGen, and their daughter is attacked by a pack of compies, John Hammond is removed as CEO of InGen by his greedy nephew Peter Ludlow. Hammond summons Ian Malcolm, now scarred by experiences in Jurassic Park, and asks him to lead an expedition to document the dinosaurs (at a distance from the carnivores) to earn the government's protection. After discovering his girlfriend, Sarah Harding, is already there, Malcolm joins Nick Van Owen and Eddie Carr and sails to the island. Ludlow arrives with a taskforce led by Roland Tembo capture the dinosaurs and take them to San Diego to flaunt them in a zoo. At night, Nick sabotages the InGen camp and brings an injured baby T-Rex to their trailer to patch it's leg up after Roland had captured to bait the father Rex. The T-Rex parents soon retrieve the infant and push the trailer over a cliff, and Eddie is killed trying to save Malcolm and team before InGen arrives to help them out. Both stranded teams concede to join forces to get off the island. The film culminates in a fun (if divisive) 15-minute sequence when the male T-Rex rampages through San Diego searching for his infant, paying homage to 'King Kong' and 1925's 'The Lost World'. One key problem most people have with "The Lost World" is that it's not as filled with wonder as the original, and this film certainly could have benefited from more scenes with the herbivores and characters enjoying the island ambiance. Judging by some unrealistic moments and plot holes, such as the way the trailer fell or the scene where Malcolm's daughter is able to defeat a Raptor with gymnastics, and the fact that the crew of the ship holding the Rex was killed with no clue as to how it happened, Spielberg was not fully committed to this film, which is a real shame. The build-up is also fairly slow, but can be skipped. Personally, the infamous gymnastic scene just makes me chuckle, it's not worth getting angry over. And I admit that I relished in the Rex's travels in San Diego and his reunion with the once-again captured infant. Another major criticism is that main characters cause more death and destruction than the InGen team, and that is partially true. Sarah cannot seem to keep away from dangerous dinosaurs in the field and can be annoying at times, but she still helps lead the T-Rex away from civilians in San Diego. However, Nick is just awful; he's a self- righteous environmentalist whose actions include releasing the captive dinosaurs on the InGen team and stealing the bullets from Roland's rifle to prevent the T-Rex from being killed, thus putting more people in danger. Frankly, I regard him as a hidden antagonist responsible for the chaos, thankfully he's absent from the San Diego sequence. Ultimately, the lack of defined heroes and villains feels more in keeping with the grimness of Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park novel, which was very cynical, and potentially disconcerting to certain people. In this movie's defence, some characters do stand out in a positive light; Ian Malcolm is just as eccentric and witty as ever if more cynical (Jeff Goldblum an acquired taste, really). Another worthy character is Eddie Carr, who is killed by the T-Rexes in the act of saving Malcolm, Sarah and Nick. Hammond's brief appearances were a delight to watch, and the character Roland Tembo is a bold, tactical hunter with an air of dignity and passion that earned my respect as an anti-heroic figure. It isn't really an environmental film so much as one about attaining compromise between two dangerous extremes, personified by Roland and Nick. Another theme is failure to treat what you create with responsibility, as seen with InGen's haughty regard for the dinosaurs as financial assets and not real animals, rather like Frankenstein's negligence towards his creation. Taking the dinosaurs to the mainland zoo would have been disastrous, as Crichton's underlying belief that humans and dinosaurs don't mix is still present. It's also worth remembering that this is a movie of dinosaurs in the wild so there will be higher danger than on the theme park island. I personally find it appealing that we can see the dinosaurs out in the wild simply being dinosaurs, especially the parental instincts of the T- Rexes. The dark, primordial atmosphere of Isla Sorna, accompanied by John Williams' excellent jungle-themed score, does instil a sense that you are in the midst of the dinosaurs' domain, with a few reprisals of the original themes. The CGI dinosaurs look better than most CG creatures today; their behaviour feels genuine, much like real animals, especially with the scenes involving a herd of Stegosaurus and the scenes with the T-Rexes. The animatronics are just as sharp and engaging as the first film, from a technical standpoint, it's well crafted. Ultimately, "The Lost World" is an enjoyable, if reckless, survival film that gives the incredible dinosaurs of InGen a visceral return. Spielberg's style holds it up as an advancement of the Jurassic Park universe. There are plenty of thrills, engrossing action scenes, and a dark and wild atmosphere that could have been helped by more moments of wonder. I certainly wouldn't call this Spielberg's worst movie. Despite being dwarfed by its grander predecessor, it's a fun movie, if flawed.

    (Reviewed on the basis of watching on video 16 years after release) Plot: Ian Malcolm learns about the existence of Site B, Isla Sorna which was the breeding place of all the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park and they are still flourishing there! John Hammond sends a team, headed by Malcolm to the island to gather more information where they encounter another team out to capture the animals. What dangers await them in this 'lost world'? Review: Steven Spielberg films, as I have learned, are meant to be lifelong experiences which curve out a permanent niche in the viewer's hearts. They take us on a journey of a life-time in a trivial period of 120 minutes. Although I am in no position to comment on Spielberg's filmography; having watched just two other masterpieces of the maestro: Jurassic Park and Jaws. But those two films were exactly that- lifetime experiences! Sadly, 'The Lost World' hardly falls in that category. Sequels always have the burden of expectations (especially if the original is a near-perfect classic like Jurassic Park); but one expected better than this. Spielberg himself had requested Michael Crichton to write his literary sequel on which this film sequel is based. It seemed inexplicable as to why the mesmerizing Allan Grant, hero of the original, was replaced by Ian Malcolm who hardly featured in the second half. Crichton possibly felt it unjustified as Malcolm had a more heroic role in his novel and decided to give him his due here (by even miraculously reviving him after his supposed death in the book). The film starts off well promising more thrills at the prospect of only a few people in a dinosaur infested island; with no fences this time. But after a rather tiring build-up, when the team reaches the island they witness the arrival of another team out to capture dinosaurs. Riding on armed vehicles (including motor bikes) they trap the animals almost as a matter of joke. Hunting a jackal would probably be more difficult! The ridiculous ease with which the animals are captured dilutes the whole tension of the film. Even when the animals break-free; the sequence appears more funny than terrifying. Even in JP the real tension had begun post-intermission; but the first half was much more engrossing than here. There the debates, the character interactions and the whole arrangement hooked our attention without much sight of the 'main attractions'. Here we are exposed to a wide range of fauna; but yet the charm is missing with only the Hammond- Malcolm interaction standing out as a debate. Things improve in the second half but unlike just a handful of people in JP; the presence of a large human contingent prevents the generation of much fear (especially having seen their daredevilry earlier). But halfway into the second half, just when the excitement is at its peak, the survivors are whisked away in a helicopter; killing all the tension in an instant. Although more fun was yet to come (thank God!), it was in stark contrast to JP where the excitement had continued to rise culminating in a grand crescendo in the end. The plot has a lot of deviations from the novel, and probably in doing so developed a lot of glaring loopholes. The sequel raises questions about some developments from the first film itself besides having disputes of its own:- 1) If the animals were bred in Site B; then why was the embryo storage located in Site A from where Dennis Nedry stole them? 2) Similarly, it was shown that the velociraptors were artificially hatched in the Site A lab. Was any exception made for not breeding raptors in Site B? Then how could the raptors come into existence there? 3) The lysine deficiency expectedly resulted in the death of all Site A animals. Yet why it didn't apply to Site B was one of the main questions for the team. But it remained unanswered throughout the film. Maybe the script-writer just forgot about it; for was it tough to imagine any explanation like maybe the endemic vegetation of the island was the reason behind it. 4) The justification given by Hammond as to raise public support by furnishing pictures is outrageous. Wouldn't the public be more eager to watch these animals in a zoo? 5) All carnivores were supposed to be in the middle of the island. But in the opening sequence, the compsognathus were seen roaming in herds near the beach. 6) There was no such accident in Site B, unlike Site A. Then why was the radio system along with a bunch of cars left to degrade in the island? 7) How did the T-Rex get trapped underneath the deck of the ship which was bringing it to US, after having killed all the crew above? But the film certainly has its moments. None better, than the tremendous rescue sequence resulting in the terribly tragic death of Eddie. It almost brought me to tears! Plus, the T-Rex chase, the raptor encounters and the ship-crash are the other highlights of the film. There is an element of King Kong in the climax which is good. But is it so easy to drive out a dinosaur within an hour or so? Also, a single dinosaur surrounded by infinite people spells much less fear than the reverse. Jeff Goldblum reprises Malcolm without the old mannerisms. He appears dapper (like a hero should); but the two previous T-Rex encounters have turned him sober from the 'rock-star' avatar, as was described by Hammond. There's hardly much character-interactions this time, except the touching father-daughter relationship. While Jurassic Park was an ultimate cinematic experience; The Lost World is just another good entertainer. But the ending, displaying the dinosaurs with Hammond's speech was masterful. All's well that end's well; but it's still not the end. The dinosaurs will be back; this time with my favorite Sam Neill as Allan Grant; in Jurassic Park III!

    The Lost World, the first sequel to 1993's Jurassic Park is an exhausting, thinly scripted film, that depends entirely on it's action sequences and special effects. Now that I've got the critique out of the way, let me just say that I had a blast watching The Lost World, the rare sequel that improves on the original. The Lost World may be missing some of the majesty and inventiveness of it's predecessor, but The Lost World is more fun, and the dinos are just as thrilling the second time around. 4 unfortunate souls make the dangerous decision to go to Isla Sorna to observe and document the dinosaurs living on the island. Among those five are Ian Malcolm, who had been to the island before, and had been nearly killed as a result of the reptilian beasts. He's hesitant to return, but his mind is made up when he discovers his girl friend, Sarah, is already at the island. And the plot thickens further when it's discovered that one of Ian's daughters, Kelly, manages to stow away to the treacherous place. And when the group discovers that a rival team of considerably more people have also shown up on the island (with more greedy plans in mind), it doesn't take long for the dinosaurs to show their faces. It hardly matters why these individuals have decided to come back to Jurassic Park. The plot is thin, so we're hardly given reasons for why this ill-fated group are choosing to set foot on the island. The obvious lack of story and the forced nature of this sequel is bothersome initially. But once the ball gets rolling, it's nothing but sheer entertainment value. Like the original, The Lost World has a painfully slow start. Obligatory appearances of cast members from the first film and some echoes of John Williams iconic score is all there is to entertain one during the first while. And an awful lot of talking. Seriously, for a film with so little plot, I'm not sure why so much time had to be spent in discussion. At any rate, the fun starts much sooner in this film. The pace picks up a bit about 40 minutes in, but right around the 50 minute mark, The Lost World fires all cylinders and doesn't look bad. Utterly terrifying and remarkably suspenseful, I had a big silly grin on my face for a majority of the action. Admittedly, The Lost World has a few gimmicks. For one, there are two Tyrannosaurs this time around. Twice the dinos means twice the fun, right? Well, not necessarily, but the added dinos were certainly welcome. Don't like being scared? This film isn't for you. Don't like seeing people in horrifying peril? This film isn't for you. Do you insist on some emotional depth or intellectual stimulation when you watch an action flick? Then once again, this film probably isn't for you. But if you kick back and relax, and just turn off your brain, this is one wild ride. Still, the run time is a bit excessive. The Lost World lasts 2 hours and 10 minutes, and I was left pretty exhausted after the first 100 minutes. So while the last half hour is perfectly thrilling, and still plenty of fun, it also felt a bit unnecessary, and a bit tacked on. The characters, like the original, aren't particularly developed. After all, they're not the main attraction here. But for the most part, they're likable when they need to be, and unlikeable when they need to be (though there are exceptions...). The acting is unimpressive, but serviceable. The actors only need to use some big words to describe the equipment they're using, and be able to show obvious signs of terror. As a result, the actors easily fit into their roles, though I couldn't help but hope for more impressive performances considering the talented players here; Jeff Goldblum, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, etc. Richard Attenborough brings plenty of charm to his character though, reprising his role as John Hammond from the original. Still, his part he is extremely small. The special effects has held up well. They look just as good as the ground breaking effects in the original (though they're not quite as innovative the second time around). With more dinosaurs this time around, and more complex action sequences, the special effects team likely had their hands full. It all looks great, though. John William's score, while lacking the iconic nature and grand scale of the original, is still good enough. It's certainly by-the-numbers Williams (and his new theme is completely forgettable), but it still manages to capture the spirit of the film. And fragments of the original themes do find their way into the film, so listen for them. This being my second visit to Jurassic Park, I knew what to expect. Lots of dinosaurs, moments of awe at the beginning, moments of terror everywhere after that, and stupid humans thinking they can control it all. I even made a few light-hearted attempts at guessing those who wouldn't live to see the end credits (I actually got most of my guesses right). But that may be the biggest issue for some; The Lost World doesn't do much to differentiate itself from the original. Still, considering how much fun the original was, that didn't bother me too much.

    Michael Crichton wrote a sequel to his bestselling book Jurassic Park with The Lost World Jurassic Park. Once again Crichton worked with Spielberg to put The Lost World on the big screen. Jeff Goldblum returns with a cast of interesting characters as he goes to a second island where the dinosaurs live free. There are no fences and you can only imagine what happens before you actually see it. I hate to compare the first to the second move but everybody knows I loved the first but not so much the second. Like Anaconda I lived it as a kid because the site of dinosaurs eating people was awesome, but now that I'm older I appreciate characters and relationships etc. What Jurassic Park had in story and characters lacked in The Lost World but The Lost World had the action and excitement that lacked in Jurassic Park. You may ask why Ian Malcolm would revisit the world of dinosaurs and the answer is quite simple. Hammond's company, InGen wants to go to the island and take an animal back to San Diego and put it in a zoo. Hammond sent Malcolm's girlfriend, who happens to be a paleontologist, to the island alone so Malcolm goes to rescue her. The characters and story could have been terrific. Eddie Carr was a great character, Vince Vaughn is in the movie and he gives a really good performance early in his career, and I especially loved the character of Roland. Roland is a hunter who is looking for the ultimate bounty. He is an important character that is underrated. His character could have been so much more and every time he was starting to be built up they cut to a dinosaur eating a smaller character. He was a character I wanted to know about. The movie should have focused on characters like him and the guy with the beard and long hair. He is a dinosaur genius and he has such little screen time. That is the huge flaw in the movie, it is focused too much on the dinosaurs eating people and not enough in the story and its characters. Ian Malcolm was one of the best characters in the 90s and in The Lost World he lost his edge. The snarky comments and brilliance he once had was nowhere to be seen. He had moments of brilliance but he was rewritten as a different character in a way. That was really the only thing that hurt the movie and made it worse than the original. Sequels aren't supposed to be better than the original but the actual dinosaurs and the action scenes were amazing. I could watch the trailer on the cliff scene with the T-Rex over and over again. The CGI and special effects put into the dinosaurs, along with the life size robots were astounding. What lacked in real character development was made up for in the work in the animals themselves. Each dinosaur had its scene to shine and there were a lot more different species. I love the stegosaurus and the Compys. They each had their scenes and some were better than the others but all great. The Compys were a big part of the first book and were not in the movie but I'm glad they found their way into the second one. They are real scavengers and make an impact in the movie. Spielberg and Crichton nail the raptors once again, possibly even better this time. It focused less on the intelligence and more on the ferocity of the animals this time. That could be better because if they focused on intelligence again it could be a little redundant. They appear a little late in the film but they really change it. They look a little different and I'm glad they weren't used simply for killing off all the extras. Then there is the final few scenes, and boy did they not disappoint. It was awesome but at the same time it kind of ruined the lore of Jurassic Park. A major part of the second island is that it is kept secret and nobody knows about it. Without spoiling the ending I'll just say the secret is out, and that's a shame. The book was a great read but after the first movie and how it played out, it only made sense that the book and movie were nothing alike. The really only similarity was the characters themselves and the animals in them. In my other reviews I mentioned the character Dogson and how hia character was ruined in the movies. In the second book he goes to the island and it wouldn't of made sense in this movie. There was only lost potential and another thing that hurt this movie. Overall, The Lost World Jurassic Park was one of my favorite movies when I was little. It still holds up today but still lacks in characters. The action and dinosaurs were fun to look at and were top notch for its time but it wasn't enough to be memorable. I went into this movie wanting more then what I got. I wish they sacrificed some of the action scenes for more character interactions, especially with Roland. There were few glimpses of brilliance but the lack of time spent on characters is the reason I give The Lost World Jurassic Park the WillyT Recommendation. It is a great movie that should be seen at least once. I can watch it every now and then but it isn't as memorable as I'd hoped. It is still a solid film and is a worthy sequel to the classic that was released a few years earlier.

    I hadn't saw The Lost World: Jurassic Park in theaters as I did the 1st installment JP. I still enjoyed the sequel, but maybe it was just as well I saw it on video. The storyline is a fuse of Aliens meets Godzilla. It's similarities to Aliens is pretty pronounced -- same "monster/alien versus man", with corporate profit-focused greedy entities and egos skewing decision-making to make innocent protagonist's lives even more miserable. And the ensuing drama plays out for our entertainment. Throw in the "we-are-surrounded, all-systems-are-down, and-we-must-survive-another-2-days before-the-rescue-team-arrives" clich&eacute; for good measure. The only thing missing is a face-hugger or chest-burst scene. I will give credit for some exciting nail-biter scenes. Some scenes however, are drawn out way too long, almost to a tortured length for suspense. It's never good when the scenes are so long you want to swear at the characters for being so klutzy, stupid or incompetent, and just get on with it already. The Jurassic Park series of movies are based on Michael Crichton's book, which is quite dark. I had a feeling Spielberg didn't know how to approach JP, in terms of the level of violence. It just seemed Spielberg wanted to make a kid-friendly movie with dinosaurs, with a little entertainment thrown in for fun. I'm sure it's a dilemma every director/studio must contend with: Do we have gratuitous violence in the movie, get an R-rating and make less box-office money? Or do we bastardize and water-down the book, leave out scenes entirely, and play up the kid-friendly nature of the violent story-line? It would seem Spielberg went with the latter. JP had a PG rating, which for many parents was an inappropriate rating for kids. Could you imagine Aliens with a PG rating? I won't open this can of worms here, but there is something to be said for how movies are rated, and whether there is politics and, of course, money involved. Me thinks this was the case for JP. Even the name of the movie was misleading to maximize movie goer attendance. How many times have you heard a mother ask her kids "Who wants to go to the park?!" Going to see "Jurassic Park" seemed so natural to take your kids, right?? TLW goes a little darker than JP. And appropriately, is designated a PG-13 rating. It would seem they were still struggling to make this dark story palatable for the widest audience possible. But let's face it, many scenes you will witness water running red with blood. Or human limbs being torn apart with big teeth. Not very far off from Aliensjust minus the chest-burster. I wasn't going to mention this, but it would be a shame NOT to mention it: In the movie, Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Ian Malcolm) has a black daughter. I think that statement is almost an internet meme now. There is no explanation for it, but casting like that does trigger some head-scratching. If there was a black couple that had an Asian daughter, it would be equally as curious -- you would want to know the background story. And judging from the amount of chatter about this topic, I would say casting like that does a disservice to the story line -- It only serves to distract. Case in point: I recall watching "The Matrix Reloaded" with an Asian friend. After the movie she mentioned there weren't enough Asians in the film. Let's be honest -- there were many Asians cast in TMR, but she argued there "weren't enough". Did she notice anything else about the movie? How about the lighting? The cinematography? The dialog and script writing? The editing? Character development? Nope. She was focused on counting the ratio of Asians, Indians, blacks and whites cast in each role. Oy. Near the end of TLW, Spielberg pays homage to Godzilla, replete with Japanese men running for their lives down a city street. My Asian friend would approve. As would VelociRaptors who were well represented throughout the film. The only group I could see complaining about the movie are the T-Rex, as I'm sure they are fed up being stereotyped and judged as blood-thirsty killers. Over and out.

    Let me just say that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park trilogy. This one was the first that I saw, and even now, I enjoy watching it. Sure, it's not as mind-blowing as Jurassic Park, but The Lost World is a great movie on it's own, even if there are some noticeable flaws. True, every scene is a setup for the next dinosaur attack, sure a velociraptor being knocked out by gymnastics is beyond stupid, and yeah, Sam Neill and Laura Dern are not in this movie, but there are a lot more positives concerning this movie than there are negatives. First of all, I'm glad Jeff Goldblum's character Ian Malcolm was given the lead, because this time around we really got to know him better and he was a lot more serious, mainly because he knows the dangers of facing these dinosaur, and what they're capable of, and Richard Attenborough's cameo as John Hammond was short, but quite a scene-stealing moment, and one of the most endearing moments from the entire film. The new actors(Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, etc) were good, and this is the only movie where I feel like Vince Vaughn showed how good of an actor he is. One complaint that is just stupid is that people complained that Jurassic Park didn't show enough dinosaurs, but when Spielberg showed more in The Lost World, they complained that it was too much. Now about the special effects, the dinosaurs look even better than they did in the first film, because it had been 4 years, and so obviously the effects would be upgraded, and I know people may disagree, but I really love the T-rex running through the streets of San Diego, and it just brings up the level of excitement. Malcolm's daughter is black, and she's kinda bratty, and I liked Lex and Tim (Hammond's grandchildren) better. They were more fun to watch, and their fear was more believable. Overall, The Lost World is a great movie for thrills and the acting is solid enough to keep you invested, but that doesn't change the fact that Jurassic Park was a better movie, told a better story, and had a much better balance in showing the Dinosaurs as creatures and monsters; while Jurassic Park took an hour to show a dinosaur attack, this movie did it almost immediately in the beginning of the film. Another disappointment is that the Velociraptors are less prominent this time around, but they're just as scary as they were in the first movie. But all in all, this movie is fun and thrilling, and the acting is really good, but it lacks the magic and inspiration that made Jurassic Park amazing. 8/10

    Steven Spielberg returned to direct this sequel,(loosely) based on the Michael Crichton novel that sees Jeff Goldblum returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who is enlisted by John Hammond(Richard Attenborough again) to return to Jurassic Park(though on previously unmentioned Site B) to study the dinosaur population, and also to rescue another team, which includes a former flame of his(played by Julianne Moore). He reluctantly agrees, and after locating her, finds to their disgust that the company INGEN has allowed hunting parties to take place, where big-game hunters(led by Pete Postlethwaite) stalk and kill dinosaurs, though the tables would of course be turned... Good sequel has equally effective F/X and terrifying story, though a few too many characters; the twist toward the end is surprising and entertaining, though some poor editing leaves a big plot hole aboard the discovered freighter...still, a worthy sequel that holds up today.

    The Lost World: Jurassic Park is one of the worst sequels ever when comparing it to the original. The characters are ugly, the story is stupid, the only good things are the things reused again, the effects and the score. When a group of scientist go pack for research, they are unaware of another group of people that have plans of their own that bring mayhem among the group and put more people then we would want in trouble. Now like before, they must get help to leave the island before they are the dinosaurs' dinner. This film brought back Jeff Goldblum, but he is nothing like his character in the first movie and is not good as well as Julianne Moore with the best being Vince Vaughn but he is also just eh. They are lifeless souls, waiting to be dinner and are not heroes but pain in the necks. The film's story is rather silly as the scientist roam free so the other people go hunting for a T-Rex as they want to bring one back to San Diego, but it escapes and starts to eat people there while already almost killing everyone at the park but maybe 5 people. Turns out the dinosaur was mad because it wanted its baby, but how did it know it would be hear? The two good things I can pick up from this movie are the effects and score. It was as good as the first, but it's not good enough to help the film. Spielberg has made only one movie that I completely dislike and that's a shame since it could have been good, but we can only hope that it will get better or stop here. Me: D+

    Considered one of Steven Spielberg's worst films, "Jurassic Park: The Lost World" is also considered to be the worst film in the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. While the film does fail with some aspects of the film, it also has its strengths and brings new ideas to the "Jurassic Park" franchise. "Jurassic Park" is one of the films that I see that does not need to have a main antagonist. There are some films I feel like that where it is done well like "Aliens" or "Platoon", but "The Lost World" does not do this. The main antagonist of Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) is a stereotypical businessman who has no idea of what to do. While John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) was like this in the first film, he was not a stereotype, let alone an antagonist. The only thing done right is that he is the opposite of Hammond, being in it for the money while Hammond was in it just to bring something new to people. With the main antagonist comes the problem with the main character, Ian Malcolm. I have no problem with Jeff Goldblum and I loved the character in both the novelizations of "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World" and the first film. This is still the case with this movie but I do not think that Malcolm is a good main character. In the first movie, he was more of a foil character to oppose Hammond instead of someone who was main character material. Also, he still seems to be the designated guy who brings the comic relief. While I was okay with that in the first film, he should not of been like that this much when he was a main character. There were a lot of things I liked, though, as well. The characters are still somewhat interesting as opposed to the blank slates they are in "Jurassic Park III". Plus, the dinosaurs are fleshed out a little as shown being caring parents and not just giant monsters. Along with the fleshing out of the dinosaurs, there is another aspect of the film that I like involving the dinosaurs. The herbivores are dangerous, like they would be in real life which is glossed over in the first and second film. Stegosaurus attack Sarah, a Pachycephalosaurus attacks the mercenaries cars, and the herbivores trash the mercenaries camp. Yes, it is more of a dinosaur attack film but it does show us more of how the animals really would be and not the simple herbivores are nice and safe while the carnivores are mean and dangerous like the other two films do. Taking the pros with the cons, I liked this film and found that it was a good addition to the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. The effects were good, the story was interesting, and the action was superb and tense. While there are some pretty big flaws with the characters, they do not hurt the film a lot.

    Not quite as good as the first one only because several of the first movie cast was not in it. Sam Neill, Laura Dern are two that come to mind. This is still an excellent movie. Jeff Golblum is back as Doctor Ian Malcolm and does his usual good job. His character is still insightful and more importantly he still gets some humorous lines as well. Julianne Moore plays a very tunnel vision doctor that is more interested in the animals than in her own survival, at least at times. One of the not so good guys that are also on this island if the hunter played by Pete Postlethwaite. He is there for the protection but his personal objective is to bag a big one. Well it turns out he gets bagged.

    The first thing to know about 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is that it's not as good as 'Jurassic Park', which is a very high standard to reach. As a young boy, I had reservations about this movie, but it's actually started to slowly grow on me more over time. People may find this strange because of the huge amount of hate towards this film, but I find there's still merit to be found. Story: After a family on a yacht cruise discovers Isla Sorna, the factory floor island owned by InGen, and their daughter is attacked by a pack of compies, John Hammond is removed as CEO of InGen by his greedy nephew Peter Ludlow. Hammond summons Ian Malcolm, now scarred by experiences in Jurassic Park, and asks him to lead an expedition to document the dinosaurs (at a distance from the carnivores) to earn the government's protection. After discovering his girlfriend, Sarah Harding, is already there, Malcolm joins Nick Van Owen and Eddie Carr and sails to the island. Ludlow arrives with a taskforce led by Roland Tembo capture the dinosaurs and take them to San Diego to flaunt them in a zoo. At night, Nick sabotages the InGen camp and brings an injured baby T-Rex to their trailer to patch it's leg up after Roland had captured to bait the father Rex. The T-Rex parents soon retrieve the infant and push the trailer over a cliff, and Eddie is killed trying to save Malcolm and team before InGen arrives to help them out. Both stranded teams concede to join forces to get off the island. The film culminates in a fun (if divisive) 15-minute sequence when the male T-Rex rampages through San Diego searching for his infant, paying homage to 'King Kong' and 1925's 'The Lost World'. One key problem most people have with "The Lost World" is that it's not as filled with wonder as the original, and this film certainly could have benefited from more scenes with the herbivores and characters enjoying the island ambiance. Judging by some unrealistic moments and plot holes, such as the way the trailer fell or the scene where Malcolm's daughter is able to defeat a Raptor with gymnastics, and the fact that the crew of the ship holding the Rex was killed with no clue as to how it happened, Spielberg was not fully committed to this film, which is a real shame. The build-up is also fairly slow, but can be skipped. Personally, the infamous gymnastic scene just makes me chuckle, it's not worth getting angry over. And I admit that I relished in the Rex's travels in San Diego and his reunion with the once-again captured infant. Another major criticism is that main characters cause more death and destruction than the InGen team, and that is partially true. Sarah cannot seem to keep away from dangerous dinosaurs in the field and can be annoying at times, but she still helps lead the T-Rex away from civilians in San Diego. However, Nick is just awful; he's a self- righteous environmentalist whose actions include releasing the captive dinosaurs on the InGen team and stealing the bullets from Roland's rifle to prevent the T-Rex from being killed, thus putting more people in danger. Frankly, I regard him as a hidden antagonist responsible for the chaos, thankfully he's absent from the San Diego sequence. Ultimately, the lack of defined heroes and villains feels more in keeping with the grimness of Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park novel, which was very cynical, and potentially disconcerting to certain people. In this movie's defence, some characters do stand out in a positive light; Ian Malcolm is just as eccentric and witty as ever if more cynical (Jeff Goldblum an acquired taste, really). Another worthy character is Eddie Carr, who is killed by the T-Rexes in the act of saving Malcolm, Sarah and Nick. Hammond's brief appearances were a delight to watch, and the character Roland Tembo is a bold, tactical hunter with an air of dignity and passion that earned my respect as an anti-heroic figure. It isn't really an environmental film so much as one about attaining compromise between two dangerous extremes, personified by Roland and Nick. Another theme is failure to treat what you create with responsibility, as seen with InGen's haughty regard for the dinosaurs as financial assets and not real animals, rather like Frankenstein's negligence towards his creation. Taking the dinosaurs to the mainland zoo would have been disastrous, as Crichton's underlying belief that humans and dinosaurs don't mix is still present. It's also worth remembering that this is a movie of dinosaurs in the wild so there will be higher danger than on the theme park island. I personally find it appealing that we can see the dinosaurs out in the wild simply being dinosaurs, especially the parental instincts of the T- Rexes. The dark, primordial atmosphere of Isla Sorna, accompanied by John Williams' excellent jungle-themed score, does instil a sense that you are in the midst of the dinosaurs' domain, with a few reprisals of the original themes. The CGI dinosaurs look better than most CG creatures today; their behaviour feels genuine, much like real animals, especially with the scenes involving a herd of Stegosaurus and the scenes with the T-Rexes. The animatronics are just as sharp and engaging as the first film, from a technical standpoint, it's well crafted. Ultimately, "The Lost World" is an enjoyable, if reckless, survival film that gives the incredible dinosaurs of InGen a visceral return. Spielberg's style holds it up as an advancement of the Jurassic Park universe. There are plenty of thrills, engrossing action scenes, and a dark and wild atmosphere that could have been helped by more moments of wonder. I certainly wouldn't call this Spielberg's worst movie. Despite being dwarfed by its grander predecessor, it's a fun movie, if flawed.

    (Reviewed on the basis of watching on video 16 years after release) Plot: Ian Malcolm learns about the existence of Site B, Isla Sorna which was the breeding place of all the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park and they are still flourishing there! John Hammond sends a team, headed by Malcolm to the island to gather more information where they encounter another team out to capture the animals. What dangers await them in this 'lost world'? Review: Steven Spielberg films, as I have learned, are meant to be lifelong experiences which curve out a permanent niche in the viewer's hearts. They take us on a journey of a life-time in a trivial period of 120 minutes. Although I am in no position to comment on Spielberg's filmography; having watched just two other masterpieces of the maestro: Jurassic Park and Jaws. But those two films were exactly that- lifetime experiences! Sadly, 'The Lost World' hardly falls in that category. Sequels always have the burden of expectations (especially if the original is a near-perfect classic like Jurassic Park); but one expected better than this. Spielberg himself had requested Michael Crichton to write his literary sequel on which this film sequel is based. It seemed inexplicable as to why the mesmerizing Allan Grant, hero of the original, was replaced by Ian Malcolm who hardly featured in the second half. Crichton possibly felt it unjustified as Malcolm had a more heroic role in his novel and decided to give him his due here (by even miraculously reviving him after his supposed death in the book). The film starts off well promising more thrills at the prospect of only a few people in a dinosaur infested island; with no fences this time. But after a rather tiring build-up, when the team reaches the island they witness the arrival of another team out to capture dinosaurs. Riding on armed vehicles (including motor bikes) they trap the animals almost as a matter of joke. Hunting a jackal would probably be more difficult! The ridiculous ease with which the animals are captured dilutes the whole tension of the film. Even when the animals break-free; the sequence appears more funny than terrifying. Even in JP the real tension had begun post-intermission; but the first half was much more engrossing than here. There the debates, the character interactions and the whole arrangement hooked our attention without much sight of the 'main attractions'. Here we are exposed to a wide range of fauna; but yet the charm is missing with only the Hammond- Malcolm interaction standing out as a debate. Things improve in the second half but unlike just a handful of people in JP; the presence of a large human contingent prevents the generation of much fear (especially having seen their daredevilry earlier). But halfway into the second half, just when the excitement is at its peak, the survivors are whisked away in a helicopter; killing all the tension in an instant. Although more fun was yet to come (thank God!), it was in stark contrast to JP where the excitement had continued to rise culminating in a grand crescendo in the end. The plot has a lot of deviations from the novel, and probably in doing so developed a lot of glaring loopholes. The sequel raises questions about some developments from the first film itself besides having disputes of its own:- 1) If the animals were bred in Site B; then why was the embryo storage located in Site A from where Dennis Nedry stole them? 2) Similarly, it was shown that the velociraptors were artificially hatched in the Site A lab. Was any exception made for not breeding raptors in Site B? Then how could the raptors come into existence there? 3) The lysine deficiency expectedly resulted in the death of all Site A animals. Yet why it didn't apply to Site B was one of the main questions for the team. But it remained unanswered throughout the film. Maybe the script-writer just forgot about it; for was it tough to imagine any explanation like maybe the endemic vegetation of the island was the reason behind it. 4) The justification given by Hammond as to raise public support by furnishing pictures is outrageous. Wouldn't the public be more eager to watch these animals in a zoo? 5) All carnivores were supposed to be in the middle of the island. But in the opening sequence, the compsognathus were seen roaming in herds near the beach. 6) There was no such accident in Site B, unlike Site A. Then why was the radio system along with a bunch of cars left to degrade in the island? 7) How did the T-Rex get trapped underneath the deck of the ship which was bringing it to US, after having killed all the crew above? But the film certainly has its moments. None better, than the tremendous rescue sequence resulting in the terribly tragic death of Eddie. It almost brought me to tears! Plus, the T-Rex chase, the raptor encounters and the ship-crash are the other highlights of the film. There is an element of King Kong in the climax which is good. But is it so easy to drive out a dinosaur within an hour or so? Also, a single dinosaur surrounded by infinite people spells much less fear than the reverse. Jeff Goldblum reprises Malcolm without the old mannerisms. He appears dapper (like a hero should); but the two previous T-Rex encounters have turned him sober from the 'rock-star' avatar, as was described by Hammond. There's hardly much character-interactions this time, except the touching father-daughter relationship. While Jurassic Park was an ultimate cinematic experience; The Lost World is just another good entertainer. But the ending, displaying the dinosaurs with Hammond's speech was masterful. All's well that end's well; but it's still not the end. The dinosaurs will be back; this time with my favorite Sam Neill as Allan Grant; in Jurassic Park III!

    The Lost World, the first sequel to 1993's Jurassic Park is an exhausting, thinly scripted film, that depends entirely on it's action sequences and special effects. Now that I've got the critique out of the way, let me just say that I had a blast watching The Lost World, the rare sequel that improves on the original. The Lost World may be missing some of the majesty and inventiveness of it's predecessor, but The Lost World is more fun, and the dinos are just as thrilling the second time around. 4 unfortunate souls make the dangerous decision to go to Isla Sorna to observe and document the dinosaurs living on the island. Among those five are Ian Malcolm, who had been to the island before, and had been nearly killed as a result of the reptilian beasts. He's hesitant to return, but his mind is made up when he discovers his girl friend, Sarah, is already at the island. And the plot thickens further when it's discovered that one of Ian's daughters, Kelly, manages to stow away to the treacherous place. And when the group discovers that a rival team of considerably more people have also shown up on the island (with more greedy plans in mind), it doesn't take long for the dinosaurs to show their faces. It hardly matters why these individuals have decided to come back to Jurassic Park. The plot is thin, so we're hardly given reasons for why this ill-fated group are choosing to set foot on the island. The obvious lack of story and the forced nature of this sequel is bothersome initially. But once the ball gets rolling, it's nothing but sheer entertainment value. Like the original, The Lost World has a painfully slow start. Obligatory appearances of cast members from the first film and some echoes of John Williams iconic score is all there is to entertain one during the first while. And an awful lot of talking. Seriously, for a film with so little plot, I'm not sure why so much time had to be spent in discussion. At any rate, the fun starts much sooner in this film. The pace picks up a bit about 40 minutes in, but right around the 50 minute mark, The Lost World fires all cylinders and doesn't look bad. Utterly terrifying and remarkably suspenseful, I had a big silly grin on my face for a majority of the action. Admittedly, The Lost World has a few gimmicks. For one, there are two Tyrannosaurs this time around. Twice the dinos means twice the fun, right? Well, not necessarily, but the added dinos were certainly welcome. Don't like being scared? This film isn't for you. Don't like seeing people in horrifying peril? This film isn't for you. Do you insist on some emotional depth or intellectual stimulation when you watch an action flick? Then once again, this film probably isn't for you. But if you kick back and relax, and just turn off your brain, this is one wild ride. Still, the run time is a bit excessive. The Lost World lasts 2 hours and 10 minutes, and I was left pretty exhausted after the first 100 minutes. So while the last half hour is perfectly thrilling, and still plenty of fun, it also felt a bit unnecessary, and a bit tacked on. The characters, like the original, aren't particularly developed. After all, they're not the main attraction here. But for the most part, they're likable when they need to be, and unlikeable when they need to be (though there are exceptions...). The acting is unimpressive, but serviceable. The actors only need to use some big words to describe the equipment they're using, and be able to show obvious signs of terror. As a result, the actors easily fit into their roles, though I couldn't help but hope for more impressive performances considering the talented players here; Jeff Goldblum, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, etc. Richard Attenborough brings plenty of charm to his character though, reprising his role as John Hammond from the original. Still, his part he is extremely small. The special effects has held up well. They look just as good as the ground breaking effects in the original (though they're not quite as innovative the second time around). With more dinosaurs this time around, and more complex action sequences, the special effects team likely had their hands full. It all looks great, though. John William's score, while lacking the iconic nature and grand scale of the original, is still good enough. It's certainly by-the-numbers Williams (and his new theme is completely forgettable), but it still manages to capture the spirit of the film. And fragments of the original themes do find their way into the film, so listen for them. This being my second visit to Jurassic Park, I knew what to expect. Lots of dinosaurs, moments of awe at the beginning, moments of terror everywhere after that, and stupid humans thinking they can control it all. I even made a few light-hearted attempts at guessing those who wouldn't live to see the end credits (I actually got most of my guesses right). But that may be the biggest issue for some; The Lost World doesn't do much to differentiate itself from the original. Still, considering how much fun the original was, that didn't bother me too much.

    Michael Crichton wrote a sequel to his bestselling book Jurassic Park with The Lost World Jurassic Park. Once again Crichton worked with Spielberg to put The Lost World on the big screen. Jeff Goldblum returns with a cast of interesting characters as he goes to a second island where the dinosaurs live free. There are no fences and you can only imagine what happens before you actually see it. I hate to compare the first to the second move but everybody knows I loved the first but not so much the second. Like Anaconda I lived it as a kid because the site of dinosaurs eating people was awesome, but now that I'm older I appreciate characters and relationships etc. What Jurassic Park had in story and characters lacked in The Lost World but The Lost World had the action and excitement that lacked in Jurassic Park. You may ask why Ian Malcolm would revisit the world of dinosaurs and the answer is quite simple. Hammond's company, InGen wants to go to the island and take an animal back to San Diego and put it in a zoo. Hammond sent Malcolm's girlfriend, who happens to be a paleontologist, to the island alone so Malcolm goes to rescue her. The characters and story could have been terrific. Eddie Carr was a great character, Vince Vaughn is in the movie and he gives a really good performance early in his career, and I especially loved the character of Roland. Roland is a hunter who is looking for the ultimate bounty. He is an important character that is underrated. His character could have been so much more and every time he was starting to be built up they cut to a dinosaur eating a smaller character. He was a character I wanted to know about. The movie should have focused on characters like him and the guy with the beard and long hair. He is a dinosaur genius and he has such little screen time. That is the huge flaw in the movie, it is focused too much on the dinosaurs eating people and not enough in the story and its characters. Ian Malcolm was one of the best characters in the 90s and in The Lost World he lost his edge. The snarky comments and brilliance he once had was nowhere to be seen. He had moments of brilliance but he was rewritten as a different character in a way. That was really the only thing that hurt the movie and made it worse than the original. Sequels aren't supposed to be better than the original but the actual dinosaurs and the action scenes were amazing. I could watch the trailer on the cliff scene with the T-Rex over and over again. The CGI and special effects put into the dinosaurs, along with the life size robots were astounding. What lacked in real character development was made up for in the work in the animals themselves. Each dinosaur had its scene to shine and there were a lot more different species. I love the stegosaurus and the Compys. They each had their scenes and some were better than the others but all great. The Compys were a big part of the first book and were not in the movie but I'm glad they found their way into the second one. They are real scavengers and make an impact in the movie. Spielberg and Crichton nail the raptors once again, possibly even better this time. It focused less on the intelligence and more on the ferocity of the animals this time. That could be better because if they focused on intelligence again it could be a little redundant. They appear a little late in the film but they really change it. They look a little different and I'm glad they weren't used simply for killing off all the extras. Then there is the final few scenes, and boy did they not disappoint. It was awesome but at the same time it kind of ruined the lore of Jurassic Park. A major part of the second island is that it is kept secret and nobody knows about it. Without spoiling the ending I'll just say the secret is out, and that's a shame. The book was a great read but after the first movie and how it played out, it only made sense that the book and movie were nothing alike. The really only similarity was the characters themselves and the animals in them. In my other reviews I mentioned the character Dogson and how hia character was ruined in the movies. In the second book he goes to the island and it wouldn't of made sense in this movie. There was only lost potential and another thing that hurt this movie. Overall, The Lost World Jurassic Park was one of my favorite movies when I was little. It still holds up today but still lacks in characters. The action and dinosaurs were fun to look at and were top notch for its time but it wasn't enough to be memorable. I went into this movie wanting more then what I got. I wish they sacrificed some of the action scenes for more character interactions, especially with Roland. There were few glimpses of brilliance but the lack of time spent on characters is the reason I give The Lost World Jurassic Park the WillyT Recommendation. It is a great movie that should be seen at least once. I can watch it every now and then but it isn't as memorable as I'd hoped. It is still a solid film and is a worthy sequel to the classic that was released a few years earlier.

    I hadn't saw The Lost World: Jurassic Park in theaters as I did the 1st installment JP. I still enjoyed the sequel, but maybe it was just as well I saw it on video. The storyline is a fuse of Aliens meets Godzilla. It's similarities to Aliens is pretty pronounced -- same "monster/alien versus man", with corporate profit-focused greedy entities and egos skewing decision-making to make innocent protagonist's lives even more miserable. And the ensuing drama plays out for our entertainment. Throw in the "we-are-surrounded, all-systems-are-down, and-we-must-survive-another-2-days before-the-rescue-team-arrives" clich&eacute; for good measure. The only thing missing is a face-hugger or chest-burst scene. I will give credit for some exciting nail-biter scenes. Some scenes however, are drawn out way too long, almost to a tortured length for suspense. It's never good when the scenes are so long you want to swear at the characters for being so klutzy, stupid or incompetent, and just get on with it already. The Jurassic Park series of movies are based on Michael Crichton's book, which is quite dark. I had a feeling Spielberg didn't know how to approach JP, in terms of the level of violence. It just seemed Spielberg wanted to make a kid-friendly movie with dinosaurs, with a little entertainment thrown in for fun. I'm sure it's a dilemma every director/studio must contend with: Do we have gratuitous violence in the movie, get an R-rating and make less box-office money? Or do we bastardize and water-down the book, leave out scenes entirely, and play up the kid-friendly nature of the violent story-line? It would seem Spielberg went with the latter. JP had a PG rating, which for many parents was an inappropriate rating for kids. Could you imagine Aliens with a PG rating? I won't open this can of worms here, but there is something to be said for how movies are rated, and whether there is politics and, of course, money involved. Me thinks this was the case for JP. Even the name of the movie was misleading to maximize movie goer attendance. How many times have you heard a mother ask her kids "Who wants to go to the park?!" Going to see "Jurassic Park" seemed so natural to take your kids, right?? TLW goes a little darker than JP. And appropriately, is designated a PG-13 rating. It would seem they were still struggling to make this dark story palatable for the widest audience possible. But let's face it, many scenes you will witness water running red with blood. Or human limbs being torn apart with big teeth. Not very far off from Aliensjust minus the chest-burster. I wasn't going to mention this, but it would be a shame NOT to mention it: In the movie, Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Ian Malcolm) has a black daughter. I think that statement is almost an internet meme now. There is no explanation for it, but casting like that does trigger some head-scratching. If there was a black couple that had an Asian daughter, it would be equally as curious -- you would want to know the background story. And judging from the amount of chatter about this topic, I would say casting like that does a disservice to the story line -- It only serves to distract. Case in point: I recall watching "The Matrix Reloaded" with an Asian friend. After the movie she mentioned there weren't enough Asians in the film. Let's be honest -- there were many Asians cast in TMR, but she argued there "weren't enough". Did she notice anything else about the movie? How about the lighting? The cinematography? The dialog and script writing? The editing? Character development? Nope. She was focused on counting the ratio of Asians, Indians, blacks and whites cast in each role. Oy. Near the end of TLW, Spielberg pays homage to Godzilla, replete with Japanese men running for their lives down a city street. My Asian friend would approve. As would VelociRaptors who were well represented throughout the film. The only group I could see complaining about the movie are the T-Rex, as I'm sure they are fed up being stereotyped and judged as blood-thirsty killers. Over and out.

    Let me just say that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park trilogy. This one was the first that I saw, and even now, I enjoy watching it. Sure, it's not as mind-blowing as Jurassic Park, but The Lost World is a great movie on it's own, even if there are some noticeable flaws. True, every scene is a setup for the next dinosaur attack, sure a velociraptor being knocked out by gymnastics is beyond stupid, and yeah, Sam Neill and Laura Dern are not in this movie, but there are a lot more positives concerning this movie than there are negatives. First of all, I'm glad Jeff Goldblum's character Ian Malcolm was given the lead, because this time around we really got to know him better and he was a lot more serious, mainly because he knows the dangers of facing these dinosaur, and what they're capable of, and Richard Attenborough's cameo as John Hammond was short, but quite a scene-stealing moment, and one of the most endearing moments from the entire film. The new actors(Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, etc) were good, and this is the only movie where I feel like Vince Vaughn showed how good of an actor he is. One complaint that is just stupid is that people complained that Jurassic Park didn't show enough dinosaurs, but when Spielberg showed more in The Lost World, they complained that it was too much. Now about the special effects, the dinosaurs look even better than they did in the first film, because it had been 4 years, and so obviously the effects would be upgraded, and I know people may disagree, but I really love the T-rex running through the streets of San Diego, and it just brings up the level of excitement. Malcolm's daughter is black, and she's kinda bratty, and I liked Lex and Tim (Hammond's grandchildren) better. They were more fun to watch, and their fear was more believable. Overall, The Lost World is a great movie for thrills and the acting is solid enough to keep you invested, but that doesn't change the fact that Jurassic Park was a better movie, told a better story, and had a much better balance in showing the Dinosaurs as creatures and monsters; while Jurassic Park took an hour to show a dinosaur attack, this movie did it almost immediately in the beginning of the film. Another disappointment is that the Velociraptors are less prominent this time around, but they're just as scary as they were in the first movie. But all in all, this movie is fun and thrilling, and the acting is really good, but it lacks the magic and inspiration that made Jurassic Park amazing. 8/10

    Steven Spielberg returned to direct this sequel,(loosely) based on the Michael Crichton novel that sees Jeff Goldblum returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who is enlisted by John Hammond(Richard Attenborough again) to return to Jurassic Park(though on previously unmentioned Site B) to study the dinosaur population, and also to rescue another team, which includes a former flame of his(played by Julianne Moore). He reluctantly agrees, and after locating her, finds to their disgust that the company INGEN has allowed hunting parties to take place, where big-game hunters(led by Pete Postlethwaite) stalk and kill dinosaurs, though the tables would of course be turned... Good sequel has equally effective F/X and terrifying story, though a few too many characters; the twist toward the end is surprising and entertaining, though some poor editing leaves a big plot hole aboard the discovered freighter...still, a worthy sequel that holds up today.

    The Lost World: Jurassic Park is one of the worst sequels ever when comparing it to the original. The characters are ugly, the story is stupid, the only good things are the things reused again, the effects and the score. When a group of scientist go pack for research, they are unaware of another group of people that have plans of their own that bring mayhem among the group and put more people then we would want in trouble. Now like before, they must get help to leave the island before they are the dinosaurs' dinner. This film brought back Jeff Goldblum, but he is nothing like his character in the first movie and is not good as well as Julianne Moore with the best being Vince Vaughn but he is also just eh. They are lifeless souls, waiting to be dinner and are not heroes but pain in the necks. The film's story is rather silly as the scientist roam free so the other people go hunting for a T-Rex as they want to bring one back to San Diego, but it escapes and starts to eat people there while already almost killing everyone at the park but maybe 5 people. Turns out the dinosaur was mad because it wanted its baby, but how did it know it would be hear? The two good things I can pick up from this movie are the effects and score. It was as good as the first, but it's not good enough to help the film. Spielberg has made only one movie that I completely dislike and that's a shame since it could have been good, but we can only hope that it will get better or stop here. Me: D+

    Considered one of Steven Spielberg's worst films, "Jurassic Park: The Lost World" is also considered to be the worst film in the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. While the film does fail with some aspects of the film, it also has its strengths and brings new ideas to the "Jurassic Park" franchise. "Jurassic Park" is one of the films that I see that does not need to have a main antagonist. There are some films I feel like that where it is done well like "Aliens" or "Platoon", but "The Lost World" does not do this. The main antagonist of Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) is a stereotypical businessman who has no idea of what to do. While John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) was like this in the first film, he was not a stereotype, let alone an antagonist. The only thing done right is that he is the opposite of Hammond, being in it for the money while Hammond was in it just to bring something new to people. With the main antagonist comes the problem with the main character, Ian Malcolm. I have no problem with Jeff Goldblum and I loved the character in both the novelizations of "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World" and the first film. This is still the case with this movie but I do not think that Malcolm is a good main character. In the first movie, he was more of a foil character to oppose Hammond instead of someone who was main character material. Also, he still seems to be the designated guy who brings the comic relief. While I was okay with that in the first film, he should not of been like that this much when he was a main character. There were a lot of things I liked, though, as well. The characters are still somewhat interesting as opposed to the blank slates they are in "Jurassic Park III". Plus, the dinosaurs are fleshed out a little as shown being caring parents and not just giant monsters. Along with the fleshing out of the dinosaurs, there is another aspect of the film that I like involving the dinosaurs. The herbivores are dangerous, like they would be in real life which is glossed over in the first and second film. Stegosaurus attack Sarah, a Pachycephalosaurus attacks the mercenaries cars, and the herbivores trash the mercenaries camp. Yes, it is more of a dinosaur attack film but it does show us more of how the animals really would be and not the simple herbivores are nice and safe while the carnivores are mean and dangerous like the other two films do. Taking the pros with the cons, I liked this film and found that it was a good addition to the "Jurassic Park" trilogy. The effects were good, the story was interesting, and the action was superb and tense. While there are some pretty big flaws with the characters, they do not hurt the film a lot.

    Not quite as good as the first one only because several of the first movie cast was not in it. Sam Neill, Laura Dern are two that come to mind. This is still an excellent movie. Jeff Golblum is back as Doctor Ian Malcolm and does his usual good job. His character is still insightful and more importantly he still gets some humorous lines as well. Julianne Moore plays a very tunnel vision doctor that is more interested in the animals than in her own survival, at least at times. One of the not so good guys that are also on this island if the hunter played by Pete Postlethwaite. He is there for the protection but his personal objective is to bag a big one. Well it turns out he gets bagged.

    The first thing to know about 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is that it's not as good as 'Jurassic Park', which is a very high standard to reach. As a young boy, I had reservations about this movie, but it's actually started to slowly grow on me more over time. People may find this strange because of the huge amount of hate towards this film, but I find there's still merit to be found. Story: After a family on a yacht cruise discovers Isla Sorna, the factory floor island owned by InGen, and their daughter is attacked by a pack of compies, John Hammond is removed as CEO of InGen by his greedy nephew Peter Ludlow. Hammond summons Ian Malcolm, now scarred by experiences in Jurassic Park, and asks him to lead an expedition to document the dinosaurs (at a distance from the carnivores) to earn the government's protection. After discovering his girlfriend, Sarah Harding, is already there, Malcolm joins Nick Van Owen and Eddie Carr and sails to the island. Ludlow arrives with a taskforce led by Roland Tembo capture the dinosaurs and take them to San Diego to flaunt them in a zoo. At night, Nick sabotages the InGen camp and brings an injured baby T-Rex to their trailer to patch it's leg up after Roland had captured to bait the father Rex. The T-Rex parents soon retrieve the infant and push the trailer over a cliff, and Eddie is killed trying to save Malcolm and team before InGen arrives to help them out. Both stranded teams concede to join forces to get off the island. The film culminates in a fun (if divisive) 15-minute sequence when the male T-Rex rampages through San Diego searching for his infant, paying homage to 'King Kong' and 1925's 'The Lost World'. One key problem most people have with "The Lost World" is that it's not as filled with wonder as the original, and this film certainly could have benefited from more scenes with the herbivores and characters enjoying the island ambiance. Judging by some unrealistic moments and plot holes, such as the way the trailer fell or the scene where Malcolm's daughter is able to defeat a Raptor with gymnastics, and the fact that the crew of the ship holding the Rex was killed with no clue as to how it happened, Spielberg was not fully committed to this film, which is a real shame. The build-up is also fairly slow, but can be skipped. Personally, the infamous gymnastic scene just makes me chuckle, it's not worth getting angry over. And I admit that I relished in the Rex's travels in San Diego and his reunion with the once-again captured infant. Another major criticism is that main characters cause more death and destruction than the InGen team, and that is partially true. Sarah cannot seem to keep away from dangerous dinosaurs in the field and can be annoying at times, but she still helps lead the T-Rex away from civilians in San Diego. However, Nick is just awful; he's a self- righteous environmentalist whose actions include releasing the captive dinosaurs on the InGen team and stealing the bullets from Roland's rifle to prevent the T-Rex from being killed, thus putting more people in danger. Frankly, I regard him as a hidden antagonist responsible for the chaos, thankfully he's absent from the San Diego sequence. Ultimately, the lack of defined heroes and villains feels more in keeping with the grimness of Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park novel, which was very cynical, and potentially disconcerting to certain people. In this movie's defence, some characters do stand out in a positive light; Ian Malcolm is just as eccentric and witty as ever if more cynical (Jeff Goldblum an acquired taste, really). Another worthy character is Eddie Carr, who is killed by the T-Rexes in the act of saving Malcolm, Sarah and Nick. Hammond's brief appearances were a delight to watch, and the character Roland Tembo is a bold, tactical hunter with an air of dignity and passion that earned my respect as an anti-heroic figure. It isn't really an environmental film so much as one about attaining compromise between two dangerous extremes, personified by Roland and Nick. Another theme is failure to treat what you create with responsibility, as seen with InGen's haughty regard for the dinosaurs as financial assets and not real animals, rather like Frankenstein's negligence towards his creation. Taking the dinosaurs to the mainland zoo would have been disastrous, as Crichton's underlying belief that humans and dinosaurs don't mix is still present. It's also worth remembering that this is a movie of dinosaurs in the wild so there will be higher danger than on the theme park island. I personally find it appealing that we can see the dinosaurs out in the wild simply being dinosaurs, especially the parental instincts of the T- Rexes. The dark, primordial atmosphere of Isla Sorna, accompanied by John Williams' excellent jungle-themed score, does instil a sense that you are in the midst of the dinosaurs' domain, with a few reprisals of the original themes. The CGI dinosaurs look better than most CG creatures today; their behaviour feels genuine, much like real animals, especially with the scenes involving a herd of Stegosaurus and the scenes with the T-Rexes. The animatronics are just as sharp and engaging as the first film, from a technical standpoint, it's well crafted. Ultimately, "The Lost World" is an enjoyable, if reckless, survival film that gives the incredible dinosaurs of InGen a visceral return. Spielberg's style holds it up as an advancement of the Jurassic Park universe. There are plenty of thrills, engrossing action scenes, and a dark and wild atmosphere that could have been helped by more moments of wonder. I certainly wouldn't call this Spielberg's worst movie. Despite being dwarfed by its grander predecessor, it's a fun movie, if flawed.

    (Reviewed on the basis of watching on video 16 years after release) Plot: Ian Malcolm learns about the existence of Site B, Isla Sorna which was the breeding place of all the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park and they are still flourishing there! John Hammond sends a team, headed by Malcolm to the island to gather more information where they encounter another team out to capture the animals. What dangers await them in this 'lost world'? Review: Steven Spielberg films, as I have learned, are meant to be lifelong experiences which curve out a permanent niche in the viewer's hearts. They take us on a journey of a life-time in a trivial period of 120 minutes. Although I am in no position to comment on Spielberg's filmography; having watched just two other masterpieces of the maestro: Jurassic Park and Jaws. But those two films were exactly that- lifetime experiences! Sadly, 'The Lost World' hardly falls in that category. Sequels always have the burden of expectations (especially if the original is a near-perfect classic like Jurassic Park); but one expected better than this. Spielberg himself had requested Michael Crichton to write his literary sequel on which this film sequel is based. It seemed inexplicable as to why the mesmerizing Allan Grant, hero of the original, was replaced by Ian Malcolm who hardly featured in the second half. Crichton possibly felt it unjustified as Malcolm had a more heroic role in his novel and decided to give him his due here (by even miraculously reviving him after his supposed death in the book). The film starts off well promising more thrills at the prospect of only a few people in a dinosaur infested island; with no fences this time. But after a rather tiring build-up, when the team reaches the island they witness the arrival of another team out to capture dinosaurs. Riding on armed vehicles (including motor bikes) they trap the animals almost as a matter of joke. Hunting a jackal would probably be more difficult! The ridiculous ease with which the animals are captured dilutes the whole tension of the film. Even when the animals break-free; the sequence appears more funny than terrifying. Even in JP the real tension had begun post-intermission; but the first half was much more engrossing than here. There the debates, the character interactions and the whole arrangement hooked our attention without much sight of the 'main attractions'. Here we are exposed to a wide range of fauna; but yet the charm is missing with only the Hammond- Malcolm interaction standing out as a debate. Things improve in the second half but unlike just a handful of people in JP; the presence of a large human contingent prevents the generation of much fear (especially having seen their daredevilry earlier). But halfway into the second half, just when the excitement is at its peak, the survivors are whisked away in a helicopter; killing all the tension in an instant. Although more fun was yet to come (thank God!), it was in stark contrast to JP where the excitement had continued to rise culminating in a grand crescendo in the end. The plot has a lot of deviations from the novel, and probably in doing so developed a lot of glaring loopholes. The sequel raises questions about some developments from the first film itself besides having disputes of its own:- 1) If the animals were bred in Site B; then why was the embryo storage located in Site A from where Dennis Nedry stole them? 2) Similarly, it was shown that the velociraptors were artificially hatched in the Site A lab. Was any exception made for not breeding raptors in Site B? Then how could the raptors come into existence there? 3) The lysine deficiency expectedly resulted in the death of all Site A animals. Yet why it didn't apply to Site B was one of the main questions for the team. But it remained unanswered throughout the film. Maybe the script-writer just forgot about it; for was it tough to imagine any explanation like maybe the endemic vegetation of the island was the reason behind it. 4) The justification given by Hammond as to raise public support by furnishing pictures is outrageous. Wouldn't the public be more eager to watch these animals in a zoo? 5) All carnivores were supposed to be in the middle of the island. But in the opening sequence, the compsognathus were seen roaming in herds near the beach. 6) There was no such accident in Site B, unlike Site A. Then why was the radio system along with a bunch of cars left to degrade in the island? 7) How did the T-Rex get trapped underneath the deck of the ship which was bringing it to US, after having killed all the crew above? But the film certainly has its moments. None better, than the tremendous rescue sequence resulting in the terribly tragic death of Eddie. It almost brought me to tears! Plus, the T-Rex chase, the raptor encounters and the ship-crash are the other highlights of the film. There is an element of King Kong in the climax which is good. But is it so easy to drive out a dinosaur within an hour or so? Also, a single dinosaur surrounded by infinite people spells much less fear than the reverse. Jeff Goldblum reprises Malcolm without the old mannerisms. He appears dapper (like a hero should); but the two previous T-Rex encounters have turned him sober from the 'rock-star' avatar, as was described by Hammond. There's hardly much character-interactions this time, except the touching father-daughter relationship. While Jurassic Park was an ultimate cinematic experience; The Lost World is just another good entertainer. But the ending, displaying the dinosaurs with Hammond's speech was masterful. All's well that end's well; but it's still not the end. The dinosaurs will be back; this time with my favorite Sam Neill as Allan Grant; in Jurassic Park III!

    The Lost World, the first sequel to 1993's Jurassic Park is an exhausting, thinly scripted film, that depends entirely on it's action sequences and special effects. Now that I've got the critique out of the way, let me just say that I had a blast watching The Lost World, the rare sequel that improves on the original. The Lost World may be missing some of the majesty and inventiveness of it's predecessor, but The Lost World is more fun, and the dinos are just as thrilling the second time around. 4 unfortunate souls make the dangerous decision to go to Isla Sorna to observe and document the dinosaurs living on the island. Among those five are Ian Malcolm, who had been to the island before, and had been nearly killed as a result of the reptilian beasts. He's hesitant to return, but his mind is made up when he discovers his girl friend, Sarah, is already at the island. And the plot thickens further when it's discovered that one of Ian's daughters, Kelly, manages to stow away to the treacherous place. And when the group discovers that a rival team of considerably more people have also shown up on the island (with more greedy plans in mind), it doesn't take long for the dinosaurs to show their faces. It hardly matters why these individuals have decided to come back to Jurassic Park. The plot is thin, so we're hardly given reasons for why this ill-fated group are choosing to set foot on the island. The obvious lack of story and the forced nature of this sequel is bothersome initially. But once the ball gets rolling, it's nothing but sheer entertainment value. Like the original, The Lost World has a painfully slow start. Obligatory appearances of cast members from the first film and some echoes of John Williams iconic score is all there is to entertain one during the first while. And an awful lot of talking. Seriously, for a film with so little plot, I'm not sure why so much time had to be spent in discussion. At any rate, the fun starts much sooner in this film. The pace picks up a bit about 40 minutes in, but right around the 50 minute mark, The Lost World fires all cylinders and doesn't look bad. Utterly terrifying and remarkably suspenseful, I had a big silly grin on my face for a majority of the action. Admittedly, The Lost World has a few gimmicks. For one, there are two Tyrannosaurs this time around. Twice the dinos means twice the fun, right? Well, not necessarily, but the added dinos were certainly welcome. Don't like being scared? This film isn't for you. Don't like seeing people in horrifying peril? This film isn't for you. Do you insist on some emotional depth or intellectual stimulation when you watch an action flick? Then once again, this film probably isn't for you. But if you kick back and relax, and just turn off your brain, this is one wild ride. Still, the run time is a bit excessive. The Lost World lasts 2 hours and 10 minutes, and I was left pretty exhausted after the first 100 minutes. So while the last half hour is perfectly thrilling, and still plenty of fun, it also felt a bit unnecessary, and a bit tacked on. The characters, like the original, aren't particularly developed. After all, they're not the main attraction here. But for the most part, they're likable when they need to be, and unlikeable when they need to be (though there are exceptions...). The acting is unimpressive, but serviceable. The actors only need to use some big words to describe the equipment they're using, and be able to show obvious signs of terror. As a result, the actors easily fit into their roles, though I couldn't help but hope for more impressive performances considering the talented players here; Jeff Goldblum, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, etc. Richard Attenborough brings plenty of charm to his character though, reprising his role as John Hammond from the original. Still, his part he is extremely small. The special effects has held up well. They look just as good as the ground breaking effects in the original (though they're not quite as innovative the second time around). With more dinosaurs this time around, and more complex action sequences, the special effects team likely had their hands full. It all looks great, though. John William's score, while lacking the iconic nature and grand scale of the original, is still good enough. It's certainly by-the-numbers Williams (and his new theme is completely forgettable), but it still manages to capture the spirit of the film. And fragments of the original themes do find their way into the film, so listen for them. This being my second visit to Jurassic Park, I knew what to expect. Lots of dinosaurs, moments of awe at the beginning, moments of terror everywhere after that, and stupid humans thinking they can control it all. I even made a few light-hearted attempts at guessing those who wouldn't live to see the end credits (I actually got most of my guesses right). But that may be the biggest issue for some; The Lost World doesn't do much to differentiate itself from the original. Still, considering how much fun the original was, that didn't bother me too much.

    Michael Crichton wrote a sequel to his bestselling book Jurassic Park with The Lost World Jurassic Park. Once again Crichton worked with Spielberg to put The Lost World on the big screen. Jeff Goldblum returns with a cast of interesting characters as he goes to a second island where the dinosaurs live free. There are no fences and you can only imagine what happens before you actually see it. I hate to compare the first to the second move but everybody knows I loved the first but not so much the second. Like Anaconda I lived it as a kid because the site of dinosaurs eating people was awesome, but now that I'm older I appreciate characters and relationships etc. What Jurassic Park had in story and characters lacked in The Lost World but The Lost World had the action and excitement that lacked in Jurassic Park. You may ask why Ian Malcolm would revisit the world of dinosaurs and the answer is quite simple. Hammond's company, InGen wants to go to the island and take an animal back to San Diego and put it in a zoo. Hammond sent Malcolm's girlfriend, who happens to be a paleontologist, to the island alone so Malcolm goes to rescue her. The characters and story could have been terrific. Eddie Carr was a great character, Vince Vaughn is in the movie and he gives a really good performance early in his career, and I especially loved the character of Roland. Roland is a hunter who is looking for the ultimate bounty. He is an important character that is underrated. His character could have been so much more and every time he was starting to be built up they cut to a dinosaur eating a smaller character. He was a character I wanted to know about. The movie should have focused on characters like him and the guy with the beard and long hair. He is a dinosaur genius and he has such little screen time. That is the huge flaw in the movie, it is focused too much on the dinosaurs eating people and not enough in the story and its characters. Ian Malcolm was one of the best characters in the 90s and in The Lost World he lost his edge. The snarky comments and brilliance he once had was nowhere to be seen. He had moments of brilliance but he was rewritten as a different character in a way. That was really the only thing that hurt the movie and made it worse than the original. Sequels aren't supposed to be better than the original but the actual dinosaurs and the action scenes were amazing. I could watch the trailer on the cliff scene with the T-Rex over and over again. The CGI and special effects put into the dinosaurs, along with the life size robots were astounding. What lacked in real character development was made up for in the work in the animals themselves. Each dinosaur had its scene to shine and there were a lot more different species. I love the stegosaurus and the Compys. They each had their scenes and some were better than the others but all great. The Compys were a big part of the first book and were not in the movie but I'm glad they found their way into the second one. They are real scavengers and make an impact in the movie. Spielberg and Crichton nail the raptors once again, possibly even better this time. It focused less on the intelligence and more on the ferocity of the animals this time. That could be better because if they focused on intelligence again it could be a little redundant. They appear a little late in the film but they really change it. They look a little different and I'm glad they weren't used simply for killing off all the extras. Then there is the final few scenes, and boy did they not disappoint. It was awesome but at the same time it kind of ruined the lore of Jurassic Park. A major part of the second island is that it is kept secret and nobody knows about it. Without spoiling the ending I'll just say the secret is out, and that's a shame. The book was a great read but after the first movie and how it played out, it only made sense that the book and movie were nothing alike. The really only similarity was the characters themselves and the animals in them. In my other reviews I mentioned the character Dogson and how hia character was ruined in the movies. In the second book he goes to the island and it wouldn't of made sense in this movie. There was only lost potential and another thing that hurt this movie. Overall, The Lost World Jurassic Park was one of my favorite movies when I was little. It still holds up today but still lacks in characters. The action and dinosaurs were fun to look at and were top notch for its time but it wasn't enough to be memorable. I went into this movie wanting more then what I got. I wish they sacrificed some of the action scenes for more character interactions, especially with Roland. There were few glimpses of brilliance but the lack of time spent on characters is the reason I give The Lost World Jurassic Park the WillyT Recommendation. It is a great movie that should be seen at least once. I can watch it every now and then but it isn't as memorable as I'd hoped. It is still a solid film and is a worthy sequel to the classic that was released a few years earlier.

    I hadn't saw The Lost World: Jurassic Park in theaters as I did the 1st installment JP. I still enjoyed the sequel, but maybe it was just as well I saw it on video. The storyline is a fuse of Aliens meets Godzilla. It's similarities to Aliens is pretty pronounced -- same "monster/alien versus man", with corporate profit-focused greedy entities and egos skewing decision-making to make innocent protagonist's lives even more miserable. And the ensuing drama plays out for our entertainment. Throw in the "we-are-surrounded, all-systems-are-down, and-we-must-survive-another-2-days before-the-rescue-team-arrives" clich&eacute; for good measure. The only thing missing is a face-hugger or chest-burst scene. I will give credit for some exciting nail-biter scenes. Some scenes however, are drawn out way too long, almost to a tortured length for suspense. It's never good when the scenes are so long you want to swear at the characters for being so klutzy, stupid or incompetent, and just get on with it already. The Jurassic Park series of movies are based on Michael Crichton's book, which is quite dark. I had a feeling Spielberg didn't know how to approach JP, in terms of the level of violence. It just seemed Spielberg wanted to make a kid-friendly movie with dinosaurs, with a little entertainment thrown in for fun. I'm sure it's a dilemma every director/studio must contend with: Do we have gratuitous violence in the movie, get an R-rating and make less box-office money? Or do we bastardize and water-down the book, leave out scenes entirely, and play up the kid-friendly nature of the violent story-line? It would seem Spielberg went with the latter. JP had a PG rating, which for many parents was an inappropriate rating for kids. Could you imagine Aliens with a PG rating? I won't open this can of worms here, but there is something to be said for how movies are rated, and whether there is politics and, of course, money involved. Me thinks this was the case for JP. Even the name of the movie was misleading to maximize movie goer attendance. How many times have you heard a mother ask her kids "Who wants to go to the park?!" Going to see "Jurassic Park" seemed so natural to take your kids, right?? TLW goes a little darker than JP. And appropriately, is designated a PG-13 rating. It would seem they were still struggling to make this dark story palatable for the widest audience possible. But let's face it, many scenes you will witness water running red with blood. Or human limbs being torn apart with big teeth. Not very far off from Aliensjust minus the chest-burster. I wasn't going to mention this, but it would be a shame NOT to mention it: In the movie, Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Ian Malcolm) has a black daughter. I think that statement is almost an internet meme now. There is no explanation for it, but casting like that does trigger some head-scratching. If there was a black couple that had an Asian daughter, it would be equally as curious -- you would want to know the background story. And judging from the amount of chatter about this topic, I would say casting like that does a disservice to the story line -- It only serves to distract. Case in point: I recall watching "The Matrix Reloaded" with an Asian friend. After the movie she mentioned there weren't enough Asians in the film. Let's be honest -- there were many Asians cast in TMR, but she argued there "weren't enough". Did she notice anything else about the movie? How about the lighting? The cinematography? The dialog and script writing? The editing? Character development? Nope. She was focused on counting the ratio of Asians, Indians, blacks and whites cast in each role. Oy. Near the end of TLW, Spielberg pays homage to Godzilla, replete with Japanese men running for their lives down a city street. My Asian friend would approve. As would VelociRaptors who were well represented throughout the film. The only group I could see complaining about the movie are the T-Rex, as I'm sure they are fed up being stereotyped and judged as blood-thirsty killers. Over and out.

    Let me just say that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park trilogy. This one was the first that I saw, and even now, I enjoy watching it. Sure, it's not as mind-blowing as Jurassic Park, but The Lost World is a great movie on it's own, even if there are some noticeable flaws. True, every scene is a setup for the next dinosaur attack, sure a velociraptor being knocked out by gymnastics is beyond stupid, and yeah, Sam Neill and Laura Dern are not in this movie, but there are a lot more positives concerning this movie than there are negatives. First of all, I'm glad Jeff Goldblum's character Ian Malcolm was given the lead, because this time around we really got to know him better and he was a lot more serious, mainly because he knows the dangers of facing these dinosaur, and what they're capable of, and Richard Attenborough's cameo as John Hammond was short, but quite a scene-stealing moment, and one of the most endearing moments from the entire film. The new actors(Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, etc) were good, and this is the only movie where I feel like Vince Vaughn showed how good of an actor he is. One complaint that is just stupid is that people complained that Jurassic Park didn't show enough dinosaurs, but when Spielberg showed more in The Lost World, they complained that it was too much. Now about the special effects, the dinosaurs look even better than they did in the first film, because it had been 4 years, and so obviously the effects would be upgraded, and I know people may disagree, but I really love the T-rex running through the streets of San Diego, and it just brings up the level of excitement. Malcolm's daughter is black, and she's kinda bratty, and I liked Lex and Tim (Hammond's grandchildren) better. They were more fun to watch, and their fear was more believable. Overall, The Lost World is a great movie for thrills and the acting is solid enough to keep you invested, but that doesn't change the fact that Jurassic Park was a better movie, told a better story, and had a much better balance in showing the Dinosaurs as creatures and monsters; while Jurassic Park took an hour to show a dinosaur attack, this movie did it almost immediately in the beginning of the film. Another disappointment is that the Velociraptors are less prominent this time around, but they're just as scary as they were in the first movie. But all in all, this movie is fun and thrilling, and the acting is really good, but it lacks the magic and inspiration that made Jurassic Park amazing. 8/10
