    "The Storyteller" is Hector's therapist. Think.... Dr. Phil gets all ginned up on Robert Bly and Joseph Campbell and attempts to help his patient understand the irrationality of their 'flight response' to life's problems through understanding the old adage that 'there is nothing having befallen you but that which is common to man'. Problem solved, movie makes sense. A lovely, beautiful, heartfelt film from a writer/director who refuses to take the cheap and easy route of magical realism to show the actual achievability of joy in daily life. We miss you Bill. Just screened 'Housekeeping' for my college bound daughter, she loved it so much that I bought an old VHS of this title for her Christmas stocking and couldn't resist a viewing. Maybe you need to be 46 and ('a-hem') fully experienced in order to appreciate it suitably.(?) The 'Director's Cut' would undoubtedly be a "10"- hint, hint...

    The life you live will be the same over and over again. You will repeat your lessons again and again in various forms until you have learned them. After learning it, there's evolution and wisdom. This is what can be said about this film except that it presents its stories without having this sort of spiritual value. It brings this idea of the eternal returning throughout this main character but it is developed almost like a fairy tale taken out of a children's book. Travelling through different countries and periods of time, going from the Celts cavemen to the modern New York businessman, "Being Human" has Robin Williams playing a character named Hector and his appearances in distinct centuries trying to learn what means to be an human being. In the five short stories created here, Hector, living as an Celtic in the highlands, had his wife and children taken away by barbarians; was the slave of a dumb master (John Turturro) in a more civilized era; an married man who fell in love with an foreign woman, a few centuries later; a military during the Portugual's Maritime Expansion on Africa, conquering new lands and new treasures; and as troubled divorced man trying to reconciliate with his children of whom he hasn't seen since the end of his marriage. The movie fails in being real or accurate enough in all of the stories except in the last one which is very close to us. Slow, of mannered delivery and hardly getting better as the stories unfold, "Being Human" is the kind of film that really follows its lessons, it'll only grow on you after countless views. In my case four attempts, of these in two I fell asleep (but always believing that there was something interesting there), one in which I watched the whole thing and didn't like and the last one in which my perception changed and end up being a good film, far from being a masterpiece that it could be. So, you'll have to watch this film over and over until you get something from it, then you can evolve into really saying if this is a good or a bad film. This whole idea of a man trapped in strange and quite horrendous situations where every kind of decision ruin his life but always running to something else thinking it'll be better and lead him to a good life, was brilliantly presented in a book called "The Star Rover" by Jack London. In it, the main character is a prisoner that can recall his past lives as a way of escaping from his current pain of being tortured. But in those lives things don't get any better and he's always getting into more and more trouble. "Being Human" falls as an pretentious art film with symbolisms that never work and stories that are difficult to be involved with. Luckily, they have Williams as a main actor and we root for him whatever the Hector he's playing. We care for Hector in all of his situations because there's something there that is involving enough to make us imagining what kind of decisions we would make if we were him. In at least, one of the stories you'll put yourself into Hector's shoes. Won't blame director/writer Bill Forsyth for the flaws presented here since this is not his original project, Warner Bros. forced him to cut the film and include an narration that is quite excessive and too much explanatory. The narration (provided by Theresa Russell) of a film destined to grown up's treats its audience as children, explaining many things we're seeing on the screen. It ruined some parts of the film. Result: poor criticism, an box-office failure and now who knows this film? I sincerely hope that one day Forsyth come out of the shadows and show to the world this film in its integrity in a director's cut DVD (even the known version is hard to find). The things that attracted me into "Being Human" are the quality of the performances, not only Williams but also Turturro, Lorraine Bracco, Hector Elizondo, Jonathan Hyde, Anna Galiena, William H. Macy among others; the beautiful cinematography; Michael Gibbs fantastic musical score (specially the music presented when the movie enters into the 20th Century, an highly agitated theme). The story, at times, knows how to hold our interest but only for those who have an open mind to accept the concept of a man living over and over a similar life that bears only difference of costumes and periods of time. Hector's conditions and the way love acts in his life are quite the same, yet he fails to learn something from these experiences. Very problematic but not enough to make you feel bad about it, "Being Human" comes as a good film about valuable and noble lessons that sometimes crosses our paths in this long journey of life. 7/10

    I loved the movie. I think that most people that saw it did not understand what it was about. I believe it is about reincarnation or possibly parallel universes. I believe that the promoters of the movie missed the boat by not advertising it as such, probably believing that it would turn people off. I think that if people knew this going into the movie they would see it in a completely different light. I also think that many people were expecting it to be Robin Williams usual comedic type of movie and so missed the point of the movie waiting for it to be funny. I too, really enjoy his comedy, but he is also a very intense and great actor and has shown his versatility with his many different types of characters and movies. I have seen the movie several times and still find new and interesting things in it. I am still watching and waiting patiently for it to come out on DVD.

    Only reason it didn't get a 9 is that I have a hard time with Robin Williams playing serious roles (sorry). "Isomnia" was one of his better serious roles. But he is very sympathetic in this movie. And the movie itself is very near perfect. A great story. I came to IMDb to check on this title as I couldn't find it on Netflix. Shame on Netflix!

    I never had the feeling that this film was intended to make the top 10 list of anyone. However, it remains one of my favorite movies. I though each story (life time) was very well done and offers a very real feel of lives of a soul through the ages. Most of my friends missed the point of this film, but the reside of the surface of life and cannot see through the veil. I have seen this movies at least five times over the years and each time I am fascinated by it. I will probably see it many more times. It is not a movie for everyone, it doesn't involve violence, and only a hint of sex, and therefore, it is tossed aside. I still see it as a gem.

    In one of his serious roles sans beard, Robin Williams stars in this somewhat confusing movie about a man portrayed in five different stories, always trying to find meaning in life...or something. Maybe the movie was trying to make a point about something, but I couldn't really tell. In a way, it almost seems like they made the movie for fun and just stacked the whole thing with a giant cast. Director Bill Forsyth, who had a very clear goal in making "Local Hero", seems somewhat confused himself here. I should identify that I didn't hate "Being Human". It's an interesting look at world history. It's just hard to get a grip on the movie. An OK way to pass time, but I wouldn't recommend making it your first choice. Also starring Theresa Russell, Robert Carlyle, John Turturro, Vincent D'Onofrio, Jonathan Hyde, Hector Elizondo, Ewan McGregor (in his debut) and William H. Macy.

    Well, lets see. aha ha, right, Being Human. Well lets start with saying that this was the most outrageously boring film in the entire world. I would rather eat popcorn staring at the wall at home. Robin Williams is my favorite actor, but this is my least favorite movie. It started so peaceful, the trailer was nice, the cover was interesting, but the movie was like walking through thick goo, it takes you ages to get through, and you are not comfortable. Now what a movie ay? If you want a story, read a book. There was not much music, practically no good effects or camera moves. Costumes were alright, the dialogue was good but tedious, and plus, no real excitement through the whole thing. Lets just say, it is a bit different hmm? The story is meaningfu but i would understand it more on a book. While you watch it, you don't concentrate on the movie but the things around you. You start counting your teeth, or the tiles on the floor. You bite your nails and do whatever you do when bored (e.g. eat). It is truly a movie for your home with a hot meal and while its raining. But, watch it anyway, it may be appealing to you, but no matter what happens, prepare for a sleepy adventure!!!!!

    I got to see this for the third time at the Glasgow Film Theatre, with Bill Forsyth speaking about it. What treat! He calls this one of the most expensive art films ever made. It was intended to be even more abstract and mysterious than it is. He had big problems with the studio/ producers wanting it to be easier to understand and more mainstream accessible - hence the slightly awkward voice-over. Too bad it is not successful enough to warrant a Director's Cut. You can never get a 2nd chance at a first impression, but I would love to see it as Bill Forsyth intended. I expect it would be even more powerful. Robin Williams is great. It really is a good film, but don't expect a laugh-a-minute or anything Hollywood. Because of the changes that the studio insisted upon it inhabits some kind of strange middle ground.

    Dear Movie Fans, I am a huge R. Williams fan so for me this was a treat... I watched this movie by accident while waiting for an extended repair on my car.. anyway it was great...His journey through time had my own imagination going wild...I sat traveling w/him thinking how I would react to these situations...I started to forget it was even Robin Williams in the film as odd as that sounds to some... I was completely sad when this movie ended...from that time on it has been a movie that comforts me when I'm down... please watch if you like both Williams & some soul searching. Psst also check out Mrs Doubtfire for a pick me up ;) Happy Viewing!

    I Love Robin Williams. The Guy is simply Amazing. So when I took my girlfriend to see this Movie in the theater I thought we would both be in for a treat. Instead... we watched a train wreck. Both of us kept looking at each other in disappointment as we started to fall asleep. About 50 Minutes into it we actually walked out. We had to. We Both wanted to! This thing just wasn't getting any better. I have never walked out of a movie in my entire life..... until this movie came on the screen. The Movie "Being Human" is truly Horrible. However I do recommend that you Rent it just so that you can see how horrible it is for yourself. I highly recommend it for people who have trouble falling asleep. When pills won't work..... This movie will.

    "The Storyteller" is Hector's therapist. Think.... Dr. Phil gets all ginned up on Robert Bly and Joseph Campbell and attempts to help his patient understand the irrationality of their 'flight response' to life's problems through understanding the old adage that 'there is nothing having befallen you but that which is common to man'. Problem solved, movie makes sense. A lovely, beautiful, heartfelt film from a writer/director who refuses to take the cheap and easy route of magical realism to show the actual achievability of joy in daily life. We miss you Bill. Just screened 'Housekeeping' for my college bound daughter, she loved it so much that I bought an old VHS of this title for her Christmas stocking and couldn't resist a viewing. Maybe you need to be 46 and ('a-hem') fully experienced in order to appreciate it suitably.(?) The 'Director's Cut' would undoubtedly be a "10"- hint, hint...

    The life you live will be the same over and over again. You will repeat your lessons again and again in various forms until you have learned them. After learning it, there's evolution and wisdom. This is what can be said about this film except that it presents its stories without having this sort of spiritual value. It brings this idea of the eternal returning throughout this main character but it is developed almost like a fairy tale taken out of a children's book. Travelling through different countries and periods of time, going from the Celts cavemen to the modern New York businessman, "Being Human" has Robin Williams playing a character named Hector and his appearances in distinct centuries trying to learn what means to be an human being. In the five short stories created here, Hector, living as an Celtic in the highlands, had his wife and children taken away by barbarians; was the slave of a dumb master (John Turturro) in a more civilized era; an married man who fell in love with an foreign woman, a few centuries later; a military during the Portugual's Maritime Expansion on Africa, conquering new lands and new treasures; and as troubled divorced man trying to reconciliate with his children of whom he hasn't seen since the end of his marriage. The movie fails in being real or accurate enough in all of the stories except in the last one which is very close to us. Slow, of mannered delivery and hardly getting better as the stories unfold, "Being Human" is the kind of film that really follows its lessons, it'll only grow on you after countless views. In my case four attempts, of these in two I fell asleep (but always believing that there was something interesting there), one in which I watched the whole thing and didn't like and the last one in which my perception changed and end up being a good film, far from being a masterpiece that it could be. So, you'll have to watch this film over and over until you get something from it, then you can evolve into really saying if this is a good or a bad film. This whole idea of a man trapped in strange and quite horrendous situations where every kind of decision ruin his life but always running to something else thinking it'll be better and lead him to a good life, was brilliantly presented in a book called "The Star Rover" by Jack London. In it, the main character is a prisoner that can recall his past lives as a way of escaping from his current pain of being tortured. But in those lives things don't get any better and he's always getting into more and more trouble. "Being Human" falls as an pretentious art film with symbolisms that never work and stories that are difficult to be involved with. Luckily, they have Williams as a main actor and we root for him whatever the Hector he's playing. We care for Hector in all of his situations because there's something there that is involving enough to make us imagining what kind of decisions we would make if we were him. In at least, one of the stories you'll put yourself into Hector's shoes. Won't blame director/writer Bill Forsyth for the flaws presented here since this is not his original project, Warner Bros. forced him to cut the film and include an narration that is quite excessive and too much explanatory. The narration (provided by Theresa Russell) of a film destined to grown up's treats its audience as children, explaining many things we're seeing on the screen. It ruined some parts of the film. Result: poor criticism, an box-office failure and now who knows this film? I sincerely hope that one day Forsyth come out of the shadows and show to the world this film in its integrity in a director's cut DVD (even the known version is hard to find). The things that attracted me into "Being Human" are the quality of the performances, not only Williams but also Turturro, Lorraine Bracco, Hector Elizondo, Jonathan Hyde, Anna Galiena, William H. Macy among others; the beautiful cinematography; Michael Gibbs fantastic musical score (specially the music presented when the movie enters into the 20th Century, an highly agitated theme). The story, at times, knows how to hold our interest but only for those who have an open mind to accept the concept of a man living over and over a similar life that bears only difference of costumes and periods of time. Hector's conditions and the way love acts in his life are quite the same, yet he fails to learn something from these experiences. Very problematic but not enough to make you feel bad about it, "Being Human" comes as a good film about valuable and noble lessons that sometimes crosses our paths in this long journey of life. 7/10

    I loved the movie. I think that most people that saw it did not understand what it was about. I believe it is about reincarnation or possibly parallel universes. I believe that the promoters of the movie missed the boat by not advertising it as such, probably believing that it would turn people off. I think that if people knew this going into the movie they would see it in a completely different light. I also think that many people were expecting it to be Robin Williams usual comedic type of movie and so missed the point of the movie waiting for it to be funny. I too, really enjoy his comedy, but he is also a very intense and great actor and has shown his versatility with his many different types of characters and movies. I have seen the movie several times and still find new and interesting things in it. I am still watching and waiting patiently for it to come out on DVD.

    Only reason it didn't get a 9 is that I have a hard time with Robin Williams playing serious roles (sorry). "Isomnia" was one of his better serious roles. But he is very sympathetic in this movie. And the movie itself is very near perfect. A great story. I came to IMDb to check on this title as I couldn't find it on Netflix. Shame on Netflix!

    I never had the feeling that this film was intended to make the top 10 list of anyone. However, it remains one of my favorite movies. I though each story (life time) was very well done and offers a very real feel of lives of a soul through the ages. Most of my friends missed the point of this film, but the reside of the surface of life and cannot see through the veil. I have seen this movies at least five times over the years and each time I am fascinated by it. I will probably see it many more times. It is not a movie for everyone, it doesn't involve violence, and only a hint of sex, and therefore, it is tossed aside. I still see it as a gem.

    In one of his serious roles sans beard, Robin Williams stars in this somewhat confusing movie about a man portrayed in five different stories, always trying to find meaning in life...or something. Maybe the movie was trying to make a point about something, but I couldn't really tell. In a way, it almost seems like they made the movie for fun and just stacked the whole thing with a giant cast. Director Bill Forsyth, who had a very clear goal in making "Local Hero", seems somewhat confused himself here. I should identify that I didn't hate "Being Human". It's an interesting look at world history. It's just hard to get a grip on the movie. An OK way to pass time, but I wouldn't recommend making it your first choice. Also starring Theresa Russell, Robert Carlyle, John Turturro, Vincent D'Onofrio, Jonathan Hyde, Hector Elizondo, Ewan McGregor (in his debut) and William H. Macy.

    Well, lets see. aha ha, right, Being Human. Well lets start with saying that this was the most outrageously boring film in the entire world. I would rather eat popcorn staring at the wall at home. Robin Williams is my favorite actor, but this is my least favorite movie. It started so peaceful, the trailer was nice, the cover was interesting, but the movie was like walking through thick goo, it takes you ages to get through, and you are not comfortable. Now what a movie ay? If you want a story, read a book. There was not much music, practically no good effects or camera moves. Costumes were alright, the dialogue was good but tedious, and plus, no real excitement through the whole thing. Lets just say, it is a bit different hmm? The story is meaningfu but i would understand it more on a book. While you watch it, you don't concentrate on the movie but the things around you. You start counting your teeth, or the tiles on the floor. You bite your nails and do whatever you do when bored (e.g. eat). It is truly a movie for your home with a hot meal and while its raining. But, watch it anyway, it may be appealing to you, but no matter what happens, prepare for a sleepy adventure!!!!!

    I got to see this for the third time at the Glasgow Film Theatre, with Bill Forsyth speaking about it. What treat! He calls this one of the most expensive art films ever made. It was intended to be even more abstract and mysterious than it is. He had big problems with the studio/ producers wanting it to be easier to understand and more mainstream accessible - hence the slightly awkward voice-over. Too bad it is not successful enough to warrant a Director's Cut. You can never get a 2nd chance at a first impression, but I would love to see it as Bill Forsyth intended. I expect it would be even more powerful. Robin Williams is great. It really is a good film, but don't expect a laugh-a-minute or anything Hollywood. Because of the changes that the studio insisted upon it inhabits some kind of strange middle ground.

    Dear Movie Fans, I am a huge R. Williams fan so for me this was a treat... I watched this movie by accident while waiting for an extended repair on my car.. anyway it was great...His journey through time had my own imagination going wild...I sat traveling w/him thinking how I would react to these situations...I started to forget it was even Robin Williams in the film as odd as that sounds to some... I was completely sad when this movie ended...from that time on it has been a movie that comforts me when I'm down... please watch if you like both Williams & some soul searching. Psst also check out Mrs Doubtfire for a pick me up ;) Happy Viewing!

    I Love Robin Williams. The Guy is simply Amazing. So when I took my girlfriend to see this Movie in the theater I thought we would both be in for a treat. Instead... we watched a train wreck. Both of us kept looking at each other in disappointment as we started to fall asleep. About 50 Minutes into it we actually walked out. We had to. We Both wanted to! This thing just wasn't getting any better. I have never walked out of a movie in my entire life..... until this movie came on the screen. The Movie "Being Human" is truly Horrible. However I do recommend that you Rent it just so that you can see how horrible it is for yourself. I highly recommend it for people who have trouble falling asleep. When pills won't work.....
