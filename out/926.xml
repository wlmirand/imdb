    The high admiral of the fleet of the United States meets to decide if the captain "Dodge" (Kelsey Grammar), give it its own nuclear submarine. As not agree, decide to give one that comes from the Second World War, with the worst and wildest crew, and put on trial before a practice of war. Lighthearted film whose main attraction is being the playfulness of the whole script that, despite everything, is not as crazy as it may sound, unlike many other comedies of the absurd. Reminds me a bit to that great comedy "Operation Petticoat" Blake Edwards 1959. Actually, the story is left to tell and the picture is as good as any other submarine movie. View Kelsey Grammar (Dr. Frasier Winslow Crane), navy dress or playing golf in shirt is priceless, and meet with William H. Macy is an unexpected surprise from the chaotic distribution. Watching the two actors in roles that are so small is a really fun exercise, but it is definitely more fun to see how Rob Schneider repulsive disappears from the screen (literally and figuratively This film may instill values or thought-provoking or anything, however, you are assured a half hour of fun and laughter, which is often all you need. The cinema needs these absurd comedies and lighthearted as this "Down Periscope" or "Airplane!" 1980 or even more recent films like "Ali G Indahouse" 2002 "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" 1997 or "Step Brothers" 2008, are inconsequential films, but you do drop huge laughs.

    "Down Periscope" is actually quite good, sort of a naval take on the "Police Academy" if you will. Although labeled as a comedy, it is not the type of movie that will have you laughing out loud constantly, but the comedy in the movie is entertaining and well-used. The story is about Lt. Cmdr. Tom Dodge (played by Kelsey Grammar) who is given an old diesel-run submarine to participate in a wargame exercise against modern sea vessels. But as if an ancient submarine is not enough, he is also given a motley band of seamen. Actually the storyline was good and nicely executed, and there were actually moments of suspense in the movie, where you sit and root for the crew aboard the old submarine. The characters in the movie were colorful and fun, although most of them were somewhat unfit for naval duty, I think, but that just added to the comedy aspect. One of my favorite scenes is during a silent run, the cook rips a massive fart that smells horribly. I can't help but laugh so much during that scene, especially when you see the people's responses to the smell. Hilarious! "Down Periscope" actually brandish quite an astounding list of people on the cast list; Kelsey Grammar, Lauren Holly, Rob Schneider, Harry Dean Stanton, Bruce Dern, William H. Macy, Toby Huss, Rip Torn, Patton Oswalt, to mention the most familiar of faces. If you enjoy comedies like "Police Academy", then chances are that you will enjoy "Down Periscope" as well.

    'Down Periscope' is A Fair Comedy, that delivers some genuine laughs. 'Down Periscope' tells the story of a captain of a rust-bucket Navy submarine, the USS Stingray, who is fighting for his career as he is saddled with a group of misfit seamen. Watch 'Down Periscope' with limited expectations & I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Its a fair comedy, that doesn't fail to deliver. Hugh Wilson, Andrew Kurtzman & Eliot Wald's Screenplay is relaxing & funny. David S. Ward's Direction is perfect. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are fabulous. Performance-Wise: Kelsey Grammar is a terrific actor & he's in full from in here as well. Rob Schneider is extremely funny & likable. Lauren Holly is splendid. William H. Macy, as always, is perfect. Rip Torn & Bruce Dern are decent. Ken Hudson Campbell stands out. On the whole, 'Down Periscope' works.

    I really do not understand how this has an IMDb rating of 5.5. It was really relaxing and cheerful and had plenty of chuckles along. Each character got its own development and screen time. Kelsey Grammar's character is very likable and the characters are interesting enough for a movie of this type. Even the numerous jokes about his infamous tattoo are strangely funny, even though in another film they might put one off. A really fun movie that I would definitely recommend it for some laughs. Cheers.

    This Is A Film That Takes A Whack At All Submarine Movies, This Is Also The Only Submarine Movie I Will Watch With The Exception Of Das Boot(Don't Think That They Are Related Movies In Any Way, Shape Or Form). The Best Performance Is From Either Rob Schnider Or Kelsey Grammar, Both Were Absolutely Hysterical, Schnider Garuanteed Is A Good Performance In This Whether Your A Fan Of Him Or Not. The Tattoo On Kelsey Grammar's Penis In This Film Is By Far One Of The Best Ongoing Jokes In Cinematic History (In My Opinion) Its Funny At The End When Lauren Holly Asks "Whats This Tattoo Business I've Been Hearing About?" And He Replies "Well Its A LONG Story..." That Always Cracks Me Up. Overall I Highly Recommend This Film To A Fan Of Dumb Humour.

    I saw this movie at a small group night and really approached it with a cynical outlook. In my opinion most American comedies tend not to be all that funny (probably because I do not get their sense of humour). It takes a special comedy to appeal to me. I hate slapstick and the movie spoofs like Spy Hard have simply become so dull that they are no longer funny. Sometimes though there is an American film that actually has some life in it, and Down Periscope is one of them. This movie is a bumbling idiot comedy. Basically, like Police Academy, it is about a group of bumbling idiots who are given an impossible assignment and through some twist of fate they succeed. An irresponsible officer is given an opportunity to prove himself and is given an antiquated submarine and a crew of hopeless idiots and he is commanded to destroy two major naval ports, one in Charlston and the other at Norfolk. This is basically an impossible task for this is ancient submarine that still runs on diesel. I sort of like bumbling idiot movies, as long as they are done well. Down Periscope kept me interested and kept the laughs through to the end. It was not a hilarious movie at the beginning only to die at the end. It actually keeps the laughs going through. Yes, Down Periscope is worth it.

    My wife and I had some fun predicting when the clich&eacute;s where going to appear. We were almost never wrong. This movie has a pretty good cast and at first we figured it had to be an early 80's production. We were flabbergasted at discovering it is a mid 90's movie. Anyway, since both my wife and I were too tired to go for the remote control, we watched it on HBO and we could both feel our collective IQ being lowered as the minutes ticked. We finally decided to watch the whole thing mostly because we are both fans of K. Grammar and especially William H. Macy so we hoped that at some point there would be some sort of redeeming moment. No such luck. From a military standpoint, I believe they managed to ignore any military credibility the movie might have had. From the standpoint of ship at sea I sure hope our navy does not operate like that.

    Kelsey Grammar is Navy Lt. Cmdr. 'Tom' Dodge. He has been an officer for 20 years and time is running out for him to get his own ship. He expects to get a modern nuclear submarine. But two high level officers have a difference of opinion, and compromise. They will give Dodge an old, WW2 era diesel sub to command, with a makeshift crew of misfits, and let him be the aggressor in Virginia war games. If he succeeds in getting past the best defense the Navy has to offer, he will get a modern sub. With the deck strongly stacked against him, Dodge has to use his considerable ingenuity to accomplish the tasks. Cute Lauren Holly in her prime is Lt. Emily Lake, Diving Officer, who only has experience in simulators and and to learn to function in the real world of underwater. Rob Schneider is the ultra gung-ho Executive Officer Martin T. 'Marty' Pascal. Harry Dean Stanton is CPO Howard, Chief Engineer. Bruce Dern is RAdm. Yancy Graham who is against Dodge getting a command. William H. Macy is Cmdr. Carl Knox (Orlando) who is in the nuclear sub trying to thwart Dodge in the war game exercise. And Rip Torn is Vice Adm. Dean Winslow, who is on Dadge's side. The movie is not high art by any means, but Grammar is in good form, as are the other actors, and it is entertaining to see how the good guys work to come out on top.

    This is a really good submarine movie, in the tradition of +DestinationTokyo +Run Silent, Run Deep +Gray lady down Altho the crew is a bunch of "characters" -- just like many war movies -- they are not really a bunch of screw-ups. Kelsey Grammar plays it straight, and he seems to be the kind of skipper we would all like to have. For me, the movie delivered 110% -- I don't have much patience for nonsense anymore, but this one was GREAT!! Settle down and watch it like it deserves. Rick Jolley Tombstone, AZ

    I like Kelsey Grammar very much and I was looking forward to seeing this movie when it first came out in theaters, so I was shocked by how bad it was--boring and juvenile with really bad jokes. I nearly fell asleep during it. If it wasn't for the fact that I was with someone else, I would have left before it was over, which I've only been inclined to do during two other theater movies. Given Kelsey's long career of higher-brow humor I was surprised by the low-brow humor. One of my least favorite movies. Might be OK for a 12-year-old boy who is easily entertained. If you are interested in this sort of thing, I recommend the old McHale's Navy TV program instead.

    'Down Periscope' is A Fair Comedy, that delivers some genuine laughs. 'Down Periscope' tells the story of a captain of a rust-bucket Navy submarine, the USS Stingray, who is fighting for his career as he is saddled with a group of misfit seamen. Watch 'Down Periscope' with limited expectations & I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Its a fair comedy, that doesn't fail to deliver. Hugh Wilson, Andrew Kurtzman & Eliot Wald's Screenplay is relaxing & funny. David S. Ward's Direction is perfect. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are fabulous. Performance-Wise: Kelsey Grammar is a terrific actor & he's in full from in here as well. Rob Schneider is extremely funny & likable. Lauren Holly is splendid. William H. Macy, as always, is perfect. Rip Torn & Bruce Dern are decent. Ken Hudson Campbell stands out. On the whole, 'Down Periscope' works.

    I really do not understand how this has an IMDb rating of 5.5. It was really relaxing and cheerful and had plenty of chuckles along. Each character got its own development and screen time. Kelsey Grammar's character is very likable and the characters are interesting enough for a movie of this type. Even the numerous jokes about his infamous tattoo are strangely funny, even though in another film they might put one off. A really fun movie that I would definitely recommend it for some laughs. Cheers.

    This Is A Film That Takes A Whack At All Submarine Movies, This Is Also The Only Submarine Movie I Will Watch With The Exception Of Das Boot(Don't Think That They Are Related Movies In Any Way, Shape Or Form). The Best Performance Is From Either Rob Schnider Or Kelsey Grammar, Both Were Absolutely Hysterical, Schnider Garuanteed Is A Good Performance In This Whether Your A Fan Of Him Or Not. The Tattoo On Kelsey Grammar's Penis In This Film Is By Far One Of The Best Ongoing Jokes In Cinematic History (In My Opinion) Its Funny At The End When Lauren Holly Asks "Whats This Tattoo Business I've Been Hearing About?" And He Replies "Well Its A LONG Story..." That Always Cracks Me Up. Overall I Highly Recommend This Film To A Fan Of Dumb Humour.

    I saw this movie at a small group night and really approached it with a cynical outlook. In my opinion most American comedies tend not to be all that funny (probably because I do not get their sense of humour). It takes a special comedy to appeal to me. I hate slapstick and the movie spoofs like Spy Hard have simply become so dull that they are no longer funny. Sometimes though there is an American film that actually has some life in it, and Down Periscope is one of them. This movie is a bumbling idiot comedy. Basically, like Police Academy, it is about a group of bumbling idiots who are given an impossible assignment and through some twist of fate they succeed. An irresponsible officer is given an opportunity to prove himself and is given an antiquated submarine and a crew of hopeless idiots and he is commanded to destroy two major naval ports, one in Charlston and the other at Norfolk. This is basically an impossible task for this is ancient submarine that still runs on diesel. I sort of like bumbling idiot movies, as long as they are done well. Down Periscope kept me interested and kept the laughs through to the end. It was not a hilarious movie at the beginning only to die at the end. It actually keeps the laughs going through. Yes, Down Periscope is worth it.

    My wife and I had some fun predicting when the clich&eacute;s where going to appear. We were almost never wrong. This movie has a pretty good cast and at first we figured it had to be an early 80's production. We were flabbergasted at discovering it is a mid 90's movie. Anyway, since both my wife and I were too tired to go for the remote control, we watched it on HBO and we could both feel our collective IQ being lowered as the minutes ticked. We finally decided to watch the whole thing mostly because we are both fans of K. Grammar and especially William H. Macy so we hoped that at some point there would be some sort of redeeming moment. No such luck. From a military standpoint, I believe they managed to ignore any military credibility the movie might have had. From the standpoint of ship at sea I sure hope our navy does not operate like that.

    Kelsey Grammar is Navy Lt. Cmdr. 'Tom' Dodge. He has been an officer for 20 years and time is running out for him to get his own ship. He expects to get a modern nuclear submarine. But two high level officers have a difference of opinion, and compromise. They will give Dodge an old, WW2 era diesel sub to command, with a makeshift crew of misfits, and let him be the aggressor in Virginia war games. If he succeeds in getting past the best defense the Navy has to offer, he will get a modern sub. With the deck strongly stacked against him, Dodge has to use his considerable ingenuity to accomplish the tasks. Cute Lauren Holly in her prime is Lt. Emily Lake, Diving Officer, who only has experience in simulators and and to learn to function in the real world of underwater. Rob Schneider is the ultra gung-ho Executive Officer Martin T. 'Marty' Pascal. Harry Dean Stanton is CPO Howard, Chief Engineer. Bruce Dern is RAdm. Yancy Graham who is against Dodge getting a command. William H. Macy is Cmdr. Carl Knox (Orlando) who is in the nuclear sub trying to thwart Dodge in the war game exercise. And Rip Torn is Vice Adm. Dean Winslow, who is on Dadge's side. The movie is not high art by any means, but Grammar is in good form, as are the other actors, and it is entertaining to see how the good guys work to come out on top.

    This is a really good submarine movie, in the tradition of +DestinationTokyo +Run Silent, Run Deep +Gray lady down Altho the crew is a bunch of "characters" -- just like many war movies -- they are not really a bunch of screw-ups. Kelsey Grammar plays it straight, and he seems to be the kind of skipper we would all like to have. For me, the movie delivered 110% -- I don't have much patience for nonsense anymore, but this one was GREAT!! Settle down and watch it like it deserves. Rick Jolley Tombstone, AZ

    I like Kelsey Grammar very much and I was looking forward to seeing this movie when it first came out in theaters, so I was shocked by how bad it was--boring and juvenile with really bad jokes. I nearly fell asleep during it. If it wasn't for the fact that I was with someone else, I would have left before it was over, which I've only been inclined to do during two other theater movies. Given Kelsey's long career of higher-brow humor I was surprised by the low-brow humor. One of my least favorite movies. Might be OK for a 12-year-old boy who is easily entertained. If you are interested in this sort of thing, I recommend the old McHale's Navy TV program instead.

    The high admiral of the fleet of the United States meets to decide if the captain "Dodge" (Kelsey Grammar), give it its own nuclear submarine. As not agree, decide to give one that comes from the Second World War, with the worst and wildest crew, and put on trial before a practice of war. Lighthearted film whose main attraction is being the playfulness of the whole script that, despite everything, is not as crazy as it may sound, unlike many other comedies of the absurd. Reminds me a bit to that great comedy "Operation Petticoat" Blake Edwards 1959. Actually, the story is left to tell and the picture is as good as any other submarine movie. View Kelsey Grammar (Dr. Frasier Winslow Crane), navy dress or playing golf in shirt is priceless, and meet with William H. Macy is an unexpected surprise from the chaotic distribution. Watching the two actors in roles that are so small is a really fun exercise, but it is definitely more fun to see how Rob Schneider repulsive disappears from the screen (literally and figuratively This film may instill values or thought-provoking or anything, however, you are assured a half hour of fun and laughter, which is often all you need. The cinema needs these absurd comedies and lighthearted as this "Down Periscope" or "Airplane!" 1980 or even more recent films like "Ali G Indahouse" 2002 "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" 1997 or "Step Brothers" 2008, are inconsequential films, but you do drop huge laughs.

    "Down Periscope" is actually quite good, sort of a naval take on the "Police Academy" if you will. Although labeled as a comedy, it is not the type of movie that will have you laughing out loud constantly, but the comedy in the movie is entertaining and well-used. The story is about Lt. Cmdr. Tom Dodge (played by Kelsey Grammar) who is given an old diesel-run submarine to participate in a wargame exercise against modern sea vessels. But as if an ancient submarine is not enough, he is also given a motley band of seamen. Actually the storyline was good and nicely executed, and there were actually moments of suspense in the movie, where you sit and root for the crew aboard the old submarine. The characters in the movie were colorful and fun, although most of them were somewhat unfit for naval duty, I think, but that just added to the comedy aspect. One of my favorite scenes is during a silent run, the cook rips a massive fart that smells horribly. I can't help but laugh so much during that scene, especially when you see the people's responses to the smell. Hilarious! "Down Periscope" actually brandish quite an astounding list of people on the cast list; Kelsey Grammar, Lauren Holly, Rob Schneider, Harry Dean Stanton, Bruce Dern, William H. Macy, Toby Huss, Rip Torn, Patton Oswalt, to mention the most familiar of faces. If you enjoy comedies like "Police Academy", then chances are that you will enjoy "Down Periscope" as well.

    Kelsey Grammar is Navy Lt. Cmdr. 'Tom' Dodge. He has been an officer for 20 years and time is running out for him to get his own ship. He expects to get a modern nuclear submarine. But two high level officers have a difference of opinion, and compromise. They will give Dodge an old, WW2 era diesel sub to command, with a makeshift crew of misfits, and let him be the aggressor in Virginia war games. If he succeeds in getting past the best defense the Navy has to offer, he will get a modern sub. With the deck strongly stacked against him, Dodge has to use his considerable ingenuity to accomplish the tasks. Cute Lauren Holly in her prime is Lt. Emily Lake, Diving Officer, who only has experience in simulators and and to learn to function in the real world of underwater. Rob Schneider is the ultra gung-ho Executive Officer Martin T. 'Marty' Pascal. Harry Dean Stanton is CPO Howard, Chief Engineer. Bruce Dern is RAdm. Yancy Graham who is against Dodge getting a command. William H. Macy is Cmdr. Carl Knox (Orlando) who is in the nuclear sub trying to thwart Dodge in the war game exercise. And Rip Torn is Vice Adm. Dean Winslow, who is on Dadge's side. The movie is not high art by any means, but Grammar is in good form, as are the other actors, and it is entertaining to see how the good guys work to come out on top.

    This is a really good submarine movie, in the tradition of +DestinationTokyo +Run Silent, Run Deep +Gray lady down Altho the crew is a bunch of "characters" -- just like many war movies -- they are not really a bunch of screw-ups. Kelsey Grammar plays it straight, and he seems to be the kind of skipper we would all like to have. For me, the movie delivered 110% -- I don't have much patience for nonsense anymore, but this one was GREAT!! Settle down and watch it like it deserves. Rick Jolley Tombstone, AZ

    I like Kelsey Grammar very much and I was looking forward to seeing this movie when it first came out in theaters, so I was shocked by how bad it was--boring and juvenile with really bad jokes. I nearly fell asleep during it. If it wasn't for the fact that I was with someone else, I would have left before it was over, which I've only been inclined to do during two other theater movies. Given Kelsey's long career of higher-brow humor I was surprised by the low-brow humor. One of my least favorite movies. Might be OK for a 12-year-old boy who is easily entertained. If you are interested in this sort of thing, I recommend the old McHale's Navy TV program instead.

    The high admiral of the fleet of the United States meets to decide if the captain "Dodge" (Kelsey Grammar), give it its own nuclear submarine. As not agree, decide to give one that comes from the Second World War, with the worst and wildest crew, and put on trial before a practice of war. Lighthearted film whose main attraction is being the playfulness of the whole script that, despite everything, is not as crazy as it may sound, unlike many other comedies of the absurd. Reminds me a bit to that great comedy "Operation Petticoat" Blake Edwards 1959. Actually, the story is left to tell and the picture is as good as any other submarine movie. View Kelsey Grammar (Dr. Frasier Winslow Crane), navy dress or playing golf in shirt is priceless, and meet with William H. Macy is an unexpected surprise from the chaotic distribution. Watching the two actors in roles that are so small is a really fun exercise, but it is definitely more fun to see how Rob Schneider repulsive disappears from the screen (literally and figuratively This film may instill values or thought-provoking or anything, however, you are assured a half hour of fun and laughter, which is often all you need. The cinema needs these absurd comedies and lighthearted as this "Down Periscope" or "Airplane!" 1980 or even more recent films like "Ali G Indahouse" 2002 "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" 1997 or "Step Brothers" 2008, are inconsequential films, but you do drop huge laughs.

    "Down Periscope" is actually quite good, sort of a naval take on the "Police Academy" if you will. Although labeled as a comedy, it is not the type of movie that will have you laughing out loud constantly, but the comedy in the movie is entertaining and well-used. The story is about Lt. Cmdr. Tom Dodge (played by Kelsey Grammar) who is given an old diesel-run submarine to participate in a wargame exercise against modern sea vessels. But as if an ancient submarine is not enough, he is also given a motley band of seamen. Actually the storyline was good and nicely executed, and there were actually moments of suspense in the movie, where you sit and root for the crew aboard the old submarine. The characters in the movie were colorful and fun, although most of them were somewhat unfit for naval duty, I think, but that just added to the comedy aspect. One of my favorite scenes is during a silent run, the cook rips a massive fart that smells horribly. I can't help but laugh so much during that scene, especially when you see the people's responses to the smell. Hilarious! "Down Periscope" actually brandish quite an astounding list of people on the cast list; Kelsey Grammar, Lauren Holly, Rob Schneider, Harry Dean Stanton, Bruce Dern, William H. Macy, Toby Huss, Rip Torn, Patton Oswalt, to mention the most familiar of faces. If you enjoy comedies like "Police Academy", then chances are that you will enjoy "Down Periscope" as well.

    'Down Periscope' is A Fair Comedy, that delivers some genuine laughs. 'Down Periscope' tells the story of a captain of a rust-bucket Navy submarine, the USS Stingray, who is fighting for his career as he is saddled with a group of misfit seamen. Watch 'Down Periscope' with limited expectations & I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Its a fair comedy, that doesn't fail to deliver. Hugh Wilson, Andrew Kurtzman & Eliot Wald's Screenplay is relaxing & funny. David S. Ward's Direction is perfect. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are fabulous. Performance-Wise: Kelsey Grammar is a terrific actor & he's in full from in here as well. Rob Schneider is extremely funny & likable. Lauren Holly is splendid. William H. Macy, as always, is perfect. Rip Torn & Bruce Dern are decent. Ken Hudson Campbell stands out. On the whole, 'Down Periscope' works.

    I really do not understand how this has an IMDb rating of 5.5. It was really relaxing and cheerful and had plenty of chuckles along. Each character got its own development and screen time. Kelsey Grammar's character is very likable and the characters are interesting enough for a movie of this type. Even the numerous jokes about his infamous tattoo are strangely funny, even though in another film they might put one off. A really fun movie that I would definitely recommend it for some laughs. Cheers.

    This Is A Film That Takes A Whack At All Submarine Movies, This Is Also The Only Submarine Movie I Will Watch With The Exception Of Das Boot(Don't Think That They Are Related Movies In Any Way, Shape Or Form). The Best Performance Is From Either Rob Schnider Or Kelsey Grammar, Both Were Absolutely Hysterical, Schnider Garuanteed Is A Good Performance In This Whether Your A Fan Of Him Or Not. The Tattoo On Kelsey Grammar's Penis In This Film Is By Far One Of The Best Ongoing Jokes In Cinematic History (In My Opinion) Its Funny At The End When Lauren Holly Asks "Whats This Tattoo Business I've Been Hearing About?" And He Replies "Well Its A LONG Story..." That Always Cracks Me Up. Overall I Highly Recommend This Film To A Fan Of Dumb Humour.

    I saw this movie at a small group night and really approached it with a cynical outlook. In my opinion most American comedies tend not to be all that funny (probably because I do not get their sense of humour). It takes a special comedy to appeal to me. I hate slapstick and the movie spoofs like Spy Hard have simply become so dull that they are no longer funny. Sometimes though there is an American film that actually has some life in it, and Down Periscope is one of them. This movie is a bumbling idiot comedy. Basically, like Police Academy, it is about a group of bumbling idiots who are given an impossible assignment and through some twist of fate they succeed. An irresponsible officer is given an opportunity to prove himself and is given an antiquated submarine and a crew of hopeless idiots and he is commanded to destroy two major naval ports, one in Charlston and the other at Norfolk. This is basically an impossible task for this is ancient submarine that still runs on diesel. I sort of like bumbling idiot movies, as long as they are done well. Down Periscope kept me interested and kept the laughs through to the end. It was not a hilarious movie at the beginning only to die at the end. It actually keeps the laughs going through. Yes, Down Periscope is worth it.

    My wife and I had some fun predicting when the clich&eacute;s where going to appear. We were almost never wrong. This movie has a pretty good cast and at first we figured it had to be an early 80's production. We were flabbergasted at discovering it is a mid 90's movie. Anyway, since both my wife and I were too tired to go for the remote control, we watched it on HBO and we could both feel our collective IQ being lowered as the minutes ticked. We finally decided to watch the whole thing mostly because we are both fans of K. Grammar and especially William H. Macy so we hoped that at some point there would be some sort of redeeming moment. No such luck. From a military standpoint, I believe they managed to ignore any military credibility the movie might have had. From the standpoint of ship at sea I sure hope our navy does not operate like that.
