 <sinopse>
  A mentally ill young woman finds her love in an eccentric man who models himself after Buster Keaton.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In a small town, an auto mechanic named Benny is devoted to taking care of his mentally ill sister, Joon, who can barely function alone in the real world despite being a talented artist. This relatively stable situation is shaken up when Benny is obliged in a poker game to welcome another player's relative, Sam, to his home for a few days. When Sam arrives, he quickly makes an impression with his quietly eccentric ways which emulate the antics of the great silent movie comedian, Buster Keaton. Without Benny's full knowledge, Sam and Joon find themselves drawn to each other to the fullest degree. However when Benny finds out, it creates a rift in the siblings as they struggle to accept their relationship is profoundly changing with the presence of this odd newcomer.

    It's a shame that this film is not very popular. At least I only know very few people who have watched this wonderful movie. But it is really worth watching, as the story is beautiful and heartwarming; the music is lovely; Mary Stuart Masterson's, Johnny Depp's and Aidan Quinn's acting is brilliant; there are scenes that are unforgettable; sad, funny, extraordinary and touching moments; and this film makes you love mentally ill people. It shows that they are 'normal', sometimes they just do things in a different way than we do (e.g. making toast or cleaning the house) and that they can have amazing talents that you would never expect. Benny&Joon is definitely one of my favourites and I recommend it to everybody who does not necessarily need a lot of action etc. in a movie.

    At the heart of 'Benny & Joon' is the story of Joon, a mentally ill young woman, and her older brother Benny, who takes constant care of her and, while complaining about how much that complicates his life, actually uses the obligation as an excuse for the fact that his own life is going nowhere. It's a story that's simple, realistic and painfully honest. It could have made for a touching little drama if only Chechik made a clean decision that that's what the film is about. Unfortunately, 'Benny & Joon's biggest asset is also its undoing, and that is the wonderful and charismatic performance of young Johnny Depp. Depp enters the scene almost halfway through as Joon's love interest, the mentally unbalanced but extremely charming Sam who chooses to model his personality (or lack thereof) on silent comedy stars Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Sam swoops Joon off her feet and disrupts the delicate balance of the siblings' relationship, which forces Benny to face up and decide whether he can let Joon go or not. Depp is terrific in his role; in one extended scene where he showcases his slapstick abilities he proves just how much of a screen personality he was and why he became one of the most bankable movie stars of the 90's. The problem is that he's so charismatic that he can easily fool the audience (and often does) that Sam is a romantic hero rather than a disruptive, chaotic presence; that this is the love story of Joon and Sam, rather than the story of Benny and his coming to terms with his own life decisions. What's worse, Depp's charisma emphasizes just how pale and unimpressive Aidan Quinn is in the role that should have been the lead. It's not a bad film; it's a pretty and touching little drama, wonderfully scripted. On the other hand, Depp's scenes are a pleasure to behold. But the contrast between the two is what ultimately makes it a failure. It doesn't help that Chechik can't quite make up his mind about how seriously he's taking Joon's mental illness, which is played for laughs a bit too often.

    I should have wrote this review about a month ago when i first saw the movie however i kept just putting it off for no reason. So Johnny Depp is the " man " I'm serious and this film shows his acting skills through dialogue , feelings , emotions and movements. I know its not like his other more popular movies like Pirates of the Caribbean , Edward Scissorhands and others but this one has a special place. This movie is all about loving each other and taking care of another person like Benny was trying to do for joon - I was trying to figure were his mind was at for majority of the film and I'm glad of the outcome because you could tell what his feelings toward Sam were overtime of the film. Joon was very interesting herself - mentally ill yet so artistic seems only right her and a guy like BuStEr kEaToN ( Sam ) would have a connection. I also really liked the scene of them trusting each other and feeling comfortable enough to make real love with one another . In my opinion it was great not seeing private parts it was not needed for the movie , If they would have shown skin it would have seemed to romantic or to open or to pushy or trying to hard for that scene. Its so obvious that Depp did a great job as this quirky / silly / warm hearted / caring / unique character. Benny & Joon's actors also give a good performance I'm not sure how well Aiden and MsM ( Mary s masterson ) would / have done in other movies but in this one they do well and even better when in scenes with Depp. Also I loved the song " 500 miles" they used in the beginning and ending which matched perfectly and had the song in my head all night ! This movie has an amazing three characters and actors -1= some what plays the straight man Benny who changes - 2 = mentally ill yet creative Joon and 3 = wonderful and different one of a kind Sam a guy like buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin ,soundtrack great and overall a happy movie with tons of laughs till the last scene. My family ( even my mom who dislikes a lot of movies loved this one) - especially the ending of this quirky / cute / comedy movie. I recommend this movie go watch it !!

    Searching round online for a friend recently, who was after any info related to a Bollywood movie called Barfi!,I was surprised to discover,that the new Bollywood title seemed to have been greatly inspired by a near forgotten 1993 Rom-Com Drama starring Johnny Depp.With being very interested in discovering where the Bollywood movie took its inspiration from,I decided that it was a good time to pay Benny and Joon a hopefully special visit. The plot: Finding it increasingly difficult to look after his mentally ill sister Juniper "Joon" Pearl,Benjamin "Benny" Pearl decides to pay a visit to the family's doctor (Dr.Garvey),in the hope that she can find a solution so that Benny can continue to look after Joon and keep a grip on his job as a mechanic. With having always been impressed with how Benny has coped with the pressure of looking after his sister,ever since their parents tragically died in a car crash 12 years ago,Dr.Garvey advises Benjamin that it might be a good idea if he allowed for some "space" to be created between himself and Jupier,by allowing Joon to go into a group home.Feeling uneasy about Garvey's suggestion,Benjamin promises her that he will think about the idea,quickly leaves Garvey's office,and heads home to Joon. Giving up on finding someone who can take care of his sister so that he attend a weekly poker night with his work mates,Benny decides that for the first time ever,he will take Joon along to the poker night. Pleased to see all his workmates and Joon getting on with each other,Benny decides to leave the table so that he can sort out some food.Returning to the table,Benjamin is shocked to find out that Juniper is playing an intense game of poker with a work buddy of his called Mike. Demanding that the game is stopped,Benny discovers that he is to late,when Joon reveals her game-losing hand.Prepairing to pay up Joon's debt,Benny is left speechless when Mike tells him that the bet does not involve money,but instead involves Benny having to take care of Mike's mentally ill cousin called Sam. View on the film: Showing signs of what could have been if he had not had a terrible double knock-out in his film career with Diabolique and the infamous 1998 box office bomb The Avengers, (which,in the guys defence,was re-cut against his wishes by the studio)director Jeremiah S.Chechik uses long,elegant zoom takes which allow the natural chemistry that the actors/character have with each other to be placed right at the front of the movie,with the long tacks also allowing for subtle changes in the body language from each of the characters to rise to the suffice. Along with the classy,long zoom takes and filling the soundtrack with some prime Grunge cuts, (with one of the highlights being a song used from the great band Temple of the Dog)Chechik and cinematography John Schwartzman keep any dark colours firmly isolated to the movies one flashback scenes,so that they can scatter the film with light colours,that along with connecting to Joon's interest in art,also gives the film an irresistible breezy atmosphere. Keeping away from the traditional route of Rom-Com Drama's where a boo- hiss baddie does everything to tear the characters apart,the excellent screenplay by Barry Berman and Lesley McNeil instead shows each of the characters to be flawed,but good hearted people,with the terrific group of supporting actors (William H.Macy,Oliver Platt and Joe Grifasi) emphasising the tight-knitted community that Berman and McNeil build in the screenplay. Taking things in a pretty original direction by making Benny and Joon brother and sister instead of lovers,Berman and McNeil show the family bond to run strong between each of them,with Joon trying to sort out a date for Benny,and Benny doing his best to handle the problems relate to Joon's mental difficulty due to how much he cares about his sister,which also strongly makes the important,non-preachy central message of the film that people with mental problems or learning difficulties should be treated with the same amount of respect that others receives. Shuffling into the film with the spirit of Buster Keaton in his wings,Johnny Depp gives a splendid performance as Sam,with Depp performing a number of eye-catching,Keaton inspired stunts himself.Along with the impressive stunt work,Depp also does very well at showing Sam slowly break out of his timed shell,as he finds himself,initially unknowingly building a strong connection between Benny and Joon,with Joon's mental problems allowing Sam to feel that he has met someone who he can deeply relate to. Placed at the heart of the movie,Mary Stuart Masterson and Aidan Quinn each give great performances that compliment Benny and Joon's strahants and weaknesses,with Quinn giving a big warm hearted performance as Benny,who he shows is starting to feel distraught over being unable to find a away to deal with Joons difficulties,and Masterson showing Joon trying to deal with her mental problems,with the help of her loyal brother Benny and "new" family member Sam.

    "Benny & Joon" remains distinctive 20 years later for its handling of mental illness, choosing boldly not to preoccupy itself with a clinical approach and instead to focus on its impact on relationships. But really, it's Johnny Depp who makes it a memorable film. The least interesting of the three main characters is the protagonist in this film, Aidan Quinn's Benny. Benny is the blue collar older brother of the mentally unstable Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), an artist prone to fits including throwing things and pyromania. Both are adults, but Joon obviously needs to be cared for as if a child. After her most recent caretaker quites, Benny finds himself forced to think about sending Joon to a living community, but plans are stalled when an unusual young man ends up in their lives. Sam (Depp) is an eccentric, a young man who models his behavior off silent film star Buster Keaton and performs various physical comedy gags both on purpose yet also intuitively. He charms Joon and after awhile even manages to impress Benny, but he slowly starts to complicate the dynamic between brother and sister. Depp's performance exhibits Keaton but also Gene Wilder ala "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." He's a joy to watch and an absolute natural when it comes to quirkiness. Although audiences had a taste of his talent in "Edward Scissorhands," it's this film where he shows just how excellent of a physical actor he is, foretelling of his eventual mainstream success. Interesting that Depp gets top billing in the credits when it's a film mostly centered on how Benny will deal with Joon. Perhaps "Christmas Vacation" director Jeremiah S. Chechik didn't realize until into filming how great of a performance he was going to get. Regardless, the script from Berry Berman and Lesley McNeil certainly didn't account for it. We spend too much time watching Benny mishandle Joon as well as his personal life despite his good heart and best intentions. A side plot he has with Julianne Moore as the waitress Ruthie completely detracts from the characters that should be getting more screen time, and it's frustrating because their conflict is handled with such immaturity on the part of both characters. With Joon's disorder not diagnosed for the audience, Masterson has little to draw upon for her performance, but she endears us to Joon with a wide-eyed approach whenever she's not throwing a tantrum. Her preoccupation with a man who also has his quirks but wears them so proudly makes a lot of sense, but we don't get to see their relationship blossom with so much of the film spent following Benny around. It's unclear whether writer Berman intended to have the other characters who aren't Joon make poor decisions about their lives in order to make a point. On one hand, such a notion would be wise and true to a certain degree, but on the other, the decisions are so rash that one has to question the authenticity of the characters. "Benny & Joon" mostly sees all its conflict underdeveloped, but the story generates enough curiosity to last the length of the film (though it could really be shorter). Depp's convincing and unusual turn brings a certain life, energy and most importantly memorability to the film, a comedy angle that the film sorely needs. Its approach to conflict is not serious enough to consider it a drama, but it's not nearly romantic enough to be considered a romance. Understandably, it's remembered as a comedy. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more

    I wasn't expecting too much from this but it turned out to be a lot more heart warming and touching of a movie then I would've thought. The story is about a girl with a mental illness, her protective brother and a slightly child like man-child who is talented in a Buster Keaton kind of way. This is a role unlike anything else you've seen Johnny Depp in. Mary Stuart Masterson has a very well layered role and Aidan Quinn plays her protective older brother. Julianne Moore in one of her first roles plays a waitress at the local diner who's a failed actress who's come home from an attempt in Los Angeles that didn't go as well as she had hoped.

    Benny & Joon is a romantic comedy film about how two eccentric individuals, Sam and Juniper,also known as "Joon",who find each other and fall in love.It stars Johnny Depp,Mary Stuart Masterson,Aidan Quinn together with William H. Macy,Julianne Moore and Oliver Platt.It was written by Barry Berman and Lesley McNeil; and it was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. Benny runs a small car repair shop. He must also take care of his mentally ill sister Juniper, better known as Joon. After losing a bet, Benny is forced to bring another eccentric into his house.His name is Sam, the cousin of a friend. Not inclined to conversation, Sam expresses himself by performing Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines.Not surprisingly, he immediately hits it off with Joon. As Sam and Joon fall deeper in love, Benny for the first time in life experiences the pangs of jealousy. Good acting,funny plot and great characters.Although there are some problems in the script and directing,the performances of the cast overshadowed them particularly Johnny Depp,who did extremely well as a physical comedian.His portrayal of Sam is delicately touching, a maladjusted waif with both soul and grit.Watch this for his performance alone.Added to that,Mary Stuart Masterson resists the temptation to soften Joon. That in itself made this movie compelling and worth watching.

    The part for Johnny Depp was tailor-made. As a Buster Keaton look-alike and showing amazing talents, Depp would go on to a career with strong performances as way-out characters. This film is no exception. A very challenged mentally ill woman finds love with the Depp character. Her protective brother can't see it until he realizes that he also has a life to live-in this case with Julianne Moore. The film proves that mentally challenged people can find happiness under certain circumstances. If possible, they must be given the freedom to pursue this. Moore is excellent in the role as the mentally challenged woman. Her total breakdown on the bus was a scene of rare quality. As the brother, Aidan Quinn is totally sympathetic in the part. There are certainly comical breaks in this challenging film.

    I would say this film was pretty much a clich&eacute;. Two strange people fall in love in this mainstream society. But there were some interesting aspects: for example, there was not too many mushy-mushy moments of verbally expressing love (I really can't stand that in films!); also, the actors were believable and did not over do it. But overall, the film didn't give any insight on new ideas and just focused on a standard topic of "forbidden love", and was pretty much predictable all the way till the end just like all Hollywood films. As a Johnny Depp fan, I don't regret watching it, but it is not a movie I would recommend to anyone.

    Today "Benny and Joon", a 1993 romantic comedy, is mostly remembered for an oddball performance by actor Johnny Depp, who plays a young man with a fondness for impersonating silent Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines. Depp can't touch Chaplin or Keaton, but his character is at times heartwarming. Depp fangals adore the film, particularly the way Depp risks life and limb for his woman, sticking by her side no matter what. The ladies love it. The film features an early performance by the always interesting Julianne Moore. Like Depp's character, hers is a meta-roll, Moore a good actress playing a bad actress who gave up bad acting to be a good waiter. Most of the film is filler, but Moore and Depp elevate things. Depp would make a career out of playing oddball characters. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    It's a shame that this film is not very popular. At least I only know very few people who have watched this wonderful movie. But it is really worth watching, as the story is beautiful and heartwarming; the music is lovely; Mary Stuart Masterson's, Johnny Depp's and Aidan Quinn's acting is brilliant; there are scenes that are unforgettable; sad, funny, extraordinary and touching moments; and this film makes you love mentally ill people. It shows that they are 'normal', sometimes they just do things in a different way than we do (e.g. making toast or cleaning the house) and that they can have amazing talents that you would never expect. Benny&Joon is definitely one of my favourites and I recommend it to everybody who does not necessarily need a lot of action etc. in a movie.

    I should have wrote this review about a month ago when i first saw the movie however i kept just putting it off for no reason. So Johnny Depp is the " man " I'm serious and this film shows his acting skills through dialogue , feelings , emotions and movements. I know its not like his other more popular movies like Pirates of the Caribbean , Edward Scissorhands and others but this one has a special place. This movie is all about loving each other and taking care of another person like Benny was trying to do for joon - I was trying to figure were his mind was at for majority of the film and I'm glad of the outcome because you could tell what his feelings toward Sam were overtime of the film. Joon was very interesting herself - mentally ill yet so artistic seems only right her and a guy like BuStEr kEaToN ( Sam ) would have a connection. I also really liked the scene of them trusting each other and feeling comfortable enough to make real love with one another . In my opinion it was great not seeing private parts it was not needed for the movie , If they would have shown skin it would have seemed to romantic or to open or to pushy or trying to hard for that scene. Its so obvious that Depp did a great job as this quirky / silly / warm hearted / caring / unique character. Benny & Joon's actors also give a good performance I'm not sure how well Aiden and MsM ( Mary s masterson ) would / have done in other movies but in this one they do well and even better when in scenes with Depp. Also I loved the song " 500 miles" they used in the beginning and ending which matched perfectly and had the song in my head all night ! This movie has an amazing three characters and actors -1= some what plays the straight man Benny who changes - 2 = mentally ill yet creative Joon and 3 = wonderful and different one of a kind Sam a guy like buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin ,soundtrack great and overall a happy movie with tons of laughs till the last scene. My family ( even my mom who dislikes a lot of movies loved this one) - especially the ending of this quirky / cute / comedy movie. I recommend this movie go watch it !!

Placed at the heart of the movie,Mary Stuart Masterson and Aidan Quinn each give great performances that compliment Benny and Joon's strahants and weaknesses,with Quinn giving a big warm hearted performance as Benny,who he shows is starting to feel distraught over being unable to find a away to deal with Joons difficulties,and Masterson showing Joon trying to deal with her mental problems,with the help of her loyal brother Benny and "new" family member Sam.

    "Benny & Joon" remains distinctive 20 years later for its handling of mental illness, choosing boldly not to preoccupy itself with a clinical approach and instead to focus on its impact on relationships. But really, it's Johnny Depp who makes it a memorable film. The least interesting of the three main characters is the protagonist in this film, Aidan Quinn's Benny. Benny is the blue collar older brother of the mentally unstable Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), an artist prone to fits including throwing things and pyromania. Both are adults, but Joon obviously needs to be cared for as if a child. After her most recent caretaker quites, Benny finds himself forced to think about sending Joon to a living community, but plans are stalled when an unusual young man ends up in their lives. Sam (Depp) is an eccentric, a young man who models his behavior off silent film star Buster Keaton and performs various physical comedy gags both on purpose yet also intuitively. He charms Joon and after awhile even manages to impress Benny, but he slowly starts to complicate the dynamic between brother and sister. Depp's performance exhibits Keaton but also Gene Wilder ala "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." He's a joy to watch and an absolute natural when it comes to quirkiness. Although audiences had a taste of his talent in "Edward Scissorhands," it's this film where he shows just how excellent of a physical actor he is, foretelling of his eventual mainstream success. Interesting that Depp gets top billing in the credits when it's a film mostly centered on how Benny will deal with Joon. Perhaps "Christmas Vacation" director Jeremiah S. Chechik didn't realize until into filming how great of a performance he was going to get. Regardless, the script from Berry Berman and Lesley McNeil certainly didn't account for it. We spend too much time watching Benny mishandle Joon as well as his personal life despite his good heart and best intentions. A side plot he has with Julianne Moore as the waitress Ruthie completely detracts from the characters that should be getting more screen time, and it's frustrating because their conflict is handled with such immaturity on the part of both characters. With Joon's disorder not diagnosed for the audience, Masterson has little to draw upon for her performance, but she endears us to Joon with a wide-eyed approach whenever she's not throwing a tantrum. Her preoccupation with a man who also has his quirks but wears them so proudly makes a lot of sense, but we don't get to see their relationship blossom with so much of the film spent following Benny around. It's unclear whether writer Berman intended to have the other characters who aren't Joon make poor decisions about their lives in order to make a point. On one hand, such a notion would be wise and true to a certain degree, but on the other, the decisions are so rash that one has to question the authenticity of the characters. "Benny & Joon" mostly sees all its conflict underdeveloped, but the story generates enough curiosity to last the length of the film (though it could really be shorter). Depp's convincing and unusual turn brings a certain life, energy and most importantly memorability to the film, a comedy angle that the film sorely needs. Its approach to conflict is not serious enough to consider it a drama, but it's not nearly romantic enough to be considered a romance. Understandably, it's remembered as a comedy. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more

    I wasn't expecting too much from this but it turned out to be a lot more heart warming and touching of a movie then I would've thought. The story is about a girl with a mental illness, her protective brother and a slightly child like man-child who is talented in a Buster Keaton kind of way. This is a role unlike anything else you've seen Johnny Depp in. Mary Stuart Masterson has a very well layered role and Aidan Quinn plays her protective older brother. Julianne Moore in one of her first roles plays a waitress at the local diner who's a failed actress who's come home from an attempt in Los Angeles that didn't go as well as she had hoped.

    Benny & Joon is a romantic comedy film about how two eccentric individuals, Sam and Juniper,also known as "Joon",who find each other and fall in love.It stars Johnny Depp,Mary Stuart Masterson,Aidan Quinn together with William H. Macy,Julianne Moore and Oliver Platt.It was written by Barry Berman and Lesley McNeil; and it was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. Benny runs a small car repair shop. He must also take care of his mentally ill sister Juniper, better known as Joon. After losing a bet, Benny is forced to bring another eccentric into his house.His name is Sam, the cousin of a friend. Not inclined to conversation, Sam expresses himself by performing Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines.Not surprisingly, he immediately hits it off with Joon. As Sam and Joon fall deeper in love, Benny for the first time in life experiences the pangs of jealousy. Good acting,funny plot and great characters.Although there are some problems in the script and directing,the performances of the cast overshadowed them particularly Johnny Depp,who did extremely well as a physical comedian.His portrayal of Sam is delicately touching, a maladjusted waif with both soul and grit.Watch this for his performance alone.Added to that,Mary Stuart Masterson resists the temptation to soften Joon. That in itself made this movie compelling and worth watching.

    The part for Johnny Depp was tailor-made. As a Buster Keaton look-alike and showing amazing talents, Depp would go on to a career with strong performances as way-out characters. This film is no exception. A very challenged mentally ill woman finds love with the Depp character. Her protective brother can't see it until he realizes that he also has a life to live-in this case with Julianne Moore. The film proves that mentally challenged people can find happiness under certain circumstances. If possible, they must be given the freedom to pursue this. Moore is excellent in the role as the mentally challenged woman. Her total breakdown on the bus was a scene of rare quality. As the brother, Aidan Quinn is totally sympathetic in the part. There are certainly comical breaks in this challenging film.

    I would say this film was pretty much a clich&eacute;. Two strange people fall in love in this mainstream society. But there were some interesting aspects: for example, there was not too many mushy-mushy moments of verbally expressing love (I really can't stand that in films!); also, the actors were believable and did not over do it. But overall, the film didn't give any insight on new ideas and just focused on a standard topic of "forbidden love", and was pretty much predictable all the way till the end just like all Hollywood films. As a Johnny Depp fan, I don't regret watching it, but it is not a movie I would recommend to anyone.

    Today "Benny and Joon", a 1993 romantic comedy, is mostly remembered for an oddball performance by actor Johnny Depp, who plays a young man with a fondness for impersonating silent Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines. Depp can't touch Chaplin or Keaton, but his character is at times heartwarming. Depp fangals adore the film, particularly the way Depp risks life and limb for his woman, sticking by her side no matter what. The ladies love it. The film features an early performance by the always interesting Julianne Moore. Like Depp's character, hers is a meta-roll, Moore a good actress playing a bad actress who gave up bad acting to be a good waiter. Most of the film is filler, but Moore and Depp elevate things. Depp would make a career out of playing oddball characters. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    It's a shame that this film is not very popular. At least I only know very few people who have watched this wonderful movie. But it is really worth watching, as the story is beautiful and heartwarming; the music is lovely; Mary Stuart Masterson's, Johnny Depp's and Aidan Quinn's acting is brilliant; there are scenes that are unforgettable; sad, funny, extraordinary and touching moments; and this film makes you love mentally ill people. It shows that they are 'normal', sometimes they just do things in a different way than we do (e.g. making toast or cleaning the house) and that they can have amazing talents that you would never expect. Benny&Joon is definitely one of my favourites and I recommend it to everybody who does not necessarily need a lot of action etc. in a movie.

    At the heart of 'Benny & Joon' is the story of Joon, a mentally ill young woman, and her older brother Benny, who takes constant care of her and, while complaining about how much that complicates his life, actually uses the obligation as an excuse for the fact that his own life is going nowhere. It's a story that's simple, realistic and painfully honest. It could have made for a touching little drama if only Chechik made a clean decision that that's what the film is about. Unfortunately, 'Benny & Joon's biggest asset is also its undoing, and that is the wonderful and charismatic performance of young Johnny Depp. Depp enters the scene almost halfway through as Joon's love interest, the mentally unbalanced but extremely charming Sam who chooses to model his personality (or lack thereof) on silent comedy stars Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Sam swoops Joon off her feet and disrupts the delicate balance of the siblings' relationship, which forces Benny to face up and decide whether he can let Joon go or not. Depp is terrific in his role; in one extended scene where he showcases his slapstick abilities he proves just how much of a screen personality he was and why he became one of the most bankable movie stars of the 90's. The problem is that he's so charismatic that he can easily fool the audience (and often does) that Sam is a romantic hero rather than a disruptive, chaotic presence; that this is the love story of Joon and Sam, rather than the story of Benny and his coming to terms with his own life decisions. What's worse, Depp's charisma emphasizes just how pale and unimpressive Aidan Quinn is in the role that should have been the lead. It's not a bad film; it's a pretty and touching little drama, wonderfully scripted. On the other hand, Depp's scenes are a pleasure to behold. But the contrast between the two is what ultimately makes it a failure. It doesn't help that Chechik can't quite make up his mind about how seriously he's taking Joon's mental illness, which is played for laughs a bit too often.

    I should have wrote this review about a month ago when i first saw the movie however i kept just putting it off for no reason. So Johnny Depp is the " man " I'm serious and this film shows his acting skills through dialogue , feelings , emotions and movements. I know its not like his other more popular movies like Pirates of the Caribbean , Edward Scissorhands and others but this one has a special place. This movie is all about loving each other and taking care of another person like Benny was trying to do for joon - I was trying to figure were his mind was at for majority of the film and I'm glad of the outcome because you could tell what his feelings toward Sam were overtime of the film. Joon was very interesting herself - mentally ill yet so artistic seems only right her and a guy like BuStEr kEaToN ( Sam ) would have a connection. I also really liked the scene of them trusting each other and feeling comfortable enough to make real love with one another . In my opinion it was great not seeing private parts it was not needed for the movie , If they would have shown skin it would have seemed to romantic or to open or to pushy or trying to hard for that scene. Its so obvious that Depp did a great job as this quirky / silly / warm hearted / caring / unique character. Benny & Joon's actors also give a good performance I'm not sure how well Aiden and MsM ( Mary s masterson ) would / have done in other movies but in this one they do well and even better when in scenes with Depp. Also I loved the song " 500 miles" they used in the beginning and ending which matched perfectly and had the song in my head all night ! This movie has an amazing three characters and actors -1= some what plays the straight man Benny who changes - 2 = mentally ill yet creative Joon and 3 = wonderful and different one of a kind Sam a guy like buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin ,soundtrack great and overall a happy movie with tons of laughs till the last scene. My family ( even my mom who dislikes a lot of movies loved this one) - especially the ending of this quirky / cute / comedy movie. I recommend this movie go watch it !!

    Searching round online for a friend recently, who was after any info related to a Bollywood movie called Barfi!,I was surprised to discover,that the new Bollywood title seemed to have been greatly inspired by a near forgotten 1993 Rom-Com Drama starring Johnny Depp.With being very interested in discovering where the Bollywood movie took its inspiration from,I decided that it was a good time to pay Benny and Joon a hopefully special visit. The plot: Finding it increasingly difficult to look after his mentally ill sister Juniper "Joon" Pearl,Benjamin "Benny" Pearl decides to pay a visit to the family's doctor (Dr.Garvey),in the hope that she can find a solution so that Benny can continue to look after Joon and keep a grip on his job as a mechanic. With having always been impressed with how Benny has coped with the pressure of looking after his sister,ever since their parents tragically died in a car crash 12 years ago,Dr.Garvey advises Benjamin that it might be a good idea if he allowed for some "space" to be created between himself and Jupier,by allowing Joon to go into a group home.Feeling uneasy about Garvey's suggestion,Benjamin promises her that he will think about the idea,quickly leaves Garvey's office,and heads home to Joon. Giving up on finding someone who can take care of his sister so that he attend a weekly poker night with his work mates,Benny decides that for the first time ever,he will take Joon along to the poker night. Pleased to see all his workmates and Joon getting on with each other,Benny decides to leave the table so that he can sort out some food.Returning to the table,Benjamin is shocked to find out that Juniper is playing an intense game of poker with a work buddy of his called Mike. Demanding that the game is stopped,Benny discovers that he is to late,when Joon reveals her game-losing hand.Prepairing to pay up Joon's debt,Benny is left speechless when Mike tells him that the bet does not involve money,but instead involves Benny having to take care of Mike's mentally ill cousin called Sam. View on the film: Showing signs of what could have been if he had not had a terrible double knock-out in his film career with Diabolique and the infamous 1998 box office bomb The Avengers, (which,in the guys defence,was re-cut against his wishes by the studio)director Jeremiah S.Chechik uses long,elegant zoom takes which allow the natural chemistry that the actors/character have with each other to be placed right at the front of the movie,with the long tacks also allowing for subtle changes in the body language from each of the characters to rise to the suffice. Along with the classy,long zoom takes and filling the soundtrack with some prime Grunge cuts, (with one of the highlights being a song used from the great band Temple of the Dog)Chechik and cinematography John Schwartzman keep any dark colours firmly isolated to the movies one flashback scenes,so that they can scatter the film with light colours,that along with connecting to Joon's interest in art,also gives the film an irresistible breezy atmosphere. Keeping away from the traditional route of Rom-Com Drama's where a boo- hiss baddie does everything to tear the characters apart,the excellent screenplay by Barry Berman and Lesley McNeil instead shows each of the characters to be flawed,but good hearted people,with the terrific group of supporting actors (William H.Macy,Oliver Platt and Joe Grifasi) emphasising the tight-knitted community that Berman and McNeil build in the screenplay. Taking things in a pretty original direction by making Benny and Joon brother and sister instead of lovers,Berman and McNeil show the family bond to run strong between each of them,with Joon trying to sort out a date for Benny,and Benny doing his best to handle the problems relate to Joon's mental difficulty due to how much he cares about his sister,which also strongly makes the important,non-preachy central message of the film that people with mental problems or learning difficulties should be treated with the same amount of respect that others receives. Shuffling into the film with the spirit of Buster Keaton in his wings,Johnny Depp gives a splendid performance as Sam,with Depp performing a number of eye-catching,Keaton inspired stunts himself.Along with the impressive stunt work,Depp also does very well at showing Sam slowly break out of his timed shell,as he finds himself,initially unknowingly building a strong connection between Benny and Joon,with Joon's mental problems allowing Sam to feel that he has met someone who he can deeply relate to. Placed at the heart of the movie,Mary Stuart Masterson and Aidan Quinn each give great performances that compliment Benny and Joon's strahants and weaknesses,with Quinn giving a big warm hearted performance as Benny,who he shows is starting to feel distraught over being unable to find a away to deal with Joons difficulties,and Masterson showing Joon trying to deal with her mental problems,with the help of her loyal brother Benny and "new" family member Sam.

Unfortunately, 'Benny & Joon's biggest asset is also its undoing, and that is the wonderful and charismatic performance of young Johnny Depp. Depp enters the scene almost halfway through as Joon's love interest, the mentally unbalanced but extremely charming Sam who chooses to model his personality (or lack thereof) on silent comedy stars Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Sam swoops Joon off her feet and disrupts the delicate balance of the siblings' relationship, which forces Benny to face up and decide whether he can let Joon go or not. Depp is terrific in his role; in one extended scene where he showcases his slapstick abilities he proves just how much of a screen personality he was and why he became one of the most bankable movie stars of the 90's. The problem is that he's so charismatic that he can easily fool the audience (and often does) that Sam is a romantic hero rather than a disruptive, chaotic presence; that this is the love story of Joon and Sam, rather than the story of Benny and his coming to terms with his own life decisions. What's worse, Depp's charisma emphasizes just how pale and unimpressive Aidan Quinn is in the role that should have been the lead. It's not a bad film; it's a pretty and touching little drama, wonderfully scripted. On the other hand, Depp's scenes are a pleasure to behold. But the contrast between the two is what ultimately makes it a failure. It doesn't help that Chechik can't quite make up his mind about how seriously he's taking Joon's mental illness, which is played for laughs a bit too often.

    I should have wrote this review about a month ago when i first saw the movie however i kept just putting it off for no reason. So Johnny Depp is the " man " I'm serious and this film shows his acting skills through dialogue , feelings , emotions and movements. I know its not like his other more popular movies like Pirates of the Caribbean , Edward Scissorhands and others but this one has a special place. This movie is all about loving each other and taking care of another person like Benny was trying to do for joon - I was trying to figure were his mind was at for majority of the film and I'm glad of the outcome because you could tell what his feelings toward Sam were overtime of the film. Joon was very interesting herself - mentally ill yet so artistic seems only right her and a guy like BuStEr kEaToN ( Sam ) would have a connection. I also really liked the scene of them trusting each other and feeling comfortable enough to make real love with one another . In my opinion it was great not seeing private parts it was not needed for the movie , If they would have shown skin it would have seemed to romantic or to open or to pushy or trying to hard for that scene. Its so obvious that Depp did a great job as this quirky / silly / warm hearted / caring / unique character. Benny & Joon's actors also give a good performance I'm not sure how well Aiden and MsM ( Mary s masterson ) would / have done in other movies but in this one they do well and even better when in scenes with Depp. Also I loved the song " 500 miles" they used in the beginning and ending which matched perfectly and had the song in my head all night ! This movie has an amazing three characters and actors -1= some what plays the straight man Benny who changes - 2 = mentally ill yet creative Joon and 3 = wonderful and different one of a kind Sam a guy like buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin ,soundtrack great and overall a happy movie with tons of laughs till the last scene. My family ( even my mom who dislikes a lot of movies loved this one) - especially the ending of this quirky / cute / comedy movie. I recommend this movie go watch it !!

    Searching round online for a friend recently, who was after any info related to a Bollywood movie called Barfi!,I was surprised to discover,that the new Bollywood title seemed to have been greatly inspired by a near forgotten 1993 Rom-Com Drama starring Johnny Depp.With being very interested in discovering where the Bollywood movie took its inspiration from,I decided that it was a good time to pay Benny and Joon a hopefully special visit. The plot: Finding it increasingly difficult to look after his mentally ill sister Juniper "Joon" Pearl,Benjamin "Benny" Pearl decides to pay a visit to the family's doctor (Dr.Garvey),in the hope that she can find a solution so that Benny can continue to look after Joon and keep a grip on his job as a mechanic. With having always been impressed with how Benny has coped with the pressure of looking after his sister,ever since their parents tragically died in a car crash 12 years ago,Dr.Garvey advises Benjamin that it might be a good idea if he allowed for some "space" to be created between himself and Jupier,by allowing Joon to go into a group home.Feeling uneasy about Garvey's suggestion,Benjamin promises her that he will think about the idea,quickly leaves Garvey's office,and heads home to Joon. Giving up on finding someone who can take care of his sister so that he attend a weekly poker night with his work mates,Benny decides that for the first time ever,he will take Joon along to the poker night. Pleased to see all his workmates and Joon getting on with each other,Benny decides to leave the table so that he can sort out some food.Returning to the table,Benjamin is shocked to find out that Juniper is playing an intense game of poker with a work buddy of his called Mike. Demanding that the game is stopped,Benny discovers that he is to late,when Joon reveals her game-losing hand.Prepairing to pay up Joon's debt,Benny is left speechless when Mike tells him that the bet does not involve money,but instead involves Benny having to take care of Mike's mentally ill cousin called Sam. View on the film: Showing signs of what could have been if he had not had a terrible double knock-out in his film career with Diabolique and the infamous 1998 box office bomb The Avengers, (which,in the guys defence,was re-cut against his wishes by the studio)director Jeremiah S.Chechik uses long,elegant zoom takes which allow the natural chemistry that the actors/character have with each other to be placed right at the front of the movie,with the long tacks also allowing for subtle changes in the body language from each of the characters to rise to the suffice. Along with the classy,long zoom takes and filling the soundtrack with some prime Grunge cuts, (with one of the highlights being a song used from the great band Temple of the Dog)Chechik and cinematography John Schwartzman keep any dark colours firmly isolated to the movies one flashback scenes,so that they can scatter the film with light colours,that along with connecting to Joon's interest in art,also gives the film an irresistible breezy atmosphere. Keeping away from the traditional route of Rom-Com Drama's where a boo- hiss baddie does everything to tear the characters apart,the excellent screenplay by Barry Berman and Lesley McNeil instead shows each of the characters to be flawed,but good hearted people,with the terrific group of supporting actors (William H.Macy,Oliver Platt and Joe Grifasi) emphasising the tight-knitted community that Berman and McNeil build in the screenplay. Taking things in a pretty original direction by making Benny and Joon brother and sister instead of lovers,Berman and McNeil show the family bond to run strong between each of them,with Joon trying to sort out a date for Benny,and Benny doing his best to handle the problems relate to Joon's mental difficulty due to how much he cares about his sister,which also strongly makes the important,non-preachy central message of the film that people with mental problems or learning difficulties should be treated with the same amount of respect that others receives. Shuffling into the film with the spirit of Buster Keaton in his wings,Johnny Depp gives a splendid performance as Sam,with Depp performing a number of eye-catching,Keaton inspired stunts himself.Along with the impressive stunt work,Depp also does very well at showing Sam slowly break out of his timed shell,as he finds himself,initially unknowingly building a strong connection between Benny and Joon,with Joon's mental problems allowing Sam to feel that he has met someone who he can deeply relate to. Placed at the heart of the movie,Mary Stuart Masterson and Aidan Quinn each give great performances that compliment Benny and Joon's strahants and weaknesses,with Quinn giving a big warm hearted performance as Benny,who he shows is starting to feel distraught over being unable to find a away to deal with Joons difficulties,and Masterson showing Joon trying to deal with her mental problems,with the help of her loyal brother Benny and "new" family member Sam.

    "Benny & Joon" remains distinctive 20 years later for its handling of mental illness, choosing boldly not to preoccupy itself with a clinical approach and instead to focus on its impact on relationships. But really, it's Johnny Depp who makes it a memorable film. The least interesting of the three main characters is the protagonist in this film, Aidan Quinn's Benny. Benny is the blue collar older brother of the mentally unstable Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), an artist prone to fits including throwing things and pyromania. Both are adults, but Joon obviously needs to be cared for as if a child. After her most recent caretaker quites, Benny finds himself forced to think about sending Joon to a living community, but plans are stalled when an unusual young man ends up in their lives. Sam (Depp) is an eccentric, a young man who models his behavior off silent film star Buster Keaton and performs various physical comedy gags both on purpose yet also intuitively. He charms Joon and after awhile even manages to impress Benny, but he slowly starts to complicate the dynamic between brother and sister. Depp's performance exhibits Keaton but also Gene Wilder ala "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." He's a joy to watch and an absolute natural when it comes to quirkiness. Although audiences had a taste of his talent in "Edward Scissorhands," it's this film where he shows just how excellent of a physical actor he is, foretelling of his eventual mainstream success. Interesting that Depp gets top billing in the credits when it's a film mostly centered on how Benny will deal with Joon. Perhaps "Christmas Vacation" director Jeremiah S. Chechik didn't realize until into filming how great of a performance he was going to get. Regardless, the script from Berry Berman and Lesley McNeil certainly didn't account for it. We spend too much time watching Benny mishandle Joon as well as his personal life despite his good heart and best intentions. A side plot he has with Julianne Moore as the waitress Ruthie completely detracts from the characters that should be getting more screen time, and it's frustrating because their conflict is handled with such immaturity on the part of both characters. With Joon's disorder not diagnosed for the audience, Masterson has little to draw upon for her performance, but she endears us to Joon with a wide-eyed approach whenever she's not throwing a tantrum. Her preoccupation with a man who also has his quirks but wears them so proudly makes a lot of sense, but we don't get to see their relationship blossom with so much of the film spent following Benny around. It's unclear whether writer Berman intended to have the other characters who aren't Joon make poor decisions about their lives in order to make a point. On one hand, such a notion would be wise and true to a certain degree, but on the other, the decisions are so rash that one has to question the authenticity of the characters. "Benny & Joon" mostly sees all its conflict underdeveloped, but the story generates enough curiosity to last the length of the film (though it could really be shorter). Depp's convincing and unusual turn brings a certain life, energy and most importantly memorability to the film, a comedy angle that the film sorely needs. Its approach to conflict is not serious enough to consider it a drama, but it's not nearly romantic enough to be considered a romance. Understandably, it's remembered as a comedy. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more

    I wasn't expecting too much from this but it turned out to be a lot more heart warming and touching of a movie then I would've thought. The story is about a girl with a mental illness, her protective brother and a slightly child like man-child who is talented in a Buster Keaton kind of way. This is a role unlike anything else you've seen Johnny Depp in. Mary Stuart Masterson has a very well layered role and Aidan Quinn plays her protective older brother. Julianne Moore in one of her first roles plays a waitress at the local diner who's a failed actress who's come home from an attempt in Los Angeles that didn't go as well as she had hoped.

    Benny & Joon is a romantic comedy film about how two eccentric individuals, Sam and Juniper,also known as "Joon",who find each other and fall in love.It stars Johnny Depp,Mary Stuart Masterson,Aidan Quinn together with William H. Macy,Julianne Moore and Oliver Platt.It was written by Barry Berman and Lesley McNeil; and it was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. Benny runs a small car repair shop. He must also take care of his mentally ill sister Juniper, better known as Joon. After losing a bet, Benny is forced to bring another eccentric into his house.His name is Sam, the cousin of a friend. Not inclined to conversation, Sam expresses himself by performing Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines.Not surprisingly, he immediately hits it off with Joon. As Sam and Joon fall deeper in love, Benny for the first time in life experiences the pangs of jealousy. Good acting,funny plot and great characters.Although there are some problems in the script and directing,the performances of the cast overshadowed them particularly Johnny Depp,who did extremely well as a physical comedian.His portrayal of Sam is delicately touching, a maladjusted waif with both soul and grit.Watch this for his performance alone.Added to that,Mary Stuart Masterson resists the temptation to soften Joon. That in itself made this movie compelling and worth watching.

    The part for Johnny Depp was tailor-made. As a Buster Keaton look-alike and showing amazing talents, Depp would go on to a career with strong performances as way-out characters. This film is no exception. A very challenged mentally ill woman finds love with the Depp character. Her protective brother can't see it until he realizes that he also has a life to live-in this case with Julianne Moore. The film proves that mentally challenged people can find happiness under certain circumstances. If possible, they must be given the freedom to pursue this. Moore is excellent in the role as the mentally challenged woman. Her total breakdown on the bus was a scene of rare quality. As the brother, Aidan Quinn is totally sympathetic in the part. There are certainly comical breaks in this challenging film.

    I would say this film was pretty much a clich&eacute;. Two strange people fall in love in this mainstream society. But there were some interesting aspects: for example, there was not too many mushy-mushy moments of verbally expressing love (I really can't stand that in films!); also, the actors were believable and did not over do it. But overall, the film didn't give any insight on new ideas and just focused on a standard topic of "forbidden love", and was pretty much predictable all the way till the end just like all Hollywood films. As a Johnny Depp fan, I don't regret watching it, but it is not a movie I would recommend to anyone.

    Today "Benny and Joon", a 1993 romantic comedy, is mostly remembered for an oddball performance by actor Johnny Depp, who plays a young man with a fondness for impersonating silent Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines. Depp can't touch Chaplin or Keaton, but his character is at times heartwarming. Depp fangals adore the film, particularly the way Depp risks life and limb for his woman, sticking by her side no matter what. The ladies love it. The film features an early performance by the always interesting Julianne Moore. Like Depp's character, hers is a meta-roll, Moore a good actress playing a bad actress who gave up bad acting to be a good waiter. Most of the film is filler, but Moore and Depp elevate things. Depp would make a career out of playing oddball characters. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    It's a shame that this film is not very popular. At least I only know very few people who have watched this wonderful movie. But it is really worth watching, as the story is beautiful and heartwarming; the music is lovely; Mary Stuart Masterson's, Johnny Depp's and Aidan Quinn's acting is brilliant; there are scenes that are unforgettable; sad, funny, extraordinary and touching moments; and this film makes you love mentally ill people. It shows that they are 'normal', sometimes they just do things in a different way than we do (e.g. making toast or cleaning the house) and that they can have amazing talents that you would never expect. Benny&Joon is definitely one of my favourites and I recommend it to everybody who does not necessarily need a lot of action etc. in a movie.

    I should have wrote this review about a month ago when i first saw the movie however i kept just putting it off for no reason. So Johnny Depp is the " man " I'm serious and this film shows his acting skills through dialogue , feelings , emotions and movements. I know its not like his other more popular movies like Pirates of the Caribbean , Edward Scissorhands and others but this one has a special place. This movie is all about loving each other and taking care of another person like Benny was trying to do for joon - I was trying to figure were his mind was at for majority of the film and I'm glad of the outcome because you could tell what his feelings toward Sam were overtime of the film. Joon was very interesting herself - mentally ill yet so artistic seems only right her and a guy like BuStEr kEaToN ( Sam ) would have a connection.

In my opinion it was great not seeing private parts it was not needed for the movie , If they would have shown skin it would have seemed to romantic or to open or to pushy or trying to hard for that scene. Its so obvious that Depp did a great job as this quirky / silly / warm hearted / caring / unique character. Benny & Joon's actors also give a good performance I'm not sure how well Aiden and MsM ( Mary s masterson ) would / have done in other movies but in this one they do well and even better when in scenes with Depp. Also I loved the song " 500 miles" they used in the beginning and ending which matched perfectly and had the song in my head all night ! This movie has an amazing three characters and actors -1= some what plays the straight man Benny who changes - 2 = mentally ill yet creative Joon and 3 = wonderful and different one of a kind Sam a guy like buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin ,soundtrack great and overall a happy movie with tons of laughs till the last scene. My family ( even my mom who dislikes a lot of movies loved this one) - especially the ending of this quirky / cute / comedy movie. I recommend this movie go watch it !!

    I wasn't expecting too much from this but it turned out to be a lot more heart warming and touching of a movie then I would've thought. The story is about a girl with a mental illness, her protective brother and a slightly child like man-child who is talented in a Buster Keaton kind of way. This is a role unlike anything else you've seen Johnny Depp in. Mary Stuart Masterson has a very well layered role and Aidan Quinn plays her protective older brother. Julianne Moore in one of her first roles plays a waitress at the local diner who's a failed actress who's come home from an attempt in Los Angeles that didn't go as well as she had hoped.

    Benny & Joon is a romantic comedy film about how two eccentric individuals, Sam and Juniper,also known as "Joon",who find each other and fall in love.It stars Johnny Depp,Mary Stuart Masterson,Aidan Quinn together with William H. Macy,Julianne Moore and Oliver Platt.It was written by Barry Berman and Lesley McNeil; and it was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. Benny runs a small car repair shop. He must also take care of his mentally ill sister Juniper, better known as Joon. After losing a bet, Benny is forced to bring another eccentric into his house.His name is Sam, the cousin of a friend. Not inclined to conversation, Sam expresses himself by performing Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines.Not surprisingly, he immediately hits it off with Joon. As Sam and Joon fall deeper in love, Benny for the first time in life experiences the pangs of jealousy. Good acting,funny plot and great characters.Although there are some problems in the script and directing,the performances of the cast overshadowed them particularly Johnny Depp,who did extremely well as a physical comedian.His portrayal of Sam is delicately touching, a maladjusted waif with both soul and grit.Watch this for his performance alone.Added to that,Mary Stuart Masterson resists the temptation to soften Joon. That in itself made this movie compelling and worth watching.

    The part for Johnny Depp was tailor-made. As a Buster Keaton look-alike and showing amazing talents, Depp would go on to a career with strong performances as way-out characters. This film is no exception. A very challenged mentally ill woman finds love with the Depp character. Her protective brother can't see it until he realizes that he also has a life to live-in this case with Julianne Moore. The film proves that mentally challenged people can find happiness under certain circumstances. If possible, they must be given the freedom to pursue this. Moore is excellent in the role as the mentally challenged woman. Her total breakdown on the bus was a scene of rare quality. As the brother, Aidan Quinn is totally sympathetic in the part. There are certainly comical breaks in this challenging film.

    I would say this film was pretty much a clich&eacute;. Two strange people fall in love in this mainstream society. But there were some interesting aspects: for example, there was not too many mushy-mushy moments of verbally expressing love (I really can't stand that in films!); also, the actors were believable and did not over do it. But overall, the film didn't give any insight on new ideas and just focused on a standard topic of "forbidden love", and was pretty much predictable all the way till the end just like all Hollywood films. As a Johnny Depp fan, I don't regret watching it, but it is not a movie I would recommend to anyone.

    Today "Benny and Joon", a 1993 romantic comedy, is mostly remembered for an oddball performance by actor Johnny Depp, who plays a young man with a fondness for impersonating silent Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines. Depp can't touch Chaplin or Keaton, but his character is at times heartwarming. Depp fangals adore the film, particularly the way Depp risks life and limb for his woman, sticking by her side no matter what. The ladies love it. The film features an early performance by the always interesting Julianne Moore. Like Depp's character, hers is a meta-roll, Moore a good actress playing a bad actress who gave up bad acting to be a good waiter. Most of the film is filler, but Moore and Depp elevate things. Depp would make a career out of playing oddball characters. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    It's a shame that this film is not very popular. At least I only know very few people who have watched this wonderful movie. But it is really worth watching, as the story is beautiful and heartwarming; the music is lovely; Mary Stuart Masterson's, Johnny Depp's and Aidan Quinn's acting is brilliant; there are scenes that are unforgettable; sad, funny, extraordinary and touching moments; and this film makes you love mentally ill people. It shows that they are 'normal', sometimes they just do things in a different way than we do (e.g. making toast or cleaning the house) and that they can have amazing talents that you would never expect. Benny&Joon is definitely one of my favourites and I recommend it to everybody who does not necessarily need a lot of action etc. in a movie.

    At the heart of 'Benny & Joon' is the story of Joon, a mentally ill young woman, and her older brother Benny, who takes constant care of her and, while complaining about how much that complicates his life, actually uses the obligation as an excuse for the fact that his own life is going nowhere. It's a story that's simple, realistic and painfully honest. It could have made for a touching little drama if only Chechik made a clean decision that that's what the film is about. Unfortunately, 'Benny & Joon's biggest asset is also its undoing, and that is the wonderful and charismatic performance of young Johnny Depp. Depp enters the scene almost halfway through as Joon's love interest, the mentally unbalanced but extremely charming Sam who chooses to model his personality (or lack thereof) on silent comedy stars Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Sam swoops Joon off her feet and disrupts the delicate balance of the siblings' relationship, which forces Benny to face up and decide whether he can let Joon go or not. Depp is terrific in his role; in one extended scene where he showcases his slapstick abilities he proves just how much of a screen personality he was and why he became one of the most bankable movie stars of the 90's. The problem is that he's so charismatic that he can easily fool the audience (and often does) that Sam is a romantic hero rather than a disruptive, chaotic presence; that this is the love story of Joon and Sam, rather than the story of Benny and his coming to terms with his own life decisions. What's worse, Depp's charisma emphasizes just how pale and unimpressive Aidan Quinn is in the role that should have been the lead. It's not a bad film; it's a pretty and touching little drama, wonderfully scripted. On the other hand, Depp's scenes are a pleasure to behold. But the contrast between the two is what ultimately makes it a failure. It doesn't help that Chechik can't quite make up his mind about how seriously he's taking Joon's mental illness, which is played for laughs a bit too often.

    I should have wrote this review about a month ago when i first saw the movie however i kept just putting it off for no reason. So Johnny Depp is the " man " I'm serious and this film shows his acting skills through dialogue , feelings , emotions and movements. I know its not like his other more popular movies like Pirates of the Caribbean , Edward Scissorhands and others but this one has a special place. This movie is all about loving each other and taking care of another person like Benny was trying to do for joon - I was trying to figure were his mind was at for majority of the film and I'm glad of the outcome because you could tell what his feelings toward Sam were overtime of the film. Joon was very interesting herself - mentally ill yet so artistic seems only right her and a guy like BuStEr kEaToN ( Sam ) would have a connection. I also really liked the scene of them trusting each other and feeling comfortable enough to make real love with one another . In my opinion it was great not seeing private parts it was not needed for the movie , If they would have shown skin it would have seemed to romantic or to open or to pushy or trying to hard for that scene. Its so obvious that Depp did a great job as this quirky / silly / warm hearted / caring / unique character. Benny & Joon's actors also give a good performance I'm not sure how well Aiden and MsM ( Mary s masterson ) would / have done in other movies but in this one they do well and even better when in scenes with Depp. Also I loved the song " 500 miles" they used in the beginning and ending which matched perfectly and had the song in my head all night ! This movie has an amazing three characters and actors -1= some what plays the straight man Benny who changes - 2 = mentally ill yet creative Joon and 3 = wonderful and different one of a kind Sam a guy like buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin ,soundtrack great and overall a happy movie with tons of laughs till the last scene. My family ( even my mom who dislikes a lot of movies loved this one) - especially the ending of this quirky / cute / comedy movie. I recommend this movie go watch it !!

    Searching round online for a friend recently, who was after any info related to a Bollywood movie called Barfi!,I was surprised to discover,that the new Bollywood title seemed to have been greatly inspired by a near forgotten 1993 Rom-Com Drama starring Johnny Depp.With being very interested in discovering where the Bollywood movie took its inspiration from,I decided that it was a good time to pay Benny and Joon a hopefully special visit. The plot: Finding it increasingly difficult to look after his mentally ill sister Juniper "Joon" Pearl,Benjamin "Benny" Pearl decides to pay a visit to the family's doctor (Dr.Garvey),in the hope that she can find a solution so that Benny can continue to look after Joon and keep a grip on his job as a mechanic. With having always been impressed with how Benny has coped with the pressure of looking after his sister,ever since their parents tragically died in a car crash 12 years ago,Dr.Garvey advises Benjamin that it might be a good idea if he allowed for some "space" to be created between himself and Jupier,by allowing Joon to go into a group home.Feeling uneasy about Garvey's suggestion,Benjamin promises her that he will think about the idea,quickly leaves Garvey's office,and heads home to Joon. Giving up on finding someone who can take care of his sister so that he attend a weekly poker night with his work mates,Benny decides that for the first time ever,he will take Joon along to the poker night. Pleased to see all his workmates and Joon getting on with each other,Benny decides to leave the table so that he can sort out some food.Returning to the table,Benjamin is shocked to find out that Juniper is playing an intense game of poker with a work buddy of his called Mike. Demanding that the game is stopped,Benny discovers that he is to late,when Joon reveals her game-losing hand.Prepairing to pay up Joon's debt,Benny is left speechless when Mike tells him that the bet does not involve money,but instead involves Benny having to take care of Mike's mentally ill cousin called Sam. View on the film: Showing signs of what could have been if he had not had a terrible double knock-out in his film career with Diabolique and the infamous 1998 box office bomb The Avengers, (which,in the guys defence,was re-cut against his wishes by the studio)director Jeremiah S.Chechik uses long,elegant zoom takes which allow the natural chemistry that the actors/character have with each other to be placed right at the front of the movie,with the long tacks also allowing for subtle changes in the body language from each of the characters to rise to the suffice. Along with the classy,long zoom takes and filling the soundtrack with some prime Grunge cuts, (with one of the highlights being a song used from the great band Temple of the Dog)Chechik and cinematography John Schwartzman keep any dark colours firmly isolated to the movies one flashback scenes,so that they can scatter the film with light colours,that along with connecting to Joon's interest in art,also gives the film an irresistible breezy atmosphere. Keeping away from the traditional route of Rom-Com Drama's where a boo- hiss baddie does everything to tear the characters apart,the excellent screenplay by Barry Berman and Lesley McNeil instead shows each of the characters to be flawed,but good hearted people,with the terrific group of supporting actors (William H.Macy,Oliver Platt and Joe Grifasi) emphasising the tight-knitted community that Berman and McNeil build in the screenplay. Taking things in a pretty original direction by making Benny and Joon brother and sister instead of lovers,Berman and McNeil show the family bond to run strong between each of them,with Joon trying to sort out a date for Benny,and Benny doing his best to handle the problems relate to Joon's mental difficulty due to how much he cares about his sister,which also strongly makes the important,non-preachy central message of the film that people with mental problems or learning difficulties should be treated with the same amount of respect that others receives. Shuffling into the film with the spirit of Buster Keaton in his wings,Johnny Depp gives a splendid performance as Sam,with Depp performing a number of eye-catching,Keaton inspired stunts himself.Along with the impressive stunt work,Depp also does very well at showing Sam slowly break out of his timed shell,as he finds himself,initially unknowingly building a strong connection between Benny and Joon,with Joon's mental problems allowing Sam to feel that he has met someone who he can deeply relate to. Placed at the heart of the movie,Mary Stuart Masterson and Aidan Quinn each give great performances that compliment Benny and Joon's strahants and weaknesses,with Quinn giving a big warm hearted performance as Benny,who he shows is starting to feel distraught over being unable to find a away to deal with Joons difficulties,and Masterson showing Joon trying to deal with her mental problems,with the help of her loyal brother Benny and "new" family member Sam.

    "Benny & Joon" remains distinctive 20 years later for its handling of mental illness, choosing boldly not to preoccupy itself with a clinical approach and instead to focus on its impact on relationships. But really, it's Johnny Depp who makes it a memorable film. The least interesting of the three main characters is the protagonist in this film, Aidan Quinn's Benny. Benny is the blue collar older brother of the mentally unstable Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), an artist prone to fits including throwing things and pyromania. Both are adults, but Joon obviously needs to be cared for as if a child. After her most recent caretaker quites, Benny finds himself forced to think about sending Joon to a living community, but plans are stalled when an unusual young man ends up in their lives. Sam (Depp) is an eccentric, a young man who models his behavior off silent film star Buster Keaton and performs various physical comedy gags both on purpose yet also intuitively. He charms Joon and after awhile even manages to impress Benny, but he slowly starts to complicate the dynamic between brother and sister. Depp's performance exhibits Keaton but also Gene Wilder ala "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." He's a joy to watch and an absolute natural when it comes to quirkiness. Although audiences had a taste of his talent in "Edward Scissorhands," it's this film where he shows just how excellent of a physical actor he is, foretelling of his eventual mainstream success. Interesting that Depp gets top billing in the credits when it's a film mostly centered on how Benny will deal with Joon. Perhaps "Christmas Vacation" director Jeremiah S. Chechik didn't realize until into filming how great of a performance he was going to get. Regardless, the script from Berry Berman and Lesley McNeil certainly didn't account for it. We spend too much time watching Benny mishandle Joon as well as his personal life despite his good heart and best intentions. A side plot he has with Julianne Moore as the waitress Ruthie completely detracts from the characters that should be getting more screen time, and it's frustrating because their conflict is handled with such immaturity on the part of both characters. With Joon's disorder not diagnosed for the audience, Masterson has little to draw upon for her performance, but she endears us to Joon with a wide-eyed approach whenever she's not throwing a tantrum. Her preoccupation with a man who also has his quirks but wears them so proudly makes a lot of sense, but we don't get to see their relationship blossom with so much of the film spent following Benny around. It's unclear whether writer Berman intended to have the other characters who aren't Joon make poor decisions about their lives in order to make a point. On one hand, such a notion would be wise and true to a certain degree, but on the other, the decisions are so rash that one has to question the authenticity of the characters. "Benny & Joon" mostly sees all its conflict underdeveloped, but the story generates enough curiosity to last the length of the film (though it could really be shorter). Depp's convincing and unusual turn brings a certain life, energy and most importantly memorability to the film, a comedy angle that the film sorely needs. Its approach to conflict is not serious enough to consider it a drama, but it's not nearly romantic enough to be considered a romance. Understandably, it's remembered as a comedy. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more

But it is really worth watching, as the story is beautiful and heartwarming; the music is lovely; Mary Stuart Masterson's, Johnny Depp's and Aidan Quinn's acting is brilliant; there are scenes that are unforgettable; sad, funny, extraordinary and touching moments; and this film makes you love mentally ill people.

This movie has an amazing three characters and actors -1= some what plays the straight man Benny who changes - 2 = mentally ill yet creative Joon and 3 = wonderful and different one of a kind Sam a guy like buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin ,soundtrack great and overall a happy movie with tons of laughs till the last scene. My family ( even my mom who dislikes a lot of movies loved this one) - especially the ending of this quirky / cute / comedy movie. I recommend this movie go watch it !!

With having always been impressed with how Benny has coped with the pressure of looking after his sister,ever since their parents tragically died in a car crash 12 years ago,Dr.Garvey advises Benjamin that it might be a good idea if he allowed for some "space" to be created between himself and Jupier,by allowing Joon to go into a group home.Feeling uneasy about Garvey's suggestion,Benjamin promises her that he will think about the idea,quickly leaves Garvey's office,and heads home to Joon. Giving up on finding someone who can take care of his sister so that he attend a weekly poker night with his work mates,Benny decides that for the first time ever,he will take Joon along to the poker night. Pleased to see all his workmates and Joon getting on with each other,Benny decides to leave the table so that he can sort out some food.Returning to the table,Benjamin is shocked to find out that Juniper is playing an intense game of poker with a work buddy of his called Mike. Demanding that the game is stopped,Benny discovers that he is to late,when Joon reveals her game-losing hand.Prepairing to pay up Joon's debt,Benny is left speechless when Mike tells him that the bet does not involve money,but instead involves Benny having to take care of Mike's mentally ill cousin called Sam. View on the film: Showing signs of what could have been if he had not had a terrible double knock-out in his film career with Diabolique and the infamous 1998 box office bomb The Avengers, (which,in the guys defence,was re-cut against his wishes by the studio)director Jeremiah S.Chechik uses long,elegant zoom takes which allow the natural chemistry that the actors/character have with each other to be placed right at the front of the movie,with the long tacks also allowing for subtle changes in the body language from each of the characters to rise to the suffice. Along with the classy,long zoom takes and filling the soundtrack with some prime Grunge cuts, (with one of the highlights being a song used from the great band Temple of the Dog)Chechik and cinematography John Schwartzman keep any dark colours firmly isolated to the movies one flashback scenes,so that they can scatter the film with light colours,that along with connecting to Joon's interest in art,also gives the film an irresistible breezy atmosphere. Keeping away from the traditional route of Rom-Com Drama's where a boo- hiss baddie does everything to tear the characters apart,the excellent screenplay by Barry Berman and Lesley McNeil instead shows each of the characters to be flawed,but good hearted people,with the terrific group of supporting actors (William H.Macy,Oliver Platt and Joe Grifasi) emphasising the tight-knitted community that Berman and McNeil build in the screenplay. Taking things in a pretty original direction by making Benny and Joon brother and sister instead of lovers,Berman and McNeil show the family bond to run strong between each of them,with Joon trying to sort out a date for Benny,and Benny doing his best to handle the problems relate to Joon's mental difficulty due to how much he cares about his sister,which also strongly makes the important,non-preachy central message of the film that people with mental problems or learning difficulties should be treated with the same amount of respect that others receives. Shuffling into the film with the spirit of Buster Keaton in his wings,Johnny Depp gives a splendid performance as Sam,with Depp performing a number of eye-catching,Keaton inspired stunts himself.Along with the impressive stunt work,Depp also does very well at showing Sam slowly break out of his timed shell,as he finds himself,initially unknowingly building a strong connection between Benny and Joon,with Joon's mental problems allowing Sam to feel that he has met someone who he can deeply relate to. Placed at the heart of the movie,Mary Stuart Masterson and Aidan Quinn each give great performances that compliment Benny and Joon's strahants and weaknesses,with Quinn giving a big warm hearted performance as Benny,who he shows is starting to feel distraught over being unable to find a away to deal with Joons difficulties,and Masterson showing Joon trying to deal with her mental problems,with the help of her loyal brother Benny and "new" family member Sam.

    "Benny & Joon" remains distinctive 20 years later for its handling of mental illness, choosing boldly not to preoccupy itself with a clinical approach and instead to focus on its impact on relationships. But really, it's Johnny Depp who makes it a memorable film. The least interesting of the three main characters is the protagonist in this film, Aidan Quinn's Benny. Benny is the blue collar older brother of the mentally unstable Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), an artist prone to fits including throwing things and pyromania. Both are adults, but Joon obviously needs to be cared for as if a child. After her most recent caretaker quites, Benny finds himself forced to think about sending Joon to a living community, but plans are stalled when an unusual young man ends up in their lives. Sam (Depp) is an eccentric, a young man who models his behavior off silent film star Buster Keaton and performs various physical comedy gags both on purpose yet also intuitively. He charms Joon and after awhile even manages to impress Benny, but he slowly starts to complicate the dynamic between brother and sister. Depp's performance exhibits Keaton but also Gene Wilder ala "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." He's a joy to watch and an absolute natural when it comes to quirkiness. Although audiences had a taste of his talent in "Edward Scissorhands," it's this film where he shows just how excellent of a physical actor he is, foretelling of his eventual mainstream success. Interesting that Depp gets top billing in the credits when it's a film mostly centered on how Benny will deal with Joon. Perhaps "Christmas Vacation" director Jeremiah S. Chechik didn't realize until into filming how great of a performance he was going to get. Regardless, the script from Berry Berman and Lesley McNeil certainly didn't account for it. We spend too much time watching Benny mishandle Joon as well as his personal life despite his good heart and best intentions. A side plot he has with Julianne Moore as the waitress Ruthie completely detracts from the characters that should be getting more screen time, and it's frustrating because their conflict is handled with such immaturity on the part of both characters. With Joon's disorder not diagnosed for the audience, Masterson has little to draw upon for her performance, but she endears us to Joon with a wide-eyed approach whenever she's not throwing a tantrum. Her preoccupation with a man who also has his quirks but wears them so proudly makes a lot of sense, but we don't get to see their relationship blossom with so much of the film spent following Benny around. It's unclear whether writer Berman intended to have the other characters who aren't Joon make poor decisions about their lives in order to make a point. On one hand, such a notion would be wise and true to a certain degree, but on the other, the decisions are so rash that one has to question the authenticity of the characters. "Benny & Joon" mostly sees all its conflict underdeveloped, but the story generates enough curiosity to last the length of the film (though it could really be shorter). Depp's convincing and unusual turn brings a certain life, energy and most importantly memorability to the film, a comedy angle that the film sorely needs. Its approach to conflict is not serious enough to consider it a drama, but it's not nearly romantic enough to be considered a romance. Understandably, it's remembered as a comedy. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more

    I wasn't expecting too much from this but it turned out to be a lot more heart warming and touching of a movie then I would've thought. The story is about a girl with a mental illness, her protective brother and a slightly child like man-child who is talented in a Buster Keaton kind of way. This is a role unlike anything else you've seen Johnny Depp in. Mary Stuart Masterson has a very well layered role and Aidan Quinn plays her protective older brother. Julianne Moore in one of her first roles plays a waitress at the local diner who's a failed actress who's come home from an attempt in Los Angeles that didn't go as well as she had hoped.

    Benny & Joon is a romantic comedy film about how two eccentric individuals, Sam and Juniper,also known as "Joon",who find each other and fall in love.It stars Johnny Depp,Mary Stuart Masterson,Aidan Quinn together with William H. Macy,Julianne Moore and Oliver Platt.It was written by Barry Berman and Lesley McNeil; and it was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. Benny runs a small car repair shop. He must also take care of his mentally ill sister Juniper, better known as Joon. After losing a bet, Benny is forced to bring another eccentric into his house.His name is Sam, the cousin of a friend. Not inclined to conversation, Sam expresses himself by performing Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines.Not surprisingly, he immediately hits it off with Joon. As Sam and Joon fall deeper in love, Benny for the first time in life experiences the pangs of jealousy. Good acting,funny plot and great characters.Although there are some problems in the script and directing,the performances of the cast overshadowed them particularly Johnny Depp,who did extremely well as a physical comedian.His portrayal of Sam is delicately touching, a maladjusted waif with both soul and grit.Watch this for his performance alone.Added to that,Mary Stuart Masterson resists the temptation to soften Joon. That in itself made this movie compelling and worth watching.

    The part for Johnny Depp was tailor-made. As a Buster Keaton look-alike and showing amazing talents, Depp would go on to a career with strong performances as way-out characters. This film is no exception. A very challenged mentally ill woman finds love with the Depp character. Her protective brother can't see it until he realizes that he also has a life to live-in this case with Julianne Moore. The film proves that mentally challenged people can find happiness under certain circumstances. If possible, they must be given the freedom to pursue this. Moore is excellent in the role as the mentally challenged woman. Her total breakdown on the bus was a scene of rare quality. As the brother, Aidan Quinn is totally sympathetic in the part. There are certainly comical breaks in this challenging film.

    I would say this film was pretty much a clich&eacute;. Two strange people fall in love in this mainstream society. But there were some interesting aspects: for example, there was not too many mushy-mushy moments of verbally expressing love (I really can't stand that in films!); also, the actors were believable and did not over do it. But overall, the film didn't give any insight on new ideas and just focused on a standard topic of "forbidden love", and was pretty much predictable all the way till the end just like all Hollywood films. As a Johnny Depp fan, I don't regret watching it, but it is not a movie I would recommend to anyone.

    Today "Benny and Joon", a 1993 romantic comedy, is mostly remembered for an oddball performance by actor Johnny Depp, who plays a young man with a fondness for impersonating silent Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines. Depp can't touch Chaplin or Keaton, but his character is at times heartwarming. Depp fangals adore the film, particularly the way Depp risks life and limb for his woman, sticking by her side no matter what. The ladies love it. The film features an early performance by the always interesting Julianne Moore. Like Depp's character, hers is a meta-roll, Moore a good actress playing a bad actress who gave up bad acting to be a good waiter. Most of the film is filler, but Moore and Depp elevate things. Depp would make a career out of playing oddball characters. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    It's a shame that this film is not very popular. At least I only know very few people who have watched this wonderful movie. But it is really worth watching, as the story is beautiful and heartwarming; the music is lovely; Mary Stuart Masterson's, Johnny Depp's and Aidan Quinn's acting is brilliant; there are scenes that are unforgettable; sad, funny, extraordinary and touching moments; and this film makes you love mentally ill people. It shows that they are 'normal', sometimes they just do things in a different way than we do (e.g. making toast or cleaning the house) and that they can have amazing talents that you would never expect. Benny&Joon is definitely one of my favourites and I recommend it to everybody who does not necessarily need a lot of action etc. in a movie.

    At the heart of 'Benny & Joon' is the story of Joon, a mentally ill young woman, and her older brother Benny, who takes constant care of her and, while complaining about how much that complicates his life, actually uses the obligation as an excuse for the fact that his own life is going nowhere. It's a story that's simple, realistic and painfully honest. It could have made for a touching little drama if only Chechik made a clean decision that that's what the film is about. Unfortunately, 'Benny & Joon's biggest asset is also its undoing, and that is the wonderful and charismatic performance of young Johnny Depp. Depp enters the scene almost halfway through as Joon's love interest, the mentally unbalanced but extremely charming Sam who chooses to model his personality (or lack thereof) on silent comedy stars Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Sam swoops Joon off her feet and disrupts the delicate balance of the siblings' relationship, which forces Benny to face up and decide whether he can let Joon go or not. Depp is terrific in his role; in one extended scene where he showcases his slapstick abilities he proves just how much of a screen personality he was and why he became one of the most bankable movie stars of the 90's. The problem is that he's so charismatic that he can easily fool the audience (and often does) that Sam is a romantic hero rather than a disruptive, chaotic presence; that this is the love story of Joon and Sam, rather than the story of Benny and his coming to terms with his own life decisions. What's worse, Depp's charisma emphasizes just how pale and unimpressive Aidan Quinn is in the role that should have been the lead. It's not a bad film; it's a pretty and touching little drama, wonderfully scripted. On the other hand, Depp's scenes are a pleasure to behold. But the contrast between the two is what ultimately makes it a failure. It doesn't help that Chechik can't quite make up his mind about how seriously he's taking Joon's mental illness, which is played for laughs a bit too often.

    I should have wrote this review about a month ago when i first saw the movie however i kept just putting it off for no reason. So Johnny Depp is the " man " I'm serious and this film shows his acting skills through dialogue , feelings , emotions and movements. I know its not like his other more popular movies like Pirates of the Caribbean , Edward Scissorhands and others but this one has a special place. This movie is all about loving each other and taking care of another person like Benny was trying to do for joon - I was trying to figure were his mind was at for majority of the film and I'm glad of the outcome because you could tell what his feelings toward Sam were overtime of the film. Joon was very interesting herself - mentally ill yet so artistic seems only right her and a guy like BuStEr kEaToN ( Sam ) would have a connection. I also really liked the scene of them trusting each other and feeling comfortable enough to make real love with one another . In my opinion it was great not seeing private parts it was not needed for the movie , If they would have shown skin it would have seemed to romantic or to open or to pushy or trying to hard for that scene. Its so obvious that Depp did a great job as this quirky / silly / warm hearted / caring / unique character. Benny & Joon's actors also give a good performance I'm not sure how well Aiden and MsM ( Mary s masterson ) would / have done in other movies but in this one they do well and even better when in scenes with Depp. Also I loved the song " 500 miles" they used in the beginning and ending which matched perfectly and had the song in my head all night ! This movie has an amazing three characters and actors -1= some what plays the straight man Benny who changes - 2 = mentally ill yet creative Joon and 3 = wonderful and different one of a kind Sam a guy like buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin ,soundtrack great and overall a happy movie with tons of laughs till the last scene. My family ( even my mom who dislikes a lot of movies loved this one) - especially the ending of this quirky / cute / comedy movie. I recommend this movie go watch it !!

    Today "Benny and Joon", a 1993 romantic comedy, is mostly remembered for an oddball performance by actor Johnny Depp, who plays a young man with a fondness for impersonating silent Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines. Depp can't touch Chaplin or Keaton, but his character is at times heartwarming. Depp fangals adore the film, particularly the way Depp risks life and limb for his woman, sticking by her side no matter what. The ladies love it. The film features an early performance by the always interesting Julianne Moore. Like Depp's character, hers is a meta-roll, Moore a good actress playing a bad actress who gave up bad acting to be a good waiter. Most of the film is filler, but Moore and Depp elevate things. Depp would make a career out of playing oddball characters. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    It's a shame that this film is not very popular. At least I only know very few people who have watched this wonderful movie. But it is really worth watching, as the story is beautiful and heartwarming; the music is lovely; Mary Stuart Masterson's, Johnny Depp's and Aidan Quinn's acting is brilliant; there are scenes that are unforgettable; sad, funny, extraordinary and touching moments; and this film makes you love mentally ill people. It shows that they are 'normal', sometimes they just do things in a different way than we do (e.g. making toast or cleaning the house) and that they can have amazing talents that you would never expect. Benny&Joon is definitely one of my favourites and I recommend it to everybody who does not necessarily need a lot of action etc. in a movie.

    At the heart of 'Benny & Joon' is the story of Joon, a mentally ill young woman, and her older brother Benny, who takes constant care of her and, while complaining about how much that complicates his life, actually uses the obligation as an excuse for the fact that his own life is going nowhere. It's a story that's simple, realistic and painfully honest. It could have made for a touching little drama if only Chechik made a clean decision that that's what the film is about. Unfortunately, 'Benny & Joon's biggest asset is also its undoing, and that is the wonderful and charismatic performance of young Johnny Depp. Depp enters the scene almost halfway through as Joon's love interest, the mentally unbalanced but extremely charming Sam who chooses to model his personality (or lack thereof) on silent comedy stars Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Sam swoops Joon off her feet and disrupts the delicate balance of the siblings' relationship, which forces Benny to face up and decide whether he can let Joon go or not. Depp is terrific in his role; in one extended scene where he showcases his slapstick abilities he proves just how much of a screen personality he was and why he became one of the most bankable movie stars of the 90's. The problem is that he's so charismatic that he can easily fool the audience (and often does) that Sam is a romantic hero rather than a disruptive, chaotic presence; that this is the love story of Joon and Sam, rather than the story of Benny and his coming to terms with his own life decisions. What's worse, Depp's charisma emphasizes just how pale and unimpressive Aidan Quinn is in the role that should have been the lead. It's not a bad film; it's a pretty and touching little drama, wonderfully scripted. On the other hand, Depp's scenes are a pleasure to behold. But the contrast between the two is what ultimately makes it a failure. It doesn't help that Chechik can't quite make up his mind about how seriously he's taking Joon's mental illness, which is played for laughs a bit too often.

    I should have wrote this review about a month ago when i first saw the movie however i kept just putting it off for no reason. So Johnny Depp is the " man " I'm serious and this film shows his acting skills through dialogue , feelings , emotions and movements. I know its not like his other more popular movies like Pirates of the Caribbean , Edward Scissorhands and others but this one has a special place. This movie is all about loving each other and taking care of another person like Benny was trying to do for joon - I was trying to figure were his mind was at for majority of the film and I'm glad of the outcome because you could tell what his feelings toward Sam were overtime of the film. Joon was very interesting herself - mentally ill yet so artistic seems only right her and a guy like BuStEr kEaToN ( Sam ) would have a connection. I also really liked the scene of them trusting each other and feeling comfortable enough to make real love with one another . In my opinion it was great not seeing private parts it was not needed for the movie , If they would have shown skin it would have seemed to romantic or to open or to pushy or trying to hard for that scene. Its so obvious that Depp did a great job as this quirky / silly / warm hearted / caring / unique character. Benny & Joon's actors also give a good performance I'm not sure how well Aiden and MsM ( Mary s masterson ) would / have done in other movies but in this one they do well and even better when in scenes with Depp. Also I loved the song " 500 miles" they used in the beginning and ending which matched perfectly and had the song in my head all night ! This movie has an amazing three characters and actors -1= some what plays the straight man Benny who changes - 2 = mentally ill yet creative Joon and 3 = wonderful and different one of a kind Sam a guy like buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin ,soundtrack great and overall a happy movie with tons of laughs till the last scene. My family ( even my mom who dislikes a lot of movies loved this one) - especially the ending of this quirky / cute / comedy movie. I recommend this movie go watch it !!

    Searching round online for a friend recently, who was after any info related to a Bollywood movie called Barfi!,I was surprised to discover,that the new Bollywood title seemed to have been greatly inspired by a near forgotten 1993 Rom-Com Drama starring Johnny Depp.With being very interested in discovering where the Bollywood movie took its inspiration from,I decided that it was a good time to pay Benny and Joon a hopefully special visit. The plot: Finding it increasingly difficult to look after his mentally ill sister Juniper "Joon" Pearl,Benjamin "Benny" Pearl decides to pay a visit to the family's doctor (Dr.Garvey),in the hope that she can find a solution so that Benny can continue to look after Joon and keep a grip on his job as a mechanic. With having always been impressed with how Benny has coped with the pressure of looking after his sister,ever since their parents tragically died in a car crash 12 years ago,Dr.Garvey advises Benjamin that it might be a good idea if he allowed for some "space" to be created between himself and Jupier,by allowing Joon to go into a group home.Feeling uneasy about Garvey's suggestion,Benjamin promises her that he will think about the idea,quickly leaves Garvey's office,and heads home to Joon. Giving up on finding someone who can take care of his sister so that he attend a weekly poker night with his work mates,Benny decides that for the first time ever,he will take Joon along to the poker night. Pleased to see all his workmates and Joon getting on with each other,Benny decides to leave the table so that he can sort out some food.Returning to the table,Benjamin is shocked to find out that Juniper is playing an intense game of poker with a work buddy of his called Mike. Demanding that the game is stopped,Benny discovers that he is to late,when Joon reveals her game-losing hand.Prepairing to pay up Joon's debt,Benny is left speechless when Mike tells him that the bet does not involve money,but instead involves Benny having to take care of Mike's mentally ill cousin called Sam. View on the film: Showing signs of what could have been if he had not had a terrible double knock-out in his film career with Diabolique and the infamous 1998 box office bomb The Avengers, (which,in the guys defence,was re-cut against his wishes by the studio)director Jeremiah S.Chechik uses long,elegant zoom takes which allow the natural chemistry that the actors/character have with each other to be placed right at the front of the movie,with the long tacks also allowing for subtle changes in the body language from each of the characters to rise to the suffice. Along with the classy,long zoom takes and filling the soundtrack with some prime Grunge cuts, (with one of the highlights being a song used from the great band Temple of the Dog)Chechik and cinematography John Schwartzman keep any dark colours firmly isolated to the movies one flashback scenes,so that they can scatter the film with light colours,that along with connecting to Joon's interest in art,also gives the film an irresistible breezy atmosphere. Keeping away from the traditional route of Rom-Com Drama's where a boo- hiss baddie does everything to tear the characters apart,the excellent screenplay by Barry Berman and Lesley McNeil instead shows each of the characters to be flawed,but good hearted people,with the terrific group of supporting actors (William H.Macy,Oliver Platt and Joe Grifasi) emphasising the tight-knitted community that Berman and McNeil build in the screenplay. Taking things in a pretty original direction by making Benny and Joon brother and sister instead of lovers,Berman and McNeil show the family bond to run strong between each of them,with Joon trying to sort out a date for Benny,and Benny doing his best to handle the problems relate to Joon's mental difficulty due to how much he cares about his sister,which also strongly makes the important,non-preachy central message of the film that people with mental problems or learning difficulties should be treated with the same amount of respect that others receives. Shuffling into the film with the spirit of Buster Keaton in his wings,Johnny Depp gives a splendid performance as Sam,with Depp performing a number of eye-catching,Keaton inspired stunts himself.Along with the impressive stunt work,Depp also does very well at showing Sam slowly break out of his timed shell,as he finds himself,initially unknowingly building a strong connection between Benny and Joon,with Joon's mental problems allowing Sam to feel that he has met someone who he can deeply relate to. Placed at the heart of the movie,Mary Stuart Masterson and Aidan Quinn each give great performances that compliment Benny and Joon's strahants and weaknesses,with Quinn giving a big warm hearted performance as Benny,who he shows is starting to feel distraught over being unable to find a away to deal with Joons difficulties,and Masterson showing Joon trying to deal with her mental problems,with the help of her loyal brother Benny and "new" family member Sam.

    "Benny & Joon" remains distinctive 20 years later for its handling of mental illness, choosing boldly not to preoccupy itself with a clinical approach and instead to focus on its impact on relationships. But really, it's Johnny Depp who makes it a memorable film. The least interesting of the three main characters is the protagonist in this film, Aidan Quinn's Benny. Benny is the blue collar older brother of the mentally unstable Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), an artist prone to fits including throwing things and pyromania. Both are adults, but Joon obviously needs to be cared for as if a child. After her most recent caretaker quites, Benny finds himself forced to think about sending Joon to a living community, but plans are stalled when an unusual young man ends up in their lives. Sam (Depp) is an eccentric, a young man who models his behavior off silent film star Buster Keaton and performs various physical comedy gags both on purpose yet also intuitively. He charms Joon and after awhile even manages to impress Benny, but he slowly starts to complicate the dynamic between brother and sister. Depp's performance exhibits Keaton but also Gene Wilder ala "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." He's a joy to watch and an absolute natural when it comes to quirkiness. Although audiences had a taste of his talent in "Edward Scissorhands," it's this film where he shows just how excellent of a physical actor he is, foretelling of his eventual mainstream success. Interesting that Depp gets top billing in the credits when it's a film mostly centered on how Benny will deal with Joon. Perhaps "Christmas Vacation" director Jeremiah S. Chechik didn't realize until into filming how great of a performance he was going to get. Regardless, the script from Berry Berman and Lesley McNeil certainly didn't account for it. We spend too much time watching Benny mishandle Joon as well as his personal life despite his good heart and best intentions. A side plot he has with Julianne Moore as the waitress Ruthie completely detracts from the characters that should be getting more screen time, and it's frustrating because their conflict is handled with such immaturity on the part of both characters. With Joon's disorder not diagnosed for the audience, Masterson has little to draw upon for her performance, but she endears us to Joon with a wide-eyed approach whenever she's not throwing a tantrum. Her preoccupation with a man who also has his quirks but wears them so proudly makes a lot of sense, but we don't get to see their relationship blossom with so much of the film spent following Benny around. It's unclear whether writer Berman intended to have the other characters who aren't Joon make poor decisions about their lives in order to make a point. On one hand, such a notion would be wise and true to a certain degree, but on the other, the decisions are so rash that one has to question the authenticity of the characters. "Benny & Joon" mostly sees all its conflict underdeveloped, but the story generates enough curiosity to last the length of the film (though it could really be shorter). Depp's convincing and unusual turn brings a certain life, energy and most importantly memorability to the film, a comedy angle that the film sorely needs. Its approach to conflict is not serious enough to consider it a drama, but it's not nearly romantic enough to be considered a romance. Understandably, it's remembered as a comedy. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more

    I wasn't expecting too much from this but it turned out to be a lot more heart warming and touching of a movie then I would've thought. The story is about a girl with a mental illness, her protective brother and a slightly child like man-child who is talented in a Buster Keaton kind of way. This is a role unlike anything else you've seen Johnny Depp in. Mary Stuart Masterson has a very well layered role and Aidan Quinn plays her protective older brother. Julianne Moore in one of her first roles plays a waitress at the local diner who's a failed actress who's come home from an attempt in Los Angeles that didn't go as well as she had hoped.

    Benny & Joon is a romantic comedy film about how two eccentric individuals, Sam and Juniper,also known as "Joon",who find each other and fall in love.It stars Johnny Depp,Mary Stuart Masterson,Aidan Quinn together with William H. Macy,Julianne Moore and Oliver Platt.It was written by Barry Berman and Lesley McNeil; and it was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. Benny runs a small car repair shop. He must also take care of his mentally ill sister Juniper, better known as Joon. After losing a bet, Benny is forced to bring another eccentric into his house.His name is Sam, the cousin of a friend. Not inclined to conversation, Sam expresses himself by performing Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines.Not surprisingly, he immediately hits it off with Joon. As Sam and Joon fall deeper in love, Benny for the first time in life experiences the pangs of jealousy. Good acting,funny plot and great characters.Although there are some problems in the script and directing,the performances of the cast overshadowed them particularly Johnny Depp,who did extremely well as a physical comedian.His portrayal of Sam is delicately touching, a maladjusted waif with both soul and grit.Watch this for his performance alone.Added to that,Mary Stuart Masterson resists the temptation to soften Joon. That in itself made this movie compelling and worth watching.

    The part for Johnny Depp was tailor-made. As a Buster Keaton look-alike and showing amazing talents, Depp would go on to a career with strong performances as way-out characters. This film is no exception. A very challenged mentally ill woman finds love with the Depp character. Her protective brother can't see it until he realizes that he also has a life to live-in this case with Julianne Moore. The film proves that mentally challenged people can find happiness under certain circumstances. If possible, they must be given the freedom to pursue this. Moore is excellent in the role as the mentally challenged woman. Her total breakdown on the bus was a scene of rare quality. As the brother, Aidan Quinn is totally sympathetic in the part. There are certainly comical breaks in this challenging film.

    I would say this film was pretty much a clich&eacute;. Two strange people fall in love in this mainstream society. But there were some interesting aspects: for example, there was not too many mushy-mushy moments of verbally expressing love (I really can't stand that in films!); also, the actors were believable and did not over do it. But overall, the film didn't give any insight on new ideas and just focused on a standard topic of "forbidden love", and was pretty much predictable all the way till the end just like all Hollywood films. As a Johnny Depp fan, I don't regret watching it, but it is not a movie I would recommend to anyone.

    It's a shame that this film is not very popular. At least I only know very few people who have watched this wonderful movie. But it is really worth watching, as the story is beautiful and heartwarming; the music is lovely; Mary Stuart Masterson's, Johnny Depp's and Aidan Quinn's acting is brilliant; there are scenes that are unforgettable; sad, funny, extraordinary and touching moments; and this film makes you love mentally ill people. It shows that they are 'normal', sometimes they just do things in a different way than we do (e.g. making toast or cleaning the house) and that they can have amazing talents that you would never expect. Benny&Joon is definitely one of my favourites and I recommend it to everybody who does not necessarily need a lot of action etc. in a movie.

    I should have wrote this review about a month ago when i first saw the movie however i kept just putting it off for no reason. So Johnny Depp is the " man " I'm serious and this film shows his acting skills through dialogue , feelings , emotions and movements. I know its not like his other more popular movies like Pirates of the Caribbean , Edward Scissorhands and others but this one has a special place. This movie is all about loving each other and taking care of another person like Benny was trying to do for joon - I was trying to figure were his mind was at for majority of the film and I'm glad of the outcome because you could tell what his feelings toward Sam were overtime of the film. Joon was very interesting herself - mentally ill yet so artistic seems only right her and a guy like BuStEr kEaToN ( Sam ) would have a connection. I also really liked the scene of them trusting each other and feeling comfortable enough to make real love with one another . In my opinion it was great not seeing private parts it was not needed for the movie , If they would have shown skin it would have seemed to romantic or to open or to pushy or trying to hard for that scene. Its so obvious that Depp did a great job as this quirky / silly / warm hearted / caring / unique character. Benny & Joon's actors also give a good performance I'm not sure how well Aiden and MsM ( Mary s masterson ) would / have done in other movies but in this one they do well and even better when in scenes with Depp. Also I loved the song " 500 miles" they used in the beginning and ending which matched perfectly and had the song in my head all night ! This movie has an amazing three characters and actors -1= some what plays the straight man Benny who changes - 2 = mentally ill yet creative Joon and 3 = wonderful and different one of a kind Sam a guy like buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin ,soundtrack great and overall a happy movie with tons of laughs till the last scene. My family ( even my mom who dislikes a lot of movies loved this one) - especially the ending of this quirky / cute / comedy movie. I recommend this movie go watch it !!

    "Benny & Joon" remains distinctive 20 years later for its handling of mental illness, choosing boldly not to preoccupy itself with a clinical approach and instead to focus on its impact on relationships. But really, it's Johnny Depp who makes it a memorable film. The least interesting of the three main characters is the protagonist in this film, Aidan Quinn's Benny. Benny is the blue collar older brother of the mentally unstable Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), an artist prone to fits including throwing things and pyromania. Both are adults, but Joon obviously needs to be cared for as if a child. After her most recent caretaker quites, Benny finds himself forced to think about sending Joon to a living community, but plans are stalled when an unusual young man ends up in their lives. Sam (Depp) is an eccentric, a young man who models his behavior off silent film star Buster Keaton and performs various physical comedy gags both on purpose yet also intuitively. He charms Joon and after awhile even manages to impress Benny, but he slowly starts to complicate the dynamic between brother and sister. Depp's performance exhibits Keaton but also Gene Wilder ala "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." He's a joy to watch and an absolute natural when it comes to quirkiness. Although audiences had a taste of his talent in "Edward Scissorhands," it's this film where he shows just how excellent of a physical actor he is, foretelling of his eventual mainstream success. Interesting that Depp gets top billing in the credits when it's a film mostly centered on how Benny will deal with Joon. Perhaps "Christmas Vacation" director Jeremiah S. Chechik didn't realize until into filming how great of a performance he was going to get. Regardless, the script from Berry Berman and Lesley McNeil certainly didn't account for it. We spend too much time watching Benny mishandle Joon as well as his personal life despite his good heart and best intentions. A side plot he has with Julianne Moore as the waitress Ruthie completely detracts from the characters that should be getting more screen time, and it's frustrating because their conflict is handled with such immaturity on the part of both characters. With Joon's disorder not diagnosed for the audience, Masterson has little to draw upon for her performance, but she endears us to Joon with a wide-eyed approach whenever she's not throwing a tantrum. Her preoccupation with a man who also has his quirks but wears them so proudly makes a lot of sense, but we don't get to see their relationship blossom with so much of the film spent following Benny around. It's unclear whether writer Berman intended to have the other characters who aren't Joon make poor decisions about their lives in order to make a point. On one hand, such a notion would be wise and true to a certain degree, but on the other, the decisions are so rash that one has to question the authenticity of the characters. "Benny & Joon" mostly sees all its conflict underdeveloped, but the story generates enough curiosity to last the length of the film (though it could really be shorter). Depp's convincing and unusual turn brings a certain life, energy and most importantly memorability to the film, a comedy angle that the film sorely needs. Its approach to conflict is not serious enough to consider it a drama, but it's not nearly romantic enough to be considered a romance. Understandably, it's remembered as a comedy. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more

    I wasn't expecting too much from this but it turned out to be a lot more heart warming and touching of a movie then I would've thought. The story is about a girl with a mental illness, her protective brother and a slightly child like man-child who is talented in a Buster Keaton kind of way. This is a role unlike anything else you've seen Johnny Depp in. Mary Stuart Masterson has a very well layered role and Aidan Quinn plays her protective older brother. Julianne Moore in one of her first roles plays a waitress at the local diner who's a failed actress who's come home from an attempt in Los Angeles that didn't go as well as she had hoped.

    Benny & Joon is a romantic comedy film about how two eccentric individuals, Sam and Juniper,also known as "Joon",who find each other and fall in love.It stars Johnny Depp,Mary Stuart Masterson,Aidan Quinn together with William H. Macy,Julianne Moore and Oliver Platt.It was written by Barry Berman and Lesley McNeil; and it was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. Benny runs a small car repair shop. He must also take care of his mentally ill sister Juniper, better known as Joon. After losing a bet, Benny is forced to bring another eccentric into his house.His name is Sam, the cousin of a friend. Not inclined to conversation, Sam expresses himself by performing Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines.Not surprisingly, he immediately hits it off with Joon. As Sam and Joon fall deeper in love, Benny for the first time in life experiences the pangs of jealousy. Good acting,funny plot and great characters.Although there are some problems in the script and directing,the performances of the cast overshadowed them particularly Johnny Depp,who did extremely well as a physical comedian.His portrayal of Sam is delicately touching, a maladjusted waif with both soul and grit.Watch this for his performance alone.Added to that,Mary Stuart Masterson resists the temptation to soften Joon. That in itself made this movie compelling and worth watching.

    The part for Johnny Depp was tailor-made. As a Buster Keaton look-alike and showing amazing talents, Depp would go on to a career with strong performances as way-out characters. This film is no exception. A very challenged mentally ill woman finds love with the Depp character. Her protective brother can't see it until he realizes that he also has a life to live-in this case with Julianne Moore. The film proves that mentally challenged people can find happiness under certain circumstances. If possible, they must be given the freedom to pursue this. Moore is excellent in the role as the mentally challenged woman. Her total breakdown on the bus was a scene of rare quality. As the brother, Aidan Quinn is totally sympathetic in the part. There are certainly comical breaks in this challenging film.

    I would say this film was pretty much a clich&eacute;. Two strange people fall in love in this mainstream society. But there were some interesting aspects: for example, there was not too many mushy-mushy moments of verbally expressing love (I really can't stand that in films!); also, the actors were believable and did not over do it. But overall, the film didn't give any insight on new ideas and just focused on a standard topic of "forbidden love", and was pretty much predictable all the way till the end just like all Hollywood films. As a Johnny Depp fan, I don't regret watching it, but it is not a movie I would recommend to anyone.

    Today "Benny and Joon", a 1993 romantic comedy, is mostly remembered for an oddball performance by actor Johnny Depp, who plays a young man with a fondness for impersonating silent Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines. Depp can't touch Chaplin or Keaton, but his character is at times heartwarming. Depp fangals adore the film, particularly the way Depp risks life and limb for his woman, sticking by her side no matter what. The ladies love it. The film features an early performance by the always interesting Julianne Moore. Like Depp's character, hers is a meta-roll, Moore a good actress playing a bad actress who gave up bad acting to be a good waiter. Most of the film is filler, but Moore and Depp elevate things. Depp would make a career out of playing oddball characters. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.
