    After directing his blood and gore splatter epics: Bad Taste, Meet The Feebles, and Braindead; Peter Jackson directed his very first mainstream film, long before his own adaption trilogy of The Lord of The Rings. "Heavenly Creatures" tells the story about Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juilet (Played by "Titanic" fame, Kate Winslet.), and how their homosexual relationship ends tragically after a murder escapade. It's all based on a true New Zealand story, which seems very odd, as a selection of scenes from the film are fantasy. There are many good reasons why this film is worth watching. The visuals are amazing, the emotion is strong and powerful, and the innocence and beauty of the main characters defines the film's title. I quite enjoyed Heavenly Creatures, and I can recommend it for those who like Peter Jackson's other films. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    Heavenly Creatures is one of the most fascinating films I've seen in a long time. The story is unique, to say the least. It's the true story of two girls, Pauline Parker(Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme(Kate Winslet) who have an unusual, obsessive relationship to the point where they're rumored to be lesbian and get broken up by their parents, enraged they decide to get back at them. What's interesting to me about this movie is how ambiguous it is. There's very little that actually gets explained directly to the audience. Sure, the logical reason they killed Parker's mother is because they didn't want to be broken up but their psychological reasonings are never really explained. In fact, this is one of the hardest reviews for me to write because it's so unique and open to interpretation but I'll try my best. I think the question this movie is trying to raise is should you listen to what society says or should you be who you really are. We don't see every bit of their lives but I assume that these girls prior meeting each other were social outcasts and loners and in a way, these girls were made for each other. They bond with each other extremely well because they're both highly imaginative, curious girls who have never been allowed to show who they really were because of the rules society had back then for how girls should behave. So when they hang out together, it's like they are freeing themselves of society's rules and entering their own world of storytelling, Mario Lanza(a tenor they idolize), and imagination. But their bond may have been too strong for each other because there was very few girls like them so they end up obsessing over one another to the point where the parents feel this relationship is unhealthy and decide to split them. But the film never really tells us whether or not, these parents are doing the right thing. It's all up to the viewer. Later on, the girls start planning out their murder and when it happens, it's one of the most disturbing murders ever filmed in my opinion. It isn't disturbing just because of how violent it is but more so because of how personal this murder is. They didn't do it to some stranger for money, they did it to someone they knew for a long time out of anger and frustration! And there's a moment where you see how Parker really regrets going with this decision, when she first strikes her mother with the brick, she starts tearing up. I read somewhere she didn't shed a tear in real life but that was a brilliant decision on Jackson's part as director and it adds a lot of nuance to her character. I think Jackson's directing feels a little too artsy in some scenes. He made this after making low-budget horror-comedy films like Bad Taste and Braindead and I think with this film, he was really trying to establish himself as a serious dramatic director but some scenes do feel unnecessarily artsy. But the thing the movie gets perfect is the two girls. Not only are they acted excellently, but they have a lot of dimension. It could have been easy for Jackson just to make them misunderstood, innocent people and while they seem to be like that in the first half, they also are portrayed as extremely sensitive and perhaps maybe a little mad. But once again, the film doesn't tell us how to feel about them, it lets us decide on our own. Another thing I appreciate is the camera-work. Sam Raimi's been listed on Wikipedia as one of his influences in filmmaking and it shows here because of the way he shoots his scenes and it looks excellent. Sadly though, his later films had abandoned this style of camera-work. Overall, while Jackson's direction can seem a little too artsy at times, the film is wonderfully-acted, well-shot, and beautifully ambiguous so I'm gonna give it a 8/10.

    the story was so basic yet so utter, so real yet so celestial, inhuman yet so human. the surface of my skin, all over body, roused and shuddered in solidarity as the play reached its final.../ it was the stretched reaction of the skin, towards the transcending sprite trying to "liberate" and "violate" the imposed limits of my self-space. I was left with two hands locked in each other, streams of tears in the eyes, echoing screams of the two in the ear... and plainly pinned to the black screen as the final credits were rolling. review on this film should not be polluted with words of speculation or expression, and I don't intend to go further. I have just one stand to present : This Film Should Merely "Be Seen".... Merely "Be Seen".... PS: I write these lines right after watching the movie, because as deductive, destructive polluting brain that i possess, i know i'm gonna compartmentalize the whole experience, movie, characters, and every element of it, during next few days...But for now...just for tonight,and since a long time... i'm gonna allow myself to turn off the top floor of my anatomy, and feel it with all cells of my flesh, as long as i can, as slowly as i can, this artistic drama that without notice, has been slipped into the mouth.. Do yourself a favor and don't ask or seek, just see!

    Heavenly Creatures is probably the most mature film Peter Jackson has ever made. It perfectly shows what his capable as director, storyteller and what he is missing nowadays - good editor. Peter Jackson has something that many directors lack nowadays - experience at making low-budget schlock. Making B-movies is the best way to learn your craft as a filmmaker and most importantly working with limited budgets, actors, visual effects and editing. And the end result is quite wonderful - we have a director who can tackle strange stories, makes a great use of visuals and is not afraid of getting gritty and brutal. Heavenly Creatures looks and feels like a Peter Jackson film. There are his signature camera movement, strange and over the top performances and his signature bizarre visuals. It never feels like a realistic because of the way it's shot and acted since the story is very demented, dark and tragic in it's nature. The performances are all over the place and quite goofy most of the time. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey provide the central performances of the film and they are absolutely great in a demented sort of way. The only problem is the fact that look slightly older than they are supposed to be which can be distracting at times. The supporting cast is as over the top and loony as you can get but it perfectly fits the vision of the film. The only real problem I had with Heavenly Creatures was the ending. It felt rushed and somewhat poorly done. Most of these film that are based on true events, end fairly abruptly and feature a lame text crawl. It's a clich&eacute; that needs to stop because feature films need a rock solid conclusion not some abrupt ending. A Man Who was Superman had wonderful ending despite the fact it was based on true story... Despite it's lame ending, Heavenly Creatures is a wonderful film that showcases the strangest mainstream director of our time moving from gory B-movies to serious art-house cinema. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan, Kate Winslet fan or just a fan of interesting films, Heavenly Creatures is a must see.

    New Zealand screenwriter, producer and director Peter Jackson's fourth feature film which he co-wrote with New Zealand screenwriter, producer and lyricist Frances Walsh and co-produced, is inspired by the Parker-Hulme murder case from 1954 which took place in Christchurch on the South Island of New Zealand where the film was shot. It premiered In competition at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994 and is a New Zealand production which was produced by New Zealand producer Jim Booth (1945-1994). It tells the story about two 15-year-old students named Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme who meets at a girls' secondary school in Christchurch during a summer in the early 1950s. Pauline and Juliet becomes best friends and creates their own secluded imaginary world, but when their parents begins worrying about their behavior and the nature of their relationship, they try to separate them. Distinctly and finely directed by New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson, this rhythmic, biographical and fictional story which is narrated by and from the two female protagonists viewpoints, draws a distinct portrayal of a malicious and unruly friendship between two aspiring writers. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by New Zealand production designer Grant Major, cinematography by New Zealand cinematographer Alun Bollinger and fine costume design by New Zealand costume designer Ngila Dickson and use of sound, this character-driven, narrative-driven and fairy-tale-like psychological thriller depicts two interrelated and in-depth studies of character and contains a great score by New Zealand composer Peter Dasent. This darkly humorous, significantly atmospheric and remarkable coming-of-age indie from the early 1990s which is set during a summer in 1954 in a city in New Zealand, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, eccentric characters, fine editing by New Zealand film editor Jamie Selkirk and the prominent and brilliant acting performances by New Zealand actress Melanie Lynskey, English actress Kate Winslet and the fine supporting acting performance by New Zealand actress Sarah Pierse. A surreal, sensual, inventive and wickedly romantic crime drama which gained, among numerous other awards, the Silver Lion Peter Jackson at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994.

    I came into the movie at the halfway mark and watched the rest from there, something entirely out of character for me but I knew Peter Jackson had directed this and I wanted to see what it was about. (I didn't know anything about the back story or that it was real.) I haven't seen everything he's done but it looked like he was diving into a completely different kind of subject matter than some of his movies, so I gave it a shot. In all honesty, I hate movies like this. Head trippy, psychological thrillers do nothing for me. In fact, I was going in a completely different direction for a while. I kept laughing, inappropriately as it turns out. The main girl's expression was so ridiculous and funny, and that hair...lumbering around like Bigfoot...she looked like a female version of Peter lol. But I was soon to find out all these tidbits of levity were not important to the story. Predictably, it turns into a love story because that's what a lot of teenagers do, they experiment and fall in love at the drop of a hat. So now that we're supposed to believe that they're in love, of which I never do (it doesn't come across as anything other than horny teenagers having sex), their desperation combined with their insanity turns deadly. Now I've gone from laughing at some silly scenes to somehow believing these girls are capable of bludgeoning someone to death and not just someone, her own mother. I'm sorry, but nothing in this movie convinced me of the events that could lead up to this. It almost seems like the filmmakers were glorifying this event rather than chronicling it. I just don't see real hate. I don't see real love. I don't see real anguish, except by Kate Winslet who seems to be upset by the littlest of things. Perhaps watching the entire movie would shed more light but having seen what I've seen I don't think it would change my opinion of it. Frankly, I'm glad I didn't pay any money for this. I'm not saying it's wholly bad, if you like psychological thrillers, go for it. Psych. thrillers in general don't make any sense but you're supposed to allow yourself to go along with the ride, no matter how silly or unbelievable it gets, so if that's what you like, you should be good here. I applaud Peter for attempting such a subject matter, especially since it's a true story. But I really don't think we need any more first-person accounts of real-life murders anymore. There wasn't anything beautiful about this story. That would be like saying the Lizzie Borden murders were beautiful. No, this is just sad and should have been portrayed in an appropriate way, if nothing else, for the families. Plus, it would have been great for those of us who weren't rooting for them to see those witches for what they really are and not try to get us to feel sorry for them.

    It was hard to believe that horror specialist Jackson, who's Braindead is one of the goriest movies ever delivered, could make a movie that is so lovely, sweet en gorgeous as Heavenly Creatures. Now he is one of the greatest directors who's working now because of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the remake of King Kong and The Hobbit. For me this was the beginning of a great director's life. Two girls, the uncertain Lynskey and the 'wild' Winslet, live in the 50s in the conservative New Zealand and have a close friendship. To close, or so their parents say. They fear that their daughters are lesbians. The two lose themselves completely in their together fantasized medieval fantasy world. When they threaten to be torn away from each other, Lynskey gets the plan to murder her mother, with disastrous consequences. The two young, debuting actresses deliver great performances, and are helped by a strong adult cast. In Venice awarded a Golden Lion and the screenplay by Jackson and Frances Walsh was nominated for an Oscar. Three years later, Winslet would become world famous by her role in the blockbuster Titanic. Great drama, great effects, great acting and great but sad story.

    Pauline Parker is a misguided adolescent. She is blinded by the belief that her best buddy Juliet Hulme's family is the ideal one where she belongs. Her foolish ignorance of the love, care and affection given by her own middle-class parents can be especially found when she does not consider the fact that it is her mother who always takes notice of her feeling and tries talking to her, like when Pauline is sad about Juliet contacting tuberculosis or when she is sitting in one corner away from the rest of her family. Pauline's vivid imagination also innocently made Dr. Henry Hulme (Juliet's dad) a hero, when in reality he was a major cause for the separation of the two girls. She may have a wider knowledge and a greater imagination than her mother, but she also was bafflingly stupid and ungrateful for believing her mother was the main enemy in the film. The unfortunate incident of the mother's murder would not have happened at all had Juliet not entered Pauline's life and poisoned it with deluded thoughts about the Fourth World. If Pauline is misguided, Juliet is the main cause for leading her buddy astray. I really don't know how to take the fact that this same Juliet is a best-selling author now, because the movie unflatteringly portrays her as a cankerous albeit intelligent mind who thinks 'scars are romantic'. Pauline meanwhile leads a reclusive life at a school, ashamed of her dark and twisted past and seeking redemption possibly by nurturing school children to be unlike what she had been. The sensational murder case of Honora Parker by her own daughter Pauline and her best friend (and lover probably) Juliet Hulme is brought to screen in a fascinating and unorthodox fashion by auteur director- scriptwriter Peter Jackson. Though not as talked about as cases like Black Dahlia or the Moors Murders, the 1954 murder case is still a very intriguing one for the plain reason that it was hard to fathom that two very intelligent girls could turn into cold-blooded murderers of one's own mother. Also to be considered is the relationship between the two girls who are seemingly lesbians yet it cannot be entirely confirmed as they do not show much attraction towards other girls. The diaries written by Pauline refer to the girls' communion with 'saints' in the Fourth world who are mostly made of actors like Orson Welles, and thus act as a major source material for the film and another reason for raising curiosity about the case. Peter Jackson is not one to keep it straight; much like David Lynch he has his directorial mark etched all over the film. Heavenly Angels does not start with court proceedings, and neither does it show the arrest of the two girls. It lets us enter and experience the 'mental music' of the girls themselves rather than presenting its events informally through banal court sessions. Jackson's transition from Braindead to Heavenly Children and following transition to Lord of the Rings is clearly visible in Heavenly Children, which seems to possess both the stylistic characteristics of the preceding and succeeding films. Not only do the characters give slightly mannered performances that recalls the over- the-top acting in Braindead (such as a scene in the first quarter where Pauline's father holds a fish in his hands and pretends to sing while the record of Mario Lanza plays on), but certain characters also give us impressions of characters from Braindead (especially the timid boarders at Pauline's home who are quite similar to Braindead's male protagonist). On the other hand, Juliet dressed as a princess chasing Pauline, with white horses in the background may recall magical sequences from LOTR series; I may be wrong in saying this since I have not seen the Lord of the Ring series. There are a number of brilliantly choreographed sequences, especially the montage showing Pauline's and Juliet's happy days together, lightened with Mario Lanza's arresting music. Some involve lighthearted humor that nevertheless act as a presage for the girls' worsening behavior, such as the hilarious scene at the hospital where Juliet is approached by a middle-aged man who rambles about Christ and placing faith in Christianity and is ultimately beheaded albeit in Juliet's mind by one of the saints. The most unnerving part is reserved for the end where the characters the camera movements slow down and silence becomes more pronounced, with only a background score playing solemnly as we brace ourselves to watch that dreadful part. Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in each and every scene; apart from one scene involving the girls discussing about each others' scars where she sounds too crazy, she successfully makes Juliet a highly mentally fragile female whose attachment to her fantasy life and Fourth World acts as a catalyst for the disruption of the lives of the two families. She also excellently plays the brutal murder scene, rightly giving the 'should-we-really-do-this' look to Juliet. But Melanie is the true star here, doing a great job performing the difficult role of Pauline. Not only do her expressions, her lack of eye contact and her defensive sitting posture accurately portray the role she is playing of a socially awkward teenager, but Lyndskey also gives her character Pauline a unique manner of smiling where her nose crinkles up as she smiles. And both actresses play their characters with damn seriousness even during the hallucination sequences, which is a tough job for such a young pair of ladies. Also, Sarah Peirse is terrific in her slightly straightforward role as the mother who is the only one taking an effort to understand what's wrong with her daughter. I unfortunately do not have the unrated version of the movie which is slightly longer but would have nevertheless remained useful because I've read it contains scenes involving Juliet's mother's affair with one of the patients. 'Heavenly' Recommended.

    We all know Peter Jackson as the man who directed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: but his early days as a director of horror-comedies. His 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures, based on a real-life murder, was his first step away from that genre and show what else he was capable of. In 1952 Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) is a social outsider who does not get on well with her peers at her school in Christchuch, New Zealand. But at the start of the new term she befriends a new student, English girl Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet). Both had childhood illnesses and they bond through their imagination, their creation of a fantasy world and have a love of music, particularly Mario Lanza. But their friendship slowly turns to obsession with each other, becoming extremely close, they find it hard to separate fantasy from reality and their fantasies become more and more violent. Mixed with their personal troubles their parents try to separate them, resulting with them planning a murder. Heavenly Creatures is a wonderfully made film and it was very Kubrickian in its approach. The lighting and use of shadows, colours and camera movement made the film look very much like Stanley Kubrick film and this was the type of story that would interested the man. The use of narrator also felt very similar to how Kubrick would let us know the thoughts of our main character. This film does have a great feeling of being like A Clockwork Orange, Lolita and The Shining, even though they are different films. We got the suburban setting of Lolita, the out of control youths from A Clockwork Orange and the theme of insanity and fantasy from The Shinning. On the wider front of Jackson's direction it was faultless. The pacing was perfect (I watched the 95 minute cut), the special effects were great for the time (this was Weta's first film) and it blended well with the film. Despite the low budget the special effects worked well and shifted between light and upbeat to dark and creepy. There are excellent camera moments and editing trick to shift us from the world of reality to fantasy and it was fitting for the situation as the girls were loosing their minds or using their imagination to enact violence fantasies. There are a lot of themes and ideas being explored in Heavenly Creatures. The most obvious are obsession, insanity and mental health, the parent-child relationship and friendship, even if the result is detrimental. But there are other themes about adolescence, about how it was changing and there was little understand of this period. We see how adolescence is a period of transition, from the two girls having fantasies which turn darker and they start to embark on more adult ventures, even at their young age, but also making them vulnerable to being exploited. There is a lack of understanding and this was film was set in a period where we are children or adults and no in-between. There is a clique of attitudes and psychology of the period as well a look at differing of parenting approaches. Heavenly Creatures was the first film for Winslet and Lynskey and there were of course there excellent in their roles, playing two hardly complex, troubled girls. Both are very bright and imaginative and you can easily believe in their friendship and relationship and how unusually close they are. The adult actors too were very strong throughout and there were no weak links in a film about two teenage girls taking a very dark turn. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan then you need see Heavenly Creatures. Other wises Heavenly Creatures is worthy film both as a piece of dramatic storytelling, visual filmmaking and a thematic piece about obsessions and unhealthy relationships.

    Pauline(Melanie) is a loner at school. She becomes friends with Juliet(Kate Winslet in her debut role) who is the new girl in class. They spend a lot of time together. Winslet is writing a fantasy book and both begin to live the book. Their parents are not pleased with their proximity and decide to separate them. The girls have their own plan to get back at their parents. Superbly directed by Peter Jackson, this is based on events which occurred in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand in 1953 and 54. The acting by both the leads is excellent. The fantasy scenes are created brilliantly and the characters of the two sets of parents are given quality screen time. This is a must watch for the fans of true crime and good drama and acting. 3.5 out of 5.

    Heavenly Creatures is one of the most fascinating films I've seen in a long time. The story is unique, to say the least. It's the true story of two girls, Pauline Parker(Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme(Kate Winslet) who have an unusual, obsessive relationship to the point where they're rumored to be lesbian and get broken up by their parents, enraged they decide to get back at them.

He made this after making low-budget horror-comedy films like Bad Taste and Braindead and I think with this film, he was really trying to establish himself as a serious dramatic director but some scenes do feel unnecessarily artsy. But the thing the movie gets perfect is the two girls. Not only are they acted excellently, but they have a lot of dimension. It could have been easy for Jackson just to make them misunderstood, innocent people and while they seem to be like that in the first half, they also are portrayed as extremely sensitive and perhaps maybe a little mad. But once again, the film doesn't tell us how to feel about them, it lets us decide on our own. Another thing I appreciate is the camera-work. Sam Raimi's been listed on Wikipedia as one of his influences in filmmaking and it shows here because of the way he shoots his scenes and it looks excellent. Sadly though, his later films had abandoned this style of camera-work. Overall, while Jackson's direction can seem a little too artsy at times, the film is wonderfully-acted, well-shot, and beautifully ambiguous so I'm gonna give it a 8/10.

    the story was so basic yet so utter, so real yet so celestial, inhuman yet so human. the surface of my skin, all over body, roused and shuddered in solidarity as the play reached its final.../ it was the stretched reaction of the skin, towards the transcending sprite trying to "liberate" and "violate" the imposed limits of my self-space. I was left with two hands locked in each other, streams of tears in the eyes, echoing screams of the two in the ear... and plainly pinned to the black screen as the final credits were rolling. review on this film should not be polluted with words of speculation or expression, and I don't intend to go further. I have just one stand to present : This Film Should Merely "Be Seen".... Merely "Be Seen".... PS: I write these lines right after watching the movie, because as deductive, destructive polluting brain that i possess, i know i'm gonna compartmentalize the whole experience, movie, characters, and every element of it, during next few days...But for now...just for tonight,and since a long time... i'm gonna allow myself to turn off the top floor of my anatomy, and feel it with all cells of my flesh, as long as i can, as slowly as i can, this artistic drama that without notice, has been slipped into the mouth.. Do yourself a favor and don't ask or seek, just see!

    Heavenly Creatures is probably the most mature film Peter Jackson has ever made. It perfectly shows what his capable as director, storyteller and what he is missing nowadays - good editor. Peter Jackson has something that many directors lack nowadays - experience at making low-budget schlock. Making B-movies is the best way to learn your craft as a filmmaker and most importantly working with limited budgets, actors, visual effects and editing. And the end result is quite wonderful - we have a director who can tackle strange stories, makes a great use of visuals and is not afraid of getting gritty and brutal. Heavenly Creatures looks and feels like a Peter Jackson film. There are his signature camera movement, strange and over the top performances and his signature bizarre visuals. It never feels like a realistic because of the way it's shot and acted since the story is very demented, dark and tragic in it's nature. The performances are all over the place and quite goofy most of the time. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey provide the central performances of the film and they are absolutely great in a demented sort of way. The only problem is the fact that look slightly older than they are supposed to be which can be distracting at times. The supporting cast is as over the top and loony as you can get but it perfectly fits the vision of the film. The only real problem I had with Heavenly Creatures was the ending. It felt rushed and somewhat poorly done. Most of these film that are based on true events, end fairly abruptly and feature a lame text crawl. It's a clich&eacute; that needs to stop because feature films need a rock solid conclusion not some abrupt ending. A Man Who was Superman had wonderful ending despite the fact it was based on true story... Despite it's lame ending, Heavenly Creatures is a wonderful film that showcases the strangest mainstream director of our time moving from gory B-movies to serious art-house cinema. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan, Kate Winslet fan or just a fan of interesting films, Heavenly Creatures is a must see.

    New Zealand screenwriter, producer and director Peter Jackson's fourth feature film which he co-wrote with New Zealand screenwriter, producer and lyricist Frances Walsh and co-produced, is inspired by the Parker-Hulme murder case from 1954 which took place in Christchurch on the South Island of New Zealand where the film was shot. It premiered In competition at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994 and is a New Zealand production which was produced by New Zealand producer Jim Booth (1945-1994). It tells the story about two 15-year-old students named Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme who meets at a girls' secondary school in Christchurch during a summer in the early 1950s. Pauline and Juliet becomes best friends and creates their own secluded imaginary world, but when their parents begins worrying about their behavior and the nature of their relationship, they try to separate them. Distinctly and finely directed by New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson, this rhythmic, biographical and fictional story which is narrated by and from the two female protagonists viewpoints, draws a distinct portrayal of a malicious and unruly friendship between two aspiring writers. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by New Zealand production designer Grant Major, cinematography by New Zealand cinematographer Alun Bollinger and fine costume design by New Zealand costume designer Ngila Dickson and use of sound, this character-driven, narrative-driven and fairy-tale-like psychological thriller depicts two interrelated and in-depth studies of character and contains a great score by New Zealand composer Peter Dasent. This darkly humorous, significantly atmospheric and remarkable coming-of-age indie from the early 1990s which is set during a summer in 1954 in a city in New Zealand, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, eccentric characters, fine editing by New Zealand film editor Jamie Selkirk and the prominent and brilliant acting performances by New Zealand actress Melanie Lynskey, English actress Kate Winslet and the fine supporting acting performance by New Zealand actress Sarah Pierse. A surreal, sensual, inventive and wickedly romantic crime drama which gained, among numerous other awards, the Silver Lion Peter Jackson at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994.

    I came into the movie at the halfway mark and watched the rest from there, something entirely out of character for me but I knew Peter Jackson had directed this and I wanted to see what it was about. (I didn't know anything about the back story or that it was real.) I haven't seen everything he's done but it looked like he was diving into a completely different kind of subject matter than some of his movies, so I gave it a shot. In all honesty, I hate movies like this. Head trippy, psychological thrillers do nothing for me. In fact, I was going in a completely different direction for a while. I kept laughing, inappropriately as it turns out. The main girl's expression was so ridiculous and funny, and that hair...lumbering around like Bigfoot...she looked like a female version of Peter lol. But I was soon to find out all these tidbits of levity were not important to the story. Predictably, it turns into a love story because that's what a lot of teenagers do, they experiment and fall in love at the drop of a hat. So now that we're supposed to believe that they're in love, of which I never do (it doesn't come across as anything other than horny teenagers having sex), their desperation combined with their insanity turns deadly. Now I've gone from laughing at some silly scenes to somehow believing these girls are capable of bludgeoning someone to death and not just someone, her own mother. I'm sorry, but nothing in this movie convinced me of the events that could lead up to this. It almost seems like the filmmakers were glorifying this event rather than chronicling it. I just don't see real hate. I don't see real love. I don't see real anguish, except by Kate Winslet who seems to be upset by the littlest of things. Perhaps watching the entire movie would shed more light but having seen what I've seen I don't think it would change my opinion of it. Frankly, I'm glad I didn't pay any money for this. I'm not saying it's wholly bad, if you like psychological thrillers, go for it. Psych. thrillers in general don't make any sense but you're supposed to allow yourself to go along with the ride, no matter how silly or unbelievable it gets, so if that's what you like, you should be good here. I applaud Peter for attempting such a subject matter, especially since it's a true story. But I really don't think we need any more first-person accounts of real-life murders anymore. There wasn't anything beautiful about this story. That would be like saying the Lizzie Borden murders were beautiful. No, this is just sad and should have been portrayed in an appropriate way, if nothing else, for the families. Plus, it would have been great for those of us who weren't rooting for them to see those witches for what they really are and not try to get us to feel sorry for them.

    It was hard to believe that horror specialist Jackson, who's Braindead is one of the goriest movies ever delivered, could make a movie that is so lovely, sweet en gorgeous as Heavenly Creatures. Now he is one of the greatest directors who's working now because of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the remake of King Kong and The Hobbit. For me this was the beginning of a great director's life. Two girls, the uncertain Lynskey and the 'wild' Winslet, live in the 50s in the conservative New Zealand and have a close friendship. To close, or so their parents say. They fear that their daughters are lesbians. The two lose themselves completely in their together fantasized medieval fantasy world. When they threaten to be torn away from each other, Lynskey gets the plan to murder her mother, with disastrous consequences. The two young, debuting actresses deliver great performances, and are helped by a strong adult cast. In Venice awarded a Golden Lion and the screenplay by Jackson and Frances Walsh was nominated for an Oscar. Three years later, Winslet would become world famous by her role in the blockbuster Titanic. Great drama, great effects, great acting and great but sad story.

    Pauline Parker is a misguided adolescent. She is blinded by the belief that her best buddy Juliet Hulme's family is the ideal one where she belongs. Her foolish ignorance of the love, care and affection given by her own middle-class parents can be especially found when she does not consider the fact that it is her mother who always takes notice of her feeling and tries talking to her, like when Pauline is sad about Juliet contacting tuberculosis or when she is sitting in one corner away from the rest of her family. Pauline's vivid imagination also innocently made Dr. Henry Hulme (Juliet's dad) a hero, when in reality he was a major cause for the separation of the two girls. She may have a wider knowledge and a greater imagination than her mother, but she also was bafflingly stupid and ungrateful for believing her mother was the main enemy in the film. The unfortunate incident of the mother's murder would not have happened at all had Juliet not entered Pauline's life and poisoned it with deluded thoughts about the Fourth World. If Pauline is misguided, Juliet is the main cause for leading her buddy astray. I really don't know how to take the fact that this same Juliet is a best-selling author now, because the movie unflatteringly portrays her as a cankerous albeit intelligent mind who thinks 'scars are romantic'. Pauline meanwhile leads a reclusive life at a school, ashamed of her dark and twisted past and seeking redemption possibly by nurturing school children to be unlike what she had been. The sensational murder case of Honora Parker by her own daughter Pauline and her best friend (and lover probably) Juliet Hulme is brought to screen in a fascinating and unorthodox fashion by auteur director- scriptwriter Peter Jackson. Though not as talked about as cases like Black Dahlia or the Moors Murders, the 1954 murder case is still a very intriguing one for the plain reason that it was hard to fathom that two very intelligent girls could turn into cold-blooded murderers of one's own mother. Also to be considered is the relationship between the two girls who are seemingly lesbians yet it cannot be entirely confirmed as they do not show much attraction towards other girls. The diaries written by Pauline refer to the girls' communion with 'saints' in the Fourth world who are mostly made of actors like Orson Welles, and thus act as a major source material for the film and another reason for raising curiosity about the case. Peter Jackson is not one to keep it straight; much like David Lynch he has his directorial mark etched all over the film. Heavenly Angels does not start with court proceedings, and neither does it show the arrest of the two girls. It lets us enter and experience the 'mental music' of the girls themselves rather than presenting its events informally through banal court sessions. Jackson's transition from Braindead to Heavenly Children and following transition to Lord of the Rings is clearly visible in Heavenly Children, which seems to possess both the stylistic characteristics of the preceding and succeeding films. Not only do the characters give slightly mannered performances that recalls the over- the-top acting in Braindead (such as a scene in the first quarter where Pauline's father holds a fish in his hands and pretends to sing while the record of Mario Lanza plays on), but certain characters also give us impressions of characters from Braindead (especially the timid boarders at Pauline's home who are quite similar to Braindead's male protagonist). On the other hand, Juliet dressed as a princess chasing Pauline, with white horses in the background may recall magical sequences from LOTR series; I may be wrong in saying this since I have not seen the Lord of the Ring series. There are a number of brilliantly choreographed sequences, especially the montage showing Pauline's and Juliet's happy days together, lightened with Mario Lanza's arresting music. Some involve lighthearted humor that nevertheless act as a presage for the girls' worsening behavior, such as the hilarious scene at the hospital where Juliet is approached by a middle-aged man who rambles about Christ and placing faith in Christianity and is ultimately beheaded albeit in Juliet's mind by one of the saints. The most unnerving part is reserved for the end where the characters the camera movements slow down and silence becomes more pronounced, with only a background score playing solemnly as we brace ourselves to watch that dreadful part. Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in each and every scene; apart from one scene involving the girls discussing about each others' scars where she sounds too crazy, she successfully makes Juliet a highly mentally fragile female whose attachment to her fantasy life and Fourth World acts as a catalyst for the disruption of the lives of the two families. She also excellently plays the brutal murder scene, rightly giving the 'should-we-really-do-this' look to Juliet. But Melanie is the true star here, doing a great job performing the difficult role of Pauline. Not only do her expressions, her lack of eye contact and her defensive sitting posture accurately portray the role she is playing of a socially awkward teenager, but Lyndskey also gives her character Pauline a unique manner of smiling where her nose crinkles up as she smiles. And both actresses play their characters with damn seriousness even during the hallucination sequences, which is a tough job for such a young pair of ladies. Also, Sarah Peirse is terrific in her slightly straightforward role as the mother who is the only one taking an effort to understand what's wrong with her daughter. I unfortunately do not have the unrated version of the movie which is slightly longer but would have nevertheless remained useful because I've read it contains scenes involving Juliet's mother's affair with one of the patients. 'Heavenly' Recommended.

    We all know Peter Jackson as the man who directed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: but his early days as a director of horror-comedies. His 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures, based on a real-life murder, was his first step away from that genre and show what else he was capable of. In 1952 Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) is a social outsider who does not get on well with her peers at her school in Christchuch, New Zealand. But at the start of the new term she befriends a new student, English girl Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet). Both had childhood illnesses and they bond through their imagination, their creation of a fantasy world and have a love of music, particularly Mario Lanza. But their friendship slowly turns to obsession with each other, becoming extremely close, they find it hard to separate fantasy from reality and their fantasies become more and more violent. Mixed with their personal troubles their parents try to separate them, resulting with them planning a murder. Heavenly Creatures is a wonderfully made film and it was very Kubrickian in its approach. The lighting and use of shadows, colours and camera movement made the film look very much like Stanley Kubrick film and this was the type of story that would interested the man. The use of narrator also felt very similar to how Kubrick would let us know the thoughts of our main character. This film does have a great feeling of being like A Clockwork Orange, Lolita and The Shining, even though they are different films. We got the suburban setting of Lolita, the out of control youths from A Clockwork Orange and the theme of insanity and fantasy from The Shinning. On the wider front of Jackson's direction it was faultless. The pacing was perfect (I watched the 95 minute cut), the special effects were great for the time (this was Weta's first film) and it blended well with the film. Despite the low budget the special effects worked well and shifted between light and upbeat to dark and creepy. There are excellent camera moments and editing trick to shift us from the world of reality to fantasy and it was fitting for the situation as the girls were loosing their minds or using their imagination to enact violence fantasies. There are a lot of themes and ideas being explored in Heavenly Creatures. The most obvious are obsession, insanity and mental health, the parent-child relationship and friendship, even if the result is detrimental. But there are other themes about adolescence, about how it was changing and there was little understand of this period. We see how adolescence is a period of transition, from the two girls having fantasies which turn darker and they start to embark on more adult ventures, even at their young age, but also making them vulnerable to being exploited. There is a lack of understanding and this was film was set in a period where we are children or adults and no in-between. There is a clique of attitudes and psychology of the period as well a look at differing of parenting approaches. Heavenly Creatures was the first film for Winslet and Lynskey and there were of course there excellent in their roles, playing two hardly complex, troubled girls. Both are very bright and imaginative and you can easily believe in their friendship and relationship and how unusually close they are. The adult actors too were very strong throughout and there were no weak links in a film about two teenage girls taking a very dark turn. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan then you need see Heavenly Creatures. Other wises Heavenly Creatures is worthy film both as a piece of dramatic storytelling, visual filmmaking and a thematic piece about obsessions and unhealthy relationships.

    Pauline(Melanie) is a loner at school. She becomes friends with Juliet(Kate Winslet in her debut role) who is the new girl in class. They spend a lot of time together. Winslet is writing a fantasy book and both begin to live the book. Their parents are not pleased with their proximity and decide to separate them. The girls have their own plan to get back at their parents. Superbly directed by Peter Jackson, this is based on events which occurred in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand in 1953 and 54. The acting by both the leads is excellent. The fantasy scenes are created brilliantly and the characters of the two sets of parents are given quality screen time. This is a must watch for the fans of true crime and good drama and acting. 3.5 out of 5.

    After directing his blood and gore splatter epics: Bad Taste, Meet The Feebles, and Braindead; Peter Jackson directed his very first mainstream film, long before his own adaption trilogy of The Lord of The Rings. "Heavenly Creatures" tells the story about Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juilet (Played by "Titanic" fame, Kate Winslet.), and how their homosexual relationship ends tragically after a murder escapade. It's all based on a true New Zealand story, which seems very odd, as a selection of scenes from the film are fantasy. There are many good reasons why this film is worth watching. The visuals are amazing, the emotion is strong and powerful, and the innocence and beauty of the main characters defines the film's title. I quite enjoyed Heavenly Creatures, and I can recommend it for those who like Peter Jackson's other films. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    Heavenly Creatures is one of the most fascinating films I've seen in a long time. The story is unique, to say the least. It's the true story of two girls, Pauline Parker(Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme(Kate Winslet) who have an unusual, obsessive relationship to the point where they're rumored to be lesbian and get broken up by their parents, enraged they decide to get back at them. What's interesting to me about this movie is how ambiguous it is. There's very little that actually gets explained directly to the audience. Sure, the logical reason they killed Parker's mother is because they didn't want to be broken up but their psychological reasonings are never really explained. In fact, this is one of the hardest reviews for me to write because it's so unique and open to interpretation but I'll try my best. I think the question this movie is trying to raise is should you listen to what society says or should you be who you really are. We don't see every bit of their lives but I assume that these girls prior meeting each other were social outcasts and loners and in a way, these girls were made for each other. They bond with each other extremely well because they're both highly imaginative, curious girls who have never been allowed to show who they really were because of the rules society had back then for how girls should behave. So when they hang out together, it's like they are freeing themselves of society's rules and entering their own world of storytelling, Mario Lanza(a tenor they idolize), and imagination. But their bond may have been too strong for each other because there was very few girls like them so they end up obsessing over one another to the point where the parents feel this relationship is unhealthy and decide to split them. But the film never really tells us whether or not, these parents are doing the right thing. It's all up to the viewer. Later on, the girls start planning out their murder and when it happens, it's one of the most disturbing murders ever filmed in my opinion. It isn't disturbing just because of how violent it is but more so because of how personal this murder is. They didn't do it to some stranger for money, they did it to someone they knew for a long time out of anger and frustration! And there's a moment where you see how Parker really regrets going with this decision, when she first strikes her mother with the brick, she starts tearing up. I read somewhere she didn't shed a tear in real life but that was a brilliant decision on Jackson's part as director and it adds a lot of nuance to her character. I think Jackson's directing feels a little too artsy in some scenes. He made this after making low-budget horror-comedy films like Bad Taste and Braindead and I think with this film, he was really trying to establish himself as a serious dramatic director but some scenes do feel unnecessarily artsy. But the thing the movie gets perfect is the two girls. Not only are they acted excellently, but they have a lot of dimension. It could have been easy for Jackson just to make them misunderstood, innocent people and while they seem to be like that in the first half, they also are portrayed as extremely sensitive and perhaps maybe a little mad. But once again, the film doesn't tell us how to feel about them, it lets us decide on our own. Another thing I appreciate is the camera-work. Sam Raimi's been listed on Wikipedia as one of his influences in filmmaking and it shows here because of the way he shoots his scenes and it looks excellent. Sadly though, his later films had abandoned this style of camera-work. Overall, while Jackson's direction can seem a little too artsy at times, the film is wonderfully-acted, well-shot, and beautifully ambiguous so I'm gonna give it a 8/10.

    New Zealand screenwriter, producer and director Peter Jackson's fourth feature film which he co-wrote with New Zealand screenwriter, producer and lyricist Frances Walsh and co-produced, is inspired by the Parker-Hulme murder case from 1954 which took place in Christchurch on the South Island of New Zealand where the film was shot. It premiered In competition at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994 and is a New Zealand production which was produced by New Zealand producer Jim Booth (1945-1994). It tells the story about two 15-year-old students named Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme who meets at a girls' secondary school in Christchurch during a summer in the early 1950s. Pauline and Juliet becomes best friends and creates their own secluded imaginary world, but when their parents begins worrying about their behavior and the nature of their relationship, they try to separate them. Distinctly and finely directed by New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson, this rhythmic, biographical and fictional story which is narrated by and from the two female protagonists viewpoints, draws a distinct portrayal of a malicious and unruly friendship between two aspiring writers. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by New Zealand production designer Grant Major, cinematography by New Zealand cinematographer Alun Bollinger and fine costume design by New Zealand costume designer Ngila Dickson and use of sound, this character-driven, narrative-driven and fairy-tale-like psychological thriller depicts two interrelated and in-depth studies of character and contains a great score by New Zealand composer Peter Dasent. This darkly humorous, significantly atmospheric and remarkable coming-of-age indie from the early 1990s which is set during a summer in 1954 in a city in New Zealand, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, eccentric characters, fine editing by New Zealand film editor Jamie Selkirk and the prominent and brilliant acting performances by New Zealand actress Melanie Lynskey, English actress Kate Winslet and the fine supporting acting performance by New Zealand actress Sarah Pierse. A surreal, sensual, inventive and wickedly romantic crime drama which gained, among numerous other awards, the Silver Lion Peter Jackson at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994.

    I came into the movie at the halfway mark and watched the rest from there, something entirely out of character for me but I knew Peter Jackson had directed this and I wanted to see what it was about. (I didn't know anything about the back story or that it was real.) I haven't seen everything he's done but it looked like he was diving into a completely different kind of subject matter than some of his movies, so I gave it a shot. In all honesty, I hate movies like this. Head trippy, psychological thrillers do nothing for me. In fact, I was going in a completely different direction for a while. I kept laughing, inappropriately as it turns out. The main girl's expression was so ridiculous and funny, and that hair...lumbering around like Bigfoot...she looked like a female version of Peter lol. But I was soon to find out all these tidbits of levity were not important to the story. Predictably, it turns into a love story because that's what a lot of teenagers do, they experiment and fall in love at the drop of a hat. So now that we're supposed to believe that they're in love, of which I never do (it doesn't come across as anything other than horny teenagers having sex), their desperation combined with their insanity turns deadly. Now I've gone from laughing at some silly scenes to somehow believing these girls are capable of bludgeoning someone to death and not just someone, her own mother. I'm sorry, but nothing in this movie convinced me of the events that could lead up to this. It almost seems like the filmmakers were glorifying this event rather than chronicling it. I just don't see real hate. I don't see real love. I don't see real anguish, except by Kate Winslet who seems to be upset by the littlest of things. Perhaps watching the entire movie would shed more light but having seen what I've seen I don't think it would change my opinion of it. Frankly, I'm glad I didn't pay any money for this. I'm not saying it's wholly bad, if you like psychological thrillers, go for it. Psych. thrillers in general don't make any sense but you're supposed to allow yourself to go along with the ride, no matter how silly or unbelievable it gets, so if that's what you like, you should be good here. I applaud Peter for attempting such a subject matter, especially since it's a true story. But I really don't think we need any more first-person accounts of real-life murders anymore. There wasn't anything beautiful about this story. That would be like saying the Lizzie Borden murders were beautiful. No, this is just sad and should have been portrayed in an appropriate way, if nothing else, for the families. Plus, it would have been great for those of us who weren't rooting for them to see those witches for what they really are and not try to get us to feel sorry for them.

    It was hard to believe that horror specialist Jackson, who's Braindead is one of the goriest movies ever delivered, could make a movie that is so lovely, sweet en gorgeous as Heavenly Creatures. Now he is one of the greatest directors who's working now because of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the remake of King Kong and The Hobbit. For me this was the beginning of a great director's life. Two girls, the uncertain Lynskey and the 'wild' Winslet, live in the 50s in the conservative New Zealand and have a close friendship. To close, or so their parents say. They fear that their daughters are lesbians. The two lose themselves completely in their together fantasized medieval fantasy world. When they threaten to be torn away from each other, Lynskey gets the plan to murder her mother, with disastrous consequences. The two young, debuting actresses deliver great performances, and are helped by a strong adult cast. In Venice awarded a Golden Lion and the screenplay by Jackson and Frances Walsh was nominated for an Oscar. Three years later, Winslet would become world famous by her role in the blockbuster Titanic. Great drama, great effects, great acting and great but sad story.

    Pauline Parker is a misguided adolescent. She is blinded by the belief that her best buddy Juliet Hulme's family is the ideal one where she belongs. Her foolish ignorance of the love, care and affection given by her own middle-class parents can be especially found when she does not consider the fact that it is her mother who always takes notice of her feeling and tries talking to her, like when Pauline is sad about Juliet contacting tuberculosis or when she is sitting in one corner away from the rest of her family. Pauline's vivid imagination also innocently made Dr. Henry Hulme (Juliet's dad) a hero, when in reality he was a major cause for the separation of the two girls. She may have a wider knowledge and a greater imagination than her mother, but she also was bafflingly stupid and ungrateful for believing her mother was the main enemy in the film. The unfortunate incident of the mother's murder would not have happened at all had Juliet not entered Pauline's life and poisoned it with deluded thoughts about the Fourth World. If Pauline is misguided, Juliet is the main cause for leading her buddy astray. I really don't know how to take the fact that this same Juliet is a best-selling author now, because the movie unflatteringly portrays her as a cankerous albeit intelligent mind who thinks 'scars are romantic'. Pauline meanwhile leads a reclusive life at a school, ashamed of her dark and twisted past and seeking redemption possibly by nurturing school children to be unlike what she had been. The sensational murder case of Honora Parker by her own daughter Pauline and her best friend (and lover probably) Juliet Hulme is brought to screen in a fascinating and unorthodox fashion by auteur director- scriptwriter Peter Jackson. Though not as talked about as cases like Black Dahlia or the Moors Murders, the 1954 murder case is still a very intriguing one for the plain reason that it was hard to fathom that two very intelligent girls could turn into cold-blooded murderers of one's own mother. Also to be considered is the relationship between the two girls who are seemingly lesbians yet it cannot be entirely confirmed as they do not show much attraction towards other girls. The diaries written by Pauline refer to the girls' communion with 'saints' in the Fourth world who are mostly made of actors like Orson Welles, and thus act as a major source material for the film and another reason for raising curiosity about the case. Peter Jackson is not one to keep it straight; much like David Lynch he has his directorial mark etched all over the film. Heavenly Angels does not start with court proceedings, and neither does it show the arrest of the two girls. It lets us enter and experience the 'mental music' of the girls themselves rather than presenting its events informally through banal court sessions. Jackson's transition from Braindead to Heavenly Children and following transition to Lord of the Rings is clearly visible in Heavenly Children, which seems to possess both the stylistic characteristics of the preceding and succeeding films. Not only do the characters give slightly mannered performances that recalls the over- the-top acting in Braindead (such as a scene in the first quarter where Pauline's father holds a fish in his hands and pretends to sing while the record of Mario Lanza plays on), but certain characters also give us impressions of characters from Braindead (especially the timid boarders at Pauline's home who are quite similar to Braindead's male protagonist). On the other hand, Juliet dressed as a princess chasing Pauline, with white horses in the background may recall magical sequences from LOTR series; I may be wrong in saying this since I have not seen the Lord of the Ring series. There are a number of brilliantly choreographed sequences, especially the montage showing Pauline's and Juliet's happy days together, lightened with Mario Lanza's arresting music. Some involve lighthearted humor that nevertheless act as a presage for the girls' worsening behavior, such as the hilarious scene at the hospital where Juliet is approached by a middle-aged man who rambles about Christ and placing faith in Christianity and is ultimately beheaded albeit in Juliet's mind by one of the saints. The most unnerving part is reserved for the end where the characters the camera movements slow down and silence becomes more pronounced, with only a background score playing solemnly as we brace ourselves to watch that dreadful part. Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in each and every scene; apart from one scene involving the girls discussing about each others' scars where she sounds too crazy, she successfully makes Juliet a highly mentally fragile female whose attachment to her fantasy life and Fourth World acts as a catalyst for the disruption of the lives of the two families. She also excellently plays the brutal murder scene, rightly giving the 'should-we-really-do-this' look to Juliet. But Melanie is the true star here, doing a great job performing the difficult role of Pauline. Not only do her expressions, her lack of eye contact and her defensive sitting posture accurately portray the role she is playing of a socially awkward teenager, but Lyndskey also gives her character Pauline a unique manner of smiling where her nose crinkles up as she smiles. And both actresses play their characters with damn seriousness even during the hallucination sequences, which is a tough job for such a young pair of ladies. Also, Sarah Peirse is terrific in her slightly straightforward role as the mother who is the only one taking an effort to understand what's wrong with her daughter. I unfortunately do not have the unrated version of the movie which is slightly longer but would have nevertheless remained useful because I've read it contains scenes involving Juliet's mother's affair with one of the patients. 'Heavenly' Recommended.

    We all know Peter Jackson as the man who directed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: but his early days as a director of horror-comedies. His 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures, based on a real-life murder, was his first step away from that genre and show what else he was capable of. In 1952 Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) is a social outsider who does not get on well with her peers at her school in Christchuch, New Zealand. But at the start of the new term she befriends a new student, English girl Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet). Both had childhood illnesses and they bond through their imagination, their creation of a fantasy world and have a love of music, particularly Mario Lanza. But their friendship slowly turns to obsession with each other, becoming extremely close, they find it hard to separate fantasy from reality and their fantasies become more and more violent. Mixed with their personal troubles their parents try to separate them, resulting with them planning a murder. Heavenly Creatures is a wonderfully made film and it was very Kubrickian in its approach. The lighting and use of shadows, colours and camera movement made the film look very much like Stanley Kubrick film and this was the type of story that would interested the man. The use of narrator also felt very similar to how Kubrick would let us know the thoughts of our main character. This film does have a great feeling of being like A Clockwork Orange, Lolita and The Shining, even though they are different films. We got the suburban setting of Lolita, the out of control youths from A Clockwork Orange and the theme of insanity and fantasy from The Shinning. On the wider front of Jackson's direction it was faultless. The pacing was perfect (I watched the 95 minute cut), the special effects were great for the time (this was Weta's first film) and it blended well with the film. Despite the low budget the special effects worked well and shifted between light and upbeat to dark and creepy. There are excellent camera moments and editing trick to shift us from the world of reality to fantasy and it was fitting for the situation as the girls were loosing their minds or using their imagination to enact violence fantasies. There are a lot of themes and ideas being explored in Heavenly Creatures. The most obvious are obsession, insanity and mental health, the parent-child relationship and friendship, even if the result is detrimental. But there are other themes about adolescence, about how it was changing and there was little understand of this period. We see how adolescence is a period of transition, from the two girls having fantasies which turn darker and they start to embark on more adult ventures, even at their young age, but also making them vulnerable to being exploited. There is a lack of understanding and this was film was set in a period where we are children or adults and no in-between. There is a clique of attitudes and psychology of the period as well a look at differing of parenting approaches. Heavenly Creatures was the first film for Winslet and Lynskey and there were of course there excellent in their roles, playing two hardly complex, troubled girls. Both are very bright and imaginative and you can easily believe in their friendship and relationship and how unusually close they are. The adult actors too were very strong throughout and there were no weak links in a film about two teenage girls taking a very dark turn. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan then you need see Heavenly Creatures. Other wises Heavenly Creatures is worthy film both as a piece of dramatic storytelling, visual filmmaking and a thematic piece about obsessions and unhealthy relationships.

    Pauline(Melanie) is a loner at school. She becomes friends with Juliet(Kate Winslet in her debut role) who is the new girl in class. They spend a lot of time together. Winslet is writing a fantasy book and both begin to live the book. Their parents are not pleased with their proximity and decide to separate them. The girls have their own plan to get back at their parents. Superbly directed by Peter Jackson, this is based on events which occurred in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand in 1953 and 54. The acting by both the leads is excellent. The fantasy scenes are created brilliantly and the characters of the two sets of parents are given quality screen time. This is a must watch for the fans of true crime and good drama and acting. 3.5 out of 5.

    After directing his blood and gore splatter epics: Bad Taste, Meet The Feebles, and Braindead; Peter Jackson directed his very first mainstream film, long before his own adaption trilogy of The Lord of The Rings. "Heavenly Creatures" tells the story about Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juilet (Played by "Titanic" fame, Kate Winslet.), and how their homosexual relationship ends tragically after a murder escapade. It's all based on a true New Zealand story, which seems very odd, as a selection of scenes from the film are fantasy. There are many good reasons why this film is worth watching. The visuals are amazing, the emotion is strong and powerful, and the innocence and beauty of the main characters defines the film's title. I quite enjoyed Heavenly Creatures, and I can recommend it for those who like Peter Jackson's other films. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    Heavenly Creatures is one of the most fascinating films I've seen in a long time. The story is unique, to say the least. It's the true story of two girls, Pauline Parker(Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme(Kate Winslet) who have an unusual, obsessive relationship to the point where they're rumored to be lesbian and get broken up by their parents, enraged they decide to get back at them. What's interesting to me about this movie is how ambiguous it is. There's very little that actually gets explained directly to the audience. Sure, the logical reason they killed Parker's mother is because they didn't want to be broken up but their psychological reasonings are never really explained. In fact, this is one of the hardest reviews for me to write because it's so unique and open to interpretation but I'll try my best. I think the question this movie is trying to raise is should you listen to what society says or should you be who you really are. We don't see every bit of their lives but I assume that these girls prior meeting each other were social outcasts and loners and in a way, these girls were made for each other. They bond with each other extremely well because they're both highly imaginative, curious girls who have never been allowed to show who they really were because of the rules society had back then for how girls should behave. So when they hang out together, it's like they are freeing themselves of society's rules and entering their own world of storytelling, Mario Lanza(a tenor they idolize), and imagination. But their bond may have been too strong for each other because there was very few girls like them so they end up obsessing over one another to the point where the parents feel this relationship is unhealthy and decide to split them. But the film never really tells us whether or not, these parents are doing the right thing. It's all up to the viewer. Later on, the girls start planning out their murder and when it happens, it's one of the most disturbing murders ever filmed in my opinion. It isn't disturbing just because of how violent it is but more so because of how personal this murder is. They didn't do it to some stranger for money, they did it to someone they knew for a long time out of anger and frustration! And there's a moment where you see how Parker really regrets going with this decision, when she first strikes her mother with the brick, she starts tearing up. I read somewhere she didn't shed a tear in real life but that was a brilliant decision on Jackson's part as director and it adds a lot of nuance to her character. I think Jackson's directing feels a little too artsy in some scenes. He made this after making low-budget horror-comedy films like Bad Taste and Braindead and I think with this film, he was really trying to establish himself as a serious dramatic director but some scenes do feel unnecessarily artsy. But the thing the movie gets perfect is the two girls. Not only are they acted excellently, but they have a lot of dimension. It could have been easy for Jackson just to make them misunderstood, innocent people and while they seem to be like that in the first half, they also are portrayed as extremely sensitive and perhaps maybe a little mad. But once again, the film doesn't tell us how to feel about them, it lets us decide on our own. Another thing I appreciate is the camera-work. Sam Raimi's been listed on Wikipedia as one of his influences in filmmaking and it shows here because of the way he shoots his scenes and it looks excellent. Sadly though, his later films had abandoned this style of camera-work. Overall, while Jackson's direction can seem a little too artsy at times, the film is wonderfully-acted, well-shot, and beautifully ambiguous so I'm gonna give it a 8/10.

    the story was so basic yet so utter, so real yet so celestial, inhuman yet so human. the surface of my skin, all over body, roused and shuddered in solidarity as the play reached its final.../ it was the stretched reaction of the skin, towards the transcending sprite trying to "liberate" and "violate" the imposed limits of my self-space. I was left with two hands locked in each other, streams of tears in the eyes, echoing screams of the two in the ear... and plainly pinned to the black screen as the final credits were rolling. review on this film should not be polluted with words of speculation or expression, and I don't intend to go further. I have just one stand to present : This Film Should Merely "Be Seen".... Merely "Be Seen".... PS: I write these lines right after watching the movie, because as deductive, destructive polluting brain that i possess, i know i'm gonna compartmentalize the whole experience, movie, characters, and every element of it, during next few days...But for now...just for tonight,and since a long time... i'm gonna allow myself to turn off the top floor of my anatomy, and feel it with all cells of my flesh, as long as i can, as slowly as i can, this artistic drama that without notice, has been slipped into the mouth.. Do yourself a favor and don't ask or seek, just see!

    Heavenly Creatures is probably the most mature film Peter Jackson has ever made. It perfectly shows what his capable as director, storyteller and what he is missing nowadays - good editor. Peter Jackson has something that many directors lack nowadays - experience at making low-budget schlock. Making B-movies is the best way to learn your craft as a filmmaker and most importantly working with limited budgets, actors, visual effects and editing. And the end result is quite wonderful - we have a director who can tackle strange stories, makes a great use of visuals and is not afraid of getting gritty and brutal. Heavenly Creatures looks and feels like a Peter Jackson film. There are his signature camera movement, strange and over the top performances and his signature bizarre visuals. It never feels like a realistic because of the way it's shot and acted since the story is very demented, dark and tragic in it's nature. The performances are all over the place and quite goofy most of the time. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey provide the central performances of the film and they are absolutely great in a demented sort of way. The only problem is the fact that look slightly older than they are supposed to be which can be distracting at times. The supporting cast is as over the top and loony as you can get but it perfectly fits the vision of the film. The only real problem I had with Heavenly Creatures was the ending. It felt rushed and somewhat poorly done. Most of these film that are based on true events, end fairly abruptly and feature a lame text crawl. It's a clich&eacute; that needs to stop because feature films need a rock solid conclusion not some abrupt ending. A Man Who was Superman had wonderful ending despite the fact it was based on true story... Despite it's lame ending, Heavenly Creatures is a wonderful film that showcases the strangest mainstream director of our time moving from gory B-movies to serious art-house cinema. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan, Kate Winslet fan or just a fan of interesting films, Heavenly Creatures is a must see.

    New Zealand screenwriter, producer and director Peter Jackson's fourth feature film which he co-wrote with New Zealand screenwriter, producer and lyricist Frances Walsh and co-produced, is inspired by the Parker-Hulme murder case from 1954 which took place in Christchurch on the South Island of New Zealand where the film was shot. It premiered In competition at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994 and is a New Zealand production which was produced by New Zealand producer Jim Booth (1945-1994). It tells the story about two 15-year-old students named Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme who meets at a girls' secondary school in Christchurch during a summer in the early 1950s. Pauline and Juliet becomes best friends and creates their own secluded imaginary world, but when their parents begins worrying about their behavior and the nature of their relationship, they try to separate them. Distinctly and finely directed by New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson, this rhythmic, biographical and fictional story which is narrated by and from the two female protagonists viewpoints, draws a distinct portrayal of a malicious and unruly friendship between two aspiring writers.

    It was hard to believe that horror specialist Jackson, who's Braindead is one of the goriest movies ever delivered, could make a movie that is so lovely, sweet en gorgeous as Heavenly Creatures. Now he is one of the greatest directors who's working now because of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the remake of King Kong and The Hobbit. For me this was the beginning of a great director's life. Two girls, the uncertain Lynskey and the 'wild' Winslet, live in the 50s in the conservative New Zealand and have a close friendship. To close, or so their parents say. They fear that their daughters are lesbians. The two lose themselves completely in their together fantasized medieval fantasy world. When they threaten to be torn away from each other, Lynskey gets the plan to murder her mother, with disastrous consequences. The two young, debuting actresses deliver great performances, and are helped by a strong adult cast. In Venice awarded a Golden Lion and the screenplay by Jackson and Frances Walsh was nominated for an Oscar. Three years later, Winslet would become world famous by her role in the blockbuster Titanic. Great drama, great effects, great acting and great but sad story.

    Pauline Parker is a misguided adolescent. She is blinded by the belief that her best buddy Juliet Hulme's family is the ideal one where she belongs. Her foolish ignorance of the love, care and affection given by her own middle-class parents can be especially found when she does not consider the fact that it is her mother who always takes notice of her feeling and tries talking to her, like when Pauline is sad about Juliet contacting tuberculosis or when she is sitting in one corner away from the rest of her family. Pauline's vivid imagination also innocently made Dr. Henry Hulme (Juliet's dad) a hero, when in reality he was a major cause for the separation of the two girls. She may have a wider knowledge and a greater imagination than her mother, but she also was bafflingly stupid and ungrateful for believing her mother was the main enemy in the film. The unfortunate incident of the mother's murder would not have happened at all had Juliet not entered Pauline's life and poisoned it with deluded thoughts about the Fourth World. If Pauline is misguided, Juliet is the main cause for leading her buddy astray. I really don't know how to take the fact that this same Juliet is a best-selling author now, because the movie unflatteringly portrays her as a cankerous albeit intelligent mind who thinks 'scars are romantic'. Pauline meanwhile leads a reclusive life at a school, ashamed of her dark and twisted past and seeking redemption possibly by nurturing school children to be unlike what she had been. The sensational murder case of Honora Parker by her own daughter Pauline and her best friend (and lover probably) Juliet Hulme is brought to screen in a fascinating and unorthodox fashion by auteur director- scriptwriter Peter Jackson. Though not as talked about as cases like Black Dahlia or the Moors Murders, the 1954 murder case is still a very intriguing one for the plain reason that it was hard to fathom that two very intelligent girls could turn into cold-blooded murderers of one's own mother. Also to be considered is the relationship between the two girls who are seemingly lesbians yet it cannot be entirely confirmed as they do not show much attraction towards other girls. The diaries written by Pauline refer to the girls' communion with 'saints' in the Fourth world who are mostly made of actors like Orson Welles, and thus act as a major source material for the film and another reason for raising curiosity about the case. Peter Jackson is not one to keep it straight; much like David Lynch he has his directorial mark etched all over the film. Heavenly Angels does not start with court proceedings, and neither does it show the arrest of the two girls. It lets us enter and experience the 'mental music' of the girls themselves rather than presenting its events informally through banal court sessions. Jackson's transition from Braindead to Heavenly Children and following transition to Lord of the Rings is clearly visible in Heavenly Children, which seems to possess both the stylistic characteristics of the preceding and succeeding films. Not only do the characters give slightly mannered performances that recalls the over- the-top acting in Braindead (such as a scene in the first quarter where Pauline's father holds a fish in his hands and pretends to sing while the record of Mario Lanza plays on), but certain characters also give us impressions of characters from Braindead (especially the timid boarders at Pauline's home who are quite similar to Braindead's male protagonist). On the other hand, Juliet dressed as a princess chasing Pauline, with white horses in the background may recall magical sequences from LOTR series; I may be wrong in saying this since I have not seen the Lord of the Ring series. There are a number of brilliantly choreographed sequences, especially the montage showing Pauline's and Juliet's happy days together, lightened with Mario Lanza's arresting music. Some involve lighthearted humor that nevertheless act as a presage for the girls' worsening behavior, such as the hilarious scene at the hospital where Juliet is approached by a middle-aged man who rambles about Christ and placing faith in Christianity and is ultimately beheaded albeit in Juliet's mind by one of the saints. The most unnerving part is reserved for the end where the characters the camera movements slow down and silence becomes more pronounced, with only a background score playing solemnly as we brace ourselves to watch that dreadful part. Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in each and every scene; apart from one scene involving the girls discussing about each others' scars where she sounds too crazy, she successfully makes Juliet a highly mentally fragile female whose attachment to her fantasy life and Fourth World acts as a catalyst for the disruption of the lives of the two families. She also excellently plays the brutal murder scene, rightly giving the 'should-we-really-do-this' look to Juliet. But Melanie is the true star here, doing a great job performing the difficult role of Pauline. Not only do her expressions, her lack of eye contact and her defensive sitting posture accurately portray the role she is playing of a socially awkward teenager, but Lyndskey also gives her character Pauline a unique manner of smiling where her nose crinkles up as she smiles. And both actresses play their characters with damn seriousness even during the hallucination sequences, which is a tough job for such a young pair of ladies. Also, Sarah Peirse is terrific in her slightly straightforward role as the mother who is the only one taking an effort to understand what's wrong with her daughter. I unfortunately do not have the unrated version of the movie which is slightly longer but would have nevertheless remained useful because I've read it contains scenes involving Juliet's mother's affair with one of the patients. 'Heavenly' Recommended.

    We all know Peter Jackson as the man who directed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: but his early days as a director of horror-comedies. His 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures, based on a real-life murder, was his first step away from that genre and show what else he was capable of. In 1952 Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) is a social outsider who does not get on well with her peers at her school in Christchuch, New Zealand. But at the start of the new term she befriends a new student, English girl Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet). Both had childhood illnesses and they bond through their imagination, their creation of a fantasy world and have a love of music, particularly Mario Lanza. But their friendship slowly turns to obsession with each other, becoming extremely close, they find it hard to separate fantasy from reality and their fantasies become more and more violent. Mixed with their personal troubles their parents try to separate them, resulting with them planning a murder. Heavenly Creatures is a wonderfully made film and it was very Kubrickian in its approach. The lighting and use of shadows, colours and camera movement made the film look very much like Stanley Kubrick film and this was the type of story that would interested the man. The use of narrator also felt very similar to how Kubrick would let us know the thoughts of our main character. This film does have a great feeling of being like A Clockwork Orange, Lolita and The Shining, even though they are different films. We got the suburban setting of Lolita, the out of control youths from A Clockwork Orange and the theme of insanity and fantasy from The Shinning. On the wider front of Jackson's direction it was faultless. The pacing was perfect (I watched the 95 minute cut), the special effects were great for the time (this was Weta's first film) and it blended well with the film. Despite the low budget the special effects worked well and shifted between light and upbeat to dark and creepy. There are excellent camera moments and editing trick to shift us from the world of reality to fantasy and it was fitting for the situation as the girls were loosing their minds or using their imagination to enact violence fantasies. There are a lot of themes and ideas being explored in Heavenly Creatures. The most obvious are obsession, insanity and mental health, the parent-child relationship and friendship, even if the result is detrimental. But there are other themes about adolescence, about how it was changing and there was little understand of this period. We see how adolescence is a period of transition, from the two girls having fantasies which turn darker and they start to embark on more adult ventures, even at their young age, but also making them vulnerable to being exploited. There is a lack of understanding and this was film was set in a period where we are children or adults and no in-between. There is a clique of attitudes and psychology of the period as well a look at differing of parenting approaches. Heavenly Creatures was the first film for Winslet and Lynskey and there were of course there excellent in their roles, playing two hardly complex, troubled girls. Both are very bright and imaginative and you can easily believe in their friendship and relationship and how unusually close they are. The adult actors too were very strong throughout and there were no weak links in a film about two teenage girls taking a very dark turn. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan then you need see Heavenly Creatures. Other wises Heavenly Creatures is worthy film both as a piece of dramatic storytelling, visual filmmaking and a thematic piece about obsessions and unhealthy relationships.

    Pauline(Melanie) is a loner at school. She becomes friends with Juliet(Kate Winslet in her debut role) who is the new girl in class. They spend a lot of time together. Winslet is writing a fantasy book and both begin to live the book. Their parents are not pleased with their proximity and decide to separate them. The girls have their own plan to get back at their parents. Superbly directed by Peter Jackson, this is based on events which occurred in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand in 1953 and 54. The acting by both the leads is excellent. The fantasy scenes are created brilliantly and the characters of the two sets of parents are given quality screen time. This is a must watch for the fans of true crime and good drama and acting. 3.5 out of 5.

    After directing his blood and gore splatter epics: Bad Taste, Meet The Feebles, and Braindead; Peter Jackson directed his very first mainstream film, long before his own adaption trilogy of The Lord of The Rings. "Heavenly Creatures" tells the story about Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juilet (Played by "Titanic" fame, Kate Winslet.), and how their homosexual relationship ends tragically after a murder escapade. It's all based on a true New Zealand story, which seems very odd, as a selection of scenes from the film are fantasy. There are many good reasons why this film is worth watching. The visuals are amazing, the emotion is strong and powerful, and the innocence and beauty of the main characters defines the film's title. I quite enjoyed Heavenly Creatures, and I can recommend it for those who like Peter Jackson's other films. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    Heavenly Creatures is one of the most fascinating films I've seen in a long time. The story is unique, to say the least. It's the true story of two girls, Pauline Parker(Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme(Kate Winslet) who have an unusual, obsessive relationship to the point where they're rumored to be lesbian and get broken up by their parents, enraged they decide to get back at them. What's interesting to me about this movie is how ambiguous it is. There's very little that actually gets explained directly to the audience. Sure, the logical reason they killed Parker's mother is because they didn't want to be broken up but their psychological reasonings are never really explained. In fact, this is one of the hardest reviews for me to write because it's so unique and open to interpretation but I'll try my best. I think the question this movie is trying to raise is should you listen to what society says or should you be who you really are. We don't see every bit of their lives but I assume that these girls prior meeting each other were social outcasts and loners and in a way, these girls were made for each other. They bond with each other extremely well because they're both highly imaginative, curious girls who have never been allowed to show who they really were because of the rules society had back then for how girls should behave. So when they hang out together, it's like they are freeing themselves of society's rules and entering their own world of storytelling, Mario Lanza(a tenor they idolize), and imagination. But their bond may have been too strong for each other because there was very few girls like them so they end up obsessing over one another to the point where the parents feel this relationship is unhealthy and decide to split them. But the film never really tells us whether or not, these parents are doing the right thing. It's all up to the viewer. Later on, the girls start planning out their murder and when it happens, it's one of the most disturbing murders ever filmed in my opinion. It isn't disturbing just because of how violent it is but more so because of how personal this murder is. They didn't do it to some stranger for money, they did it to someone they knew for a long time out of anger and frustration! And there's a moment where you see how Parker really regrets going with this decision, when she first strikes her mother with the brick, she starts tearing up. I read somewhere she didn't shed a tear in real life but that was a brilliant decision on Jackson's part as director and it adds a lot of nuance to her character. I think Jackson's directing feels a little too artsy in some scenes. He made this after making low-budget horror-comedy films like Bad Taste and Braindead and I think with this film, he was really trying to establish himself as a serious dramatic director but some scenes do feel unnecessarily artsy. But the thing the movie gets perfect is the two girls. Not only are they acted excellently, but they have a lot of dimension. It could have been easy for Jackson just to make them misunderstood, innocent people and while they seem to be like that in the first half, they also are portrayed as extremely sensitive and perhaps maybe a little mad. But once again, the film doesn't tell us how to feel about them, it lets us decide on our own. Another thing I appreciate is the camera-work. Sam Raimi's been listed on Wikipedia as one of his influences in filmmaking and it shows here because of the way he shoots his scenes and it looks excellent. Sadly though, his later films had abandoned this style of camera-work. Overall, while Jackson's direction can seem a little too artsy at times, the film is wonderfully-acted, well-shot, and beautifully ambiguous so I'm gonna give it a 8/10.

    the story was so basic yet so utter, so real yet so celestial, inhuman yet so human. the surface of my skin, all over body, roused and shuddered in solidarity as the play reached its final.../ it was the stretched reaction of the skin, towards the transcending sprite trying to "liberate" and "violate" the imposed limits of my self-space. I was left with two hands locked in each other, streams of tears in the eyes, echoing screams of the two in the ear... and plainly pinned to the black screen as the final credits were rolling. review on this film should not be polluted with words of speculation or expression, and I don't intend to go further. I have just one stand to present : This Film Should Merely "Be Seen".... Merely "Be Seen".... PS: I write these lines right after watching the movie, because as deductive, destructive polluting brain that i possess, i know i'm gonna compartmentalize the whole experience, movie, characters, and every element of it, during next few days...But for now...just for tonight,and since a long time... i'm gonna allow myself to turn off the top floor of my anatomy, and feel it with all cells of my flesh, as long as i can, as slowly as i can, this artistic drama that without notice, has been slipped into the mouth.. Do yourself a favor and don't ask or seek, just see!

    Heavenly Creatures is probably the most mature film Peter Jackson has ever made. It perfectly shows what his capable as director, storyteller and what he is missing nowadays - good editor. Peter Jackson has something that many directors lack nowadays - experience at making low-budget schlock. Making B-movies is the best way to learn your craft as a filmmaker and most importantly working with limited budgets, actors, visual effects and editing. And the end result is quite wonderful - we have a director who can tackle strange stories, makes a great use of visuals and is not afraid of getting gritty and brutal. Heavenly Creatures looks and feels like a Peter Jackson film. There are his signature camera movement, strange and over the top performances and his signature bizarre visuals. It never feels like a realistic because of the way it's shot and acted since the story is very demented, dark and tragic in it's nature. The performances are all over the place and quite goofy most of the time. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey provide the central performances of the film and they are absolutely great in a demented sort of way. The only problem is the fact that look slightly older than they are supposed to be which can be distracting at times. The supporting cast is as over the top and loony as you can get but it perfectly fits the vision of the film. The only real problem I had with Heavenly Creatures was the ending. It felt rushed and somewhat poorly done. Most of these film that are based on true events, end fairly abruptly and feature a lame text crawl. It's a clich&eacute; that needs to stop because feature films need a rock solid conclusion not some abrupt ending. A Man Who was Superman had wonderful ending despite the fact it was based on true story... Despite it's lame ending, Heavenly Creatures is a wonderful film that showcases the strangest mainstream director of our time moving from gory B-movies to serious art-house cinema. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan, Kate Winslet fan or just a fan of interesting films, Heavenly Creatures is a must see.

    New Zealand screenwriter, producer and director Peter Jackson's fourth feature film which he co-wrote with New Zealand screenwriter, producer and lyricist Frances Walsh and co-produced, is inspired by the Parker-Hulme murder case from 1954 which took place in Christchurch on the South Island of New Zealand where the film was shot. It premiered In competition at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994 and is a New Zealand production which was produced by New Zealand producer Jim Booth (1945-1994). It tells the story about two 15-year-old students named Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme who meets at a girls' secondary school in Christchurch during a summer in the early 1950s. Pauline and Juliet becomes best friends and creates their own secluded imaginary world, but when their parents begins worrying about their behavior and the nature of their relationship, they try to separate them. Distinctly and finely directed by New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson, this rhythmic, biographical and fictional story which is narrated by and from the two female protagonists viewpoints, draws a distinct portrayal of a malicious and unruly friendship between two aspiring writers. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by New Zealand production designer Grant Major, cinematography by New Zealand cinematographer Alun Bollinger and fine costume design by New Zealand costume designer Ngila Dickson and use of sound, this character-driven, narrative-driven and fairy-tale-like psychological thriller depicts two interrelated and in-depth studies of character and contains a great score by New Zealand composer Peter Dasent. This darkly humorous, significantly atmospheric and remarkable coming-of-age indie from the early 1990s which is set during a summer in 1954 in a city in New Zealand, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, eccentric characters, fine editing by New Zealand film editor Jamie Selkirk and the prominent and brilliant acting performances by New Zealand actress Melanie Lynskey, English actress Kate Winslet and the fine supporting acting performance by New Zealand actress Sarah Pierse. A surreal, sensual, inventive and wickedly romantic crime drama which gained, among numerous other awards, the Silver Lion Peter Jackson at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994.

    I came into the movie at the halfway mark and watched the rest from there, something entirely out of character for me but I knew Peter Jackson had directed this and I wanted to see what it was about. (I didn't know anything about the back story or that it was real.) I haven't seen everything he's done but it looked like he was diving into a completely different kind of subject matter than some of his movies, so I gave it a shot. In all honesty, I hate movies like this. Head trippy, psychological thrillers do nothing for me. In fact, I was going in a completely different direction for a while. I kept laughing, inappropriately as it turns out. The main girl's expression was so ridiculous and funny, and that hair...lumbering around like Bigfoot...she looked like a female version of Peter lol. But I was soon to find out all these tidbits of levity were not important to the story. Predictably, it turns into a love story because that's what a lot of teenagers do, they experiment and fall in love at the drop of a hat. So now that we're supposed to believe that they're in love, of which I never do (it doesn't come across as anything other than horny teenagers having sex), their desperation combined with their insanity turns deadly. Now I've gone from laughing at some silly scenes to somehow believing these girls are capable of bludgeoning someone to death and not just someone, her own mother. I'm sorry, but nothing in this movie convinced me of the events that could lead up to this. It almost seems like the filmmakers were glorifying this event rather than chronicling it. I just don't see real hate. I don't see real love. I don't see real anguish, except by Kate Winslet who seems to be upset by the littlest of things. Perhaps watching the entire movie would shed more light but having seen what I've seen I don't think it would change my opinion of it. Frankly, I'm glad I didn't pay any money for this. I'm not saying it's wholly bad, if you like psychological thrillers, go for it. Psych. thrillers in general don't make any sense but you're supposed to allow yourself to go along with the ride, no matter how silly or unbelievable it gets, so if that's what you like, you should be good here. I applaud Peter for attempting such a subject matter, especially since it's a true story. But I really don't think we need any more first-person accounts of real-life murders anymore. There wasn't anything beautiful about this story. That would be like saying the Lizzie Borden murders were beautiful. No, this is just sad and should have been portrayed in an appropriate way, if nothing else, for the families. Plus, it would have been great for those of us who weren't rooting for them to see those witches for what they really are and not try to get us to feel sorry for them.

    It was hard to believe that horror specialist Jackson, who's Braindead is one of the goriest movies ever delivered, could make a movie that is so lovely, sweet en gorgeous as Heavenly Creatures. Now he is one of the greatest directors who's working now because of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the remake of King Kong and The Hobbit. For me this was the beginning of a great director's life. Two girls, the uncertain Lynskey and the 'wild' Winslet, live in the 50s in the conservative New Zealand and have a close friendship. To close, or so their parents say. They fear that their daughters are lesbians. The two lose themselves completely in their together fantasized medieval fantasy world. When they threaten to be torn away from each other, Lynskey gets the plan to murder her mother, with disastrous consequences. The two young, debuting actresses deliver great performances, and are helped by a strong adult cast. In Venice awarded a Golden Lion and the screenplay by Jackson and Frances Walsh was nominated for an Oscar. Three years later, Winslet would become world famous by her role in the blockbuster Titanic. Great drama, great effects, great acting and great but sad story.

She also excellently plays the brutal murder scene, rightly giving the 'should-we-really-do-this' look to Juliet. But Melanie is the true star here, doing a great job performing the difficult role of Pauline. Not only do her expressions, her lack of eye contact and her defensive sitting posture accurately portray the role she is playing of a socially awkward teenager, but Lyndskey also gives her character Pauline a unique manner of smiling where her nose crinkles up as she smiles. And both actresses play their characters with damn seriousness even during the hallucination sequences, which is a tough job for such a young pair of ladies. Also, Sarah Peirse is terrific in her slightly straightforward role as the mother who is the only one taking an effort to understand what's wrong with her daughter. I unfortunately do not have the unrated version of the movie which is slightly longer but would have nevertheless remained useful because I've read it contains scenes involving Juliet's mother's affair with one of the patients.

    We all know Peter Jackson as the man who directed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: but his early days as a director of horror-comedies. His 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures, based on a real-life murder, was his first step away from that genre and show what else he was capable of. In 1952 Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) is a social outsider who does not get on well with her peers at her school in Christchuch, New Zealand. But at the start of the new term she befriends a new student, English girl Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet). Both had childhood illnesses and they bond through their imagination, their creation of a fantasy world and have a love of music, particularly Mario Lanza. But their friendship slowly turns to obsession with each other, becoming extremely close, they find it hard to separate fantasy from reality and their fantasies become more and more violent. Mixed with their personal troubles their parents try to separate them, resulting with them planning a murder. Heavenly Creatures is a wonderfully made film and it was very Kubrickian in its approach. The lighting and use of shadows, colours and camera movement made the film look very much like Stanley Kubrick film and this was the type of story that would interested the man. The use of narrator also felt very similar to how Kubrick would let us know the thoughts of our main character. This film does have a great feeling of being like A Clockwork Orange, Lolita and The Shining, even though they are different films. We got the suburban setting of Lolita, the out of control youths from A Clockwork Orange and the theme of insanity and fantasy from The Shinning. On the wider front of Jackson's direction it was faultless. The pacing was perfect (I watched the 95 minute cut), the special effects were great for the time (this was Weta's first film) and it blended well with the film. Despite the low budget the special effects worked well and shifted between light and upbeat to dark and creepy. There are excellent camera moments and editing trick to shift us from the world of reality to fantasy and it was fitting for the situation as the girls were loosing their minds or using their imagination to enact violence fantasies. There are a lot of themes and ideas being explored in Heavenly Creatures. The most obvious are obsession, insanity and mental health, the parent-child relationship and friendship, even if the result is detrimental. But there are other themes about adolescence, about how it was changing and there was little understand of this period. We see how adolescence is a period of transition, from the two girls having fantasies which turn darker and they start to embark on more adult ventures, even at their young age, but also making them vulnerable to being exploited. There is a lack of understanding and this was film was set in a period where we are children or adults and no in-between. There is a clique of attitudes and psychology of the period as well a look at differing of parenting approaches. Heavenly Creatures was the first film for Winslet and Lynskey and there were of course there excellent in their roles, playing two hardly complex, troubled girls. Both are very bright and imaginative and you can easily believe in their friendship and relationship and how unusually close they are. The adult actors too were very strong throughout and there were no weak links in a film about two teenage girls taking a very dark turn. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan then you need see Heavenly Creatures. Other wises Heavenly Creatures is worthy film both as a piece of dramatic storytelling, visual filmmaking and a thematic piece about obsessions and unhealthy relationships.

    Pauline(Melanie) is a loner at school. She becomes friends with Juliet(Kate Winslet in her debut role) who is the new girl in class. They spend a lot of time together. Winslet is writing a fantasy book and both begin to live the book. Their parents are not pleased with their proximity and decide to separate them. The girls have their own plan to get back at their parents. Superbly directed by Peter Jackson, this is based on events which occurred in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand in 1953 and 54. The acting by both the leads is excellent. The fantasy scenes are created brilliantly and the characters of the two sets of parents are given quality screen time. This is a must watch for the fans of true crime and good drama and acting. 3.5 out of 5.

    After directing his blood and gore splatter epics: Bad Taste, Meet The Feebles, and Braindead; Peter Jackson directed his very first mainstream film, long before his own adaption trilogy of The Lord of The Rings. "Heavenly Creatures" tells the story about Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juilet (Played by "Titanic" fame, Kate Winslet.), and how their homosexual relationship ends tragically after a murder escapade. It's all based on a true New Zealand story, which seems very odd, as a selection of scenes from the film are fantasy. There are many good reasons why this film is worth watching. The visuals are amazing, the emotion is strong and powerful, and the innocence and beauty of the main characters defines the film's title. I quite enjoyed Heavenly Creatures, and I can recommend it for those who like Peter Jackson's other films. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    Heavenly Creatures is one of the most fascinating films I've seen in a long time. The story is unique, to say the least. It's the true story of two girls, Pauline Parker(Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme(Kate Winslet) who have an unusual, obsessive relationship to the point where they're rumored to be lesbian and get broken up by their parents, enraged they decide to get back at them. What's interesting to me about this movie is how ambiguous it is. There's very little that actually gets explained directly to the audience. Sure, the logical reason they killed Parker's mother is because they didn't want to be broken up but their psychological reasonings are never really explained. In fact, this is one of the hardest reviews for me to write because it's so unique and open to interpretation but I'll try my best. I think the question this movie is trying to raise is should you listen to what society says or should you be who you really are. We don't see every bit of their lives but I assume that these girls prior meeting each other were social outcasts and loners and in a way, these girls were made for each other. They bond with each other extremely well because they're both highly imaginative, curious girls who have never been allowed to show who they really were because of the rules society had back then for how girls should behave. So when they hang out together, it's like they are freeing themselves of society's rules and entering their own world of storytelling, Mario Lanza(a tenor they idolize), and imagination. But their bond may have been too strong for each other because there was very few girls like them so they end up obsessing over one another to the point where the parents feel this relationship is unhealthy and decide to split them. But the film never really tells us whether or not, these parents are doing the right thing. It's all up to the viewer. Later on, the girls start planning out their murder and when it happens, it's one of the most disturbing murders ever filmed in my opinion. It isn't disturbing just because of how violent it is but more so because of how personal this murder is. They didn't do it to some stranger for money, they did it to someone they knew for a long time out of anger and frustration! And there's a moment where you see how Parker really regrets going with this decision, when she first strikes her mother with the brick, she starts tearing up. I read somewhere she didn't shed a tear in real life but that was a brilliant decision on Jackson's part as director and it adds a lot of nuance to her character. I think Jackson's directing feels a little too artsy in some scenes. He made this after making low-budget horror-comedy films like Bad Taste and Braindead and I think with this film, he was really trying to establish himself as a serious dramatic director but some scenes do feel unnecessarily artsy. But the thing the movie gets perfect is the two girls. Not only are they acted excellently, but they have a lot of dimension. It could have been easy for Jackson just to make them misunderstood, innocent people and while they seem to be like that in the first half, they also are portrayed as extremely sensitive and perhaps maybe a little mad. But once again, the film doesn't tell us how to feel about them, it lets us decide on our own. Another thing I appreciate is the camera-work. Sam Raimi's been listed on Wikipedia as one of his influences in filmmaking and it shows here because of the way he shoots his scenes and it looks excellent. Sadly though, his later films had abandoned this style of camera-work. Overall, while Jackson's direction can seem a little too artsy at times, the film is wonderfully-acted, well-shot, and beautifully ambiguous so I'm gonna give it a 8/10.

    the story was so basic yet so utter, so real yet so celestial, inhuman yet so human. the surface of my skin, all over body, roused and shuddered in solidarity as the play reached its final.../ it was the stretched reaction of the skin, towards the transcending sprite trying to "liberate" and "violate" the imposed limits of my self-space. I was left with two hands locked in each other, streams of tears in the eyes, echoing screams of the two in the ear... and plainly pinned to the black screen as the final credits were rolling. review on this film should not be polluted with words of speculation or expression, and I don't intend to go further. I have just one stand to present : This Film Should Merely "Be Seen".... Merely "Be Seen".... PS: I write these lines right after watching the movie, because as deductive, destructive polluting brain that i possess, i know i'm gonna compartmentalize the whole experience, movie, characters, and every element of it, during next few days...But for now...just for tonight,and since a long time... i'm gonna allow myself to turn off the top floor of my anatomy, and feel it with all cells of my flesh, as long as i can, as slowly as i can, this artistic drama that without notice, has been slipped into the mouth.. Do yourself a favor and don't ask or seek, just see!

    Heavenly Creatures is probably the most mature film Peter Jackson has ever made. It perfectly shows what his capable as director, storyteller and what he is missing nowadays - good editor. Peter Jackson has something that many directors lack nowadays - experience at making low-budget schlock. Making B-movies is the best way to learn your craft as a filmmaker and most importantly working with limited budgets, actors, visual effects and editing. And the end result is quite wonderful - we have a director who can tackle strange stories, makes a great use of visuals and is not afraid of getting gritty and brutal. Heavenly Creatures looks and feels like a Peter Jackson film. There are his signature camera movement, strange and over the top performances and his signature bizarre visuals. It never feels like a realistic because of the way it's shot and acted since the story is very demented, dark and tragic in it's nature. The performances are all over the place and quite goofy most of the time. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey provide the central performances of the film and they are absolutely great in a demented sort of way. The only problem is the fact that look slightly older than they are supposed to be which can be distracting at times. The supporting cast is as over the top and loony as you can get but it perfectly fits the vision of the film. The only real problem I had with Heavenly Creatures was the ending. It felt rushed and somewhat poorly done. Most of these film that are based on true events, end fairly abruptly and feature a lame text crawl. It's a clich&eacute; that needs to stop because feature films need a rock solid conclusion not some abrupt ending. A Man Who was Superman had wonderful ending despite the fact it was based on true story... Despite it's lame ending, Heavenly Creatures is a wonderful film that showcases the strangest mainstream director of our time moving from gory B-movies to serious art-house cinema. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan, Kate Winslet fan or just a fan of interesting films, Heavenly Creatures is a must see.

    New Zealand screenwriter, producer and director Peter Jackson's fourth feature film which he co-wrote with New Zealand screenwriter, producer and lyricist Frances Walsh and co-produced, is inspired by the Parker-Hulme murder case from 1954 which took place in Christchurch on the South Island of New Zealand where the film was shot. It premiered In competition at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994 and is a New Zealand production which was produced by New Zealand producer Jim Booth (1945-1994). It tells the story about two 15-year-old students named Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme who meets at a girls' secondary school in Christchurch during a summer in the early 1950s. Pauline and Juliet becomes best friends and creates their own secluded imaginary world, but when their parents begins worrying about their behavior and the nature of their relationship, they try to separate them. Distinctly and finely directed by New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson, this rhythmic, biographical and fictional story which is narrated by and from the two female protagonists viewpoints, draws a distinct portrayal of a malicious and unruly friendship between two aspiring writers. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by New Zealand production designer Grant Major, cinematography by New Zealand cinematographer Alun Bollinger and fine costume design by New Zealand costume designer Ngila Dickson and use of sound, this character-driven, narrative-driven and fairy-tale-like psychological thriller depicts two interrelated and in-depth studies of character and contains a great score by New Zealand composer Peter Dasent. This darkly humorous, significantly atmospheric and remarkable coming-of-age indie from the early 1990s which is set during a summer in 1954 in a city in New Zealand, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, eccentric characters, fine editing by New Zealand film editor Jamie Selkirk and the prominent and brilliant acting performances by New Zealand actress Melanie Lynskey, English actress Kate Winslet and the fine supporting acting performance by New Zealand actress Sarah Pierse. A surreal, sensual, inventive and wickedly romantic crime drama which gained, among numerous other awards, the Silver Lion Peter Jackson at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994.

    I came into the movie at the halfway mark and watched the rest from there, something entirely out of character for me but I knew Peter Jackson had directed this and I wanted to see what it was about. (I didn't know anything about the back story or that it was real.) I haven't seen everything he's done but it looked like he was diving into a completely different kind of subject matter than some of his movies, so I gave it a shot. In all honesty, I hate movies like this. Head trippy, psychological thrillers do nothing for me. In fact, I was going in a completely different direction for a while. I kept laughing, inappropriately as it turns out. The main girl's expression was so ridiculous and funny, and that hair...lumbering around like Bigfoot...she looked like a female version of Peter lol. But I was soon to find out all these tidbits of levity were not important to the story. Predictably, it turns into a love story because that's what a lot of teenagers do, they experiment and fall in love at the drop of a hat. So now that we're supposed to believe that they're in love, of which I never do (it doesn't come across as anything other than horny teenagers having sex), their desperation combined with their insanity turns deadly. Now I've gone from laughing at some silly scenes to somehow believing these girls are capable of bludgeoning someone to death and not just someone, her own mother. I'm sorry, but nothing in this movie convinced me of the events that could lead up to this. It almost seems like the filmmakers were glorifying this event rather than chronicling it. I just don't see real hate. I don't see real love. I don't see real anguish, except by Kate Winslet who seems to be upset by the littlest of things. Perhaps watching the entire movie would shed more light but having seen what I've seen I don't think it would change my opinion of it. Frankly, I'm glad I didn't pay any money for this. I'm not saying it's wholly bad, if you like psychological thrillers, go for it. Psych. thrillers in general don't make any sense but you're supposed to allow yourself to go along with the ride, no matter how silly or unbelievable it gets, so if that's what you like, you should be good here. I applaud Peter for attempting such a subject matter, especially since it's a true story. But I really don't think we need any more first-person accounts of real-life murders anymore. There wasn't anything beautiful about this story. That would be like saying the Lizzie Borden murders were beautiful. No, this is just sad and should have been portrayed in an appropriate way, if nothing else, for the families. Plus, it would have been great for those of us who weren't rooting for them to see those witches for what they really are and not try to get us to feel sorry for them.

    It was hard to believe that horror specialist Jackson, who's Braindead is one of the goriest movies ever delivered, could make a movie that is so lovely, sweet en gorgeous as Heavenly Creatures. Now he is one of the greatest directors who's working now because of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the remake of King Kong and The Hobbit. For me this was the beginning of a great director's life. Two girls, the uncertain Lynskey and the 'wild' Winslet, live in the 50s in the conservative New Zealand and have a close friendship. To close, or so their parents say. They fear that their daughters are lesbians. The two lose themselves completely in their together fantasized medieval fantasy world. When they threaten to be torn away from each other, Lynskey gets the plan to murder her mother, with disastrous consequences. The two young, debuting actresses deliver great performances, and are helped by a strong adult cast. In Venice awarded a Golden Lion and the screenplay by Jackson and Frances Walsh was nominated for an Oscar. Three years later, Winslet would become world famous by her role in the blockbuster Titanic. Great drama, great effects, great acting and great but sad story.

    Pauline Parker is a misguided adolescent. She is blinded by the belief that her best buddy Juliet Hulme's family is the ideal one where she belongs. Her foolish ignorance of the love, care and affection given by her own middle-class parents can be especially found when she does not consider the fact that it is her mother who always takes notice of her feeling and tries talking to her, like when Pauline is sad about Juliet contacting tuberculosis or when she is sitting in one corner away from the rest of her family. Pauline's vivid imagination also innocently made Dr. Henry Hulme (Juliet's dad) a hero, when in reality he was a major cause for the separation of the two girls. She may have a wider knowledge and a greater imagination than her mother, but she also was bafflingly stupid and ungrateful for believing her mother was the main enemy in the film. The unfortunate incident of the mother's murder would not have happened at all had Juliet not entered Pauline's life and poisoned it with deluded thoughts about the Fourth World. If Pauline is misguided, Juliet is the main cause for leading her buddy astray. I really don't know how to take the fact that this same Juliet is a best-selling author now, because the movie unflatteringly portrays her as a cankerous albeit intelligent mind who thinks 'scars are romantic'. Pauline meanwhile leads a reclusive life at a school, ashamed of her dark and twisted past and seeking redemption possibly by nurturing school children to be unlike what she had been. The sensational murder case of Honora Parker by her own daughter Pauline and her best friend (and lover probably) Juliet Hulme is brought to screen in a fascinating and unorthodox fashion by auteur director- scriptwriter Peter Jackson. Though not as talked about as cases like Black Dahlia or the Moors Murders, the 1954 murder case is still a very intriguing one for the plain reason that it was hard to fathom that two very intelligent girls could turn into cold-blooded murderers of one's own mother. Also to be considered is the relationship between the two girls who are seemingly lesbians yet it cannot be entirely confirmed as they do not show much attraction towards other girls. The diaries written by Pauline refer to the girls' communion with 'saints' in the Fourth world who are mostly made of actors like Orson Welles, and thus act as a major source material for the film and another reason for raising curiosity about the case. Peter Jackson is not one to keep it straight; much like David Lynch he has his directorial mark etched all over the film. Heavenly Angels does not start with court proceedings, and neither does it show the arrest of the two girls. It lets us enter and experience the 'mental music' of the girls themselves rather than presenting its events informally through banal court sessions. Jackson's transition from Braindead to Heavenly Children and following transition to Lord of the Rings is clearly visible in Heavenly Children, which seems to possess both the stylistic characteristics of the preceding and succeeding films. Not only do the characters give slightly mannered performances that recalls the over- the-top acting in Braindead (such as a scene in the first quarter where Pauline's father holds a fish in his hands and pretends to sing while the record of Mario Lanza plays on), but certain characters also give us impressions of characters from Braindead (especially the timid boarders at Pauline's home who are quite similar to Braindead's male protagonist). On the other hand, Juliet dressed as a princess chasing Pauline, with white horses in the background may recall magical sequences from LOTR series; I may be wrong in saying this since I have not seen the Lord of the Ring series. There are a number of brilliantly choreographed sequences, especially the montage showing Pauline's and Juliet's happy days together, lightened with Mario Lanza's arresting music. Some involve lighthearted humor that nevertheless act as a presage for the girls' worsening behavior, such as the hilarious scene at the hospital where Juliet is approached by a middle-aged man who rambles about Christ and placing faith in Christianity and is ultimately beheaded albeit in Juliet's mind by one of the saints. The most unnerving part is reserved for the end where the characters the camera movements slow down and silence becomes more pronounced, with only a background score playing solemnly as we brace ourselves to watch that dreadful part. Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in each and every scene; apart from one scene involving the girls discussing about each others' scars where she sounds too crazy, she successfully makes Juliet a highly mentally fragile female whose attachment to her fantasy life and Fourth World acts as a catalyst for the disruption of the lives of the two families. She also excellently plays the brutal murder scene, rightly giving the 'should-we-really-do-this' look to Juliet. But Melanie is the true star here, doing a great job performing the difficult role of Pauline. Not only do her expressions, her lack of eye contact and her defensive sitting posture accurately portray the role she is playing of a socially awkward teenager, but Lyndskey also gives her character Pauline a unique manner of smiling where her nose crinkles up as she smiles. And both actresses play their characters with damn seriousness even during the hallucination sequences, which is a tough job for such a young pair of ladies. Also, Sarah Peirse is terrific in her slightly straightforward role as the mother who is the only one taking an effort to understand what's wrong with her daughter. I unfortunately do not have the unrated version of the movie which is slightly longer but would have nevertheless remained useful because I've read it contains scenes involving Juliet's mother's affair with one of the patients. 'Heavenly' Recommended.

    We all know Peter Jackson as the man who directed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: but his early days as a director of horror-comedies. His 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures, based on a real-life murder, was his first step away from that genre and show what else he was capable of. In 1952 Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) is a social outsider who does not get on well with her peers at her school in Christchuch, New Zealand. But at the start of the new term she befriends a new student, English girl Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet). Both had childhood illnesses and they bond through their imagination, their creation of a fantasy world and have a love of music, particularly Mario Lanza. But their friendship slowly turns to obsession with each other, becoming extremely close, they find it hard to separate fantasy from reality and their fantasies become more and more violent. Mixed with their personal troubles their parents try to separate them, resulting with them planning a murder. Heavenly Creatures is a wonderfully made film and it was very Kubrickian in its approach. The lighting and use of shadows, colours and camera movement made the film look very much like Stanley Kubrick film and this was the type of story that would interested the man. The use of narrator also felt very similar to how Kubrick would let us know the thoughts of our main character. This film does have a great feeling of being like A Clockwork Orange, Lolita and The Shining, even though they are different films. We got the suburban setting of Lolita, the out of control youths from A Clockwork Orange and the theme of insanity and fantasy from The Shinning. On the wider front of Jackson's direction it was faultless. The pacing was perfect (I watched the 95 minute cut), the special effects were great for the time (this was Weta's first film) and it blended well with the film. Despite the low budget the special effects worked well and shifted between light and upbeat to dark and creepy. There are excellent camera moments and editing trick to shift us from the world of reality to fantasy and it was fitting for the situation as the girls were loosing their minds or using their imagination to enact violence fantasies. There are a lot of themes and ideas being explored in Heavenly Creatures. The most obvious are obsession, insanity and mental health, the parent-child relationship and friendship, even if the result is detrimental. But there are other themes about adolescence, about how it was changing and there was little understand of this period. We see how adolescence is a period of transition, from the two girls having fantasies which turn darker and they start to embark on more adult ventures, even at their young age, but also making them vulnerable to being exploited. There is a lack of understanding and this was film was set in a period where we are children or adults and no in-between. There is a clique of attitudes and psychology of the period as well a look at differing of parenting approaches. Heavenly Creatures was the first film for Winslet and Lynskey and there were of course there excellent in their roles, playing two hardly complex, troubled girls. Both are very bright and imaginative and you can easily believe in their friendship and relationship and how unusually close they are. The adult actors too were very strong throughout and there were no weak links in a film about two teenage girls taking a very dark turn. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan then you need see Heavenly Creatures. Other wises Heavenly Creatures is worthy film both as a piece of dramatic storytelling, visual filmmaking and a thematic piece about obsessions and unhealthy relationships.

    Heavenly Creatures is one of the most fascinating films I've seen in a long time. The story is unique, to say the least. It's the true story of two girls, Pauline Parker(Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme(Kate Winslet) who have an unusual, obsessive relationship to the point where they're rumored to be lesbian and get broken up by their parents, enraged they decide to get back at them. What's interesting to me about this movie is how ambiguous it is. There's very little that actually gets explained directly to the audience. Sure, the logical reason they killed Parker's mother is because they didn't want to be broken up but their psychological reasonings are never really explained. In fact, this is one of the hardest reviews for me to write because it's so unique and open to interpretation but I'll try my best. I think the question this movie is trying to raise is should you listen to what society says or should you be who you really are. We don't see every bit of their lives but I assume that these girls prior meeting each other were social outcasts and loners and in a way, these girls were made for each other. They bond with each other extremely well because they're both highly imaginative, curious girls who have never been allowed to show who they really were because of the rules society had back then for how girls should behave.

But their bond may have been too strong for each other because there was very few girls like them so they end up obsessing over one another to the point where the parents feel this relationship is unhealthy and decide to split them. But the film never really tells us whether or not, these parents are doing the right thing. It's all up to the viewer. Later on, the girls start planning out their murder and when it happens, it's one of the most disturbing murders ever filmed in my opinion. It isn't disturbing just because of how violent it is but more so because of how personal this murder is. They didn't do it to some stranger for money, they did it to someone they knew for a long time out of anger and frustration! And there's a moment where you see how Parker really regrets going with this decision, when she first strikes her mother with the brick, she starts tearing up. I read somewhere she didn't shed a tear in real life but that was a brilliant decision on Jackson's part as director and it adds a lot of nuance to her character. I think Jackson's directing feels a little too artsy in some scenes. He made this after making low-budget horror-comedy films like Bad Taste and Braindead and I think with this film, he was really trying to establish himself as a serious dramatic director but some scenes do feel unnecessarily artsy. But the thing the movie gets perfect is the two girls. Not only are they acted excellently, but they have a lot of dimension. It could have been easy for Jackson just to make them misunderstood, innocent people and while they seem to be like that in the first half, they also are portrayed as extremely sensitive and perhaps maybe a little mad. But once again, the film doesn't tell us how to feel about them, it lets us decide on our own. Another thing I appreciate is the camera-work. Sam Raimi's been listed on Wikipedia as one of his influences in filmmaking and it shows here because of the way he shoots his scenes and it looks excellent. Sadly though, his later films had abandoned this style of camera-work. Overall, while Jackson's direction can seem a little too artsy at times, the film is wonderfully-acted, well-shot, and beautifully ambiguous so I'm gonna give it a 8/10.

    the story was so basic yet so utter, so real yet so celestial, inhuman yet so human. the surface of my skin, all over body, roused and shuddered in solidarity as the play reached its final.../ it was the stretched reaction of the skin, towards the transcending sprite trying to "liberate" and "violate" the imposed limits of my self-space. I was left with two hands locked in each other, streams of tears in the eyes, echoing screams of the two in the ear... and plainly pinned to the black screen as the final credits were rolling. review on this film should not be polluted with words of speculation or expression, and I don't intend to go further. I have just one stand to present : This Film Should Merely "Be Seen".... Merely "Be Seen".... PS: I write these lines right after watching the movie, because as deductive, destructive polluting brain that i possess, i know i'm gonna compartmentalize the whole experience, movie, characters, and every element of it, during next few days...But for now...just for tonight,and since a long time... i'm gonna allow myself to turn off the top floor of my anatomy, and feel it with all cells of my flesh, as long as i can, as slowly as i can, this artistic drama that without notice, has been slipped into the mouth..

    Heavenly Creatures is probably the most mature film Peter Jackson has ever made. It perfectly shows what his capable as director, storyteller and what he is missing nowadays - good editor. Peter Jackson has something that many directors lack nowadays - experience at making low-budget schlock. Making B-movies is the best way to learn your craft as a filmmaker and most importantly working with limited budgets, actors, visual effects and editing. And the end result is quite wonderful - we have a director who can tackle strange stories, makes a great use of visuals and is not afraid of getting gritty and brutal. Heavenly Creatures looks and feels like a Peter Jackson film. There are his signature camera movement, strange and over the top performances and his signature bizarre visuals. It never feels like a realistic because of the way it's shot and acted since the story is very demented, dark and tragic in it's nature. The performances are all over the place and quite goofy most of the time. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey provide the central performances of the film and they are absolutely great in a demented sort of way. The only problem is the fact that look slightly older than they are supposed to be which can be distracting at times. The supporting cast is as over the top and loony as you can get but it perfectly fits the vision of the film. The only real problem I had with Heavenly Creatures was the ending. It felt rushed and somewhat poorly done. Most of these film that are based on true events, end fairly abruptly and feature a lame text crawl. It's a clich&eacute; that needs to stop because feature films need a rock solid conclusion not some abrupt ending. A Man Who was Superman had wonderful ending despite the fact it was based on true story... Despite it's lame ending, Heavenly Creatures is a wonderful film that showcases the strangest mainstream director of our time moving from gory B-movies to serious art-house cinema. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan, Kate Winslet fan or just a fan of interesting films, Heavenly Creatures is a must see.

    New Zealand screenwriter, producer and director Peter Jackson's fourth feature film which he co-wrote with New Zealand screenwriter, producer and lyricist Frances Walsh and co-produced, is inspired by the Parker-Hulme murder case from 1954 which took place in Christchurch on the South Island of New Zealand where the film was shot. It premiered In competition at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994 and is a New Zealand production which was produced by New Zealand producer Jim Booth (1945-1994). It tells the story about two 15-year-old students named Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme who meets at a girls' secondary school in Christchurch during a summer in the early 1950s. Pauline and Juliet becomes best friends and creates their own secluded imaginary world, but when their parents begins worrying about their behavior and the nature of their relationship, they try to separate them. Distinctly and finely directed by New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson, this rhythmic, biographical and fictional story which is narrated by and from the two female protagonists viewpoints, draws a distinct portrayal of a malicious and unruly friendship between two aspiring writers. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by New Zealand production designer Grant Major, cinematography by New Zealand cinematographer Alun Bollinger and fine costume design by New Zealand costume designer Ngila Dickson and use of sound, this character-driven, narrative-driven and fairy-tale-like psychological thriller depicts two interrelated and in-depth studies of character and contains a great score by New Zealand composer Peter Dasent. This darkly humorous, significantly atmospheric and remarkable coming-of-age indie from the early 1990s which is set during a summer in 1954 in a city in New Zealand, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, eccentric characters, fine editing by New Zealand film editor Jamie Selkirk and the prominent and brilliant acting performances by New Zealand actress Melanie Lynskey, English actress Kate Winslet and the fine supporting acting performance by New Zealand actress Sarah Pierse. A surreal, sensual, inventive and wickedly romantic crime drama which gained, among numerous other awards, the Silver Lion Peter Jackson at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994.

    I came into the movie at the halfway mark and watched the rest from there, something entirely out of character for me but I knew Peter Jackson had directed this and I wanted to see what it was about. (I didn't know anything about the back story or that it was real.) I haven't seen everything he's done but it looked like he was diving into a completely different kind of subject matter than some of his movies, so I gave it a shot. In all honesty, I hate movies like this. Head trippy, psychological thrillers do nothing for me. In fact, I was going in a completely different direction for a while. I kept laughing, inappropriately as it turns out. The main girl's expression was so ridiculous and funny, and that hair...lumbering around like Bigfoot...she looked like a female version of Peter lol. But I was soon to find out all these tidbits of levity were not important to the story. Predictably, it turns into a love story because that's what a lot of teenagers do, they experiment and fall in love at the drop of a hat. So now that we're supposed to believe that they're in love, of which I never do (it doesn't come across as anything other than horny teenagers having sex), their desperation combined with their insanity turns deadly. Now I've gone from laughing at some silly scenes to somehow believing these girls are capable of bludgeoning someone to death and not just someone, her own mother. I'm sorry, but nothing in this movie convinced me of the events that could lead up to this. It almost seems like the filmmakers were glorifying this event rather than chronicling it. I just don't see real hate. I don't see real love. I don't see real anguish, except by Kate Winslet who seems to be upset by the littlest of things. Perhaps watching the entire movie would shed more light but having seen what I've seen I don't think it would change my opinion of it. Frankly, I'm glad I didn't pay any money for this. I'm not saying it's wholly bad, if you like psychological thrillers, go for it. Psych. thrillers in general don't make any sense but you're supposed to allow yourself to go along with the ride, no matter how silly or unbelievable it gets, so if that's what you like, you should be good here. I applaud Peter for attempting such a subject matter, especially since it's a true story. But I really don't think we need any more first-person accounts of real-life murders anymore. There wasn't anything beautiful about this story. That would be like saying the Lizzie Borden murders were beautiful. No, this is just sad and should have been portrayed in an appropriate way, if nothing else, for the families. Plus, it would have been great for those of us who weren't rooting for them to see those witches for what they really are and not try to get us to feel sorry for them.

    It was hard to believe that horror specialist Jackson, who's Braindead is one of the goriest movies ever delivered, could make a movie that is so lovely, sweet en gorgeous as Heavenly Creatures. Now he is one of the greatest directors who's working now because of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the remake of King Kong and The Hobbit. For me this was the beginning of a great director's life. Two girls, the uncertain Lynskey and the 'wild' Winslet, live in the 50s in the conservative New Zealand and have a close friendship. To close, or so their parents say. They fear that their daughters are lesbians. The two lose themselves completely in their together fantasized medieval fantasy world. When they threaten to be torn away from each other, Lynskey gets the plan to murder her mother, with disastrous consequences. The two young, debuting actresses deliver great performances, and are helped by a strong adult cast. In Venice awarded a Golden Lion and the screenplay by Jackson and Frances Walsh was nominated for an Oscar. Three years later, Winslet would become world famous by her role in the blockbuster Titanic. Great drama, great effects, great acting and great but sad story.

    Pauline Parker is a misguided adolescent. She is blinded by the belief that her best buddy Juliet Hulme's family is the ideal one where she belongs. Her foolish ignorance of the love, care and affection given by her own middle-class parents can be especially found when she does not consider the fact that it is her mother who always takes notice of her feeling and tries talking to her, like when Pauline is sad about Juliet contacting tuberculosis or when she is sitting in one corner away from the rest of her family. Pauline's vivid imagination also innocently made Dr. Henry Hulme (Juliet's dad) a hero, when in reality he was a major cause for the separation of the two girls. She may have a wider knowledge and a greater imagination than her mother, but she also was bafflingly stupid and ungrateful for believing her mother was the main enemy in the film. The unfortunate incident of the mother's murder would not have happened at all had Juliet not entered Pauline's life and poisoned it with deluded thoughts about the Fourth World. If Pauline is misguided, Juliet is the main cause for leading her buddy astray. I really don't know how to take the fact that this same Juliet is a best-selling author now, because the movie unflatteringly portrays her as a cankerous albeit intelligent mind who thinks 'scars are romantic'. Pauline meanwhile leads a reclusive life at a school, ashamed of her dark and twisted past and seeking redemption possibly by nurturing school children to be unlike what she had been. The sensational murder case of Honora Parker by her own daughter Pauline and her best friend (and lover probably) Juliet Hulme is brought to screen in a fascinating and unorthodox fashion by auteur director- scriptwriter Peter Jackson. Though not as talked about as cases like Black Dahlia or the Moors Murders, the 1954 murder case is still a very intriguing one for the plain reason that it was hard to fathom that two very intelligent girls could turn into cold-blooded murderers of one's own mother. Also to be considered is the relationship between the two girls who are seemingly lesbians yet it cannot be entirely confirmed as they do not show much attraction towards other girls. The diaries written by Pauline refer to the girls' communion with 'saints' in the Fourth world who are mostly made of actors like Orson Welles, and thus act as a major source material for the film and another reason for raising curiosity about the case. Peter Jackson is not one to keep it straight; much like David Lynch he has his directorial mark etched all over the film. Heavenly Angels does not start with court proceedings, and neither does it show the arrest of the two girls. It lets us enter and experience the 'mental music' of the girls themselves rather than presenting its events informally through banal court sessions. Jackson's transition from Braindead to Heavenly Children and following transition to Lord of the Rings is clearly visible in Heavenly Children, which seems to possess both the stylistic characteristics of the preceding and succeeding films. Not only do the characters give slightly mannered performances that recalls the over- the-top acting in Braindead (such as a scene in the first quarter where Pauline's father holds a fish in his hands and pretends to sing while the record of Mario Lanza plays on), but certain characters also give us impressions of characters from Braindead (especially the timid boarders at Pauline's home who are quite similar to Braindead's male protagonist). On the other hand, Juliet dressed as a princess chasing Pauline, with white horses in the background may recall magical sequences from LOTR series; I may be wrong in saying this since I have not seen the Lord of the Ring series. There are a number of brilliantly choreographed sequences, especially the montage showing Pauline's and Juliet's happy days together, lightened with Mario Lanza's arresting music. Some involve lighthearted humor that nevertheless act as a presage for the girls' worsening behavior, such as the hilarious scene at the hospital where Juliet is approached by a middle-aged man who rambles about Christ and placing faith in Christianity and is ultimately beheaded albeit in Juliet's mind by one of the saints. The most unnerving part is reserved for the end where the characters the camera movements slow down and silence becomes more pronounced, with only a background score playing solemnly as we brace ourselves to watch that dreadful part. Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in each and every scene; apart from one scene involving the girls discussing about each others' scars where she sounds too crazy, she successfully makes Juliet a highly mentally fragile female whose attachment to her fantasy life and Fourth World acts as a catalyst for the disruption of the lives of the two families. She also excellently plays the brutal murder scene, rightly giving the 'should-we-really-do-this' look to Juliet. But Melanie is the true star here, doing a great job performing the difficult role of Pauline. Not only do her expressions, her lack of eye contact and her defensive sitting posture accurately portray the role she is playing of a socially awkward teenager, but Lyndskey also gives her character Pauline a unique manner of smiling where her nose crinkles up as she smiles. And both actresses play their characters with damn seriousness even during the hallucination sequences, which is a tough job for such a young pair of ladies. Also, Sarah Peirse is terrific in her slightly straightforward role as the mother who is the only one taking an effort to understand what's wrong with her daughter. I unfortunately do not have the unrated version of the movie which is slightly longer but would have nevertheless remained useful because I've read it contains scenes involving Juliet's mother's affair with one of the patients. 'Heavenly' Recommended.

    We all know Peter Jackson as the man who directed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: but his early days as a director of horror-comedies. His 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures, based on a real-life murder, was his first step away from that genre and show what else he was capable of. In 1952 Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) is a social outsider who does not get on well with her peers at her school in Christchuch, New Zealand. But at the start of the new term she befriends a new student, English girl Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet). Both had childhood illnesses and they bond through their imagination, their creation of a fantasy world and have a love of music, particularly Mario Lanza. But their friendship slowly turns to obsession with each other, becoming extremely close, they find it hard to separate fantasy from reality and their fantasies become more and more violent. Mixed with their personal troubles their parents try to separate them, resulting with them planning a murder. Heavenly Creatures is a wonderfully made film and it was very Kubrickian in its approach. The lighting and use of shadows, colours and camera movement made the film look very much like Stanley Kubrick film and this was the type of story that would interested the man. The use of narrator also felt very similar to how Kubrick would let us know the thoughts of our main character. This film does have a great feeling of being like A Clockwork Orange, Lolita and The Shining, even though they are different films. We got the suburban setting of Lolita, the out of control youths from A Clockwork Orange and the theme of insanity and fantasy from The Shinning. On the wider front of Jackson's direction it was faultless. The pacing was perfect (I watched the 95 minute cut), the special effects were great for the time (this was Weta's first film) and it blended well with the film. Despite the low budget the special effects worked well and shifted between light and upbeat to dark and creepy. There are excellent camera moments and editing trick to shift us from the world of reality to fantasy and it was fitting for the situation as the girls were loosing their minds or using their imagination to enact violence fantasies. There are a lot of themes and ideas being explored in Heavenly Creatures. The most obvious are obsession, insanity and mental health, the parent-child relationship and friendship, even if the result is detrimental. But there are other themes about adolescence, about how it was changing and there was little understand of this period. We see how adolescence is a period of transition, from the two girls having fantasies which turn darker and they start to embark on more adult ventures, even at their young age, but also making them vulnerable to being exploited. There is a lack of understanding and this was film was set in a period where we are children or adults and no in-between. There is a clique of attitudes and psychology of the period as well a look at differing of parenting approaches. Heavenly Creatures was the first film for Winslet and Lynskey and there were of course there excellent in their roles, playing two hardly complex, troubled girls. Both are very bright and imaginative and you can easily believe in their friendship and relationship and how unusually close they are. The adult actors too were very strong throughout and there were no weak links in a film about two teenage girls taking a very dark turn. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan then you need see Heavenly Creatures. Other wises Heavenly Creatures is worthy film both as a piece of dramatic storytelling, visual filmmaking and a thematic piece about obsessions and unhealthy relationships.

    Pauline(Melanie) is a loner at school. She becomes friends with Juliet(Kate Winslet in her debut role) who is the new girl in class. They spend a lot of time together. Winslet is writing a fantasy book and both begin to live the book. Their parents are not pleased with their proximity and decide to separate them. The girls have their own plan to get back at their parents. Superbly directed by Peter Jackson, this is based on events which occurred in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand in 1953 and 54. The acting by both the leads is excellent. The fantasy scenes are created brilliantly and the characters of the two sets of parents are given quality screen time. This is a must watch for the fans of true crime and good drama and acting. 3.5 out of 5.

    After directing his blood and gore splatter epics: Bad Taste, Meet The Feebles, and Braindead; Peter Jackson directed his very first mainstream film, long before his own adaption trilogy of The Lord of The Rings. "Heavenly Creatures" tells the story about Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juilet (Played by "Titanic" fame, Kate Winslet.), and how their homosexual relationship ends tragically after a murder escapade. It's all based on a true New Zealand story, which seems very odd, as a selection of scenes from the film are fantasy. There are many good reasons why this film is worth watching. The visuals are amazing, the emotion is strong and powerful, and the innocence and beauty of the main characters defines the film's title. I quite enjoyed Heavenly Creatures, and I can recommend it for those who like Peter Jackson's other films. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    Heavenly Creatures is one of the most fascinating films I've seen in a long time. The story is unique, to say the least. It's the true story of two girls, Pauline Parker(Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme(Kate Winslet) who have an unusual, obsessive relationship to the point where they're rumored to be lesbian and get broken up by their parents, enraged they decide to get back at them. What's interesting to me about this movie is how ambiguous it is. There's very little that actually gets explained directly to the audience. Sure, the logical reason they killed Parker's mother is because they didn't want to be broken up but their psychological reasonings are never really explained. In fact, this is one of the hardest reviews for me to write because it's so unique and open to interpretation but I'll try my best. I think the question this movie is trying to raise is should you listen to what society says or should you be who you really are. We don't see every bit of their lives but I assume that these girls prior meeting each other were social outcasts and loners and in a way, these girls were made for each other. They bond with each other extremely well because they're both highly imaginative, curious girls who have never been allowed to show who they really were because of the rules society had back then for how girls should behave. So when they hang out together, it's like they are freeing themselves of society's rules and entering their own world of storytelling, Mario Lanza(a tenor they idolize), and imagination. But their bond may have been too strong for each other because there was very few girls like them so they end up obsessing over one another to the point where the parents feel this relationship is unhealthy and decide to split them. But the film never really tells us whether or not, these parents are doing the right thing. It's all up to the viewer. Later on, the girls start planning out their murder and when it happens, it's one of the most disturbing murders ever filmed in my opinion. It isn't disturbing just because of how violent it is but more so because of how personal this murder is. They didn't do it to some stranger for money, they did it to someone they knew for a long time out of anger and frustration! And there's a moment where you see how Parker really regrets going with this decision, when she first strikes her mother with the brick, she starts tearing up. I read somewhere she didn't shed a tear in real life but that was a brilliant decision on Jackson's part as director and it adds a lot of nuance to her character. I think Jackson's directing feels a little too artsy in some scenes. He made this after making low-budget horror-comedy films like Bad Taste and Braindead and I think with this film, he was really trying to establish himself as a serious dramatic director but some scenes do feel unnecessarily artsy. But the thing the movie gets perfect is the two girls. Not only are they acted excellently, but they have a lot of dimension. It could have been easy for Jackson just to make them misunderstood, innocent people and while they seem to be like that in the first half, they also are portrayed as extremely sensitive and perhaps maybe a little mad. But once again, the film doesn't tell us how to feel about them, it lets us decide on our own. Another thing I appreciate is the camera-work. Sam Raimi's been listed on Wikipedia as one of his influences in filmmaking and it shows here because of the way he shoots his scenes and it looks excellent. Sadly though, his later films had abandoned this style of camera-work. Overall, while Jackson's direction can seem a little too artsy at times, the film is wonderfully-acted, well-shot, and beautifully ambiguous so I'm gonna give it a 8/10.

    New Zealand screenwriter, producer and director Peter Jackson's fourth feature film which he co-wrote with New Zealand screenwriter, producer and lyricist Frances Walsh and co-produced, is inspired by the Parker-Hulme murder case from 1954 which took place in Christchurch on the South Island of New Zealand where the film was shot. It premiered In competition at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994 and is a New Zealand production which was produced by New Zealand producer Jim Booth (1945-1994). It tells the story about two 15-year-old students named Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme who meets at a girls' secondary school in Christchurch during a summer in the early 1950s. Pauline and Juliet becomes best friends and creates their own secluded imaginary world, but when their parents begins worrying about their behavior and the nature of their relationship, they try to separate them. Distinctly and finely directed by New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson, this rhythmic, biographical and fictional story which is narrated by and from the two female protagonists viewpoints, draws a distinct portrayal of a malicious and unruly friendship between two aspiring writers. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by New Zealand production designer Grant Major, cinematography by New Zealand cinematographer Alun Bollinger and fine costume design by New Zealand costume designer Ngila Dickson and use of sound, this character-driven, narrative-driven and fairy-tale-like psychological thriller depicts two interrelated and in-depth studies of character and contains a great score by New Zealand composer Peter Dasent. This darkly humorous, significantly atmospheric and remarkable coming-of-age indie from the early 1990s which is set during a summer in 1954 in a city in New Zealand, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, eccentric characters, fine editing by New Zealand film editor Jamie Selkirk and the prominent and brilliant acting performances by New Zealand actress Melanie Lynskey, English actress Kate Winslet and the fine supporting acting performance by New Zealand actress Sarah Pierse. A surreal, sensual, inventive and wickedly romantic crime drama which gained, among numerous other awards, the Silver Lion Peter Jackson at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994.

    I came into the movie at the halfway mark and watched the rest from there, something entirely out of character for me but I knew Peter Jackson had directed this and I wanted to see what it was about. (I didn't know anything about the back story or that it was real.) I haven't seen everything he's done but it looked like he was diving into a completely different kind of subject matter than some of his movies, so I gave it a shot. In all honesty, I hate movies like this. Head trippy, psychological thrillers do nothing for me. In fact, I was going in a completely different direction for a while. I kept laughing, inappropriately as it turns out. The main girl's expression was so ridiculous and funny, and that hair...lumbering around like Bigfoot...she looked like a female version of Peter lol. But I was soon to find out all these tidbits of levity were not important to the story. Predictably, it turns into a love story because that's what a lot of teenagers do, they experiment and fall in love at the drop of a hat. So now that we're supposed to believe that they're in love, of which I never do (it doesn't come across as anything other than horny teenagers having sex), their desperation combined with their insanity turns deadly. Now I've gone from laughing at some silly scenes to somehow believing these girls are capable of bludgeoning someone to death and not just someone, her own mother. I'm sorry, but nothing in this movie convinced me of the events that could lead up to this. It almost seems like the filmmakers were glorifying this event rather than chronicling it. I just don't see real hate. I don't see real love. I don't see real anguish, except by Kate Winslet who seems to be upset by the littlest of things. Perhaps watching the entire movie would shed more light but having seen what I've seen I don't think it would change my opinion of it. Frankly, I'm glad I didn't pay any money for this. I'm not saying it's wholly bad, if you like psychological thrillers, go for it. Psych. thrillers in general don't make any sense but you're supposed to allow yourself to go along with the ride, no matter how silly or unbelievable it gets, so if that's what you like, you should be good here. I applaud Peter for attempting such a subject matter, especially since it's a true story. But I really don't think we need any more first-person accounts of real-life murders anymore. There wasn't anything beautiful about this story. That would be like saying the Lizzie Borden murders were beautiful. No, this is just sad and should have been portrayed in an appropriate way, if nothing else, for the families. Plus, it would have been great for those of us who weren't rooting for them to see those witches for what they really are and not try to get us to feel sorry for them.

    It was hard to believe that horror specialist Jackson, who's Braindead is one of the goriest movies ever delivered, could make a movie that is so lovely, sweet en gorgeous as Heavenly Creatures. Now he is one of the greatest directors who's working now because of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the remake of King Kong and The Hobbit. For me this was the beginning of a great director's life. Two girls, the uncertain Lynskey and the 'wild' Winslet, live in the 50s in the conservative New Zealand and have a close friendship. To close, or so their parents say. They fear that their daughters are lesbians. The two lose themselves completely in their together fantasized medieval fantasy world. When they threaten to be torn away from each other, Lynskey gets the plan to murder her mother, with disastrous consequences. The two young, debuting actresses deliver great performances, and are helped by a strong adult cast. In Venice awarded a Golden Lion and the screenplay by Jackson and Frances Walsh was nominated for an Oscar. Three years later, Winslet would become world famous by her role in the blockbuster Titanic. Great drama, great effects, great acting and great but sad story.

    Pauline Parker is a misguided adolescent. She is blinded by the belief that her best buddy Juliet Hulme's family is the ideal one where she belongs. Her foolish ignorance of the love, care and affection given by her own middle-class parents can be especially found when she does not consider the fact that it is her mother who always takes notice of her feeling and tries talking to her, like when Pauline is sad about Juliet contacting tuberculosis or when she is sitting in one corner away from the rest of her family. Pauline's vivid imagination also innocently made Dr. Henry Hulme (Juliet's dad) a hero, when in reality he was a major cause for the separation of the two girls. She may have a wider knowledge and a greater imagination than her mother, but she also was bafflingly stupid and ungrateful for believing her mother was the main enemy in the film. The unfortunate incident of the mother's murder would not have happened at all had Juliet not entered Pauline's life and poisoned it with deluded thoughts about the Fourth World. If Pauline is misguided, Juliet is the main cause for leading her buddy astray. I really don't know how to take the fact that this same Juliet is a best-selling author now, because the movie unflatteringly portrays her as a cankerous albeit intelligent mind who thinks 'scars are romantic'. Pauline meanwhile leads a reclusive life at a school, ashamed of her dark and twisted past and seeking redemption possibly by nurturing school children to be unlike what she had been. The sensational murder case of Honora Parker by her own daughter Pauline and her best friend (and lover probably) Juliet Hulme is brought to screen in a fascinating and unorthodox fashion by auteur director- scriptwriter Peter Jackson. Though not as talked about as cases like Black Dahlia or the Moors Murders, the 1954 murder case is still a very intriguing one for the plain reason that it was hard to fathom that two very intelligent girls could turn into cold-blooded murderers of one's own mother. Also to be considered is the relationship between the two girls who are seemingly lesbians yet it cannot be entirely confirmed as they do not show much attraction towards other girls. The diaries written by Pauline refer to the girls' communion with 'saints' in the Fourth world who are mostly made of actors like Orson Welles, and thus act as a major source material for the film and another reason for raising curiosity about the case. Peter Jackson is not one to keep it straight; much like David Lynch he has his directorial mark etched all over the film. Heavenly Angels does not start with court proceedings, and neither does it show the arrest of the two girls. It lets us enter and experience the 'mental music' of the girls themselves rather than presenting its events informally through banal court sessions. Jackson's transition from Braindead to Heavenly Children and following transition to Lord of the Rings is clearly visible in Heavenly Children, which seems to possess both the stylistic characteristics of the preceding and succeeding films. Not only do the characters give slightly mannered performances that recalls the over- the-top acting in Braindead (such as a scene in the first quarter where Pauline's father holds a fish in his hands and pretends to sing while the record of Mario Lanza plays on), but certain characters also give us impressions of characters from Braindead (especially the timid boarders at Pauline's home who are quite similar to Braindead's male protagonist). On the other hand, Juliet dressed as a princess chasing Pauline, with white horses in the background may recall magical sequences from LOTR series; I may be wrong in saying this since I have not seen the Lord of the Ring series. There are a number of brilliantly choreographed sequences, especially the montage showing Pauline's and Juliet's happy days together, lightened with Mario Lanza's arresting music. Some involve lighthearted humor that nevertheless act as a presage for the girls' worsening behavior, such as the hilarious scene at the hospital where Juliet is approached by a middle-aged man who rambles about Christ and placing faith in Christianity and is ultimately beheaded albeit in Juliet's mind by one of the saints. The most unnerving part is reserved for the end where the characters the camera movements slow down and silence becomes more pronounced, with only a background score playing solemnly as we brace ourselves to watch that dreadful part. Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in each and every scene; apart from one scene involving the girls discussing about each others' scars where she sounds too crazy, she successfully makes Juliet a highly mentally fragile female whose attachment to her fantasy life and Fourth World acts as a catalyst for the disruption of the lives of the two families. She also excellently plays the brutal murder scene, rightly giving the 'should-we-really-do-this' look to Juliet. But Melanie is the true star here, doing a great job performing the difficult role of Pauline. Not only do her expressions, her lack of eye contact and her defensive sitting posture accurately portray the role she is playing of a socially awkward teenager, but Lyndskey also gives her character Pauline a unique manner of smiling where her nose crinkles up as she smiles. And both actresses play their characters with damn seriousness even during the hallucination sequences, which is a tough job for such a young pair of ladies. Also, Sarah Peirse is terrific in her slightly straightforward role as the mother who is the only one taking an effort to understand what's wrong with her daughter. I unfortunately do not have the unrated version of the movie which is slightly longer but would have nevertheless remained useful because I've read it contains scenes involving Juliet's mother's affair with one of the patients. 'Heavenly' Recommended.

    We all know Peter Jackson as the man who directed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: but his early days as a director of horror-comedies. His 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures, based on a real-life murder, was his first step away from that genre and show what else he was capable of. In 1952 Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) is a social outsider who does not get on well with her peers at her school in Christchuch, New Zealand. But at the start of the new term she befriends a new student, English girl Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet). Both had childhood illnesses and they bond through their imagination, their creation of a fantasy world and have a love of music, particularly Mario Lanza. But their friendship slowly turns to obsession with each other, becoming extremely close, they find it hard to separate fantasy from reality and their fantasies become more and more violent. Mixed with their personal troubles their parents try to separate them, resulting with them planning a murder. Heavenly Creatures is a wonderfully made film and it was very Kubrickian in its approach. The lighting and use of shadows, colours and camera movement made the film look very much like Stanley Kubrick film and this was the type of story that would interested the man. The use of narrator also felt very similar to how Kubrick would let us know the thoughts of our main character. This film does have a great feeling of being like A Clockwork Orange, Lolita and The Shining, even though they are different films. We got the suburban setting of Lolita, the out of control youths from A Clockwork Orange and the theme of insanity and fantasy from The Shinning. On the wider front of Jackson's direction it was faultless. The pacing was perfect (I watched the 95 minute cut), the special effects were great for the time (this was Weta's first film) and it blended well with the film. Despite the low budget the special effects worked well and shifted between light and upbeat to dark and creepy. There are excellent camera moments and editing trick to shift us from the world of reality to fantasy and it was fitting for the situation as the girls were loosing their minds or using their imagination to enact violence fantasies. There are a lot of themes and ideas being explored in Heavenly Creatures. The most obvious are obsession, insanity and mental health, the parent-child relationship and friendship, even if the result is detrimental. But there are other themes about adolescence, about how it was changing and there was little understand of this period. We see how adolescence is a period of transition, from the two girls having fantasies which turn darker and they start to embark on more adult ventures, even at their young age, but also making them vulnerable to being exploited. There is a lack of understanding and this was film was set in a period where we are children or adults and no in-between. There is a clique of attitudes and psychology of the period as well a look at differing of parenting approaches. Heavenly Creatures was the first film for Winslet and Lynskey and there were of course there excellent in their roles, playing two hardly complex, troubled girls. Both are very bright and imaginative and you can easily believe in their friendship and relationship and how unusually close they are. The adult actors too were very strong throughout and there were no weak links in a film about two teenage girls taking a very dark turn. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan then you need see Heavenly Creatures. Other wises Heavenly Creatures is worthy film both as a piece of dramatic storytelling, visual filmmaking and a thematic piece about obsessions and unhealthy relationships.

    Pauline(Melanie) is a loner at school. She becomes friends with Juliet(Kate Winslet in her debut role) who is the new girl in class. They spend a lot of time together. Winslet is writing a fantasy book and both begin to live the book. Their parents are not pleased with their proximity and decide to separate them. The girls have their own plan to get back at their parents. Superbly directed by Peter Jackson, this is based on events which occurred in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand in 1953 and 54. The acting by both the leads is excellent. The fantasy scenes are created brilliantly and the characters of the two sets of parents are given quality screen time. This is a must watch for the fans of true crime and good drama and acting. 3.5 out of 5.

    After directing his blood and gore splatter epics: Bad Taste, Meet The Feebles, and Braindead; Peter Jackson directed his very first mainstream film, long before his own adaption trilogy of The Lord of The Rings. "Heavenly Creatures" tells the story about Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juilet (Played by "Titanic" fame, Kate Winslet.), and how their homosexual relationship ends tragically after a murder escapade. It's all based on a true New Zealand story, which seems very odd, as a selection of scenes from the film are fantasy. There are many good reasons why this film is worth watching. The visuals are amazing, the emotion is strong and powerful, and the innocence and beauty of the main characters defines the film's title. I quite enjoyed Heavenly Creatures, and I can recommend it for those who like Peter Jackson's other films. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    Heavenly Creatures is one of the most fascinating films I've seen in a long time. The story is unique, to say the least. It's the true story of two girls, Pauline Parker(Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme(Kate Winslet) who have an unusual, obsessive relationship to the point where they're rumored to be lesbian and get broken up by their parents, enraged they decide to get back at them. What's interesting to me about this movie is how ambiguous it is. There's very little that actually gets explained directly to the audience. Sure, the logical reason they killed Parker's mother is because they didn't want to be broken up but their psychological reasonings are never really explained. In fact, this is one of the hardest reviews for me to write because it's so unique and open to interpretation but I'll try my best. I think the question this movie is trying to raise is should you listen to what society says or should you be who you really are. We don't see every bit of their lives but I assume that these girls prior meeting each other were social outcasts and loners and in a way, these girls were made for each other. They bond with each other extremely well because they're both highly imaginative, curious girls who have never been allowed to show who they really were because of the rules society had back then for how girls should behave. So when they hang out together, it's like they are freeing themselves of society's rules and entering their own world of storytelling, Mario Lanza(a tenor they idolize), and imagination. But their bond may have been too strong for each other because there was very few girls like them so they end up obsessing over one another to the point where the parents feel this relationship is unhealthy and decide to split them. But the film never really tells us whether or not, these parents are doing the right thing. It's all up to the viewer. Later on, the girls start planning out their murder and when it happens, it's one of the most disturbing murders ever filmed in my opinion. It isn't disturbing just because of how violent it is but more so because of how personal this murder is. They didn't do it to some stranger for money, they did it to someone they knew for a long time out of anger and frustration! And there's a moment where you see how Parker really regrets going with this decision, when she first strikes her mother with the brick, she starts tearing up. I read somewhere she didn't shed a tear in real life but that was a brilliant decision on Jackson's part as director and it adds a lot of nuance to her character. I think Jackson's directing feels a little too artsy in some scenes. He made this after making low-budget horror-comedy films like Bad Taste and Braindead and I think with this film, he was really trying to establish himself as a serious dramatic director but some scenes do feel unnecessarily artsy. But the thing the movie gets perfect is the two girls. Not only are they acted excellently, but they have a lot of dimension. It could have been easy for Jackson just to make them misunderstood, innocent people and while they seem to be like that in the first half, they also are portrayed as extremely sensitive and perhaps maybe a little mad. But once again, the film doesn't tell us how to feel about them, it lets us decide on our own. Another thing I appreciate is the camera-work. Sam Raimi's been listed on Wikipedia as one of his influences in filmmaking and it shows here because of the way he shoots his scenes and it looks excellent. Sadly though, his later films had abandoned this style of camera-work. Overall, while Jackson's direction can seem a little too artsy at times, the film is wonderfully-acted, well-shot, and beautifully ambiguous so I'm gonna give it a 8/10.

    the story was so basic yet so utter, so real yet so celestial, inhuman yet so human. the surface of my skin, all over body, roused and shuddered in solidarity as the play reached its final.../ it was the stretched reaction of the skin, towards the transcending sprite trying to "liberate" and "violate" the imposed limits of my self-space. I was left with two hands locked in each other, streams of tears in the eyes, echoing screams of the two in the ear... and plainly pinned to the black screen as the final credits were rolling. review on this film should not be polluted with words of speculation or expression, and I don't intend to go further. I have just one stand to present : This Film Should Merely "Be Seen".... Merely "Be Seen".... PS: I write these lines right after watching the movie, because as deductive, destructive polluting brain that i possess, i know i'm gonna compartmentalize the whole experience, movie, characters, and every element of it, during next few days...But for now...just for tonight,and since a long time... i'm gonna allow myself to turn off the top floor of my anatomy, and feel it with all cells of my flesh, as long as i can, as slowly as i can, this artistic drama that without notice, has been slipped into the mouth.. Do yourself a favor and don't ask or seek, just see!

    Heavenly Creatures is probably the most mature film Peter Jackson has ever made. It perfectly shows what his capable as director, storyteller and what he is missing nowadays - good editor. Peter Jackson has something that many directors lack nowadays - experience at making low-budget schlock. Making B-movies is the best way to learn your craft as a filmmaker and most importantly working with limited budgets, actors, visual effects and editing. And the end result is quite wonderful - we have a director who can tackle strange stories, makes a great use of visuals and is not afraid of getting gritty and brutal. Heavenly Creatures looks and feels like a Peter Jackson film. There are his signature camera movement, strange and over the top performances and his signature bizarre visuals. It never feels like a realistic because of the way it's shot and acted since the story is very demented, dark and tragic in it's nature. The performances are all over the place and quite goofy most of the time. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey provide the central performances of the film and they are absolutely great in a demented sort of way. The only problem is the fact that look slightly older than they are supposed to be which can be distracting at times. The supporting cast is as over the top and loony as you can get but it perfectly fits the vision of the film. The only real problem I had with Heavenly Creatures was the ending. It felt rushed and somewhat poorly done. Most of these film that are based on true events, end fairly abruptly and feature a lame text crawl. It's a clich&eacute; that needs to stop because feature films need a rock solid conclusion not some abrupt ending. A Man Who was Superman had wonderful ending despite the fact it was based on true story... Despite it's lame ending, Heavenly Creatures is a wonderful film that showcases the strangest mainstream director of our time moving from gory B-movies to serious art-house cinema. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan, Kate Winslet fan or just a fan of interesting films, Heavenly Creatures is a must see.

    It was hard to believe that horror specialist Jackson, who's Braindead is one of the goriest movies ever delivered, could make a movie that is so lovely, sweet en gorgeous as Heavenly Creatures. Now he is one of the greatest directors who's working now because of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the remake of King Kong and The Hobbit. For me this was the beginning of a great director's life. Two girls, the uncertain Lynskey and the 'wild' Winslet, live in the 50s in the conservative New Zealand and have a close friendship. To close, or so their parents say. They fear that their daughters are lesbians. The two lose themselves completely in their together fantasized medieval fantasy world. When they threaten to be torn away from each other, Lynskey gets the plan to murder her mother, with disastrous consequences. The two young, debuting actresses deliver great performances, and are helped by a strong adult cast. In Venice awarded a Golden Lion and the screenplay by Jackson and Frances Walsh was nominated for an Oscar. Three years later, Winslet would become world famous by her role in the blockbuster Titanic. Great drama, great effects, great acting and great but sad story.

    Pauline Parker is a misguided adolescent. She is blinded by the belief that her best buddy Juliet Hulme's family is the ideal one where she belongs. Her foolish ignorance of the love, care and affection given by her own middle-class parents can be especially found when she does not consider the fact that it is her mother who always takes notice of her feeling and tries talking to her, like when Pauline is sad about Juliet contacting tuberculosis or when she is sitting in one corner away from the rest of her family. Pauline's vivid imagination also innocently made Dr. Henry Hulme (Juliet's dad) a hero, when in reality he was a major cause for the separation of the two girls. She may have a wider knowledge and a greater imagination than her mother, but she also was bafflingly stupid and ungrateful for believing her mother was the main enemy in the film. The unfortunate incident of the mother's murder would not have happened at all had Juliet not entered Pauline's life and poisoned it with deluded thoughts about the Fourth World. If Pauline is misguided, Juliet is the main cause for leading her buddy astray. I really don't know how to take the fact that this same Juliet is a best-selling author now, because the movie unflatteringly portrays her as a cankerous albeit intelligent mind who thinks 'scars are romantic'. Pauline meanwhile leads a reclusive life at a school, ashamed of her dark and twisted past and seeking redemption possibly by nurturing school children to be unlike what she had been. The sensational murder case of Honora Parker by her own daughter Pauline and her best friend (and lover probably) Juliet Hulme is brought to screen in a fascinating and unorthodox fashion by auteur director- scriptwriter Peter Jackson. Though not as talked about as cases like Black Dahlia or the Moors Murders, the 1954 murder case is still a very intriguing one for the plain reason that it was hard to fathom that two very intelligent girls could turn into cold-blooded murderers of one's own mother. Also to be considered is the relationship between the two girls who are seemingly lesbians yet it cannot be entirely confirmed as they do not show much attraction towards other girls. The diaries written by Pauline refer to the girls' communion with 'saints' in the Fourth world who are mostly made of actors like Orson Welles, and thus act as a major source material for the film and another reason for raising curiosity about the case. Peter Jackson is not one to keep it straight; much like David Lynch he has his directorial mark etched all over the film. Heavenly Angels does not start with court proceedings, and neither does it show the arrest of the two girls. It lets us enter and experience the 'mental music' of the girls themselves rather than presenting its events informally through banal court sessions. Jackson's transition from Braindead to Heavenly Children and following transition to Lord of the Rings is clearly visible in Heavenly Children, which seems to possess both the stylistic characteristics of the preceding and succeeding films. Not only do the characters give slightly mannered performances that recalls the over- the-top acting in Braindead (such as a scene in the first quarter where Pauline's father holds a fish in his hands and pretends to sing while the record of Mario Lanza plays on), but certain characters also give us impressions of characters from Braindead (especially the timid boarders at Pauline's home who are quite similar to Braindead's male protagonist). On the other hand, Juliet dressed as a princess chasing Pauline, with white horses in the background may recall magical sequences from LOTR series; I may be wrong in saying this since I have not seen the Lord of the Ring series. There are a number of brilliantly choreographed sequences, especially the montage showing Pauline's and Juliet's happy days together, lightened with Mario Lanza's arresting music. Some involve lighthearted humor that nevertheless act as a presage for the girls' worsening behavior, such as the hilarious scene at the hospital where Juliet is approached by a middle-aged man who rambles about Christ and placing faith in Christianity and is ultimately beheaded albeit in Juliet's mind by one of the saints. The most unnerving part is reserved for the end where the characters the camera movements slow down and silence becomes more pronounced, with only a background score playing solemnly as we brace ourselves to watch that dreadful part. Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in each and every scene; apart from one scene involving the girls discussing about each others' scars where she sounds too crazy, she successfully makes Juliet a highly mentally fragile female whose attachment to her fantasy life and Fourth World acts as a catalyst for the disruption of the lives of the two families. She also excellently plays the brutal murder scene, rightly giving the 'should-we-really-do-this' look to Juliet. But Melanie is the true star here, doing a great job performing the difficult role of Pauline. Not only do her expressions, her lack of eye contact and her defensive sitting posture accurately portray the role she is playing of a socially awkward teenager, but Lyndskey also gives her character Pauline a unique manner of smiling where her nose crinkles up as she smiles. And both actresses play their characters with damn seriousness even during the hallucination sequences, which is a tough job for such a young pair of ladies. Also, Sarah Peirse is terrific in her slightly straightforward role as the mother who is the only one taking an effort to understand what's wrong with her daughter. I unfortunately do not have the unrated version of the movie which is slightly longer but would have nevertheless remained useful because I've read it contains scenes involving Juliet's mother's affair with one of the patients. 'Heavenly' Recommended.

    We all know Peter Jackson as the man who directed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: but his early days as a director of horror-comedies. His 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures, based on a real-life murder, was his first step away from that genre and show what else he was capable of. In 1952 Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) is a social outsider who does not get on well with her peers at her school in Christchuch, New Zealand. But at the start of the new term she befriends a new student, English girl Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet). Both had childhood illnesses and they bond through their imagination, their creation of a fantasy world and have a love of music, particularly Mario Lanza. But their friendship slowly turns to obsession with each other, becoming extremely close, they find it hard to separate fantasy from reality and their fantasies become more and more violent. Mixed with their personal troubles their parents try to separate them, resulting with them planning a murder. Heavenly Creatures is a wonderfully made film and it was very Kubrickian in its approach. The lighting and use of shadows, colours and camera movement made the film look very much like Stanley Kubrick film and this was the type of story that would interested the man. The use of narrator also felt very similar to how Kubrick would let us know the thoughts of our main character. This film does have a great feeling of being like A Clockwork Orange, Lolita and The Shining, even though they are different films. We got the suburban setting of Lolita, the out of control youths from A Clockwork Orange and the theme of insanity and fantasy from The Shinning. On the wider front of Jackson's direction it was faultless. The pacing was perfect (I watched the 95 minute cut), the special effects were great for the time (this was Weta's first film) and it blended well with the film. Despite the low budget the special effects worked well and shifted between light and upbeat to dark and creepy. There are excellent camera moments and editing trick to shift us from the world of reality to fantasy and it was fitting for the situation as the girls were loosing their minds or using their imagination to enact violence fantasies. There are a lot of themes and ideas being explored in Heavenly Creatures. The most obvious are obsession, insanity and mental health, the parent-child relationship and friendship, even if the result is detrimental. But there are other themes about adolescence, about how it was changing and there was little understand of this period. We see how adolescence is a period of transition, from the two girls having fantasies which turn darker and they start to embark on more adult ventures, even at their young age, but also making them vulnerable to being exploited. There is a lack of understanding and this was film was set in a period where we are children or adults and no in-between. There is a clique of attitudes and psychology of the period as well a look at differing of parenting approaches. Heavenly Creatures was the first film for Winslet and Lynskey and there were of course there excellent in their roles, playing two hardly complex, troubled girls. Both are very bright and imaginative and you can easily believe in their friendship and relationship and how unusually close they are. The adult actors too were very strong throughout and there were no weak links in a film about two teenage girls taking a very dark turn. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan then you need see Heavenly Creatures. Other wises Heavenly Creatures is worthy film both as a piece of dramatic storytelling, visual filmmaking and a thematic piece about obsessions and unhealthy relationships.

    Pauline(Melanie) is a loner at school. She becomes friends with Juliet(Kate Winslet in her debut role) who is the new girl in class. They spend a lot of time together. Winslet is writing a fantasy book and both begin to live the book. Their parents are not pleased with their proximity and decide to separate them. The girls have their own plan to get back at their parents. Superbly directed by Peter Jackson, this is based on events which occurred in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand in 1953 and 54. The acting by both the leads is excellent. The fantasy scenes are created brilliantly and the characters of the two sets of parents are given quality screen time. This is a must watch for the fans of true crime and good drama and acting. 3.5 out of 5.

    After directing his blood and gore splatter epics: Bad Taste, Meet The Feebles, and Braindead; Peter Jackson directed his very first mainstream film, long before his own adaption trilogy of The Lord of The Rings. "Heavenly Creatures" tells the story about Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juilet (Played by "Titanic" fame, Kate Winslet.), and how their homosexual relationship ends tragically after a murder escapade. It's all based on a true New Zealand story, which seems very odd, as a selection of scenes from the film are fantasy. There are many good reasons why this film is worth watching. The visuals are amazing, the emotion is strong and powerful, and the innocence and beauty of the main characters defines the film's title. I quite enjoyed Heavenly Creatures, and I can recommend it for those who like Peter Jackson's other films. 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    Heavenly Creatures is one of the most fascinating films I've seen in a long time. The story is unique, to say the least. It's the true story of two girls, Pauline Parker(Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme(Kate Winslet) who have an unusual, obsessive relationship to the point where they're rumored to be lesbian and get broken up by their parents, enraged they decide to get back at them. What's interesting to me about this movie is how ambiguous it is. There's very little that actually gets explained directly to the audience. Sure, the logical reason they killed Parker's mother is because they didn't want to be broken up but their psychological reasonings are never really explained. In fact, this is one of the hardest reviews for me to write because it's so unique and open to interpretation but I'll try my best. I think the question this movie is trying to raise is should you listen to what society says or should you be who you really are. We don't see every bit of their lives but I assume that these girls prior meeting each other were social outcasts and loners and in a way, these girls were made for each other. They bond with each other extremely well because they're both highly imaginative, curious girls who have never been allowed to show who they really were because of the rules society had back then for how girls should behave. So when they hang out together, it's like they are freeing themselves of society's rules and entering their own world of storytelling, Mario Lanza(a tenor they idolize), and imagination. But their bond may have been too strong for each other because there was very few girls like them so they end up obsessing over one another to the point where the parents feel this relationship is unhealthy and decide to split them. But the film never really tells us whether or not, these parents are doing the right thing. It's all up to the viewer. Later on, the girls start planning out their murder and when it happens, it's one of the most disturbing murders ever filmed in my opinion. It isn't disturbing just because of how violent it is but more so because of how personal this murder is. They didn't do it to some stranger for money, they did it to someone they knew for a long time out of anger and frustration! And there's a moment where you see how Parker really regrets going with this decision, when she first strikes her mother with the brick, she starts tearing up. I read somewhere she didn't shed a tear in real life but that was a brilliant decision on Jackson's part as director and it adds a lot of nuance to her character. I think Jackson's directing feels a little too artsy in some scenes. He made this after making low-budget horror-comedy films like Bad Taste and Braindead and I think with this film, he was really trying to establish himself as a serious dramatic director but some scenes do feel unnecessarily artsy. But the thing the movie gets perfect is the two girls. Not only are they acted excellently, but they have a lot of dimension. It could have been easy for Jackson just to make them misunderstood, innocent people and while they seem to be like that in the first half, they also are portrayed as extremely sensitive and perhaps maybe a little mad. But once again, the film doesn't tell us how to feel about them, it lets us decide on our own. Another thing I appreciate is the camera-work. Sam Raimi's been listed on Wikipedia as one of his influences in filmmaking and it shows here because of the way he shoots his scenes and it looks excellent. Sadly though, his later films had abandoned this style of camera-work. Overall, while Jackson's direction can seem a little too artsy at times, the film is wonderfully-acted, well-shot, and beautifully ambiguous so I'm gonna give it a 8/10.

    the story was so basic yet so utter, so real yet so celestial, inhuman yet so human. the surface of my skin, all over body, roused and shuddered in solidarity as the play reached its final.../ it was the stretched reaction of the skin, towards the transcending sprite trying to "liberate" and "violate" the imposed limits of my self-space. I was left with two hands locked in each other, streams of tears in the eyes, echoing screams of the two in the ear... and plainly pinned to the black screen as the final credits were rolling. review on this film should not be polluted with words of speculation or expression, and I don't intend to go further. I have just one stand to present : This Film Should Merely "Be Seen".... Merely "Be Seen".... PS: I write these lines right after watching the movie, because as deductive, destructive polluting brain that i possess, i know i'm gonna compartmentalize the whole experience, movie, characters, and every element of it, during next few days...But for now...just for tonight,and since a long time... i'm gonna allow myself to turn off the top floor of my anatomy, and feel it with all cells of my flesh, as long as i can, as slowly as i can, this artistic drama that without notice, has been slipped into the mouth.. Do yourself a favor and don't ask or seek, just see!

    Heavenly Creatures is probably the most mature film Peter Jackson has ever made. It perfectly shows what his capable as director, storyteller and what he is missing nowadays - good editor. Peter Jackson has something that many directors lack nowadays - experience at making low-budget schlock. Making B-movies is the best way to learn your craft as a filmmaker and most importantly working with limited budgets, actors, visual effects and editing. And the end result is quite wonderful - we have a director who can tackle strange stories, makes a great use of visuals and is not afraid of getting gritty and brutal. Heavenly Creatures looks and feels like a Peter Jackson film. There are his signature camera movement, strange and over the top performances and his signature bizarre visuals. It never feels like a realistic because of the way it's shot and acted since the story is very demented, dark and tragic in it's nature. The performances are all over the place and quite goofy most of the time. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey provide the central performances of the film and they are absolutely great in a demented sort of way. The only problem is the fact that look slightly older than they are supposed to be which can be distracting at times. The supporting cast is as over the top and loony as you can get but it perfectly fits the vision of the film. The only real problem I had with Heavenly Creatures was the ending. It felt rushed and somewhat poorly done. Most of these film that are based on true events, end fairly abruptly and feature a lame text crawl. It's a clich&eacute; that needs to stop because feature films need a rock solid conclusion not some abrupt ending. A Man Who was Superman had wonderful ending despite the fact it was based on true story... Despite it's lame ending, Heavenly Creatures is a wonderful film that showcases the strangest mainstream director of our time moving from gory B-movies to serious art-house cinema. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan, Kate Winslet fan or just a fan of interesting films, Heavenly Creatures is a must see.

    New Zealand screenwriter, producer and director Peter Jackson's fourth feature film which he co-wrote with New Zealand screenwriter, producer and lyricist Frances Walsh and co-produced, is inspired by the Parker-Hulme murder case from 1954 which took place in Christchurch on the South Island of New Zealand where the film was shot. It premiered In competition at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994 and is a New Zealand production which was produced by New Zealand producer Jim Booth (1945-1994). It tells the story about two 15-year-old students named Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme who meets at a girls' secondary school in Christchurch during a summer in the early 1950s. Pauline and Juliet becomes best friends and creates their own secluded imaginary world, but when their parents begins worrying about their behavior and the nature of their relationship, they try to separate them. Distinctly and finely directed by New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson, this rhythmic, biographical and fictional story which is narrated by and from the two female protagonists viewpoints, draws a distinct portrayal of a malicious and unruly friendship between two aspiring writers. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by New Zealand production designer Grant Major, cinematography by New Zealand cinematographer Alun Bollinger and fine costume design by New Zealand costume designer Ngila Dickson and use of sound, this character-driven, narrative-driven and fairy-tale-like psychological thriller depicts two interrelated and in-depth studies of character and contains a great score by New Zealand composer Peter Dasent. This darkly humorous, significantly atmospheric and remarkable coming-of-age indie from the early 1990s which is set during a summer in 1954 in a city in New Zealand, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, eccentric characters, fine editing by New Zealand film editor Jamie Selkirk and the prominent and brilliant acting performances by New Zealand actress Melanie Lynskey, English actress Kate Winslet and the fine supporting acting performance by New Zealand actress Sarah Pierse. A surreal, sensual, inventive and wickedly romantic crime drama which gained, among numerous other awards, the Silver Lion Peter Jackson at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994.

    I came into the movie at the halfway mark and watched the rest from there, something entirely out of character for me but I knew Peter Jackson had directed this and I wanted to see what it was about. (I didn't know anything about the back story or that it was real.) I haven't seen everything he's done but it looked like he was diving into a completely different kind of subject matter than some of his movies, so I gave it a shot. In all honesty, I hate movies like this. Head trippy, psychological thrillers do nothing for me. In fact, I was going in a completely different direction for a while. I kept laughing, inappropriately as it turns out. The main girl's expression was so ridiculous and funny, and that hair...lumbering around like Bigfoot...she looked like a female version of Peter lol. But I was soon to find out all these tidbits of levity were not important to the story. Predictably, it turns into a love story because that's what a lot of teenagers do, they experiment and fall in love at the drop of a hat. So now that we're supposed to believe that they're in love, of which I never do (it doesn't come across as anything other than horny teenagers having sex), their desperation combined with their insanity turns deadly. Now I've gone from laughing at some silly scenes to somehow believing these girls are capable of bludgeoning someone to death and not just someone, her own mother. I'm sorry, but nothing in this movie convinced me of the events that could lead up to this. It almost seems like the filmmakers were glorifying this event rather than chronicling it. I just don't see real hate. I don't see real love. I don't see real anguish, except by Kate Winslet who seems to be upset by the littlest of things. Perhaps watching the entire movie would shed more light but having seen what I've seen I don't think it would change my opinion of it. Frankly, I'm glad I didn't pay any money for this. I'm not saying it's wholly bad, if you like psychological thrillers, go for it. Psych. thrillers in general don't make any sense but you're supposed to allow yourself to go along with the ride, no matter how silly or unbelievable it gets, so if that's what you like, you should be good here. I applaud Peter for attempting such a subject matter, especially since it's a true story. But I really don't think we need any more first-person accounts of real-life murders anymore. There wasn't anything beautiful about this story. That would be like saying the Lizzie Borden murders were beautiful. No, this is just sad and should have been portrayed in an appropriate way, if nothing else, for the families. Plus, it would have been great for those of us who weren't rooting for them to see those witches for what they really are and not try to get us to feel sorry for them.

    It was hard to believe that horror specialist Jackson, who's Braindead is one of the goriest movies ever delivered, could make a movie that is so lovely, sweet en gorgeous as Heavenly Creatures. Now he is one of the greatest directors who's working now because of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the remake of King Kong and The Hobbit. For me this was the beginning of a great director's life. Two girls, the uncertain Lynskey and the 'wild' Winslet, live in the 50s in the conservative New Zealand and have a close friendship. To close, or so their parents say. They fear that their daughters are lesbians. The two lose themselves completely in their together fantasized medieval fantasy world. When they threaten to be torn away from each other, Lynskey gets the plan to murder her mother, with disastrous consequences. The two young, debuting actresses deliver great performances, and are helped by a strong adult cast. In Venice awarded a Golden Lion and the screenplay by Jackson and Frances Walsh was nominated for an Oscar. Three years later, Winslet would become world famous by her role in the blockbuster Titanic. Great drama, great effects, great acting and great but sad story.

She also excellently plays the brutal murder scene, rightly giving the 'should-we-really-do-this' look to Juliet. But Melanie is the true star here, doing a great job performing the difficult role of Pauline. Not only do her expressions, her lack of eye contact and her defensive sitting posture accurately portray the role she is playing of a socially awkward teenager, but Lyndskey also gives her character Pauline a unique manner of smiling where her nose crinkles up as she smiles. And both actresses play their characters with damn seriousness even during the hallucination sequences, which is a tough job for such a young pair of ladies. Also, Sarah Peirse is terrific in her slightly straightforward role as the mother who is the only one taking an effort to understand what's wrong with her daughter. I unfortunately do not have the unrated version of the movie which is slightly longer but would have nevertheless remained useful because I've read it contains scenes involving Juliet's mother's affair with one of the patients.

    We all know Peter Jackson as the man who directed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: but his early days as a director of horror-comedies. His 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures, based on a real-life murder, was his first step away from that genre and show what else he was capable of. In 1952 Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) is a social outsider who does not get on well with her peers at her school in Christchuch, New Zealand. But at the start of the new term she befriends a new student, English girl Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet). Both had childhood illnesses and they bond through their imagination, their creation of a fantasy world and have a love of music, particularly Mario Lanza. But their friendship slowly turns to obsession with each other, becoming extremely close, they find it hard to separate fantasy from reality and their fantasies become more and more violent. Mixed with their personal troubles their parents try to separate them, resulting with them planning a murder. Heavenly Creatures is a wonderfully made film and it was very Kubrickian in its approach. The lighting and use of shadows, colours and camera movement made the film look very much like Stanley Kubrick film and this was the type of story that would interested the man. The use of narrator also felt very similar to how Kubrick would let us know the thoughts of our main character. This film does have a great feeling of being like A Clockwork Orange, Lolita and The Shining, even though they are different films. We got the suburban setting of Lolita, the out of control youths from A Clockwork Orange and the theme of insanity and fantasy from The Shinning. On the wider front of Jackson's direction it was faultless. The pacing was perfect (I watched the 95 minute cut), the special effects were great for the time (this was Weta's first film) and it blended well with the film. Despite the low budget the special effects worked well and shifted between light and upbeat to dark and creepy. There are excellent camera moments and editing trick to shift us from the world of reality to fantasy and it was fitting for the situation as the girls were loosing their minds or using their imagination to enact violence fantasies. There are a lot of themes and ideas being explored in Heavenly Creatures. The most obvious are obsession, insanity and mental health, the parent-child relationship and friendship, even if the result is detrimental. But there are other themes about adolescence, about how it was changing and there was little understand of this period. We see how adolescence is a period of transition, from the two girls having fantasies which turn darker and they start to embark on more adult ventures, even at their young age, but also making them vulnerable to being exploited. There is a lack of understanding and this was film was set in a period where we are children or adults and no in-between. There is a clique of attitudes and psychology of the period as well a look at differing of parenting approaches. Heavenly Creatures was the first film for Winslet and Lynskey and there were of course there excellent in their roles, playing two hardly complex, troubled girls. Both are very bright and imaginative and you can easily believe in their friendship and relationship and how unusually close they are. The adult actors too were very strong throughout and there were no weak links in a film about two teenage girls taking a very dark turn. If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan then you need see Heavenly Creatures. Other wises Heavenly Creatures is worthy film both as a piece of dramatic storytelling, visual filmmaking and a thematic piece about obsessions and unhealthy relationships.

    Pauline(Melanie) is a loner at school. She becomes friends with Juliet(Kate Winslet in her debut role) who is the new girl in class. They spend a lot of time together. Winslet is writing a fantasy book and both begin to live the book. Their parents are not pleased with their proximity and decide to separate them. The girls have their own plan to get back at their parents. Superbly directed by Peter Jackson, this is based on events which occurred in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand in 1953 and 54. The acting by both the leads is excellent. The fantasy scenes are created brilliantly and the characters of the two sets of parents are given quality screen time. This is a must watch for the fans of true crime and good drama and acting. 3.5 out of 5.
