 <sinopse>
  A surgeon becomes obsessed with the seductive woman he once had an affair with. Refusing to accept that she has moved on, he amputates her limbs and holds her captive in his mansion.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A top surgeon is besotted with a beautiful woman who once ditched him. Unable to come to terms with life without her, he tries to convince her that they need each other. She has other ideas, but an horrific accident leaves her at his mercy. The plot is bizarre and perhaps sick at times, ending abruptly and with a twist.

    At it's core, the idea of Boxing Helena is interesting and pretty darn twisted. Knowing about it before hand was the only thing that kept me watching. It's a brave and unique premise for a movie. But it doesn't ever get good. Or shocking. From the get go the doctor comes off as odd and a little creepy. (And for some reason he's applying ear medicine and has cotton stuffed in his ear the whole movie. Why? I couldn't tell you.) His obsession with the (Needlessly?) bitchy Helena is questionable and for some reason there are scattered allusions to some kind of tainted past with his mother. About 45 minutes in, if he hadn't been set up to be so obvious, there could have been a real shock reveal when we find out what he's been up to. This movie tries, for some reason, to scatter erotica around too. There's a far too long slow motion scene where Helena gets undressed and jumps in a fountain at a party. You know, like you do. A scene from nowhere, where Dr. Nick has sex with a completely random and nameless woman to entertain Helena, who apparently reaches some kind of climax by watching this despite the fact that at this point in the movie, she can't possibly do that by herself. To top it all off it ends with - I'm not kidding you - "Oh, it was all a dream." DO NOT waste two hours on this flick, even if the plot sounds as intriguing to you as it did to me. It's a perfect example of how a good idea can be executed incredibly poorly.

    Personally i love the movie & for those lucky people that live in Atlanta or Georgia, Can see the Nick Cavanaugh Mansion which it states on here that it is Lullwater Road, Druid Hills which is wrong. The Correct Address is 3467 Castlegate DR,NW,Atlanta,GA. Sherilyn Fenn Looks Fantastic as Helena & in my opinion her best performance to date as i have seen 22 of her movies. Nick Cavanaugh is a Brilliant Atlanta Surgeon who seems to be Sexually Repressed, & one night meets the Sexy Helena & has a one night stand & falls in love with her & becomes Obsessed by her & everything she stands for. After the Death of his Mother Nick decides to keep the family mansion & throws a house warming party on the chance Helena will arrive & she does not caring for his hospitality. Once she has freshen up in his fountain she goes with one of Nicks Party Guests a fellow Surgeon for a one night stand & leaves her address book. She asks nick to bring her address book to the airport as he tricks her by coming late & so she comes to his mansion to collect, as Nick plays games with her wanting to eat & drink with her she then storms out & gets knock over by a car. Nick then has her captive in his House & amputates her injured leg & gradually finishes the job off by removing both arms & legs as a statue of sexual desire. By then belonging to him & so gradually she becomes dependant on him. A Brilliant film which does'nt get the credit it deserves the story may be daft but the point the director gets across is brilliantly shot with the fantasy dream visions of his mum is fantastic. I would love to see the movie remade.

    Close. Real close. "Boxing Helena" was so close of being good, so close of being an fine and greatly elaborated movie which flies high imagination and weirdness, with pivotal elements of a twisted cult movie. Directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch, daughter of the great David Lynch, "Boxing..." can be very enjoyable, an guilty pleasure to some or even an masterpiece to a few. To me, it was quite good until I realize it was going nowhere, completely problematic and when her speech started to fade away into a nebulous emptiness the movie was out of salvation. With a plot resembling one of Douglas Sirk melodramas but mixed with the guts of a weirdo movie, perpassing the idea of an "The Collector" (Fowles book, Wyler's film), "Boxing Helena" tells the story of a doctor (Julian Sands) so obsessed with the beautiful Helena (Sherilyn Fenn) of whom he had one night stand (but we never see that), that after an accident she suffered decides to take care of her in his house. She hates him, humiliates him but she can't go anywhere because he amputated her limbs, remaining under his care, devotion, love and obsession for 24/7. From this point on the movie evolves into a strange therapy where the doctor becomes the patient sharing (or forced to do so) his sexual insecurities with women, being analyzed by Helena the woman of his dreams and thoughts. Such transition is unexplainable, confusing, lacking in tension but filled of eroticism. The whole thing resembles an erotic film of the worst category. One can even claim to have seen soft core flicks better than this, with solid acting and far more exciting. The worst kind of criticism one can make about this film is saying that Jennifer Lynch failed to be like her father or that her work isn't so gripping like the ones the creator of "Blue Velvet" makes. Inspiration or similar sequences can be found in her work though (the opening scene for instance). She tried to find a way of her own (which is good) by created something more perverse, more melodramatic and more erotic in sensual scenes that lose their appeal very easily. Makes good use of the soundtrack (the scene where the doctor spies Helena, with Tears for Fears playing in the background) and that's the biggest achievement she controls here. What prevents "Boxing Helena" of being a good movie isn't its painful story or it's lack of imagination in having better moments. More upsetting than anything else is the bad performances from the main cast, something bad but so bad that you have to see it with your own eyes. Sands and Fenn are sexy and good to look at but boy, they do suck terribly here. Poor delivery of lines, unconvincing acting and the film editing that only made look ridiculous (the scene where he's running after seeing her with another man tops it all, is so pathetic that you wanna cover your eyes) and we feel embarrassed for them. And more embarrassing than that is seeing notable names like Bill Paxton, Kurtwood Smith and Art Garfunkel giving some good performances that go to waste in this little project. It's OK for a movie to be weird, twisted and disturbing as long as they have something plausible to say, something to see life with another perspective. Take a look at Cronenberg's "Crash", another movie about strange obsessions, fully loaded with eroticism and weird aspects to make one walk out in shock. It was a great film because it has something to show, say and it was well-acted above all. "Boxing..." only ruined itself with cheap acting, the fluency of an rotten erotic flick and with a frightening ending. One can and should aspire for more than just watching films with some hot scenes but lacking in complexity or depth of character and situations. 4/10

    ...but at least it was better than Dune. So in that one regard, and that one regard alone, the daughter of David Lynch has surpassed her father's work. The worst performance of Bill Paxton's career. Nobody in this film elicits any sympathy or even interest...other than a glancing "that guy is okay" for Art Garfunkel. I guess Kurtwood Smith did okay as well, given the absurdity of his lines and the situation his character was placed in - and the ridiculous reaction that was written for him. This thing really is a turd. Not even interesting for the sex or the horror aspect.

    Boxing Helena needs a major reworking. When it wants to, the film can be quite disturbing, I will gladly admit that. Unfortunately I also found myself laughing in places where I don't think I am supposed to. This motion picture is over serious, and completely lost. It may have some use as a pretentious psychology lesson in the Oedipal complex, but it is otherwise dull and useless, not to mention vulgar. Chief Surgeon Dr. Nick Cavanagh, is obsessed with his neighbour Helena, who he had a one night stand with once upon a time. With the recent death of his mother (whom he was equally in love with) Nick is lonely and scared. He needs someone to turn to, or love. He kidnaps Helana, amputates her limbs, and keeps her in his house as almost a pet doll. How far will this go? how long can he hide? Most of the movie takes place in the glamorous mansion which Cavanagh has inherited from his family. It is a charming place, all dressed up, and full of plush. One of the strongest and most ironic images in the movie, is seeing an armless legless girl dressed up like a porcelain doll, in a high chair, and watching the good doctor suck up to her like she is his own kin. The movie actually doesn't make it clear as to whether the Dr. Cavanagh thinks of Helena as his kin or his lover. the more emotional it tries to be, the less effective Boxing Helena becomes. The sheer sloppiness of the acting, writing and direction, are constantly reminding the viewer that this is a movie. Some of the scorning is nice, but for that, just get the soundtrack. Julian Sands' performance is a huge burden on the movie. He is over-romantic and completely unconvincing. Sands delivers his lines as if he is in Romeo and Juliet. In the last two minutes, Boxing Helena recalls David Lynch epically, as it turns into a surrealist feature, and what is more annoying is that the film has literally no ending. The whole thing just becomes an exercise in stupidity. It has nowhere to go, and subsequently, has nowhere to take the audience. Boxing Helena is best left forgotten

    When I saw Boxing Helena, I was young but pretty jaded to motion pictures. I was in a for the shock and ride of my life. Now that I read it was directed by David Lynch's daughter, it doesn't surprise me. I wont belabor the plot or details of the movie, but I will say that as a young man who was pursuing and dating lots of women, this movie really made me think about the vulnerability of even super attractive women, and about what happens when men put no constraints on their desire to chase or own a woman. The fact that it delivered that message in a totally original and effective fashion makes it a top-shelf film in my mind. I will say that I told a few women I thought it was a great film and they were disgusted by it. Too many people took this film far too literally, even though it wasn't literal even within the plot. I actually think it assaults our construction of goddesses in the media at such a root foundation that it's actually a very insurgent, anti-establishment film. It really attacks a materialism associated with the pursuit and existence of beautiful people. It's definitely a thinker's picture. It's a perfect use of film, portraying something you don't want to see in real life to illustrate a point. It's also brilliantly shot and acted. Make up you own mind. There's no other film like it.

    This thriller is one of a kind. The story is compelling and interesting. "Boxing Helena" will lure you in, and once you are caught, cut off your limbs. This is a thriller with lots of depth and detail. The characters are interesting and well cut out. Each bringing lots to the story, and you can immerse yourself in the characters, because they are so well brought to life. Of course, the cast have a lot to do with this as well, and the casting was perfect for each role. The scenery in the movie works well, because it has that touch of personal space to it. It is not scary or dark sets, and it works well for the movie. The movie is not a gory or really scary one, but it will keep you thrilled with its sense of psychological dread. The story goes forward at a constant flow, never leaving you bored. "Boxing Helena" leaves you with something to ponder about once it has ended, and I like that in a movie, that means you actually got something for your money. I recommend that you give this movie a chance if you like a movie with some depth.

    Dr. Nick ("Hi Everybody!") Cavanaugh (Julian Sands) is obsessed with the sexy but incredibly unlikable Helena (Sheryl Fenn) who he once had an affair with. When she pretty much rejects the guy, she ends up being hit by a truck. Does this deter him? No! It just means that he'll amputate her and keep her for himself. Directed by David Lynch's daughter Jennifer, "Boxing Helena" is a movie that at first sounds like a perverse, strange little movie. Instead, it ends up being more of a mix of a pretentious art house movie and a dull 90's soft-core flick (complete with Enigma's song "Sadeness" playing during a sex scene.) Worst yet, the whole thing is a mess. The acting is atrocious, with Sands playing an unlikable, uninteresting, unsympathetic and spineless man, while Fenn plays a character so bitchy that you wonder why any man would want to be with her. Even Bill Paxton (someone I normally like) is unable to lift this up any, as he is also terrible (though that's more due to the terrible script.) At least his hair is outrageously bad, though it's no match for the one Art Garfunkle (yes, THAT Art Garfunkle) has. Add a terrible ending and obvious symbolism (a bird in a cage, how clever!) to the mix, and you get a terrible movie. Little fact: While more is known about Kim Bassinger and the movie, what is less talked about is that Madonna was also offered to play Helena, but turned it down. When the star of "Swept Away", "The Next Best Thing" and "Shanghai Surprise" turns the movie down, you know you have a dud.

    I haven't read through all the comments on Boxing Helena, but I first saw this movie in '97 at the recommendation of a friend who knew my husband. It struck a very sharp cord within me because plot line aside, it very much expressed how it feels to be married to a Sociopath. The obsessiveness, ownership, and control, exactly depicted the emotions I felt. If I didn't relate to it on that level I'm not sure I would have appreciated it as much, but for anyone who wants to know what it feels like to be married to a sociopath...see this movie. If you ARE living with a sociopath...see this movie...it is very validating. BTW, we are no longer married and I have all my limbs. Marie H

    My only recommendation for seeing "Boxing Helena" is for the short scenes flaunting Nicolette Scorsese. Director Jennifer Chambers Lynch should thank me for my saying so, because upon many a heterosexual male once reading that and remembering Nicolette from her role as the gorgeous lingerie saleswoman in "Christmas Vacation", there should be a spike in "Boxing Helena" rentals/purchases. Julian Sands plays a physician who is obsessed with Sherilyn Fenn, an ex-lover. Fenn doesn't dig him too much, however. When she suffers a terrible accident, Sands goes to town with her extremities and she is left a captive at his mercy. "Boxing Helena" is depressing, uneventful, morbidly perverse in a boring sort of way, and ultimately an unmemorable waste of time. This, for me, was the turning point for Julian Sands where his career took a nose dive. In my opinion, it did little for Fenn's struggling career either, which has never seemed to completely lift off the ground.

It really attacks a materialism associated with the pursuit and existence of beautiful people. It's definitely a thinker's picture. It's a perfect use of film, portraying something you don't want to see in real life to illustrate a point. It's also brilliantly shot and acted. Make up you own mind. There's no other film like it.

    This thriller is one of a kind. The story is compelling and interesting. "Boxing Helena" will lure you in, and once you are caught, cut off your limbs. This is a thriller with lots of depth and detail. The characters are interesting and well cut out. Each bringing lots to the story, and you can immerse yourself in the characters, because they are so well brought to life. Of course, the cast have a lot to do with this as well, and the casting was perfect for each role. The scenery in the movie works well, because it has that touch of personal space to it. It is not scary or dark sets, and it works well for the movie. The movie is not a gory or really scary one, but it will keep you thrilled with its sense of psychological dread. The story goes forward at a constant flow, never leaving you bored. "Boxing Helena" leaves you with something to ponder about once it has ended, and I like that in a movie, that means you actually got something for your money. I recommend that you give this movie a chance if you like a movie with some depth.

    Dr. Nick ("Hi Everybody!") Cavanaugh (Julian Sands) is obsessed with the sexy but incredibly unlikable Helena (Sheryl Fenn) who he once had an affair with. When she pretty much rejects the guy, she ends up being hit by a truck. Does this deter him? No! It just means that he'll amputate her and keep her for himself. Directed by David Lynch's daughter Jennifer, "Boxing Helena" is a movie that at first sounds like a perverse, strange little movie. Instead, it ends up being more of a mix of a pretentious art house movie and a dull 90's soft-core flick (complete with Enigma's song "Sadeness" playing during a sex scene.) Worst yet, the whole thing is a mess. The acting is atrocious, with Sands playing an unlikable, uninteresting, unsympathetic and spineless man, while Fenn plays a character so bitchy that you wonder why any man would want to be with her. Even Bill Paxton (someone I normally like) is unable to lift this up any, as he is also terrible (though that's more due to the terrible script.) At least his hair is outrageously bad, though it's no match for the one Art Garfunkle (yes, THAT Art Garfunkle) has. Add a terrible ending and obvious symbolism (a bird in a cage, how clever!) to the mix, and you get a terrible movie. Little fact: While more is known about Kim Bassinger and the movie, what is less talked about is that Madonna was also offered to play Helena, but turned it down. When the star of "Swept Away", "The Next Best Thing" and "Shanghai Surprise" turns the movie down, you know you have a dud.

    I haven't read through all the comments on Boxing Helena, but I first saw this movie in '97 at the recommendation of a friend who knew my husband. It struck a very sharp cord within me because plot line aside, it very much expressed how it feels to be married to a Sociopath. The obsessiveness, ownership, and control, exactly depicted the emotions I felt. If I didn't relate to it on that level I'm not sure I would have appreciated it as much, but for anyone who wants to know what it feels like to be married to a sociopath...see this movie. If you ARE living with a sociopath...see this movie...it is very validating. BTW, we are no longer married and I have all my limbs. Marie H

    My only recommendation for seeing "Boxing Helena" is for the short scenes flaunting Nicolette Scorsese. Director Jennifer Chambers Lynch should thank me for my saying so, because upon many a heterosexual male once reading that and remembering Nicolette from her role as the gorgeous lingerie saleswoman in "Christmas Vacation", there should be a spike in "Boxing Helena" rentals/purchases. Julian Sands plays a physician who is obsessed with Sherilyn Fenn, an ex-lover. Fenn doesn't dig him too much, however. When she suffers a terrible accident, Sands goes to town with her extremities and she is left a captive at his mercy. "Boxing Helena" is depressing, uneventful, morbidly perverse in a boring sort of way, and ultimately an unmemorable waste of time. This, for me, was the turning point for Julian Sands where his career took a nose dive. In my opinion, it did little for Fenn's struggling career either, which has never seemed to completely lift off the ground.

    At it's core, the idea of Boxing Helena is interesting and pretty darn twisted. Knowing about it before hand was the only thing that kept me watching. It's a brave and unique premise for a movie. But it doesn't ever get good. Or shocking. From the get go the doctor comes off as odd and a little creepy. (And for some reason he's applying ear medicine and has cotton stuffed in his ear the whole movie. Why? I couldn't tell you.) His obsession with the (Needlessly?) bitchy Helena is questionable and for some reason there are scattered allusions to some kind of tainted past with his mother. About 45 minutes in, if he hadn't been set up to be so obvious, there could have been a real shock reveal when we find out what he's been up to. This movie tries, for some reason, to scatter erotica around too. There's a far too long slow motion scene where Helena gets undressed and jumps in a fountain at a party. You know, like you do. A scene from nowhere, where Dr. Nick has sex with a completely random and nameless woman to entertain Helena, who apparently reaches some kind of climax by watching this despite the fact that at this point in the movie, she can't possibly do that by herself. To top it all off it ends with - I'm not kidding you - "Oh, it was all a dream." DO NOT waste two hours on this flick, even if the plot sounds as intriguing to you as it did to me. It's a perfect example of how a good idea can be executed incredibly poorly.

    Personally i love the movie & for those lucky people that live in Atlanta or Georgia, Can see the Nick Cavanaugh Mansion which it states on here that it is Lullwater Road, Druid Hills which is wrong. The Correct Address is 3467 Castlegate DR,NW,Atlanta,GA. Sherilyn Fenn Looks Fantastic as Helena & in my opinion her best performance to date as i have seen 22 of her movies. Nick Cavanaugh is a Brilliant Atlanta Surgeon who seems to be Sexually Repressed, & one night meets the Sexy Helena & has a one night stand & falls in love with her & becomes Obsessed by her & everything she stands for. After the Death of his Mother Nick decides to keep the family mansion & throws a house warming party on the chance Helena will arrive & she does not caring for his hospitality. Once she has freshen up in his fountain she goes with one of Nicks Party Guests a fellow Surgeon for a one night stand & leaves her address book. She asks nick to bring her address book to the airport as he tricks her by coming late & so she comes to his mansion to collect, as Nick plays games with her wanting to eat & drink with her she then storms out & gets knock over by a car. Nick then has her captive in his House & amputates her injured leg & gradually finishes the job off by removing both arms & legs as a statue of sexual desire. By then belonging to him & so gradually she becomes dependant on him. A Brilliant film which does'nt get the credit it deserves the story may be daft but the point the director gets across is brilliantly shot with the fantasy dream visions of his mum is fantastic. I would love to see the movie remade.

    Close. Real close. "Boxing Helena" was so close of being good, so close of being an fine and greatly elaborated movie which flies high imagination and weirdness, with pivotal elements of a twisted cult movie. Directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch, daughter of the great David Lynch, "Boxing..." can be very enjoyable, an guilty pleasure to some or even an masterpiece to a few. To me, it was quite good until I realize it was going nowhere, completely problematic and when her speech started to fade away into a nebulous emptiness the movie was out of salvation. With a plot resembling one of Douglas Sirk melodramas but mixed with the guts of a weirdo movie, perpassing the idea of an "The Collector" (Fowles book, Wyler's film), "Boxing Helena" tells the story of a doctor (Julian Sands) so obsessed with the beautiful Helena (Sherilyn Fenn) of whom he had one night stand (but we never see that), that after an accident she suffered decides to take care of her in his house. She hates him, humiliates him but she can't go anywhere because he amputated her limbs, remaining under his care, devotion, love and obsession for 24/7. From this point on the movie evolves into a strange therapy where the doctor becomes the patient sharing (or forced to do so) his sexual insecurities with women, being analyzed by Helena the woman of his dreams and thoughts. Such transition is unexplainable, confusing, lacking in tension but filled of eroticism. The whole thing resembles an erotic film of the worst category. One can even claim to have seen soft core flicks better than this, with solid acting and far more exciting. The worst kind of criticism one can make about this film is saying that Jennifer Lynch failed to be like her father or that her work isn't so gripping like the ones the creator of "Blue Velvet" makes. Inspiration or similar sequences can be found in her work though (the opening scene for instance). She tried to find a way of her own (which is good) by created something more perverse, more melodramatic and more erotic in sensual scenes that lose their appeal very easily. Makes good use of the soundtrack (the scene where the doctor spies Helena, with Tears for Fears playing in the background) and that's the biggest achievement she controls here. What prevents "Boxing Helena" of being a good movie isn't its painful story or it's lack of imagination in having better moments. More upsetting than anything else is the bad performances from the main cast, something bad but so bad that you have to see it with your own eyes. Sands and Fenn are sexy and good to look at but boy, they do suck terribly here. Poor delivery of lines, unconvincing acting and the film editing that only made look ridiculous (the scene where he's running after seeing her with another man tops it all, is so pathetic that you wanna cover your eyes) and we feel embarrassed for them. And more embarrassing than that is seeing notable names like Bill Paxton, Kurtwood Smith and Art Garfunkel giving some good performances that go to waste in this little project. It's OK for a movie to be weird, twisted and disturbing as long as they have something plausible to say, something to see life with another perspective. Take a look at Cronenberg's "Crash", another movie about strange obsessions, fully loaded with eroticism and weird aspects to make one walk out in shock. It was a great film because it has something to show, say and it was well-acted above all. "Boxing..." only ruined itself with cheap acting, the fluency of an rotten erotic flick and with a frightening ending. One can and should aspire for more than just watching films with some hot scenes but lacking in complexity or depth of character and situations. 4/10

    ...but at least it was better than Dune. So in that one regard, and that one regard alone, the daughter of David Lynch has surpassed her father's work. The worst performance of Bill Paxton's career. Nobody in this film elicits any sympathy or even interest...other than a glancing "that guy is okay" for Art Garfunkel. I guess Kurtwood Smith did okay as well, given the absurdity of his lines and the situation his character was placed in - and the ridiculous reaction that was written for him. This thing really is a turd. Not even interesting for the sex or the horror aspect.

    Boxing Helena needs a major reworking. When it wants to, the film can be quite disturbing, I will gladly admit that. Unfortunately I also found myself laughing in places where I don't think I am supposed to. This motion picture is over serious, and completely lost. It may have some use as a pretentious psychology lesson in the Oedipal complex, but it is otherwise dull and useless, not to mention vulgar. Chief Surgeon Dr. Nick Cavanagh, is obsessed with his neighbour Helena, who he had a one night stand with once upon a time. With the recent death of his mother (whom he was equally in love with) Nick is lonely and scared. He needs someone to turn to, or love. He kidnaps Helana, amputates her limbs, and keeps her in his house as almost a pet doll. How far will this go? how long can he hide? Most of the movie takes place in the glamorous mansion which Cavanagh has inherited from his family. It is a charming place, all dressed up, and full of plush. One of the strongest and most ironic images in the movie, is seeing an armless legless girl dressed up like a porcelain doll, in a high chair, and watching the good doctor suck up to her like she is his own kin. The movie actually doesn't make it clear as to whether the Dr. Cavanagh thinks of Helena as his kin or his lover. the more emotional it tries to be, the less effective Boxing Helena becomes. The sheer sloppiness of the acting, writing and direction, are constantly reminding the viewer that this is a movie. Some of the scorning is nice, but for that, just get the soundtrack. Julian Sands' performance is a huge burden on the movie. He is over-romantic and completely unconvincing. Sands delivers his lines as if he is in Romeo and Juliet. In the last two minutes, Boxing Helena recalls David Lynch epically, as it turns into a surrealist feature, and what is more annoying is that the film has literally no ending. The whole thing just becomes an exercise in stupidity. It has nowhere to go, and subsequently, has nowhere to take the audience. Boxing Helena is best left forgotten

    When I saw Boxing Helena, I was young but pretty jaded to motion pictures. I was in a for the shock and ride of my life. Now that I read it was directed by David Lynch's daughter, it doesn't surprise me. I wont belabor the plot or details of the movie, but I will say that as a young man who was pursuing and dating lots of women, this movie really made me think about the vulnerability of even super attractive women, and about what happens when men put no constraints on their desire to chase or own a woman. The fact that it delivered that message in a totally original and effective fashion makes it a top-shelf film in my mind. I will say that I told a few women I thought it was a great film and they were disgusted by it. Too many people took this film far too literally, even though it wasn't literal even within the plot. I actually think it assaults our construction of goddesses in the media at such a root foundation that it's actually a very insurgent, anti-establishment film. It really attacks a materialism associated with the pursuit and existence of beautiful people. It's definitely a thinker's picture. It's a perfect use of film, portraying something you don't want to see in real life to illustrate a point. It's also brilliantly shot and acted. Make up you own mind. There's no other film like it.

    ...but at least it was better than Dune. So in that one regard, and that one regard alone, the daughter of David Lynch has surpassed her father's work. The worst performance of Bill Paxton's career. Nobody in this film elicits any sympathy or even interest...other than a glancing "that guy is okay" for Art Garfunkel. I guess Kurtwood Smith did okay as well, given the absurdity of his lines and the situation his character was placed in - and the ridiculous reaction that was written for him. This thing really is a turd. Not even interesting for the sex or the horror aspect.

    Boxing Helena needs a major reworking. When it wants to, the film can be quite disturbing, I will gladly admit that. Unfortunately I also found myself laughing in places where I don't think I am supposed to. This motion picture is over serious, and completely lost. It may have some use as a pretentious psychology lesson in the Oedipal complex, but it is otherwise dull and useless, not to mention vulgar. Chief Surgeon Dr. Nick Cavanagh, is obsessed with his neighbour Helena, who he had a one night stand with once upon a time. With the recent death of his mother (whom he was equally in love with) Nick is lonely and scared. He needs someone to turn to, or love. He kidnaps Helana, amputates her limbs, and keeps her in his house as almost a pet doll. How far will this go? how long can he hide? Most of the movie takes place in the glamorous mansion which Cavanagh has inherited from his family. It is a charming place, all dressed up, and full of plush. One of the strongest and most ironic images in the movie, is seeing an armless legless girl dressed up like a porcelain doll, in a high chair, and watching the good doctor suck up to her like she is his own kin. The movie actually doesn't make it clear as to whether the Dr. Cavanagh thinks of Helena as his kin or his lover. the more emotional it tries to be, the less effective Boxing Helena becomes. The sheer sloppiness of the acting, writing and direction, are constantly reminding the viewer that this is a movie. Some of the scorning is nice, but for that, just get the soundtrack. Julian Sands' performance is a huge burden on the movie. He is over-romantic and completely unconvincing. Sands delivers his lines as if he is in Romeo and Juliet. In the last two minutes, Boxing Helena recalls David Lynch epically, as it turns into a surrealist feature, and what is more annoying is that the film has literally no ending. The whole thing just becomes an exercise in stupidity. It has nowhere to go, and subsequently, has nowhere to take the audience. Boxing Helena is best left forgotten

    When I saw Boxing Helena, I was young but pretty jaded to motion pictures. I was in a for the shock and ride of my life. Now that I read it was directed by David Lynch's daughter, it doesn't surprise me. I wont belabor the plot or details of the movie, but I will say that as a young man who was pursuing and dating lots of women, this movie really made me think about the vulnerability of even super attractive women, and about what happens when men put no constraints on their desire to chase or own a woman. The fact that it delivered that message in a totally original and effective fashion makes it a top-shelf film in my mind. I will say that I told a few women I thought it was a great film and they were disgusted by it. Too many people took this film far too literally, even though it wasn't literal even within the plot. I actually think it assaults our construction of goddesses in the media at such a root foundation that it's actually a very insurgent, anti-establishment film. It really attacks a materialism associated with the pursuit and existence of beautiful people. It's definitely a thinker's picture. It's a perfect use of film, portraying something you don't want to see in real life to illustrate a point. It's also brilliantly shot and acted. Make up you own mind. There's no other film like it.

    This thriller is one of a kind. The story is compelling and interesting. "Boxing Helena" will lure you in, and once you are caught, cut off your limbs. This is a thriller with lots of depth and detail. The characters are interesting and well cut out. Each bringing lots to the story, and you can immerse yourself in the characters, because they are so well brought to life. Of course, the cast have a lot to do with this as well, and the casting was perfect for each role. The scenery in the movie works well, because it has that touch of personal space to it. It is not scary or dark sets, and it works well for the movie. The movie is not a gory or really scary one, but it will keep you thrilled with its sense of psychological dread. The story goes forward at a constant flow, never leaving you bored. "Boxing Helena" leaves you with something to ponder about once it has ended, and I like that in a movie, that means you actually got something for your money. I recommend that you give this movie a chance if you like a movie with some depth.

    Dr. Nick ("Hi Everybody!") Cavanaugh (Julian Sands) is obsessed with the sexy but incredibly unlikable Helena (Sheryl Fenn) who he once had an affair with. When she pretty much rejects the guy, she ends up being hit by a truck. Does this deter him? No! It just means that he'll amputate her and keep her for himself. Directed by David Lynch's daughter Jennifer, "Boxing Helena" is a movie that at first sounds like a perverse, strange little movie. Instead, it ends up being more of a mix of a pretentious art house movie and a dull 90's soft-core flick (complete with Enigma's song "Sadeness" playing during a sex scene.) Worst yet, the whole thing is a mess. The acting is atrocious, with Sands playing an unlikable, uninteresting, unsympathetic and spineless man, while Fenn plays a character so bitchy that you wonder why any man would want to be with her. Even Bill Paxton (someone I normally like) is unable to lift this up any, as he is also terrible (though that's more due to the terrible script.) At least his hair is outrageously bad, though it's no match for the one Art Garfunkle (yes, THAT Art Garfunkle) has. Add a terrible ending and obvious symbolism (a bird in a cage, how clever!) to the mix, and you get a terrible movie. Little fact: While more is known about Kim Bassinger and the movie, what is less talked about is that Madonna was also offered to play Helena, but turned it down. When the star of "Swept Away", "The Next Best Thing" and "Shanghai Surprise" turns the movie down, you know you have a dud.

    I haven't read through all the comments on Boxing Helena, but I first saw this movie in '97 at the recommendation of a friend who knew my husband. It struck a very sharp cord within me because plot line aside, it very much expressed how it feels to be married to a Sociopath. The obsessiveness, ownership, and control, exactly depicted the emotions I felt. If I didn't relate to it on that level I'm not sure I would have appreciated it as much, but for anyone who wants to know what it feels like to be married to a sociopath...see this movie. If you ARE living with a sociopath...see this movie...it is very validating. BTW, we are no longer married and I have all my limbs. Marie H

    My only recommendation for seeing "Boxing Helena" is for the short scenes flaunting Nicolette Scorsese. Director Jennifer Chambers Lynch should thank me for my saying so, because upon many a heterosexual male once reading that and remembering Nicolette from her role as the gorgeous lingerie saleswoman in "Christmas Vacation", there should be a spike in "Boxing Helena" rentals/purchases. Julian Sands plays a physician who is obsessed with Sherilyn Fenn, an ex-lover. Fenn doesn't dig him too much, however. When she suffers a terrible accident, Sands goes to town with her extremities and she is left a captive at his mercy. "Boxing Helena" is depressing, uneventful, morbidly perverse in a boring sort of way, and ultimately an unmemorable waste of time. This, for me, was the turning point for Julian Sands where his career took a nose dive. In my opinion, it did little for Fenn's struggling career either, which has never seemed to completely lift off the ground.

    At it's core, the idea of Boxing Helena is interesting and pretty darn twisted. Knowing about it before hand was the only thing that kept me watching. It's a brave and unique premise for a movie. But it doesn't ever get good. Or shocking. From the get go the doctor comes off as odd and a little creepy. (And for some reason he's applying ear medicine and has cotton stuffed in his ear the whole movie. Why? I couldn't tell you.) His obsession with the (Needlessly?) bitchy Helena is questionable and for some reason there are scattered allusions to some kind of tainted past with his mother. About 45 minutes in, if he hadn't been set up to be so obvious, there could have been a real shock reveal when we find out what he's been up to. This movie tries, for some reason, to scatter erotica around too. There's a far too long slow motion scene where Helena gets undressed and jumps in a fountain at a party. You know, like you do. A scene from nowhere, where Dr. Nick has sex with a completely random and nameless woman to entertain Helena, who apparently reaches some kind of climax by watching this despite the fact that at this point in the movie, she can't possibly do that by herself. To top it all off it ends with - I'm not kidding you - "Oh, it was all a dream." DO NOT waste two hours on this flick, even if the plot sounds as intriguing to you as it did to me. It's a perfect example of how a good idea can be executed incredibly poorly.

    Personally i love the movie & for those lucky people that live in Atlanta or Georgia, Can see the Nick Cavanaugh Mansion which it states on here that it is Lullwater Road, Druid Hills which is wrong. The Correct Address is 3467 Castlegate DR,NW,Atlanta,GA. Sherilyn Fenn Looks Fantastic as Helena & in my opinion her best performance to date as i have seen 22 of her movies. Nick Cavanaugh is a Brilliant Atlanta Surgeon who seems to be Sexually Repressed, & one night meets the Sexy Helena & has a one night stand & falls in love with her & becomes Obsessed by her & everything she stands for. After the Death of his Mother Nick decides to keep the family mansion & throws a house warming party on the chance Helena will arrive & she does not caring for his hospitality. Once she has freshen up in his fountain she goes with one of Nicks Party Guests a fellow Surgeon for a one night stand & leaves her address book. She asks nick to bring her address book to the airport as he tricks her by coming late & so she comes to his mansion to collect, as Nick plays games with her wanting to eat & drink with her she then storms out & gets knock over by a car. Nick then has her captive in his House & amputates her injured leg & gradually finishes the job off by removing both arms & legs as a statue of sexual desire. By then belonging to him & so gradually she becomes dependant on him. A Brilliant film which does'nt get the credit it deserves the story may be daft but the point the director gets across is brilliantly shot with the fantasy dream visions of his mum is fantastic. I would love to see the movie remade.

    Close. Real close. "Boxing Helena" was so close of being good, so close of being an fine and greatly elaborated movie which flies high imagination and weirdness, with pivotal elements of a twisted cult movie. Directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch, daughter of the great David Lynch, "Boxing..." can be very enjoyable, an guilty pleasure to some or even an masterpiece to a few. To me, it was quite good until I realize it was going nowhere, completely problematic and when her speech started to fade away into a nebulous emptiness the movie was out of salvation. With a plot resembling one of Douglas Sirk melodramas but mixed with the guts of a weirdo movie, perpassing the idea of an "The Collector" (Fowles book, Wyler's film), "Boxing Helena" tells the story of a doctor (Julian Sands) so obsessed with the beautiful Helena (Sherilyn Fenn) of whom he had one night stand (but we never see that), that after an accident she suffered decides to take care of her in his house. She hates him, humiliates him but she can't go anywhere because he amputated her limbs, remaining under his care, devotion, love and obsession for 24/7. From this point on the movie evolves into a strange therapy where the doctor becomes the patient sharing (or forced to do so) his sexual insecurities with women, being analyzed by Helena the woman of his dreams and thoughts. Such transition is unexplainable, confusing, lacking in tension but filled of eroticism. The whole thing resembles an erotic film of the worst category. One can even claim to have seen soft core flicks better than this, with solid acting and far more exciting. The worst kind of criticism one can make about this film is saying that Jennifer Lynch failed to be like her father or that her work isn't so gripping like the ones the creator of "Blue Velvet" makes. Inspiration or similar sequences can be found in her work though (the opening scene for instance). She tried to find a way of her own (which is good) by created something more perverse, more melodramatic and more erotic in sensual scenes that lose their appeal very easily. Makes good use of the soundtrack (the scene where the doctor spies Helena, with Tears for Fears playing in the background) and that's the biggest achievement she controls here. What prevents "Boxing Helena" of being a good movie isn't its painful story or it's lack of imagination in having better moments. More upsetting than anything else is the bad performances from the main cast, something bad but so bad that you have to see it with your own eyes. Sands and Fenn are sexy and good to look at but boy, they do suck terribly here. Poor delivery of lines, unconvincing acting and the film editing that only made look ridiculous (the scene where he's running after seeing her with another man tops it all, is so pathetic that you wanna cover your eyes) and we feel embarrassed for them. And more embarrassing than that is seeing notable names like Bill Paxton, Kurtwood Smith and Art Garfunkel giving some good performances that go to waste in this little project. It's OK for a movie to be weird, twisted and disturbing as long as they have something plausible to say, something to see life with another perspective. Take a look at Cronenberg's "Crash", another movie about strange obsessions, fully loaded with eroticism and weird aspects to make one walk out in shock. It was a great film because it has something to show, say and it was well-acted above all. "Boxing..." only ruined itself with cheap acting, the fluency of an rotten erotic flick and with a frightening ending. One can and should aspire for more than just watching films with some hot scenes but lacking in complexity or depth of character and situations. 4/10

    Close. Real close. "Boxing Helena" was so close of being good, so close of being an fine and greatly elaborated movie which flies high imagination and weirdness, with pivotal elements of a twisted cult movie. Directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch, daughter of the great David Lynch, "Boxing..." can be very enjoyable, an guilty pleasure to some or even an masterpiece to a few. To me, it was quite good until I realize it was going nowhere, completely problematic and when her speech started to fade away into a nebulous emptiness the movie was out of salvation. With a plot resembling one of Douglas Sirk melodramas but mixed with the guts of a weirdo movie, perpassing the idea of an "The Collector" (Fowles book, Wyler's film), "Boxing Helena" tells the story of a doctor (Julian Sands) so obsessed with the beautiful Helena (Sherilyn Fenn) of whom he had one night stand (but we never see that), that after an accident she suffered decides to take care of her in his house. She hates him, humiliates him but she can't go anywhere because he amputated her limbs, remaining under his care, devotion, love and obsession for 24/7. From this point on the movie evolves into a strange therapy where the doctor becomes the patient sharing (or forced to do so) his sexual insecurities with women, being analyzed by Helena the woman of his dreams and thoughts. Such transition is unexplainable, confusing, lacking in tension but filled of eroticism. The whole thing resembles an erotic film of the worst category. One can even claim to have seen soft core flicks better than this, with solid acting and far more exciting. The worst kind of criticism one can make about this film is saying that Jennifer Lynch failed to be like her father or that her work isn't so gripping like the ones the creator of "Blue Velvet" makes. Inspiration or similar sequences can be found in her work though (the opening scene for instance). She tried to find a way of her own (which is good) by created something more perverse, more melodramatic and more erotic in sensual scenes that lose their appeal very easily. Makes good use of the soundtrack (the scene where the doctor spies Helena, with Tears for Fears playing in the background) and that's the biggest achievement she controls here. What prevents "Boxing Helena" of being a good movie isn't its painful story or it's lack of imagination in having better moments. More upsetting than anything else is the bad performances from the main cast, something bad but so bad that you have to see it with your own eyes. Sands and Fenn are sexy and good to look at but boy, they do suck terribly here. Poor delivery of lines, unconvincing acting and the film editing that only made look ridiculous (the scene where he's running after seeing her with another man tops it all, is so pathetic that you wanna cover your eyes) and we feel embarrassed for them. And more embarrassing than that is seeing notable names like Bill Paxton, Kurtwood Smith and Art Garfunkel giving some good performances that go to waste in this little project. It's OK for a movie to be weird, twisted and disturbing as long as they have something plausible to say, something to see life with another perspective. Take a look at Cronenberg's "Crash", another movie about strange obsessions, fully loaded with eroticism and weird aspects to make one walk out in shock. It was a great film because it has something to show, say and it was well-acted above all. "Boxing..." only ruined itself with cheap acting, the fluency of an rotten erotic flick and with a frightening ending. One can and should aspire for more than just watching films with some hot scenes but lacking in complexity or depth of character and situations. 4/10

    ...but at least it was better than Dune. So in that one regard, and that one regard alone, the daughter of David Lynch has surpassed her father's work. The worst performance of Bill Paxton's career. Nobody in this film elicits any sympathy or even interest...other than a glancing "that guy is okay" for Art Garfunkel. I guess Kurtwood Smith did okay as well, given the absurdity of his lines and the situation his character was placed in - and the ridiculous reaction that was written for him. This thing really is a turd. Not even interesting for the sex or the horror aspect.

    Boxing Helena needs a major reworking. When it wants to, the film can be quite disturbing, I will gladly admit that. Unfortunately I also found myself laughing in places where I don't think I am supposed to. This motion picture is over serious, and completely lost. It may have some use as a pretentious psychology lesson in the Oedipal complex, but it is otherwise dull and useless, not to mention vulgar. Chief Surgeon Dr. Nick Cavanagh, is obsessed with his neighbour Helena, who he had a one night stand with once upon a time. With the recent death of his mother (whom he was equally in love with) Nick is lonely and scared. He needs someone to turn to, or love. He kidnaps Helana, amputates her limbs, and keeps her in his house as almost a pet doll. How far will this go? how long can he hide? Most of the movie takes place in the glamorous mansion which Cavanagh has inherited from his family. It is a charming place, all dressed up, and full of plush. One of the strongest and most ironic images in the movie, is seeing an armless legless girl dressed up like a porcelain doll, in a high chair, and watching the good doctor suck up to her like she is his own kin. The movie actually doesn't make it clear as to whether the Dr. Cavanagh thinks of Helena as his kin or his lover. the more emotional it tries to be, the less effective Boxing Helena becomes. The sheer sloppiness of the acting, writing and direction, are constantly reminding the viewer that this is a movie. Some of the scorning is nice, but for that, just get the soundtrack. Julian Sands' performance is a huge burden on the movie. He is over-romantic and completely unconvincing. Sands delivers his lines as if he is in Romeo and Juliet. In the last two minutes, Boxing Helena recalls David Lynch epically, as it turns into a surrealist feature, and what is more annoying is that the film has literally no ending. The whole thing just becomes an exercise in stupidity. It has nowhere to go, and subsequently, has nowhere to take the audience. Boxing Helena is best left forgotten

    When I saw Boxing Helena, I was young but pretty jaded to motion pictures. I was in a for the shock and ride of my life. Now that I read it was directed by David Lynch's daughter, it doesn't surprise me. I wont belabor the plot or details of the movie, but I will say that as a young man who was pursuing and dating lots of women, this movie really made me think about the vulnerability of even super attractive women, and about what happens when men put no constraints on their desire to chase or own a woman. The fact that it delivered that message in a totally original and effective fashion makes it a top-shelf film in my mind. I will say that I told a few women I thought it was a great film and they were disgusted by it. Too many people took this film far too literally, even though it wasn't literal even within the plot. I actually think it assaults our construction of goddesses in the media at such a root foundation that it's actually a very insurgent, anti-establishment film. It really attacks a materialism associated with the pursuit and existence of beautiful people. It's definitely a thinker's picture. It's a perfect use of film, portraying something you don't want to see in real life to illustrate a point. It's also brilliantly shot and acted. Make up you own mind. There's no other film like it.

    This thriller is one of a kind. The story is compelling and interesting. "Boxing Helena" will lure you in, and once you are caught, cut off your limbs. This is a thriller with lots of depth and detail. The characters are interesting and well cut out. Each bringing lots to the story, and you can immerse yourself in the characters, because they are so well brought to life. Of course, the cast have a lot to do with this as well, and the casting was perfect for each role. The scenery in the movie works well, because it has that touch of personal space to it. It is not scary or dark sets, and it works well for the movie. The movie is not a gory or really scary one, but it will keep you thrilled with its sense of psychological dread. The story goes forward at a constant flow, never leaving you bored. "Boxing Helena" leaves you with something to ponder about once it has ended, and I like that in a movie, that means you actually got something for your money. I recommend that you give this movie a chance if you like a movie with some depth.

    Dr. Nick ("Hi Everybody!") Cavanaugh (Julian Sands) is obsessed with the sexy but incredibly unlikable Helena (Sheryl Fenn) who he once had an affair with. When she pretty much rejects the guy, she ends up being hit by a truck. Does this deter him? No! It just means that he'll amputate her and keep her for himself. Directed by David Lynch's daughter Jennifer, "Boxing Helena" is a movie that at first sounds like a perverse, strange little movie. Instead, it ends up being more of a mix of a pretentious art house movie and a dull 90's soft-core flick (complete with Enigma's song "Sadeness" playing during a sex scene.) Worst yet, the whole thing is a mess. The acting is atrocious, with Sands playing an unlikable, uninteresting, unsympathetic and spineless man, while Fenn plays a character so bitchy that you wonder why any man would want to be with her. Even Bill Paxton (someone I normally like) is unable to lift this up any, as he is also terrible (though that's more due to the terrible script.) At least his hair is outrageously bad, though it's no match for the one Art Garfunkle (yes, THAT Art Garfunkle) has. Add a terrible ending and obvious symbolism (a bird in a cage, how clever!) to the mix, and you get a terrible movie. Little fact: While more is known about Kim Bassinger and the movie, what is less talked about is that Madonna was also offered to play Helena, but turned it down. When the star of "Swept Away", "The Next Best Thing" and "Shanghai Surprise" turns the movie down, you know you have a dud.

    I haven't read through all the comments on Boxing Helena, but I first saw this movie in '97 at the recommendation of a friend who knew my husband. It struck a very sharp cord within me because plot line aside, it very much expressed how it feels to be married to a Sociopath. The obsessiveness, ownership, and control, exactly depicted the emotions I felt. If I didn't relate to it on that level I'm not sure I would have appreciated it as much, but for anyone who wants to know what it feels like to be married to a sociopath...see this movie. If you ARE living with a sociopath...see this movie...it is very validating. BTW, we are no longer married and I have all my limbs. Marie H

    My only recommendation for seeing "Boxing Helena" is for the short scenes flaunting Nicolette Scorsese. Director Jennifer Chambers Lynch should thank me for my saying so, because upon many a heterosexual male once reading that and remembering Nicolette from her role as the gorgeous lingerie saleswoman in "Christmas Vacation", there should be a spike in "Boxing Helena" rentals/purchases. Julian Sands plays a physician who is obsessed with Sherilyn Fenn, an ex-lover. Fenn doesn't dig him too much, however. When she suffers a terrible accident, Sands goes to town with her extremities and she is left a captive at his mercy. "Boxing Helena" is depressing, uneventful, morbidly perverse in a boring sort of way, and ultimately an unmemorable waste of time. This, for me, was the turning point for Julian Sands where his career took a nose dive. In my opinion, it did little for Fenn's struggling career either, which has never seemed to completely lift off the ground.

    At it's core, the idea of Boxing Helena is interesting and pretty darn twisted. Knowing about it before hand was the only thing that kept me watching. It's a brave and unique premise for a movie. But it doesn't ever get good. Or shocking. From the get go the doctor comes off as odd and a little creepy. (And for some reason he's applying ear medicine and has cotton stuffed in his ear the whole movie. Why? I couldn't tell you.) His obsession with the (Needlessly?) bitchy Helena is questionable and for some reason there are scattered allusions to some kind of tainted past with his mother. About 45 minutes in, if he hadn't been set up to be so obvious, there could have been a real shock reveal when we find out what he's been up to. This movie tries, for some reason, to scatter erotica around too. There's a far too long slow motion scene where Helena gets undressed and jumps in a fountain at a party. You know, like you do. A scene from nowhere, where Dr. Nick has sex with a completely random and nameless woman to entertain Helena, who apparently reaches some kind of climax by watching this despite the fact that at this point in the movie, she can't possibly do that by herself. To top it all off it ends with - I'm not kidding you - "Oh, it was all a dream." DO NOT waste two hours on this flick, even if the plot sounds as intriguing to you as it did to me. It's a perfect example of how a good idea can be executed incredibly poorly.

    Personally i love the movie & for those lucky people that live in Atlanta or Georgia, Can see the Nick Cavanaugh Mansion which it states on here that it is Lullwater Road, Druid Hills which is wrong. The Correct Address is 3467 Castlegate DR,NW,Atlanta,GA. Sherilyn Fenn Looks Fantastic as Helena & in my opinion her best performance to date as i have seen 22 of her movies. Nick Cavanaugh is a Brilliant Atlanta Surgeon who seems to be Sexually Repressed, & one night meets the Sexy Helena & has a one night stand & falls in love with her & becomes Obsessed by her & everything she stands for. After the Death of his Mother Nick decides to keep the family mansion & throws a house warming party on the chance Helena will arrive & she does not caring for his hospitality. Once she has freshen up in his fountain she goes with one of Nicks Party Guests a fellow Surgeon for a one night stand & leaves her address book. She asks nick to bring her address book to the airport as he tricks her by coming late & so she comes to his mansion to collect, as Nick plays games with her wanting to eat & drink with her she then storms out & gets knock over by a car. Nick then has her captive in his House & amputates her injured leg & gradually finishes the job off by removing both arms & legs as a statue of sexual desire. By then belonging to him & so gradually she becomes dependant on him. A Brilliant film which does'nt get the credit it deserves the story may be daft but the point the director gets across is brilliantly shot with the fantasy dream visions of his mum is fantastic. I would love to see the movie remade.

    At it's core, the idea of Boxing Helena is interesting and pretty darn twisted. Knowing about it before hand was the only thing that kept me watching. It's a brave and unique premise for a movie. But it doesn't ever get good. Or shocking. From the get go the doctor comes off as odd and a little creepy. (And for some reason he's applying ear medicine and has cotton stuffed in his ear the whole movie. Why? I couldn't tell you.) His obsession with the (Needlessly?) bitchy Helena is questionable and for some reason there are scattered allusions to some kind of tainted past with his mother. About 45 minutes in, if he hadn't been set up to be so obvious, there could have been a real shock reveal when we find out what he's been up to. This movie tries, for some reason, to scatter erotica around too. There's a far too long slow motion scene where Helena gets undressed and jumps in a fountain at a party. You know, like you do. A scene from nowhere, where Dr. Nick has sex with a completely random and nameless woman to entertain Helena, who apparently reaches some kind of climax by watching this despite the fact that at this point in the movie, she can't possibly do that by herself. To top it all off it ends with - I'm not kidding you - "Oh, it was all a dream." DO NOT waste two hours on this flick, even if the plot sounds as intriguing to you as it did to me. It's a perfect example of how a good idea can be executed incredibly poorly.

    Personally i love the movie & for those lucky people that live in Atlanta or Georgia, Can see the Nick Cavanaugh Mansion which it states on here that it is Lullwater Road, Druid Hills which is wrong. The Correct Address is 3467 Castlegate DR,NW,Atlanta,GA. Sherilyn Fenn Looks Fantastic as Helena & in my opinion her best performance to date as i have seen 22 of her movies. Nick Cavanaugh is a Brilliant Atlanta Surgeon who seems to be Sexually Repressed, & one night meets the Sexy Helena & has a one night stand & falls in love with her & becomes Obsessed by her & everything she stands for. After the Death of his Mother Nick decides to keep the family mansion & throws a house warming party on the chance Helena will arrive & she does not caring for his hospitality. Once she has freshen up in his fountain she goes with one of Nicks Party Guests a fellow Surgeon for a one night stand & leaves her address book. She asks nick to bring her address book to the airport as he tricks her by coming late & so she comes to his mansion to collect, as Nick plays games with her wanting to eat & drink with her she then storms out & gets knock over by a car. Nick then has her captive in his House & amputates her injured leg & gradually finishes the job off by removing both arms & legs as a statue of sexual desire. By then belonging to him & so gradually she becomes dependant on him. A Brilliant film which does'nt get the credit it deserves the story may be daft but the point the director gets across is brilliantly shot with the fantasy dream visions of his mum is fantastic. I would love to see the movie remade.

    Close. Real close. "Boxing Helena" was so close of being good, so close of being an fine and greatly elaborated movie which flies high imagination and weirdness, with pivotal elements of a twisted cult movie. Directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch, daughter of the great David Lynch, "Boxing..." can be very enjoyable, an guilty pleasure to some or even an masterpiece to a few. To me, it was quite good until I realize it was going nowhere, completely problematic and when her speech started to fade away into a nebulous emptiness the movie was out of salvation. With a plot resembling one of Douglas Sirk melodramas but mixed with the guts of a weirdo movie, perpassing the idea of an "The Collector" (Fowles book, Wyler's film), "Boxing Helena" tells the story of a doctor (Julian Sands) so obsessed with the beautiful Helena (Sherilyn Fenn) of whom he had one night stand (but we never see that), that after an accident she suffered decides to take care of her in his house. She hates him, humiliates him but she can't go anywhere because he amputated her limbs, remaining under his care, devotion, love and obsession for 24/7. From this point on the movie evolves into a strange therapy where the doctor becomes the patient sharing (or forced to do so) his sexual insecurities with women, being analyzed by Helena the woman of his dreams and thoughts. Such transition is unexplainable, confusing, lacking in tension but filled of eroticism. The whole thing resembles an erotic film of the worst category. One can even claim to have seen soft core flicks better than this, with solid acting and far more exciting. The worst kind of criticism one can make about this film is saying that Jennifer Lynch failed to be like her father or that her work isn't so gripping like the ones the creator of "Blue Velvet" makes. Inspiration or similar sequences can be found in her work though (the opening scene for instance). She tried to find a way of her own (which is good) by created something more perverse, more melodramatic and more erotic in sensual scenes that lose their appeal very easily. Makes good use of the soundtrack (the scene where the doctor spies Helena, with Tears for Fears playing in the background) and that's the biggest achievement she controls here. What prevents "Boxing Helena" of being a good movie isn't its painful story or it's lack of imagination in having better moments. More upsetting than anything else is the bad performances from the main cast, something bad but so bad that you have to see it with your own eyes. Sands and Fenn are sexy and good to look at but boy, they do suck terribly here. Poor delivery of lines, unconvincing acting and the film editing that only made look ridiculous (the scene where he's running after seeing her with another man tops it all, is so pathetic that you wanna cover your eyes) and we feel embarrassed for them. And more embarrassing than that is seeing notable names like Bill Paxton, Kurtwood Smith and Art Garfunkel giving some good performances that go to waste in this little project. It's OK for a movie to be weird, twisted and disturbing as long as they have something plausible to say, something to see life with another perspective. Take a look at Cronenberg's "Crash", another movie about strange obsessions, fully loaded with eroticism and weird aspects to make one walk out in shock. It was a great film because it has something to show, say and it was well-acted above all. "Boxing..." only ruined itself with cheap acting, the fluency of an rotten erotic flick and with a frightening ending. One can and should aspire for more than just watching films with some hot scenes but lacking in complexity or depth of character and situations. 4/10

    ...but at least it was better than Dune. So in that one regard, and that one regard alone, the daughter of David Lynch has surpassed her father's work. The worst performance of Bill Paxton's career. Nobody in this film elicits any sympathy or even interest...other than a glancing "that guy is okay" for Art Garfunkel. I guess Kurtwood Smith did okay as well, given the absurdity of his lines and the situation his character was placed in - and the ridiculous reaction that was written for him. This thing really is a turd. Not even interesting for the sex or the horror aspect.

    Boxing Helena needs a major reworking. When it wants to, the film can be quite disturbing, I will gladly admit that. Unfortunately I also found myself laughing in places where I don't think I am supposed to. This motion picture is over serious, and completely lost. It may have some use as a pretentious psychology lesson in the Oedipal complex, but it is otherwise dull and useless, not to mention vulgar. Chief Surgeon Dr. Nick Cavanagh, is obsessed with his neighbour Helena, who he had a one night stand with once upon a time. With the recent death of his mother (whom he was equally in love with) Nick is lonely and scared. He needs someone to turn to, or love. He kidnaps Helana, amputates her limbs, and keeps her in his house as almost a pet doll. How far will this go? how long can he hide? Most of the movie takes place in the glamorous mansion which Cavanagh has inherited from his family. It is a charming place, all dressed up, and full of plush. One of the strongest and most ironic images in the movie, is seeing an armless legless girl dressed up like a porcelain doll, in a high chair, and watching the good doctor suck up to her like she is his own kin. The movie actually doesn't make it clear as to whether the Dr. Cavanagh thinks of Helena as his kin or his lover. the more emotional it tries to be, the less effective Boxing Helena becomes. The sheer sloppiness of the acting, writing and direction, are constantly reminding the viewer that this is a movie. Some of the scorning is nice, but for that, just get the soundtrack. Julian Sands' performance is a huge burden on the movie. He is over-romantic and completely unconvincing. Sands delivers his lines as if he is in Romeo and Juliet. In the last two minutes, Boxing Helena recalls David Lynch epically, as it turns into a surrealist feature, and what is more annoying is that the film has literally no ending. The whole thing just becomes an exercise in stupidity. It has nowhere to go, and subsequently, has nowhere to take the audience. Boxing Helena is best left forgotten

    When I saw Boxing Helena, I was young but pretty jaded to motion pictures. I was in a for the shock and ride of my life. Now that I read it was directed by David Lynch's daughter, it doesn't surprise me. I wont belabor the plot or details of the movie, but I will say that as a young man who was pursuing and dating lots of women, this movie really made me think about the vulnerability of even super attractive women, and about what happens when men put no constraints on their desire to chase or own a woman. The fact that it delivered that message in a totally original and effective fashion makes it a top-shelf film in my mind. I will say that I told a few women I thought it was a great film and they were disgusted by it. Too many people took this film far too literally, even though it wasn't literal even within the plot. I actually think it assaults our construction of goddesses in the media at such a root foundation that it's actually a very insurgent, anti-establishment film. It really attacks a materialism associated with the pursuit and existence of beautiful people. It's definitely a thinker's picture. It's a perfect use of film, portraying something you don't want to see in real life to illustrate a point. It's also brilliantly shot and acted. Make up you own mind. There's no other film like it.

    This thriller is one of a kind. The story is compelling and interesting. "Boxing Helena" will lure you in, and once you are caught, cut off your limbs. This is a thriller with lots of depth and detail. The characters are interesting and well cut out. Each bringing lots to the story, and you can immerse yourself in the characters, because they are so well brought to life. Of course, the cast have a lot to do with this as well, and the casting was perfect for each role. The scenery in the movie works well, because it has that touch of personal space to it. It is not scary or dark sets, and it works well for the movie. The movie is not a gory or really scary one, but it will keep you thrilled with its sense of psychological dread. The story goes forward at a constant flow, never leaving you bored. "Boxing Helena" leaves you with something to ponder about once it has ended, and I like that in a movie, that means you actually got something for your money. I recommend that you give this movie a chance if you like a movie with some depth.

    Dr. Nick ("Hi Everybody!") Cavanaugh (Julian Sands) is obsessed with the sexy but incredibly unlikable Helena (Sheryl Fenn) who he once had an affair with. When she pretty much rejects the guy, she ends up being hit by a truck. Does this deter him? No! It just means that he'll amputate her and keep her for himself. Directed by David Lynch's daughter Jennifer, "Boxing Helena" is a movie that at first sounds like a perverse, strange little movie. Instead, it ends up being more of a mix of a pretentious art house movie and a dull 90's soft-core flick (complete with Enigma's song "Sadeness" playing during a sex scene.) Worst yet, the whole thing is a mess. The acting is atrocious, with Sands playing an unlikable, uninteresting, unsympathetic and spineless man, while Fenn plays a character so bitchy that you wonder why any man would want to be with her. Even Bill Paxton (someone I normally like) is unable to lift this up any, as he is also terrible (though that's more due to the terrible script.) At least his hair is outrageously bad, though it's no match for the one Art Garfunkle (yes, THAT Art Garfunkle) has. Add a terrible ending and obvious symbolism (a bird in a cage, how clever!) to the mix, and you get a terrible movie. Little fact: While more is known about Kim Bassinger and the movie, what is less talked about is that Madonna was also offered to play Helena, but turned it down. When the star of "Swept Away", "The Next Best Thing" and "Shanghai Surprise" turns the movie down, you know you have a dud.

    I haven't read through all the comments on Boxing Helena, but I first saw this movie in '97 at the recommendation of a friend who knew my husband. It struck a very sharp cord within me because plot line aside, it very much expressed how it feels to be married to a Sociopath. The obsessiveness, ownership, and control, exactly depicted the emotions I felt. If I didn't relate to it on that level I'm not sure I would have appreciated it as much, but for anyone who wants to know what it feels like to be married to a sociopath...see this movie. If you ARE living with a sociopath...see this movie...it is very validating. BTW, we are no longer married and I have all my limbs. Marie H

    My only recommendation for seeing "Boxing Helena" is for the short scenes flaunting Nicolette Scorsese. Director Jennifer Chambers Lynch should thank me for my saying so, because upon many a heterosexual male once reading that and remembering Nicolette from her role as the gorgeous lingerie saleswoman in "Christmas Vacation", there should be a spike in "Boxing Helena" rentals/purchases. Julian Sands plays a physician who is obsessed with Sherilyn Fenn, an ex-lover. Fenn doesn't dig him too much, however. When she suffers a terrible accident, Sands goes to town with her extremities and she is left a captive at his mercy. "Boxing Helena" is depressing, uneventful, morbidly perverse in a boring sort of way, and ultimately an unmemorable waste of time. This, for me, was the turning point for Julian Sands where his career took a nose dive. In my opinion, it did little for Fenn's struggling career either, which has never seemed to completely lift off the ground.

When she pretty much rejects the guy, she ends up being hit by a truck. Does this deter him? No! It just means that he'll amputate her and keep her for himself. Directed by David Lynch's daughter Jennifer, "Boxing Helena" is a movie that at first sounds like a perverse, strange little movie. Instead, it ends up being more of a mix of a pretentious art house movie and a dull 90's soft-core flick (complete with Enigma's song "Sadeness" playing during a sex scene.) Worst yet, the whole thing is a mess. The acting is atrocious, with Sands playing an unlikable, uninteresting, unsympathetic and spineless man, while Fenn plays a character so bitchy that you wonder why any man would want to be with her. Even Bill Paxton (someone I normally like) is unable to lift this up any, as he is also terrible (though that's more due to the terrible script.) At least his hair is outrageously bad, though it's no match for the one Art Garfunkle (yes, THAT Art Garfunkle) has. Add a terrible ending and obvious symbolism (a bird in a cage, how clever!) to the mix, and you get a terrible movie. Little fact: While more is known about Kim Bassinger and the movie, what is less talked about is that Madonna was also offered to play Helena, but turned it down. When the star of "Swept Away", "The Next Best Thing" and "Shanghai Surprise" turns the movie down, you know you have a dud.

    I haven't read through all the comments on Boxing Helena, but I first saw this movie in '97 at the recommendation of a friend who knew my husband. It struck a very sharp cord within me because plot line aside, it very much expressed how it feels to be married to a Sociopath. The obsessiveness, ownership, and control, exactly depicted the emotions I felt. If I didn't relate to it on that level I'm not sure I would have appreciated it as much, but for anyone who wants to know what it feels like to be married to a sociopath...see this movie. If you ARE living with a sociopath...see this movie...it is very validating. BTW, we are no longer married and I have all my limbs. Marie H

    My only recommendation for seeing "Boxing Helena" is for the short scenes flaunting Nicolette Scorsese. Director Jennifer Chambers Lynch should thank me for my saying so, because upon many a heterosexual male once reading that and remembering Nicolette from her role as the gorgeous lingerie saleswoman in "Christmas Vacation", there should be a spike in "Boxing Helena" rentals/purchases. Julian Sands plays a physician who is obsessed with Sherilyn Fenn, an ex-lover. Fenn doesn't dig him too much, however. When she suffers a terrible accident, Sands goes to town with her extremities and she is left a captive at his mercy. "Boxing Helena" is depressing, uneventful, morbidly perverse in a boring sort of way, and ultimately an unmemorable waste of time. This, for me, was the turning point for Julian Sands where his career took a nose dive. In my opinion, it did little for Fenn's struggling career either, which has never seemed to completely lift off the ground.

    At it's core, the idea of Boxing Helena is interesting and pretty darn twisted. Knowing about it before hand was the only thing that kept me watching. It's a brave and unique premise for a movie. But it doesn't ever get good. Or shocking. From the get go the doctor comes off as odd and a little creepy. (And for some reason he's applying ear medicine and has cotton stuffed in his ear the whole movie. Why? I couldn't tell you.) His obsession with the (Needlessly?) bitchy Helena is questionable and for some reason there are scattered allusions to some kind of tainted past with his mother. About 45 minutes in, if he hadn't been set up to be so obvious, there could have been a real shock reveal when we find out what he's been up to. This movie tries, for some reason, to scatter erotica around too. There's a far too long slow motion scene where Helena gets undressed and jumps in a fountain at a party. You know, like you do. A scene from nowhere, where Dr. Nick has sex with a completely random and nameless woman to entertain Helena, who apparently reaches some kind of climax by watching this despite the fact that at this point in the movie, she can't possibly do that by herself. To top it all off it ends with - I'm not kidding you - "Oh, it was all a dream." DO NOT waste two hours on this flick, even if the plot sounds as intriguing to you as it did to me. It's a perfect example of how a good idea can be executed incredibly poorly.

    Personally i love the movie & for those lucky people that live in Atlanta or Georgia, Can see the Nick Cavanaugh Mansion which it states on here that it is Lullwater Road, Druid Hills which is wrong. The Correct Address is 3467 Castlegate DR,NW,Atlanta,GA. Sherilyn Fenn Looks Fantastic as Helena & in my opinion her best performance to date as i have seen 22 of her movies. Nick Cavanaugh is a Brilliant Atlanta Surgeon who seems to be Sexually Repressed, & one night meets the Sexy Helena & has a one night stand & falls in love with her & becomes Obsessed by her & everything she stands for. After the Death of his Mother Nick decides to keep the family mansion & throws a house warming party on the chance Helena will arrive & she does not caring for his hospitality. Once she has freshen up in his fountain she goes with one of Nicks Party Guests a fellow Surgeon for a one night stand & leaves her address book. She asks nick to bring her address book to the airport as he tricks her by coming late & so she comes to his mansion to collect, as Nick plays games with her wanting to eat & drink with her she then storms out & gets knock over by a car. Nick then has her captive in his House & amputates her injured leg & gradually finishes the job off by removing both arms & legs as a statue of sexual desire. By then belonging to him & so gradually she becomes dependant on him. A Brilliant film which does'nt get the credit it deserves the story may be daft but the point the director gets across is brilliantly shot with the fantasy dream visions of his mum is fantastic. I would love to see the movie remade.

    Close. Real close. "Boxing Helena" was so close of being good, so close of being an fine and greatly elaborated movie which flies high imagination and weirdness, with pivotal elements of a twisted cult movie. Directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch, daughter of the great David Lynch, "Boxing..." can be very enjoyable, an guilty pleasure to some or even an masterpiece to a few. To me, it was quite good until I realize it was going nowhere, completely problematic and when her speech started to fade away into a nebulous emptiness the movie was out of salvation. With a plot resembling one of Douglas Sirk melodramas but mixed with the guts of a weirdo movie, perpassing the idea of an "The Collector" (Fowles book, Wyler's film), "Boxing Helena" tells the story of a doctor (Julian Sands) so obsessed with the beautiful Helena (Sherilyn Fenn) of whom he had one night stand (but we never see that), that after an accident she suffered decides to take care of her in his house. She hates him, humiliates him but she can't go anywhere because he amputated her limbs, remaining under his care, devotion, love and obsession for 24/7. From this point on the movie evolves into a strange therapy where the doctor becomes the patient sharing (or forced to do so) his sexual insecurities with women, being analyzed by Helena the woman of his dreams and thoughts. Such transition is unexplainable, confusing, lacking in tension but filled of eroticism. The whole thing resembles an erotic film of the worst category. One can even claim to have seen soft core flicks better than this, with solid acting and far more exciting. The worst kind of criticism one can make about this film is saying that Jennifer Lynch failed to be like her father or that her work isn't so gripping like the ones the creator of "Blue Velvet" makes. Inspiration or similar sequences can be found in her work though (the opening scene for instance). She tried to find a way of her own (which is good) by created something more perverse, more melodramatic and more erotic in sensual scenes that lose their appeal very easily. Makes good use of the soundtrack (the scene where the doctor spies Helena, with Tears for Fears playing in the background) and that's the biggest achievement she controls here. What prevents "Boxing Helena" of being a good movie isn't its painful story or it's lack of imagination in having better moments. More upsetting than anything else is the bad performances from the main cast, something bad but so bad that you have to see it with your own eyes. Sands and Fenn are sexy and good to look at but boy, they do suck terribly here. Poor delivery of lines, unconvincing acting and the film editing that only made look ridiculous (the scene where he's running after seeing her with another man tops it all, is so pathetic that you wanna cover your eyes) and we feel embarrassed for them. And more embarrassing than that is seeing notable names like Bill Paxton, Kurtwood Smith and Art Garfunkel giving some good performances that go to waste in this little project. It's OK for a movie to be weird, twisted and disturbing as long as they have something plausible to say, something to see life with another perspective. Take a look at Cronenberg's "Crash", another movie about strange obsessions, fully loaded with eroticism and weird aspects to make one walk out in shock. It was a great film because it has something to show, say and it was well-acted above all. "Boxing..." only ruined itself with cheap acting, the fluency of an rotten erotic flick and with a frightening ending. One can and should aspire for more than just watching films with some hot scenes but lacking in complexity or depth of character and situations. 4/10

    ...but at least it was better than Dune. So in that one regard, and that one regard alone, the daughter of David Lynch has surpassed her father's work. The worst performance of Bill Paxton's career. Nobody in this film elicits any sympathy or even interest...other than a glancing "that guy is okay" for Art Garfunkel. I guess Kurtwood Smith did okay as well, given the absurdity of his lines and the situation his character was placed in - and the ridiculous reaction that was written for him. This thing really is a turd. Not even interesting for the sex or the horror aspect.

    Boxing Helena needs a major reworking. When it wants to, the film can be quite disturbing, I will gladly admit that. Unfortunately I also found myself laughing in places where I don't think I am supposed to. This motion picture is over serious, and completely lost. It may have some use as a pretentious psychology lesson in the Oedipal complex, but it is otherwise dull and useless, not to mention vulgar. Chief Surgeon Dr. Nick Cavanagh, is obsessed with his neighbour Helena, who he had a one night stand with once upon a time. With the recent death of his mother (whom he was equally in love with) Nick is lonely and scared. He needs someone to turn to, or love. He kidnaps Helana, amputates her limbs, and keeps her in his house as almost a pet doll. How far will this go? how long can he hide? Most of the movie takes place in the glamorous mansion which Cavanagh has inherited from his family. It is a charming place, all dressed up, and full of plush. One of the strongest and most ironic images in the movie, is seeing an armless legless girl dressed up like a porcelain doll, in a high chair, and watching the good doctor suck up to her like she is his own kin. The movie actually doesn't make it clear as to whether the Dr. Cavanagh thinks of Helena as his kin or his lover. the more emotional it tries to be, the less effective Boxing Helena becomes. The sheer sloppiness of the acting, writing and direction, are constantly reminding the viewer that this is a movie. Some of the scorning is nice, but for that, just get the soundtrack. Julian Sands' performance is a huge burden on the movie. He is over-romantic and completely unconvincing. Sands delivers his lines as if he is in Romeo and Juliet. In the last two minutes, Boxing Helena recalls David Lynch epically, as it turns into a surrealist feature, and what is more annoying is that the film has literally no ending. The whole thing just becomes an exercise in stupidity. It has nowhere to go, and subsequently, has nowhere to take the audience. Boxing Helena is best left forgotten

    When I saw Boxing Helena, I was young but pretty jaded to motion pictures. I was in a for the shock and ride of my life. Now that I read it was directed by David Lynch's daughter, it doesn't surprise me. I wont belabor the plot or details of the movie, but I will say that as a young man who was pursuing and dating lots of women, this movie really made me think about the vulnerability of even super attractive women, and about what happens when men put no constraints on their desire to chase or own a woman. The fact that it delivered that message in a totally original and effective fashion makes it a top-shelf film in my mind. I will say that I told a few women I thought it was a great film and they were disgusted by it. Too many people took this film far too literally, even though it wasn't literal even within the plot. I actually think it assaults our construction of goddesses in the media at such a root foundation that it's actually a very insurgent, anti-establishment film. It really attacks a materialism associated with the pursuit and existence of beautiful people. It's definitely a thinker's picture. It's a perfect use of film, portraying something you don't want to see in real life to illustrate a point. It's also brilliantly shot and acted. Make up you own mind. There's no other film like it.

    This thriller is one of a kind. The story is compelling and interesting. "Boxing Helena" will lure you in, and once you are caught, cut off your limbs. This is a thriller with lots of depth and detail. The characters are interesting and well cut out. Each bringing lots to the story, and you can immerse yourself in the characters, because they are so well brought to life. Of course, the cast have a lot to do with this as well, and the casting was perfect for each role. The scenery in the movie works well, because it has that touch of personal space to it. It is not scary or dark sets, and it works well for the movie. The movie is not a gory or really scary one, but it will keep you thrilled with its sense of psychological dread. The story goes forward at a constant flow, never leaving you bored. "Boxing Helena" leaves you with something to ponder about once it has ended, and I like that in a movie, that means you actually got something for your money. I recommend that you give this movie a chance if you like a movie with some depth.
