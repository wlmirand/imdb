 <storyline>
  As a young girl in Japan, Nagiko's father paints characters on her face, and her aunt reads to her from "The Pillow Book", the diary of a 10th-century lady-in-waiting. Nagiko grows up, obsessed with books, papers, and writing on bodies, and her sexual odyssey (and the creation of her own Pillow Book) is a "parfait m&eacute;lange" of classical Japanese, modern Chinese, and Western film images.

    The pillow book is 1,000 year old Asian journal of ancient philosophical writings. A six year old girl is read to by her mother from the pillow book and is told by her father to begin a diary of her own. Nagiko(Vivian Wu) is constantly having calligraphy done in ink, first on her face, then on her body. She is obsessed with having artists write on her skin and she draws her feelings on others. Peter Greenaway's use of picture in picture images is a distracting device and the plot is fairly simplistic with Nagiko's search for partners willing to use her body as a canvas, even to the point of having the "Our Father" drawn onto her arm, chest and stomach; this is a very off-beat tale which features frequent nudity, both male and female. Greenaway's eye for images is sharp but the film is repetitive and needed to be shortened by at least 15 or 20 minutes. Vivian Wu is beautiful as Nagiko, the lead character and Ewan McGregor is always good.

    The thing about cinema in general, a Western invention and as such shaped by Western thinking, is that it is often too specific, about physical action revealing a moral understanding. The insight is shortsighted. To abstract as all the great filmmakers known to us have done, is to transplant that specific experience into the center from where all creative energy emanates. The Japanese (tracing it back to China) had mastered this centuries ago. It's a culture that revolves around form rather than narrative. Whereas our drama is often hysterical, theirs is subdued and sublimated into abstraction. Their abstraction is in the best possible way about a perfect centeredness. Flowing from and returning to a center. Flowing outwards into form and once replenished there, returning with wisdom about the emptiness of form (and joy that the form is only a mask). Their compositions (painted, written, or later filmed) are clean and sparse, signifying the vitally empty as a dynamic process. Thus every utterance in form, say by the calligrapher's brush, perfectly radiates with that transcendence of opposites - the vital and the empty are one. There is no confusion or agitation that comes from attachment, that's the idea at least. The thing about Greenaway is that he's aiming for a similar transcendence, but through an effort of loading forms until they break to reveal. When he fills his films with lists and lists about books, our constricted knowledge of the world and how it limits, it is always with the intent of transcending them. It is always about the creative process as a means of reaching beyond the list. Prospero's Books reaches there, arguably however the work was already laid out for him by Shakespeare. Here he tackles a subject that is completely alien to Greenaway logic. It is about a young Japanese woman doggedly looking to find a man who is both a lover and a calligrapher. Who can write beautifully on her naked body. The film specific idea chimes with the heart of the abstraction; inner expression expressed in visible form, with in our case the naked body as a perfect blank paper. And that expression in form brought by its author literally to life. There is not much to say on the subject outside the depiction. The very act communicates all. So that leaves the rest of the film a series of beautiful tableaux about bodies, naked or not, painted or not, and calligraphic backdrops of various kinds. Eventually it is again about books, human books each with its own message, where thought is exorcised so that it can be replenished again. Having emptied herself of all the accumulations of her past, by the end she is free to write her own 'pillow book'. She can sign her own name. As usually with Greenaway, everything is also about him creating his own film. Maybe because he's done this kind of thing for so long that it has lost its novelty, maybe because his style to overload is in stark contrast with the vital emptiness the subject demands, the film seems to be missing something. Prospero's Books was closer to his sensibility and as such a more rewarding film (if also more oblique and difficult).

    Miller Analogy Test: Occasionally cold is to Antarctica as Occasionally obsessional is to Peter Greenaway. This film goes way beyond being a study in art form and the blending of body and calligraphy -- the detour into Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder-land morphs into a permanent trip to the insane asylum. Let's consider the repetitive elements: Body calligraphy starting from the first scene that reoccurs year by year, and later in more modern life, day-by-day; the picture-in-picture techniques; the subtitled translations; the various books that appear in many guises. This is fractal film making where the larger image is actually repeated copies in ever smaller form without boundaries, without any consideration outside of art, form, and the pure expression of sensuality (in all senses, but particularly vision and touch). // I suspect I'm one of the few people giving this movie a mid-rating. Except to observe a tour-de-force of a singular obsession, I can't imagine why one would voluntarily see the whole movie.

    Ewan McGregor, playing an English translator in Hong Kong, has a love affair with a Japanese woman with a very curious fetish: writing in fine Japanese calligraphy the body of her lovers. Sex and literature can be a good combination, but not if the chef is Peter Greenaway (The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover). The movie is very silly, but is sort of watchable (the obvious beauty of Vivian Wu, who plays the Japanese lover and appears naked several times - as does McGregor - certainly helps). This was the last film of Greenaway to have some sort of commercial impact. After that, he made the awful 8 1/2 Women and then retreated to the art world (where he probably feels more comfortable).

    This film is about a Japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on skin. The plot is absolutely bizarre. I fail to see any "sensual" or "erotic" undertones. The plot turns an ancient art form into a fetishistic pornography. In addition, the scenes that are filmed in Hong Kong are certainly portraying bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the airport in the middle of the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the whole film, I keep thinking that "The Pillow Book" is insulting the Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment. "The Pillow Book" is a perverted, yet boring film. Seriously stay away from it.

    After the completion of Prospero's Books in 1991, Greenaway was quoted in an article on IMDb as saying: "I'm pretty certain Michael and I will never ever work together again." After making a few films with various composers after his breakup with Nyman, Greenaway made a major attempt at creating a sound track from existing music, and the outstanding results are the music of The Pillow Book. Chosen with great care, the music is a document to his outstanding sense of taste, and reflects a very high level of musical awareness. In each scene, the music supports the drama to the fullest: observe the corny pop song that recalls Nagiko's parents early years; or the silly socialist workers song, lacking in all things sophisticated; or the extremely beautiful French love song that is heard when the lovers are together; or the violent avant-garde string quartet music used first for the fire scene, and later when Jerome commits suicide. Greenway's choice of soundtrack here is every bit as outstanding as that of Stanly Kubrick, which reflects the finest taste of any 20th-century director. (Greenway's choice of music here is as keen as Kubrick's choice of music in Eyes Wide Shut, etc.). As such, The Pillow Book does not have the tight neo-classic aura that we find in Greenaways films with music by Nyman. It is actually quite different, and we miss the unique relationship the two presented in so many masterworks. Never-the-less, what Greenaway has come up with here is excellent in its own way, and although it has taken the director in a new direction, it is still of a very high quality.

    I really wanted to like The Pillow Book. Intriguing story, interesting character outlines, Ewan Macgregor in the utterly glorious altogether. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of it. Greenaway got so enamoured with presenting the movie uniquely, and not to the film's benefit. I won't even get into Vivian Wu's abysmal acting. You get distracted from the story with 4 billion teeny windows and calligraphy that rolls on the bottom of the screen displaying the lyrics of the music that's playing. It seems he lost sight of presenting the actual story and developing the plot, and got entangled with foo-foo embellishments that have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like presenting a John Singer Sargeant portrait in a chintzy Hallmark frame that says "GRANDMA LOVES ME!" in big sparkly letters. This movie seems to be a casualty of the director auteur's ego instead of what it could have been - disturbingly and horrifyingly beautiful. In another director's hands (Jeunet? Coppola?), it could have been a masterpiece. In Greenaway's hands, it's best relegated to fine arts classes that also take themselves too seriously.

    I'm not even completely sure how I came across this film - it was either on the internet somewhere, or by sheer coincidence. But I definitely do not regret putting my two hours into it. I gave The Pillow Book a 9 out 10, simply because the director tried a little too hard with the picture-in-picture thing. Sometimes simultaneously watching two different, sometimes three different scenes at once, got a little chaotic and tiring. But more than that, it eventually just became annoying, and slightly irritated me a bit by the end. It definitely wasn't enough to take away from the film itself, though, it especially did not alter the plot in any way, shape, or form. A minor annoyance, that was meant to be artistic, but was eventually a little over-done in my own, personal opinion, while watching the film. I won't go into much detail of the plot, as countless other comments have already done so, but I will say this: I was a little lost at certain parts of this movie, and I'm not usually one to say that often. One of the parts was a very important scene in the film, that has a whole lot to do with everything, in the end. The scene I'm talking about is when the main character's father is being forced to have homosexual relations with his publisher in order to get his things published. When this was shown, it was just a little peek into the room, and I, for whatever reason, did not pick up on what was going on. Soon enough, the scene ended, another began, and I continued on my merry little way throughout the film, completely oblivious to the importance of that scene. There were a couple other, maybe 1 or 2, parts where I stopped and thought, "Wait, what?", but continued on, but they were so few, and much less important than that first one. So, do not be afraid of stopping the movie for a second, or rewinding it, if you are a little confused. At some points you're supposed to be confused, but others, you're not. I will admit that while my first run through this film, had I not finished it yet and was only a little bit before halfway through it, I would have probably given it a 6/10, maybe 7/10. It, at times, although I hate to admit it now, became a little boring to me. Some parts just did not make sense, and the little picture-in-picture was beginning to get to me some. But, I urge you all to stick with it, as it DOES get better! And it is completely worth your time in the end. There's no way I would regret spending two hours of my time for this film now, and I would love to see it again, though in a reasonable space of time. It's not exactly a movie you'd see once, and then go see again one or two days later since you loved it. It's more like you loved it still, but you should watch it with big time intervals inbetween. You'll forget the little details, and then, once immersed to it again, it will seem all the more pleasantly erotic and interesting. The tale even has a darker side to things towards the end, which was a bit of a surprise for me. Bottom line, I recommend this film to anyone who is open minded, mature, and has an interest in seeing and learning about new cultural experiences.

    Inventive and most original, full of arresting images and unpredictable developments, this flick has one fatal flaw. The whole progression of the story is predicated on the character Nagiko's obsessive power over others. One would have to have the beauty and fascination of ten Mata Haris to carry off this woman's singular willfulness. But the actress who impersonates Nagiko has none of that. She is a reasonably pretty female with little or no personal magnetism that one can discern. Her high-pitched voice and peevish, juvenile enunciation of the English language are singularly irritating. At one point she is called by the script to scream out the name Jerome a dozen times (she pronounces it "J'roam"): she sounds like a hysterical high school student, or perhaps a dental assistant whose finger has been drilled through. As a result of this flaw, the spectator is bewildered by the sight of two dozen men running around feverishly trying to execute this woman's whims. It makes nonsense of the whole situation. Ewan McGregor is sweet and charismatic (and lovely to look at) as the much screamed about Jeromeone wonders what did he ever see in the aggravating Nagiko.

    I voted 3 for this movie because it looks great as does all of Greenaways output. However it was his usual mix of "art" sex and pretentious crap.I know lots of people like this film but I grew tired of it VERY quickly. It is definitely not for everyone. The ubiquitous McGregor obviously took the part for crediblity's sake I guess but he really should not have wasted his time. I hate to consign anyone to pseud's corner but please.....!!! On the plus side it IS visually very attractive and I enjoyed the music but could not see it through to the end and I cannot say that for many movies. I usually watch the whole thing but this is unbearable!!

There were a couple other, maybe 1 or 2, parts where I stopped and thought, "Wait, what?", but continued on, but they were so few, and much less important than that first one. So, do not be afraid of stopping the movie for a second, or rewinding it, if you are a little confused. At some points you're supposed to be confused, but others, you're not. I will admit that while my first run through this film, had I not finished it yet and was only a little bit before halfway through it, I would have probably given it a 6/10, maybe 7/10. It, at times, although I hate to admit it now, became a little boring to me. Some parts just did not make sense, and the little picture-in-picture was beginning to get to me some. But, I urge you all to stick with it, as it DOES get better! And it is completely worth your time in the end. There's no way I would regret spending two hours of my time for this film now, and I would love to see it again, though in a reasonable space of time. It's not exactly a movie you'd see once, and then go see again one or two days later since you loved it. It's more like you loved it still, but you should watch it with big time intervals inbetween. You'll forget the little details, and then, once immersed to it again, it will seem all the more pleasantly erotic and interesting. The tale even has a darker side to things towards the end, which was a bit of a surprise for me. Bottom line, I recommend this film to anyone who is open minded, mature, and has an interest in seeing and learning about new cultural experiences.

    Inventive and most original, full of arresting images and unpredictable developments, this flick has one fatal flaw. The whole progression of the story is predicated on the character Nagiko's obsessive power over others. One would have to have the beauty and fascination of ten Mata Haris to carry off this woman's singular willfulness. But the actress who impersonates Nagiko has none of that. She is a reasonably pretty female with little or no personal magnetism that one can discern. Her high-pitched voice and peevish, juvenile enunciation of the English language are singularly irritating. At one point she is called by the script to scream out the name Jerome a dozen times (she pronounces it "J'roam"): she sounds like a hysterical high school student, or perhaps a dental assistant whose finger has been drilled through. As a result of this flaw, the spectator is bewildered by the sight of two dozen men running around feverishly trying to execute this woman's whims. It makes nonsense of the whole situation. Ewan McGregor is sweet and charismatic (and lovely to look at) as the much screamed about Jeromeone wonders what did he ever see in the aggravating Nagiko.

    I voted 3 for this movie because it looks great as does all of Greenaways output. However it was his usual mix of "art" sex and pretentious crap.I know lots of people like this film but I grew tired of it VERY quickly. It is definitely not for everyone. The ubiquitous McGregor obviously took the part for crediblity's sake I guess but he really should not have wasted his time. I hate to consign anyone to pseud's corner but please.....!!! On the plus side it IS visually very attractive and I enjoyed the music but could not see it through to the end and I cannot say that for many movies. I usually watch the whole thing but this is unbearable!!

    The pillow book is 1,000 year old Asian journal of ancient philosophical writings. A six year old girl is read to by her mother from the pillow book and is told by her father to begin a diary of her own. Nagiko(Vivian Wu) is constantly having calligraphy done in ink, first on her face, then on her body. She is obsessed with having artists write on her skin and she draws her feelings on others. Peter Greenaway's use of picture in picture images is a distracting device and the plot is fairly simplistic with Nagiko's search for partners willing to use her body as a canvas, even to the point of having the "Our Father" drawn onto her arm, chest and stomach; this is a very off-beat tale which features frequent nudity, both male and female. Greenaway's eye for images is sharp but the film is repetitive and needed to be shortened by at least 15 or 20 minutes. Vivian Wu is beautiful as Nagiko, the lead character and Ewan McGregor is always good.

    The thing about cinema in general, a Western invention and as such shaped by Western thinking, is that it is often too specific, about physical action revealing a moral understanding. The insight is shortsighted. To abstract as all the great filmmakers known to us have done, is to transplant that specific experience into the center from where all creative energy emanates. The Japanese (tracing it back to China) had mastered this centuries ago. It's a culture that revolves around form rather than narrative. Whereas our drama is often hysterical, theirs is subdued and sublimated into abstraction. Their abstraction is in the best possible way about a perfect centeredness. Flowing from and returning to a center. Flowing outwards into form and once replenished there, returning with wisdom about the emptiness of form (and joy that the form is only a mask). Their compositions (painted, written, or later filmed) are clean and sparse, signifying the vitally empty as a dynamic process. Thus every utterance in form, say by the calligrapher's brush, perfectly radiates with that transcendence of opposites - the vital and the empty are one. There is no confusion or agitation that comes from attachment, that's the idea at least. The thing about Greenaway is that he's aiming for a similar transcendence, but through an effort of loading forms until they break to reveal. When he fills his films with lists and lists about books, our constricted knowledge of the world and how it limits, it is always with the intent of transcending them. It is always about the creative process as a means of reaching beyond the list. Prospero's Books reaches there, arguably however the work was already laid out for him by Shakespeare. Here he tackles a subject that is completely alien to Greenaway logic. It is about a young Japanese woman doggedly looking to find a man who is both a lover and a calligrapher. Who can write beautifully on her naked body. The film specific idea chimes with the heart of the abstraction; inner expression expressed in visible form, with in our case the naked body as a perfect blank paper. And that expression in form brought by its author literally to life. There is not much to say on the subject outside the depiction. The very act communicates all. So that leaves the rest of the film a series of beautiful tableaux about bodies, naked or not, painted or not, and calligraphic backdrops of various kinds. Eventually it is again about books, human books each with its own message, where thought is exorcised so that it can be replenished again. Having emptied herself of all the accumulations of her past, by the end she is free to write her own 'pillow book'. She can sign her own name. As usually with Greenaway, everything is also about him creating his own film. Maybe because he's done this kind of thing for so long that it has lost its novelty, maybe because his style to overload is in stark contrast with the vital emptiness the subject demands, the film seems to be missing something. Prospero's Books was closer to his sensibility and as such a more rewarding film (if also more oblique and difficult).

    Miller Analogy Test: Occasionally cold is to Antarctica as Occasionally obsessional is to Peter Greenaway. This film goes way beyond being a study in art form and the blending of body and calligraphy -- the detour into Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder-land morphs into a permanent trip to the insane asylum. Let's consider the repetitive elements: Body calligraphy starting from the first scene that reoccurs year by year, and later in more modern life, day-by-day; the picture-in-picture techniques; the subtitled translations; the various books that appear in many guises. This is fractal film making where the larger image is actually repeated copies in ever smaller form without boundaries, without any consideration outside of art, form, and the pure expression of sensuality (in all senses, but particularly vision and touch). // I suspect I'm one of the few people giving this movie a mid-rating. Except to observe a tour-de-force of a singular obsession, I can't imagine why one would voluntarily see the whole movie.

    Ewan McGregor, playing an English translator in Hong Kong, has a love affair with a Japanese woman with a very curious fetish: writing in fine Japanese calligraphy the body of her lovers. Sex and literature can be a good combination, but not if the chef is Peter Greenaway (The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover). The movie is very silly, but is sort of watchable (the obvious beauty of Vivian Wu, who plays the Japanese lover and appears naked several times - as does McGregor - certainly helps). This was the last film of Greenaway to have some sort of commercial impact. After that, he made the awful 8 1/2 Women and then retreated to the art world (where he probably feels more comfortable).

    This film is about a Japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on skin. The plot is absolutely bizarre. I fail to see any "sensual" or "erotic" undertones. The plot turns an ancient art form into a fetishistic pornography. In addition, the scenes that are filmed in Hong Kong are certainly portraying bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the airport in the middle of the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the whole film, I keep thinking that "The Pillow Book" is insulting the Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment. "The Pillow Book" is a perverted, yet boring film. Seriously stay away from it.

    After the completion of Prospero's Books in 1991, Greenaway was quoted in an article on IMDb as saying: "I'm pretty certain Michael and I will never ever work together again." After making a few films with various composers after his breakup with Nyman, Greenaway made a major attempt at creating a sound track from existing music, and the outstanding results are the music of The Pillow Book. Chosen with great care, the music is a document to his outstanding sense of taste, and reflects a very high level of musical awareness. In each scene, the music supports the drama to the fullest: observe the corny pop song that recalls Nagiko's parents early years; or the silly socialist workers song, lacking in all things sophisticated; or the extremely beautiful French love song that is heard when the lovers are together; or the violent avant-garde string quartet music used first for the fire scene, and later when Jerome commits suicide. Greenway's choice of soundtrack here is every bit as outstanding as that of Stanly Kubrick, which reflects the finest taste of any 20th-century director. (Greenway's choice of music here is as keen as Kubrick's choice of music in Eyes Wide Shut, etc.). As such, The Pillow Book does not have the tight neo-classic aura that we find in Greenaways films with music by Nyman. It is actually quite different, and we miss the unique relationship the two presented in so many masterworks. Never-the-less, what Greenaway has come up with here is excellent in its own way, and although it has taken the director in a new direction, it is still of a very high quality.

    I really wanted to like The Pillow Book. Intriguing story, interesting character outlines, Ewan Macgregor in the utterly glorious altogether. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of it. Greenaway got so enamoured with presenting the movie uniquely, and not to the film's benefit. I won't even get into Vivian Wu's abysmal acting. You get distracted from the story with 4 billion teeny windows and calligraphy that rolls on the bottom of the screen displaying the lyrics of the music that's playing. It seems he lost sight of presenting the actual story and developing the plot, and got entangled with foo-foo embellishments that have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like presenting a John Singer Sargeant portrait in a chintzy Hallmark frame that says "GRANDMA LOVES ME!" in big sparkly letters. This movie seems to be a casualty of the director auteur's ego instead of what it could have been - disturbingly and horrifyingly beautiful. In another director's hands (Jeunet? Coppola?), it could have been a masterpiece. In Greenaway's hands, it's best relegated to fine arts classes that also take themselves too seriously.

    I'm not even completely sure how I came across this film - it was either on the internet somewhere, or by sheer coincidence. But I definitely do not regret putting my two hours into it. I gave The Pillow Book a 9 out 10, simply because the director tried a little too hard with the picture-in-picture thing. Sometimes simultaneously watching two different, sometimes three different scenes at once, got a little chaotic and tiring. But more than that, it eventually just became annoying, and slightly irritated me a bit by the end. It definitely wasn't enough to take away from the film itself, though, it especially did not alter the plot in any way, shape, or form. A minor annoyance, that was meant to be artistic, but was eventually a little over-done in my own, personal opinion, while watching the film. I won't go into much detail of the plot, as countless other comments have already done so, but I will say this: I was a little lost at certain parts of this movie, and I'm not usually one to say that often. One of the parts was a very important scene in the film, that has a whole lot to do with everything, in the end. The scene I'm talking about is when the main character's father is being forced to have homosexual relations with his publisher in order to get his things published. When this was shown, it was just a little peek into the room, and I, for whatever reason, did not pick up on what was going on. Soon enough, the scene ended, another began, and I continued on my merry little way throughout the film, completely oblivious to the importance of that scene. There were a couple other, maybe 1 or 2, parts where I stopped and thought, "Wait, what?", but continued on, but they were so few, and much less important than that first one. So, do not be afraid of stopping the movie for a second, or rewinding it, if you are a little confused. At some points you're supposed to be confused, but others, you're not. I will admit that while my first run through this film, had I not finished it yet and was only a little bit before halfway through it, I would have probably given it a 6/10, maybe 7/10. It, at times, although I hate to admit it now, became a little boring to me. Some parts just did not make sense, and the little picture-in-picture was beginning to get to me some. But, I urge you all to stick with it, as it DOES get better! And it is completely worth your time in the end.

It's not exactly a movie you'd see once, and then go see again one or two days later since you loved it. It's more like you loved it still, but you should watch it with big time intervals inbetween. You'll forget the little details, and then, once immersed to it again, it will seem all the more pleasantly erotic and interesting. The tale even has a darker side to things towards the end, which was a bit of a surprise for me. Bottom line, I recommend this film to anyone who is open minded, mature, and has an interest in seeing and learning about new cultural experiences.

    I'm not even completely sure how I came across this film - it was either on the internet somewhere, or by sheer coincidence. But I definitely do not regret putting my two hours into it. I gave The Pillow Book a 9 out 10, simply because the director tried a little too hard with the picture-in-picture thing. Sometimes simultaneously watching two different, sometimes three different scenes at once, got a little chaotic and tiring. But more than that, it eventually just became annoying, and slightly irritated me a bit by the end. It definitely wasn't enough to take away from the film itself, though, it especially did not alter the plot in any way, shape, or form. A minor annoyance, that was meant to be artistic, but was eventually a little over-done in my own, personal opinion, while watching the film. I won't go into much detail of the plot, as countless other comments have already done so, but I will say this: I was a little lost at certain parts of this movie, and I'm not usually one to say that often. One of the parts was a very important scene in the film, that has a whole lot to do with everything, in the end. The scene I'm talking about is when the main character's father is being forced to have homosexual relations with his publisher in order to get his things published. When this was shown, it was just a little peek into the room, and I, for whatever reason, did not pick up on what was going on. Soon enough, the scene ended, another began, and I continued on my merry little way throughout the film, completely oblivious to the importance of that scene. There were a couple other, maybe 1 or 2, parts where I stopped and thought, "Wait, what?", but continued on, but they were so few, and much less important than that first one. So, do not be afraid of stopping the movie for a second, or rewinding it, if you are a little confused. At some points you're supposed to be confused, but others, you're not. I will admit that while my first run through this film, had I not finished it yet and was only a little bit before halfway through it, I would have probably given it a 6/10, maybe 7/10. It, at times, although I hate to admit it now, became a little boring to me. Some parts just did not make sense, and the little picture-in-picture was beginning to get to me some. But, I urge you all to stick with it, as it DOES get better! And it is completely worth your time in the end. There's no way I would regret spending two hours of my time for this film now, and I would love to see it again, though in a reasonable space of time. It's not exactly a movie you'd see once, and then go see again one or two days later since you loved it. It's more like you loved it still, but you should watch it with big time intervals inbetween. You'll forget the little details, and then, once immersed to it again, it will seem all the more pleasantly erotic and interesting. The tale even has a darker side to things towards the end, which was a bit of a surprise for me. Bottom line, I recommend this film to anyone who is open minded, mature, and has an interest in seeing and learning about new cultural experiences.

    Inventive and most original, full of arresting images and unpredictable developments, this flick has one fatal flaw. The whole progression of the story is predicated on the character Nagiko's obsessive power over others. One would have to have the beauty and fascination of ten Mata Haris to carry off this woman's singular willfulness. But the actress who impersonates Nagiko has none of that. She is a reasonably pretty female with little or no personal magnetism that one can discern. Her high-pitched voice and peevish, juvenile enunciation of the English language are singularly irritating. At one point she is called by the script to scream out the name Jerome a dozen times (she pronounces it "J'roam"): she sounds like a hysterical high school student, or perhaps a dental assistant whose finger has been drilled through. As a result of this flaw, the spectator is bewildered by the sight of two dozen men running around feverishly trying to execute this woman's whims. It makes nonsense of the whole situation. Ewan McGregor is sweet and charismatic (and lovely to look at) as the much screamed about Jeromeone wonders what did he ever see in the aggravating Nagiko.

    I voted 3 for this movie because it looks great as does all of Greenaways output. However it was his usual mix of "art" sex and pretentious crap.I know lots of people like this film but I grew tired of it VERY quickly. It is definitely not for everyone. The ubiquitous McGregor obviously took the part for crediblity's sake I guess but he really should not have wasted his time. I hate to consign anyone to pseud's corner but please.....!!! On the plus side it IS visually very attractive and I enjoyed the music but could not see it through to the end and I cannot say that for many movies. I usually watch the whole thing but this is unbearable!!

    The pillow book is 1,000 year old Asian journal of ancient philosophical writings. A six year old girl is read to by her mother from the pillow book and is told by her father to begin a diary of her own. Nagiko(Vivian Wu) is constantly having calligraphy done in ink, first on her face, then on her body. She is obsessed with having artists write on her skin and she draws her feelings on others. Peter Greenaway's use of picture in picture images is a distracting device and the plot is fairly simplistic with Nagiko's search for partners willing to use her body as a canvas, even to the point of having the "Our Father" drawn onto her arm, chest and stomach; this is a very off-beat tale which features frequent nudity, both male and female. Greenaway's eye for images is sharp but the film is repetitive and needed to be shortened by at least 15 or 20 minutes. Vivian Wu is beautiful as Nagiko, the lead character and Ewan McGregor is always good.

    The thing about cinema in general, a Western invention and as such shaped by Western thinking, is that it is often too specific, about physical action revealing a moral understanding. The insight is shortsighted. To abstract as all the great filmmakers known to us have done, is to transplant that specific experience into the center from where all creative energy emanates. The Japanese (tracing it back to China) had mastered this centuries ago. It's a culture that revolves around form rather than narrative. Whereas our drama is often hysterical, theirs is subdued and sublimated into abstraction. Their abstraction is in the best possible way about a perfect centeredness. Flowing from and returning to a center. Flowing outwards into form and once replenished there, returning with wisdom about the emptiness of form (and joy that the form is only a mask). Their compositions (painted, written, or later filmed) are clean and sparse, signifying the vitally empty as a dynamic process. Thus every utterance in form, say by the calligrapher's brush, perfectly radiates with that transcendence of opposites - the vital and the empty are one. There is no confusion or agitation that comes from attachment, that's the idea at least. The thing about Greenaway is that he's aiming for a similar transcendence, but through an effort of loading forms until they break to reveal. When he fills his films with lists and lists about books, our constricted knowledge of the world and how it limits, it is always with the intent of transcending them. It is always about the creative process as a means of reaching beyond the list. Prospero's Books reaches there, arguably however the work was already laid out for him by Shakespeare. Here he tackles a subject that is completely alien to Greenaway logic. It is about a young Japanese woman doggedly looking to find a man who is both a lover and a calligrapher. Who can write beautifully on her naked body. The film specific idea chimes with the heart of the abstraction; inner expression expressed in visible form, with in our case the naked body as a perfect blank paper. And that expression in form brought by its author literally to life. There is not much to say on the subject outside the depiction. The very act communicates all. So that leaves the rest of the film a series of beautiful tableaux about bodies, naked or not, painted or not, and calligraphic backdrops of various kinds. Eventually it is again about books, human books each with its own message, where thought is exorcised so that it can be replenished again. Having emptied herself of all the accumulations of her past, by the end she is free to write her own 'pillow book'. She can sign her own name. As usually with Greenaway, everything is also about him creating his own film. Maybe because he's done this kind of thing for so long that it has lost its novelty, maybe because his style to overload is in stark contrast with the vital emptiness the subject demands, the film seems to be missing something. Prospero's Books was closer to his sensibility and as such a more rewarding film (if also more oblique and difficult).

    Miller Analogy Test: Occasionally cold is to Antarctica as Occasionally obsessional is to Peter Greenaway. This film goes way beyond being a study in art form and the blending of body and calligraphy -- the detour into Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder-land morphs into a permanent trip to the insane asylum. Let's consider the repetitive elements: Body calligraphy starting from the first scene that reoccurs year by year, and later in more modern life, day-by-day; the picture-in-picture techniques; the subtitled translations; the various books that appear in many guises. This is fractal film making where the larger image is actually repeated copies in ever smaller form without boundaries, without any consideration outside of art, form, and the pure expression of sensuality (in all senses, but particularly vision and touch). // I suspect I'm one of the few people giving this movie a mid-rating. Except to observe a tour-de-force of a singular obsession, I can't imagine why one would voluntarily see the whole movie.

    Ewan McGregor, playing an English translator in Hong Kong, has a love affair with a Japanese woman with a very curious fetish: writing in fine Japanese calligraphy the body of her lovers. Sex and literature can be a good combination, but not if the chef is Peter Greenaway (The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover). The movie is very silly, but is sort of watchable (the obvious beauty of Vivian Wu, who plays the Japanese lover and appears naked several times - as does McGregor - certainly helps). This was the last film of Greenaway to have some sort of commercial impact. After that, he made the awful 8 1/2 Women and then retreated to the art world (where he probably feels more comfortable).

    This film is about a Japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on skin. The plot is absolutely bizarre. I fail to see any "sensual" or "erotic" undertones. The plot turns an ancient art form into a fetishistic pornography. In addition, the scenes that are filmed in Hong Kong are certainly portraying bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the airport in the middle of the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the whole film, I keep thinking that "The Pillow Book" is insulting the Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment. "The Pillow Book" is a perverted, yet boring film. Seriously stay away from it.

    After the completion of Prospero's Books in 1991, Greenaway was quoted in an article on IMDb as saying: "I'm pretty certain Michael and I will never ever work together again." After making a few films with various composers after his breakup with Nyman, Greenaway made a major attempt at creating a sound track from existing music, and the outstanding results are the music of The Pillow Book. Chosen with great care, the music is a document to his outstanding sense of taste, and reflects a very high level of musical awareness. In each scene, the music supports the drama to the fullest: observe the corny pop song that recalls Nagiko's parents early years; or the silly socialist workers song, lacking in all things sophisticated; or the extremely beautiful French love song that is heard when the lovers are together; or the violent avant-garde string quartet music used first for the fire scene, and later when Jerome commits suicide. Greenway's choice of soundtrack here is every bit as outstanding as that of Stanly Kubrick, which reflects the finest taste of any 20th-century director. (Greenway's choice of music here is as keen as Kubrick's choice of music in Eyes Wide Shut, etc.). As such, The Pillow Book does not have the tight neo-classic aura that we find in Greenaways films with music by Nyman. It is actually quite different, and we miss the unique relationship the two presented in so many masterworks. Never-the-less, what Greenaway has come up with here is excellent in its own way, and although it has taken the director in a new direction, it is still of a very high quality.

    I really wanted to like The Pillow Book. Intriguing story, interesting character outlines, Ewan Macgregor in the utterly glorious altogether. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of it. Greenaway got so enamoured with presenting the movie uniquely, and not to the film's benefit. I won't even get into Vivian Wu's abysmal acting. You get distracted from the story with 4 billion teeny windows and calligraphy that rolls on the bottom of the screen displaying the lyrics of the music that's playing. It seems he lost sight of presenting the actual story and developing the plot, and got entangled with foo-foo embellishments that have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like presenting a John Singer Sargeant portrait in a chintzy Hallmark frame that says "GRANDMA LOVES ME!" in big sparkly letters. This movie seems to be a casualty of the director auteur's ego instead of what it could have been - disturbingly and horrifyingly beautiful. In another director's hands (Jeunet? Coppola?), it could have been a masterpiece. In Greenaway's hands, it's best relegated to fine arts classes that also take themselves too seriously.

As such, The Pillow Book does not have the tight neo-classic aura that we find in Greenaways films with music by Nyman. It is actually quite different, and we miss the unique relationship the two presented in so many masterworks. Never-the-less, what Greenaway has come up with here is excellent in its own way, and although it has taken the director in a new direction, it is still of a very high quality.

    I really wanted to like The Pillow Book. Intriguing story, interesting character outlines, Ewan Macgregor in the utterly glorious altogether. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of it. Greenaway got so enamoured with presenting the movie uniquely, and not to the film's benefit. I won't even get into Vivian Wu's abysmal acting. You get distracted from the story with 4 billion teeny windows and calligraphy that rolls on the bottom of the screen displaying the lyrics of the music that's playing. It seems he lost sight of presenting the actual story and developing the plot, and got entangled with foo-foo embellishments that have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like presenting a John Singer Sargeant portrait in a chintzy Hallmark frame that says "GRANDMA LOVES ME!" in big sparkly letters. This movie seems to be a casualty of the director auteur's ego instead of what it could have been - disturbingly and horrifyingly beautiful. In another director's hands (Jeunet? Coppola?), it could have been a masterpiece. In Greenaway's hands, it's best relegated to fine arts classes that also take themselves too seriously.

    I'm not even completely sure how I came across this film - it was either on the internet somewhere, or by sheer coincidence. But I definitely do not regret putting my two hours into it. I gave The Pillow Book a 9 out 10, simply because the director tried a little too hard with the picture-in-picture thing. Sometimes simultaneously watching two different, sometimes three different scenes at once, got a little chaotic and tiring. But more than that, it eventually just became annoying, and slightly irritated me a bit by the end. It definitely wasn't enough to take away from the film itself, though, it especially did not alter the plot in any way, shape, or form. A minor annoyance, that was meant to be artistic, but was eventually a little over-done in my own, personal opinion, while watching the film. I won't go into much detail of the plot, as countless other comments have already done so, but I will say this: I was a little lost at certain parts of this movie, and I'm not usually one to say that often. One of the parts was a very important scene in the film, that has a whole lot to do with everything, in the end. The scene I'm talking about is when the main character's father is being forced to have homosexual relations with his publisher in order to get his things published. When this was shown, it was just a little peek into the room, and I, for whatever reason, did not pick up on what was going on. Soon enough, the scene ended, another began, and I continued on my merry little way throughout the film, completely oblivious to the importance of that scene. There were a couple other, maybe 1 or 2, parts where I stopped and thought, "Wait, what?", but continued on, but they were so few, and much less important than that first one. So, do not be afraid of stopping the movie for a second, or rewinding it, if you are a little confused. At some points you're supposed to be confused, but others, you're not. I will admit that while my first run through this film, had I not finished it yet and was only a little bit before halfway through it, I would have probably given it a 6/10, maybe 7/10. It, at times, although I hate to admit it now, became a little boring to me. Some parts just did not make sense, and the little picture-in-picture was beginning to get to me some. But, I urge you all to stick with it, as it DOES get better! And it is completely worth your time in the end. There's no way I would regret spending two hours of my time for this film now, and I would love to see it again, though in a reasonable space of time. It's not exactly a movie you'd see once, and then go see again one or two days later since you loved it. It's more like you loved it still, but you should watch it with big time intervals inbetween. You'll forget the little details, and then, once immersed to it again, it will seem all the more pleasantly erotic and interesting. The tale even has a darker side to things towards the end, which was a bit of a surprise for me. Bottom line, I recommend this film to anyone who is open minded, mature, and has an interest in seeing and learning about new cultural experiences.

    Inventive and most original, full of arresting images and unpredictable developments, this flick has one fatal flaw. The whole progression of the story is predicated on the character Nagiko's obsessive power over others. One would have to have the beauty and fascination of ten Mata Haris to carry off this woman's singular willfulness. But the actress who impersonates Nagiko has none of that. She is a reasonably pretty female with little or no personal magnetism that one can discern. Her high-pitched voice and peevish, juvenile enunciation of the English language are singularly irritating. At one point she is called by the script to scream out the name Jerome a dozen times (she pronounces it "J'roam"): she sounds like a hysterical high school student, or perhaps a dental assistant whose finger has been drilled through. As a result of this flaw, the spectator is bewildered by the sight of two dozen men running around feverishly trying to execute this woman's whims. It makes nonsense of the whole situation. Ewan McGregor is sweet and charismatic (and lovely to look at) as the much screamed about Jeromeone wonders what did he ever see in the aggravating Nagiko.

    I voted 3 for this movie because it looks great as does all of Greenaways output. However it was his usual mix of "art" sex and pretentious crap.I know lots of people like this film but I grew tired of it VERY quickly. It is definitely not for everyone. The ubiquitous McGregor obviously took the part for crediblity's sake I guess but he really should not have wasted his time. I hate to consign anyone to pseud's corner but please.....!!! On the plus side it IS visually very attractive and I enjoyed the music but could not see it through to the end and I cannot say that for many movies. I usually watch the whole thing but this is unbearable!!

    The pillow book is 1,000 year old Asian journal of ancient philosophical writings. A six year old girl is read to by her mother from the pillow book and is told by her father to begin a diary of her own. Nagiko(Vivian Wu) is constantly having calligraphy done in ink, first on her face, then on her body. She is obsessed with having artists write on her skin and she draws her feelings on others. Peter Greenaway's use of picture in picture images is a distracting device and the plot is fairly simplistic with Nagiko's search for partners willing to use her body as a canvas, even to the point of having the "Our Father" drawn onto her arm, chest and stomach; this is a very off-beat tale which features frequent nudity, both male and female. Greenaway's eye for images is sharp but the film is repetitive and needed to be shortened by at least 15 or 20 minutes. Vivian Wu is beautiful as Nagiko, the lead character and Ewan McGregor is always good.

    The thing about cinema in general, a Western invention and as such shaped by Western thinking, is that it is often too specific, about physical action revealing a moral understanding. The insight is shortsighted. To abstract as all the great filmmakers known to us have done, is to transplant that specific experience into the center from where all creative energy emanates. The Japanese (tracing it back to China) had mastered this centuries ago. It's a culture that revolves around form rather than narrative. Whereas our drama is often hysterical, theirs is subdued and sublimated into abstraction. Their abstraction is in the best possible way about a perfect centeredness. Flowing from and returning to a center. Flowing outwards into form and once replenished there, returning with wisdom about the emptiness of form (and joy that the form is only a mask). Their compositions (painted, written, or later filmed) are clean and sparse, signifying the vitally empty as a dynamic process. Thus every utterance in form, say by the calligrapher's brush, perfectly radiates with that transcendence of opposites - the vital and the empty are one. There is no confusion or agitation that comes from attachment, that's the idea at least. The thing about Greenaway is that he's aiming for a similar transcendence, but through an effort of loading forms until they break to reveal. When he fills his films with lists and lists about books, our constricted knowledge of the world and how it limits, it is always with the intent of transcending them. It is always about the creative process as a means of reaching beyond the list. Prospero's Books reaches there, arguably however the work was already laid out for him by Shakespeare. Here he tackles a subject that is completely alien to Greenaway logic. It is about a young Japanese woman doggedly looking to find a man who is both a lover and a calligrapher. Who can write beautifully on her naked body. The film specific idea chimes with the heart of the abstraction; inner expression expressed in visible form, with in our case the naked body as a perfect blank paper. And that expression in form brought by its author literally to life. There is not much to say on the subject outside the depiction. The very act communicates all. So that leaves the rest of the film a series of beautiful tableaux about bodies, naked or not, painted or not, and calligraphic backdrops of various kinds. Eventually it is again about books, human books each with its own message, where thought is exorcised so that it can be replenished again. Having emptied herself of all the accumulations of her past, by the end she is free to write her own 'pillow book'. She can sign her own name. As usually with Greenaway, everything is also about him creating his own film. Maybe because he's done this kind of thing for so long that it has lost its novelty, maybe because his style to overload is in stark contrast with the vital emptiness the subject demands, the film seems to be missing something. Prospero's Books was closer to his sensibility and as such a more rewarding film (if also more oblique and difficult).

    Miller Analogy Test: Occasionally cold is to Antarctica as Occasionally obsessional is to Peter Greenaway. This film goes way beyond being a study in art form and the blending of body and calligraphy -- the detour into Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder-land morphs into a permanent trip to the insane asylum. Let's consider the repetitive elements: Body calligraphy starting from the first scene that reoccurs year by year, and later in more modern life, day-by-day; the picture-in-picture techniques; the subtitled translations; the various books that appear in many guises. This is fractal film making where the larger image is actually repeated copies in ever smaller form without boundaries, without any consideration outside of art, form, and the pure expression of sensuality (in all senses, but particularly vision and touch). // I suspect I'm one of the few people giving this movie a mid-rating. Except to observe a tour-de-force of a singular obsession, I can't imagine why one would voluntarily see the whole movie.

    Ewan McGregor, playing an English translator in Hong Kong, has a love affair with a Japanese woman with a very curious fetish: writing in fine Japanese calligraphy the body of her lovers. Sex and literature can be a good combination, but not if the chef is Peter Greenaway (The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover). The movie is very silly, but is sort of watchable (the obvious beauty of Vivian Wu, who plays the Japanese lover and appears naked several times - as does McGregor - certainly helps). This was the last film of Greenaway to have some sort of commercial impact. After that, he made the awful 8 1/2 Women and then retreated to the art world (where he probably feels more comfortable).

    This film is about a Japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on skin. The plot is absolutely bizarre. I fail to see any "sensual" or "erotic" undertones. The plot turns an ancient art form into a fetishistic pornography. In addition, the scenes that are filmed in Hong Kong are certainly portraying bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the airport in the middle of the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the whole film, I keep thinking that "The Pillow Book" is insulting the Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment. "The Pillow Book" is a perverted, yet boring film. Seriously stay away from it.

    After the completion of Prospero's Books in 1991, Greenaway was quoted in an article on IMDb as saying: "I'm pretty certain Michael and I will never ever work together again." After making a few films with various composers after his breakup with Nyman, Greenaway made a major attempt at creating a sound track from existing music, and the outstanding results are the music of The Pillow Book. Chosen with great care, the music is a document to his outstanding sense of taste, and reflects a very high level of musical awareness. In each scene, the music supports the drama to the fullest: observe the corny pop song that recalls Nagiko's parents early years; or the silly socialist workers song, lacking in all things sophisticated; or the extremely beautiful French love song that is heard when the lovers are together; or the violent avant-garde string quartet music used first for the fire scene, and later when Jerome commits suicide. Greenway's choice of soundtrack here is every bit as outstanding as that of Stanly Kubrick, which reflects the finest taste of any 20th-century director. (Greenway's choice of music here is as keen as Kubrick's choice of music in Eyes Wide Shut, etc.). As such, The Pillow Book does not have the tight neo-classic aura that we find in Greenaways films with music by Nyman. It is actually quite different, and we miss the unique relationship the two presented in so many masterworks. Never-the-less, what Greenaway has come up with here is excellent in its own way, and although it has taken the director in a new direction, it is still of a very high quality.

The plot turns an ancient art form into a fetishistic pornography. In addition, the scenes that are filmed in Hong Kong are certainly portraying bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the airport in the middle of the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the whole film, I keep thinking that "The Pillow Book" is insulting the Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment. "The Pillow Book" is a perverted, yet boring film. Seriously stay away from it.

    After the completion of Prospero's Books in 1991, Greenaway was quoted in an article on IMDb as saying: "I'm pretty certain Michael and I will never ever work together again." After making a few films with various composers after his breakup with Nyman, Greenaway made a major attempt at creating a sound track from existing music, and the outstanding results are the music of The Pillow Book. Chosen with great care, the music is a document to his outstanding sense of taste, and reflects a very high level of musical awareness. In each scene, the music supports the drama to the fullest: observe the corny pop song that recalls Nagiko's parents early years; or the silly socialist workers song, lacking in all things sophisticated; or the extremely beautiful French love song that is heard when the lovers are together; or the violent avant-garde string quartet music used first for the fire scene, and later when Jerome commits suicide. Greenway's choice of soundtrack here is every bit as outstanding as that of Stanly Kubrick, which reflects the finest taste of any 20th-century director. (Greenway's choice of music here is as keen as Kubrick's choice of music in Eyes Wide Shut, etc.). As such, The Pillow Book does not have the tight neo-classic aura that we find in Greenaways films with music by Nyman. It is actually quite different, and we miss the unique relationship the two presented in so many masterworks. Never-the-less, what Greenaway has come up with here is excellent in its own way, and although it has taken the director in a new direction, it is still of a very high quality.

    I really wanted to like The Pillow Book. Intriguing story, interesting character outlines, Ewan Macgregor in the utterly glorious altogether. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of it. Greenaway got so enamoured with presenting the movie uniquely, and not to the film's benefit. I won't even get into Vivian Wu's abysmal acting. You get distracted from the story with 4 billion teeny windows and calligraphy that rolls on the bottom of the screen displaying the lyrics of the music that's playing. It seems he lost sight of presenting the actual story and developing the plot, and got entangled with foo-foo embellishments that have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like presenting a John Singer Sargeant portrait in a chintzy Hallmark frame that says "GRANDMA LOVES ME!" in big sparkly letters. This movie seems to be a casualty of the director auteur's ego instead of what it could have been - disturbingly and horrifyingly beautiful. In another director's hands (Jeunet? Coppola?), it could have been a masterpiece. In Greenaway's hands, it's best relegated to fine arts classes that also take themselves too seriously.

    I'm not even completely sure how I came across this film - it was either on the internet somewhere, or by sheer coincidence. But I definitely do not regret putting my two hours into it. I gave The Pillow Book a 9 out 10, simply because the director tried a little too hard with the picture-in-picture thing. Sometimes simultaneously watching two different, sometimes three different scenes at once, got a little chaotic and tiring. But more than that, it eventually just became annoying, and slightly irritated me a bit by the end. It definitely wasn't enough to take away from the film itself, though, it especially did not alter the plot in any way, shape, or form. A minor annoyance, that was meant to be artistic, but was eventually a little over-done in my own, personal opinion, while watching the film. I won't go into much detail of the plot, as countless other comments have already done so, but I will say this: I was a little lost at certain parts of this movie, and I'm not usually one to say that often. One of the parts was a very important scene in the film, that has a whole lot to do with everything, in the end. The scene I'm talking about is when the main character's father is being forced to have homosexual relations with his publisher in order to get his things published. When this was shown, it was just a little peek into the room, and I, for whatever reason, did not pick up on what was going on. Soon enough, the scene ended, another began, and I continued on my merry little way throughout the film, completely oblivious to the importance of that scene. There were a couple other, maybe 1 or 2, parts where I stopped and thought, "Wait, what?", but continued on, but they were so few, and much less important than that first one. So, do not be afraid of stopping the movie for a second, or rewinding it, if you are a little confused. At some points you're supposed to be confused, but others, you're not. I will admit that while my first run through this film, had I not finished it yet and was only a little bit before halfway through it, I would have probably given it a 6/10, maybe 7/10. It, at times, although I hate to admit it now, became a little boring to me. Some parts just did not make sense, and the little picture-in-picture was beginning to get to me some. But, I urge you all to stick with it, as it DOES get better! And it is completely worth your time in the end. There's no way I would regret spending two hours of my time for this film now, and I would love to see it again, though in a reasonable space of time. It's not exactly a movie you'd see once, and then go see again one or two days later since you loved it. It's more like you loved it still, but you should watch it with big time intervals inbetween. You'll forget the little details, and then, once immersed to it again, it will seem all the more pleasantly erotic and interesting. The tale even has a darker side to things towards the end, which was a bit of a surprise for me. Bottom line, I recommend this film to anyone who is open minded, mature, and has an interest in seeing and learning about new cultural experiences.

    Inventive and most original, full of arresting images and unpredictable developments, this flick has one fatal flaw. The whole progression of the story is predicated on the character Nagiko's obsessive power over others. One would have to have the beauty and fascination of ten Mata Haris to carry off this woman's singular willfulness. But the actress who impersonates Nagiko has none of that. She is a reasonably pretty female with little or no personal magnetism that one can discern. Her high-pitched voice and peevish, juvenile enunciation of the English language are singularly irritating. At one point she is called by the script to scream out the name Jerome a dozen times (she pronounces it "J'roam"): she sounds like a hysterical high school student, or perhaps a dental assistant whose finger has been drilled through. As a result of this flaw, the spectator is bewildered by the sight of two dozen men running around feverishly trying to execute this woman's whims. It makes nonsense of the whole situation. Ewan McGregor is sweet and charismatic (and lovely to look at) as the much screamed about Jeromeone wonders what did he ever see in the aggravating Nagiko.

However it was his usual mix of "art" sex and pretentious crap.I know lots of people like this film but I grew tired of it VERY quickly. It is definitely not for everyone. The ubiquitous McGregor obviously took the part for crediblity's sake I guess but he really should not have wasted his time. I hate to consign anyone to pseud's corner but please.....!!! On the plus side it IS visually very attractive and I enjoyed the music but could not see it through to the end and I cannot say that for many movies. I usually watch the whole thing but this is unbearable!!

    The pillow book is 1,000 year old Asian journal of ancient philosophical writings. A six year old girl is read to by her mother from the pillow book and is told by her father to begin a diary of her own. Nagiko(Vivian Wu) is constantly having calligraphy done in ink, first on her face, then on her body. She is obsessed with having artists write on her skin and she draws her feelings on others. Peter Greenaway's use of picture in picture images is a distracting device and the plot is fairly simplistic with Nagiko's search for partners willing to use her body as a canvas, even to the point of having the "Our Father" drawn onto her arm, chest and stomach; this is a very off-beat tale which features frequent nudity, both male and female. Greenaway's eye for images is sharp but the film is repetitive and needed to be shortened by at least 15 or 20 minutes. Vivian Wu is beautiful as Nagiko, the lead character and Ewan McGregor is always good.

    The thing about cinema in general, a Western invention and as such shaped by Western thinking, is that it is often too specific, about physical action revealing a moral understanding. The insight is shortsighted. To abstract as all the great filmmakers known to us have done, is to transplant that specific experience into the center from where all creative energy emanates. The Japanese (tracing it back to China) had mastered this centuries ago. It's a culture that revolves around form rather than narrative. Whereas our drama is often hysterical, theirs is subdued and sublimated into abstraction. Their abstraction is in the best possible way about a perfect centeredness. Flowing from and returning to a center. Flowing outwards into form and once replenished there, returning with wisdom about the emptiness of form (and joy that the form is only a mask). Their compositions (painted, written, or later filmed) are clean and sparse, signifying the vitally empty as a dynamic process. Thus every utterance in form, say by the calligrapher's brush, perfectly radiates with that transcendence of opposites - the vital and the empty are one. There is no confusion or agitation that comes from attachment, that's the idea at least. The thing about Greenaway is that he's aiming for a similar transcendence, but through an effort of loading forms until they break to reveal. When he fills his films with lists and lists about books, our constricted knowledge of the world and how it limits, it is always with the intent of transcending them. It is always about the creative process as a means of reaching beyond the list. Prospero's Books reaches there, arguably however the work was already laid out for him by Shakespeare. Here he tackles a subject that is completely alien to Greenaway logic. It is about a young Japanese woman doggedly looking to find a man who is both a lover and a calligrapher. Who can write beautifully on her naked body. The film specific idea chimes with the heart of the abstraction; inner expression expressed in visible form, with in our case the naked body as a perfect blank paper. And that expression in form brought by its author literally to life. There is not much to say on the subject outside the depiction. The very act communicates all. So that leaves the rest of the film a series of beautiful tableaux about bodies, naked or not, painted or not, and calligraphic backdrops of various kinds. Eventually it is again about books, human books each with its own message, where thought is exorcised so that it can be replenished again. Having emptied herself of all the accumulations of her past, by the end she is free to write her own 'pillow book'. She can sign her own name. As usually with Greenaway, everything is also about him creating his own film. Maybe because he's done this kind of thing for so long that it has lost its novelty, maybe because his style to overload is in stark contrast with the vital emptiness the subject demands, the film seems to be missing something. Prospero's Books was closer to his sensibility and as such a more rewarding film (if also more oblique and difficult).

    Miller Analogy Test: Occasionally cold is to Antarctica as Occasionally obsessional is to Peter Greenaway. This film goes way beyond being a study in art form and the blending of body and calligraphy -- the detour into Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder-land morphs into a permanent trip to the insane asylum. Let's consider the repetitive elements: Body calligraphy starting from the first scene that reoccurs year by year, and later in more modern life, day-by-day; the picture-in-picture techniques; the subtitled translations; the various books that appear in many guises. This is fractal film making where the larger image is actually repeated copies in ever smaller form without boundaries, without any consideration outside of art, form, and the pure expression of sensuality (in all senses, but particularly vision and touch). // I suspect I'm one of the few people giving this movie a mid-rating. Except to observe a tour-de-force of a singular obsession, I can't imagine why one would voluntarily see the whole movie.

    Ewan McGregor, playing an English translator in Hong Kong, has a love affair with a Japanese woman with a very curious fetish: writing in fine Japanese calligraphy the body of her lovers. Sex and literature can be a good combination, but not if the chef is Peter Greenaway (The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover). The movie is very silly, but is sort of watchable (the obvious beauty of Vivian Wu, who plays the Japanese lover and appears naked several times - as does McGregor - certainly helps). This was the last film of Greenaway to have some sort of commercial impact. After that, he made the awful 8 1/2 Women and then retreated to the art world (where he probably feels more comfortable).
