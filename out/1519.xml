    Great movie, one of the best i ever seen period...It's raw, gritty, and takes you inside the movie and makes you feel that you're actually there. It's true to life feel is what i think really made the movie. Going to high school during the late nineties era i could definitely relate to a lot that was going on in these young boys life. I too had friends like these but never took the route that they did. The movie is so perfect and so on point it's like everything was meant to be the way that it went. Each character was believable, the music went with the setting, the fashion fits the era and the slang and everything else feel in line with the movie as well. I guess because of the somewhat similar experience i had in high school with my friends really plays a role on why i love the movie so much; when you relate to something it grabs your attention a little more. But overall this is easily one of the most slept on movies of all time, not just hood movie but movie period. It never got bored and kept you wanting more (ooh and the soundtrack is on point as well). If you haven't check this movie out do so, if anyone wants to know what it was like to be young, black, lost and living in the mid to late nineties check this movie out as it perfectly depicts it. I would love to see a reunion of the characters in the movie to see where they're at now with their lives. Lastly r.i.p. Heavy D. he almost single handedly stole the movie with his one line.

    This movie is good on so many levels. It's about The lives of a group of Newark New Jersey urban youth. Newark New Jersey is the car theft capital of the world. (at least the US) Fun fact. Newark alone has more car thefts than LA and NYC put together. That's where the "Drive" in the title comes from. Anyways, it's a lot like other movies of this period. Ala "Juice" ..Boys in the Hood". The main difference with this film though is the social message and Density of the characters. Jason..played by Sharron Corley is very good in this. I must say though that Gabriel Casseus who plays "midget" Takes this movie to another level. He's so good in this. It's no mystery he's a good actor but in this he's amazing. I don't wanna give away too much of the story but basically Jason and Midget get caught up with the world of Car Theft and corrupt cops etc...Although they are criminals, u feel compassion for WHY they do what they do. The cop they call Roscoe is a menace. U actually FEEL for Jason and Midget. It by non means glorifies street life at all. There's one scene that kinda sums up the attitude of a lot of Urban Youth of that time. ( Myself included) Its the scene where Midget gets chased by the cops and they make him empty is beer out. He later returns to the same beer after the beat down by the dopes to finish it lol I think Next to Clockers and Fresh this is my fav " Hood" movie. ( Menace to Society and American Me are close behind this)

    This movie is a good over cap of what happened in Newark. I'm young so around the time that this may have happened I was a baby. This movie gives of a realistic Vibe like your watching a documentary of the main characters life. What people don't know is some of the things in the movie is true other then Newark being the highest place of car theft. In the end when the news dispatch about the van with midget in being shot n two people being killed was true. Well the pregnant teen being shot and killed what's crazy is things like showing true action makes this movie one that keeps your eyes glued on the screen and not want to miss any part. This movie is great and is a must see.

    ***SPOILER*** Life on the mean streets of Newark New Jersey is brutally depicted in "New Jersey Drive" that at the time, and even now, was among other things what Newark's Mayor Sharpe James wanted to keep out of the film in it being the car theft capital of the world. In fact Mayor James refused to have any footage of the movie shot within Newark city limits taking away a good part of the movies authenticity! The movie starts with a carjacking gone bad that ends up putting one of the carjackers Ronnie Lambs, Koran C. Thomas,in the hospital on life support. Lambs and his fellow carjackers unknowingly carjacked tough take no BS Newark cop Emil Rosco's, Saul Stein, car. It was Officer Rosco who just happened to be on the scene when Ronnie and his friends were ambushed in a police string. Shot four times by Rosco Ronnie now in the hospital and no gun found on him has Rosco in deep trouble with the only witness to the shooting fellow carjacker Jason Petty, Shannon Corley, slated to testify against him before the grand jury! This all sets the stage for Rosco hounding Jason all throughout the movie to get him to change his testimony. As for Jason he gives Rosco and the Newark Police all the rope they need to hang him by continuously going out with his friends carjacking cars thus putting his and their lives as well as freedom in jeopardy. Jason's mom Rene Petty, Gwen McGee, knows that her son is out stealing cars instead of going to school but try as she does Rene can't convince him that he'll end up either dead or behind bars as a result of his actions. It's later when his straight as an arrow sister Jackie, Samantha Brown, starts to hang out with the same crowd that Jason does that he throws a fit that almost has him gunned down by her new found "Gangsta" boyfriend Ritchie, Andre Moore. Ritchie feels that Jason "dists" him by trying to keep Jackie from ending up like him: Out of luck out of work out of school and nothing in life to look forward too! Stealing cars together with his friend Midget, Gabe Casseus, Jason tries to make a few bucks for his troubles by selling them to this chop-chop junk yard operator, Arthur J. Nascarella, in what looks like the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn for pennies on the dollar. Despite all the business they give him the junk yard man almost throws Midget out of his place when he comes unannounced with his latest steal not wanting the cops to connect him, by buying stolen merchandise, to Midgets & Jason's criminal activities! it's later when the law finally catches up with Jason that ends with one of his many carjacking friends being gunned down that he finally realizes that this life is not for him. ****SPOILERS**** Spending 90 days behind bars in a juvenile dentition center Jason finally saw the light and decided to go back to school and put his life of crime behind him. The fact that Officer Rosco was indited in the Ronnie Lambs shooting helps also in Jason now not having to worry about Rosco framing or working him over, which he did a number of time in the movie, to keep him from talking. It was in fact Midget's fiery death is a stolen car chased by police that finally convinced Jason that he was right in his decision to go straight! It was Jasons refusal to join Midget and his friends in this latest carjacking caper that ended up saving his life!

    I lived in that area (Hoboken and Jersey City)for about ten years. This film certainly captures the feel of that time and place. The dialogue is very good, the music is right and scenarios realistic. As another poster said, it looks almost like a documentary. I like the way it humanizes these kids, who probably would have rather have been born in Westchester, but fall into what kids fall into. It just so happens that area is pretty rough. They over-demonize the cops quite a bit, but that's to be expected. I'd say the acting is good all-around, too. It gives the viewer some sense of how this idiocy is caused and gets blown out-of-proportion. Hopefully, the new mayor of Newark is making progress.

    I thought Nick Gomez's look at the gritty streets of New Jersey, where car-jackings are at an all-time high, was both thought-provoking and entertaining. This is just as good as movies like Boyz n the Hood or Menace II Society or Above the Rim. I thought the actors and the scenarios were suitable, it had a gritty realistic feel to it and was very atmospheric, whether on purpose or by raw coincidence. I liked this movie a lot, an underrated gem i found on TV and glad i caught it. Go watch this movie if you get a shot. If they don't have a DVD, they should release one. Well done Nick Gomez. IMDb Rating: 5.9. My Rating: 9/10

    WOW I Love this movie. This is definitely added to my list of Ghetto Movies. Juice - Starring Tupac 'I don't giva F***' Menace II Society - O-Dawg 'I'll smoke Anybody, I just don't giva F****' New Jersey Drive - Hey they steal cars in broad daylight they obviously don't giva f*** New Jersey Drive is the best hood movie ever. It is at the top of the list, menace II society is second, and juice is third, Clockers is really stupid. The soundtrack for New Jersey Drive is Pwnage too Mac Mall & Young Lay - All about my fetti is heard through out the movie. Lords of the underground - Burn rubber, another good song, and so is Ill & Al Scratch - don't shut down on a player If your a fan of GTA-SA you'll freaking love this movie, AND The amazing soundtrack. The soundtrack is basically Rap about stealing cars ^_^ SWEETTTT Movie!

    This movie brings to mind "Boys 'n the Hood," "Menace to Society," "South Central" and others of its ilk and even shares actors with some of them. The film's "us vs. the law" mentality is underscored by the all-black neighborhood vs. the nearly all-white police force. Here the cops are so bad they seem like caricatures and in one scene they even ambush the boys as they drive by in a car they've just "liberated" from its owner. It's like a bushwhacking from an old Western, but the contemporary setting makes it look all too real. The story centers on young Jason Petty and his buddies, to whom school is just an inconvenience that takes time away from their "real occupation" of boosting cars. This happens to be Newark, N.J., a rust-belt city low on jobs but notoriously high on crime. In fact the problem is so severe that the cops all have "Car Theft" written on their backs, to show that an entire unit must be devoted to this particular crime. The boys use a "slim Jim" to gleefully break into cars and go joy-riding, as if it's no big deal. They only run into real trouble when the police ambush them. The vicious, Nazi-like Lt. has a vendetta against the boys, seeing them not as human beings who might be worthy of redemption, but as human targets. In fact, he's a little reminiscent of that sadistic Nazi officer of the Warsaw ghetto, who shot down Jews for pleasure in the film "Schindler's List." When the boys steal a police car in retribution for the ambush, things predictably go downhill fast. They are severely beaten by the cops and Jason finally ends up in prison. Clearly these are "bad boys," who'd steal your car in a minute, but the film wants us to see them as anti-heroes, showing Jason protecting his sister and his friend taking care of his own grandmother. The film left us wondering whose side to take and who to feel sadder for: the boys whose lives are going down the drain, the honest citizens whose cars are being stolen left and right and who could be caught in the crossfire of a shootout at any moment or the city of Newark itself, the spirit of whose law is being betrayed by brutal, soul-dead cops. In spite of the over-the-top portrayal of the latter, the film offers a realistic-looking rendering of the ghetto, of the protagonists and their families and of the culture of car theft in a city where there appears to be only 2 career paths - law enforcement and crime. Strangely, the entire subject of drugs is never mentioned. The filmmakers (including producer Spike Lee) are obviously biased against the Newark police, who, we hope, are not as bad they are portrayed here. Nevertheless, they've given us yet another a strong, affecting story about the inner city and black youth gone awry and Sharron Corley is fine as Jason.

    This film is explosive!Probably the most entertaining `Growing up in the hood movie` ever.Its made very realistic and has a brutal story of survival and police brutality against juvenile offenders.You never get board because there's something going on every time,from start to finish,and the sound track makes it even better.Its like a documentary of juvenile delinquency,mostly car thefts,and life in the toughest black suburbs in New Jersey. Based on reality,true in every way!

    New Jersey Drive is a very underrated movie to put it quite bluntly. As it's supposed to in urban movies, the street atmosphere was definitely there. The script was good because it showed a crrosroad as Jason's crew and the cops lives crossed paths, I don't wanna give this away though. Sharron Corley gives a good performance as the humble but tough Jason, as does Gabriel Casseus as the knucklehead Midget and Don Faison as Tiny Dime, etc., etc. It was also wonderfully directed by Nick Gomez and also stars Heavy D and Michele Morgan. authentic street movie 10/10

The film left us wondering whose side to take and who to feel sadder for: the boys whose lives are going down the drain, the honest citizens whose cars are being stolen left and right and who could be caught in the crossfire of a shootout at any moment or the city of Newark itself, the spirit of whose law is being betrayed by brutal, soul-dead cops. In spite of the over-the-top portrayal of the latter, the film offers a realistic-looking rendering of the ghetto, of the protagonists and their families and of the culture of car theft in a city where there appears to be only 2 career paths - law enforcement and crime. Strangely, the entire subject of drugs is never mentioned. The filmmakers (including producer Spike Lee) are obviously biased against the Newark police, who, we hope, are not as bad they are portrayed here. Nevertheless, they've given us yet another a strong, affecting story about the inner city and black youth gone awry and Sharron Corley is fine as Jason.

    This film is explosive!Probably the most entertaining `Growing up in the hood movie` ever.Its made very realistic and has a brutal story of survival and police brutality against juvenile offenders.You never get board because there's something going on every time,from start to finish,and the sound track makes it even better.Its like a documentary of juvenile delinquency,mostly car thefts,and life in the toughest black suburbs in New Jersey. Based on reality,true in every way!

    New Jersey Drive is a very underrated movie to put it quite bluntly. As it's supposed to in urban movies, the street atmosphere was definitely there. The script was good because it showed a crrosroad as Jason's crew and the cops lives crossed paths, I don't wanna give this away though. Sharron Corley gives a good performance as the humble but tough Jason, as does Gabriel Casseus as the knucklehead Midget and Don Faison as Tiny Dime, etc., etc. It was also wonderfully directed by Nick Gomez and also stars Heavy D and Michele Morgan. authentic street movie 10/10
