 </sinopse>
 <storyline>

    Without doubt the dirtiest war of the late 20th Century was the war in Chechnya . It was actually two wars from 1994to 1996 and flared up in to a second war that lasted from 1999 to 2007 and even today there's acts of sporadic violence . The wars have cost the Russians as much as 8,000 military while the Chechens themselves may have lost 250,000 people both combatants and civilian , a quarter of the population of Chechnya . The worst thing is neither can claim any moral high ground . The Chechens may claim to be victims of genocide but any resistance that involves massacring civilians at Russian schools , cinemas and hospitals has a hard time of claiming victim hood The most compelling account of the conflict comes from the pen of Arkady Babchenko in his book One Soldier's War In Chechnya . It tells of his time as a conscript in the Russian army in the first war and of his time as a regular volunteer in the second war . What quickly becomes apparent is what a brutal institution the Russian army is . Recruits spend the first year of their service under " the rule of the grandfathers " soldiers in their second year where recruits are subject to effective slavery at its most brutal and unrelenting which will shock anyone who has any military understanding PRISONER OF THE MOUNTAINS is set during the first Chechen war where two Russian soldiers , Sgt Kostylin and Private Zhilin , are captured by rebels . The film does allude to the structural gulf between an experienced soldier like Kostylin and a recruit like Zhilin , the older soldier doesn't believe the Chechens will trade the recruit because he's unimportant to the Russian army but this is quickly forgotten about as the film moves in to predictable and simplistic territory that states that no matter the conflict and the uniforms we wear we are all human beings caught up in situations made by others It's a well enough made film but by the same token there's nothing outstanding about it either . There's also the problem that if you've read Babchenko's book featuring the very real atrocities each side has committed against the other - in fact each side also commits atrocities on their own - then it does have a rather Walt Disney feel

    The film is simple, powerful and convincing. Two Russian soldiers (Oleg Menshikov and Sergei Bodrov Jr.) are captured by a Chechen father (Dzhemal Sikharulidze) determined to exchange them for his son, but the prisoners escape. Prisoner Of The Mountains is an off-centre war story that concentrates less on the horror of conflict than the humanity, even across cultural and national divides, and successfully sustains interest. The film was awarded a Crystal Globe at the 1996 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, and the same year was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

    Based on a short story by the great writer Leo Tolstoy, Prisoner of the Mountains is a wonderful, bittersweet anti-war story directed by Sergei Bodrov. Two Russians soldiers - Sacha (Oleg Menshikov) and Vanya (Sergei Bodrov Jr.) are capture by Muslim rebels and brought to a remote village in the mountains, where Abdul-Murat (Jemal Sikharulidze) keeps them as hostages to exchange with his son, prisoner of the Russians. The relationship between the characters is the core of the movie. First, the camaraderie between the two prisoners. Sacha is older, bitter, cocky, whereas Vanya is young and naive. The two seem to have nothing in common apart for their situation, but they slowly bond; it might sound conventional but their growing friendship is written and acted so well that it doesn't come as clich&eacute;d at all. Even more interesting is the relationships between the two prisoners and their captors - Abdul-Murat, his young daughter Dina (the excellent Susanna Mekhralyeva) and their "guard", mute Hasan (Aleksandr Bureyev). A typical Hollywood movie would probably have made their interaction very sappy, but here the feeling of friendship between prisoners and captors - as they start to know each other - are portrayed in an understated, sober manner, and therefore are moving and touching; it never looks phony or sappy. The acting could not be better. Menshikov is perfect as the ironic Sacha; the actor makes him increasingly likable (as he bonds with Vanya and with the rebels) but never loses the character's edge. Likewise, Bodrov Jr. gives a vivid, sincere portrayal of the young, quiet Vanya. Sikharulidze plays Abdul-Murat as a cold and detached but decent and fair man who occasionally shows glimpses of kindness. And Mekhralyeva is magnificent as the young Dina - honestly one of the best performances from a child actress I have ever seen. Without spoiling anything, I'll say that the bittersweet ending is powerful, effective and memorable. A must-see 10/10

    As other have commented, the movie tries to apply a relatively even hand to both sides of the chechen conflict, possibly being a little more biased to the chechen point of view. What surprised me about this movie was that I came out of it more supportive of the Russian side of the conflict. Let me explain: Lets say you are a American living in present day Wyoming. Now imagine if there still existed unassimilated cheyenne indians in the area living out their old traditions and who would still periodically conduct war parties and scalp and kill anyone they found who was not a part of their tribe. If you are living in Wyoming, taking trips outside urbanized areas becomes quite harrowing. Such conditions would make one lose one's fascination of Indian culture quite rapidly. Present day conditions in the Caucauses are not so much different than the hypothetical example given above. These traditional Islamic cultures can be extraordinarily savage and haven't progressed much in the last 1000 years. The only current technology they have embraced is that which allows them to kill more people. The movie is well written and directed. It does try to be as honest as humanly possible with the subject matter. As a result, one is not preached to and allowed to make up their own mind, which is very rare in film.

    I rented this film expecting something a bit different - maybe something in the style of "Kukushka" - a story with a deep understanding of human nature, but with a feel good ending. I got an even better film. This film sneaked into my heart slowly and quietly. Like Vanya, I grew to understand and love its characters, regardless of "sides". As the plot developed, I understood how easy it was for one side to mistake the other one's intentions; how tradition, so important for people's cultural survival, ended up working against them, fueling the fire that perpetuated the hate; how one side's disregard about the other one's culture/mentality, and the stereotypical way of looking at the enemy added to the mistrust and hatred between both sides. The story is told with cinematic brilliance: simply, almost austerely, with tiny details that make the viewer grow an affectionate, understanding eye for the characters: little Dina, with her lonely, pure heart, adorning herself for Vanya and telling him about her grandmother's necklace, or explaining with the wisdom of a grown-up why she and he could never marry; the children and the Muslim soldiers dancing and playing according to their customs; tongueless Hassan; Vanya's mother hitting the Russian commander when she realizes his methods would get her son killed instead of rescued, dare-devil Sacha with his phlegmatic, humorous yet realistic view on life and war; the Russian Commander's appreciation for good quality food and vodka, etc. Then, there are the human interactions between the two sides: the Russian soldiers trading weapons for vodka with the enemy; the Muslim soldiers showing respect for the two Russian prisoners who managed to clear a road of mines and stay alive; Hassan procuring alcohol for the two prisoners and letting them dance and enjoy themselves, the Muslim villager asking Vanya to fix his clock... The cinematography is excellent; the beauty of the film comes not from any artificially enhanced imaging of the beautiful, harsh landscape, but from authenticity and masterful lens work. This film is unadulterated by big budget glitzy details; one almost feels is watching a documentary of the life in that part of the world, which makes the plot of the film hit like real events would and affect us almost as if we were on that mountain too. Many people are killed in this film, yet one feels there are no good or bad characters, only human beings locked in a conflict that perpetuates itself, because each side's quest for justice is confused with exacting retribution or revenge. Vanya and, eventually, Abdul see that, but like everyone else, they're prisoners of their own circumstances. The film's ending tore at my heart. As the helicopters were flying towards the village, I realized that was the only logical, true to life ending. A happy end that would please the viewer, where things were clarified and Abdul's final act of humanity and compassion was not fruitless, was not possible without turning the film into a fairy tale for adults. A complex, poignant story told in a masterful way.

    One might assume that the title refers only to the two Russian soldiers taken hostage by villagers in the Caucasus. But the Russian army has the village surrounded, so the townspeople are also prisoners. Moreover, each side is a prisoner of their own hate: the Russians can't see the villagers as humans and the villagers can't see the Russians as humans, thereby continuing the cycle of hate. Even the village elder is a prisoner of tradition: he uses a ceremonial knife for something in which he could have used a gun. All in all, "Kavkazskiy plennik" (called "Prisoner of the Mountains" in English) is a very well done movie. Oleg Menshikov and Sergei Bodrov Jr. do very well with their roles, and the situation in Chechnya makes the movie all the more relevant.

    Sergei Bodrov shows here that he is one of the most talented filmmakers in Russia today, with this riveting tale from the Chechen war. "Kavkazskij plennik" stars his own son Sergei jr. and Oleg Menshikov and both do a fabulous job as the Russian soldiers imprisoned by the Chechens in Caucasus. This movie is just what the world needed at such a time-an open hearted and humanistic telling about the evils of war and the uselesness of it all. Although the Russians can sometimes seem portrayed as the better side here and Chechens as ruthless, primitive, barbaric religious fanatics, the portrayal of the Russian commander quickly erases that impression. Here we see the laid back and careless attitude that mirrors the real Russian generals' attitude. The film is pretty tragic, from the death of Menshikov's character and to the tragic and unfortunate killing of Abdul-Murat's son, yet it leaves some hope in the end as Abdul-Murat shows pity for the young soldier whose mother has appealed for his release directly to him. But just as you think that this film will end well, the airplanes come. The ending is truly remarkable and well shot. It echoes the message of the absurdity of war and leaves us with little hope for the peace in the Caucasus.10 out of 10.

    In the war between Russia and Chechnya, the two Russian soldiers Sacha (Oleg Menshikov) and Vanya (Sergei Bodrov Jr.) are ambushed and made prisoners of war by a group of Chechens. The old man Abdul-Murat (Dzhemal Sikharulidze) wants to exchange them by his last son, who was arrested by the Russian troops. His other two sons were killed by the Russians, and his family is composed only by his teenager daughter Dina (Susanna Mekhraliyeva) and himself. The two soldiers are kept alive in his village, while Abdul tries to negotiate them with the Russian Commander Maslov (Aleksei Zharkov). Sacha and Vanya are very different persons and while together, they get closer. Sacha has the mentality of a soldier, intending to kill the Chechens from the village, while Vanya is a teacher and prefers to try to understand the locals behavior and culture, performing small jobs for them, like fixing clocks. Vanya falls in love with Dina. This beautiful movie is another magnificent anti-war movie. The touching story, supported by an excellent cast and the Caucasian locations, makes this movie a worthwhile entertainment. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): `Prisioneiros das Montanhas' (`Prisoners of the Mountains')

    Contains SPOILERS In this film, Bodrov goes beyond the anti-war dialog by portraying those who fight the war (at least on the Russian side) as the root cause of the problem. Although it contains many of the same elements as anti-war films produced in the United States, the dichotomy between the two prisoners, Sasha and Vanya, is unique. Introduced to the viewer in a scene in which their unit comes under fire, their reactions to the ambush establish their character differences. Sacha stands in the open, shooting from the hip at anything that moves with a crazed look on his face (anyone who has seen Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" will be reminded of Animal Mother). Vanya, on the other hand, hides behind an APC unwilling to shoot back. Sacha's soldier mentality is fully born out when he describes in detail how he will come back to the village and kill his captors. This message is presented to make him sound evil and bloodthirsty, and it also reminds us of a "Full Metal Jacket" character, the helicopter gunman who, when asked how he can shoot women and children responds, 'it's easy, you just don't lead them as much.' On the other hand, Vanya's affection towards his captors is glorified. He forms a bond with a young Chechen girl, fixes clocks for the villagers, and tries to understand their culture. The end is predictably self-serving; one guess as to who lives and who dies. That having been said, this bastardized version of Tolstoy's "A Prisoner in the Caucasus" is worth seeing.

    Like many other Russian films, the two main characters in `Prisoner of the Mountains' can be viewed as representative of the Russia that was and the Russia that is. Through their interactions with each other and the other characters in the movie, it is possible to draw conclusions about the state of the new Russia, the relationship between Old and New, and the problems and challenges that new Russia will face. Ivan, the young, innocent Russian soldier represents the new Russia. He is open, accepting, inexperienced, and most importantly, he is not filled with hate. The second Russian soldier in the film, Sasha, is the old Russia. He is experienced in war and killing; as he puts it, he did not start out a killer, but he learned to love it over time. He was not always so callus, but grew so because of his environment. He is hard, cold, and firmly believes in the limits that race and ethnicity place on people. These two are both captured, and as they spend time living amongst their captors, both seem to form relationships and bonds with them. Sasha, however, only does this to gain their trust, and without a moments hesitation kills Hasan, the mute, with whom he spent so much time. Ivan, on the other hand, creates genuine bonds, truly finding love with the young girl. Ivan is not caught up with the fact that his feelings are taboo; his young heart and his open mind do not have room for hate. Ivan is caught up in a war he has no part of; it is Sasha's war, not his. Because of the actions of Sasha, old Russia, the potential relationship between Ivan and the young girl, new Russia and Chechnya, is never realized. Ivan suffers because of the moves made on his behalf by the war mongering Sasha. Sasha has nothing to escape for, but he promises Ivan he will get him home. Sasha's method, however, only serves to worsen the situation. Even when Sasha is dead, it is too late for Ivan, the scars, distrust, and hatred run too deep to ever be mended, and new Russia is left dealing with the issues and hate it does understand that old Russia has left behind.

    Sergei Bodrov shows here that he is one of the most talented filmmakers in Russia today, with this riveting tale from the Chechen war. "Kavkazskij plennik" stars his own son Sergei jr. and Oleg Menshikov and both do a fabulous job as the Russian soldiers imprisoned by the Chechens in Caucasus. This movie is just what the world needed at such a time-an open hearted and humanistic telling about the evils of war and the uselesness of it all. Although the Russians can sometimes seem portrayed as the better side here and Chechens as ruthless, primitive, barbaric religious fanatics, the portrayal of the Russian commander quickly erases that impression. Here we see the laid back and careless attitude that mirrors the real Russian generals' attitude. The film is pretty tragic, from the death of Menshikov's character and to the tragic and unfortunate killing of Abdul-Murat's son, yet it leaves some hope in the end as Abdul-Murat shows pity for the young soldier whose mother has appealed for his release directly to him. But just as you think that this film will end well, the airplanes come. The ending is truly remarkable and well shot. It echoes the message of the absurdity of war and leaves us with little hope for the peace in the Caucasus.10 out of 10.

    In the war between Russia and Chechnya, the two Russian soldiers Sacha (Oleg Menshikov) and Vanya (Sergei Bodrov Jr.) are ambushed and made prisoners of war by a group of Chechens. The old man Abdul-Murat (Dzhemal Sikharulidze) wants to exchange them by his last son, who was arrested by the Russian troops. His other two sons were killed by the Russians, and his family is composed only by his teenager daughter Dina (Susanna Mekhraliyeva) and himself. The two soldiers are kept alive in his village, while Abdul tries to negotiate them with the Russian Commander Maslov (Aleksei Zharkov). Sacha and Vanya are very different persons and while together, they get closer. Sacha has the mentality of a soldier, intending to kill the Chechens from the village, while Vanya is a teacher and prefers to try to understand the locals behavior and culture, performing small jobs for them, like fixing clocks. Vanya falls in love with Dina. This beautiful movie is another magnificent anti-war movie. The touching story, supported by an excellent cast and the Caucasian locations, makes this movie a worthwhile entertainment. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): `Prisioneiros das Montanhas' (`Prisoners of the Mountains')

    Contains SPOILERS In this film, Bodrov goes beyond the anti-war dialog by portraying those who fight the war (at least on the Russian side) as the root cause of the problem. Although it contains many of the same elements as anti-war films produced in the United States, the dichotomy between the two prisoners, Sasha and Vanya, is unique. Introduced to the viewer in a scene in which their unit comes under fire, their reactions to the ambush establish their character differences. Sacha stands in the open, shooting from the hip at anything that moves with a crazed look on his face (anyone who has seen Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" will be reminded of Animal Mother). Vanya, on the other hand, hides behind an APC unwilling to shoot back. Sacha's soldier mentality is fully born out when he describes in detail how he will come back to the village and kill his captors. This message is presented to make him sound evil and bloodthirsty, and it also reminds us of a "Full Metal Jacket" character, the helicopter gunman who, when asked how he can shoot women and children responds, 'it's easy, you just don't lead them as much.' On the other hand, Vanya's affection towards his captors is glorified. He forms a bond with a young Chechen girl, fixes clocks for the villagers, and tries to understand their culture. The end is predictably self-serving; one guess as to who lives and who dies. That having been said, this bastardized version of Tolstoy's "A Prisoner in the Caucasus" is worth seeing.

    Like many other Russian films, the two main characters in `Prisoner of the Mountains' can be viewed as representative of the Russia that was and the Russia that is. Through their interactions with each other and the other characters in the movie, it is possible to draw conclusions about the state of the new Russia, the relationship between Old and New, and the problems and challenges that new Russia will face. Ivan, the young, innocent Russian soldier represents the new Russia. He is open, accepting, inexperienced, and most importantly, he is not filled with hate. The second Russian soldier in the film, Sasha, is the old Russia. He is experienced in war and killing; as he puts it, he did not start out a killer, but he learned to love it over time. He was not always so callus, but grew so because of his environment. He is hard, cold, and firmly believes in the limits that race and ethnicity place on people. These two are both captured, and as they spend time living amongst their captors, both seem to form relationships and bonds with them. Sasha, however, only does this to gain their trust, and without a moments hesitation kills Hasan, the mute, with whom he spent so much time. Ivan, on the other hand, creates genuine bonds, truly finding love with the young girl. Ivan is not caught up with the fact that his feelings are taboo; his young heart and his open mind do not have room for hate. Ivan is caught up in a war he has no part of; it is Sasha's war, not his. Because of the actions of Sasha, old Russia, the potential relationship between Ivan and the young girl, new Russia and Chechnya, is never realized. Ivan suffers because of the moves made on his behalf by the war mongering Sasha. Sasha has nothing to escape for, but he promises Ivan he will get him home. Sasha's method, however, only serves to worsen the situation. Even when Sasha is dead, it is too late for Ivan, the scars, distrust, and hatred run too deep to ever be mended, and new Russia is left dealing with the issues and hate it does understand that old Russia has left behind.

    Without doubt the dirtiest war of the late 20th Century was the war in Chechnya . It was actually two wars from 1994to 1996 and flared up in to a second war that lasted from 1999 to 2007 and even today there's acts of sporadic violence . The wars have cost the Russians as much as 8,000 military while the Chechens themselves may have lost 250,000 people both combatants and civilian , a quarter of the population of Chechnya . The worst thing is neither can claim any moral high ground . The Chechens may claim to be victims of genocide but any resistance that involves massacring civilians at Russian schools , cinemas and hospitals has a hard time of claiming victim hood The most compelling account of the conflict comes from the pen of Arkady Babchenko in his book One Soldier's War In Chechnya . It tells of his time as a conscript in the Russian army in the first war and of his time as a regular volunteer in the second war . What quickly becomes apparent is what a brutal institution the Russian army is . Recruits spend the first year of their service under " the rule of the grandfathers " soldiers in their second year where recruits are subject to effective slavery at its most brutal and unrelenting which will shock anyone who has any military understanding PRISONER OF THE MOUNTAINS is set during the first Chechen war where two Russian soldiers , Sgt Kostylin and Private Zhilin , are captured by rebels . The film does allude to the structural gulf between an experienced soldier like Kostylin and a recruit like Zhilin , the older soldier doesn't believe the Chechens will trade the recruit because he's unimportant to the Russian army but this is quickly forgotten about as the film moves in to predictable and simplistic territory that states that no matter the conflict and the uniforms we wear we are all human beings caught up in situations made by others It's a well enough made film but by the same token there's nothing outstanding about it either . There's also the problem that if you've read Babchenko's book featuring the very real atrocities each side has committed against the other - in fact each side also commits atrocities on their own - then it does have a rather Walt Disney feel

    The film is simple, powerful and convincing. Two Russian soldiers (Oleg Menshikov and Sergei Bodrov Jr.) are captured by a Chechen father (Dzhemal Sikharulidze) determined to exchange them for his son, but the prisoners escape. Prisoner Of The Mountains is an off-centre war story that concentrates less on the horror of conflict than the humanity, even across cultural and national divides, and successfully sustains interest. The film was awarded a Crystal Globe at the 1996 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, and the same year was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

    Based on a short story by the great writer Leo Tolstoy, Prisoner of the Mountains is a wonderful, bittersweet anti-war story directed by Sergei Bodrov. Two Russians soldiers - Sacha (Oleg Menshikov) and Vanya (Sergei Bodrov Jr.) are capture by Muslim rebels and brought to a remote village in the mountains, where Abdul-Murat (Jemal Sikharulidze) keeps them as hostages to exchange with his son, prisoner of the Russians. The relationship between the characters is the core of the movie. First, the camaraderie between the two prisoners. Sacha is older, bitter, cocky, whereas Vanya is young and naive. The two seem to have nothing in common apart for their situation, but they slowly bond; it might sound conventional but their growing friendship is written and acted so well that it doesn't come as clich&eacute;d at all. Even more interesting is the relationships between the two prisoners and their captors - Abdul-Murat, his young daughter Dina (the excellent Susanna Mekhralyeva) and their "guard", mute Hasan (Aleksandr Bureyev). A typical Hollywood movie would probably have made their interaction very sappy, but here the feeling of friendship between prisoners and captors - as they start to know each other - are portrayed in an understated, sober manner, and therefore are moving and touching; it never looks phony or sappy. The acting could not be better. Menshikov is perfect as the ironic Sacha; the actor makes him increasingly likable (as he bonds with Vanya and with the rebels) but never loses the character's edge. Likewise, Bodrov Jr. gives a vivid, sincere portrayal of the young, quiet Vanya. Sikharulidze plays Abdul-Murat as a cold and detached but decent and fair man who occasionally shows glimpses of kindness. And Mekhralyeva is magnificent as the young Dina - honestly one of the best performances from a child actress I have ever seen. Without spoiling anything, I'll say that the bittersweet ending is powerful, effective and memorable. A must-see 10/10

    As other have commented, the movie tries to apply a relatively even hand to both sides of the chechen conflict, possibly being a little more biased to the chechen point of view. What surprised me about this movie was that I came out of it more supportive of the Russian side of the conflict. Let me explain: Lets say you are a American living in present day Wyoming. Now imagine if there still existed unassimilated cheyenne indians in the area living out their old traditions and who would still periodically conduct war parties and scalp and kill anyone they found who was not a part of their tribe. If you are living in Wyoming, taking trips outside urbanized areas becomes quite harrowing. Such conditions would make one lose one's fascination of Indian culture quite rapidly. Present day conditions in the Caucauses are not so much different than the hypothetical example given above. These traditional Islamic cultures can be extraordinarily savage and haven't progressed much in the last 1000 years. The only current technology they have embraced is that which allows them to kill more people. The movie is well written and directed. It does try to be as honest as humanly possible with the subject matter. As a result, one is not preached to and allowed to make up their own mind, which is very rare in film.

    I rented this film expecting something a bit different - maybe something in the style of "Kukushka" - a story with a deep understanding of human nature, but with a feel good ending. I got an even better film. This film sneaked into my heart slowly and quietly. Like Vanya, I grew to understand and love its characters, regardless of "sides". As the plot developed, I understood how easy it was for one side to mistake the other one's intentions; how tradition, so important for people's cultural survival, ended up working against them, fueling the fire that perpetuated the hate; how one side's disregard about the other one's culture/mentality, and the stereotypical way of looking at the enemy added to the mistrust and hatred between both sides. The story is told with cinematic brilliance: simply, almost austerely, with tiny details that make the viewer grow an affectionate, understanding eye for the characters: little Dina, with her lonely, pure heart, adorning herself for Vanya and telling him about her grandmother's necklace, or explaining with the wisdom of a grown-up why she and he could never marry; the children and the Muslim soldiers dancing and playing according to their customs; tongueless Hassan; Vanya's mother hitting the Russian commander when she realizes his methods would get her son killed instead of rescued, dare-devil Sacha with his phlegmatic, humorous yet realistic view on life and war; the Russian Commander's appreciation for good quality food and vodka, etc. Then, there are the human interactions between the two sides: the Russian soldiers trading weapons for vodka with the enemy; the Muslim soldiers showing respect for the two Russian prisoners who managed to clear a road of mines and stay alive; Hassan procuring alcohol for the two prisoners and letting them dance and enjoy themselves, the Muslim villager asking Vanya to fix his clock... The cinematography is excellent; the beauty of the film comes not from any artificially enhanced imaging of the beautiful, harsh landscape, but from authenticity and masterful lens work. This film is unadulterated by big budget glitzy details; one almost feels is watching a documentary of the life in that part of the world, which makes the plot of the film hit like real events would and affect us almost as if we were on that mountain too. Many people are killed in this film, yet one feels there are no good or bad characters, only human beings locked in a conflict that perpetuates itself, because each side's quest for justice is confused with exacting retribution or revenge. Vanya and, eventually, Abdul see that, but like everyone else, they're prisoners of their own circumstances. The film's ending tore at my heart. As the helicopters were flying towards the village, I realized that was the only logical, true to life ending. A happy end that would please the viewer, where things were clarified and Abdul's final act of humanity and compassion was not fruitless, was not possible without turning the film into a fairy tale for adults. A complex, poignant story told in a masterful way.

    One might assume that the title refers only to the two Russian soldiers taken hostage by villagers in the Caucasus. But the Russian army has the village surrounded, so the townspeople are also prisoners. Moreover, each side is a prisoner of their own hate: the Russians can't see the villagers as humans and the villagers can't see the Russians as humans, thereby continuing the cycle of hate. Even the village elder is a prisoner of tradition: he uses a ceremonial knife for something in which he could have used a gun. All in all, "Kavkazskiy plennik" (called "Prisoner of the Mountains" in English) is a very well done movie. Oleg Menshikov and Sergei Bodrov Jr. do very well with their roles, and the situation in Chechnya makes the movie all the more relevant.
