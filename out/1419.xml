  Deceived that he had won the Prize, Connor MacLeod awakens from a peaceful life when an entombed immortal magician comes seeking the Highlander.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The third Highlander movie takes place at 1994, which means it's a prequel of the second film. After the death of his beloved wife Heather some centuries ago, Connor MacLeod left the highlands of Scotland and wandered around the world. Finally, he got to Japan, where he met the famous sorcerer Nakano, who was an Immortal too. Soon, they became friends, and Nakano taught Conor some tricks. But one day, an old enemy, Kane, came to Japan willing to find Nakano's cave and kill him. Although he succeeded, after cutting Nakano's head the mountain collapsed and Kane was trapped. Now, centuries after, an excavation reveals Nakano's cave...

    What can you say about the highlander sequels. Highlander II and Highlander the source are prime examples of complete cinematic failure and Highlander Endgame is just below average. I have heard a a lot of people say that this film is just terrible and barley any better than Highlander 2. This is a point I disagree with. While this movie has quiet a few problems, the biggest of which the story being almost completely duplicating the first. there are definitely are a few things that are good. What is good. In my humble opinion I think that that the performances are not half bad, both Christopher Lambert and Mario Van Peebles are good in their roles. The Special effects, While not great, are well used and fluid. And lastly the Action sequences a reasonably well done, while far from being the best ever put to screen they are o.k. As I said there are problems. The big one being, as I mentioned a bit further up, is the story. it is almost a complete copy of the first. Even a lot of the same things are done. such as the scene with Kane going in out of traffic with one of Conner's loved ones in the passenger seat. All in all this is not that bad a film but some people may have trouble sitting through it.

    Connor McLeod, the immortal highlander, seeks out an immortal master of illusion in order to learn the magician's art. He is unknowingly followed by an evil immortal, Kane, who want Connor's head. They fight and Connor gets away while Kane is trapped in a cave. Now in the present Connor's peace is destroyed once again as the evil Kane is released from his imprisonment and the struggle of the Gathering begins again. Using Connor's loved ones and his acquired powers of illusion, Kane lures Connor in for a fight where there can be only one winner..... So according to this movie, the second one didn't exist, and Connor is back on his own, and for some reason he has a son. I can't see why they ignored the second one, at least that has a talking point, and gets people irked for on reason or the other. This on the other hand is boring, and Peebles is so camp and over the top, he ruins the whole film. Lambert looks bored and misses Connery, and Unger, just does a diluted version of Madsen in part 2. I remember the poster for this in the UK 'Dazzling Special Effects' say Empire. I respect that magazine a lot, but whoa, we're they wrong with this. Even for 1994, they are the pits, Super Nintendo looked better than this. With this and the second one (which is gold compared to this)' this has to be one of the worst franchises ever made. It's ripe for a remake, and I hate remakes.

    Highlander 1 is a movie that should never have been considered for a sequel but unfortunately, executives wanted money so they pumped out as many sequels as they could, hoping the fans would like them. They didn't. Highlander 2 had WAY too many weaknesses. Setting Highlander in the future is really stupid and that movie said that they were from another planet. The director of THAT film saw the mess and tried to make a directors cut saying that Connor and Ramirez were exiles from the past which made me cringe even more. Then we have this. I will start with the compliments. The music is rather well scored and the fight sequences are - as usual - worth a watch and Christopher Lambert does the role of Connor justice as he does in the other 2 (he just needed a better script for the second one). Now the complaints. They introduce Sorcery in this film which destroys the first one because the premise of that universe is "Everything's normal except we have these immortals running around trying to cut off their head." They introduce a villain who has a deep voice and is like The Kurgan in the fact that he wants the prize that MacLeod apparently didn't get at the end of the first (???). The love interest happens to look like a girl that Connor bedded in the 1800's which destroys the character, Heather was his only love and when she died we are supposed to believe that Connor shut himself out from anyone else until Brenda Wyatt in 1986 New York. On that note where the hell was she in this? No information as to where she went, no "John, Take care of your mother". Overall this is a better sequel than "The Quickening" but its still crap.

    In my own words, I can say that this was a big improvement over Highlander 2. Its not as good as the first but a good solid entry into the Highlander saga. The story was OK, the cast was good, the special effects were still amazing and pretty much every way better than the previous crap movie. Christopher Lambert is back and he still has that glow for this character of Duncan Macleod. Now for the villain, Kane (not to be confused with the WWE superstar) he was a good villain but not as bad ass as Kurgan. Mario Van Peebles did a good job playing this relentless, cold-blooded, masochistic villain. Now for the female role, whoa! Deborah Unger! What can I say about her? Bold, Blonde, Beautiful and Banging! Now that's a major improvement over the other 2 female leads. (Not that it matters) Anyway, I do praise this movie for being a big improvement over the second film but its not as good as the original and others may not agree with me on this, but it is worth the time watching. This one was for the real highlander fans. Overall, 7 out of 10.

    As an uncorrectable "Highlander"-fan, I eyed the copy of "Highlander 3: The Sorcerer" with suspicion when it turned up in my video store. For one, the awfulness that was "Highlander 2: The Quickening" was still too fresh in one's mind. Secondly, there was no trace of Sean Connery (not that his presence saved "The Quickening", it merely alleviated). And thirdly, despite studying the cinema magazines (this was a time before IMDb, mind you) and being relatively up-to-date, I had not even heard about a third part being in production. The first reaction as the movie began: at least the tedious science-fiction storyline of "Quickening" was ignored, making this a prequel but despite ignoring "Quickening", "Quickening" had one advantage to "Sorcerer": it was real cinema while "The Sorcerer" reeks of television production, being shot on TV-sets that look like they were leftovers from a "McQuade"-episode. An action-franchise, be it "Highlander" or "James Bond" lives and dies through the villain and hence Mario Van Peebles, as villainous immortal Kane, is one of the film's biggest letdowns: Van Peebles mimics the original villain Kurgan one-to-one but where Clancy Brown came across as threatening and psychotic, Van Peebles grimacing and growling reminds us more of a Halloween-bogeyman, dressed up like Genghis Khan. Granted, all major villains of the "Highlander"-sequels have essentially been carbon-copies of The Kurgan but Van Peebles hams it up so badly, it's almost embarrassing. Even for "Highlander"-fans. "It's a kind of magic", was not only one of the catchphrases of the original, it was part of the concept and partial reason to it's success: what made those warriors immortal, why they had to fight and what the fabled prize would be, was pretty much left out or only hinted at in the original film. What killed the magic in "Highlander 2" was the attempt to explain the background and reasons  something the fan didn't actually want to have explained; what's killing the magic in "Highlander 3" is the actual depiction and use of magic. Perhaps the producers didn't realize it but the "Highlander"-fans didn't want magical gimmicks or sorcerers  they wanted immortal warriors who fought each other for reasons not known or understood. One was glad when *spoiler ahead* the evil Kane was finally beheaded  not so much because Connor McLeod prevailed (again) *spoiler end* but because the movie was finally over and that there would be no more sequels, like "Highlander: The Series", "Highlander: Endgame" or "Highlander 5: The Source", which one would inadvertently have to watch. Don't ask why  it seems to be a kind of magic.

    This is probably the second best of the movies, but it is a long way down from the original. All Highlander stories are best when they interweave stories from the past and the current day. This movie does not do this well. Also, spoiler alert!!! Do not read further if you do not want to read the spoilers. The plot lines set in the present day in this movie are almost the same as the present day section of the first movie. In both movies, The evil immortal hires a prostitute, terrifies somebody by driving wildly, Connor falls in love, Connor warns the woman to stay away, etc Also this movie lacks enough action scenes. Mario Van Peebles does a nice job of the playing the bad guy, but he is not nearly as scary as the Kurgan. Christopher Lambert seems to be doing this for paycheck and looks like he is just going through the motions. The script has many holes in it and does not seem to make much sense even in the Highlander world much less the real world.

    First of all, let's forget Highlander II: The Quickening ever existed. This is a great and logical sequel to the first Highlander movie. Highlander II was a complete disaster and all copies of that movie should be burned. This is a vital thing to keep in mind if you want to enjoy any Highlander movie. Of course I did not expect much of this movie since it has a 3.9/10 rating. I suppose most of you did not watch the entire movie or simply fast forwarded it because of the disaster that is The Quickening. Highlander III is a decent sequel and unfortunately does not get the credit it deserves. If you enjoyed Highlander, I'm sure you will enjoy Highlander III.

    From my point of view, this was an attempt to put back puzzle in normal after the terrible "Highlander 2 - The Quickening" sequel. Well, they did it, but still, the film is nothing special. What I like about is film... it has a very different way of telling story, different tempo of the proceeding through the film. In a way, it's a kind of lemonade film... a quite relaxing. Everything is relaxing and nothing special, just like some kind of TV film from "Hallmark", you know, when come back home, after the work, you eat something, than you sit back, or lie down on your favorite couch and you stumble upon this film, and then you just relax. Simply nothing is touching you so deep about this film, everything is hollow. Everything is like "oh, OK", "oh, they have a sword fight, right", "allrighty", "nothing here..." "that's good..." in kinda boring way. Actors: Christopher Lambert - wooden, doing nothing but talks like a bored Frenchman. Deborah Kara Unger - about her later. Just keep reading. Mario Van Peebles - his performance was funny, He keep it creepy and ugly, the way his character is supposed to be, well that's his way to perform it, his way to see this character, but it was weird that he keeps remind us on Kurgan, and that pig growls... damn... spit out those slimes from your throat... Jesus! Mako - His "guest role" was fine and relaxing as a great Japanese immortal sword master. And to mention Raoul Trujillo (warrior 2) from "Apocalypto" and "True Blood" season one (the Longshadow vampire dude), it was interesting to see him from his younger days. OK - now for the highlight of review... Probably the best thing in whole film, was no more or no less - the SEX scene! The sex scene between Christopher Lambert and Deborah Kara Unger was more than impressive! Wow, they did it without a double. That was a real talent between the two of them. Good movements and good "coreography" during the sexual "work", combined with a "f..kable music during the scene. The sex scene music was more than exciting, it's like... the band members were there, watching the horny couple and they composed the music on the spot and say, "allright, let's perform it!" Damn... that was good. Too bad I can't find a soundtrack. For me, this sex scene is 'number uno' in the motion picture history. The Best. About Deborah Kara Unger... her performance in film was so not interesting, that everybody expect thesame "Go on, Connor! F..k her!!!" YEeeeeeeeahhh!!!! They did it!! To mention about music, it was also a fine thing, it was good and relaxing. Highlander - The Sorcerer film is nothing more than, relax... take it easy... but you'll get horny during the sex scene he he.

    After all the hate for the second one, I suppose they just didn't want to take risks anymore. This sequel just screams mediocre. There's some cool stuff happening here and there, but all of it has been done already in the original. They even duplicated whole scenes just to be on the safe side. I really do wonder why "Highlander" ever bothered to have sequels in the first place, I know producers enjoy money but this story has been over for some time. So Highlander is at it again, fighting evil and killing immortals by cutting of their heads. If you can kill them, why the hell do they call them immortals? Either way, the action is quite nicely done, the fights have a nice choreography to them, the acting is just the right kind of bad. It stops there, because these good points don't really make for an entertaining movie. You'd think so but no. It's actually quite boring because this story is uninteresting as hell. So predictable, it's insane. Only real good part is the introduction, it pretty much sinks like a brick from there.

    After fans was disappointed with Highlander II: The Quickening William Panzer and Peter S. Davis decided to try again and make the true sequel to Highlander meaning Highlander III: The Sorcerer would have to disregard Highlander II: The Quickening, a movie which could be considered a stand alone film since it's plot completely changes the Highlander mythology. Highlander III: The Sorcerer does have some flaws, the main flaw is that this movie tries to hard to mimic the style of the original but lacks the punch that made the first film such a cult classic. A prime example is the main villain Kain, he seems like a rehashed version of the Kurgen. Mario Van Peebles is a great actor and does a good attempt at copying the Kurgan but sadly he can't match Clancy Brown's performance. Another example is the car scene where Kane tries to scare the kid by playing chicken with planes. It's just a copy of the scene in the original Highlander except changed slightly. The chemistry between Connor and Ramirez was one of the things that made Highlander so memorable. It was like a father and son relationship, sadly the chemistry between Connor and Nakano isn't the same. Mako does a great performance but sadly the film doesn't give him enough screen time, if the film delved deeper with the mentor training Connor it might of had the same power the original had. The flashback scenes are pulled off well giving the movie more depth. The training scene in Scottland is beautifully shot and the song "Bonny Portmore" definitely makes it more powerful. The sword fights are choreographed well and move at a good pace. The special effects are okay. The plot of Highlander III sees Connor MacLeod living with his adopted son John in Marakesh until an evil Immortal named Kane is released. Centuries ago Connor was training with a sorcerer named Nakano, Kain and his two henchmen stormed his hideout searching for Macleod. Nakano fought back but was killed by Kane, while absorbing the Quickening the cave collapsed. When Kane beheads one of his henchmen Connor senses it, so he decides to leave Marakesh and return to New York. The game is back on and the prize is at stake once again Highlander III: The Sorcerer lacks the charm of the original but despite it's flaws Highlander III is a watchable sequel.

    First of all, let's forget Highlander II: The Quickening ever existed. This is a great and logical sequel to the first Highlander movie. Highlander II was a complete disaster and all copies of that movie should be burned. This is a vital thing to keep in mind if you want to enjoy any Highlander movie. Of course I did not expect much of this movie since it has a 3.9/10 rating. I suppose most of you did not watch the entire movie or simply fast forwarded it because of the disaster that is The Quickening. Highlander III is a decent sequel and unfortunately does not get the credit it deserves. If you enjoyed Highlander, I'm sure you will enjoy Highlander III.

    From my point of view, this was an attempt to put back puzzle in normal after the terrible "Highlander 2 - The Quickening" sequel. Well, they did it, but still, the film is nothing special. What I like about is film... it has a very different way of telling story, different tempo of the proceeding through the film. In a way, it's a kind of lemonade film... a quite relaxing. Everything is relaxing and nothing special, just like some kind of TV film from "Hallmark", you know, when come back home, after the work, you eat something, than you sit back, or lie down on your favorite couch and you stumble upon this film, and then you just relax. Simply nothing is touching you so deep about this film, everything is hollow. Everything is like "oh, OK", "oh, they have a sword fight, right", "allrighty", "nothing here..." "that's good..." in kinda boring way. Actors: Christopher Lambert - wooden, doing nothing but talks like a bored Frenchman. Deborah Kara Unger - about her later. Just keep reading. Mario Van Peebles - his performance was funny, He keep it creepy and ugly, the way his character is supposed to be, well that's his way to perform it, his way to see this character, but it was weird that he keeps remind us on Kurgan, and that pig growls... damn... spit out those slimes from your throat... Jesus! Mako - His "guest role" was fine and relaxing as a great Japanese immortal sword master. And to mention Raoul Trujillo (warrior 2) from "Apocalypto" and "True Blood" season one (the Longshadow vampire dude), it was interesting to see him from his younger days. OK - now for the highlight of review... Probably the best thing in whole film, was no more or no less - the SEX scene! The sex scene between Christopher Lambert and Deborah Kara Unger was more than impressive! Wow, they did it without a double. That was a real talent between the two of them. Good movements and good "coreography" during the sexual "work", combined with a "f..kable music during the scene. The sex scene music was more than exciting, it's like... the band members were there, watching the horny couple and they composed the music on the spot and say, "allright, let's perform it!" Damn... that was good. Too bad I can't find a soundtrack. For me, this sex scene is 'number uno' in the motion picture history. The Best. About Deborah Kara Unger... her performance in film was so not interesting, that everybody expect thesame "Go on, Connor! F..k her!!!" YEeeeeeeeahhh!!!! They did it!! To mention about music, it was also a fine thing, it was good and relaxing. Highlander - The Sorcerer film is nothing more than, relax... take it easy... but you'll get horny during the sex scene he he.

    After all the hate for the second one, I suppose they just didn't want to take risks anymore. This sequel just screams mediocre. There's some cool stuff happening here and there, but all of it has been done already in the original. They even duplicated whole scenes just to be on the safe side. I really do wonder why "Highlander" ever bothered to have sequels in the first place, I know producers enjoy money but this story has been over for some time. So Highlander is at it again, fighting evil and killing immortals by cutting of their heads. If you can kill them, why the hell do they call them immortals? Either way, the action is quite nicely done, the fights have a nice choreography to them, the acting is just the right kind of bad. It stops there, because these good points don't really make for an entertaining movie. You'd think so but no. It's actually quite boring because this story is uninteresting as hell. So predictable, it's insane. Only real good part is the introduction, it pretty much sinks like a brick from there.

    After fans was disappointed with Highlander II: The Quickening William Panzer and Peter S. Davis decided to try again and make the true sequel to Highlander meaning Highlander III: The Sorcerer would have to disregard Highlander II: The Quickening, a movie which could be considered a stand alone film since it's plot completely changes the Highlander mythology. Highlander III: The Sorcerer does have some flaws, the main flaw is that this movie tries to hard to mimic the style of the original but lacks the punch that made the first film such a cult classic. A prime example is the main villain Kain, he seems like a rehashed version of the Kurgen. Mario Van Peebles is a great actor and does a good attempt at copying the Kurgan but sadly he can't match Clancy Brown's performance. Another example is the car scene where Kane tries to scare the kid by playing chicken with planes. It's just a copy of the scene in the original Highlander except changed slightly. The chemistry between Connor and Ramirez was one of the things that made Highlander so memorable. It was like a father and son relationship, sadly the chemistry between Connor and Nakano isn't the same. Mako does a great performance but sadly the film doesn't give him enough screen time, if the film delved deeper with the mentor training Connor it might of had the same power the original had. The flashback scenes are pulled off well giving the movie more depth. The training scene in Scottland is beautifully shot and the song "Bonny Portmore" definitely makes it more powerful. The sword fights are choreographed well and move at a good pace. The special effects are okay. The plot of Highlander III sees Connor MacLeod living with his adopted son John in Marakesh until an evil Immortal named Kane is released. Centuries ago Connor was training with a sorcerer named Nakano, Kain and his two henchmen stormed his hideout searching for Macleod. Nakano fought back but was killed by Kane, while absorbing the Quickening the cave collapsed. When Kane beheads one of his henchmen Connor senses it, so he decides to leave Marakesh and return to New York. The game is back on and the prize is at stake once again Highlander III: The Sorcerer lacks the charm of the original but despite it's flaws Highlander III is a watchable sequel.

    What can you say about the highlander sequels. Highlander II and Highlander the source are prime examples of complete cinematic failure and Highlander Endgame is just below average. I have heard a a lot of people say that this film is just terrible and barley any better than Highlander 2. This is a point I disagree with. While this movie has quiet a few problems, the biggest of which the story being almost completely duplicating the first. there are definitely are a few things that are good. What is good. In my humble opinion I think that that the performances are not half bad, both Christopher Lambert and Mario Van Peebles are good in their roles. The Special effects, While not great, are well used and fluid. And lastly the Action sequences a reasonably well done, while far from being the best ever put to screen they are o.k. As I said there are problems. The big one being, as I mentioned a bit further up, is the story. it is almost a complete copy of the first. Even a lot of the same things are done. such as the scene with Kane going in out of traffic with one of Conner's loved ones in the passenger seat. All in all this is not that bad a film but some people may have trouble sitting through it.

    Connor McLeod, the immortal highlander, seeks out an immortal master of illusion in order to learn the magician's art. He is unknowingly followed by an evil immortal, Kane, who want Connor's head. They fight and Connor gets away while Kane is trapped in a cave. Now in the present Connor's peace is destroyed once again as the evil Kane is released from his imprisonment and the struggle of the Gathering begins again. Using Connor's loved ones and his acquired powers of illusion, Kane lures Connor in for a fight where there can be only one winner..... So according to this movie, the second one didn't exist, and Connor is back on his own, and for some reason he has a son. I can't see why they ignored the second one, at least that has a talking point, and gets people irked for on reason or the other. This on the other hand is boring, and Peebles is so camp and over the top, he ruins the whole film. Lambert looks bored and misses Connery, and Unger, just does a diluted version of Madsen in part 2. I remember the poster for this in the UK 'Dazzling Special Effects' say Empire. I respect that magazine a lot, but whoa, we're they wrong with this. Even for 1994, they are the pits, Super Nintendo looked better than this. With this and the second one (which is gold compared to this)' this has to be one of the worst franchises ever made. It's ripe for a remake, and I hate remakes.

    Highlander 1 is a movie that should never have been considered for a sequel but unfortunately, executives wanted money so they pumped out as many sequels as they could, hoping the fans would like them. They didn't. Highlander 2 had WAY too many weaknesses. Setting Highlander in the future is really stupid and that movie said that they were from another planet. The director of THAT film saw the mess and tried to make a directors cut saying that Connor and Ramirez were exiles from the past which made me cringe even more. Then we have this. I will start with the compliments. The music is rather well scored and the fight sequences are - as usual - worth a watch and Christopher Lambert does the role of Connor justice as he does in the other 2 (he just needed a better script for the second one). Now the complaints. They introduce Sorcery in this film which destroys the first one because the premise of that universe is "Everything's normal except we have these immortals running around trying to cut off their head." They introduce a villain who has a deep voice and is like The Kurgan in the fact that he wants the prize that MacLeod apparently didn't get at the end of the first (???). The love interest happens to look like a girl that Connor bedded in the 1800's which destroys the character, Heather was his only love and when she died we are supposed to believe that Connor shut himself out from anyone else until Brenda Wyatt in 1986 New York. On that note where the hell was she in this? No information as to where she went, no "John, Take care of your mother". Overall this is a better sequel than "The Quickening" but its still crap.

    In my own words, I can say that this was a big improvement over Highlander 2. Its not as good as the first but a good solid entry into the Highlander saga. The story was OK, the cast was good, the special effects were still amazing and pretty much every way better than the previous crap movie. Christopher Lambert is back and he still has that glow for this character of Duncan Macleod. Now for the villain, Kane (not to be confused with the WWE superstar) he was a good villain but not as bad ass as Kurgan. Mario Van Peebles did a good job playing this relentless, cold-blooded, masochistic villain. Now for the female role, whoa! Deborah Unger! What can I say about her? Bold, Blonde, Beautiful and Banging! Now that's a major improvement over the other 2 female leads. (Not that it matters) Anyway, I do praise this movie for being a big improvement over the second film but its not as good as the original and others may not agree with me on this, but it is worth the time watching. This one was for the real highlander fans. Overall, 7 out of 10.

    As an uncorrectable "Highlander"-fan, I eyed the copy of "Highlander 3: The Sorcerer" with suspicion when it turned up in my video store. For one, the awfulness that was "Highlander 2: The Quickening" was still too fresh in one's mind. Secondly, there was no trace of Sean Connery (not that his presence saved "The Quickening", it merely alleviated). And thirdly, despite studying the cinema magazines (this was a time before IMDb, mind you) and being relatively up-to-date, I had not even heard about a third part being in production. The first reaction as the movie began: at least the tedious science-fiction storyline of "Quickening" was ignored, making this a prequel but despite ignoring "Quickening", "Quickening" had one advantage to "Sorcerer": it was real cinema while "The Sorcerer" reeks of television production, being shot on TV-sets that look like they were leftovers from a "McQuade"-episode. An action-franchise, be it "Highlander" or "James Bond" lives and dies through the villain and hence Mario Van Peebles, as villainous immortal Kane, is one of the film's biggest letdowns: Van Peebles mimics the original villain Kurgan one-to-one but where Clancy Brown came across as threatening and psychotic, Van Peebles grimacing and growling reminds us more of a Halloween-bogeyman, dressed up like Genghis Khan. Granted, all major villains of the "Highlander"-sequels have essentially been carbon-copies of The Kurgan but Van Peebles hams it up so badly, it's almost embarrassing. Even for "Highlander"-fans. "It's a kind of magic", was not only one of the catchphrases of the original, it was part of the concept and partial reason to it's success: what made those warriors immortal, why they had to fight and what the fabled prize would be, was pretty much left out or only hinted at in the original film. What killed the magic in "Highlander 2" was the attempt to explain the background and reasons  something the fan didn't actually want to have explained; what's killing the magic in "Highlander 3" is the actual depiction and use of magic. Perhaps the producers didn't realize it but the "Highlander"-fans didn't want magical gimmicks or sorcerers  they wanted immortal warriors who fought each other for reasons not known or understood. One was glad when *spoiler ahead* the evil Kane was finally beheaded  not so much because Connor McLeod prevailed (again) *spoiler end* but because the movie was finally over and that there would be no more sequels, like "Highlander: The Series", "Highlander: Endgame" or "Highlander 5: The Source", which one would inadvertently have to watch. Don't ask why  it seems to be a kind of magic.

    This is probably the second best of the movies, but it is a long way down from the original. All Highlander stories are best when they interweave stories from the past and the current day. This movie does not do this well. Also, spoiler alert!!! Do not read further if you do not want to read the spoilers. The plot lines set in the present day in this movie are almost the same as the present day section of the first movie. In both movies, The evil immortal hires a prostitute, terrifies somebody by driving wildly, Connor falls in love, Connor warns the woman to stay away, etc Also this movie lacks enough action scenes. Mario Van Peebles does a nice job of the playing the bad guy, but he is not nearly as scary as the Kurgan. Christopher Lambert seems to be doing this for paycheck and looks like he is just going through the motions. The script has many holes in it and does not seem to make much sense even in the Highlander world much less the real world.

Mario Van Peebles did a good job playing this relentless, cold-blooded, masochistic villain. Now for the female role, whoa! Deborah Unger! What can I say about her? Bold, Blonde, Beautiful and Banging! Now that's a major improvement over the other 2 female leads. (Not that it matters) Anyway, I do praise this movie for being a big improvement over the second film but its not as good as the original and others may not agree with me on this, but it is worth the time watching. This one was for the real highlander fans. Overall, 7 out of 10.

    As an uncorrectable "Highlander"-fan, I eyed the copy of "Highlander 3: The Sorcerer" with suspicion when it turned up in my video store. For one, the awfulness that was "Highlander 2: The Quickening" was still too fresh in one's mind. Secondly, there was no trace of Sean Connery (not that his presence saved "The Quickening", it merely alleviated). And thirdly, despite studying the cinema magazines (this was a time before IMDb, mind you) and being relatively up-to-date, I had not even heard about a third part being in production. The first reaction as the movie began: at least the tedious science-fiction storyline of "Quickening" was ignored, making this a prequel but despite ignoring "Quickening", "Quickening" had one advantage to "Sorcerer": it was real cinema while "The Sorcerer" reeks of television production, being shot on TV-sets that look like they were leftovers from a "McQuade"-episode. An action-franchise, be it "Highlander" or "James Bond" lives and dies through the villain and hence Mario Van Peebles, as villainous immortal Kane, is one of the film's biggest letdowns: Van Peebles mimics the original villain Kurgan one-to-one but where Clancy Brown came across as threatening and psychotic, Van Peebles grimacing and growling reminds us more of a Halloween-bogeyman, dressed up like Genghis Khan. Granted, all major villains of the "Highlander"-sequels have essentially been carbon-copies of The Kurgan but Van Peebles hams it up so badly, it's almost embarrassing. Even for "Highlander"-fans. "It's a kind of magic", was not only one of the catchphrases of the original, it was part of the concept and partial reason to it's success: what made those warriors immortal, why they had to fight and what the fabled prize would be, was pretty much left out or only hinted at in the original film. What killed the magic in "Highlander 2" was the attempt to explain the background and reasons  something the fan didn't actually want to have explained; what's killing the magic in "Highlander 3" is the actual depiction and use of magic. Perhaps the producers didn't realize it but the "Highlander"-fans didn't want magical gimmicks or sorcerers  they wanted immortal warriors who fought each other for reasons not known or understood. One was glad when *spoiler ahead* the evil Kane was finally beheaded  not so much because Connor McLeod prevailed (again) *spoiler end* but because the movie was finally over and that there would be no more sequels, like "Highlander: The Series", "Highlander: Endgame" or "Highlander 5: The Source", which one would inadvertently have to watch. Don't ask why  it seems to be a kind of magic.

    This is probably the second best of the movies, but it is a long way down from the original. All Highlander stories are best when they interweave stories from the past and the current day. This movie does not do this well. Also, spoiler alert!!! Do not read further if you do not want to read the spoilers. The plot lines set in the present day in this movie are almost the same as the present day section of the first movie. In both movies, The evil immortal hires a prostitute, terrifies somebody by driving wildly, Connor falls in love, Connor warns the woman to stay away, etc Also this movie lacks enough action scenes. Mario Van Peebles does a nice job of the playing the bad guy, but he is not nearly as scary as the Kurgan. Christopher Lambert seems to be doing this for paycheck and looks like he is just going through the motions. The script has many holes in it and does not seem to make much sense even in the Highlander world much less the real world.

    First of all, let's forget Highlander II: The Quickening ever existed. This is a great and logical sequel to the first Highlander movie. Highlander II was a complete disaster and all copies of that movie should be burned. This is a vital thing to keep in mind if you want to enjoy any Highlander movie. Of course I did not expect much of this movie since it has a 3.9/10 rating. I suppose most of you did not watch the entire movie or simply fast forwarded it because of the disaster that is The Quickening. Highlander III is a decent sequel and unfortunately does not get the credit it deserves. If you enjoyed Highlander, I'm sure you will enjoy Highlander III.

    From my point of view, this was an attempt to put back puzzle in normal after the terrible "Highlander 2 - The Quickening" sequel. Well, they did it, but still, the film is nothing special. What I like about is film... it has a very different way of telling story, different tempo of the proceeding through the film. In a way, it's a kind of lemonade film... a quite relaxing. Everything is relaxing and nothing special, just like some kind of TV film from "Hallmark", you know, when come back home, after the work, you eat something, than you sit back, or lie down on your favorite couch and you stumble upon this film, and then you just relax. Simply nothing is touching you so deep about this film, everything is hollow. Everything is like "oh, OK", "oh, they have a sword fight, right", "allrighty", "nothing here..." "that's good..." in kinda boring way. Actors: Christopher Lambert - wooden, doing nothing but talks like a bored Frenchman. Deborah Kara Unger - about her later. Just keep reading. Mario Van Peebles - his performance was funny, He keep it creepy and ugly, the way his character is supposed to be, well that's his way to perform it, his way to see this character, but it was weird that he keeps remind us on Kurgan, and that pig growls... damn... spit out those slimes from your throat... Jesus! Mako - His "guest role" was fine and relaxing as a great Japanese immortal sword master. And to mention Raoul Trujillo (warrior 2) from "Apocalypto" and "True Blood" season one (the Longshadow vampire dude), it was interesting to see him from his younger days. OK - now for the highlight of review... Probably the best thing in whole film, was no more or no less - the SEX scene! The sex scene between Christopher Lambert and Deborah Kara Unger was more than impressive! Wow, they did it without a double. That was a real talent between the two of them. Good movements and good "coreography" during the sexual "work", combined with a "f..kable music during the scene. The sex scene music was more than exciting, it's like... the band members were there, watching the horny couple and they composed the music on the spot and say, "allright, let's perform it!" Damn... that was good. Too bad I can't find a soundtrack. For me, this sex scene is 'number uno' in the motion picture history. The Best. About Deborah Kara Unger... her performance in film was so not interesting, that everybody expect thesame "Go on, Connor! F..k her!!!" YEeeeeeeeahhh!!!! They did it!! To mention about music, it was also a fine thing, it was good and relaxing. Highlander - The Sorcerer film is nothing more than, relax... take it easy... but you'll get horny during the sex scene he he.

    After all the hate for the second one, I suppose they just didn't want to take risks anymore. This sequel just screams mediocre. There's some cool stuff happening here and there, but all of it has been done already in the original. They even duplicated whole scenes just to be on the safe side. I really do wonder why "Highlander" ever bothered to have sequels in the first place, I know producers enjoy money but this story has been over for some time. So Highlander is at it again, fighting evil and killing immortals by cutting of their heads. If you can kill them, why the hell do they call them immortals? Either way, the action is quite nicely done, the fights have a nice choreography to them, the acting is just the right kind of bad. It stops there, because these good points don't really make for an entertaining movie. You'd think so but no. It's actually quite boring because this story is uninteresting as hell. So predictable, it's insane. Only real good part is the introduction, it pretty much sinks like a brick from there.

    After fans was disappointed with Highlander II: The Quickening William Panzer and Peter S. Davis decided to try again and make the true sequel to Highlander meaning Highlander III: The Sorcerer would have to disregard Highlander II: The Quickening, a movie which could be considered a stand alone film since it's plot completely changes the Highlander mythology. Highlander III: The Sorcerer does have some flaws, the main flaw is that this movie tries to hard to mimic the style of the original but lacks the punch that made the first film such a cult classic. A prime example is the main villain Kain, he seems like a rehashed version of the Kurgen. Mario Van Peebles is a great actor and does a good attempt at copying the Kurgan but sadly he can't match Clancy Brown's performance. Another example is the car scene where Kane tries to scare the kid by playing chicken with planes. It's just a copy of the scene in the original Highlander except changed slightly. The chemistry between Connor and Ramirez was one of the things that made Highlander so memorable. It was like a father and son relationship, sadly the chemistry between Connor and Nakano isn't the same. Mako does a great performance but sadly the film doesn't give him enough screen time, if the film delved deeper with the mentor training Connor it might of had the same power the original had. The flashback scenes are pulled off well giving the movie more depth. The training scene in Scottland is beautifully shot and the song "Bonny Portmore" definitely makes it more powerful. The sword fights are choreographed well and move at a good pace. The special effects are okay. The plot of Highlander III sees Connor MacLeod living with his adopted son John in Marakesh until an evil Immortal named Kane is released. Centuries ago Connor was training with a sorcerer named Nakano, Kain and his two henchmen stormed his hideout searching for Macleod. Nakano fought back but was killed by Kane, while absorbing the Quickening the cave collapsed. When Kane beheads one of his henchmen Connor senses it, so he decides to leave Marakesh and return to New York. The game is back on and the prize is at stake once again Highlander III: The Sorcerer lacks the charm of the original but despite it's flaws Highlander III is a watchable sequel.

    What can you say about the highlander sequels. Highlander II and Highlander the source are prime examples of complete cinematic failure and Highlander Endgame is just below average. I have heard a a lot of people say that this film is just terrible and barley any better than Highlander 2. This is a point I disagree with. While this movie has quiet a few problems, the biggest of which the story being almost completely duplicating the first. there are definitely are a few things that are good. What is good. In my humble opinion I think that that the performances are not half bad, both Christopher Lambert and Mario Van Peebles are good in their roles. The Special effects, While not great, are well used and fluid. And lastly the Action sequences a reasonably well done, while far from being the best ever put to screen they are o.k. As I said there are problems. The big one being, as I mentioned a bit further up, is the story. it is almost a complete copy of the first. Even a lot of the same things are done. such as the scene with Kane going in out of traffic with one of Conner's loved ones in the passenger seat. All in all this is not that bad a film but some people may have trouble sitting through it.

    Connor McLeod, the immortal highlander, seeks out an immortal master of illusion in order to learn the magician's art. He is unknowingly followed by an evil immortal, Kane, who want Connor's head. They fight and Connor gets away while Kane is trapped in a cave. Now in the present Connor's peace is destroyed once again as the evil Kane is released from his imprisonment and the struggle of the Gathering begins again. Using Connor's loved ones and his acquired powers of illusion, Kane lures Connor in for a fight where there can be only one winner..... So according to this movie, the second one didn't exist, and Connor is back on his own, and for some reason he has a son. I can't see why they ignored the second one, at least that has a talking point, and gets people irked for on reason or the other. This on the other hand is boring, and Peebles is so camp and over the top, he ruins the whole film. Lambert looks bored and misses Connery, and Unger, just does a diluted version of Madsen in part 2. I remember the poster for this in the UK 'Dazzling Special Effects' say Empire. I respect that magazine a lot, but whoa, we're they wrong with this. Even for 1994, they are the pits, Super Nintendo looked better than this. With this and the second one (which is gold compared to this)' this has to be one of the worst franchises ever made. It's ripe for a remake, and I hate remakes.

    Highlander 1 is a movie that should never have been considered for a sequel but unfortunately, executives wanted money so they pumped out as many sequels as they could, hoping the fans would like them. They didn't. Highlander 2 had WAY too many weaknesses. Setting Highlander in the future is really stupid and that movie said that they were from another planet. The director of THAT film saw the mess and tried to make a directors cut saying that Connor and Ramirez were exiles from the past which made me cringe even more. Then we have this. I will start with the compliments. The music is rather well scored and the fight sequences are - as usual - worth a watch and Christopher Lambert does the role of Connor justice as he does in the other 2 (he just needed a better script for the second one). Now the complaints. They introduce Sorcery in this film which destroys the first one because the premise of that universe is "Everything's normal except we have these immortals running around trying to cut off their head." They introduce a villain who has a deep voice and is like The Kurgan in the fact that he wants the prize that MacLeod apparently didn't get at the end of the first (???). The love interest happens to look like a girl that Connor bedded in the 1800's which destroys the character, Heather was his only love and when she died we are supposed to believe that Connor shut himself out from anyone else until Brenda Wyatt in 1986 New York. On that note where the hell was she in this? No information as to where she went, no "John, Take care of your mother". Overall this is a better sequel than "The Quickening" but its still crap.

    In my own words, I can say that this was a big improvement over Highlander 2. Its not as good as the first but a good solid entry into the Highlander saga. The story was OK, the cast was good, the special effects were still amazing and pretty much every way better than the previous crap movie. Christopher Lambert is back and he still has that glow for this character of Duncan Macleod. Now for the villain, Kane (not to be confused with the WWE superstar) he was a good villain but not as bad ass as Kurgan. Mario Van Peebles did a good job playing this relentless, cold-blooded, masochistic villain. Now for the female role, whoa! Deborah Unger! What can I say about her? Bold, Blonde, Beautiful and Banging! Now that's a major improvement over the other 2 female leads. (Not that it matters) Anyway, I do praise this movie for being a big improvement over the second film but its not as good as the original and others may not agree with me on this, but it is worth the time watching. This one was for the real highlander fans. Overall, 7 out of 10.

In my humble opinion I think that that the performances are not half bad, both Christopher Lambert and Mario Van Peebles are good in their roles. The Special effects, While not great, are well used and fluid. And lastly the Action sequences a reasonably well done, while far from being the best ever put to screen they are o.k. As I said there are problems. The big one being, as I mentioned a bit further up, is the story. it is almost a complete copy of the first. Even a lot of the same things are done. such as the scene with Kane going in out of traffic with one of Conner's loved ones in the passenger seat. All in all this is not that bad a film but some people may have trouble sitting through it.

    Connor McLeod, the immortal highlander, seeks out an immortal master of illusion in order to learn the magician's art. He is unknowingly followed by an evil immortal, Kane, who want Connor's head. They fight and Connor gets away while Kane is trapped in a cave. Now in the present Connor's peace is destroyed once again as the evil Kane is released from his imprisonment and the struggle of the Gathering begins again. Using Connor's loved ones and his acquired powers of illusion, Kane lures Connor in for a fight where there can be only one winner..... So according to this movie, the second one didn't exist, and Connor is back on his own, and for some reason he has a son. I can't see why they ignored the second one, at least that has a talking point, and gets people irked for on reason or the other. This on the other hand is boring, and Peebles is so camp and over the top, he ruins the whole film. Lambert looks bored and misses Connery, and Unger, just does a diluted version of Madsen in part 2. I remember the poster for this in the UK 'Dazzling Special Effects' say Empire. I respect that magazine a lot, but whoa, we're they wrong with this. Even for 1994, they are the pits, Super Nintendo looked better than this. With this and the second one (which is gold compared to this)' this has to be one of the worst franchises ever made. It's ripe for a remake, and I hate remakes.

    Highlander 1 is a movie that should never have been considered for a sequel but unfortunately, executives wanted money so they pumped out as many sequels as they could, hoping the fans would like them. They didn't. Highlander 2 had WAY too many weaknesses. Setting Highlander in the future is really stupid and that movie said that they were from another planet. The director of THAT film saw the mess and tried to make a directors cut saying that Connor and Ramirez were exiles from the past which made me cringe even more. Then we have this. I will start with the compliments. The music is rather well scored and the fight sequences are - as usual - worth a watch and Christopher Lambert does the role of Connor justice as he does in the other 2 (he just needed a better script for the second one). Now the complaints. They introduce Sorcery in this film which destroys the first one because the premise of that universe is "Everything's normal except we have these immortals running around trying to cut off their head." They introduce a villain who has a deep voice and is like The Kurgan in the fact that he wants the prize that MacLeod apparently didn't get at the end of the first (???). The love interest happens to look like a girl that Connor bedded in the 1800's which destroys the character, Heather was his only love and when she died we are supposed to believe that Connor shut himself out from anyone else until Brenda Wyatt in 1986 New York. On that note where the hell was she in this? No information as to where she went, no "John, Take care of your mother". Overall this is a better sequel than "The Quickening" but its still crap.

    In my own words, I can say that this was a big improvement over Highlander 2. Its not as good as the first but a good solid entry into the Highlander saga. The story was OK, the cast was good, the special effects were still amazing and pretty much every way better than the previous crap movie. Christopher Lambert is back and he still has that glow for this character of Duncan Macleod. Now for the villain, Kane (not to be confused with the WWE superstar) he was a good villain but not as bad ass as Kurgan. Mario Van Peebles did a good job playing this relentless, cold-blooded, masochistic villain. Now for the female role, whoa! Deborah Unger! What can I say about her? Bold, Blonde, Beautiful and Banging! Now that's a major improvement over the other 2 female leads. (Not that it matters) Anyway, I do praise this movie for being a big improvement over the second film but its not as good as the original and others may not agree with me on this, but it is worth the time watching. This one was for the real highlander fans. Overall, 7 out of 10.

    As an uncorrectable "Highlander"-fan, I eyed the copy of "Highlander 3: The Sorcerer" with suspicion when it turned up in my video store. For one, the awfulness that was "Highlander 2: The Quickening" was still too fresh in one's mind. Secondly, there was no trace of Sean Connery (not that his presence saved "The Quickening", it merely alleviated). And thirdly, despite studying the cinema magazines (this was a time before IMDb, mind you) and being relatively up-to-date, I had not even heard about a third part being in production. The first reaction as the movie began: at least the tedious science-fiction storyline of "Quickening" was ignored, making this a prequel but despite ignoring "Quickening", "Quickening" had one advantage to "Sorcerer": it was real cinema while "The Sorcerer" reeks of television production, being shot on TV-sets that look like they were leftovers from a "McQuade"-episode. An action-franchise, be it "Highlander" or "James Bond" lives and dies through the villain and hence Mario Van Peebles, as villainous immortal Kane, is one of the film's biggest letdowns: Van Peebles mimics the original villain Kurgan one-to-one but where Clancy Brown came across as threatening and psychotic, Van Peebles grimacing and growling reminds us more of a Halloween-bogeyman, dressed up like Genghis Khan. Granted, all major villains of the "Highlander"-sequels have essentially been carbon-copies of The Kurgan but Van Peebles hams it up so badly, it's almost embarrassing. Even for "Highlander"-fans. "It's a kind of magic", was not only one of the catchphrases of the original, it was part of the concept and partial reason to it's success: what made those warriors immortal, why they had to fight and what the fabled prize would be, was pretty much left out or only hinted at in the original film. What killed the magic in "Highlander 2" was the attempt to explain the background and reasons  something the fan didn't actually want to have explained; what's killing the magic in "Highlander 3" is the actual depiction and use of magic. Perhaps the producers didn't realize it but the "Highlander"-fans didn't want magical gimmicks or sorcerers  they wanted immortal warriors who fought each other for reasons not known or understood. One was glad when *spoiler ahead* the evil Kane was finally beheaded  not so much because Connor McLeod prevailed (again) *spoiler end* but because the movie was finally over and that there would be no more sequels, like "Highlander: The Series", "Highlander: Endgame" or "Highlander 5: The Source", which one would inadvertently have to watch. Don't ask why  it seems to be a kind of magic.

    This is probably the second best of the movies, but it is a long way down from the original. All Highlander stories are best when they interweave stories from the past and the current day. This movie does not do this well. Also, spoiler alert!!! Do not read further if you do not want to read the spoilers. The plot lines set in the present day in this movie are almost the same as the present day section of the first movie. In both movies, The evil immortal hires a prostitute, terrifies somebody by driving wildly, Connor falls in love, Connor warns the woman to stay away, etc Also this movie lacks enough action scenes. Mario Van Peebles does a nice job of the playing the bad guy, but he is not nearly as scary as the Kurgan. Christopher Lambert seems to be doing this for paycheck and looks like he is just going through the motions. The script has many holes in it and does not seem to make much sense even in the Highlander world much less the real world.

    First of all, let's forget Highlander II: The Quickening ever existed. This is a great and logical sequel to the first Highlander movie. Highlander II was a complete disaster and all copies of that movie should be burned. This is a vital thing to keep in mind if you want to enjoy any Highlander movie. Of course I did not expect much of this movie since it has a 3.9/10 rating. I suppose most of you did not watch the entire movie or simply fast forwarded it because of the disaster that is The Quickening. Highlander III is a decent sequel and unfortunately does not get the credit it deserves. If you enjoyed Highlander, I'm sure you will enjoy Highlander III.

    From my point of view, this was an attempt to put back puzzle in normal after the terrible "Highlander 2 - The Quickening" sequel. Well, they did it, but still, the film is nothing special. What I like about is film... it has a very different way of telling story, different tempo of the proceeding through the film. In a way, it's a kind of lemonade film... a quite relaxing. Everything is relaxing and nothing special, just like some kind of TV film from "Hallmark", you know, when come back home, after the work, you eat something, than you sit back, or lie down on your favorite couch and you stumble upon this film, and then you just relax. Simply nothing is touching you so deep about this film, everything is hollow. Everything is like "oh, OK", "oh, they have a sword fight, right", "allrighty", "nothing here..." "that's good..." in kinda boring way. Actors: Christopher Lambert - wooden, doing nothing but talks like a bored Frenchman. Deborah Kara Unger - about her later. Just keep reading. Mario Van Peebles - his performance was funny, He keep it creepy and ugly, the way his character is supposed to be, well that's his way to perform it, his way to see this character, but it was weird that he keeps remind us on Kurgan, and that pig growls... damn... spit out those slimes from your throat... Jesus! Mako - His "guest role" was fine and relaxing as a great Japanese immortal sword master. And to mention Raoul Trujillo (warrior 2) from "Apocalypto" and "True Blood" season one (the Longshadow vampire dude), it was interesting to see him from his younger days. OK - now for the highlight of review... Probably the best thing in whole film, was no more or no less - the SEX scene! The sex scene between Christopher Lambert and Deborah Kara Unger was more than impressive! Wow, they did it without a double. That was a real talent between the two of them. Good movements and good "coreography" during the sexual "work", combined with a "f..kable music during the scene. The sex scene music was more than exciting, it's like... the band members were there, watching the horny couple and they composed the music on the spot and say, "allright, let's perform it!" Damn... that was good. Too bad I can't find a soundtrack. For me, this sex scene is 'number uno' in the motion picture history. The Best. About Deborah Kara Unger... her performance in film was so not interesting, that everybody expect thesame "Go on, Connor! F..k her!!!" YEeeeeeeeahhh!!!! They did it!! To mention about music, it was also a fine thing, it was good and relaxing. Highlander - The Sorcerer film is nothing more than, relax... take it easy... but you'll get horny during the sex scene he he.

    After all the hate for the second one, I suppose they just didn't want to take risks anymore. This sequel just screams mediocre. There's some cool stuff happening here and there, but all of it has been done already in the original. They even duplicated whole scenes just to be on the safe side. I really do wonder why "Highlander" ever bothered to have sequels in the first place, I know producers enjoy money but this story has been over for some time. So Highlander is at it again, fighting evil and killing immortals by cutting of their heads. If you can kill them, why the hell do they call them immortals? Either way, the action is quite nicely done, the fights have a nice choreography to them, the acting is just the right kind of bad. It stops there, because these good points don't really make for an entertaining movie. You'd think so but no. It's actually quite boring because this story is uninteresting as hell. So predictable, it's insane. Only real good part is the introduction, it pretty much sinks like a brick from there.

    After fans was disappointed with Highlander II: The Quickening William Panzer and Peter S. Davis decided to try again and make the true sequel to Highlander meaning Highlander III: The Sorcerer would have to disregard Highlander II: The Quickening, a movie which could be considered a stand alone film since it's plot completely changes the Highlander mythology. Highlander III: The Sorcerer does have some flaws, the main flaw is that this movie tries to hard to mimic the style of the original but lacks the punch that made the first film such a cult classic. A prime example is the main villain Kain, he seems like a rehashed version of the Kurgen. Mario Van Peebles is a great actor and does a good attempt at copying the Kurgan but sadly he can't match Clancy Brown's performance. Another example is the car scene where Kane tries to scare the kid by playing chicken with planes. It's just a copy of the scene in the original Highlander except changed slightly. The chemistry between Connor and Ramirez was one of the things that made Highlander so memorable. It was like a father and son relationship, sadly the chemistry between Connor and Nakano isn't the same. Mako does a great performance but sadly the film doesn't give him enough screen time, if the film delved deeper with the mentor training Connor it might of had the same power the original had. The flashback scenes are pulled off well giving the movie more depth. The training scene in Scottland is beautifully shot and the song "Bonny Portmore" definitely makes it more powerful. The sword fights are choreographed well and move at a good pace. The special effects are okay. The plot of Highlander III sees Connor MacLeod living with his adopted son John in Marakesh until an evil Immortal named Kane is released. Centuries ago Connor was training with a sorcerer named Nakano, Kain and his two henchmen stormed his hideout searching for Macleod. Nakano fought back but was killed by Kane, while absorbing the Quickening the cave collapsed. When Kane beheads one of his henchmen Connor senses it, so he decides to leave Marakesh and return to New York. The game is back on and the prize is at stake once again Highlander III: The Sorcerer lacks the charm of the original but despite it's flaws Highlander III is a watchable sequel.

    What can you say about the highlander sequels. Highlander II and Highlander the source are prime examples of complete cinematic failure and Highlander Endgame is just below average. I have heard a a lot of people say that this film is just terrible and barley any better than Highlander 2. This is a point I disagree with. While this movie has quiet a few problems, the biggest of which the story being almost completely duplicating the first. there are definitely are a few things that are good. What is good.

Good movements and good "coreography" during the sexual "work", combined with a "f..kable music during the scene. The sex scene music was more than exciting, it's like... the band members were there, watching the horny couple and they composed the music on the spot and say, "allright, let's perform it!" Damn... that was good. Too bad I can't find a soundtrack. For me, this sex scene is 'number uno' in the motion picture history. The Best. About Deborah Kara Unger... her performance in film was so not interesting, that everybody expect thesame "Go on, Connor! F..k her!!!" YEeeeeeeeahhh!!!! They did it!! To mention about music, it was also a fine thing, it was good and relaxing. Highlander - The Sorcerer film is nothing more than, relax... take it easy... but you'll get horny during the sex scene he he.

    After all the hate for the second one, I suppose they just didn't want to take risks anymore. This sequel just screams mediocre. There's some cool stuff happening here and there, but all of it has been done already in the original. They even duplicated whole scenes just to be on the safe side. I really do wonder why "Highlander" ever bothered to have sequels in the first place, I know producers enjoy money but this story has been over for some time. So Highlander is at it again, fighting evil and killing immortals by cutting of their heads. If you can kill them, why the hell do they call them immortals? Either way, the action is quite nicely done, the fights have a nice choreography to them, the acting is just the right kind of bad. It stops there, because these good points don't really make for an entertaining movie. You'd think so but no. It's actually quite boring because this story is uninteresting as hell. So predictable, it's insane. Only real good part is the introduction, it pretty much sinks like a brick from there.

    After fans was disappointed with Highlander II: The Quickening William Panzer and Peter S. Davis decided to try again and make the true sequel to Highlander meaning Highlander III: The Sorcerer would have to disregard Highlander II: The Quickening, a movie which could be considered a stand alone film since it's plot completely changes the Highlander mythology. Highlander III: The Sorcerer does have some flaws, the main flaw is that this movie tries to hard to mimic the style of the original but lacks the punch that made the first film such a cult classic. A prime example is the main villain Kain, he seems like a rehashed version of the Kurgen. Mario Van Peebles is a great actor and does a good attempt at copying the Kurgan but sadly he can't match Clancy Brown's performance. Another example is the car scene where Kane tries to scare the kid by playing chicken with planes. It's just a copy of the scene in the original Highlander except changed slightly. The chemistry between Connor and Ramirez was one of the things that made Highlander so memorable. It was like a father and son relationship, sadly the chemistry between Connor and Nakano isn't the same. Mako does a great performance but sadly the film doesn't give him enough screen time, if the film delved deeper with the mentor training Connor it might of had the same power the original had. The flashback scenes are pulled off well giving the movie more depth. The training scene in Scottland is beautifully shot and the song "Bonny Portmore" definitely makes it more powerful. The sword fights are choreographed well and move at a good pace. The special effects are okay. The plot of Highlander III sees Connor MacLeod living with his adopted son John in Marakesh until an evil Immortal named Kane is released. Centuries ago Connor was training with a sorcerer named Nakano, Kain and his two henchmen stormed his hideout searching for Macleod. Nakano fought back but was killed by Kane, while absorbing the Quickening the cave collapsed. When Kane beheads one of his henchmen Connor senses it, so he decides to leave Marakesh and return to New York. The game is back on and the prize is at stake once again Highlander III: The Sorcerer lacks the charm of the original but despite it's flaws Highlander III is a watchable sequel.

    What can you say about the highlander sequels. Highlander II and Highlander the source are prime examples of complete cinematic failure and Highlander Endgame is just below average. I have heard a a lot of people say that this film is just terrible and barley any better than Highlander 2. This is a point I disagree with. While this movie has quiet a few problems, the biggest of which the story being almost completely duplicating the first. there are definitely are a few things that are good. What is good. In my humble opinion I think that that the performances are not half bad, both Christopher Lambert and Mario Van Peebles are good in their roles. The Special effects, While not great, are well used and fluid. And lastly the Action sequences a reasonably well done, while far from being the best ever put to screen they are o.k. As I said there are problems. The big one being, as I mentioned a bit further up, is the story. it is almost a complete copy of the first. Even a lot of the same things are done. such as the scene with Kane going in out of traffic with one of Conner's loved ones in the passenger seat. All in all this is not that bad a film but some people may have trouble sitting through it.

    Connor McLeod, the immortal highlander, seeks out an immortal master of illusion in order to learn the magician's art. He is unknowingly followed by an evil immortal, Kane, who want Connor's head. They fight and Connor gets away while Kane is trapped in a cave. Now in the present Connor's peace is destroyed once again as the evil Kane is released from his imprisonment and the struggle of the Gathering begins again. Using Connor's loved ones and his acquired powers of illusion, Kane lures Connor in for a fight where there can be only one winner..... So according to this movie, the second one didn't exist, and Connor is back on his own, and for some reason he has a son. I can't see why they ignored the second one, at least that has a talking point, and gets people irked for on reason or the other. This on the other hand is boring, and Peebles is so camp and over the top, he ruins the whole film. Lambert looks bored and misses Connery, and Unger, just does a diluted version of Madsen in part 2. I remember the poster for this in the UK 'Dazzling Special Effects' say Empire. I respect that magazine a lot, but whoa, we're they wrong with this. Even for 1994, they are the pits, Super Nintendo looked better than this. With this and the second one (which is gold compared to this)' this has to be one of the worst franchises ever made. It's ripe for a remake, and I hate remakes.

    Highlander 1 is a movie that should never have been considered for a sequel but unfortunately, executives wanted money so they pumped out as many sequels as they could, hoping the fans would like them. They didn't. Highlander 2 had WAY too many weaknesses. Setting Highlander in the future is really stupid and that movie said that they were from another planet. The director of THAT film saw the mess and tried to make a directors cut saying that Connor and Ramirez were exiles from the past which made me cringe even more. Then we have this. I will start with the compliments. The music is rather well scored and the fight sequences are - as usual - worth a watch and Christopher Lambert does the role of Connor justice as he does in the other 2 (he just needed a better script for the second one). Now the complaints. They introduce Sorcery in this film which destroys the first one because the premise of that universe is "Everything's normal except we have these immortals running around trying to cut off their head." They introduce a villain who has a deep voice and is like The Kurgan in the fact that he wants the prize that MacLeod apparently didn't get at the end of the first (???). The love interest happens to look like a girl that Connor bedded in the 1800's which destroys the character, Heather was his only love and when she died we are supposed to believe that Connor shut himself out from anyone else until Brenda Wyatt in 1986 New York. On that note where the hell was she in this? No information as to where she went, no "John, Take care of your mother". Overall this is a better sequel than "The Quickening" but its still crap.

    In my own words, I can say that this was a big improvement over Highlander 2. Its not as good as the first but a good solid entry into the Highlander saga. The story was OK, the cast was good, the special effects were still amazing and pretty much every way better than the previous crap movie. Christopher Lambert is back and he still has that glow for this character of Duncan Macleod. Now for the villain, Kane (not to be confused with the WWE superstar) he was a good villain but not as bad ass as Kurgan. Mario Van Peebles did a good job playing this relentless, cold-blooded, masochistic villain. Now for the female role, whoa! Deborah Unger! What can I say about her? Bold, Blonde, Beautiful and Banging! Now that's a major improvement over the other 2 female leads. (Not that it matters) Anyway, I do praise this movie for being a big improvement over the second film but its not as good as the original and others may not agree with me on this, but it is worth the time watching. This one was for the real highlander fans. Overall, 7 out of 10.

    As an uncorrectable "Highlander"-fan, I eyed the copy of "Highlander 3: The Sorcerer" with suspicion when it turned up in my video store. For one, the awfulness that was "Highlander 2: The Quickening" was still too fresh in one's mind. Secondly, there was no trace of Sean Connery (not that his presence saved "The Quickening", it merely alleviated). And thirdly, despite studying the cinema magazines (this was a time before IMDb, mind you) and being relatively up-to-date, I had not even heard about a third part being in production. The first reaction as the movie began: at least the tedious science-fiction storyline of "Quickening" was ignored, making this a prequel but despite ignoring "Quickening", "Quickening" had one advantage to "Sorcerer": it was real cinema while "The Sorcerer" reeks of television production, being shot on TV-sets that look like they were leftovers from a "McQuade"-episode. An action-franchise, be it "Highlander" or "James Bond" lives and dies through the villain and hence Mario Van Peebles, as villainous immortal Kane, is one of the film's biggest letdowns: Van Peebles mimics the original villain Kurgan one-to-one but where Clancy Brown came across as threatening and psychotic, Van Peebles grimacing and growling reminds us more of a Halloween-bogeyman, dressed up like Genghis Khan. Granted, all major villains of the "Highlander"-sequels have essentially been carbon-copies of The Kurgan but Van Peebles hams it up so badly, it's almost embarrassing. Even for "Highlander"-fans. "It's a kind of magic", was not only one of the catchphrases of the original, it was part of the concept and partial reason to it's success: what made those warriors immortal, why they had to fight and what the fabled prize would be, was pretty much left out or only hinted at in the original film. What killed the magic in "Highlander 2" was the attempt to explain the background and reasons  something the fan didn't actually want to have explained; what's killing the magic in "Highlander 3" is the actual depiction and use of magic. Perhaps the producers didn't realize it but the "Highlander"-fans didn't want magical gimmicks or sorcerers  they wanted immortal warriors who fought each other for reasons not known or understood. One was glad when *spoiler ahead* the evil Kane was finally beheaded  not so much because Connor McLeod prevailed (again) *spoiler end* but because the movie was finally over and that there would be no more sequels, like "Highlander: The Series", "Highlander: Endgame" or "Highlander 5: The Source", which one would inadvertently have to watch. Don't ask why  it seems to be a kind of magic.

    This is probably the second best of the movies, but it is a long way down from the original. All Highlander stories are best when they interweave stories from the past and the current day. This movie does not do this well. Also, spoiler alert!!! Do not read further if you do not want to read the spoilers. The plot lines set in the present day in this movie are almost the same as the present day section of the first movie. In both movies, The evil immortal hires a prostitute, terrifies somebody by driving wildly, Connor falls in love, Connor warns the woman to stay away, etc Also this movie lacks enough action scenes. Mario Van Peebles does a nice job of the playing the bad guy, but he is not nearly as scary as the Kurgan. Christopher Lambert seems to be doing this for paycheck and looks like he is just going through the motions. The script has many holes in it and does not seem to make much sense even in the Highlander world much less the real world.

    First of all, let's forget Highlander II: The Quickening ever existed. This is a great and logical sequel to the first Highlander movie. Highlander II was a complete disaster and all copies of that movie should be burned. This is a vital thing to keep in mind if you want to enjoy any Highlander movie. Of course I did not expect much of this movie since it has a 3.9/10 rating. I suppose most of you did not watch the entire movie or simply fast forwarded it because of the disaster that is The Quickening. Highlander III is a decent sequel and unfortunately does not get the credit it deserves. If you enjoyed Highlander, I'm sure you will enjoy Highlander III.

    From my point of view, this was an attempt to put back puzzle in normal after the terrible "Highlander 2 - The Quickening" sequel. Well, they did it, but still, the film is nothing special. What I like about is film... it has a very different way of telling story, different tempo of the proceeding through the film. In a way, it's a kind of lemonade film... a quite relaxing. Everything is relaxing and nothing special, just like some kind of TV film from "Hallmark", you know, when come back home, after the work, you eat something, than you sit back, or lie down on your favorite couch and you stumble upon this film, and then you just relax. Simply nothing is touching you so deep about this film, everything is hollow. Everything is like "oh, OK", "oh, they have a sword fight, right", "allrighty", "nothing here..." "that's good..." in kinda boring way. Actors: Christopher Lambert - wooden, doing nothing but talks like a bored Frenchman. Deborah Kara Unger - about her later. Just keep reading. Mario Van Peebles - his performance was funny, He keep it creepy and ugly, the way his character is supposed to be, well that's his way to perform it, his way to see this character, but it was weird that he keeps remind us on Kurgan, and that pig growls... damn... spit out those slimes from your throat... Jesus! Mako - His "guest role" was fine and relaxing as a great Japanese immortal sword master. And to mention Raoul Trujillo (warrior 2) from "Apocalypto" and "True Blood" season one (the Longshadow vampire dude), it was interesting to see him from his younger days. OK - now for the highlight of review... Probably the best thing in whole film, was no more or no less - the SEX scene! The sex scene between Christopher Lambert and Deborah Kara Unger was more than impressive! Wow, they did it without a double. That was a real talent between the two of them. Good movements and good "coreography" during the sexual "work", combined with a "f..kable music during the scene. The sex scene music was more than exciting, it's like... the band members were there, watching the horny couple and they composed the music on the spot and say, "allright, let's perform it!" Damn... that was good. Too bad I can't find a soundtrack. For me, this sex scene is 'number uno' in the motion picture history. The Best. About Deborah Kara Unger... her performance in film was so not interesting, that everybody expect thesame "Go on, Connor! F..k her!!!" YEeeeeeeeahhh!!!! They did it!! To mention about music, it was also a fine thing, it was good and relaxing. Highlander - The Sorcerer film is nothing more than, relax... take it easy... but you'll get horny during the sex scene he he.
