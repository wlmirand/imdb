    Black Beauty is one of the most touching movies that I have ever seen. You may think that it will be boring at first glance. Just another horse movie, right? Watch it. Do not question it, just watch. I can guarantee that you will, maybe not love it, but certainly find it enjoyable, even if you are not into horses. Black Beauty goes far beyond a simple horse story; it is a tale of hope, kindness, loss, betrayal, sorrow, and trust. The soundtrack brings out the emotional parts even more, creating a story that will move you deeply. There were two scenes that never fails to bring tears to my eyes, no matter how many times I watch it. I do not want to give too much away, in case somebody has not seen it yet, but the first of those scenes involves a bridge in a storm, and the other is the ending. I am in no way unemotional when I watch heart-warming movies, but it is a rare thing when they literally make me start crying. Those two scenes were beautifully done, and I would give the movie ten stars for them alone. However, the film was not without its flaws. Again, don't want to spoil too much, but there were several parts of the book that were not included in the movie when I wish they were, or changed when I would prefer that they were not, and some scenes feel a little rushed. That was why I bumped off one star. But it is certainly not a reason to push the movie aside. Even with those issues, it is still a great movie, and highly underrated in my opinion. I strongly recommend that you watch it and see what you think.

    I had heard of the novel but was not familiar with the actual story and didn't know it was about a horse's life from his perspective. It is beautifully and authentically shot, and has neither contrived animal cuteness nor a plot with contrived drama and sentimentality. Rather, you see the animals in their natural beauty as well as in difficult situations that you are made to see from their perspective. Horse life is shown in its raw state, both the exhilaration and the brutality. I about balled my eyes out on this film. If you don't at least choke up a little, you may need to pinch yourself to see if you're alive. I did have some good laughs too. Honestly I don't know how they got many of the animal shots.

    I loved the movie! I'm a big horse lover. A very good movie for anyone that likes horses. It was a very nice story told from the horses point of view. The music and the scenery were both beautiful. This is a movie for all ages that captivates the young and the old. If this movie was made in Hollywood they would some how find a way to ruin it but instead was made in England. The English always seem to make nice movies like this without over doing it. The movie as one would expect does not have a lot of action sequences to it. Instead the movie relies on good story telling supported with excellent acting. The scenes with the English county side are beautiful. I would watch again and recommend it to all.

    'Black Beauty' is such a brilliant film, and when I asked my friend if he had seen it, and he said no because it was a 'horsey' movie and they were always the exact same. I was actually quite angered at this statement, Black beauty is a different film all together. The film comparison with the book, was quite clear, while the story line was there, some of the message, that the author 'Anna Sewell' wrote the novel for, was lost in the film. The author originally wrote the book, to make people aware of the brutality and cruelty that was thrust upon horses in those days. Though the director (Caroline Thompson)demonstrated the message, through the bearing reins, whipping and jumps racing (where they raced ginger before she was fit). In the novel there are many events where they come along a horse and rider, who is being cruel, and help the horse. In the film there is no mention of that. Although all in all, it was a great film, and the voice-over of 'Alan Cumming' suited the film the butter to bread, it was his smooth real voice that you would believe, was the very voice inside Beauty's head. The characters well fitted there description in the novel, although what was lost was the story of ginger when she was younger, and how she was treated so badly. As well as the story of the old war horse 'Captain'. The film toys with your emotions and does bring a tear to your eye. twas the first film that actually made me cry, one of the favorites and ALWAYS will be.

    Black Beauty was so beautiful and moving. I recently saw it again - had not seen it for years. It makes me cry. It is so sad and moving. It even made my husband cry. And if you love horses as much as I do, it's the absolute best horse movie. So much more realistic than the other horses movies, even Secretariat. It was wonderfully authentic and so REAL - what a wonderful job these folks did of making a horse movie that I can believe. The scenes of Beauty and Ginger and Merrylegs and amazing and I loved them - my husband did too. If this movie doesn't get to you, then no movie can. The scenes of the countryside and I assume England are lovely. It's just a great movie. Thank you for this heartwarming movie.

    The performances have a reverent authenticity in this screen adaptation of the classic Anna Sewell novel. There are other screen versions of this film ( possibly some of them yet to come), but this is the only one I have seen thus far, and I found it to be enlightening. While not completely faithful to the book ( possibly due to time and attention constraints), it does a respectable job of giving us the story from the horse's P.O.V., and I think it's probably easier for an animal to get inside of the head of a human than for a human to truly get inside of the mind of the animal--at least in life terms--but this is a very watchable movie. Some of you may want to have hankies and buckets at hand...it can be a tear-jerker at moments. I delayed watching the film because, sometimes, if it's told from the human perspective, it can get pretty mushy and sentimental...but this one is rather balanced, trying more to get the points and morals across than using sentiment as a weapon or a shield. I recommend it for the entire family.

    There are so many things to love about Black Beauty. It is a truly beautiful, moving film, and do I think it is underrated? Yes I do and unjustly so. For one thing, Black Beauty is just amazing to look at. The cinematography was just tremendous throughout and the scenery was magnificent. The costumes were lovingly designed, and on the whole the period detail was flawless. Caroline Thompson's screenplay also deserves credit. The book is a timeless literary classic, and out of the numerous adaptations of the book, this is the truest. The screenplay itself is enough to evoke tears, Black Beauty's inner thoughts especially were so beautifully written. And she does a remarkable job directing as well. Danny Elfman is one of my favourite film composers, his score for Edward Scissorhands is still one of the most beautiful scores I have ever heard in a film. His score here is just as effective, it never affects the quiet composition of the film, as a matter of fact the tone of it is just right. The acting from Sean Bean, David Thewlis, Peter Cook and Eleanor Bron is all top notch, but the real star of the show is Black Beauty himself, though all the horses look superb. I also thought that Alan Cumming's voice for Black Beauty was perfect, very sensitive and melodious as it should be. The film is so beautiful and has a lot of poignant moments and an unexpected soft centre. If I had one minor quibble, and it is ever so minor, it is that the film is too short. Other than that beautiful; I remember sort of liking the 1971 film, but it didn't have the emotional impact that this adaptation did on me. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    This is perhaps one of the most moving and beautiful films I have ever seen. I first saw it probably 10+ years ago when my daughter was little and crazy about horses. I had read "Black Beauty" as a child and it was one of my favorite books. So I was looking forward to seeing it but really wasn't expecting much - just a children's film about an old childhood favorite. Boy, was I surprised. This movie was such a moving film. I still remember it this many years later. (I did also recently watch it again). But from memory, the thing that stood out most to me was the superb narration by Scotish actor Alan Cumming as he brings Black Beauty to life. His voice lent so much charm and personality to the entire film. Usually I'm not a fan of accents as it can make the movie harder to understand. But his enunciation was so clear as to not be a problem. He truly MAKES the film. His voice is so rich, with layers and textures. An American narrator couldn't have possibly been nearly as effective. I'm glad this film didn't go with the special effects to make it look like the animals mouths moved when they talked - it would have cheapened the film and it is much more beautiful the way it feels like you are listening to Black Beaauty's thoughts. The other stand out feature is the musical score and sound effects. I can't believe they were overlooked for any awards. The film wouldn't have been 1/10th the experience without it - it is that integral to the whole atmosphere. Listen for how they use breathing and other sound effects to bring the horses to life - especially when Black Beauty was sick. Another time, when Beauty is teasing Jerry and steals his bread - listen when he brings it back to Jerry. I am almost certain Beauty laughs - in a horse whinny kind of way! Usually, I would comment on the cast - but here, the most important ones are the horses. So I guess kudos go to the trainers and director in getting such great footage of them on film. There are times when they are racing through pastures, or rearing up on their hind legs so that it appears as though they are dancing. And with the beautiful music playing alongside - it is truly magic. The film does great justice to Anne Sewell's original novel of BLACK BEAUTY (1878). It's unfortunate she never lived to see the great success her novel achieved - as she died just 3 months after it was published. This film will definitely pull at your heartstrings. Have the tissues handy, especially if you are an animal-lover. There are great themes of love and loyalty, trust and betrayal. The film will have you laughing, smiling with pure joy, and crying. It ends on a high note with more great scenes of Beauty racing through pastures, reflected in the pond like a dream. Don't miss this one!

    I love this film and have seen it a few times. I am totally prejudiced because I live on a horse ranch with four horses and mine is an ex-stallion big (16h3) and, oh yeah, he's black. You've got to give the film and the story some room and accept the anthropomorphic horse driven narrative. The story has all the highs and lows of cinematic drama without dipping into melodrama for more than a moment or two. There are several versions of the book and this is the best production and the most emotional. If you like Old Yeller or The Yearling and you have some Kleenex nearby and want to get completely lost in a wonderful epic of a horse's life and horses he encounters and all the people he crosses paths with then grab some popcorn and your tissues and saddle up with this great movie.

    This is perhaps one of the most moving and beautiful films I have ever seen. I first saw it probably 10+ years ago when my daughter was little and crazy about horses. I had read "Black Beauty" as a child and it was one of my favorite books. So I was looking forward to seeing it but really wasn't expecting much - just a children's film about an old childhood favorite. Boy, was I surprised. This movie was such a moving film. I still remember it this many years later. (I did also recently watch it again). But from memory, the thing that stood out most to me was the superb narration by Scotish actor Alan Cumming as he brings Black Beauty to life. His voice lent so much charm and personality to the entire film. Usually I'm not a fan of accents as it can make the movie harder to understand. But his enunciation was so clear as to not be a problem. He truly MAKES the film. His voice is so rich, with layers and textures. An American narrator couldn't have possibly been nearly as effective. I'm glad this film didn't go with the special effects to make it look like the animals mouths moved when they talked - it would have cheapened the film and it is much more beautiful the way it feels like you are listening to Black Beaauty's thoughts. The other stand out feature is the musical score and sound effects. I can't believe they were overlooked for any awards. The film wouldn't have been 1/10th the experience without it - it is that integral to the whole atmosphere. Listen for how they use breathing and other sound effects to bring the horses to life - especially when Black Beauty was sick. Another time, when Beauty is teasing Jerry and steals his bread - listen when he brings it back to Jerry. I am almost certain Beauty laughs - in a horse whinny kind of way! Usually, I would comment on the cast - but here, the most important ones are the horses. So I guess kudos go to the trainers and director in getting such great footage of them on film. There are times when they are racing through pastures, or rearing up on their hind legs so that it appears as though they are dancing. And with the beautiful music playing alongside - it is truly magic. The film does great justice to Anne Sewell's original novel of BLACK BEAUTY (1878). It's unfortunate she never lived to see the great success her novel achieved - as she died just 3 months after it was published. This film will definitely pull at your heartstrings. Have the tissues handy, especially if you are an animal-lover. There are great themes of love and loyalty, trust and betrayal. The film will have you laughing, smiling with pure joy, and crying. It ends on a high note with more great scenes of Beauty racing through pastures, reflected in the pond like a dream. Don't miss this one!

    I love this film and have seen it a few times. I am totally prejudiced because I live on a horse ranch with four horses and mine is an ex-stallion big (16h3) and, oh yeah, he's black. You've got to give the film and the story some room and accept the anthropomorphic horse driven narrative. The story has all the highs and lows of cinematic drama without dipping into melodrama for more than a moment or two. There are several versions of the book and this is the best production and the most emotional. If you like Old Yeller or The Yearling and you have some Kleenex nearby and want to get completely lost in a wonderful epic of a horse's life and horses he encounters and all the people he crosses paths with then grab some popcorn and your tissues and saddle up with this great movie.

    Black Beauty is one of the most touching movies that I have ever seen. You may think that it will be boring at first glance. Just another horse movie, right? Watch it. Do not question it, just watch. I can guarantee that you will, maybe not love it, but certainly find it enjoyable, even if you are not into horses. Black Beauty goes far beyond a simple horse story; it is a tale of hope, kindness, loss, betrayal, sorrow, and trust. The soundtrack brings out the emotional parts even more, creating a story that will move you deeply. There were two scenes that never fails to bring tears to my eyes, no matter how many times I watch it. I do not want to give too much away, in case somebody has not seen it yet, but the first of those scenes involves a bridge in a storm, and the other is the ending. I am in no way unemotional when I watch heart-warming movies, but it is a rare thing when they literally make me start crying. Those two scenes were beautifully done, and I would give the movie ten stars for them alone. However, the film was not without its flaws. Again, don't want to spoil too much, but there were several parts of the book that were not included in the movie when I wish they were, or changed when I would prefer that they were not, and some scenes feel a little rushed. That was why I bumped off one star. But it is certainly not a reason to push the movie aside. Even with those issues, it is still a great movie, and highly underrated in my opinion. I strongly recommend that you watch it and see what you think.

    I had heard of the novel but was not familiar with the actual story and didn't know it was about a horse's life from his perspective. It is beautifully and authentically shot, and has neither contrived animal cuteness nor a plot with contrived drama and sentimentality. Rather, you see the animals in their natural beauty as well as in difficult situations that you are made to see from their perspective. Horse life is shown in its raw state, both the exhilaration and the brutality. I about balled my eyes out on this film. If you don't at least choke up a little, you may need to pinch yourself to see if you're alive. I did have some good laughs too. Honestly I don't know how they got many of the animal shots.

    I loved the movie! I'm a big horse lover. A very good movie for anyone that likes horses. It was a very nice story told from the horses point of view. The music and the scenery were both beautiful. This is a movie for all ages that captivates the young and the old. If this movie was made in Hollywood they would some how find a way to ruin it but instead was made in England. The English always seem to make nice movies like this without over doing it. The movie as one would expect does not have a lot of action sequences to it. Instead the movie relies on good story telling supported with excellent acting. The scenes with the English county side are beautiful. I would watch again and recommend it to all.

    'Black Beauty' is such a brilliant film, and when I asked my friend if he had seen it, and he said no because it was a 'horsey' movie and they were always the exact same. I was actually quite angered at this statement, Black beauty is a different film all together. The film comparison with the book, was quite clear, while the story line was there, some of the message, that the author 'Anna Sewell' wrote the novel for, was lost in the film. The author originally wrote the book, to make people aware of the brutality and cruelty that was thrust upon horses in those days. Though the director (Caroline Thompson)demonstrated the message, through the bearing reins, whipping and jumps racing (where they raced ginger before she was fit). In the novel there are many events where they come along a horse and rider, who is being cruel, and help the horse. In the film there is no mention of that. Although all in all, it was a great film, and the voice-over of 'Alan Cumming' suited the film the butter to bread, it was his smooth real voice that you would believe, was the very voice inside Beauty's head. The characters well fitted there description in the novel, although what was lost was the story of ginger when she was younger, and how she was treated so badly. As well as the story of the old war horse 'Captain'. The film toys with your emotions and does bring a tear to your eye. twas the first film that actually made me cry, one of the favorites and ALWAYS will be.

    Black Beauty was so beautiful and moving. I recently saw it again - had not seen it for years. It makes me cry. It is so sad and moving. It even made my husband cry. And if you love horses as much as I do, it's the absolute best horse movie. So much more realistic than the other horses movies, even Secretariat. It was wonderfully authentic and so REAL - what a wonderful job these folks did of making a horse movie that I can believe. The scenes of Beauty and Ginger and Merrylegs and amazing and I loved them - my husband did too. If this movie doesn't get to you, then no movie can. The scenes of the countryside and I assume England are lovely. It's just a great movie. Thank you for this heartwarming movie.

    The performances have a reverent authenticity in this screen adaptation of the classic Anna Sewell novel. There are other screen versions of this film ( possibly some of them yet to come), but this is the only one I have seen thus far, and I found it to be enlightening. While not completely faithful to the book ( possibly due to time and attention constraints), it does a respectable job of giving us the story from the horse's P.O.V., and I think it's probably easier for an animal to get inside of the head of a human than for a human to truly get inside of the mind of the animal--at least in life terms--but this is a very watchable movie. Some of you may want to have hankies and buckets at hand...it can be a tear-jerker at moments. I delayed watching the film because, sometimes, if it's told from the human perspective, it can get pretty mushy and sentimental...but this one is rather balanced, trying more to get the points and morals across than using sentiment as a weapon or a shield. I recommend it for the entire family.

    There are so many things to love about Black Beauty. It is a truly beautiful, moving film, and do I think it is underrated? Yes I do and unjustly so. For one thing, Black Beauty is just amazing to look at. The cinematography was just tremendous throughout and the scenery was magnificent. The costumes were lovingly designed, and on the whole the period detail was flawless. Caroline Thompson's screenplay also deserves credit. The book is a timeless literary classic, and out of the numerous adaptations of the book, this is the truest. The screenplay itself is enough to evoke tears, Black Beauty's inner thoughts especially were so beautifully written. And she does a remarkable job directing as well. Danny Elfman is one of my favourite film composers, his score for Edward Scissorhands is still one of the most beautiful scores I have ever heard in a film. His score here is just as effective, it never affects the quiet composition of the film, as a matter of fact the tone of it is just right. The acting from Sean Bean, David Thewlis, Peter Cook and Eleanor Bron is all top notch, but the real star of the show is Black Beauty himself, though all the horses look superb. I also thought that Alan Cumming's voice for Black Beauty was perfect, very sensitive and melodious as it should be. The film is so beautiful and has a lot of poignant moments and an unexpected soft centre. If I had one minor quibble, and it is ever so minor, it is that the film is too short. Other than that beautiful; I remember sort of liking the 1971 film, but it didn't have the emotional impact that this adaptation did on me. 10/10 Bethany Cox

I'm glad this film didn't go with the special effects to make it look like the animals mouths moved when they talked - it would have cheapened the film and it is much more beautiful the way it feels like you are listening to Black Beaauty's thoughts. The other stand out feature is the musical score and sound effects. I can't believe they were overlooked for any awards. The film wouldn't have been 1/10th the experience without it - it is that integral to the whole atmosphere. Listen for how they use breathing and other sound effects to bring the horses to life - especially when Black Beauty was sick. Another time, when Beauty is teasing Jerry and steals his bread - listen when he brings it back to Jerry. I am almost certain Beauty laughs - in a horse whinny kind of way!

    There are so many things to love about Black Beauty. It is a truly beautiful, moving film, and do I think it is underrated? Yes I do and unjustly so. For one thing, Black Beauty is just amazing to look at. The cinematography was just tremendous throughout and the scenery was magnificent. The costumes were lovingly designed, and on the whole the period detail was flawless. Caroline Thompson's screenplay also deserves credit. The book is a timeless literary classic, and out of the numerous adaptations of the book, this is the truest. The screenplay itself is enough to evoke tears, Black Beauty's inner thoughts especially were so beautifully written. And she does a remarkable job directing as well. Danny Elfman is one of my favourite film composers, his score for Edward Scissorhands is still one of the most beautiful scores I have ever heard in a film. His score here is just as effective, it never affects the quiet composition of the film, as a matter of fact the tone of it is just right. The acting from Sean Bean, David Thewlis, Peter Cook and Eleanor Bron is all top notch, but the real star of the show is Black Beauty himself, though all the horses look superb. I also thought that Alan Cumming's voice for Black Beauty was perfect, very sensitive and melodious as it should be. The film is so beautiful and has a lot of poignant moments and an unexpected soft centre. If I had one minor quibble, and it is ever so minor, it is that the film is too short. Other than that beautiful; I remember sort of liking the 1971 film, but it didn't have the emotional impact that this adaptation did on me. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    This is perhaps one of the most moving and beautiful films I have ever seen. I first saw it probably 10+ years ago when my daughter was little and crazy about horses. I had read "Black Beauty" as a child and it was one of my favorite books. So I was looking forward to seeing it but really wasn't expecting much - just a children's film about an old childhood favorite. Boy, was I surprised. This movie was such a moving film. I still remember it this many years later. (I did also recently watch it again). But from memory, the thing that stood out most to me was the superb narration by Scotish actor Alan Cumming as he brings Black Beauty to life. His voice lent so much charm and personality to the entire film. Usually I'm not a fan of accents as it can make the movie harder to understand. But his enunciation was so clear as to not be a problem. He truly MAKES the film. His voice is so rich, with layers and textures. An American narrator couldn't have possibly been nearly as effective. I'm glad this film didn't go with the special effects to make it look like the animals mouths moved when they talked - it would have cheapened the film and it is much more beautiful the way it feels like you are listening to Black Beaauty's thoughts. The other stand out feature is the musical score and sound effects. I can't believe they were overlooked for any awards. The film wouldn't have been 1/10th the experience without it - it is that integral to the whole atmosphere. Listen for how they use breathing and other sound effects to bring the horses to life - especially when Black Beauty was sick. Another time, when Beauty is teasing Jerry and steals his bread - listen when he brings it back to Jerry. I am almost certain Beauty laughs - in a horse whinny kind of way! Usually, I would comment on the cast - but here, the most important ones are the horses. So I guess kudos go to the trainers and director in getting such great footage of them on film. There are times when they are racing through pastures, or rearing up on their hind legs so that it appears as though they are dancing. And with the beautiful music playing alongside - it is truly magic. The film does great justice to Anne Sewell's original novel of BLACK BEAUTY (1878). It's unfortunate she never lived to see the great success her novel achieved - as she died just 3 months after it was published. This film will definitely pull at your heartstrings. Have the tissues handy, especially if you are an animal-lover. There are great themes of love and loyalty, trust and betrayal. The film will have you laughing, smiling with pure joy, and crying. It ends on a high note with more great scenes of Beauty racing through pastures, reflected in the pond like a dream. Don't miss this one!

    I love this film and have seen it a few times. I am totally prejudiced because I live on a horse ranch with four horses and mine is an ex-stallion big (16h3) and, oh yeah, he's black. You've got to give the film and the story some room and accept the anthropomorphic horse driven narrative. The story has all the highs and lows of cinematic drama without dipping into melodrama for more than a moment or two. There are several versions of the book and this is the best production and the most emotional. If you like Old Yeller or The Yearling and you have some Kleenex nearby and want to get completely lost in a wonderful epic of a horse's life and horses he encounters and all the people he crosses paths with then grab some popcorn and your tissues and saddle up with this great movie.

    Black Beauty is one of the most touching movies that I have ever seen. You may think that it will be boring at first glance. Just another horse movie, right? Watch it. Do not question it, just watch. I can guarantee that you will, maybe not love it, but certainly find it enjoyable, even if you are not into horses. Black Beauty goes far beyond a simple horse story; it is a tale of hope, kindness, loss, betrayal, sorrow, and trust. The soundtrack brings out the emotional parts even more, creating a story that will move you deeply. There were two scenes that never fails to bring tears to my eyes, no matter how many times I watch it. I do not want to give too much away, in case somebody has not seen it yet, but the first of those scenes involves a bridge in a storm, and the other is the ending. I am in no way unemotional when I watch heart-warming movies, but it is a rare thing when they literally make me start crying. Those two scenes were beautifully done, and I would give the movie ten stars for them alone. However, the film was not without its flaws. Again, don't want to spoil too much, but there were several parts of the book that were not included in the movie when I wish they were, or changed when I would prefer that they were not, and some scenes feel a little rushed. That was why I bumped off one star. But it is certainly not a reason to push the movie aside. Even with those issues, it is still a great movie, and highly underrated in my opinion. I strongly recommend that you watch it and see what you think.

    I had heard of the novel but was not familiar with the actual story and didn't know it was about a horse's life from his perspective. It is beautifully and authentically shot, and has neither contrived animal cuteness nor a plot with contrived drama and sentimentality. Rather, you see the animals in their natural beauty as well as in difficult situations that you are made to see from their perspective. Horse life is shown in its raw state, both the exhilaration and the brutality. I about balled my eyes out on this film. If you don't at least choke up a little, you may need to pinch yourself to see if you're alive. I did have some good laughs too. Honestly I don't know how they got many of the animal shots.

    I loved the movie! I'm a big horse lover. A very good movie for anyone that likes horses. It was a very nice story told from the horses point of view. The music and the scenery were both beautiful. This is a movie for all ages that captivates the young and the old. If this movie was made in Hollywood they would some how find a way to ruin it but instead was made in England. The English always seem to make nice movies like this without over doing it. The movie as one would expect does not have a lot of action sequences to it. Instead the movie relies on good story telling supported with excellent acting. The scenes with the English county side are beautiful. I would watch again and recommend it to all.

    'Black Beauty' is such a brilliant film, and when I asked my friend if he had seen it, and he said no because it was a 'horsey' movie and they were always the exact same. I was actually quite angered at this statement, Black beauty is a different film all together. The film comparison with the book, was quite clear, while the story line was there, some of the message, that the author 'Anna Sewell' wrote the novel for, was lost in the film. The author originally wrote the book, to make people aware of the brutality and cruelty that was thrust upon horses in those days. Though the director (Caroline Thompson)demonstrated the message, through the bearing reins, whipping and jumps racing (where they raced ginger before she was fit). In the novel there are many events where they come along a horse and rider, who is being cruel, and help the horse. In the film there is no mention of that. Although all in all, it was a great film, and the voice-over of 'Alan Cumming' suited the film the butter to bread, it was his smooth real voice that you would believe, was the very voice inside Beauty's head. The characters well fitted there description in the novel, although what was lost was the story of ginger when she was younger, and how she was treated so badly. As well as the story of the old war horse 'Captain'. The film toys with your emotions and does bring a tear to your eye. twas the first film that actually made me cry, one of the favorites and ALWAYS will be.

    Black Beauty was so beautiful and moving. I recently saw it again - had not seen it for years. It makes me cry. It is so sad and moving. It even made my husband cry. And if you love horses as much as I do, it's the absolute best horse movie. So much more realistic than the other horses movies, even Secretariat. It was wonderfully authentic and so REAL - what a wonderful job these folks did of making a horse movie that I can believe. The scenes of Beauty and Ginger and Merrylegs and amazing and I loved them - my husband did too. If this movie doesn't get to you, then no movie can. The scenes of the countryside and I assume England are lovely. It's just a great movie. Thank you for this heartwarming movie.

    The performances have a reverent authenticity in this screen adaptation of the classic Anna Sewell novel. There are other screen versions of this film ( possibly some of them yet to come), but this is the only one I have seen thus far, and I found it to be enlightening. While not completely faithful to the book ( possibly due to time and attention constraints), it does a respectable job of giving us the story from the horse's P.O.V., and I think it's probably easier for an animal to get inside of the head of a human than for a human to truly get inside of the mind of the animal--at least in life terms--but this is a very watchable movie. Some of you may want to have hankies and buckets at hand...it can be a tear-jerker at moments. I delayed watching the film because, sometimes, if it's told from the human perspective, it can get pretty mushy and sentimental...but this one is rather balanced, trying more to get the points and morals across than using sentiment as a weapon or a shield. I recommend it for the entire family.

And if you love horses as much as I do, it's the absolute best horse movie. So much more realistic than the other horses movies, even Secretariat. It was wonderfully authentic and so REAL - what a wonderful job these folks did of making a horse movie that I can believe. The scenes of Beauty and Ginger and Merrylegs and amazing and I loved them - my husband did too. If this movie doesn't get to you, then no movie can. The scenes of the countryside and I assume England are lovely. It's just a great movie. Thank you for this heartwarming movie.

    The performances have a reverent authenticity in this screen adaptation of the classic Anna Sewell novel. There are other screen versions of this film ( possibly some of them yet to come), but this is the only one I have seen thus far, and I found it to be enlightening. While not completely faithful to the book ( possibly due to time and attention constraints), it does a respectable job of giving us the story from the horse's P.O.V., and I think it's probably easier for an animal to get inside of the head of a human than for a human to truly get inside of the mind of the animal--at least in life terms--but this is a very watchable movie. Some of you may want to have hankies and buckets at hand...it can be a tear-jerker at moments. I delayed watching the film because, sometimes, if it's told from the human perspective, it can get pretty mushy and sentimental...but this one is rather balanced, trying more to get the points and morals across than using sentiment as a weapon or a shield. I recommend it for the entire family.

    There are so many things to love about Black Beauty. It is a truly beautiful, moving film, and do I think it is underrated? Yes I do and unjustly so. For one thing, Black Beauty is just amazing to look at. The cinematography was just tremendous throughout and the scenery was magnificent. The costumes were lovingly designed, and on the whole the period detail was flawless. Caroline Thompson's screenplay also deserves credit. The book is a timeless literary classic, and out of the numerous adaptations of the book, this is the truest. The screenplay itself is enough to evoke tears, Black Beauty's inner thoughts especially were so beautifully written. And she does a remarkable job directing as well. Danny Elfman is one of my favourite film composers, his score for Edward Scissorhands is still one of the most beautiful scores I have ever heard in a film. His score here is just as effective, it never affects the quiet composition of the film, as a matter of fact the tone of it is just right. The acting from Sean Bean, David Thewlis, Peter Cook and Eleanor Bron is all top notch, but the real star of the show is Black Beauty himself, though all the horses look superb. I also thought that Alan Cumming's voice for Black Beauty was perfect, very sensitive and melodious as it should be. The film is so beautiful and has a lot of poignant moments and an unexpected soft centre. If I had one minor quibble, and it is ever so minor, it is that the film is too short. Other than that beautiful; I remember sort of liking the 1971 film, but it didn't have the emotional impact that this adaptation did on me. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    This is perhaps one of the most moving and beautiful films I have ever seen. I first saw it probably 10+ years ago when my daughter was little and crazy about horses. I had read "Black Beauty" as a child and it was one of my favorite books. So I was looking forward to seeing it but really wasn't expecting much - just a children's film about an old childhood favorite. Boy, was I surprised. This movie was such a moving film. I still remember it this many years later. (I did also recently watch it again). But from memory, the thing that stood out most to me was the superb narration by Scotish actor Alan Cumming as he brings Black Beauty to life. His voice lent so much charm and personality to the entire film. Usually I'm not a fan of accents as it can make the movie harder to understand. But his enunciation was so clear as to not be a problem. He truly MAKES the film. His voice is so rich, with layers and textures. An American narrator couldn't have possibly been nearly as effective. I'm glad this film didn't go with the special effects to make it look like the animals mouths moved when they talked - it would have cheapened the film and it is much more beautiful the way it feels like you are listening to Black Beaauty's thoughts. The other stand out feature is the musical score and sound effects. I can't believe they were overlooked for any awards. The film wouldn't have been 1/10th the experience without it - it is that integral to the whole atmosphere. Listen for how they use breathing and other sound effects to bring the horses to life - especially when Black Beauty was sick. Another time, when Beauty is teasing Jerry and steals his bread - listen when he brings it back to Jerry. I am almost certain Beauty laughs - in a horse whinny kind of way! Usually, I would comment on the cast - but here, the most important ones are the horses. So I guess kudos go to the trainers and director in getting such great footage of them on film. There are times when they are racing through pastures, or rearing up on their hind legs so that it appears as though they are dancing. And with the beautiful music playing alongside - it is truly magic. The film does great justice to Anne Sewell's original novel of BLACK BEAUTY (1878). It's unfortunate she never lived to see the great success her novel achieved - as she died just 3 months after it was published. This film will definitely pull at your heartstrings. Have the tissues handy, especially if you are an animal-lover. There are great themes of love and loyalty, trust and betrayal. The film will have you laughing, smiling with pure joy, and crying. It ends on a high note with more great scenes of Beauty racing through pastures, reflected in the pond like a dream. Don't miss this one!

    I love this film and have seen it a few times. I am totally prejudiced because I live on a horse ranch with four horses and mine is an ex-stallion big (16h3) and, oh yeah, he's black. You've got to give the film and the story some room and accept the anthropomorphic horse driven narrative. The story has all the highs and lows of cinematic drama without dipping into melodrama for more than a moment or two. There are several versions of the book and this is the best production and the most emotional. If you like Old Yeller or The Yearling and you have some Kleenex nearby and want to get completely lost in a wonderful epic of a horse's life and horses he encounters and all the people he crosses paths with then grab some popcorn and your tissues and saddle up with this great movie.
