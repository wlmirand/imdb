 <sinopse>
  Two strangers, whose paths are always crossing, finally meet when fate steps in.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Gwen grows up with her romantic mother constantly telling her the story of her courtship and marriage to her father. Nick grows up with an alcoholic father who can't hold a job and whose family, as a result, is forced to move all the time. The two are shaped by this - Gwen a romantic and Nick withdrawn, unsure of himself - as they watch the hugely popular sixties sitcom, "One Big Happy Family." Years later, it is the star of that show, now a child actor gone bad with a history of detox and people always saying, "I thought she was dead," Francesca Lanfield, who connects the two of them, after years of near-misses and almost encounters. Gwen is hired to ghost-write Francesca's autobiography, while Nick, becoming her lover, is the architect who is to design a building on Francesca's property. When Gwen decides to crusade to save Francesca's building, she writes letters to the newspaper which catches Nick's attention - and wins his heart.

    I saw this movie last night on DVD and was shocked to find it has such a low rating. We enjoyed it very much, it has an interesting story, is funny, and has a fine cast. It begins in the early 1960s and we see two key characters, a young boy and a young girl, in the same school and both destined to become musicians, but never really being friends. We somehow sense that there may be a future together for these two. Most of the movie is set in the current time, which was 1997. The characters are in their mid-30s and still struggling to find their destiny in life. One of those two young students grew up to be Jeanne Tripplehorn as Gwen Moss, a writer who loves to write poetry but makes her living ghost-writing for others. In that regard she gets hooked up with Sarah Jessica Parker as Francesca Lanfield who grew up on camera in a family TV show "One Big Happy Family". The other young student grew up to be Dylan McDermott as Nick, an architect with an unusual style. Although he got in a bit of hot water with his boss for going out on his own to design an unusual restaurant, when Francesca finds out he was the architect she insisted that he lead a new project that involved her. Jennifer Aniston, before she became famous, has a smaller part as Gwen's friend, Debbie. Good movie, we enjoyed it.

    I own a copy of this movie and loaned it out to various movie-loving coworkers, telling them nothing about it in advance and asking them to only to 'rate it on a scale of 1-10'. Sadly, of a group of 10 different viewers, it rated an average of '3'; most thought it was awful. Only one of the 10 recognized the brilliance of this title. The irony, the ongoing parallel construction, the 'pay attention to the details' element. I'm pretty sure this story will go on to be a sort of "It's a Wonderful Life" type of film; an initial box office disappointment that is rediscovered many years later. The running gag about cigarette smoking alone sets it apart from all other movies. It's a breath of fresh air in the formulaic approach of movie making. Quirky and odd as it may be, its message of 'love will find a way' (in spite of our disruption) registered a connection in me; "in the end it always works out; don't give up".

    Stories intertwine through our lives, around life events, past our passions, and a few stories themselves remind us of this. "'Til There Was You" makes this self-conscious storytelling into a delightful journey. Two journeys, in fact, because it takes the title literally. Two fascinating people (writer Jeanne Tripplehorn, architect Dylan McDermott) are shown growing up and constantly seeking passion and connection in their lives, but finding no way to hold on to either. When a bit of serendipity comes along, they both are transformed: An historic and almost otherworldly Los Angeles apartment house shows magic and belonging to her, substance and commitment to him. The ironies lie in her defending it in anonymous letters, his falling in love with the letters while designing the building's replacement, the building being owned by his lover, whose book is being ghostwritten by ... but you may get the idea. The writer and the architect are woven together by ties and resonances they cannot imagine, and yet they've never even (formally) met. It's a rich, intricate, hilarious, and wry screenplay, written by a principal writer of "thirtysomething" and writer/creator of "My So-Called Life." The acting is touching and passionate, especially when one realizes that it's two connecting love stories - about learning to love and respect yourself, before you can find the serendipities of life. This isn't a conventional romantic comedy or drama. The couple isn't what is important here. The individuals are. In "The Fountainhead," Ayn Rand wrote: "To say 'I love you,' one must know first how to say the 'I.'" These characters don't know, at first, but they're open to life, and they find out, playing with and against friends, neighbors, and lovers. Their journey is what will enthrall you. The ending almost doesn't matter. See this, on cable or disc, and give it your full attention. You will be rewarded!

    Gwen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) is a romantic dreamer, encouraged by her mother, but she is disappointed in love time and again. Nick (Dylan McDermott) grew up in a dysfunctional family and, consequently, wears no rose colored glasses to look upon life and romance. There is one common denominator between the two of them, they both loved a "Brady Bunch" type show called One Big Happy Family when they were young. The child star of the show, Francesca Lanfield (Sarah Jessica Parker), grew up to be a troubled adult, with drug problems, who now lives on investments that were made for her during her young acting days. Thus, she owns a beautiful old apartment building in Los Angeles, which once housed Louise Brooks, and where Gwen now resides, that she is selling for big bucks. The plan is to raze the building and erect something new. As luck would have it, Nick is the architect of the project and Francesca likes what she sees and the two start a sexually-charged thing. The "luck" continues when Gwen, an author, is assigned to ghost write Francesca's autobiography. Thus, the two of them have connections to Francesca, a happening to add to the string of chance meetings and near misses between Nick and Gwen throughout their lives. As Gwen fights for her beloved building, Nick has second thoughts about his role in its destruction and Francesca remains a petulant, mostly unlovable eccentric, how will the film play out? This is a sweet story with attractive, talented performers but its pace is so slow that some viewers may turn it off. Certainly, Tripplehorn, McDermott, and Parker give nice performances, especially Parker, who makes a believable, mixed-up child star all grown up. Then, too, the L.A. scenery, costumes, and amenities are fine indeed. But, the script, which contains many good ideas and themes, moves along very slowly and the direction is far from snappy as well. Therefore, if you love romantic dramas, especially those that sport beautiful actors, do make time for this one. It has a nice tale to tell, even as it takes what seems like a decade to tell it.

    I was channel surfing when I happened to catch this movie and, after it was over, it really got me to think about life - and how small things can change the way it turns out to be, and how inter-connected we all are. It was quite funny to watch Nick and Gwen always managing to miss each other. I think the acting could have been a bit better though - especially Jennifer Aniston not having a role at all was quite disappointing. However, this was the first movie in which I really loved Sarah Jessica Parker. She managed to do a whole range of emotions with seeming ease. I can't understand why it didn't do well at the box office. I hadn't seen it before, but have been recommending it to friends ever since. On the whole a really good movie.

    I caught this on TV last night(sans ad-breaks), and I have to say, I liked it a lot. I had tried to watch it a few times before on TV, but had never really got hooked into the story enough to stick with it until the end. I'm glad I did now. I hate Sex And The City, especially SJP's character in it, but she was great in this movie. And (gulp!) very sexy in it. Must have been the Bob. Jean Tripplehorn is very underrated, and has had some casting misfortunes in the past, which have overshadowed her talent and potential. Even though her character here was for the most part a little distant and icy, she still managed to bring a bit of warmth to the part. And she's also extremely attractive, which never hurts. Jen Aniston "didnt play Rachel", which was a good thing. The supporting cast did their jobs well, and Dylan McDermott? Well, you either like him or you loathe him, I have found. I thought he was quite watchable in this. I was amused to see reviewers on here, knocking the film because people smoked in it. Honestly, I don't understand what that has to do with a film's artistic merit. On matters like smoking and drug use, some of our members(non-UK, usually) tend to let their right wing views tarnish their opinions of a film. Which is, as they say on message boards, "Retarded". Take a chance and see this film. It's not Con Air, but it has a story, characters, and lots of smoking. (irony) Which is wrong, as Jesus doesn't like smoking. Or homosexuals(/irony). 7.5 out of 10, Goodnight.

    The comments here seem to indicate a preference for the movie not reflected in the overall rating of below 5. I think that's because the people who love the film are answering a perceived wrong, that critics/viewers want a typical romantic comedy storyline, that completely misses the point. The reason this film is not good is the basics: story details and acting. I actually think the major lead roles were miscast--too old to be college students, or even young professionals (it was hard to tell exactly how old they were supposed to be throughout the movie), and not entirely convincing in their performances. But then the story details were not all there. I liked the concept of the random connections the main characters shared, and didn't have a problem at all with the fact that they didn't meet until the end (although I agree with another reviewer in that I would have liked to have seen something more than just 1st meeting directly to 10+ years later with a child). But it was not very well executed, and details fell through the cracks. Many of the minor characters were so 2-dimensional. Jennifer Aniston's "best friend" character was hardly given a chance to develop. The saving grace of this film for me was Sarah Jessica Parker, who was able to cover a range of behaviors so believably in a character that had the potential for caricature.

    This may contain spoilers, depending on your definition of the word "spoiler" You've been warned. Being a rather large fan of Winnie Holzman's writing (and a fan of the work she and Scott Winant have done for the Bedford Falls Company), I may be slightly biased regarding this film, but I honestly feel that 'Til There Was You is highly underrated. The few reviews that I've seen site the film's major flaw as a lack of direct interaction between the two protagonists, Gwen and Nick. In my opinion, the authors of said reviews were obviously looking for a stereotypical romantic comedy storyline. That's not what this film offers. Instead, it takes a more realistic approach to the relationships between its main characters. An approach that is round-about and does not offer the quick rewards of a Nora Ephron insta-relationship (try You've Got Mail, if that's what you're looking for--typical romantic comedy but with panache). A major point of 'Til There Was You is to show how intricately interwoven people's lives are without them even knowing it (echos of It's a Wonderful Life anyone?) This means backstory and "tangents." Everything from names to people, restaurants, TV shows, buildings--they all relate to each other. Thus, you can be intimately connected to someone without ever meeting them. Or, as this movie proves, you can be intimately connected and meet someone after MANY years and THEN realize how intimately connected you've been all along. In the case of Gwen and Nick, they know the same people, eat in the same restaurants, frequent the same buildings, etc. but they've never had a conversation and they don't know each other's names. That type of interaction is so intrinsically real that I personally can't help but be enchanted by the carefully constructed scenes. Of course, it can be difficult to piece everything together, which cuts down on the instant reward of an easy to follow storyline (that being another reason I believe critics didn't like it--it takes more than one viewing to really catch all of the details). But honestly, most of the greatest artistic works can't possibly be comprehended in one sitting (if you feel you can pull out every subtle fluctuation of every word in an Emily Dickinson poem by reading it once, you must have missed something...) If you invest enough time and attention in this film, THEN I think you'll see how wonderful it actually is. And, if not, you may at least appreciate the beautiful architecture of La Fortuna, Jennifer Aniston in a "Rachel" style role and the well-played characters Francesca (big applause to Sarah Jessica Parker) and Harriet (Alice Drummond).

    There's a nice build up for the first hour - two kids grow up and bump into each other several times before 'finding' each other - but then there seems to be twenty minutes of the end missing because one minute they don't know each other from Adam and then they're together. Somebody should explain that the only reason people go to see this type of movie is to WATCH THE CHARACTERS GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER. This movie completely skips this part and ruins all that's gone before it.

A major point of 'Til There Was You is to show how intricately interwoven people's lives are without them even knowing it (echos of It's a Wonderful Life anyone?) This means backstory and "tangents." Everything from names to people, restaurants, TV shows, buildings--they all relate to each other. Thus, you can be intimately connected to someone without ever meeting them. Or, as this movie proves, you can be intimately connected and meet someone after MANY years and THEN realize how intimately connected you've been all along. In the case of Gwen and Nick, they know the same people, eat in the same restaurants, frequent the same buildings, etc. but they've never had a conversation and they don't know each other's names. That type of interaction is so intrinsically real that I personally can't help but be enchanted by the carefully constructed scenes. Of course, it can be difficult to piece everything together, which cuts down on the instant reward of an easy to follow storyline (that being another reason I believe critics didn't like it--it takes more than one viewing to really catch all of the details). But honestly, most of the greatest artistic works can't possibly be comprehended in one sitting (if you feel you can pull out every subtle fluctuation of every word in an Emily Dickinson poem by reading it once, you must have missed something...) If you invest enough time and attention in this film, THEN I think you'll see how wonderful it actually is. And, if not, you may at least appreciate the beautiful architecture of La Fortuna, Jennifer Aniston in a "Rachel" style role and the well-played characters Francesca (big applause to Sarah Jessica Parker) and Harriet (Alice Drummond).

    There's a nice build up for the first hour - two kids grow up and bump into each other several times before 'finding' each other - but then there seems to be twenty minutes of the end missing because one minute they don't know each other from Adam and then they're together. Somebody should explain that the only reason people go to see this type of movie is to WATCH THE CHARACTERS GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER. This movie completely skips this part and ruins all that's gone before it.

    I saw this movie last night on DVD and was shocked to find it has such a low rating. We enjoyed it very much, it has an interesting story, is funny, and has a fine cast. It begins in the early 1960s and we see two key characters, a young boy and a young girl, in the same school and both destined to become musicians, but never really being friends. We somehow sense that there may be a future together for these two. Most of the movie is set in the current time, which was 1997. The characters are in their mid-30s and still struggling to find their destiny in life. One of those two young students grew up to be Jeanne Tripplehorn as Gwen Moss, a writer who loves to write poetry but makes her living ghost-writing for others. In that regard she gets hooked up with Sarah Jessica Parker as Francesca Lanfield who grew up on camera in a family TV show "One Big Happy Family". The other young student grew up to be Dylan McDermott as Nick, an architect with an unusual style. Although he got in a bit of hot water with his boss for going out on his own to design an unusual restaurant, when Francesca finds out he was the architect she insisted that he lead a new project that involved her. Jennifer Aniston, before she became famous, has a smaller part as Gwen's friend, Debbie. Good movie, we enjoyed it.

    I own a copy of this movie and loaned it out to various movie-loving coworkers, telling them nothing about it in advance and asking them to only to 'rate it on a scale of 1-10'. Sadly, of a group of 10 different viewers, it rated an average of '3'; most thought it was awful. Only one of the 10 recognized the brilliance of this title. The irony, the ongoing parallel construction, the 'pay attention to the details' element. I'm pretty sure this story will go on to be a sort of "It's a Wonderful Life" type of film; an initial box office disappointment that is rediscovered many years later. The running gag about cigarette smoking alone sets it apart from all other movies. It's a breath of fresh air in the formulaic approach of movie making. Quirky and odd as it may be, its message of 'love will find a way' (in spite of our disruption) registered a connection in me; "in the end it always works out; don't give up".

    Stories intertwine through our lives, around life events, past our passions, and a few stories themselves remind us of this. "'Til There Was You" makes this self-conscious storytelling into a delightful journey. Two journeys, in fact, because it takes the title literally. Two fascinating people (writer Jeanne Tripplehorn, architect Dylan McDermott) are shown growing up and constantly seeking passion and connection in their lives, but finding no way to hold on to either. When a bit of serendipity comes along, they both are transformed: An historic and almost otherworldly Los Angeles apartment house shows magic and belonging to her, substance and commitment to him. The ironies lie in her defending it in anonymous letters, his falling in love with the letters while designing the building's replacement, the building being owned by his lover, whose book is being ghostwritten by ... but you may get the idea. The writer and the architect are woven together by ties and resonances they cannot imagine, and yet they've never even (formally) met. It's a rich, intricate, hilarious, and wry screenplay, written by a principal writer of "thirtysomething" and writer/creator of "My So-Called Life." The acting is touching and passionate, especially when one realizes that it's two connecting love stories - about learning to love and respect yourself, before you can find the serendipities of life. This isn't a conventional romantic comedy or drama. The couple isn't what is important here. The individuals are. In "The Fountainhead," Ayn Rand wrote: "To say 'I love you,' one must know first how to say the 'I.'" These characters don't know, at first, but they're open to life, and they find out, playing with and against friends, neighbors, and lovers. Their journey is what will enthrall you. The ending almost doesn't matter. See this, on cable or disc, and give it your full attention. You will be rewarded!

    Gwen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) is a romantic dreamer, encouraged by her mother, but she is disappointed in love time and again. Nick (Dylan McDermott) grew up in a dysfunctional family and, consequently, wears no rose colored glasses to look upon life and romance. There is one common denominator between the two of them, they both loved a "Brady Bunch" type show called One Big Happy Family when they were young. The child star of the show, Francesca Lanfield (Sarah Jessica Parker), grew up to be a troubled adult, with drug problems, who now lives on investments that were made for her during her young acting days. Thus, she owns a beautiful old apartment building in Los Angeles, which once housed Louise Brooks, and where Gwen now resides, that she is selling for big bucks. The plan is to raze the building and erect something new. As luck would have it, Nick is the architect of the project and Francesca likes what she sees and the two start a sexually-charged thing. The "luck" continues when Gwen, an author, is assigned to ghost write Francesca's autobiography. Thus, the two of them have connections to Francesca, a happening to add to the string of chance meetings and near misses between Nick and Gwen throughout their lives. As Gwen fights for her beloved building, Nick has second thoughts about his role in its destruction and Francesca remains a petulant, mostly unlovable eccentric, how will the film play out? This is a sweet story with attractive, talented performers but its pace is so slow that some viewers may turn it off. Certainly, Tripplehorn, McDermott, and Parker give nice performances, especially Parker, who makes a believable, mixed-up child star all grown up. Then, too, the L.A. scenery, costumes, and amenities are fine indeed. But, the script, which contains many good ideas and themes, moves along very slowly and the direction is far from snappy as well. Therefore, if you love romantic dramas, especially those that sport beautiful actors, do make time for this one. It has a nice tale to tell, even as it takes what seems like a decade to tell it.

    I was channel surfing when I happened to catch this movie and, after it was over, it really got me to think about life - and how small things can change the way it turns out to be, and how inter-connected we all are. It was quite funny to watch Nick and Gwen always managing to miss each other. I think the acting could have been a bit better though - especially Jennifer Aniston not having a role at all was quite disappointing. However, this was the first movie in which I really loved Sarah Jessica Parker. She managed to do a whole range of emotions with seeming ease. I can't understand why it didn't do well at the box office. I hadn't seen it before, but have been recommending it to friends ever since. On the whole a really good movie.

    I caught this on TV last night(sans ad-breaks), and I have to say, I liked it a lot. I had tried to watch it a few times before on TV, but had never really got hooked into the story enough to stick with it until the end. I'm glad I did now. I hate Sex And The City, especially SJP's character in it, but she was great in this movie. And (gulp!) very sexy in it. Must have been the Bob. Jean Tripplehorn is very underrated, and has had some casting misfortunes in the past, which have overshadowed her talent and potential. Even though her character here was for the most part a little distant and icy, she still managed to bring a bit of warmth to the part. And she's also extremely attractive, which never hurts. Jen Aniston "didnt play Rachel", which was a good thing. The supporting cast did their jobs well, and Dylan McDermott? Well, you either like him or you loathe him, I have found. I thought he was quite watchable in this. I was amused to see reviewers on here, knocking the film because people smoked in it. Honestly, I don't understand what that has to do with a film's artistic merit. On matters like smoking and drug use, some of our members(non-UK, usually) tend to let their right wing views tarnish their opinions of a film. Which is, as they say on message boards, "Retarded". Take a chance and see this film. It's not Con Air, but it has a story, characters, and lots of smoking. (irony) Which is wrong, as Jesus doesn't like smoking. Or homosexuals(/irony). 7.5 out of 10, Goodnight.

    The comments here seem to indicate a preference for the movie not reflected in the overall rating of below 5. I think that's because the people who love the film are answering a perceived wrong, that critics/viewers want a typical romantic comedy storyline, that completely misses the point. The reason this film is not good is the basics: story details and acting. I actually think the major lead roles were miscast--too old to be college students, or even young professionals (it was hard to tell exactly how old they were supposed to be throughout the movie), and not entirely convincing in their performances. But then the story details were not all there. I liked the concept of the random connections the main characters shared, and didn't have a problem at all with the fact that they didn't meet until the end (although I agree with another reviewer in that I would have liked to have seen something more than just 1st meeting directly to 10+ years later with a child). But it was not very well executed, and details fell through the cracks. Many of the minor characters were so 2-dimensional. Jennifer Aniston's "best friend" character was hardly given a chance to develop. The saving grace of this film for me was Sarah Jessica Parker, who was able to cover a range of behaviors so believably in a character that had the potential for caricature.

    This may contain spoilers, depending on your definition of the word "spoiler" You've been warned. Being a rather large fan of Winnie Holzman's writing (and a fan of the work she and Scott Winant have done for the Bedford Falls Company), I may be slightly biased regarding this film, but I honestly feel that 'Til There Was You is highly underrated. The few reviews that I've seen site the film's major flaw as a lack of direct interaction between the two protagonists, Gwen and Nick. In my opinion, the authors of said reviews were obviously looking for a stereotypical romantic comedy storyline. That's not what this film offers. Instead, it takes a more realistic approach to the relationships between its main characters. An approach that is round-about and does not offer the quick rewards of a Nora Ephron insta-relationship (try You've Got Mail, if that's what you're looking for--typical romantic comedy but with panache). A major point of 'Til There Was You is to show how intricately interwoven people's lives are without them even knowing it (echos of It's a Wonderful Life anyone?) This means backstory and "tangents." Everything from names to people, restaurants, TV shows, buildings--they all relate to each other. Thus, you can be intimately connected to someone without ever meeting them.

Being a rather large fan of Winnie Holzman's writing (and a fan of the work she and Scott Winant have done for the Bedford Falls Company), I may be slightly biased regarding this film, but I honestly feel that 'Til There Was You is highly underrated. The few reviews that I've seen site the film's major flaw as a lack of direct interaction between the two protagonists, Gwen and Nick. In my opinion, the authors of said reviews were obviously looking for a stereotypical romantic comedy storyline. That's not what this film offers. Instead, it takes a more realistic approach to the relationships between its main characters. An approach that is round-about and does not offer the quick rewards of a Nora Ephron insta-relationship (try You've Got Mail, if that's what you're looking for--typical romantic comedy but with panache). A major point of 'Til There Was You is to show how intricately interwoven people's lives are without them even knowing it (echos of It's a Wonderful Life anyone?) This means backstory and "tangents." Everything from names to people, restaurants, TV shows, buildings--they all relate to each other. Thus, you can be intimately connected to someone without ever meeting them. Or, as this movie proves, you can be intimately connected and meet someone after MANY years and THEN realize how intimately connected you've been all along. In the case of Gwen and Nick, they know the same people, eat in the same restaurants, frequent the same buildings, etc. but they've never had a conversation and they don't know each other's names. That type of interaction is so intrinsically real that I personally can't help but be enchanted by the carefully constructed scenes. Of course, it can be difficult to piece everything together, which cuts down on the instant reward of an easy to follow storyline (that being another reason I believe critics didn't like it--it takes more than one viewing to really catch all of the details). But honestly, most of the greatest artistic works can't possibly be comprehended in one sitting (if you feel you can pull out every subtle fluctuation of every word in an Emily Dickinson poem by reading it once, you must have missed something...) If you invest enough time and attention in this film, THEN I think you'll see how wonderful it actually is. And, if not, you may at least appreciate the beautiful architecture of La Fortuna, Jennifer Aniston in a "Rachel" style role and the well-played characters Francesca (big applause to Sarah Jessica Parker) and Harriet (Alice Drummond).

    There's a nice build up for the first hour - two kids grow up and bump into each other several times before 'finding' each other - but then there seems to be twenty minutes of the end missing because one minute they don't know each other from Adam and then they're together. Somebody should explain that the only reason people go to see this type of movie is to WATCH THE CHARACTERS GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER. This movie completely skips this part and ruins all that's gone before it.

    I can't imagine anyone not liking this movie. It's a funny, sweet & romantic look at how people are. A sentimental look at how people live and meet. It's not a epic...but it was entertaining.
