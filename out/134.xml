  Following the death of a publishing tycoon, news reporters scramble to discover the meaning of his final utterance.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A group of reporters who are trying to decipher the last word ever spoke by Charles Foster Kane, the millionaire newspaper tycoon: "Rosebud." The film begins with a news reel detailing Kane's life for the masses, and then from there, we are shown flashbacks from Kane's life. As the reporters investigate further, the viewers see a display of a fascinating man's rise to fame, and how he eventually fell off the "top of the world."

    Citizen Kane laid, in 1941, the visual foundations of movies as we know them today, with groundbreaking shots, travellings and other matte paintings, as well as the flashback based non linear storytelling structure which has been used over and over since then, and this technical and innovative aspect is probably why this movie is considered by a lot of critics and institutions "the best of all time". Because if you think about the content, this is far from a masterpiece. The script is a long, disjointed and ultimately little interesting retrospective of Charles Kane life, where even the "Rosebud" plot turns out to be a letdown. If a remake, similar in every way, of Citizen Kane was made today, it would be considered average at best, which shows well that the historical context and the movie being some sort of pioneer influences the judgements a lot, at least more than the inherent quality of the film and its script in particular.

    I don't know if there is such a thing as a "perfect" movie, but this comes as close as anything I have ever seen. I recently re-watched Citizen Kane for the first time since high school. I don't know why it took me so long to watch it again, probably because the first time I saw it I was a little underwhelmed. I'll just chalk that up to immaturity though, this is most certainly one of the best films I've ever seen. Students of film history can tell you all about the innovative camera techniques and such that make this film very important. I prefer to just focus on the actual experience of watching it. First of all, every scene (and I truly do mean every scene) is absolutely visually stunning. You could pretty much take any individual frame and hang it in a gallery, it is that meticulously put together. Aside from that, it's just a great story. I don't usually find biopics about "great men" very compelling, as they have a tendency to elevate people to this almost god-like, larger-than-life status that causes me to just become disconnected and not care at all about the main character. Citizen Kane does precisely the opposite, it takes a "great man" in the eyes of society and brings him down to a human level. Ultimately Kane is just like everyone else, a man in search of lasting happiness that proves more elusive than it seems it should. If you haven't seen Citizen Kane, or even if it's been a long time, then go watch it as soon as possible. You certainly will not regret it.

    I watched this movie because it is declared "the greatest American Movie of all time blah blah blah". While not a bad movie, I can't agree it's a masterpiece in this day and age. I thought the intro was compelling, but the longer the movie drags on and as his life starts to go down hill so does the entertainment value. It simply wasn't very interesting for me to see this rich economical juggernaut have these problems. Oh boo hoo he wasn't able to become a governor... not a very easy goal to relate to... His problems to find true love were somewhat more personable but still just seemed like annoying ladies who weren't satisfied with his business oriented lifestyle. For it's time period I would surely rate it at least an 8. But now a days I found this to be good, but in no way great. It was some what depressing and did not really have a solid enough message or good enough plot/entertainment value to make up for it's somber conclusion. 6/10 it's still a decent flick but it's age was apparent and it is somewhat hard to relate to the character or sympathize with him which I feel is necessary to give this a higher rating. His problems were either too extreme to relate to or too common to base a movie off of...

    Through all movies this is the score which I give to this one. For its time he deserves more. But we are in other moment of the time/space continuum. Most probably every one of us had period in his life in which he wanted to be very rich. To be famous and known from everybody. To wealth and fame we can add the utopian idea this character to be noble, selflessness, robinhoodian. And what is the price for this when it really happen? This movie shows the life of Charles Kane, personification of the mentioned image above. He, from flash and bones, lived in the beginning of the previous century. Torn apart from his native home and his parents, the real things which he has are friendship and love. But they could not fill the opened wound. About this - what we want and what we receive, how much our life is our property and about the value of the material goods. This movie intrigue with setting an aim which is pursued till its end. Shown as stories of different characters, documentary restores the portrait of the protagonist and the main story.

    The motion picture that, since its inception, has been widely regarded by almost all critics, filmmakers, and even viewers around the world as the greatest of all time. And Citizen Kane, technically, might be the most influential film of all time but based solely on its plot aspect, there are better examples. Still, Citizen Kane is a boldly crafted film that not only defied all the typical methods of filmmaking that were in use at its time but invented some new ones during its making that later became the foundation on which modern filmmaking canvas stands tall. While there is a lot to take in in this film, the best part of Citizen Kane remains its stupefying cinematography & the structure of its narration while the worst was, in simple words & in just my opinion, a relatively boring story. So boring that it took me six unsuccessful attempts to finish it. But once it was finished, the end result was surprisingly much better than what I had expected. An unusual portrayal of a larger than life character told through different people and assisted by its carefully crafted screenplay, innovative sharp focus photography, non-linear narration, inventive use of make-up, sound & transition effects, score & a strong central performance by Orson Welles in front as well as behind the camera makes Citizen Kane, the most experimental cinema of its time and its significance is simply as mysterious as the symbolism behind the word, 'Rosebud'.

    'Citizen Kane', Written, Directed & Acted by the late Orson Welles, is something so magical & poetic, it defines Cinema. I Have NEVER seen a film as good as 'Citizen Kane' since 'The Shawshank Redemption'. 'Citizen Kane' Synopsis: Following the death of a publishing tycoon, news reporters scramble to discover the meaning of his final utterance. 'Citizen Kane' is about The Great American Dream. The Protagonist, Charles Foster Kane, is one of the few people who achieve greatness on Celluloid. He lives his dream, rises above the normal commoner & even sees through The Great Depression. The Protagonist defines ambition, greed & one-man-ship. Its a supremely well-written character, that also explores emotions & has his share of outbursts. Orson Welles is at his greatest high as far as creativity & imagination are concerned. He delivers a story so compelling & magnetic, it's hard not to be stunned by his work. His Screenplay is flawless & utterly amazing. Every Sequence, Every Character, is magnificently written. His Direction can be described as a Study. He handles this Epic Human Tale, astoundingly. And as far as his Performance goes as Charles Foster Kane, he's impeccable. His performance elevates Charles Foster Kane to perfection. On the whole, 'Citizen Kane' is Cinema At Its FINEST! A True Masterpiece!

    Just before Susan leaves, she tells Charles that he doesn't love her, he just wants her to love him. This is such a powerful statement, as it essentially sums up the way Charles Kane relates to everyone else. There is a scene where a drunk Jedediah confronts Kane in a similar fashion, chiding the way Charles puts himself on a pedestal when associating himself to other people. Charles is selfish, but almost as a defence mechanism. His parents, having sent him away as a young boy, left him to cope with a deep sense of abandonment. He seeks to fill that void with the admiration of others, but on his own terms. Instead of giving of himself, he wants people to love him in exchange for things or rights or privileges - in essence, he wants to purchase love and loyalty. He is not willing to offer love in return. If his own parents could abandon him, what is there to stop anyone else from doing the same? He falls for Susan one fateful night, because she enjoys him for who he is, unaware of his wealth and influence. Their relationship fizzles, however, as he constantly tries to buy her affection by forcing on her a childhood dream of hers to be a singer. His wealth and influence is great enough to make her a relative success, but her lack of talent, combined with critical derision, sours the dream. She wants out, but Charles forces the issue by building her opera houses across the country. All Susan wants is the fun, caring Charles she met that first night, not the man using his status to purchase her love. She feels no different than the many statues he has set up around their enormous, vacuous palace. Charles ends up driving Susan away because of his inability to love and his incessant need for control. It is the same control he imposes upon everyone else in his life, as a way to manage his own anxiety. He puts up walls to prevent anyone else from hurting him. When Susan leaves him, he comes across a snow globe in her room that reminds him of his childhood home - the last place he truly felt whole. "Rosebud," that final utterance, is the object to which he pins his last true sense of innocence - something he has been searching for ever since.

    I guess at this point most people know that Citizen Kane has been named as "the greatest film in History" by the American Film Institute. Such thing can make you develop really high expectations that won't be met. At least that's what happened to me. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but it isn't that "terrific" either. The story isn't very interesting and I couldn't find myself emphasizing with anyone, not even Charles Foster Kane. While I admit the dialogue was clever and the use of light give the movie an interesting, eerie atmosphere, the story is boring at many points, and its message has been heard a thousand times over. It may have been revolutionary for its time, but it feels rather outdated now. It's considered a classic movie but it didn't do much for me (and I do like classic movies). Don't get me wrong, all in all I believe it's a good movie, but it doesn't deserve the title it has been given. You either agree with it or you don't, with no inbetweens.

    It seems quite a few "Citizen Kane" fans now know, or believe they know, that the word 'rosebud' was a clever inside joke on the part of screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz (and Orson Welles), because apparently it was a nickname William Randolph Hearst used for his high-profile public mistress, the hot and juicy Marion Davies (the nickname being a rather descriptive term for a part of the female anatomy). And it's my understanding they'd have known this because Hearst referred to Ms. Davies by this nickname in front of others (and to what I'm sure must have been the embarrassment of some of their friends, who might also be gossipers). Who can say for sure whether this is true, but I believe it. Because it makes the story in "Citizen Kane" more coherent and focused, when you consider that it is largely about a great and influential man who throws away all the goods things he has, simply because he's middle-aged crazy for a young juicy blonde. It's right there in the movie's story, it's as obvious and as clear as daylight (or a bolt of lightning), but I'll admit it never seemed for me to be the central focus of the story, which was made vague in part by the clever and amusing dodge about a child's sled. And so now for me the central and key scene of the movie is where Kane has been confronted about his mistress by his wife (thanks to the hardball-playing Governor), he's caught in the "love nest" with the juicy young blonde... and what does he do, he throws everything away, a good and beautiful wife, a promising political career, and ultimately the respect and even friendship of his closest friend, all because he's middle-aged crazy and foolish for ROSEBUD. I believe this is what Mankiewicz (and Welles) meant as part, if not most, of their film's criticism and ridicule of the powerful and influential Hearst, who is obviously the inspiration and model for the fictional Charles Foster Kane... that ridicule again being of a great (and potentially greater) man reducing himself to being foolish and ridiculous, all for a piece of Marion Davies. I think another scene which now carries a different and more significant meaning, is the one in the screening room, where the producer of the newsreel charges the reporter with finding out what 'rosebud' means, saying "it'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing..." And then immediately a FLASH OF LIGHTNING, showing Susan Alexander's face. Anyway, no doubt about it, an amazing film to watch, containing many other insights too, such as a rather scathing (but true) critique of Hearst's manipulative use of the powerful capital of a newspaper (a use that ranges from at first exposing Wall Street corruption and fraud, to selfishly claiming election fraud in Kane's political defeat). And as far as the now more significant element of the story of a man throwing away all good things for a piece of ROSEBUD, even if you don't believe that's what the word means (according to the film's writer), and even if you don't think that's the focus of the story, it's still a real thing, many men, especially men of "money and property" (because of the greater independence and luxury it grants them), throw away everything at the onset of middle-age, in a mad and foolish and ridiculous pursuit of young juicy snatch. Two things though: one, I don't know if it ever has anything to do with the man's mother, or his childhood, or least of all any toys he had as a boy... and two, it usually doesn't result in a movie being made about the man (and his high-profile public mistress), let alone one that discerning film fans and critics consistently rate as perhaps the greatest ever made.

    There will always be debate on where this film ranks all-time. It is not my personal favorite film, but I think it is one of the greatest films ever made. Why? Orson Welles. He wrote, directed, and produced the film. Oh, and he starred in it. At the time, it was not as common to direct and star in a movie. Did I mention he was only 25 years old when he did this? Is it a perfect film? Hardly. But it's not far off, either. I do not know of a single film that can be honestly called "perfect." Start by looking at the Goofs page because that needs to be empty for a film to be truly perfect. For people who want action movies or comedies, they will find Citizen Kane boring. If you prefer deep characters and, honestly, older dramas, I doubt you would come away from this film thinking it was a waste of your time.

The story isn't very interesting and I couldn't find myself emphasizing with anyone, not even Charles Foster Kane. While I admit the dialogue was clever and the use of light give the movie an interesting, eerie atmosphere, the story is boring at many points, and its message has been heard a thousand times over. It may have been revolutionary for its time, but it feels rather outdated now. It's considered a classic movie but it didn't do much for me (and I do like classic movies). Don't get me wrong, all in all I believe it's a good movie, but it doesn't deserve the title it has been given. You either agree with it or you don't, with no inbetweens.

    It seems quite a few "Citizen Kane" fans now know, or believe they know, that the word 'rosebud' was a clever inside joke on the part of screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz (and Orson Welles), because apparently it was a nickname William Randolph Hearst used for his high-profile public mistress, the hot and juicy Marion Davies (the nickname being a rather descriptive term for a part of the female anatomy). And it's my understanding they'd have known this because Hearst referred to Ms. Davies by this nickname in front of others (and to what I'm sure must have been the embarrassment of some of their friends, who might also be gossipers). Who can say for sure whether this is true, but I believe it. Because it makes the story in "Citizen Kane" more coherent and focused, when you consider that it is largely about a great and influential man who throws away all the goods things he has, simply because he's middle-aged crazy for a young juicy blonde. It's right there in the movie's story, it's as obvious and as clear as daylight (or a bolt of lightning), but I'll admit it never seemed for me to be the central focus of the story, which was made vague in part by the clever and amusing dodge about a child's sled. And so now for me the central and key scene of the movie is where Kane has been confronted about his mistress by his wife (thanks to the hardball-playing Governor), he's caught in the "love nest" with the juicy young blonde... and what does he do, he throws everything away, a good and beautiful wife, a promising political career, and ultimately the respect and even friendship of his closest friend, all because he's middle-aged crazy and foolish for ROSEBUD. I believe this is what Mankiewicz (and Welles) meant as part, if not most, of their film's criticism and ridicule of the powerful and influential Hearst, who is obviously the inspiration and model for the fictional Charles Foster Kane... that ridicule again being of a great (and potentially greater) man reducing himself to being foolish and ridiculous, all for a piece of Marion Davies. I think another scene which now carries a different and more significant meaning, is the one in the screening room, where the producer of the newsreel charges the reporter with finding out what 'rosebud' means, saying "it'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing..." And then immediately a FLASH OF LIGHTNING, showing Susan Alexander's face. Anyway, no doubt about it, an amazing film to watch, containing many other insights too, such as a rather scathing (but true) critique of Hearst's manipulative use of the powerful capital of a newspaper (a use that ranges from at first exposing Wall Street corruption and fraud, to selfishly claiming election fraud in Kane's political defeat). And as far as the now more significant element of the story of a man throwing away all good things for a piece of ROSEBUD, even if you don't believe that's what the word means (according to the film's writer), and even if you don't think that's the focus of the story, it's still a real thing, many men, especially men of "money and property" (because of the greater independence and luxury it grants them), throw away everything at the onset of middle-age, in a mad and foolish and ridiculous pursuit of young juicy snatch. Two things though: one, I don't know if it ever has anything to do with the man's mother, or his childhood, or least of all any toys he had as a boy... and two, it usually doesn't result in a movie being made about the man (and his high-profile public mistress), let alone one that discerning film fans and critics consistently rate as perhaps the greatest ever made.

    There will always be debate on where this film ranks all-time. It is not my personal favorite film, but I think it is one of the greatest films ever made. Why? Orson Welles. He wrote, directed, and produced the film. Oh, and he starred in it. At the time, it was not as common to direct and star in a movie. Did I mention he was only 25 years old when he did this? Is it a perfect film? Hardly. But it's not far off, either. I do not know of a single film that can be honestly called "perfect." Start by looking at the Goofs page because that needs to be empty for a film to be truly perfect. For people who want action movies or comedies, they will find Citizen Kane boring. If you prefer deep characters and, honestly, older dramas, I doubt you would come away from this film thinking it was a waste of your time.

    Citizen Kane laid, in 1941, the visual foundations of movies as we know them today, with groundbreaking shots, travellings and other matte paintings, as well as the flashback based non linear storytelling structure which has been used over and over since then, and this technical and innovative aspect is probably why this movie is considered by a lot of critics and institutions "the best of all time". Because if you think about the content, this is far from a masterpiece. The script is a long, disjointed and ultimately little interesting retrospective of Charles Kane life, where even the "Rosebud" plot turns out to be a letdown. If a remake, similar in every way, of Citizen Kane was made today, it would be considered average at best, which shows well that the historical context and the movie being some sort of pioneer influences the judgements a lot, at least more than the inherent quality of the film and its script in particular.

    I don't know if there is such a thing as a "perfect" movie, but this comes as close as anything I have ever seen. I recently re-watched Citizen Kane for the first time since high school. I don't know why it took me so long to watch it again, probably because the first time I saw it I was a little underwhelmed. I'll just chalk that up to immaturity though, this is most certainly one of the best films I've ever seen. Students of film history can tell you all about the innovative camera techniques and such that make this film very important. I prefer to just focus on the actual experience of watching it. First of all, every scene (and I truly do mean every scene) is absolutely visually stunning. You could pretty much take any individual frame and hang it in a gallery, it is that meticulously put together. Aside from that, it's just a great story. I don't usually find biopics about "great men" very compelling, as they have a tendency to elevate people to this almost god-like, larger-than-life status that causes me to just become disconnected and not care at all about the main character. Citizen Kane does precisely the opposite, it takes a "great man" in the eyes of society and brings him down to a human level. Ultimately Kane is just like everyone else, a man in search of lasting happiness that proves more elusive than it seems it should. If you haven't seen Citizen Kane, or even if it's been a long time, then go watch it as soon as possible. You certainly will not regret it.

    I watched this movie because it is declared "the greatest American Movie of all time blah blah blah". While not a bad movie, I can't agree it's a masterpiece in this day and age. I thought the intro was compelling, but the longer the movie drags on and as his life starts to go down hill so does the entertainment value. It simply wasn't very interesting for me to see this rich economical juggernaut have these problems. Oh boo hoo he wasn't able to become a governor... not a very easy goal to relate to... His problems to find true love were somewhat more personable but still just seemed like annoying ladies who weren't satisfied with his business oriented lifestyle. For it's time period I would surely rate it at least an 8. But now a days I found this to be good, but in no way great. It was some what depressing and did not really have a solid enough message or good enough plot/entertainment value to make up for it's somber conclusion. 6/10 it's still a decent flick but it's age was apparent and it is somewhat hard to relate to the character or sympathize with him which I feel is necessary to give this a higher rating. His problems were either too extreme to relate to or too common to base a movie off of...

    Through all movies this is the score which I give to this one. For its time he deserves more. But we are in other moment of the time/space continuum. Most probably every one of us had period in his life in which he wanted to be very rich. To be famous and known from everybody. To wealth and fame we can add the utopian idea this character to be noble, selflessness, robinhoodian. And what is the price for this when it really happen? This movie shows the life of Charles Kane, personification of the mentioned image above. He, from flash and bones, lived in the beginning of the previous century. Torn apart from his native home and his parents, the real things which he has are friendship and love. But they could not fill the opened wound. About this - what we want and what we receive, how much our life is our property and about the value of the material goods. This movie intrigue with setting an aim which is pursued till its end. Shown as stories of different characters, documentary restores the portrait of the protagonist and the main story.

    The motion picture that, since its inception, has been widely regarded by almost all critics, filmmakers, and even viewers around the world as the greatest of all time. And Citizen Kane, technically, might be the most influential film of all time but based solely on its plot aspect, there are better examples. Still, Citizen Kane is a boldly crafted film that not only defied all the typical methods of filmmaking that were in use at its time but invented some new ones during its making that later became the foundation on which modern filmmaking canvas stands tall. While there is a lot to take in in this film, the best part of Citizen Kane remains its stupefying cinematography & the structure of its narration while the worst was, in simple words & in just my opinion, a relatively boring story. So boring that it took me six unsuccessful attempts to finish it. But once it was finished, the end result was surprisingly much better than what I had expected. An unusual portrayal of a larger than life character told through different people and assisted by its carefully crafted screenplay, innovative sharp focus photography, non-linear narration, inventive use of make-up, sound & transition effects, score & a strong central performance by Orson Welles in front as well as behind the camera makes Citizen Kane, the most experimental cinema of its time and its significance is simply as mysterious as the symbolism behind the word, 'Rosebud'.

    'Citizen Kane', Written, Directed & Acted by the late Orson Welles, is something so magical & poetic, it defines Cinema. I Have NEVER seen a film as good as 'Citizen Kane' since 'The Shawshank Redemption'. 'Citizen Kane' Synopsis: Following the death of a publishing tycoon, news reporters scramble to discover the meaning of his final utterance. 'Citizen Kane' is about The Great American Dream. The Protagonist, Charles Foster Kane, is one of the few people who achieve greatness on Celluloid. He lives his dream, rises above the normal commoner & even sees through The Great Depression. The Protagonist defines ambition, greed & one-man-ship. Its a supremely well-written character, that also explores emotions & has his share of outbursts. Orson Welles is at his greatest high as far as creativity & imagination are concerned. He delivers a story so compelling & magnetic, it's hard not to be stunned by his work. His Screenplay is flawless & utterly amazing. Every Sequence, Every Character, is magnificently written. His Direction can be described as a Study. He handles this Epic Human Tale, astoundingly. And as far as his Performance goes as Charles Foster Kane, he's impeccable. His performance elevates Charles Foster Kane to perfection. On the whole, 'Citizen Kane' is Cinema At Its FINEST! A True Masterpiece!

    Just before Susan leaves, she tells Charles that he doesn't love her, he just wants her to love him. This is such a powerful statement, as it essentially sums up the way Charles Kane relates to everyone else. There is a scene where a drunk Jedediah confronts Kane in a similar fashion, chiding the way Charles puts himself on a pedestal when associating himself to other people. Charles is selfish, but almost as a defence mechanism. His parents, having sent him away as a young boy, left him to cope with a deep sense of abandonment. He seeks to fill that void with the admiration of others, but on his own terms. Instead of giving of himself, he wants people to love him in exchange for things or rights or privileges - in essence, he wants to purchase love and loyalty. He is not willing to offer love in return. If his own parents could abandon him, what is there to stop anyone else from doing the same? He falls for Susan one fateful night, because she enjoys him for who he is, unaware of his wealth and influence. Their relationship fizzles, however, as he constantly tries to buy her affection by forcing on her a childhood dream of hers to be a singer. His wealth and influence is great enough to make her a relative success, but her lack of talent, combined with critical derision, sours the dream. She wants out, but Charles forces the issue by building her opera houses across the country. All Susan wants is the fun, caring Charles she met that first night, not the man using his status to purchase her love. She feels no different than the many statues he has set up around their enormous, vacuous palace. Charles ends up driving Susan away because of his inability to love and his incessant need for control. It is the same control he imposes upon everyone else in his life, as a way to manage his own anxiety. He puts up walls to prevent anyone else from hurting him. When Susan leaves him, he comes across a snow globe in her room that reminds him of his childhood home - the last place he truly felt whole. "Rosebud," that final utterance, is the object to which he pins his last true sense of innocence - something he has been searching for ever since.

    Just before Susan leaves, she tells Charles that he doesn't love her, he just wants her to love him. This is such a powerful statement, as it essentially sums up the way Charles Kane relates to everyone else. There is a scene where a drunk Jedediah confronts Kane in a similar fashion, chiding the way Charles puts himself on a pedestal when associating himself to other people. Charles is selfish, but almost as a defence mechanism. His parents, having sent him away as a young boy, left him to cope with a deep sense of abandonment. He seeks to fill that void with the admiration of others, but on his own terms. Instead of giving of himself, he wants people to love him in exchange for things or rights or privileges - in essence, he wants to purchase love and loyalty. He is not willing to offer love in return. If his own parents could abandon him, what is there to stop anyone else from doing the same? He falls for Susan one fateful night, because she enjoys him for who he is, unaware of his wealth and influence. Their relationship fizzles, however, as he constantly tries to buy her affection by forcing on her a childhood dream of hers to be a singer. His wealth and influence is great enough to make her a relative success, but her lack of talent, combined with critical derision, sours the dream. She wants out, but Charles forces the issue by building her opera houses across the country. All Susan wants is the fun, caring Charles she met that first night, not the man using his status to purchase her love. She feels no different than the many statues he has set up around their enormous, vacuous palace. Charles ends up driving Susan away because of his inability to love and his incessant need for control. It is the same control he imposes upon everyone else in his life, as a way to manage his own anxiety. He puts up walls to prevent anyone else from hurting him. When Susan leaves him, he comes across a snow globe in her room that reminds him of his childhood home - the last place he truly felt whole. "Rosebud," that final utterance, is the object to which he pins his last true sense of innocence - something he has been searching for ever since.

    I guess at this point most people know that Citizen Kane has been named as "the greatest film in History" by the American Film Institute. Such thing can make you develop really high expectations that won't be met. At least that's what happened to me. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but it isn't that "terrific" either. The story isn't very interesting and I couldn't find myself emphasizing with anyone, not even Charles Foster Kane. While I admit the dialogue was clever and the use of light give the movie an interesting, eerie atmosphere, the story is boring at many points, and its message has been heard a thousand times over. It may have been revolutionary for its time, but it feels rather outdated now. It's considered a classic movie but it didn't do much for me (and I do like classic movies). Don't get me wrong, all in all I believe it's a good movie, but it doesn't deserve the title it has been given. You either agree with it or you don't, with no inbetweens.

    It seems quite a few "Citizen Kane" fans now know, or believe they know, that the word 'rosebud' was a clever inside joke on the part of screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz (and Orson Welles), because apparently it was a nickname William Randolph Hearst used for his high-profile public mistress, the hot and juicy Marion Davies (the nickname being a rather descriptive term for a part of the female anatomy). And it's my understanding they'd have known this because Hearst referred to Ms. Davies by this nickname in front of others (and to what I'm sure must have been the embarrassment of some of their friends, who might also be gossipers). Who can say for sure whether this is true, but I believe it. Because it makes the story in "Citizen Kane" more coherent and focused, when you consider that it is largely about a great and influential man who throws away all the goods things he has, simply because he's middle-aged crazy for a young juicy blonde. It's right there in the movie's story, it's as obvious and as clear as daylight (or a bolt of lightning), but I'll admit it never seemed for me to be the central focus of the story, which was made vague in part by the clever and amusing dodge about a child's sled. And so now for me the central and key scene of the movie is where Kane has been confronted about his mistress by his wife (thanks to the hardball-playing Governor), he's caught in the "love nest" with the juicy young blonde... and what does he do, he throws everything away, a good and beautiful wife, a promising political career, and ultimately the respect and even friendship of his closest friend, all because he's middle-aged crazy and foolish for ROSEBUD. I believe this is what Mankiewicz (and Welles) meant as part, if not most, of their film's criticism and ridicule of the powerful and influential Hearst, who is obviously the inspiration and model for the fictional Charles Foster Kane... that ridicule again being of a great (and potentially greater) man reducing himself to being foolish and ridiculous, all for a piece of Marion Davies. I think another scene which now carries a different and more significant meaning, is the one in the screening room, where the producer of the newsreel charges the reporter with finding out what 'rosebud' means, saying "it'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing..." And then immediately a FLASH OF LIGHTNING, showing Susan Alexander's face. Anyway, no doubt about it, an amazing film to watch, containing many other insights too, such as a rather scathing (but true) critique of Hearst's manipulative use of the powerful capital of a newspaper (a use that ranges from at first exposing Wall Street corruption and fraud, to selfishly claiming election fraud in Kane's political defeat). And as far as the now more significant element of the story of a man throwing away all good things for a piece of ROSEBUD, even if you don't believe that's what the word means (according to the film's writer), and even if you don't think that's the focus of the story, it's still a real thing, many men, especially men of "money and property" (because of the greater independence and luxury it grants them), throw away everything at the onset of middle-age, in a mad and foolish and ridiculous pursuit of young juicy snatch. Two things though: one, I don't know if it ever has anything to do with the man's mother, or his childhood, or least of all any toys he had as a boy... and two, it usually doesn't result in a movie being made about the man (and his high-profile public mistress), let alone one that discerning film fans and critics consistently rate as perhaps the greatest ever made.

    There will always be debate on where this film ranks all-time. It is not my personal favorite film, but I think it is one of the greatest films ever made. Why? Orson Welles. He wrote, directed, and produced the film. Oh, and he starred in it. At the time, it was not as common to direct and star in a movie. Did I mention he was only 25 years old when he did this? Is it a perfect film? Hardly. But it's not far off, either. I do not know of a single film that can be honestly called "perfect." Start by looking at the Goofs page because that needs to be empty for a film to be truly perfect. For people who want action movies or comedies, they will find Citizen Kane boring. If you prefer deep characters and, honestly, older dramas, I doubt you would come away from this film thinking it was a waste of your time.

    Citizen Kane laid, in 1941, the visual foundations of movies as we know them today, with groundbreaking shots, travellings and other matte paintings, as well as the flashback based non linear storytelling structure which has been used over and over since then, and this technical and innovative aspect is probably why this movie is considered by a lot of critics and institutions "the best of all time". Because if you think about the content, this is far from a masterpiece. The script is a long, disjointed and ultimately little interesting retrospective of Charles Kane life, where even the "Rosebud" plot turns out to be a letdown. If a remake, similar in every way, of Citizen Kane was made today, it would be considered average at best, which shows well that the historical context and the movie being some sort of pioneer influences the judgements a lot, at least more than the inherent quality of the film and its script in particular.

    I don't know if there is such a thing as a "perfect" movie, but this comes as close as anything I have ever seen. I recently re-watched Citizen Kane for the first time since high school. I don't know why it took me so long to watch it again, probably because the first time I saw it I was a little underwhelmed. I'll just chalk that up to immaturity though, this is most certainly one of the best films I've ever seen. Students of film history can tell you all about the innovative camera techniques and such that make this film very important. I prefer to just focus on the actual experience of watching it. First of all, every scene (and I truly do mean every scene) is absolutely visually stunning. You could pretty much take any individual frame and hang it in a gallery, it is that meticulously put together. Aside from that, it's just a great story. I don't usually find biopics about "great men" very compelling, as they have a tendency to elevate people to this almost god-like, larger-than-life status that causes me to just become disconnected and not care at all about the main character. Citizen Kane does precisely the opposite, it takes a "great man" in the eyes of society and brings him down to a human level. Ultimately Kane is just like everyone else, a man in search of lasting happiness that proves more elusive than it seems it should. If you haven't seen Citizen Kane, or even if it's been a long time, then go watch it as soon as possible. You certainly will not regret it.

    I watched this movie because it is declared "the greatest American Movie of all time blah blah blah". While not a bad movie, I can't agree it's a masterpiece in this day and age. I thought the intro was compelling, but the longer the movie drags on and as his life starts to go down hill so does the entertainment value. It simply wasn't very interesting for me to see this rich economical juggernaut have these problems. Oh boo hoo he wasn't able to become a governor... not a very easy goal to relate to... His problems to find true love were somewhat more personable but still just seemed like annoying ladies who weren't satisfied with his business oriented lifestyle. For it's time period I would surely rate it at least an 8. But now a days I found this to be good, but in no way great. It was some what depressing and did not really have a solid enough message or good enough plot/entertainment value to make up for it's somber conclusion. 6/10 it's still a decent flick but it's age was apparent and it is somewhat hard to relate to the character or sympathize with him which I feel is necessary to give this a higher rating. His problems were either too extreme to relate to or too common to base a movie off of...

    Through all movies this is the score which I give to this one. For its time he deserves more. But we are in other moment of the time/space continuum. Most probably every one of us had period in his life in which he wanted to be very rich. To be famous and known from everybody. To wealth and fame we can add the utopian idea this character to be noble, selflessness, robinhoodian. And what is the price for this when it really happen? This movie shows the life of Charles Kane, personification of the mentioned image above. He, from flash and bones, lived in the beginning of the previous century. Torn apart from his native home and his parents, the real things which he has are friendship and love. But they could not fill the opened wound. About this - what we want and what we receive, how much our life is our property and about the value of the material goods. This movie intrigue with setting an aim which is pursued till its end. Shown as stories of different characters, documentary restores the portrait of the protagonist and the main story.

    The motion picture that, since its inception, has been widely regarded by almost all critics, filmmakers, and even viewers around the world as the greatest of all time. And Citizen Kane, technically, might be the most influential film of all time but based solely on its plot aspect, there are better examples. Still, Citizen Kane is a boldly crafted film that not only defied all the typical methods of filmmaking that were in use at its time but invented some new ones during its making that later became the foundation on which modern filmmaking canvas stands tall. While there is a lot to take in in this film, the best part of Citizen Kane remains its stupefying cinematography & the structure of its narration while the worst was, in simple words & in just my opinion, a relatively boring story. So boring that it took me six unsuccessful attempts to finish it. But once it was finished, the end result was surprisingly much better than what I had expected. An unusual portrayal of a larger than life character told through different people and assisted by its carefully crafted screenplay, innovative sharp focus photography, non-linear narration, inventive use of make-up, sound & transition effects, score & a strong central performance by Orson Welles in front as well as behind the camera makes Citizen Kane, the most experimental cinema of its time and its significance is simply as mysterious as the symbolism behind the word, 'Rosebud'.

    'Citizen Kane', Written, Directed & Acted by the late Orson Welles, is something so magical & poetic, it defines Cinema. I Have NEVER seen a film as good as 'Citizen Kane' since 'The Shawshank Redemption'. 'Citizen Kane' Synopsis: Following the death of a publishing tycoon, news reporters scramble to discover the meaning of his final utterance. 'Citizen Kane' is about The Great American Dream. The Protagonist, Charles Foster Kane, is one of the few people who achieve greatness on Celluloid. He lives his dream, rises above the normal commoner & even sees through The Great Depression. The Protagonist defines ambition, greed & one-man-ship. Its a supremely well-written character, that also explores emotions & has his share of outbursts. Orson Welles is at his greatest high as far as creativity & imagination are concerned. He delivers a story so compelling & magnetic, it's hard not to be stunned by his work. His Screenplay is flawless & utterly amazing. Every Sequence, Every Character, is magnificently written. His Direction can be described as a Study. He handles this Epic Human Tale, astoundingly. And as far as his Performance goes as Charles Foster Kane, he's impeccable. His performance elevates Charles Foster Kane to perfection. On the whole, 'Citizen Kane' is Cinema At Its FINEST! A True Masterpiece!

    Through all movies this is the score which I give to this one. For its time he deserves more. But we are in other moment of the time/space continuum. Most probably every one of us had period in his life in which he wanted to be very rich. To be famous and known from everybody. To wealth and fame we can add the utopian idea this character to be noble, selflessness, robinhoodian. And what is the price for this when it really happen? This movie shows the life of Charles Kane, personification of the mentioned image above. He, from flash and bones, lived in the beginning of the previous century. Torn apart from his native home and his parents, the real things which he has are friendship and love. But they could not fill the opened wound. About this - what we want and what we receive, how much our life is our property and about the value of the material goods. This movie intrigue with setting an aim which is pursued till its end. Shown as stories of different characters, documentary restores the portrait of the protagonist and the main story.

    The motion picture that, since its inception, has been widely regarded by almost all critics, filmmakers, and even viewers around the world as the greatest of all time. And Citizen Kane, technically, might be the most influential film of all time but based solely on its plot aspect, there are better examples. Still, Citizen Kane is a boldly crafted film that not only defied all the typical methods of filmmaking that were in use at its time but invented some new ones during its making that later became the foundation on which modern filmmaking canvas stands tall. While there is a lot to take in in this film, the best part of Citizen Kane remains its stupefying cinematography & the structure of its narration while the worst was, in simple words & in just my opinion, a relatively boring story. So boring that it took me six unsuccessful attempts to finish it. But once it was finished, the end result was surprisingly much better than what I had expected. An unusual portrayal of a larger than life character told through different people and assisted by its carefully crafted screenplay, innovative sharp focus photography, non-linear narration, inventive use of make-up, sound & transition effects, score & a strong central performance by Orson Welles in front as well as behind the camera makes Citizen Kane, the most experimental cinema of its time and its significance is simply as mysterious as the symbolism behind the word, 'Rosebud'.

    'Citizen Kane', Written, Directed & Acted by the late Orson Welles, is something so magical & poetic, it defines Cinema. I Have NEVER seen a film as good as 'Citizen Kane' since 'The Shawshank Redemption'. 'Citizen Kane' Synopsis: Following the death of a publishing tycoon, news reporters scramble to discover the meaning of his final utterance. 'Citizen Kane' is about The Great American Dream. The Protagonist, Charles Foster Kane, is one of the few people who achieve greatness on Celluloid. He lives his dream, rises above the normal commoner & even sees through The Great Depression. The Protagonist defines ambition, greed & one-man-ship. Its a supremely well-written character, that also explores emotions & has his share of outbursts. Orson Welles is at his greatest high as far as creativity & imagination are concerned. He delivers a story so compelling & magnetic, it's hard not to be stunned by his work. His Screenplay is flawless & utterly amazing. Every Sequence, Every Character, is magnificently written. His Direction can be described as a Study. He handles this Epic Human Tale, astoundingly. And as far as his Performance goes as Charles Foster Kane, he's impeccable. His performance elevates Charles Foster Kane to perfection. On the whole, 'Citizen Kane' is Cinema At Its FINEST! A True Masterpiece!

    Just before Susan leaves, she tells Charles that he doesn't love her, he just wants her to love him. This is such a powerful statement, as it essentially sums up the way Charles Kane relates to everyone else. There is a scene where a drunk Jedediah confronts Kane in a similar fashion, chiding the way Charles puts himself on a pedestal when associating himself to other people. Charles is selfish, but almost as a defence mechanism. His parents, having sent him away as a young boy, left him to cope with a deep sense of abandonment. He seeks to fill that void with the admiration of others, but on his own terms. Instead of giving of himself, he wants people to love him in exchange for things or rights or privileges - in essence, he wants to purchase love and loyalty. He is not willing to offer love in return. If his own parents could abandon him, what is there to stop anyone else from doing the same? He falls for Susan one fateful night, because she enjoys him for who he is, unaware of his wealth and influence. Their relationship fizzles, however, as he constantly tries to buy her affection by forcing on her a childhood dream of hers to be a singer. His wealth and influence is great enough to make her a relative success, but her lack of talent, combined with critical derision, sours the dream. She wants out, but Charles forces the issue by building her opera houses across the country. All Susan wants is the fun, caring Charles she met that first night, not the man using his status to purchase her love. She feels no different than the many statues he has set up around their enormous, vacuous palace. Charles ends up driving Susan away because of his inability to love and his incessant need for control. It is the same control he imposes upon everyone else in his life, as a way to manage his own anxiety. He puts up walls to prevent anyone else from hurting him. When Susan leaves him, he comes across a snow globe in her room that reminds him of his childhood home - the last place he truly felt whole. "Rosebud," that final utterance, is the object to which he pins his last true sense of innocence - something he has been searching for ever since.

    I guess at this point most people know that Citizen Kane has been named as "the greatest film in History" by the American Film Institute. Such thing can make you develop really high expectations that won't be met. At least that's what happened to me. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but it isn't that "terrific" either. The story isn't very interesting and I couldn't find myself emphasizing with anyone, not even Charles Foster Kane. While I admit the dialogue was clever and the use of light give the movie an interesting, eerie atmosphere, the story is boring at many points, and its message has been heard a thousand times over. It may have been revolutionary for its time, but it feels rather outdated now. It's considered a classic movie but it didn't do much for me (and I do like classic movies). Don't get me wrong, all in all I believe it's a good movie, but it doesn't deserve the title it has been given. You either agree with it or you don't, with no inbetweens.

    It seems quite a few "Citizen Kane" fans now know, or believe they know, that the word 'rosebud' was a clever inside joke on the part of screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz (and Orson Welles), because apparently it was a nickname William Randolph Hearst used for his high-profile public mistress, the hot and juicy Marion Davies (the nickname being a rather descriptive term for a part of the female anatomy). And it's my understanding they'd have known this because Hearst referred to Ms. Davies by this nickname in front of others (and to what I'm sure must have been the embarrassment of some of their friends, who might also be gossipers). Who can say for sure whether this is true, but I believe it. Because it makes the story in "Citizen Kane" more coherent and focused, when you consider that it is largely about a great and influential man who throws away all the goods things he has, simply because he's middle-aged crazy for a young juicy blonde. It's right there in the movie's story, it's as obvious and as clear as daylight (or a bolt of lightning), but I'll admit it never seemed for me to be the central focus of the story, which was made vague in part by the clever and amusing dodge about a child's sled. And so now for me the central and key scene of the movie is where Kane has been confronted about his mistress by his wife (thanks to the hardball-playing Governor), he's caught in the "love nest" with the juicy young blonde... and what does he do, he throws everything away, a good and beautiful wife, a promising political career, and ultimately the respect and even friendship of his closest friend, all because he's middle-aged crazy and foolish for ROSEBUD. I believe this is what Mankiewicz (and Welles) meant as part, if not most, of their film's criticism and ridicule of the powerful and influential Hearst, who is obviously the inspiration and model for the fictional Charles Foster Kane... that ridicule again being of a great (and potentially greater) man reducing himself to being foolish and ridiculous, all for a piece of Marion Davies. I think another scene which now carries a different and more significant meaning, is the one in the screening room, where the producer of the newsreel charges the reporter with finding out what 'rosebud' means, saying "it'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing..." And then immediately a FLASH OF LIGHTNING, showing Susan Alexander's face. Anyway, no doubt about it, an amazing film to watch, containing many other insights too, such as a rather scathing (but true) critique of Hearst's manipulative use of the powerful capital of a newspaper (a use that ranges from at first exposing Wall Street corruption and fraud, to selfishly claiming election fraud in Kane's political defeat). And as far as the now more significant element of the story of a man throwing away all good things for a piece of ROSEBUD, even if you don't believe that's what the word means (according to the film's writer), and even if you don't think that's the focus of the story, it's still a real thing, many men, especially men of "money and property" (because of the greater independence and luxury it grants them), throw away everything at the onset of middle-age, in a mad and foolish and ridiculous pursuit of young juicy snatch. Two things though: one, I don't know if it ever has anything to do with the man's mother, or his childhood, or least of all any toys he had as a boy... and two, it usually doesn't result in a movie being made about the man (and his high-profile public mistress), let alone one that discerning film fans and critics consistently rate as perhaps the greatest ever made.

    There will always be debate on where this film ranks all-time. It is not my personal favorite film, but I think it is one of the greatest films ever made. Why? Orson Welles. He wrote, directed, and produced the film. Oh, and he starred in it. At the time, it was not as common to direct and star in a movie. Did I mention he was only 25 years old when he did this? Is it a perfect film? Hardly. But it's not far off, either. I do not know of a single film that can be honestly called "perfect." Start by looking at the Goofs page because that needs to be empty for a film to be truly perfect. For people who want action movies or comedies, they will find Citizen Kane boring. If you prefer deep characters and, honestly, older dramas, I doubt you would come away from this film thinking it was a waste of your time.

    Citizen Kane laid, in 1941, the visual foundations of movies as we know them today, with groundbreaking shots, travellings and other matte paintings, as well as the flashback based non linear storytelling structure which has been used over and over since then, and this technical and innovative aspect is probably why this movie is considered by a lot of critics and institutions "the best of all time". Because if you think about the content, this is far from a masterpiece. The script is a long, disjointed and ultimately little interesting retrospective of Charles Kane life, where even the "Rosebud" plot turns out to be a letdown. If a remake, similar in every way, of Citizen Kane was made today, it would be considered average at best, which shows well that the historical context and the movie being some sort of pioneer influences the judgements a lot, at least more than the inherent quality of the film and its script in particular.

    I don't know if there is such a thing as a "perfect" movie, but this comes as close as anything I have ever seen. I recently re-watched Citizen Kane for the first time since high school. I don't know why it took me so long to watch it again, probably because the first time I saw it I was a little underwhelmed. I'll just chalk that up to immaturity though, this is most certainly one of the best films I've ever seen. Students of film history can tell you all about the innovative camera techniques and such that make this film very important. I prefer to just focus on the actual experience of watching it. First of all, every scene (and I truly do mean every scene) is absolutely visually stunning. You could pretty much take any individual frame and hang it in a gallery, it is that meticulously put together. Aside from that, it's just a great story. I don't usually find biopics about "great men" very compelling, as they have a tendency to elevate people to this almost god-like, larger-than-life status that causes me to just become disconnected and not care at all about the main character. Citizen Kane does precisely the opposite, it takes a "great man" in the eyes of society and brings him down to a human level. Ultimately Kane is just like everyone else, a man in search of lasting happiness that proves more elusive than it seems it should. If you haven't seen Citizen Kane, or even if it's been a long time, then go watch it as soon as possible. You certainly will not regret it.

    I watched this movie because it is declared "the greatest American Movie of all time blah blah blah". While not a bad movie, I can't agree it's a masterpiece in this day and age. I thought the intro was compelling, but the longer the movie drags on and as his life starts to go down hill so does the entertainment value. It simply wasn't very interesting for me to see this rich economical juggernaut have these problems. Oh boo hoo he wasn't able to become a governor... not a very easy goal to relate to... His problems to find true love were somewhat more personable but still just seemed like annoying ladies who weren't satisfied with his business oriented lifestyle. For it's time period I would surely rate it at least an 8. But now a days I found this to be good, but in no way great. It was some what depressing and did not really have a solid enough message or good enough plot/entertainment value to make up for it's somber conclusion. 6/10 it's still a decent flick but it's age was apparent and it is somewhat hard to relate to the character or sympathize with him which I feel is necessary to give this a higher rating. His problems were either too extreme to relate to or too common to base a movie off of...

    I don't know if there is such a thing as a "perfect" movie, but this comes as close as anything I have ever seen. I recently re-watched Citizen Kane for the first time since high school. I don't know why it took me so long to watch it again, probably because the first time I saw it I was a little underwhelmed. I'll just chalk that up to immaturity though, this is most certainly one of the best films I've ever seen. Students of film history can tell you all about the innovative camera techniques and such that make this film very important. I prefer to just focus on the actual experience of watching it. First of all, every scene (and I truly do mean every scene) is absolutely visually stunning. You could pretty much take any individual frame and hang it in a gallery, it is that meticulously put together. Aside from that, it's just a great story. I don't usually find biopics about "great men" very compelling, as they have a tendency to elevate people to this almost god-like, larger-than-life status that causes me to just become disconnected and not care at all about the main character. Citizen Kane does precisely the opposite, it takes a "great man" in the eyes of society and brings him down to a human level. Ultimately Kane is just like everyone else, a man in search of lasting happiness that proves more elusive than it seems it should. If you haven't seen Citizen Kane, or even if it's been a long time, then go watch it as soon as possible. You certainly will not regret it.

    I watched this movie because it is declared "the greatest American Movie of all time blah blah blah". While not a bad movie, I can't agree it's a masterpiece in this day and age. I thought the intro was compelling, but the longer the movie drags on and as his life starts to go down hill so does the entertainment value. It simply wasn't very interesting for me to see this rich economical juggernaut have these problems. Oh boo hoo he wasn't able to become a governor... not a very easy goal to relate to... His problems to find true love were somewhat more personable but still just seemed like annoying ladies who weren't satisfied with his business oriented lifestyle. For it's time period I would surely rate it at least an 8. But now a days I found this to be good, but in no way great. It was some what depressing and did not really have a solid enough message or good enough plot/entertainment value to make up for it's somber conclusion. 6/10 it's still a decent flick but it's age was apparent and it is somewhat hard to relate to the character or sympathize with him which I feel is necessary to give this a higher rating. His problems were either too extreme to relate to or too common to base a movie off of...

    Through all movies this is the score which I give to this one. For its time he deserves more. But we are in other moment of the time/space continuum. Most probably every one of us had period in his life in which he wanted to be very rich. To be famous and known from everybody. To wealth and fame we can add the utopian idea this character to be noble, selflessness, robinhoodian. And what is the price for this when it really happen? This movie shows the life of Charles Kane, personification of the mentioned image above. He, from flash and bones, lived in the beginning of the previous century. Torn apart from his native home and his parents, the real things which he has are friendship and love. But they could not fill the opened wound. About this - what we want and what we receive, how much our life is our property and about the value of the material goods. This movie intrigue with setting an aim which is pursued till its end. Shown as stories of different characters, documentary restores the portrait of the protagonist and the main story.

    The motion picture that, since its inception, has been widely regarded by almost all critics, filmmakers, and even viewers around the world as the greatest of all time. And Citizen Kane, technically, might be the most influential film of all time but based solely on its plot aspect, there are better examples. Still, Citizen Kane is a boldly crafted film that not only defied all the typical methods of filmmaking that were in use at its time but invented some new ones during its making that later became the foundation on which modern filmmaking canvas stands tall. While there is a lot to take in in this film, the best part of Citizen Kane remains its stupefying cinematography & the structure of its narration while the worst was, in simple words & in just my opinion, a relatively boring story. So boring that it took me six unsuccessful attempts to finish it. But once it was finished, the end result was surprisingly much better than what I had expected. An unusual portrayal of a larger than life character told through different people and assisted by its carefully crafted screenplay, innovative sharp focus photography, non-linear narration, inventive use of make-up, sound & transition effects, score & a strong central performance by Orson Welles in front as well as behind the camera makes Citizen Kane, the most experimental cinema of its time and its significance is simply as mysterious as the symbolism behind the word, 'Rosebud'.

    'Citizen Kane', Written, Directed & Acted by the late Orson Welles, is something so magical & poetic, it defines Cinema. I Have NEVER seen a film as good as 'Citizen Kane' since 'The Shawshank Redemption'. 'Citizen Kane' Synopsis: Following the death of a publishing tycoon, news reporters scramble to discover the meaning of his final utterance. 'Citizen Kane' is about The Great American Dream. The Protagonist, Charles Foster Kane, is one of the few people who achieve greatness on Celluloid. He lives his dream, rises above the normal commoner & even sees through The Great Depression. The Protagonist defines ambition, greed & one-man-ship. Its a supremely well-written character, that also explores emotions & has his share of outbursts. Orson Welles is at his greatest high as far as creativity & imagination are concerned. He delivers a story so compelling & magnetic, it's hard not to be stunned by his work. His Screenplay is flawless & utterly amazing. Every Sequence, Every Character, is magnificently written. His Direction can be described as a Study. He handles this Epic Human Tale, astoundingly. And as far as his Performance goes as Charles Foster Kane, he's impeccable. His performance elevates Charles Foster Kane to perfection. On the whole, 'Citizen Kane' is Cinema At Its FINEST! A True Masterpiece!

    Just before Susan leaves, she tells Charles that he doesn't love her, he just wants her to love him. This is such a powerful statement, as it essentially sums up the way Charles Kane relates to everyone else. There is a scene where a drunk Jedediah confronts Kane in a similar fashion, chiding the way Charles puts himself on a pedestal when associating himself to other people. Charles is selfish, but almost as a defence mechanism. His parents, having sent him away as a young boy, left him to cope with a deep sense of abandonment. He seeks to fill that void with the admiration of others, but on his own terms. Instead of giving of himself, he wants people to love him in exchange for things or rights or privileges - in essence, he wants to purchase love and loyalty. He is not willing to offer love in return. If his own parents could abandon him, what is there to stop anyone else from doing the same? He falls for Susan one fateful night, because she enjoys him for who he is, unaware of his wealth and influence. Their relationship fizzles, however, as he constantly tries to buy her affection by forcing on her a childhood dream of hers to be a singer. His wealth and influence is great enough to make her a relative success, but her lack of talent, combined with critical derision, sours the dream. She wants out, but Charles forces the issue by building her opera houses across the country. All Susan wants is the fun, caring Charles she met that first night, not the man using his status to purchase her love. She feels no different than the many statues he has set up around their enormous, vacuous palace. Charles ends up driving Susan away because of his inability to love and his incessant need for control. It is the same control he imposes upon everyone else in his life, as a way to manage his own anxiety. He puts up walls to prevent anyone else from hurting him. When Susan leaves him, he comes across a snow globe in her room that reminds him of his childhood home - the last place he truly felt whole. "Rosebud," that final utterance, is the object to which he pins his last true sense of innocence - something he has been searching for ever since.

    I guess at this point most people know that Citizen Kane has been named as "the greatest film in History" by the American Film Institute. Such thing can make you develop really high expectations that won't be met. At least that's what happened to me. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but it isn't that "terrific" either. The story isn't very interesting and I couldn't find myself emphasizing with anyone, not even Charles Foster Kane. While I admit the dialogue was clever and the use of light give the movie an interesting, eerie atmosphere, the story is boring at many points, and its message has been heard a thousand times over. It may have been revolutionary for its time, but it feels rather outdated now. It's considered a classic movie but it didn't do much for me (and I do like classic movies). Don't get me wrong, all in all I believe it's a good movie, but it doesn't deserve the title it has been given. You either agree with it or you don't, with no inbetweens.

    It seems quite a few "Citizen Kane" fans now know, or believe they know, that the word 'rosebud' was a clever inside joke on the part of screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz (and Orson Welles), because apparently it was a nickname William Randolph Hearst used for his high-profile public mistress, the hot and juicy Marion Davies (the nickname being a rather descriptive term for a part of the female anatomy). And it's my understanding they'd have known this because Hearst referred to Ms. Davies by this nickname in front of others (and to what I'm sure must have been the embarrassment of some of their friends, who might also be gossipers). Who can say for sure whether this is true, but I believe it. Because it makes the story in "Citizen Kane" more coherent and focused, when you consider that it is largely about a great and influential man who throws away all the goods things he has, simply because he's middle-aged crazy for a young juicy blonde. It's right there in the movie's story, it's as obvious and as clear as daylight (or a bolt of lightning), but I'll admit it never seemed for me to be the central focus of the story, which was made vague in part by the clever and amusing dodge about a child's sled. And so now for me the central and key scene of the movie is where Kane has been confronted about his mistress by his wife (thanks to the hardball-playing Governor), he's caught in the "love nest" with the juicy young blonde... and what does he do, he throws everything away, a good and beautiful wife, a promising political career, and ultimately the respect and even friendship of his closest friend, all because he's middle-aged crazy and foolish for ROSEBUD. I believe this is what Mankiewicz (and Welles) meant as part, if not most, of their film's criticism and ridicule of the powerful and influential Hearst, who is obviously the inspiration and model for the fictional Charles Foster Kane... that ridicule again being of a great (and potentially greater) man reducing himself to being foolish and ridiculous, all for a piece of Marion Davies. I think another scene which now carries a different and more significant meaning, is the one in the screening room, where the producer of the newsreel charges the reporter with finding out what 'rosebud' means, saying "it'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing..." And then immediately a FLASH OF LIGHTNING, showing Susan Alexander's face. Anyway, no doubt about it, an amazing film to watch, containing many other insights too, such as a rather scathing (but true) critique of Hearst's manipulative use of the powerful capital of a newspaper (a use that ranges from at first exposing Wall Street corruption and fraud, to selfishly claiming election fraud in Kane's political defeat). And as far as the now more significant element of the story of a man throwing away all good things for a piece of ROSEBUD, even if you don't believe that's what the word means (according to the film's writer), and even if you don't think that's the focus of the story, it's still a real thing, many men, especially men of "money and property" (because of the greater independence and luxury it grants them), throw away everything at the onset of middle-age, in a mad and foolish and ridiculous pursuit of young juicy snatch. Two things though: one, I don't know if it ever has anything to do with the man's mother, or his childhood, or least of all any toys he had as a boy... and two, it usually doesn't result in a movie being made about the man (and his high-profile public mistress), let alone one that discerning film fans and critics consistently rate as perhaps the greatest ever made.

    There will always be debate on where this film ranks all-time. It is not my personal favorite film, but I think it is one of the greatest films ever made. Why? Orson Welles. He wrote, directed, and produced the film. Oh, and he starred in it. At the time, it was not as common to direct and star in a movie. Did I mention he was only 25 years old when he did this? Is it a perfect film? Hardly. But it's not far off, either. I do not know of a single film that can be honestly called "perfect." Start by looking at the Goofs page because that needs to be empty for a film to be truly perfect. For people who want action movies or comedies, they will find Citizen Kane boring. If you prefer deep characters and, honestly, older dramas, I doubt you would come away from this film thinking it was a waste of your time.

    Citizen Kane laid, in 1941, the visual foundations of movies as we know them today, with groundbreaking shots, travellings and other matte paintings, as well as the flashback based non linear storytelling structure which has been used over and over since then, and this technical and innovative aspect is probably why this movie is considered by a lot of critics and institutions "the best of all time". Because if you think about the content, this is far from a masterpiece. The script is a long, disjointed and ultimately little interesting retrospective of Charles Kane life, where even the "Rosebud" plot turns out to be a letdown. If a remake, similar in every way, of Citizen Kane was made today, it would be considered average at best, which shows well that the historical context and the movie being some sort of pioneer influences the judgements a lot, at least more than the inherent quality of the film and its script in particular.

Anyway, no doubt about it, an amazing film to watch, containing many other insights too, such as a rather scathing (but true) critique of Hearst's manipulative use of the powerful capital of a newspaper (a use that ranges from at first exposing Wall Street corruption and fraud, to selfishly claiming election fraud in Kane's political defeat). And as far as the now more significant element of the story of a man throwing away all good things for a piece of ROSEBUD, even if you don't believe that's what the word means (according to the film's writer), and even if you don't think that's the focus of the story, it's still a real thing, many men, especially men of "money and property" (because of the greater independence and luxury it grants them), throw away everything at the onset of middle-age, in a mad and foolish and ridiculous pursuit of young juicy snatch. Two things though: one, I don't know if it ever has anything to do with the man's mother, or his childhood, or least of all any toys he had as a boy... and two, it usually doesn't result in a movie being made about the man (and his high-profile public mistress), let alone one that discerning film fans and critics consistently rate as perhaps the greatest ever made.

    There will always be debate on where this film ranks all-time. It is not my personal favorite film, but I think it is one of the greatest films ever made. Why? Orson Welles. He wrote, directed, and produced the film. Oh, and he starred in it. At the time, it was not as common to direct and star in a movie. Did I mention he was only 25 years old when he did this? Is it a perfect film? Hardly. But it's not far off, either. I do not know of a single film that can be honestly called "perfect." Start by looking at the Goofs page because that needs to be empty for a film to be truly perfect. For people who want action movies or comedies, they will find Citizen Kane boring. If you prefer deep characters and, honestly, older dramas, I doubt you would come away from this film thinking it was a waste of your time.

    Citizen Kane laid, in 1941, the visual foundations of movies as we know them today, with groundbreaking shots, travellings and other matte paintings, as well as the flashback based non linear storytelling structure which has been used over and over since then, and this technical and innovative aspect is probably why this movie is considered by a lot of critics and institutions "the best of all time". Because if you think about the content, this is far from a masterpiece. The script is a long, disjointed and ultimately little interesting retrospective of Charles Kane life, where even the "Rosebud" plot turns out to be a letdown. If a remake, similar in every way, of Citizen Kane was made today, it would be considered average at best, which shows well that the historical context and the movie being some sort of pioneer influences the judgements a lot, at least more than the inherent quality of the film and its script in particular.

    I don't know if there is such a thing as a "perfect" movie, but this comes as close as anything I have ever seen. I recently re-watched Citizen Kane for the first time since high school. I don't know why it took me so long to watch it again, probably because the first time I saw it I was a little underwhelmed. I'll just chalk that up to immaturity though, this is most certainly one of the best films I've ever seen. Students of film history can tell you all about the innovative camera techniques and such that make this film very important. I prefer to just focus on the actual experience of watching it. First of all, every scene (and I truly do mean every scene) is absolutely visually stunning. You could pretty much take any individual frame and hang it in a gallery, it is that meticulously put together. Aside from that, it's just a great story. I don't usually find biopics about "great men" very compelling, as they have a tendency to elevate people to this almost god-like, larger-than-life status that causes me to just become disconnected and not care at all about the main character. Citizen Kane does precisely the opposite, it takes a "great man" in the eyes of society and brings him down to a human level. Ultimately Kane is just like everyone else, a man in search of lasting happiness that proves more elusive than it seems it should. If you haven't seen Citizen Kane, or even if it's been a long time, then go watch it as soon as possible. You certainly will not regret it.

    I watched this movie because it is declared "the greatest American Movie of all time blah blah blah". While not a bad movie, I can't agree it's a masterpiece in this day and age. I thought the intro was compelling, but the longer the movie drags on and as his life starts to go down hill so does the entertainment value. It simply wasn't very interesting for me to see this rich economical juggernaut have these problems. Oh boo hoo he wasn't able to become a governor... not a very easy goal to relate to... His problems to find true love were somewhat more personable but still just seemed like annoying ladies who weren't satisfied with his business oriented lifestyle. For it's time period I would surely rate it at least an 8. But now a days I found this to be good, but in no way great. It was some what depressing and did not really have a solid enough message or good enough plot/entertainment value to make up for it's somber conclusion. 6/10 it's still a decent flick but it's age was apparent and it is somewhat hard to relate to the character or sympathize with him which I feel is necessary to give this a higher rating. His problems were either too extreme to relate to or too common to base a movie off of...

    Through all movies this is the score which I give to this one. For its time he deserves more. But we are in other moment of the time/space continuum. Most probably every one of us had period in his life in which he wanted to be very rich. To be famous and known from everybody. To wealth and fame we can add the utopian idea this character to be noble, selflessness, robinhoodian. And what is the price for this when it really happen? This movie shows the life of Charles Kane, personification of the mentioned image above. He, from flash and bones, lived in the beginning of the previous century. Torn apart from his native home and his parents, the real things which he has are friendship and love. But they could not fill the opened wound. About this - what we want and what we receive, how much our life is our property and about the value of the material goods. This movie intrigue with setting an aim which is pursued till its end. Shown as stories of different characters, documentary restores the portrait of the protagonist and the main story.

    The motion picture that, since its inception, has been widely regarded by almost all critics, filmmakers, and even viewers around the world as the greatest of all time. And Citizen Kane, technically, might be the most influential film of all time but based solely on its plot aspect, there are better examples. Still, Citizen Kane is a boldly crafted film that not only defied all the typical methods of filmmaking that were in use at its time but invented some new ones during its making that later became the foundation on which modern filmmaking canvas stands tall. While there is a lot to take in in this film, the best part of Citizen Kane remains its stupefying cinematography & the structure of its narration while the worst was, in simple words & in just my opinion, a relatively boring story. So boring that it took me six unsuccessful attempts to finish it. But once it was finished, the end result was surprisingly much better than what I had expected. An unusual portrayal of a larger than life character told through different people and assisted by its carefully crafted screenplay, innovative sharp focus photography, non-linear narration, inventive use of make-up, sound & transition effects, score & a strong central performance by Orson Welles in front as well as behind the camera makes Citizen Kane, the most experimental cinema of its time and its significance is simply as mysterious as the symbolism behind the word, 'Rosebud'.

    'Citizen Kane', Written, Directed & Acted by the late Orson Welles, is something so magical & poetic, it defines Cinema. I Have NEVER seen a film as good as 'Citizen Kane' since 'The Shawshank Redemption'. 'Citizen Kane' Synopsis: Following the death of a publishing tycoon, news reporters scramble to discover the meaning of his final utterance. 'Citizen Kane' is about The Great American Dream. The Protagonist, Charles Foster Kane, is one of the few people who achieve greatness on Celluloid. He lives his dream, rises above the normal commoner & even sees through The Great Depression. The Protagonist defines ambition, greed & one-man-ship. Its a supremely well-written character, that also explores emotions & has his share of outbursts. Orson Welles is at his greatest high as far as creativity & imagination are concerned. He delivers a story so compelling & magnetic, it's hard not to be stunned by his work. His Screenplay is flawless & utterly amazing. Every Sequence, Every Character, is magnificently written. His Direction can be described as a Study. He handles this Epic Human Tale, astoundingly. And as far as his Performance goes as Charles Foster Kane, he's impeccable. His performance elevates Charles Foster Kane to perfection. On the whole, 'Citizen Kane' is Cinema At Its FINEST! A True Masterpiece!

    Just before Susan leaves, she tells Charles that he doesn't love her, he just wants her to love him. This is such a powerful statement, as it essentially sums up the way Charles Kane relates to everyone else. There is a scene where a drunk Jedediah confronts Kane in a similar fashion, chiding the way Charles puts himself on a pedestal when associating himself to other people. Charles is selfish, but almost as a defence mechanism. His parents, having sent him away as a young boy, left him to cope with a deep sense of abandonment. He seeks to fill that void with the admiration of others, but on his own terms. Instead of giving of himself, he wants people to love him in exchange for things or rights or privileges - in essence, he wants to purchase love and loyalty. He is not willing to offer love in return. If his own parents could abandon him, what is there to stop anyone else from doing the same? He falls for Susan one fateful night, because she enjoys him for who he is, unaware of his wealth and influence. Their relationship fizzles, however, as he constantly tries to buy her affection by forcing on her a childhood dream of hers to be a singer. His wealth and influence is great enough to make her a relative success, but her lack of talent, combined with critical derision, sours the dream. She wants out, but Charles forces the issue by building her opera houses across the country. All Susan wants is the fun, caring Charles she met that first night, not the man using his status to purchase her love. She feels no different than the many statues he has set up around their enormous, vacuous palace. Charles ends up driving Susan away because of his inability to love and his incessant need for control. It is the same control he imposes upon everyone else in his life, as a way to manage his own anxiety. He puts up walls to prevent anyone else from hurting him. When Susan leaves him, he comes across a snow globe in her room that reminds him of his childhood home - the last place he truly felt whole. "Rosebud," that final utterance, is the object to which he pins his last true sense of innocence - something he has been searching for ever since.

    I guess at this point most people know that Citizen Kane has been named as "the greatest film in History" by the American Film Institute. Such thing can make you develop really high expectations that won't be met. At least that's what happened to me. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but it isn't that "terrific" either. The story isn't very interesting and I couldn't find myself emphasizing with anyone, not even Charles Foster Kane. While I admit the dialogue was clever and the use of light give the movie an interesting, eerie atmosphere, the story is boring at many points, and its message has been heard a thousand times over. It may have been revolutionary for its time, but it feels rather outdated now. It's considered a classic movie but it didn't do much for me (and I do like classic movies). Don't get me wrong, all in all I believe it's a good movie, but it doesn't deserve the title it has been given. You either agree with it or you don't, with no inbetweens.

    It seems quite a few "Citizen Kane" fans now know, or believe they know, that the word 'rosebud' was a clever inside joke on the part of screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz (and Orson Welles), because apparently it was a nickname William Randolph Hearst used for his high-profile public mistress, the hot and juicy Marion Davies (the nickname being a rather descriptive term for a part of the female anatomy). And it's my understanding they'd have known this because Hearst referred to Ms. Davies by this nickname in front of others (and to what I'm sure must have been the embarrassment of some of their friends, who might also be gossipers). Who can say for sure whether this is true, but I believe it. Because it makes the story in "Citizen Kane" more coherent and focused, when you consider that it is largely about a great and influential man who throws away all the goods things he has, simply because he's middle-aged crazy for a young juicy blonde. It's right there in the movie's story, it's as obvious and as clear as daylight (or a bolt of lightning), but I'll admit it never seemed for me to be the central focus of the story, which was made vague in part by the clever and amusing dodge about a child's sled. And so now for me the central and key scene of the movie is where Kane has been confronted about his mistress by his wife (thanks to the hardball-playing Governor), he's caught in the "love nest" with the juicy young blonde... and what does he do, he throws everything away, a good and beautiful wife, a promising political career, and ultimately the respect and even friendship of his closest friend, all because he's middle-aged crazy and foolish for ROSEBUD. I believe this is what Mankiewicz (and Welles) meant as part, if not most, of their film's criticism and ridicule of the powerful and influential Hearst, who is obviously the inspiration and model for the fictional Charles Foster Kane... that ridicule again being of a great (and potentially greater) man reducing himself to being foolish and ridiculous, all for a piece of Marion Davies. I think another scene which now carries a different and more significant meaning, is the one in the screening room, where the producer of the newsreel charges the reporter with finding out what 'rosebud' means, saying "it'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing..." And then immediately a FLASH OF LIGHTNING, showing Susan Alexander's face. Anyway, no doubt about it, an amazing film to watch, containing many other insights too, such as a rather scathing (but true) critique of Hearst's manipulative use of the powerful capital of a newspaper (a use that ranges from at first exposing Wall Street corruption and fraud, to selfishly claiming election fraud in Kane's political defeat).
