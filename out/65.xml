    The movie truthfully and realistically portrays how hard life is for people who are different, whether by beliefs, ideologies or simply have physical or mental disabilities, such as the two characters have one with autism and the other with obesity, it is very difficult to fit into a society when someone does not have the patterns dictated by consumer culture, accepts only people successful, intelligent, beautiful, and deeply insensitive surface, which are created by the official system. A beautiful and sad film, which brings out the evil and wicked that can become human beings with their peer. The film is an invitation to reflection and a warning about life proposes to be more sensitive, not judge anyone, loving and help to those who need it most.

    I gave this movie ten out of ten because it will touch your heart. Leonardo DiCaprio was nothing short of magic in his role, bringing the movie to a level that could never be achieved without him. The storyline was heartwarming, the characters were realistic and the parts were well cast. I had a bit of a problem with some things though; like John C Reilly's character. While he is a good actor and was nice to the Grape family in the movie, he didn't really have a developed personality. He didn't have a background or character development or even a reason of why he was so nice and helpful to the Grape family. Another thing I didn't like was the ambiguity of the ending. Amy finds a job in a new town after the house burns down and Ellen moves away with her which is a happy ending for both of them but Gilbert and Arnie just go where they want to go....? You see him reconnecting with his girlfriend when she comes back to visit, but the bag he's carrying kind of implies that he doesn't have a house. I thought the ending could have been though out better, because there is no way he could take care of his brother with a life of hitch hiking and his grocery job. But don't let my review ruin the movie for you. As I said, that was implied but you don't really know how they are living. The movie also had many good parts, which I don't have room to fit all of them in and it is definitely worth seeing.

    What's Eating Gilbert Grape? is a good movie but it's not great. Since two of my all time favourite actors are in it (the amazing Johnny Depp and Leonardo Di Caprio who I didn't even know was nominated for an Oscar in this) I thought it was going to be an amazing movie. Maybe I set my expectations too high and set myself up for disappointment. Depp is really good, not as awesome as usual but he's younger and did a very good job. Di Caprio does very well and I would say awesome for his age as a mentally challenged boy. The movie is basically about Depp dealing with his family (brother Di Caprio and an extremely overweight mother who is so big Depp literally has to put support beams up in the basement and can not fit through her house's doors. I don't want to wreck the ending, it's very good, the mother is a good actress. It's one of those things where the parts are better than the movie they add up to be if that makes sense. Direction/writing I suspect could have been better. But the ending is emotional and a good way to leave off the movie.

    A movie eventually make you feel happy or cry or anything which you can explain, but I bet you, you are not gonna explain about your feelings after watching this movie. To learn about family bonding, affections, togetherness- don't forget to make it watched. Thanks Johnny Depp to perform a responsible acting. And Caprio did a superb job. I just forget that it's Caprio, not a brain damaged teenaged boy. Most important and amazing part of this movie is to being Gilbert freed. Audience must feel Gilbert not gonna be freed because of her brother. But it's not him it's his mom. I really really love this movie. And gonna watch it when I'll be feel lost.

    What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) **** (out of 4) Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) tries adjusting to his small town where the weight of the world is on his shoulders. He must try and take care of his eccentric family including his retarded brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), his obese mother (Darlene Cates) as well as try and keeps his affair with a married woman (Mary Streenburgen) quiet. After meeting a stranger (Juliette Lewis) he begins to think that he might be better served just leaving the town and his family behind. I watched this movie when it was first released and thought it was extremely good but I think it's safe to say that time has been very good to the film as its not only shaped into a classic but I think it's improved all around. I think the movie is just about as perfect as you can get in showing someone who is just at the end of everything including being fed up with their life and the burden of the expectations that are on them. This here is where the film is so special because the Gilbert character really does feel like a real person who just wants to escape but can't find a way to do it. The film was incredibly realistic and I think it manages to be rather heartbreaking along the way even though there are certainly bits of romance and comedy scattered throughout. The greatest thing going are without question the performances. DiCaprio turns in one of the greatest performances that you're ever going to see as the mentally challenged Arnie. Just the way he performs the character is something really special to watch as he's got some perfect small touches and not for a second do you ever believe you're just watching an actor do a part. The supporting cast is terrific with Lewis, Steenburgen, Cates, John C. Reilly, Crispin Glover and Kevin Tighe perfectly fitting their roles. Depp, and everyone for that matter, were overlooked due to how great DiCaprio was but I think he too gives one of the better performances of his career. Everyone's gotten so used to his over-the-top and flashy characters that it's pretty amazing to see him play the opposite. The film has so many touching and memorable scenes and the director really pulls them all together wonderfully. Classics get better over time and I think this is a perfect example of that.

    Notice that the title of this film does not end with a question mark. It is not a thriller or a mystery; it is simply a visual description of the problems affecting a family with problems. The movie follows the daily life of an unhappy young man by the name of Gilbert who is dealing with caring for an autistic younger brother and a morbidly obese mother. This is a film that I believe everyone should see because it gives you a must greater respect for obese people and for caretakers in general. The acting is top-notch with an exceptional performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as the autistic boy. When everything comes together, what you get is a sad and moving experience.

    I read in a review that everyone will connect to a character in this movie, i couldn't agree more, it truly was one the best drama films ever seen, the movie and the character's grow onto you with their dedicated performances... i never liked the mother's part in the beginning , but towards the end i found her the most beautiful to be, specially when she says " i never wanted to be this way" .... then you realize how pretty someone looks when you look in their eyes , and not just the beauty from the outside... each and every character has played a perfect part, i love how patiently johnny depp plays his role, and you can imagine how frustrated one would be in his shoes.... but the point of life is you cant give up ! you have to give it all what it takes to love your family and be non-judge mental , cause everyone has their own limitations and problems... Great work by Leonardo di caprio, to play his character so beautifully at such a young age that too...

    This film certainly suits the description of being an underrated, forgotten classic! As school is about to start soon, one of our curricular assessments is based on the film so I went in, expecting a very disappointing and boring movie. What I eventually got was something that was funny, exciting and emotional that I didn't know would EVER happen! The biggest strength in this movie, to me, is undeniably its GREAT acting! The star of the movie, as many would say, is definitely a young Leonardo DiCaprio would unfortunately would not get the Oscar as Liam Neeson wins if for Schindler's List. Its unfortunate that this movie came out in the same year that the Winner of 7 Academy Awards, Schindler's List came out in. Johnny Depp himself is absolutely brilliant playing the family supporting brother who perfectly illustrates his character. The story never slows down. Its a fast paced drama from start to finish filled with much humor and emotion. The greatest thing about it all is that we personally care for all the characters in this film. The character I most cared about in this film was not Arnie or Gilbert, it was their obese mother, Bonnie. I found her the character I could feel for the most, imagining if the same had actually happened to my mother, how I would feel. Something I also love in this film is that despite a lot of humorous moments, the movie NEVER fails to fall out of its tone. The whole way through we care about these characters and find it so emotional when things to do eventually go wrong. The ending of the film was so powerful that if this film were to be brought back into cinemas, the final scene alone is worth the price of admission. For any who have not checked out this film, it certainly is a classical, underrated movie that is sure to leave you in tears for a good 120 minutes!

    You know there are a lot of movies to watch. But one Night I stumbled upon this DVD in my friends collection. This movie is quite personal to me. I know what it means to stick around for the family, and how trapped you are, as the eldest son. I like the way in which the movie is set, a small lonely country town, far away from the urban fuzz. A mother who has let herself go, and her two elder kids who work hard to make the ends meet, a challenged 3rd, and a 16old last girl. Elder son has to work for the bread, he is actually shown as if he is replacing his deceased father, but when he looks for his future calling(a girl) he is facing a dilemma whether to just quit or to stick around. I just like the acting, DiCaprio is a prodigy, such a great performance at such an young age. And Johnny Depp has proved it time and again that he can do it in his way, Great. I suggest, you pull your brother, your sister and your parents in, and give this movie its time.

    Endora, a small town in rural Iowa, is home to Gilbert Grape and his family. After his father committed suicide some time earlier his mother fell into a state of depression and became morbidly obese; now she doesn't even leave the house and his younger brother Arnie is mentally disabled. It is up to Gilbert and his to sisters to look after there mother and Arnie. Gilbert acts as friend and protector to his brother; it isn't easy though as he is almost eighteen but has the mind of a young child... when a child in the body of an eighteen year old decides to be naughty it can be difficult for those around him. Arnie loves climbing; he spends much of his time up various trees, he also loves climbing the town's water tower; he finds it exciting but it is obviously very dangerous. Not much happens in Endora; in fact so little happens that watching the procession of holiday makers' trailers each year is one of the things Arnie looks forward to; this year one of them will have quite of an effect on them; Becky and her mother are travelling through when their car breaks down; it will take a week or so to get the part they need and in that time Becky will have quite an effect on Gilbert. If you are looking for action and excitement or a constant stream of laughs then this isn't the film for you; however if you want a gentle story with characters who seem real, with moments of comedy, romance and tragedy then this might be just the film you are looking for. The film has a melancholy feel; Endora feels like a town that time passed by; less and less people go to the grocery store Gilbert works at because a new out of town shopping centre has been built and Gilbert's friend Tucker sees the arrival of a new Burger Barn way of getting a job with good prospects! It isn't all downbeat though; Arnie's childlike enthusiasm for life is heart-warming even if his condition makes things difficult for his family and the arrival of Becky, a beautiful girl who will only be there a week or so clearly lightens Gilbert's mood. The cast does a fine job; Johnny Depp puts in a nicely restrained performance as Gilbert; Leonardo DiCaprio is great as Arnie; one of the best performances I've seen him give and Juliette Lewis was just right as Becky; there was something almost ethereal about her which was ideal for a character who was just passing though. Also of note is Darlene Cates who put in a fine performance as the mother despite not acting before this film. Over the course of the film expect to laugh and cry but ultimately be left with a smile on your face.

    Endora, a small town in rural Iowa, is home to Gilbert Grape and his family. After his father committed suicide some time earlier his mother fell into a state of depression and became morbidly obese; now she doesn't even leave the house and his younger brother Arnie is mentally disabled. It is up to Gilbert and his to sisters to look after there mother and Arnie. Gilbert acts as friend and protector to his brother; it isn't easy though as he is almost eighteen but has the mind of a young child... when a child in the body of an eighteen year old decides to be naughty it can be difficult for those around him. Arnie loves climbing; he spends much of his time up various trees, he also loves climbing the town's water tower; he finds it exciting but it is obviously very dangerous. Not much happens in Endora; in fact so little happens that watching the procession of holiday makers' trailers each year is one of the things Arnie looks forward to; this year one of them will have quite of an effect on them; Becky and her mother are travelling through when their car breaks down; it will take a week or so to get the part they need and in that time Becky will have quite an effect on Gilbert. If you are looking for action and excitement or a constant stream of laughs then this isn't the film for you; however if you want a gentle story with characters who seem real, with moments of comedy, romance and tragedy then this might be just the film you are looking for. The film has a melancholy feel; Endora feels like a town that time passed by; less and less people go to the grocery store Gilbert works at because a new out of town shopping centre has been built and Gilbert's friend Tucker sees the arrival of a new Burger Barn way of getting a job with good prospects! It isn't all downbeat though; Arnie's childlike enthusiasm for life is heart-warming even if his condition makes things difficult for his family and the arrival of Becky, a beautiful girl who will only be there a week or so clearly lightens Gilbert's mood. The cast does a fine job; Johnny Depp puts in a nicely restrained performance as Gilbert; Leonardo DiCaprio is great as Arnie; one of the best performances I've seen him give and Juliette Lewis was just right as Becky; there was something almost ethereal about her which was ideal for a character who was just passing though. Also of note is Darlene Cates who put in a fine performance as the mother despite not acting before this film. Over the course of the film expect to laugh and cry but ultimately be left with a smile on your face.

    The movie truthfully and realistically portrays how hard life is for people who are different, whether by beliefs, ideologies or simply have physical or mental disabilities, such as the two characters have one with autism and the other with obesity, it is very difficult to fit into a society when someone does not have the patterns dictated by consumer culture, accepts only people successful, intelligent, beautiful, and deeply insensitive surface, which are created by the official system. A beautiful and sad film, which brings out the evil and wicked that can become human beings with their peer. The film is an invitation to reflection and a warning about life proposes to be more sensitive, not judge anyone, loving and help to those who need it most.

    I gave this movie ten out of ten because it will touch your heart. Leonardo DiCaprio was nothing short of magic in his role, bringing the movie to a level that could never be achieved without him. The storyline was heartwarming, the characters were realistic and the parts were well cast. I had a bit of a problem with some things though; like John C Reilly's character. While he is a good actor and was nice to the Grape family in the movie, he didn't really have a developed personality. He didn't have a background or character development or even a reason of why he was so nice and helpful to the Grape family. Another thing I didn't like was the ambiguity of the ending. Amy finds a job in a new town after the house burns down and Ellen moves away with her which is a happy ending for both of them but Gilbert and Arnie just go where they want to go....? You see him reconnecting with his girlfriend when she comes back to visit, but the bag he's carrying kind of implies that he doesn't have a house. I thought the ending could have been though out better, because there is no way he could take care of his brother with a life of hitch hiking and his grocery job. But don't let my review ruin the movie for you. As I said, that was implied but you don't really know how they are living. The movie also had many good parts, which I don't have room to fit all of them in and it is definitely worth seeing.

    What's Eating Gilbert Grape? is a good movie but it's not great. Since two of my all time favourite actors are in it (the amazing Johnny Depp and Leonardo Di Caprio who I didn't even know was nominated for an Oscar in this) I thought it was going to be an amazing movie. Maybe I set my expectations too high and set myself up for disappointment. Depp is really good, not as awesome as usual but he's younger and did a very good job. Di Caprio does very well and I would say awesome for his age as a mentally challenged boy. The movie is basically about Depp dealing with his family (brother Di Caprio and an extremely overweight mother who is so big Depp literally has to put support beams up in the basement and can not fit through her house's doors. I don't want to wreck the ending, it's very good, the mother is a good actress. It's one of those things where the parts are better than the movie they add up to be if that makes sense. Direction/writing I suspect could have been better. But the ending is emotional and a good way to leave off the movie.

    A movie eventually make you feel happy or cry or anything which you can explain, but I bet you, you are not gonna explain about your feelings after watching this movie. To learn about family bonding, affections, togetherness- don't forget to make it watched. Thanks Johnny Depp to perform a responsible acting. And Caprio did a superb job. I just forget that it's Caprio, not a brain damaged teenaged boy. Most important and amazing part of this movie is to being Gilbert freed. Audience must feel Gilbert not gonna be freed because of her brother. But it's not him it's his mom. I really really love this movie. And gonna watch it when I'll be feel lost.

    What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) **** (out of 4) Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) tries adjusting to his small town where the weight of the world is on his shoulders. He must try and take care of his eccentric family including his retarded brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), his obese mother (Darlene Cates) as well as try and keeps his affair with a married woman (Mary Streenburgen) quiet. After meeting a stranger (Juliette Lewis) he begins to think that he might be better served just leaving the town and his family behind. I watched this movie when it was first released and thought it was extremely good but I think it's safe to say that time has been very good to the film as its not only shaped into a classic but I think it's improved all around. I think the movie is just about as perfect as you can get in showing someone who is just at the end of everything including being fed up with their life and the burden of the expectations that are on them. This here is where the film is so special because the Gilbert character really does feel like a real person who just wants to escape but can't find a way to do it. The film was incredibly realistic and I think it manages to be rather heartbreaking along the way even though there are certainly bits of romance and comedy scattered throughout. The greatest thing going are without question the performances. DiCaprio turns in one of the greatest performances that you're ever going to see as the mentally challenged Arnie. Just the way he performs the character is something really special to watch as he's got some perfect small touches and not for a second do you ever believe you're just watching an actor do a part. The supporting cast is terrific with Lewis, Steenburgen, Cates, John C. Reilly, Crispin Glover and Kevin Tighe perfectly fitting their roles. Depp, and everyone for that matter, were overlooked due to how great DiCaprio was but I think he too gives one of the better performances of his career. Everyone's gotten so used to his over-the-top and flashy characters that it's pretty amazing to see him play the opposite. The film has so many touching and memorable scenes and the director really pulls them all together wonderfully. Classics get better over time and I think this is a perfect example of that.

    Notice that the title of this film does not end with a question mark. It is not a thriller or a mystery; it is simply a visual description of the problems affecting a family with problems. The movie follows the daily life of an unhappy young man by the name of Gilbert who is dealing with caring for an autistic younger brother and a morbidly obese mother. This is a film that I believe everyone should see because it gives you a must greater respect for obese people and for caretakers in general. The acting is top-notch with an exceptional performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as the autistic boy. When everything comes together, what you get is a sad and moving experience.

    I read in a review that everyone will connect to a character in this movie, i couldn't agree more, it truly was one the best drama films ever seen, the movie and the character's grow onto you with their dedicated performances... i never liked the mother's part in the beginning , but towards the end i found her the most beautiful to be, specially when she says " i never wanted to be this way" .... then you realize how pretty someone looks when you look in their eyes , and not just the beauty from the outside... each and every character has played a perfect part, i love how patiently johnny depp plays his role, and you can imagine how frustrated one would be in his shoes.... but the point of life is you cant give up ! you have to give it all what it takes to love your family and be non-judge mental , cause everyone has their own limitations and problems... Great work by Leonardo di caprio, to play his character so beautifully at such a young age that too...

    This film certainly suits the description of being an underrated, forgotten classic! As school is about to start soon, one of our curricular assessments is based on the film so I went in, expecting a very disappointing and boring movie. What I eventually got was something that was funny, exciting and emotional that I didn't know would EVER happen! The biggest strength in this movie, to me, is undeniably its GREAT acting! The star of the movie, as many would say, is definitely a young Leonardo DiCaprio would unfortunately would not get the Oscar as Liam Neeson wins if for Schindler's List. Its unfortunate that this movie came out in the same year that the Winner of 7 Academy Awards, Schindler's List came out in. Johnny Depp himself is absolutely brilliant playing the family supporting brother who perfectly illustrates his character. The story never slows down. Its a fast paced drama from start to finish filled with much humor and emotion. The greatest thing about it all is that we personally care for all the characters in this film. The character I most cared about in this film was not Arnie or Gilbert, it was their obese mother, Bonnie. I found her the character I could feel for the most, imagining if the same had actually happened to my mother, how I would feel. Something I also love in this film is that despite a lot of humorous moments, the movie NEVER fails to fall out of its tone. The whole way through we care about these characters and find it so emotional when things to do eventually go wrong. The ending of the film was so powerful that if this film were to be brought back into cinemas, the final scene alone is worth the price of admission. For any who have not checked out this film, it certainly is a classical, underrated movie that is sure to leave you in tears for a good 120 minutes!

    You know there are a lot of movies to watch. But one Night I stumbled upon this DVD in my friends collection. This movie is quite personal to me. I know what it means to stick around for the family, and how trapped you are, as the eldest son. I like the way in which the movie is set, a small lonely country town, far away from the urban fuzz. A mother who has let herself go, and her two elder kids who work hard to make the ends meet, a challenged 3rd, and a 16old last girl. Elder son has to work for the bread, he is actually shown as if he is replacing his deceased father, but when he looks for his future calling(a girl) he is facing a dilemma whether to just quit or to stick around. I just like the acting, DiCaprio is a prodigy, such a great performance at such an young age. And Johnny Depp has proved it time and again that he can do it in his way, Great. I suggest, you pull your brother, your sister and your parents in, and give this movie its time.

    Endora, a small town in rural Iowa, is home to Gilbert Grape and his family. After his father committed suicide some time earlier his mother fell into a state of depression and became morbidly obese; now she doesn't even leave the house and his younger brother Arnie is mentally disabled. It is up to Gilbert and his to sisters to look after there mother and Arnie. Gilbert acts as friend and protector to his brother; it isn't easy though as he is almost eighteen but has the mind of a young child... when a child in the body of an eighteen year old decides to be naughty it can be difficult for those around him. Arnie loves climbing; he spends much of his time up various trees, he also loves climbing the town's water tower; he finds it exciting but it is obviously very dangerous. Not much happens in Endora; in fact so little happens that watching the procession of holiday makers' trailers each year is one of the things Arnie looks forward to; this year one of them will have quite of an effect on them; Becky and her mother are travelling through when their car breaks down; it will take a week or so to get the part they need and in that time Becky will have quite an effect on Gilbert. If you are looking for action and excitement or a constant stream of laughs then this isn't the film for you; however if you want a gentle story with characters who seem real, with moments of comedy, romance and tragedy then this might be just the film you are looking for. The film has a melancholy feel; Endora feels like a town that time passed by; less and less people go to the grocery store Gilbert works at because a new out of town shopping centre has been built and Gilbert's friend Tucker sees the arrival of a new Burger Barn way of getting a job with good prospects! It isn't all downbeat though; Arnie's childlike enthusiasm for life is heart-warming even if his condition makes things difficult for his family and the arrival of Becky, a beautiful girl who will only be there a week or so clearly lightens Gilbert's mood. The cast does a fine job; Johnny Depp puts in a nicely restrained performance as Gilbert; Leonardo DiCaprio is great as Arnie; one of the best performances I've seen him give and Juliette Lewis was just right as Becky; there was something almost ethereal about her which was ideal for a character who was just passing though. Also of note is Darlene Cates who put in a fine performance as the mother despite not acting before this film. Over the course of the film expect to laugh and cry but ultimately be left with a smile on your face.

    The movie truthfully and realistically portrays how hard life is for people who are different, whether by beliefs, ideologies or simply have physical or mental disabilities, such as the two characters have one with autism and the other with obesity, it is very difficult to fit into a society when someone does not have the patterns dictated by consumer culture, accepts only people successful, intelligent, beautiful, and deeply insensitive surface, which are created by the official system. A beautiful and sad film, which brings out the evil and wicked that can become human beings with their peer. The film is an invitation to reflection and a warning about life proposes to be more sensitive, not judge anyone, loving and help to those who need it most.

    I gave this movie ten out of ten because it will touch your heart. Leonardo DiCaprio was nothing short of magic in his role, bringing the movie to a level that could never be achieved without him. The storyline was heartwarming, the characters were realistic and the parts were well cast. I had a bit of a problem with some things though; like John C Reilly's character. While he is a good actor and was nice to the Grape family in the movie, he didn't really have a developed personality. He didn't have a background or character development or even a reason of why he was so nice and helpful to the Grape family. Another thing I didn't like was the ambiguity of the ending. Amy finds a job in a new town after the house burns down and Ellen moves away with her which is a happy ending for both of them but Gilbert and Arnie just go where they want to go....? You see him reconnecting with his girlfriend when she comes back to visit, but the bag he's carrying kind of implies that he doesn't have a house. I thought the ending could have been though out better, because there is no way he could take care of his brother with a life of hitch hiking and his grocery job. But don't let my review ruin the movie for you. As I said, that was implied but you don't really know how they are living. The movie also had many good parts, which I don't have room to fit all of them in and it is definitely worth seeing.

    What's Eating Gilbert Grape? is a good movie but it's not great. Since two of my all time favourite actors are in it (the amazing Johnny Depp and Leonardo Di Caprio who I didn't even know was nominated for an Oscar in this) I thought it was going to be an amazing movie. Maybe I set my expectations too high and set myself up for disappointment. Depp is really good, not as awesome as usual but he's younger and did a very good job. Di Caprio does very well and I would say awesome for his age as a mentally challenged boy. The movie is basically about Depp dealing with his family (brother Di Caprio and an extremely overweight mother who is so big Depp literally has to put support beams up in the basement and can not fit through her house's doors. I don't want to wreck the ending, it's very good, the mother is a good actress. It's one of those things where the parts are better than the movie they add up to be if that makes sense. Direction/writing I suspect could have been better. But the ending is emotional and a good way to leave off the movie.

    A movie eventually make you feel happy or cry or anything which you can explain, but I bet you, you are not gonna explain about your feelings after watching this movie. To learn about family bonding, affections, togetherness- don't forget to make it watched. Thanks Johnny Depp to perform a responsible acting. And Caprio did a superb job. I just forget that it's Caprio, not a brain damaged teenaged boy. Most important and amazing part of this movie is to being Gilbert freed. Audience must feel Gilbert not gonna be freed because of her brother. But it's not him it's his mom. I really really love this movie. And gonna watch it when I'll be feel lost.

    What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) **** (out of 4) Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) tries adjusting to his small town where the weight of the world is on his shoulders. He must try and take care of his eccentric family including his retarded brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), his obese mother (Darlene Cates) as well as try and keeps his affair with a married woman (Mary Streenburgen) quiet. After meeting a stranger (Juliette Lewis) he begins to think that he might be better served just leaving the town and his family behind. I watched this movie when it was first released and thought it was extremely good but I think it's safe to say that time has been very good to the film as its not only shaped into a classic but I think it's improved all around. I think the movie is just about as perfect as you can get in showing someone who is just at the end of everything including being fed up with their life and the burden of the expectations that are on them. This here is where the film is so special because the Gilbert character really does feel like a real person who just wants to escape but can't find a way to do it. The film was incredibly realistic and I think it manages to be rather heartbreaking along the way even though there are certainly bits of romance and comedy scattered throughout. The greatest thing going are without question the performances. DiCaprio turns in one of the greatest performances that you're ever going to see as the mentally challenged Arnie. Just the way he performs the character is something really special to watch as he's got some perfect small touches and not for a second do you ever believe you're just watching an actor do a part. The supporting cast is terrific with Lewis, Steenburgen, Cates, John C. Reilly, Crispin Glover and Kevin Tighe perfectly fitting their roles. Depp, and everyone for that matter, were overlooked due to how great DiCaprio was but I think he too gives one of the better performances of his career. Everyone's gotten so used to his over-the-top and flashy characters that it's pretty amazing to see him play the opposite. The film has so many touching and memorable scenes and the director really pulls them all together wonderfully. Classics get better over time and I think this is a perfect example of that.

    Notice that the title of this film does not end with a question mark. It is not a thriller or a mystery; it is simply a visual description of the problems affecting a family with problems. The movie follows the daily life of an unhappy young man by the name of Gilbert who is dealing with caring for an autistic younger brother and a morbidly obese mother. This is a film that I believe everyone should see because it gives you a must greater respect for obese people and for caretakers in general. The acting is top-notch with an exceptional performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as the autistic boy. When everything comes together, what you get is a sad and moving experience.

    I read in a review that everyone will connect to a character in this movie, i couldn't agree more, it truly was one the best drama films ever seen, the movie and the character's grow onto you with their dedicated performances... i never liked the mother's part in the beginning , but towards the end i found her the most beautiful to be, specially when she says " i never wanted to be this way" .... then you realize how pretty someone looks when you look in their eyes , and not just the beauty from the outside... each and every character has played a perfect part, i love how patiently johnny depp plays his role, and you can imagine how frustrated one would be in his shoes.... but the point of life is you cant give up ! you have to give it all what it takes to love your family and be non-judge mental , cause everyone has their own limitations and problems... Great work by Leonardo di caprio, to play his character so beautifully at such a young age that too...

    This film certainly suits the description of being an underrated, forgotten classic! As school is about to start soon, one of our curricular assessments is based on the film so I went in, expecting a very disappointing and boring movie. What I eventually got was something that was funny, exciting and emotional that I didn't know would EVER happen! The biggest strength in this movie, to me, is undeniably its GREAT acting! The star of the movie, as many would say, is definitely a young Leonardo DiCaprio would unfortunately would not get the Oscar as Liam Neeson wins if for Schindler's List. Its unfortunate that this movie came out in the same year that the Winner of 7 Academy Awards, Schindler's List came out in. Johnny Depp himself is absolutely brilliant playing the family supporting brother who perfectly illustrates his character. The story never slows down. Its a fast paced drama from start to finish filled with much humor and emotion. The greatest thing about it all is that we personally care for all the characters in this film. The character I most cared about in this film was not Arnie or Gilbert, it was their obese mother, Bonnie. I found her the character I could feel for the most, imagining if the same had actually happened to my mother, how I would feel. Something I also love in this film is that despite a lot of humorous moments, the movie NEVER fails to fall out of its tone. The whole way through we care about these characters and find it so emotional when things to do eventually go wrong. The ending of the film was so powerful that if this film were to be brought back into cinemas, the final scene alone is worth the price of admission. For any who have not checked out this film, it certainly is a classical, underrated movie that is sure to leave you in tears for a good 120 minutes!

    You know there are a lot of movies to watch. But one Night I stumbled upon this DVD in my friends collection. This movie is quite personal to me. I know what it means to stick around for the family, and how trapped you are, as the eldest son. I like the way in which the movie is set, a small lonely country town, far away from the urban fuzz. A mother who has let herself go, and her two elder kids who work hard to make the ends meet, a challenged 3rd, and a 16old last girl. Elder son has to work for the bread, he is actually shown as if he is replacing his deceased father, but when he looks for his future calling(a girl) he is facing a dilemma whether to just quit or to stick around. I just like the acting, DiCaprio is a prodigy, such a great performance at such an young age. And Johnny Depp has proved it time and again that he can do it in his way, Great. I suggest, you pull your brother, your sister and your parents in, and give this movie its time.

After his father committed suicide some time earlier his mother fell into a state of depression and became morbidly obese; now she doesn't even leave the house and his younger brother Arnie is mentally disabled. It is up to Gilbert and his to sisters to look after there mother and Arnie. Gilbert acts as friend and protector to his brother; it isn't easy though as he is almost eighteen but has the mind of a young child... when a child in the body of an eighteen year old decides to be naughty it can be difficult for those around him. Arnie loves climbing; he spends much of his time up various trees, he also loves climbing the town's water tower; he finds it exciting but it is obviously very dangerous. Not much happens in Endora; in fact so little happens that watching the procession of holiday makers' trailers each year is one of the things Arnie looks forward to; this year one of them will have quite of an effect on them; Becky and her mother are travelling through when their car breaks down; it will take a week or so to get the part they need and in that time Becky will have quite an effect on Gilbert. If you are looking for action and excitement or a constant stream of laughs then this isn't the film for you; however if you want a gentle story with characters who seem real, with moments of comedy, romance and tragedy then this might be just the film you are looking for. The film has a melancholy feel; Endora feels like a town that time passed by; less and less people go to the grocery store Gilbert works at because a new out of town shopping centre has been built and Gilbert's friend Tucker sees the arrival of a new Burger Barn way of getting a job with good prospects! It isn't all downbeat though; Arnie's childlike enthusiasm for life is heart-warming even if his condition makes things difficult for his family and the arrival of Becky, a beautiful girl who will only be there a week or so clearly lightens Gilbert's mood. The cast does a fine job; Johnny Depp puts in a nicely restrained performance as Gilbert; Leonardo DiCaprio is great as Arnie; one of the best performances I've seen him give and Juliette Lewis was just right as Becky; there was something almost ethereal about her which was ideal for a character who was just passing though. Also of note is Darlene Cates who put in a fine performance as the mother despite not acting before this film. Over the course of the film expect to laugh and cry but ultimately be left with a smile on your face.

    The movie truthfully and realistically portrays how hard life is for people who are different, whether by beliefs, ideologies or simply have physical or mental disabilities, such as the two characters have one with autism and the other with obesity, it is very difficult to fit into a society when someone does not have the patterns dictated by consumer culture, accepts only people successful, intelligent, beautiful, and deeply insensitive surface, which are created by the official system. A beautiful and sad film, which brings out the evil and wicked that can become human beings with their peer. The film is an invitation to reflection and a warning about life proposes to be more sensitive, not judge anyone, loving and help to those who need it most.

    I gave this movie ten out of ten because it will touch your heart. Leonardo DiCaprio was nothing short of magic in his role, bringing the movie to a level that could never be achieved without him. The storyline was heartwarming, the characters were realistic and the parts were well cast. I had a bit of a problem with some things though; like John C Reilly's character. While he is a good actor and was nice to the Grape family in the movie, he didn't really have a developed personality. He didn't have a background or character development or even a reason of why he was so nice and helpful to the Grape family. Another thing I didn't like was the ambiguity of the ending. Amy finds a job in a new town after the house burns down and Ellen moves away with her which is a happy ending for both of them but Gilbert and Arnie just go where they want to go....? You see him reconnecting with his girlfriend when she comes back to visit, but the bag he's carrying kind of implies that he doesn't have a house. I thought the ending could have been though out better, because there is no way he could take care of his brother with a life of hitch hiking and his grocery job. But don't let my review ruin the movie for you. As I said, that was implied but you don't really know how they are living. The movie also had many good parts, which I don't have room to fit all of them in and it is definitely worth seeing.

    What's Eating Gilbert Grape? is a good movie but it's not great. Since two of my all time favourite actors are in it (the amazing Johnny Depp and Leonardo Di Caprio who I didn't even know was nominated for an Oscar in this) I thought it was going to be an amazing movie. Maybe I set my expectations too high and set myself up for disappointment. Depp is really good, not as awesome as usual but he's younger and did a very good job. Di Caprio does very well and I would say awesome for his age as a mentally challenged boy. The movie is basically about Depp dealing with his family (brother Di Caprio and an extremely overweight mother who is so big Depp literally has to put support beams up in the basement and can not fit through her house's doors. I don't want to wreck the ending, it's very good, the mother is a good actress. It's one of those things where the parts are better than the movie they add up to be if that makes sense. Direction/writing I suspect could have been better. But the ending is emotional and a good way to leave off the movie.

    A movie eventually make you feel happy or cry or anything which you can explain, but I bet you, you are not gonna explain about your feelings after watching this movie. To learn about family bonding, affections, togetherness- don't forget to make it watched. Thanks Johnny Depp to perform a responsible acting. And Caprio did a superb job. I just forget that it's Caprio, not a brain damaged teenaged boy. Most important and amazing part of this movie is to being Gilbert freed. Audience must feel Gilbert not gonna be freed because of her brother. But it's not him it's his mom. I really really love this movie. And gonna watch it when I'll be feel lost.

    What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) **** (out of 4) Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) tries adjusting to his small town where the weight of the world is on his shoulders. He must try and take care of his eccentric family including his retarded brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), his obese mother (Darlene Cates) as well as try and keeps his affair with a married woman (Mary Streenburgen) quiet. After meeting a stranger (Juliette Lewis) he begins to think that he might be better served just leaving the town and his family behind. I watched this movie when it was first released and thought it was extremely good but I think it's safe to say that time has been very good to the film as its not only shaped into a classic but I think it's improved all around. I think the movie is just about as perfect as you can get in showing someone who is just at the end of everything including being fed up with their life and the burden of the expectations that are on them. This here is where the film is so special because the Gilbert character really does feel like a real person who just wants to escape but can't find a way to do it. The film was incredibly realistic and I think it manages to be rather heartbreaking along the way even though there are certainly bits of romance and comedy scattered throughout. The greatest thing going are without question the performances. DiCaprio turns in one of the greatest performances that you're ever going to see as the mentally challenged Arnie. Just the way he performs the character is something really special to watch as he's got some perfect small touches and not for a second do you ever believe you're just watching an actor do a part. The supporting cast is terrific with Lewis, Steenburgen, Cates, John C. Reilly, Crispin Glover and Kevin Tighe perfectly fitting their roles. Depp, and everyone for that matter, were overlooked due to how great DiCaprio was but I think he too gives one of the better performances of his career. Everyone's gotten so used to his over-the-top and flashy characters that it's pretty amazing to see him play the opposite. The film has so many touching and memorable scenes and the director really pulls them all together wonderfully. Classics get better over time and I think this is a perfect example of that.

    Notice that the title of this film does not end with a question mark. It is not a thriller or a mystery; it is simply a visual description of the problems affecting a family with problems. The movie follows the daily life of an unhappy young man by the name of Gilbert who is dealing with caring for an autistic younger brother and a morbidly obese mother. This is a film that I believe everyone should see because it gives you a must greater respect for obese people and for caretakers in general. The acting is top-notch with an exceptional performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as the autistic boy. When everything comes together, what you get is a sad and moving experience.

    I read in a review that everyone will connect to a character in this movie, i couldn't agree more, it truly was one the best drama films ever seen, the movie and the character's grow onto you with their dedicated performances... i never liked the mother's part in the beginning , but towards the end i found her the most beautiful to be, specially when she says " i never wanted to be this way" .... then you realize how pretty someone looks when you look in their eyes , and not just the beauty from the outside... each and every character has played a perfect part, i love how patiently johnny depp plays his role, and you can imagine how frustrated one would be in his shoes.... but the point of life is you cant give up ! you have to give it all what it takes to love your family and be non-judge mental , cause everyone has their own limitations and problems... Great work by Leonardo di caprio, to play his character so beautifully at such a young age that too...

    This film certainly suits the description of being an underrated, forgotten classic! As school is about to start soon, one of our curricular assessments is based on the film so I went in, expecting a very disappointing and boring movie. What I eventually got was something that was funny, exciting and emotional that I didn't know would EVER happen! The biggest strength in this movie, to me, is undeniably its GREAT acting! The star of the movie, as many would say, is definitely a young Leonardo DiCaprio would unfortunately would not get the Oscar as Liam Neeson wins if for Schindler's List. Its unfortunate that this movie came out in the same year that the Winner of 7 Academy Awards, Schindler's List came out in. Johnny Depp himself is absolutely brilliant playing the family supporting brother who perfectly illustrates his character. The story never slows down. Its a fast paced drama from start to finish filled with much humor and emotion. The greatest thing about it all is that we personally care for all the characters in this film. The character I most cared about in this film was not Arnie or Gilbert, it was their obese mother, Bonnie. I found her the character I could feel for the most, imagining if the same had actually happened to my mother, how I would feel. Something I also love in this film is that despite a lot of humorous moments, the movie NEVER fails to fall out of its tone. The whole way through we care about these characters and find it so emotional when things to do eventually go wrong. The ending of the film was so powerful that if this film were to be brought back into cinemas, the final scene alone is worth the price of admission. For any who have not checked out this film, it certainly is a classical, underrated movie that is sure to leave you in tears for a good 120 minutes!

    You know there are a lot of movies to watch. But one Night I stumbled upon this DVD in my friends collection. This movie is quite personal to me. I know what it means to stick around for the family, and how trapped you are, as the eldest son. I like the way in which the movie is set, a small lonely country town, far away from the urban fuzz. A mother who has let herself go, and her two elder kids who work hard to make the ends meet, a challenged 3rd, and a 16old last girl. Elder son has to work for the bread, he is actually shown as if he is replacing his deceased father, but when he looks for his future calling(a girl) he is facing a dilemma whether to just quit or to stick around. I just like the acting, DiCaprio is a prodigy, such a great performance at such an young age. And Johnny Depp has proved it time and again that he can do it in his way, Great. I suggest, you pull your brother, your sister and your parents in, and give this movie its time.

After his father committed suicide some time earlier his mother fell into a state of depression and became morbidly obese; now she doesn't even leave the house and his younger brother Arnie is mentally disabled. It is up to Gilbert and his to sisters to look after there mother and Arnie. Gilbert acts as friend and protector to his brother; it isn't easy though as he is almost eighteen but has the mind of a young child... when a child in the body of an eighteen year old decides to be naughty it can be difficult for those around him. Arnie loves climbing; he spends much of his time up various trees, he also loves climbing the town's water tower; he finds it exciting but it is obviously very dangerous. Not much happens in Endora; in fact so little happens that watching the procession of holiday makers' trailers each year is one of the things Arnie looks forward to; this year one of them will have quite of an effect on them; Becky and her mother are travelling through when their car breaks down; it will take a week or so to get the part they need and in that time Becky will have quite an effect on Gilbert. If you are looking for action and excitement or a constant stream of laughs then this isn't the film for you; however if you want a gentle story with characters who seem real, with moments of comedy, romance and tragedy then this might be just the film you are looking for. The film has a melancholy feel; Endora feels like a town that time passed by; less and less people go to the grocery store Gilbert works at because a new out of town shopping centre has been built and Gilbert's friend Tucker sees the arrival of a new Burger Barn way of getting a job with good prospects! It isn't all downbeat though; Arnie's childlike enthusiasm for life is heart-warming even if his condition makes things difficult for his family and the arrival of Becky, a beautiful girl who will only be there a week or so clearly lightens Gilbert's mood. The cast does a fine job; Johnny Depp puts in a nicely restrained performance as Gilbert; Leonardo DiCaprio is great as Arnie; one of the best performances I've seen him give and Juliette Lewis was just right as Becky; there was something almost ethereal about her which was ideal for a character who was just passing though. Also of note is Darlene Cates who put in a fine performance as the mother despite not acting before this film. Over the course of the film expect to laugh and cry but ultimately be left with a smile on your face.

    The movie truthfully and realistically portrays how hard life is for people who are different, whether by beliefs, ideologies or simply have physical or mental disabilities, such as the two characters have one with autism and the other with obesity, it is very difficult to fit into a society when someone does not have the patterns dictated by consumer culture, accepts only people successful, intelligent, beautiful, and deeply insensitive surface, which are created by the official system. A beautiful and sad film, which brings out the evil and wicked that can become human beings with their peer. The film is an invitation to reflection and a warning about life proposes to be more sensitive, not judge anyone, loving and help to those who need it most.

    I gave this movie ten out of ten because it will touch your heart. Leonardo DiCaprio was nothing short of magic in his role, bringing the movie to a level that could never be achieved without him. The storyline was heartwarming, the characters were realistic and the parts were well cast. I had a bit of a problem with some things though; like John C Reilly's character. While he is a good actor and was nice to the Grape family in the movie, he didn't really have a developed personality. He didn't have a background or character development or even a reason of why he was so nice and helpful to the Grape family. Another thing I didn't like was the ambiguity of the ending. Amy finds a job in a new town after the house burns down and Ellen moves away with her which is a happy ending for both of them but Gilbert and Arnie just go where they want to go....? You see him reconnecting with his girlfriend when she comes back to visit, but the bag he's carrying kind of implies that he doesn't have a house. I thought the ending could have been though out better, because there is no way he could take care of his brother with a life of hitch hiking and his grocery job. But don't let my review ruin the movie for you. As I said, that was implied but you don't really know how they are living. The movie also had many good parts, which I don't have room to fit all of them in and it is definitely worth seeing.

    What's Eating Gilbert Grape? is a good movie but it's not great. Since two of my all time favourite actors are in it (the amazing Johnny Depp and Leonardo Di Caprio who I didn't even know was nominated for an Oscar in this) I thought it was going to be an amazing movie. Maybe I set my expectations too high and set myself up for disappointment. Depp is really good, not as awesome as usual but he's younger and did a very good job. Di Caprio does very well and I would say awesome for his age as a mentally challenged boy. The movie is basically about Depp dealing with his family (brother Di Caprio and an extremely overweight mother who is so big Depp literally has to put support beams up in the basement and can not fit through her house's doors. I don't want to wreck the ending, it's very good, the mother is a good actress. It's one of those things where the parts are better than the movie they add up to be if that makes sense. Direction/writing I suspect could have been better. But the ending is emotional and a good way to leave off the movie.

    A movie eventually make you feel happy or cry or anything which you can explain, but I bet you, you are not gonna explain about your feelings after watching this movie. To learn about family bonding, affections, togetherness- don't forget to make it watched. Thanks Johnny Depp to perform a responsible acting. And Caprio did a superb job. I just forget that it's Caprio, not a brain damaged teenaged boy. Most important and amazing part of this movie is to being Gilbert freed. Audience must feel Gilbert not gonna be freed because of her brother. But it's not him it's his mom. I really really love this movie. And gonna watch it when I'll be feel lost.

    What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) **** (out of 4) Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) tries adjusting to his small town where the weight of the world is on his shoulders. He must try and take care of his eccentric family including his retarded brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), his obese mother (Darlene Cates) as well as try and keeps his affair with a married woman (Mary Streenburgen) quiet. After meeting a stranger (Juliette Lewis) he begins to think that he might be better served just leaving the town and his family behind. I watched this movie when it was first released and thought it was extremely good but I think it's safe to say that time has been very good to the film as its not only shaped into a classic but I think it's improved all around. I think the movie is just about as perfect as you can get in showing someone who is just at the end of everything including being fed up with their life and the burden of the expectations that are on them. This here is where the film is so special because the Gilbert character really does feel like a real person who just wants to escape but can't find a way to do it. The film was incredibly realistic and I think it manages to be rather heartbreaking along the way even though there are certainly bits of romance and comedy scattered throughout. The greatest thing going are without question the performances. DiCaprio turns in one of the greatest performances that you're ever going to see as the mentally challenged Arnie. Just the way he performs the character is something really special to watch as he's got some perfect small touches and not for a second do you ever believe you're just watching an actor do a part. The supporting cast is terrific with Lewis, Steenburgen, Cates, John C. Reilly, Crispin Glover and Kevin Tighe perfectly fitting their roles. Depp, and everyone for that matter, were overlooked due to how great DiCaprio was but I think he too gives one of the better performances of his career. Everyone's gotten so used to his over-the-top and flashy characters that it's pretty amazing to see him play the opposite. The film has so many touching and memorable scenes and the director really pulls them all together wonderfully. Classics get better over time and I think this is a perfect example of that.

    Notice that the title of this film does not end with a question mark. It is not a thriller or a mystery; it is simply a visual description of the problems affecting a family with problems. The movie follows the daily life of an unhappy young man by the name of Gilbert who is dealing with caring for an autistic younger brother and a morbidly obese mother. This is a film that I believe everyone should see because it gives you a must greater respect for obese people and for caretakers in general. The acting is top-notch with an exceptional performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as the autistic boy. When everything comes together, what you get is a sad and moving experience.

    I read in a review that everyone will connect to a character in this movie, i couldn't agree more, it truly was one the best drama films ever seen, the movie and the character's grow onto you with their dedicated performances... i never liked the mother's part in the beginning , but towards the end i found her the most beautiful to be, specially when she says " i never wanted to be this way" .... then you realize how pretty someone looks when you look in their eyes , and not just the beauty from the outside... each and every character has played a perfect part, i love how patiently johnny depp plays his role, and you can imagine how frustrated one would be in his shoes.... but the point of life is you cant give up ! you have to give it all what it takes to love your family and be non-judge mental , cause everyone has their own limitations and problems... Great work by Leonardo di caprio, to play his character so beautifully at such a young age that too...

    This film certainly suits the description of being an underrated, forgotten classic! As school is about to start soon, one of our curricular assessments is based on the film so I went in, expecting a very disappointing and boring movie. What I eventually got was something that was funny, exciting and emotional that I didn't know would EVER happen! The biggest strength in this movie, to me, is undeniably its GREAT acting! The star of the movie, as many would say, is definitely a young Leonardo DiCaprio would unfortunately would not get the Oscar as Liam Neeson wins if for Schindler's List. Its unfortunate that this movie came out in the same year that the Winner of 7 Academy Awards, Schindler's List came out in. Johnny Depp himself is absolutely brilliant playing the family supporting brother who perfectly illustrates his character. The story never slows down. Its a fast paced drama from start to finish filled with much humor and emotion. The greatest thing about it all is that we personally care for all the characters in this film. The character I most cared about in this film was not Arnie or Gilbert, it was their obese mother, Bonnie. I found her the character I could feel for the most, imagining if the same had actually happened to my mother, how I would feel. Something I also love in this film is that despite a lot of humorous moments, the movie NEVER fails to fall out of its tone. The whole way through we care about these characters and find it so emotional when things to do eventually go wrong. The ending of the film was so powerful that if this film were to be brought back into cinemas, the final scene alone is worth the price of admission. For any who have not checked out this film, it certainly is a classical, underrated movie that is sure to leave you in tears for a good 120 minutes!

    You know there are a lot of movies to watch. But one Night I stumbled upon this DVD in my friends collection. This movie is quite personal to me. I know what it means to stick around for the family, and how trapped you are, as the eldest son. I like the way in which the movie is set, a small lonely country town, far away from the urban fuzz. A mother who has let herself go, and her two elder kids who work hard to make the ends meet, a challenged 3rd, and a 16old last girl. Elder son has to work for the bread, he is actually shown as if he is replacing his deceased father, but when he looks for his future calling(a girl) he is facing a dilemma whether to just quit or to stick around. I just like the acting, DiCaprio is a prodigy, such a great performance at such an young age. And Johnny Depp has proved it time and again that he can do it in his way, Great. I suggest, you pull your brother, your sister and your parents in, and give this movie its time.

After his father committed suicide some time earlier his mother fell into a state of depression and became morbidly obese; now she doesn't even leave the house and his younger brother Arnie is mentally disabled. It is up to Gilbert and his to sisters to look after there mother and Arnie. Gilbert acts as friend and protector to his brother; it isn't easy though as he is almost eighteen but has the mind of a young child... when a child in the body of an eighteen year old decides to be naughty it can be difficult for those around him. Arnie loves climbing; he spends much of his time up various trees, he also loves climbing the town's water tower; he finds it exciting but it is obviously very dangerous. Not much happens in Endora; in fact so little happens that watching the procession of holiday makers' trailers each year is one of the things Arnie looks forward to; this year one of them will have quite of an effect on them; Becky and her mother are travelling through when their car breaks down; it will take a week or so to get the part they need and in that time Becky will have quite an effect on Gilbert. If you are looking for action and excitement or a constant stream of laughs then this isn't the film for you; however if you want a gentle story with characters who seem real, with moments of comedy, romance and tragedy then this might be just the film you are looking for. The film has a melancholy feel; Endora feels like a town that time passed by; less and less people go to the grocery store Gilbert works at because a new out of town shopping centre has been built and Gilbert's friend Tucker sees the arrival of a new Burger Barn way of getting a job with good prospects! It isn't all downbeat though; Arnie's childlike enthusiasm for life is heart-warming even if his condition makes things difficult for his family and the arrival of Becky, a beautiful girl who will only be there a week or so clearly lightens Gilbert's mood. The cast does a fine job; Johnny Depp puts in a nicely restrained performance as Gilbert; Leonardo DiCaprio is great as Arnie; one of the best performances I've seen him give and Juliette Lewis was just right as Becky; there was something almost ethereal about her which was ideal for a character who was just passing though. Also of note is Darlene Cates who put in a fine performance as the mother despite not acting before this film. Over the course of the film expect to laugh and cry but ultimately be left with a smile on your face.
