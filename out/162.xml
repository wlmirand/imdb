    This stunning picture marking the final film appearance of legendary screen legend Mr Henry Fonda is a terrific portrayal of the turbulent and distant relationship between father and his on screen and off-screen daughter Jane Fonda. Needless to say, the real star of this picture is Fonda himself playing the cranky and despondent old poop that is Norman Thayer. The whole point with this picture was moving away from the misconception that aging is something to fear in this world, but it is rather something that needs to be embraced and welcomed into one's life  including Norman. The relationship between the father and daughter of the picture is something of central significance throughout the play. Upon Jane Fonda's return in the final scenes of the movie to the idealistic image of her father bonding with her stepson in a way he never did quite did with her reinforces the idea that it is indeed never too late to reconcile the paternal bonds that had, at once, proved almost impossible to retain. What really stood out from this picture is the chemistry between the two lead roles; Hepburn and Fonda, in their Oscar-winning performances, appear to not capture the sexualized and lustful kind of chemistry but a kind that's most genuine, relatable and honest to audiences alike. The pictures traditional and authentic message resonates that we should quit the discrepancies and controversies of the past and aim to begin the path of forgiveness and reconciliation. Strangely, the weakest section of the picture was the undeveloped 'lack of bond' between Fonda's character and his daughter. The pair's scenes demonstrated a lack of raw emotion and total emptiness - odd considering the storyline appeared to showcase their real-life lack of paternal bonding in Jane's adolescent years. Nonetheless, no one can take away the simply beauty and treasure that is 1981's On Golden Pond. The picture's sweet and gentle plot focusing on an elderly man's search for a greater meaning to growing older in the form of the late Henry Fonda with his kind-hearted and sensible wife, the also late, Ms Katharine Hepburn.

    Norman Thayer Jr. (Henry Fonda) and his wife Ethel (Katharine Hepburn) are back to their cottage on the 'Golden Pond' and the unforgettable enthusiastic "Come here, Norman! Look, the loons, the loons are welcoming us back!" magically encapsulates what their whole life was about: loving each other, and spending summer "On Golden Pond", they're a part of its history and it is a part of theirs. The images of the cottage with the magnificent nature surrounding it and interacting with the light of a rising or setting sun are absolutely dazzling, and never gratuitous. Rather than giving a sort of 'postcard' feeling to the film, they illustrate a sad reality: nature is cyclical; people's lives are not. The lake has been freezing and thawing, the leaves got green, yellow, orange, fell and were back on trees, but Norman and Ethel Thayer got older. Yet Ethel enjoys life for what it is, while Norman seems to resent it. Ethel embraces life with positivity, Norman contemplates death and their daughter Chelsea still carries the frustrations of a tormented childhood. "On Golden Pond" deserves the title of being the ultimate movie about 'aging'. The protagonist's ages are seldom mentioned in movies, but maybe it's wrong. In real life, we do count the years, I just reached 30 and for me, it's big deal. Norman Thayer is 80, Ethel near 70, Chelsea's future husband (Dabney Coleman) is 45 and his son Billy Ray is 13, the film is the one that features the most lines about age, in order to establish a sort of hierarchy in attitude. The man who's 80 is allowed to act like a poop, the one who's 45 shyly asks him if he can share the same bed with his daughter, and with his 13-year old son, he displays authority. Chelsea almost commands Los Angeles, but with her father, she's a little girl again. That's life indeed, as if we all play characters within our true personality. That's what Norman does, and Coleman cleverly spots it when he finally retorts to his sarcasm by saying "you like playing that game". That's what Billy Ray does too, by acting like the young adult who doesn't want to stick with the two old guys while his father and stepmother are having a good time in Europe. But it all leads up to the same conclusion: "bullshit", a word overused by the kid and Norman thinks it's a good word. At the end, they have to compose with each other and they do it through fishing, probably the best generation-bonding activity that ever existed, and a source of great emotional, and sometimes heart-pounding moments. "On Golden Pond" handles some of the most recognizable themes of family dramas, the unsolved parental conflict that poisoned Chelsea's life and filled her heart with anger and resentment, the grouchy old man in the twilight of his life with a sarcasm that is obviously a facade to hide a deep and tragic vulnerability, and in-between, the mother who struggles to reconcile them. But the reason I enumerate all these elements is not to point out how predictable is Mark Rydell's "On Golden Pond", the adaptation of a 1979 play written by Ernest Thompson, but how great it is despite its predictability. And the reason the film succeeds is that it's true to life. And that's what elevates "On Golden Pond" into a true cinematic treasure: it IS true to life. It has a unique capability to portray the inner strength and vulnerability of people in pivotal moments of their lives. I believed in the retired professor who celebrates his 80th birthday with a bitterness I could read in his eyes. I believed his devoted wife who's the only one who perceives the generosity, the genuine humanity of the man she spends most of her life with. And I believed in the daughter who endured her father's temperament and was jealous to see how easily her father got along with a boy who was 67-year older. In one extraordinary scene, Chelsea lets a bad word slip about her father, and although we could see the slap from her mother coming, it does resonate as a poignant and realistic moment. I guess I could go on and on the writing, and the directing, and there's no doubt they serve the film for good, but in "On Golden Pond", acting is the driving force and the main reason we believe in these characters and feel for them, genuinely, immediately and deeply. Henry Fonda, Katharine Hepburn and Jane Fonda embodies the triangular relationship with such realism and authenticity, I've never felt at one moment, that they were playing characters. There's one moment where the kid Billy Ray Jr. (Doug McKeon) asks Fonda if he ever thinks about death. And the reason he does is quite simple, something in Thayer's attitude betrays, if not a fear, at least an obsession with aging, even sadder because Henry Fonda is the same age, and we know that he would die one year later. And Henry Fonda's last role would be one of his career's highlight, earning him the Oscar for Best Actor, fully deserved, as he was able to portray pathos and anger, but still pulling some comedy in it. Katharine Hepburn won for her performance as Ethel, she was perfect indeed. And when she delivered the extraordinary declaration of love, the famous "shining armor" speech, I could almost see her golden heart shining. And Jane Fonda left me speechless, she desperately needed to be her father's friend  before it's too late. And you could tell the father and the daughter some bits of their personal history. And "On Golden Pond", it has an intimate, authentic feeling that makes the story personal; we do care for these people. The film succeeds as an unconventional family, love and coming- of-age story and, I repeat myself: it's truly a cinematic treasure.

    On Golden Pond is a film directed by Mark Rydell. The movie stars Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda together with Jane Fonda, Dabney Coleman and Doug McKeon.The screenplay by Ernest Thompson was adapted from his play of the same title. An aging couple, Ethel and Norman Thayer, spends each summer at their cottage on a lake called Golden Pond. They are visited by daughter Chelsea, who is somewhat estranged from her curmudgeon of a father. Chelsea introduces them to her new fianc&eacute;, Bill, and asks the Thayers to permit Bill's young son Billy to stay with them while she and Bill have some time to themselves. The boy is annoyed by being left with elderly strangers with no friends nearby and nothing to do. He resents Norman's brusque manner at first, but eventually comes to enjoy their Golden Pond fishing adventures together. Chelsea returns, a little exasperated and envious of the fact that Norman seemingly has bonded with a stranger's child in a way he never quite did with her. On Golden Pond is a thematically rich drama exploring marriage, aging, family conflict, death and dying.Also, the team-up of Henry Fonda with his daughter Jane together with Katherine Hepburn makes watching the film rare and valuable.Finally,this movie do capture your heart.

    ... all must, as chimney sweepers, come to dust. It isn't by accident that I choose to link the greatest writer the world has ever known with one I'd never heard of prior to this movie because Ernest Thompson has adapted his own Broadway play for the screen brilliantly but even the finest screenplay ever written can only do so much without the right actors and here we have two of the all-time greats in Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda. Hepburn astounds from the very first scene when, in late middle-age she evokes with ease a girlish enthusiasm that many an actress in her thirties would be hard put to equal. Fonda is not called upon for such bravura thesping and so it's easy to believe he isn't acting at all and that, of course, is the hallmark of a great actor. As if these two central performances in a magnificent screenplay were not enough we also get, for good measure, the breathtaking scenery of Concord, New Hampshire, which may or may not remind us of Concord, Massachussetts, where a guy named Thoreau turned out another classic when he published a diary of the eighteen months or so he spent in a cabin by another pond. Rounding things off is a gentle, evocative score by Dave Grusin so all in all we're talking perfection.

    This movie is a gem of all gems! You got some of the finest actors and actresses ever to make this movie and true classic. Here, you got Katherine Hepburn whom my father ate lunch with 5 years earlier. She is one remarkable actress who happens to be one of the biggest gems of Hollywood! Then you got the Fondas: Jane and her father Henry. What more do you want? Out in New England, there's a pond that has good memories, especially to an elderly couple(Hepburn and Henry Fonda) who are trying to show a another couple(Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman) about memories on that pond. Then there's the son who happens to stay with the daughter's parents teaching him how to have a real good time on the pond. Fishing is the tool when it comes to a really ornery fish the grandfather mentions. Bonding is also the key to the movie's main point. The daughter has trouble bonding with her father, but she later knows that he is her real father. The music and the plot is all there, the title of the movie makes a whole lot of sense. And most of all, It's more precious than gold! 5 stars!

    To start off with, On Golden Pond would be a superb film whoever was in it. It is an elegy on growing old, fearing ageing, coming to terms with it, and realising that life is still there to be enjoyed no matter how old you are. It is beautifully photographed, beautifully performed by the whole cast, very touching and emotional, and often very funny indeed. Each of these elements could be expanded upon, for this is a thoughtful, entertaining piece of art and entertainment which works on many levels. But you can't simply look at this as a film. You also have to take on board that this is the only film to feature father and daughter Henry and Jane Fonda together, it was Henry's final film in a long and distinguished career (and Jane accepted, on his behalf, his Best Actor Oscar (the only Best Actor Oscar he won) for he was too ill too collect it), and Jane purchased the rights of the original stage play as a vehicle for them because she saw much in the relationship between Chelsea and Norman which parallelled the troubled relationship she had enjoyed with Henry. One imagines that she hoped that the reconciliation enjoyed by Chelsea and Norman would also be parallelled in her relationship with Henry, and it is gratifying to believe that a measure of this was achieved. These factors almost turn the piece into meta-fiction, and add a hugely touching air to an already perfect movie.

    Screen acting legends Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn appear for the first time together as an elderly married couple experiencing what could be their final summer outing together at an idyllic New England retreat. Their quiet time is interrupted by the arrival of their semi-estranged daughter Jane Fonda, her current fianc&eacute; Dabney Coleman and his sassy young son Doug McKeon. When McKeon is left behind with the old folks, he develops a bond with Henry that Jane feels resentful of upon her return. Hollywood and critics were positively atwitter over this film, which was basically a love letter from Jane to her dad Henry. Adapted from an acclaimed stage play, Jane purchased the rights specifically so her father could take the lead role and convinced legendary Hepburn to take the co-starring part. Unfortunately, the end result is mawkish, overly sentimental treacle akin to one of those gooey Hallmark cards for the over-70 crowd. Alas, there is not much drama in watching Henry and Kate meander aimlessly around the lake house and the film pads itself with endless lingering shots of the golden sunlight glinting off the wilderness settings. Fans of the legendary acting duo no doubt will be thrilled seeing their favorites together, but even the most die-hard Fonda and Hepburn fan will have to admit that there is not much here for one to sink their teeth into. Oscar really seemed to love this film, but it is hard to see precisely why. While it is great that Fonda finally got the Oscar that had proved elusive, to say that this role is not much of a stretch for him is an understatement. By contrast, the Oscar for Hepburn is much harder to fathom. She was coming into this already with an unprecedented three Best Actress Oscars, so there was no requirement to recognize her and the role of the wife, Ethel, is positively stillborn. Hepburn seems to recognize this fact and compensates by playing it to the rafters. She sputters, she gesticulates, she shoots out sauciness, she gets positively dewy-eyed when discussing her love, and, in one incredibly embarrassing and excruciating moment, she launches into an impromptu song and dance for no discernible reason. Hepburn is almost assuredly suffering from that deadliest of acting diseases - the BIG actress in an underwhelming role. Even worse, poor Jane is stuck playing a total clich&eacute; - the resentful daughter. The screenplay gives her nothing to work with and other than the opportunity to see her opposite her dad on screen, there are no rewards in this role. It is interesting to see Fonda paired romantically with Coleman, who was her diabolical boss in 9 to 5, but he also is trapped in a nothing part. Of the supporting roles, only the appealing McKeon is able to make an impression and he has rarely been glimpsed on the screen since then. The end result is inoffensive, but not exactly an edge of your seater. I would optimistically tell fans of Henry, Kate or Jane to seek them out in some of their far better films and not waste their time on this sappy travelogue, but they would not listen anyway. Some of the photography is quite lovely, but diabetics are definitely warned to brace themselves for some truly sloppy sentiment and sugar highs. And fans of great dialog will no doubt still cringe over the "Let's suck face" line, which remains as dreadful today as it was in 1981.

    The REAL Best Picture of 1981

    At the 1982 Oscar ceremony, the Best Picture prize went, quite unaccountably, to CHARIOTS OF FIRE, a British epic about runners that in my opinion was not only the weakest of the five nominees but a rather boring film that really did not belong in the winners' circle. The other three were all rather large and ambitious films in their own different ways: Louis Malle's Atlantic CITY, Spielberg's legendary RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and Warren Beatty's flawed but compelling REDS. Of these, I must give a nod to Spielberg, since it would still be a decade before he would get the recognition he deserved. But as good as RAIDERS is, my favorite film of 1981 is Mark Rydell's ON GOLDEN POND, a "little" film that was released very late in 1981 amid almost no fanfare, a surprising move considering its cast: Henry Fonda in what would be his last film, Katharine Hepburn in the last role worthy of her, and Jane Fonda as the estranged daughter. I remember that the film came to town and just stayed, becoming a sleeper that before long everyone was talking about as the best thing they'd seen in years. Henry Fonda is Norman Thayer Jr, a retired professor facing his eightieth birthday with his wife Ethel (Hepburn) at their summer cottage on the titular pond (actually a good sized lake). Soon their estranged daughter Chelsea (Jane), a divorc&eacute;e, arrives on the scene with her new boyfriend (Dabney Coleman) and his teenage son (Doug McKeon) in tow. The tension between Norman and Chelsea is almost palpable, yet it soon becomes obvious that these two have been mad at each other for so long that neither of them remembers why, despite a passing remark late in the film that seems to indicate that Chelsea felt she was a disappointment to her father just because she was a girl. Chelsea and her beau are off for a month in Europe, and she persuades her parents to take care of the boy while they're gone. Norman is a bit reluctant, but agrees. The eminent critic Roger Ebert, in his review of this film, had this to say: "Simple affection is so rare in the movies. Shyness and resentment are also seldom seen. Love is much talked-about, but how often do we really believe that the characters are in love and not simply in a pleasant state of lust and like? Fragile emotions are hard to portray in a movie, and the movies that reach for them are more daring, really, than movies that bludgeon us with things like anger and revenge, which are easy to portray." In the central section of the film, the old man and the boy uneasily move from suspicion to acceptance to friendship to something that looks very much like love. It is one of Fonda's greatest performances in a career of great work, and young McKeon is a revelation, holding his own against his two older co-stars with remarkable aplomb. Hepburn is in some ways the heart of the film. At the very beginning, when she calls her husband's attention to the sound of the loons, and he replies that he hears nothing, watch the look on her face. There are a lot of those looks. A great deal is communicated without dialogue in this film. Even the final confrontation between father and daughter is done with a minimum of talk, and I defy anyone not to shed a tear during this scene. This is THE best picture of 1981, a small picture with a big heart that will surely affect even the most hardened moviegoer.

    On Golden Pond was a lovely little film. While a tad too long and perhaps a little leisurely in the pacing, the film is beautifully shot. From the cinematography and the scenery the film is gorgeous to look at. The music is also tender and poignant, while the story is beautiful and heartwarming and the script funny, intelligent and beautifully written. The direction is wonderful too, while aside from the cinematography the acting is On Golden Pond's greatest strength. Henry Honda and Katherine Hepburn give lovely performances and are very believable together while Jane Fonda is every bit as good. All in all, lovely little film, worth seeing for the cinematography and acting. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Norman Thayer Jr. (Henry Fonda) and his wife Ethel (Katharine Hepburn) are back to their cottage on the 'Golden Pond' and the unforgettable enthusiastic "Come here, Norman! Look, the loons, the loons are welcoming us back!" magically encapsulates what their whole life was about: loving each other, and spending summer "On Golden Pond", they're a part of its history and it is a part of theirs. The images of the cottage with the magnificent nature surrounding it and interacting with the light of a rising or setting sun are absolutely dazzling, and never gratuitous. Rather than giving a sort of 'postcard' feeling to the film, they illustrate a sad reality: nature is cyclical; people's lives are not. The lake has been freezing and thawing, the leaves got green, yellow, orange, fell and were back on trees, but Norman and Ethel Thayer got older. Yet Ethel enjoys life for what it is, while Norman seems to resent it. Ethel embraces life with positivity, Norman contemplates death and their daughter Chelsea still carries the frustrations of a tormented childhood. "On Golden Pond" deserves the title of being the ultimate movie about 'aging'. The protagonist's ages are seldom mentioned in movies, but maybe it's wrong. In real life, we do count the years, I just reached 30 and for me, it's big deal.

The man who's 80 is allowed to act like a poop, the one who's 45 shyly asks him if he can share the same bed with his daughter, and with his 13-year old son, he displays authority. Chelsea almost commands Los Angeles, but with her father, she's a little girl again. That's life indeed, as if we all play characters within our true personality. That's what Norman does, and Coleman cleverly spots it when he finally retorts to his sarcasm by saying "you like playing that game". That's what Billy Ray does too, by acting like the young adult who doesn't want to stick with the two old guys while his father and stepmother are having a good time in Europe. But it all leads up to the same conclusion: "bullshit", a word overused by the kid and Norman thinks it's a good word.

And Henry Fonda's last role would be one of his career's highlight, earning him the Oscar for Best Actor, fully deserved, as he was able to portray pathos and anger, but still pulling some comedy in it. Katharine Hepburn won for her performance as Ethel, she was perfect indeed. And when she delivered the extraordinary declaration of love, the famous "shining armor" speech, I could almost see her golden heart shining. And Jane Fonda left me speechless, she desperately needed to be her father's friend  before it's too late. And you could tell the father and the daughter some bits of their personal history. And "On Golden Pond", it has an intimate, authentic feeling that makes the story personal; we do care for these people. The film succeeds as an unconventional family, love and coming- of-age story and, I repeat myself: it's truly a cinematic treasure.

    On Golden Pond is a film directed by Mark Rydell. The movie stars Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda together with Jane Fonda, Dabney Coleman and Doug McKeon.The screenplay by Ernest Thompson was adapted from his play of the same title. An aging couple, Ethel and Norman Thayer, spends each summer at their cottage on a lake called Golden Pond. They are visited by daughter Chelsea, who is somewhat estranged from her curmudgeon of a father. Chelsea introduces them to her new fianc&eacute;, Bill, and asks the Thayers to permit Bill's young son Billy to stay with them while she and Bill have some time to themselves. The boy is annoyed by being left with elderly strangers with no friends nearby and nothing to do. He resents Norman's brusque manner at first, but eventually comes to enjoy their Golden Pond fishing adventures together. Chelsea returns, a little exasperated and envious of the fact that Norman seemingly has bonded with a stranger's child in a way he never quite did with her. On Golden Pond is a thematically rich drama exploring marriage, aging, family conflict, death and dying.Also, the team-up of Henry Fonda with his daughter Jane together with Katherine Hepburn makes watching the film rare and valuable.Finally,this movie do capture your heart.

    ... all must, as chimney sweepers, come to dust. It isn't by accident that I choose to link the greatest writer the world has ever known with one I'd never heard of prior to this movie because Ernest Thompson has adapted his own Broadway play for the screen brilliantly but even the finest screenplay ever written can only do so much without the right actors and here we have two of the all-time greats in Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda. Hepburn astounds from the very first scene when, in late middle-age she evokes with ease a girlish enthusiasm that many an actress in her thirties would be hard put to equal. Fonda is not called upon for such bravura thesping and so it's easy to believe he isn't acting at all and that, of course, is the hallmark of a great actor. As if these two central performances in a magnificent screenplay were not enough we also get, for good measure, the breathtaking scenery of Concord, New Hampshire, which may or may not remind us of Concord, Massachussetts, where a guy named Thoreau turned out another classic when he published a diary of the eighteen months or so he spent in a cabin by another pond. Rounding things off is a gentle, evocative score by Dave Grusin so all in all we're talking perfection.

    Adapted from the 1979 play of the same title, 'On Golden Pond' turns out to be a memorable, beautiful film, that is wonderfully written, maturely directed & astonishingly acted. 'On Golden Pond' Synopsis: Norman Thayer, a retired professor, and Ethel who have had a summer cottage there since early in their marriage. This summer their daughter Chelsea -- whom they haven't seen for years -- feels she must be there for Norman's birthday. Ernest Thompson's Oscar-Winning Screenplay is wonderfully written. The Screenplay very, very carefully narrates this story with tenderness & patience. The Screenplay narrates this beautiful story, with the concentration it demanded. Mark Rydell's Direction is Mature & Subtle. Cinematography is smooth. Editing is good. Performance-Wise: Henry Fonda delivers an astonishing Oscar-Winning performance. Katharine Hepburn, in an also Oscar-Winning Performance, is as charming, as ever. Jane Fonda, in an Oscar-Nominated Performance, is marvelous, as always. Doug McKeon is brilliant.

    This movie is a gem of all gems! You got some of the finest actors and actresses ever to make this movie and true classic. Here, you got Katherine Hepburn whom my father ate lunch with 5 years earlier. She is one remarkable actress who happens to be one of the biggest gems of Hollywood! Then you got the Fondas: Jane and her father Henry. What more do you want? Out in New England, there's a pond that has good memories, especially to an elderly couple(Hepburn and Henry Fonda) who are trying to show a another couple(Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman) about memories on that pond. Then there's the son who happens to stay with the daughter's parents teaching him how to have a real good time on the pond. Fishing is the tool when it comes to a really ornery fish the grandfather mentions. Bonding is also the key to the movie's main point. The daughter has trouble bonding with her father, but she later knows that he is her real father. The music and the plot is all there, the title of the movie makes a whole lot of sense. And most of all, It's more precious than gold! 5 stars!

    To start off with, On Golden Pond would be a superb film whoever was in it. It is an elegy on growing old, fearing ageing, coming to terms with it, and realising that life is still there to be enjoyed no matter how old you are. It is beautifully photographed, beautifully performed by the whole cast, very touching and emotional, and often very funny indeed. Each of these elements could be expanded upon, for this is a thoughtful, entertaining piece of art and entertainment which works on many levels. But you can't simply look at this as a film. You also have to take on board that this is the only film to feature father and daughter Henry and Jane Fonda together, it was Henry's final film in a long and distinguished career (and Jane accepted, on his behalf, his Best Actor Oscar (the only Best Actor Oscar he won) for he was too ill too collect it), and Jane purchased the rights of the original stage play as a vehicle for them because she saw much in the relationship between Chelsea and Norman which parallelled the troubled relationship she had enjoyed with Henry. One imagines that she hoped that the reconciliation enjoyed by Chelsea and Norman would also be parallelled in her relationship with Henry, and it is gratifying to believe that a measure of this was achieved. These factors almost turn the piece into meta-fiction, and add a hugely touching air to an already perfect movie.

    Screen acting legends Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn appear for the first time together as an elderly married couple experiencing what could be their final summer outing together at an idyllic New England retreat. Their quiet time is interrupted by the arrival of their semi-estranged daughter Jane Fonda, her current fianc&eacute; Dabney Coleman and his sassy young son Doug McKeon. When McKeon is left behind with the old folks, he develops a bond with Henry that Jane feels resentful of upon her return. Hollywood and critics were positively atwitter over this film, which was basically a love letter from Jane to her dad Henry. Adapted from an acclaimed stage play, Jane purchased the rights specifically so her father could take the lead role and convinced legendary Hepburn to take the co-starring part. Unfortunately, the end result is mawkish, overly sentimental treacle akin to one of those gooey Hallmark cards for the over-70 crowd. Alas, there is not much drama in watching Henry and Kate meander aimlessly around the lake house and the film pads itself with endless lingering shots of the golden sunlight glinting off the wilderness settings. Fans of the legendary acting duo no doubt will be thrilled seeing their favorites together, but even the most die-hard Fonda and Hepburn fan will have to admit that there is not much here for one to sink their teeth into. Oscar really seemed to love this film, but it is hard to see precisely why. While it is great that Fonda finally got the Oscar that had proved elusive, to say that this role is not much of a stretch for him is an understatement. By contrast, the Oscar for Hepburn is much harder to fathom. She was coming into this already with an unprecedented three Best Actress Oscars, so there was no requirement to recognize her and the role of the wife, Ethel, is positively stillborn. Hepburn seems to recognize this fact and compensates by playing it to the rafters. She sputters, she gesticulates, she shoots out sauciness, she gets positively dewy-eyed when discussing her love, and, in one incredibly embarrassing and excruciating moment, she launches into an impromptu song and dance for no discernible reason. Hepburn is almost assuredly suffering from that deadliest of acting diseases - the BIG actress in an underwhelming role. Even worse, poor Jane is stuck playing a total clich&eacute; - the resentful daughter. The screenplay gives her nothing to work with and other than the opportunity to see her opposite her dad on screen, there are no rewards in this role. It is interesting to see Fonda paired romantically with Coleman, who was her diabolical boss in 9 to 5, but he also is trapped in a nothing part. Of the supporting roles, only the appealing McKeon is able to make an impression and he has rarely been glimpsed on the screen since then. The end result is inoffensive, but not exactly an edge of your seater. I would optimistically tell fans of Henry, Kate or Jane to seek them out in some of their far better films and not waste their time on this sappy travelogue, but they would not listen anyway. Some of the photography is quite lovely, but diabetics are definitely warned to brace themselves for some truly sloppy sentiment and sugar highs. And fans of great dialog will no doubt still cringe over the "Let's suck face" line, which remains as dreadful today as it was in 1981.

    The REAL Best Picture of 1981

    At the 1982 Oscar ceremony, the Best Picture prize went, quite unaccountably, to CHARIOTS OF FIRE, a British epic about runners that in my opinion was not only the weakest of the five nominees but a rather boring film that really did not belong in the winners' circle. The other three were all rather large and ambitious films in their own different ways: Louis Malle's Atlantic CITY, Spielberg's legendary RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and Warren Beatty's flawed but compelling REDS. Of these, I must give a nod to Spielberg, since it would still be a decade before he would get the recognition he deserved. But as good as RAIDERS is, my favorite film of 1981 is Mark Rydell's ON GOLDEN POND, a "little" film that was released very late in 1981 amid almost no fanfare, a surprising move considering its cast: Henry Fonda in what would be his last film, Katharine Hepburn in the last role worthy of her, and Jane Fonda as the estranged daughter. I remember that the film came to town and just stayed, becoming a sleeper that before long everyone was talking about as the best thing they'd seen in years. Henry Fonda is Norman Thayer Jr, a retired professor facing his eightieth birthday with his wife Ethel (Hepburn) at their summer cottage on the titular pond (actually a good sized lake). Soon their estranged daughter Chelsea (Jane), a divorc&eacute;e, arrives on the scene with her new boyfriend (Dabney Coleman) and his teenage son (Doug McKeon) in tow. The tension between Norman and Chelsea is almost palpable, yet it soon becomes obvious that these two have been mad at each other for so long that neither of them remembers why, despite a passing remark late in the film that seems to indicate that Chelsea felt she was a disappointment to her father just because she was a girl. Chelsea and her beau are off for a month in Europe, and she persuades her parents to take care of the boy while they're gone. Norman is a bit reluctant, but agrees. The eminent critic Roger Ebert, in his review of this film, had this to say: "Simple affection is so rare in the movies. Shyness and resentment are also seldom seen. Love is much talked-about, but how often do we really believe that the characters are in love and not simply in a pleasant state of lust and like? Fragile emotions are hard to portray in a movie, and the movies that reach for them are more daring, really, than movies that bludgeon us with things like anger and revenge, which are easy to portray." In the central section of the film, the old man and the boy uneasily move from suspicion to acceptance to friendship to something that looks very much like love. It is one of Fonda's greatest performances in a career of great work, and young McKeon is a revelation, holding his own against his two older co-stars with remarkable aplomb. Hepburn is in some ways the heart of the film. At the very beginning, when she calls her husband's attention to the sound of the loons, and he replies that he hears nothing, watch the look on her face. There are a lot of those looks. A great deal is communicated without dialogue in this film. Even the final confrontation between father and daughter is done with a minimum of talk, and I defy anyone not to shed a tear during this scene. This is THE best picture of 1981, a small picture with a big heart that will surely affect even the most hardened moviegoer.

    On Golden Pond was a lovely little film. While a tad too long and perhaps a little leisurely in the pacing, the film is beautifully shot. From the cinematography and the scenery the film is gorgeous to look at. The music is also tender and poignant, while the story is beautiful and heartwarming and the script funny, intelligent and beautifully written. The direction is wonderful too, while aside from the cinematography the acting is On Golden Pond's greatest strength. Henry Honda and Katherine Hepburn give lovely performances and are very believable together while Jane Fonda is every bit as good. All in all, lovely little film, worth seeing for the cinematography and acting. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    This stunning picture marking the final film appearance of legendary screen legend Mr Henry Fonda is a terrific portrayal of the turbulent and distant relationship between father and his on screen and off-screen daughter Jane Fonda. Needless to say, the real star of this picture is Fonda himself playing the cranky and despondent old poop that is Norman Thayer. The whole point with this picture was moving away from the misconception that aging is something to fear in this world, but it is rather something that needs to be embraced and welcomed into one's life  including Norman. The relationship between the father and daughter of the picture is something of central significance throughout the play. Upon Jane Fonda's return in the final scenes of the movie to the idealistic image of her father bonding with her stepson in a way he never did quite did with her reinforces the idea that it is indeed never too late to reconcile the paternal bonds that had, at once, proved almost impossible to retain. What really stood out from this picture is the chemistry between the two lead roles; Hepburn and Fonda, in their Oscar-winning performances, appear to not capture the sexualized and lustful kind of chemistry but a kind that's most genuine, relatable and honest to audiences alike. The pictures traditional and authentic message resonates that we should quit the discrepancies and controversies of the past and aim to begin the path of forgiveness and reconciliation. Strangely, the weakest section of the picture was the undeveloped 'lack of bond' between Fonda's character and his daughter. The pair's scenes demonstrated a lack of raw emotion and total emptiness - odd considering the storyline appeared to showcase their real-life lack of paternal bonding in Jane's adolescent years. Nonetheless, no one can take away the simply beauty and treasure that is 1981's On Golden Pond. The picture's sweet and gentle plot focusing on an elderly man's search for a greater meaning to growing older in the form of the late Henry Fonda with his kind-hearted and sensible wife, the also late, Ms Katharine Hepburn.

    Norman Thayer Jr. (Henry Fonda) and his wife Ethel (Katharine Hepburn) are back to their cottage on the 'Golden Pond' and the unforgettable enthusiastic "Come here, Norman! Look, the loons, the loons are welcoming us back!" magically encapsulates what their whole life was about: loving each other, and spending summer "On Golden Pond", they're a part of its history and it is a part of theirs. The images of the cottage with the magnificent nature surrounding it and interacting with the light of a rising or setting sun are absolutely dazzling, and never gratuitous. Rather than giving a sort of 'postcard' feeling to the film, they illustrate a sad reality: nature is cyclical; people's lives are not. The lake has been freezing and thawing, the leaves got green, yellow, orange, fell and were back on trees, but Norman and Ethel Thayer got older. Yet Ethel enjoys life for what it is, while Norman seems to resent it. Ethel embraces life with positivity, Norman contemplates death and their daughter Chelsea still carries the frustrations of a tormented childhood. "On Golden Pond" deserves the title of being the ultimate movie about 'aging'. The protagonist's ages are seldom mentioned in movies, but maybe it's wrong. In real life, we do count the years, I just reached 30 and for me, it's big deal. Norman Thayer is 80, Ethel near 70, Chelsea's future husband (Dabney Coleman) is 45 and his son Billy Ray is 13, the film is the one that features the most lines about age, in order to establish a sort of hierarchy in attitude. The man who's 80 is allowed to act like a poop, the one who's 45 shyly asks him if he can share the same bed with his daughter, and with his 13-year old son, he displays authority. Chelsea almost commands Los Angeles, but with her father, she's a little girl again. That's life indeed, as if we all play characters within our true personality. That's what Norman does, and Coleman cleverly spots it when he finally retorts to his sarcasm by saying "you like playing that game". That's what Billy Ray does too, by acting like the young adult who doesn't want to stick with the two old guys while his father and stepmother are having a good time in Europe. But it all leads up to the same conclusion: "bullshit", a word overused by the kid and Norman thinks it's a good word. At the end, they have to compose with each other and they do it through fishing, probably the best generation-bonding activity that ever existed, and a source of great emotional, and sometimes heart-pounding moments. "On Golden Pond" handles some of the most recognizable themes of family dramas, the unsolved parental conflict that poisoned Chelsea's life and filled her heart with anger and resentment, the grouchy old man in the twilight of his life with a sarcasm that is obviously a facade to hide a deep and tragic vulnerability, and in-between, the mother who struggles to reconcile them. But the reason I enumerate all these elements is not to point out how predictable is Mark Rydell's "On Golden Pond", the adaptation of a 1979 play written by Ernest Thompson, but how great it is despite its predictability. And the reason the film succeeds is that it's true to life. And that's what elevates "On Golden Pond" into a true cinematic treasure: it IS true to life. It has a unique capability to portray the inner strength and vulnerability of people in pivotal moments of their lives. I believed in the retired professor who celebrates his 80th birthday with a bitterness I could read in his eyes. I believed his devoted wife who's the only one who perceives the generosity, the genuine humanity of the man she spends most of her life with. And I believed in the daughter who endured her father's temperament and was jealous to see how easily her father got along with a boy who was 67-year older. In one extraordinary scene, Chelsea lets a bad word slip about her father, and although we could see the slap from her mother coming, it does resonate as a poignant and realistic moment. I guess I could go on and on the writing, and the directing, and there's no doubt they serve the film for good, but in "On Golden Pond", acting is the driving force and the main reason we believe in these characters and feel for them, genuinely, immediately and deeply. Henry Fonda, Katharine Hepburn and Jane Fonda embodies the triangular relationship with such realism and authenticity, I've never felt at one moment, that they were playing characters. There's one moment where the kid Billy Ray Jr. (Doug McKeon) asks Fonda if he ever thinks about death. And the reason he does is quite simple, something in Thayer's attitude betrays, if not a fear, at least an obsession with aging, even sadder because Henry Fonda is the same age, and we know that he would die one year later. And Henry Fonda's last role would be one of his career's highlight, earning him the Oscar for Best Actor, fully deserved, as he was able to portray pathos and anger, but still pulling some comedy in it. Katharine Hepburn won for her performance as Ethel, she was perfect indeed. And when she delivered the extraordinary declaration of love, the famous "shining armor" speech, I could almost see her golden heart shining. And Jane Fonda left me speechless, she desperately needed to be her father's friend  before it's too late. And you could tell the father and the daughter some bits of their personal history. And "On Golden Pond", it has an intimate, authentic feeling that makes the story personal; we do care for these people. The film succeeds as an unconventional family, love and coming- of-age story and, I repeat myself: it's truly a cinematic treasure.

    ... all must, as chimney sweepers, come to dust. It isn't by accident that I choose to link the greatest writer the world has ever known with one I'd never heard of prior to this movie because Ernest Thompson has adapted his own Broadway play for the screen brilliantly but even the finest screenplay ever written can only do so much without the right actors and here we have two of the all-time greats in Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda. Hepburn astounds from the very first scene when, in late middle-age she evokes with ease a girlish enthusiasm that many an actress in her thirties would be hard put to equal. Fonda is not called upon for such bravura thesping and so it's easy to believe he isn't acting at all and that, of course, is the hallmark of a great actor. As if these two central performances in a magnificent screenplay were not enough we also get, for good measure, the breathtaking scenery of Concord, New Hampshire, which may or may not remind us of Concord, Massachussetts, where a guy named Thoreau turned out another classic when he published a diary of the eighteen months or so he spent in a cabin by another pond.

    Screen acting legends Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn appear for the first time together as an elderly married couple experiencing what could be their final summer outing together at an idyllic New England retreat. Their quiet time is interrupted by the arrival of their semi-estranged daughter Jane Fonda, her current fianc&eacute; Dabney Coleman and his sassy young son Doug McKeon. When McKeon is left behind with the old folks, he develops a bond with Henry that Jane feels resentful of upon her return. Hollywood and critics were positively atwitter over this film, which was basically a love letter from Jane to her dad Henry. Adapted from an acclaimed stage play, Jane purchased the rights specifically so her father could take the lead role and convinced legendary Hepburn to take the co-starring part. Unfortunately, the end result is mawkish, overly sentimental treacle akin to one of those gooey Hallmark cards for the over-70 crowd. Alas, there is not much drama in watching Henry and Kate meander aimlessly around the lake house and the film pads itself with endless lingering shots of the golden sunlight glinting off the wilderness settings. Fans of the legendary acting duo no doubt will be thrilled seeing their favorites together, but even the most die-hard Fonda and Hepburn fan will have to admit that there is not much here for one to sink their teeth into. Oscar really seemed to love this film, but it is hard to see precisely why. While it is great that Fonda finally got the Oscar that had proved elusive, to say that this role is not much of a stretch for him is an understatement. By contrast, the Oscar for Hepburn is much harder to fathom. She was coming into this already with an unprecedented three Best Actress Oscars, so there was no requirement to recognize her and the role of the wife, Ethel, is positively stillborn. Hepburn seems to recognize this fact and compensates by playing it to the rafters. She sputters, she gesticulates, she shoots out sauciness, she gets positively dewy-eyed when discussing her love, and, in one incredibly embarrassing and excruciating moment, she launches into an impromptu song and dance for no discernible reason. Hepburn is almost assuredly suffering from that deadliest of acting diseases - the BIG actress in an underwhelming role. Even worse, poor Jane is stuck playing a total clich&eacute; - the resentful daughter. The screenplay gives her nothing to work with and other than the opportunity to see her opposite her dad on screen, there are no rewards in this role. It is interesting to see Fonda paired romantically with Coleman, who was her diabolical boss in 9 to 5, but he also is trapped in a nothing part. Of the supporting roles, only the appealing McKeon is able to make an impression and he has rarely been glimpsed on the screen since then. The end result is inoffensive, but not exactly an edge of your seater. I would optimistically tell fans of Henry, Kate or Jane to seek them out in some of their far better films and not waste their time on this sappy travelogue, but they would not listen anyway. Some of the photography is quite lovely, but diabetics are definitely warned to brace themselves for some truly sloppy sentiment and sugar highs. And fans of great dialog will no doubt still cringe over the "Let's suck face" line, which remains as dreadful today as it was in 1981.

    At the 1982 Oscar ceremony, the Best Picture prize went, quite unaccountably, to CHARIOTS OF FIRE, a British epic about runners that in my opinion was not only the weakest of the five nominees but a rather boring film that really did not belong in the winners' circle. The other three were all rather large and ambitious films in their own different ways: Louis Malle's Atlantic CITY, Spielberg's legendary RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and Warren Beatty's flawed but compelling REDS. Of these, I must give a nod to Spielberg, since it would still be a decade before he would get the recognition he deserved. But as good as RAIDERS is, my favorite film of 1981 is Mark Rydell's ON GOLDEN POND, a "little" film that was released very late in 1981 amid almost no fanfare, a surprising move considering its cast: Henry Fonda in what would be his last film, Katharine Hepburn in the last role worthy of her, and Jane Fonda as the estranged daughter. I remember that the film came to town and just stayed, becoming a sleeper that before long everyone was talking about as the best thing they'd seen in years. Henry Fonda is Norman Thayer Jr, a retired professor facing his eightieth birthday with his wife Ethel (Hepburn) at their summer cottage on the titular pond (actually a good sized lake). Soon their estranged daughter Chelsea (Jane), a divorc&eacute;e, arrives on the scene with her new boyfriend (Dabney Coleman) and his teenage son (Doug McKeon) in tow. The tension between Norman and Chelsea is almost palpable, yet it soon becomes obvious that these two have been mad at each other for so long that neither of them remembers why, despite a passing remark late in the film that seems to indicate that Chelsea felt she was a disappointment to her father just because she was a girl. Chelsea and her beau are off for a month in Europe, and she persuades her parents to take care of the boy while they're gone. Norman is a bit reluctant, but agrees. The eminent critic Roger Ebert, in his review of this film, had this to say: "Simple affection is so rare in the movies. Shyness and resentment are also seldom seen. Love is much talked-about, but how often do we really believe that the characters are in love and not simply in a pleasant state of lust and like? Fragile emotions are hard to portray in a movie, and the movies that reach for them are more daring, really, than movies that bludgeon us with things like anger and revenge, which are easy to portray." In the central section of the film, the old man and the boy uneasily move from suspicion to acceptance to friendship to something that looks very much like love. It is one of Fonda's greatest performances in a career of great work, and young McKeon is a revelation, holding his own against his two older co-stars with remarkable aplomb. Hepburn is in some ways the heart of the film. At the very beginning, when she calls her husband's attention to the sound of the loons, and he replies that he hears nothing, watch the look on her face. There are a lot of those looks. A great deal is communicated without dialogue in this film. Even the final confrontation between father and daughter is done with a minimum of talk, and I defy anyone not to shed a tear during this scene. This is THE best picture of 1981, a small picture with a big heart that will surely affect even the most hardened moviegoer.

    On Golden Pond was a lovely little film. While a tad too long and perhaps a little leisurely in the pacing, the film is beautifully shot. From the cinematography and the scenery the film is gorgeous to look at. The music is also tender and poignant, while the story is beautiful and heartwarming and the script funny, intelligent and beautifully written. The direction is wonderful too, while aside from the cinematography the acting is On Golden Pond's greatest strength. Henry Honda and Katherine Hepburn give lovely performances and are very believable together while Jane Fonda is every bit as good. All in all, lovely little film, worth seeing for the cinematography and acting. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    This stunning picture marking the final film appearance of legendary screen legend Mr Henry Fonda is a terrific portrayal of the turbulent and distant relationship between father and his on screen and off-screen daughter Jane Fonda. Needless to say, the real star of this picture is Fonda himself playing the cranky and despondent old poop that is Norman Thayer. The whole point with this picture was moving away from the misconception that aging is something to fear in this world, but it is rather something that needs to be embraced and welcomed into one's life  including Norman. The relationship between the father and daughter of the picture is something of central significance throughout the play. Upon Jane Fonda's return in the final scenes of the movie to the idealistic image of her father bonding with her stepson in a way he never did quite did with her reinforces the idea that it is indeed never too late to reconcile the paternal bonds that had, at once, proved almost impossible to retain. What really stood out from this picture is the chemistry between the two lead roles; Hepburn and Fonda, in their Oscar-winning performances, appear to not capture the sexualized and lustful kind of chemistry but a kind that's most genuine, relatable and honest to audiences alike. The pictures traditional and authentic message resonates that we should quit the discrepancies and controversies of the past and aim to begin the path of forgiveness and reconciliation. Strangely, the weakest section of the picture was the undeveloped 'lack of bond' between Fonda's character and his daughter. The pair's scenes demonstrated a lack of raw emotion and total emptiness - odd considering the storyline appeared to showcase their real-life lack of paternal bonding in Jane's adolescent years. Nonetheless, no one can take away the simply beauty and treasure that is 1981's On Golden Pond. The picture's sweet and gentle plot focusing on an elderly man's search for a greater meaning to growing older in the form of the late Henry Fonda with his kind-hearted and sensible wife, the also late, Ms Katharine Hepburn.

    Norman Thayer Jr. (Henry Fonda) and his wife Ethel (Katharine Hepburn) are back to their cottage on the 'Golden Pond' and the unforgettable enthusiastic "Come here, Norman! Look, the loons, the loons are welcoming us back!" magically encapsulates what their whole life was about: loving each other, and spending summer "On Golden Pond", they're a part of its history and it is a part of theirs. The images of the cottage with the magnificent nature surrounding it and interacting with the light of a rising or setting sun are absolutely dazzling, and never gratuitous. Rather than giving a sort of 'postcard' feeling to the film, they illustrate a sad reality: nature is cyclical; people's lives are not. The lake has been freezing and thawing, the leaves got green, yellow, orange, fell and were back on trees, but Norman and Ethel Thayer got older. Yet Ethel enjoys life for what it is, while Norman seems to resent it. Ethel embraces life with positivity, Norman contemplates death and their daughter Chelsea still carries the frustrations of a tormented childhood. "On Golden Pond" deserves the title of being the ultimate movie about 'aging'. The protagonist's ages are seldom mentioned in movies, but maybe it's wrong. In real life, we do count the years, I just reached 30 and for me, it's big deal. Norman Thayer is 80, Ethel near 70, Chelsea's future husband (Dabney Coleman) is 45 and his son Billy Ray is 13, the film is the one that features the most lines about age, in order to establish a sort of hierarchy in attitude. The man who's 80 is allowed to act like a poop, the one who's 45 shyly asks him if he can share the same bed with his daughter, and with his 13-year old son, he displays authority. Chelsea almost commands Los Angeles, but with her father, she's a little girl again. That's life indeed, as if we all play characters within our true personality. That's what Norman does, and Coleman cleverly spots it when he finally retorts to his sarcasm by saying "you like playing that game". That's what Billy Ray does too, by acting like the young adult who doesn't want to stick with the two old guys while his father and stepmother are having a good time in Europe. But it all leads up to the same conclusion: "bullshit", a word overused by the kid and Norman thinks it's a good word. At the end, they have to compose with each other and they do it through fishing, probably the best generation-bonding activity that ever existed, and a source of great emotional, and sometimes heart-pounding moments. "On Golden Pond" handles some of the most recognizable themes of family dramas, the unsolved parental conflict that poisoned Chelsea's life and filled her heart with anger and resentment, the grouchy old man in the twilight of his life with a sarcasm that is obviously a facade to hide a deep and tragic vulnerability, and in-between, the mother who struggles to reconcile them. But the reason I enumerate all these elements is not to point out how predictable is Mark Rydell's "On Golden Pond", the adaptation of a 1979 play written by Ernest Thompson, but how great it is despite its predictability. And the reason the film succeeds is that it's true to life. And that's what elevates "On Golden Pond" into a true cinematic treasure: it IS true to life. It has a unique capability to portray the inner strength and vulnerability of people in pivotal moments of their lives. I believed in the retired professor who celebrates his 80th birthday with a bitterness I could read in his eyes. I believed his devoted wife who's the only one who perceives the generosity, the genuine humanity of the man she spends most of her life with. And I believed in the daughter who endured her father's temperament and was jealous to see how easily her father got along with a boy who was 67-year older. In one extraordinary scene, Chelsea lets a bad word slip about her father, and although we could see the slap from her mother coming, it does resonate as a poignant and realistic moment. I guess I could go on and on the writing, and the directing, and there's no doubt they serve the film for good, but in "On Golden Pond", acting is the driving force and the main reason we believe in these characters and feel for them, genuinely, immediately and deeply. Henry Fonda, Katharine Hepburn and Jane Fonda embodies the triangular relationship with such realism and authenticity, I've never felt at one moment, that they were playing characters. There's one moment where the kid Billy Ray Jr. (Doug McKeon) asks Fonda if he ever thinks about death. And the reason he does is quite simple, something in Thayer's attitude betrays, if not a fear, at least an obsession with aging, even sadder because Henry Fonda is the same age, and we know that he would die one year later. And Henry Fonda's last role would be one of his career's highlight, earning him the Oscar for Best Actor, fully deserved, as he was able to portray pathos and anger, but still pulling some comedy in it. Katharine Hepburn won for her performance as Ethel, she was perfect indeed. And when she delivered the extraordinary declaration of love, the famous "shining armor" speech, I could almost see her golden heart shining. And Jane Fonda left me speechless, she desperately needed to be her father's friend  before it's too late. And you could tell the father and the daughter some bits of their personal history. And "On Golden Pond", it has an intimate, authentic feeling that makes the story personal; we do care for these people. The film succeeds as an unconventional family, love and coming- of-age story and, I repeat myself: it's truly a cinematic treasure.

    On Golden Pond is a film directed by Mark Rydell. The movie stars Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda together with Jane Fonda, Dabney Coleman and Doug McKeon.The screenplay by Ernest Thompson was adapted from his play of the same title. An aging couple, Ethel and Norman Thayer, spends each summer at their cottage on a lake called Golden Pond. They are visited by daughter Chelsea, who is somewhat estranged from her curmudgeon of a father. Chelsea introduces them to her new fianc&eacute;, Bill, and asks the Thayers to permit Bill's young son Billy to stay with them while she and Bill have some time to themselves. The boy is annoyed by being left with elderly strangers with no friends nearby and nothing to do. He resents Norman's brusque manner at first, but eventually comes to enjoy their Golden Pond fishing adventures together. Chelsea returns, a little exasperated and envious of the fact that Norman seemingly has bonded with a stranger's child in a way he never quite did with her. On Golden Pond is a thematically rich drama exploring marriage, aging, family conflict, death and dying.Also, the team-up of Henry Fonda with his daughter Jane together with Katherine Hepburn makes watching the film rare and valuable.Finally,this movie do capture your heart.

    ... all must, as chimney sweepers, come to dust. It isn't by accident that I choose to link the greatest writer the world has ever known with one I'd never heard of prior to this movie because Ernest Thompson has adapted his own Broadway play for the screen brilliantly but even the finest screenplay ever written can only do so much without the right actors and here we have two of the all-time greats in Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda. Hepburn astounds from the very first scene when, in late middle-age she evokes with ease a girlish enthusiasm that many an actress in her thirties would be hard put to equal. Fonda is not called upon for such bravura thesping and so it's easy to believe he isn't acting at all and that, of course, is the hallmark of a great actor. As if these two central performances in a magnificent screenplay were not enough we also get, for good measure, the breathtaking scenery of Concord, New Hampshire, which may or may not remind us of Concord, Massachussetts, where a guy named Thoreau turned out another classic when he published a diary of the eighteen months or so he spent in a cabin by another pond. Rounding things off is a gentle, evocative score by Dave Grusin so all in all we're talking perfection.

    Adapted from the 1979 play of the same title, 'On Golden Pond' turns out to be a memorable, beautiful film, that is wonderfully written, maturely directed & astonishingly acted. 'On Golden Pond' Synopsis: Norman Thayer, a retired professor, and Ethel who have had a summer cottage there since early in their marriage. This summer their daughter Chelsea -- whom they haven't seen for years -- feels she must be there for Norman's birthday. Ernest Thompson's Oscar-Winning Screenplay is wonderfully written. The Screenplay very, very carefully narrates this story with tenderness & patience. The Screenplay narrates this beautiful story, with the concentration it demanded. Mark Rydell's Direction is Mature & Subtle. Cinematography is smooth. Editing is good. Performance-Wise: Henry Fonda delivers an astonishing Oscar-Winning performance. Katharine Hepburn, in an also Oscar-Winning Performance, is as charming, as ever. Jane Fonda, in an Oscar-Nominated Performance, is marvelous, as always. Doug McKeon is brilliant. On the whole, 'On Golden Pond' is a Winner All The Way. Two Thumbs Up!

    This movie is a gem of all gems! You got some of the finest actors and actresses ever to make this movie and true classic. Here, you got Katherine Hepburn whom my father ate lunch with 5 years earlier. She is one remarkable actress who happens to be one of the biggest gems of Hollywood! Then you got the Fondas: Jane and her father Henry. What more do you want? Out in New England, there's a pond that has good memories, especially to an elderly couple(Hepburn and Henry Fonda) who are trying to show a another couple(Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman) about memories on that pond. Then there's the son who happens to stay with the daughter's parents teaching him how to have a real good time on the pond. Fishing is the tool when it comes to a really ornery fish the grandfather mentions. Bonding is also the key to the movie's main point. The daughter has trouble bonding with her father, but she later knows that he is her real father. The music and the plot is all there, the title of the movie makes a whole lot of sense. And most of all, It's more precious than gold! 5 stars!

    To start off with, On Golden Pond would be a superb film whoever was in it. It is an elegy on growing old, fearing ageing, coming to terms with it, and realising that life is still there to be enjoyed no matter how old you are. It is beautifully photographed, beautifully performed by the whole cast, very touching and emotional, and often very funny indeed. Each of these elements could be expanded upon, for this is a thoughtful, entertaining piece of art and entertainment which works on many levels. But you can't simply look at this as a film. You also have to take on board that this is the only film to feature father and daughter Henry and Jane Fonda together, it was Henry's final film in a long and distinguished career (and Jane accepted, on his behalf, his Best Actor Oscar (the only Best Actor Oscar he won) for he was too ill too collect it), and Jane purchased the rights of the original stage play as a vehicle for them because she saw much in the relationship between Chelsea and Norman which parallelled the troubled relationship she had enjoyed with Henry. One imagines that she hoped that the reconciliation enjoyed by Chelsea and Norman would also be parallelled in her relationship with Henry, and it is gratifying to believe that a measure of this was achieved. These factors almost turn the piece into meta-fiction, and add a hugely touching air to an already perfect movie.

    Screen acting legends Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn appear for the first time together as an elderly married couple experiencing what could be their final summer outing together at an idyllic New England retreat. Their quiet time is interrupted by the arrival of their semi-estranged daughter Jane Fonda, her current fianc&eacute; Dabney Coleman and his sassy young son Doug McKeon.

Needless to say, the real star of this picture is Fonda himself playing the cranky and despondent old poop that is Norman Thayer. The whole point with this picture was moving away from the misconception that aging is something to fear in this world, but it is rather something that needs to be embraced and welcomed into one's life  including Norman. The relationship between the father and daughter of the picture is something of central significance throughout the play.

The pair's scenes demonstrated a lack of raw emotion and total emptiness - odd considering the storyline appeared to showcase their real-life lack of paternal bonding in Jane's adolescent years. Nonetheless, no one can take away the simply beauty and treasure that is 1981's On Golden Pond. The picture's sweet and gentle plot focusing on an elderly man's search for a greater meaning to growing older in the form of the late Henry Fonda with his kind-hearted and sensible wife, the also late, Ms Katharine Hepburn.

    Norman Thayer Jr. (Henry Fonda) and his wife Ethel (Katharine Hepburn) are back to their cottage on the 'Golden Pond' and the unforgettable enthusiastic "Come here, Norman! Look, the loons, the loons are welcoming us back!" magically encapsulates what their whole life was about: loving each other, and spending summer "On Golden Pond", they're a part of its history and it is a part of theirs. The images of the cottage with the magnificent nature surrounding it and interacting with the light of a rising or setting sun are absolutely dazzling, and never gratuitous. Rather than giving a sort of 'postcard' feeling to the film, they illustrate a sad reality: nature is cyclical; people's lives are not. The lake has been freezing and thawing, the leaves got green, yellow, orange, fell and were back on trees, but Norman and Ethel Thayer got older. Yet Ethel enjoys life for what it is, while Norman seems to resent it. Ethel embraces life with positivity, Norman contemplates death and their daughter Chelsea still carries the frustrations of a tormented childhood. "On Golden Pond" deserves the title of being the ultimate movie about 'aging'. The protagonist's ages are seldom mentioned in movies, but maybe it's wrong. In real life, we do count the years, I just reached 30 and for me, it's big deal. Norman Thayer is 80, Ethel near 70, Chelsea's future husband (Dabney Coleman) is 45 and his son Billy Ray is 13, the film is the one that features the most lines about age, in order to establish a sort of hierarchy in attitude. The man who's 80 is allowed to act like a poop, the one who's 45 shyly asks him if he can share the same bed with his daughter, and with his 13-year old son, he displays authority. Chelsea almost commands Los Angeles, but with her father, she's a little girl again. That's life indeed, as if we all play characters within our true personality. That's what Norman does, and Coleman cleverly spots it when he finally retorts to his sarcasm by saying "you like playing that game". That's what Billy Ray does too, by acting like the young adult who doesn't want to stick with the two old guys while his father and stepmother are having a good time in Europe. But it all leads up to the same conclusion: "bullshit", a word overused by the kid and Norman thinks it's a good word. At the end, they have to compose with each other and they do it through fishing, probably the best generation-bonding activity that ever existed, and a source of great emotional, and sometimes heart-pounding moments. "On Golden Pond" handles some of the most recognizable themes of family dramas, the unsolved parental conflict that poisoned Chelsea's life and filled her heart with anger and resentment, the grouchy old man in the twilight of his life with a sarcasm that is obviously a facade to hide a deep and tragic vulnerability, and in-between, the mother who struggles to reconcile them. But the reason I enumerate all these elements is not to point out how predictable is Mark Rydell's "On Golden Pond", the adaptation of a 1979 play written by Ernest Thompson, but how great it is despite its predictability. And the reason the film succeeds is that it's true to life. And that's what elevates "On Golden Pond" into a true cinematic treasure: it IS true to life. It has a unique capability to portray the inner strength and vulnerability of people in pivotal moments of their lives. I believed in the retired professor who celebrates his 80th birthday with a bitterness I could read in his eyes. I believed his devoted wife who's the only one who perceives the generosity, the genuine humanity of the man she spends most of her life with. And I believed in the daughter who endured her father's temperament and was jealous to see how easily her father got along with a boy who was 67-year older. In one extraordinary scene, Chelsea lets a bad word slip about her father, and although we could see the slap from her mother coming, it does resonate as a poignant and realistic moment. I guess I could go on and on the writing, and the directing, and there's no doubt they serve the film for good, but in "On Golden Pond", acting is the driving force and the main reason we believe in these characters and feel for them, genuinely, immediately and deeply. Henry Fonda, Katharine Hepburn and Jane Fonda embodies the triangular relationship with such realism and authenticity, I've never felt at one moment, that they were playing characters. There's one moment where the kid Billy Ray Jr. (Doug McKeon) asks Fonda if he ever thinks about death. And the reason he does is quite simple, something in Thayer's attitude betrays, if not a fear, at least an obsession with aging, even sadder because Henry Fonda is the same age, and we know that he would die one year later. And Henry Fonda's last role would be one of his career's highlight, earning him the Oscar for Best Actor, fully deserved, as he was able to portray pathos and anger, but still pulling some comedy in it. Katharine Hepburn won for her performance as Ethel, she was perfect indeed. And when she delivered the extraordinary declaration of love, the famous "shining armor" speech, I could almost see her golden heart shining. And Jane Fonda left me speechless, she desperately needed to be her father's friend  before it's too late. And you could tell the father and the daughter some bits of their personal history. And "On Golden Pond", it has an intimate, authentic feeling that makes the story personal; we do care for these people. The film succeeds as an unconventional family, love and coming- of-age story and, I repeat myself: it's truly a cinematic treasure.

    On Golden Pond is a film directed by Mark Rydell. The movie stars Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda together with Jane Fonda, Dabney Coleman and Doug McKeon.The screenplay by Ernest Thompson was adapted from his play of the same title. An aging couple, Ethel and Norman Thayer, spends each summer at their cottage on a lake called Golden Pond. They are visited by daughter Chelsea, who is somewhat estranged from her curmudgeon of a father. Chelsea introduces them to her new fianc&eacute;, Bill, and asks the Thayers to permit Bill's young son Billy to stay with them while she and Bill have some time to themselves. The boy is annoyed by being left with elderly strangers with no friends nearby and nothing to do. He resents Norman's brusque manner at first, but eventually comes to enjoy their Golden Pond fishing adventures together. Chelsea returns, a little exasperated and envious of the fact that Norman seemingly has bonded with a stranger's child in a way he never quite did with her. On Golden Pond is a thematically rich drama exploring marriage, aging, family conflict, death and dying.Also, the team-up of Henry Fonda with his daughter Jane together with Katherine Hepburn makes watching the film rare and valuable.Finally,this movie do capture your heart.

    ... all must, as chimney sweepers, come to dust. It isn't by accident that I choose to link the greatest writer the world has ever known with one I'd never heard of prior to this movie because Ernest Thompson has adapted his own Broadway play for the screen brilliantly but even the finest screenplay ever written can only do so much without the right actors and here we have two of the all-time greats in Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda. Hepburn astounds from the very first scene when, in late middle-age she evokes with ease a girlish enthusiasm that many an actress in her thirties would be hard put to equal. Fonda is not called upon for such bravura thesping and so it's easy to believe he isn't acting at all and that, of course, is the hallmark of a great actor. As if these two central performances in a magnificent screenplay were not enough we also get, for good measure, the breathtaking scenery of Concord, New Hampshire, which may or may not remind us of Concord, Massachussetts, where a guy named Thoreau turned out another classic when he published a diary of the eighteen months or so he spent in a cabin by another pond. Rounding things off is a gentle, evocative score by Dave Grusin so all in all we're talking perfection.

The Screenplay very, very carefully narrates this story with tenderness & patience. The Screenplay narrates this beautiful story, with the concentration it demanded. Mark Rydell's Direction is Mature & Subtle. Cinematography is smooth. Editing is good. Performance-Wise: Henry Fonda delivers an astonishing Oscar-Winning performance. Katharine Hepburn, in an also Oscar-Winning Performance, is as charming, as ever. Jane Fonda, in an Oscar-Nominated Performance, is marvelous, as always. Doug McKeon is brilliant.

    This movie is a gem of all gems! You got some of the finest actors and actresses ever to make this movie and true classic. Here, you got Katherine Hepburn whom my father ate lunch with 5 years earlier. She is one remarkable actress who happens to be one of the biggest gems of Hollywood! Then you got the Fondas: Jane and her father Henry. What more do you want? Out in New England, there's a pond that has good memories, especially to an elderly couple(Hepburn and Henry Fonda) who are trying to show a another couple(Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman) about memories on that pond. Then there's the son who happens to stay with the daughter's parents teaching him how to have a real good time on the pond. Fishing is the tool when it comes to a really ornery fish the grandfather mentions. Bonding is also the key to the movie's main point. The daughter has trouble bonding with her father, but she later knows that he is her real father. The music and the plot is all there, the title of the movie makes a whole lot of sense. And most of all, It's more precious than gold! 5 stars!

    To start off with, On Golden Pond would be a superb film whoever was in it. It is an elegy on growing old, fearing ageing, coming to terms with it, and realising that life is still there to be enjoyed no matter how old you are. It is beautifully photographed, beautifully performed by the whole cast, very touching and emotional, and often very funny indeed. Each of these elements could be expanded upon, for this is a thoughtful, entertaining piece of art and entertainment which works on many levels. But you can't simply look at this as a film. You also have to take on board that this is the only film to feature father and daughter Henry and Jane Fonda together, it was Henry's final film in a long and distinguished career (and Jane accepted, on his behalf, his Best Actor Oscar (the only Best Actor Oscar he won) for he was too ill too collect it), and Jane purchased the rights of the original stage play as a vehicle for them because she saw much in the relationship between Chelsea and Norman which parallelled the troubled relationship she had enjoyed with Henry. One imagines that she hoped that the reconciliation enjoyed by Chelsea and Norman would also be parallelled in her relationship with Henry, and it is gratifying to believe that a measure of this was achieved. These factors almost turn the piece into meta-fiction, and add a hugely touching air to an already perfect movie.

    Screen acting legends Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn appear for the first time together as an elderly married couple experiencing what could be their final summer outing together at an idyllic New England retreat. Their quiet time is interrupted by the arrival of their semi-estranged daughter Jane Fonda, her current fianc&eacute; Dabney Coleman and his sassy young son Doug McKeon. When McKeon is left behind with the old folks, he develops a bond with Henry that Jane feels resentful of upon her return. Hollywood and critics were positively atwitter over this film, which was basically a love letter from Jane to her dad Henry. Adapted from an acclaimed stage play, Jane purchased the rights specifically so her father could take the lead role and convinced legendary Hepburn to take the co-starring part. Unfortunately, the end result is mawkish, overly sentimental treacle akin to one of those gooey Hallmark cards for the over-70 crowd. Alas, there is not much drama in watching Henry and Kate meander aimlessly around the lake house and the film pads itself with endless lingering shots of the golden sunlight glinting off the wilderness settings. Fans of the legendary acting duo no doubt will be thrilled seeing their favorites together, but even the most die-hard Fonda and Hepburn fan will have to admit that there is not much here for one to sink their teeth into. Oscar really seemed to love this film, but it is hard to see precisely why. While it is great that Fonda finally got the Oscar that had proved elusive, to say that this role is not much of a stretch for him is an understatement. By contrast, the Oscar for Hepburn is much harder to fathom. She was coming into this already with an unprecedented three Best Actress Oscars, so there was no requirement to recognize her and the role of the wife, Ethel, is positively stillborn. Hepburn seems to recognize this fact and compensates by playing it to the rafters. She sputters, she gesticulates, she shoots out sauciness, she gets positively dewy-eyed when discussing her love, and, in one incredibly embarrassing and excruciating moment, she launches into an impromptu song and dance for no discernible reason. Hepburn is almost assuredly suffering from that deadliest of acting diseases - the BIG actress in an underwhelming role. Even worse, poor Jane is stuck playing a total clich&eacute; - the resentful daughter. The screenplay gives her nothing to work with and other than the opportunity to see her opposite her dad on screen, there are no rewards in this role. It is interesting to see Fonda paired romantically with Coleman, who was her diabolical boss in 9 to 5, but he also is trapped in a nothing part. Of the supporting roles, only the appealing McKeon is able to make an impression and he has rarely been glimpsed on the screen since then. The end result is inoffensive, but not exactly an edge of your seater. I would optimistically tell fans of Henry, Kate or Jane to seek them out in some of their far better films and not waste their time on this sappy travelogue, but they would not listen anyway. Some of the photography is quite lovely, but diabetics are definitely warned to brace themselves for some truly sloppy sentiment and sugar highs. And fans of great dialog will no doubt still cringe over the "Let's suck face" line, which remains as dreadful today as it was in 1981.

    The REAL Best Picture of 1981

    At the 1982 Oscar ceremony, the Best Picture prize went, quite unaccountably, to CHARIOTS OF FIRE, a British epic about runners that in my opinion was not only the weakest of the five nominees but a rather boring film that really did not belong in the winners' circle. The other three were all rather large and ambitious films in their own different ways: Louis Malle's Atlantic CITY, Spielberg's legendary RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and Warren Beatty's flawed but compelling REDS. Of these, I must give a nod to Spielberg, since it would still be a decade before he would get the recognition he deserved. But as good as RAIDERS is, my favorite film of 1981 is Mark Rydell's ON GOLDEN POND, a "little" film that was released very late in 1981 amid almost no fanfare, a surprising move considering its cast: Henry Fonda in what would be his last film, Katharine Hepburn in the last role worthy of her, and Jane Fonda as the estranged daughter. I remember that the film came to town and just stayed, becoming a sleeper that before long everyone was talking about as the best thing they'd seen in years. Henry Fonda is Norman Thayer Jr, a retired professor facing his eightieth birthday with his wife Ethel (Hepburn) at their summer cottage on the titular pond (actually a good sized lake). Soon their estranged daughter Chelsea (Jane), a divorc&eacute;e, arrives on the scene with her new boyfriend (Dabney Coleman) and his teenage son (Doug McKeon) in tow. The tension between Norman and Chelsea is almost palpable, yet it soon becomes obvious that these two have been mad at each other for so long that neither of them remembers why, despite a passing remark late in the film that seems to indicate that Chelsea felt she was a disappointment to her father just because she was a girl. Chelsea and her beau are off for a month in Europe, and she persuades her parents to take care of the boy while they're gone. Norman is a bit reluctant, but agrees. The eminent critic Roger Ebert, in his review of this film, had this to say: "Simple affection is so rare in the movies. Shyness and resentment are also seldom seen. Love is much talked-about, but how often do we really believe that the characters are in love and not simply in a pleasant state of lust and like? Fragile emotions are hard to portray in a movie, and the movies that reach for them are more daring, really, than movies that bludgeon us with things like anger and revenge, which are easy to portray." In the central section of the film, the old man and the boy uneasily move from suspicion to acceptance to friendship to something that looks very much like love. It is one of Fonda's greatest performances in a career of great work, and young McKeon is a revelation, holding his own against his two older co-stars with remarkable aplomb. Hepburn is in some ways the heart of the film. At the very beginning, when she calls her husband's attention to the sound of the loons, and he replies that he hears nothing, watch the look on her face. There are a lot of those looks. A great deal is communicated without dialogue in this film. Even the final confrontation between father and daughter is done with a minimum of talk, and I defy anyone not to shed a tear during this scene. This is THE best picture of 1981, a small picture with a big heart that will surely affect even the most hardened moviegoer.

    On Golden Pond was a lovely little film. While a tad too long and perhaps a little leisurely in the pacing, the film is beautifully shot. From the cinematography and the scenery the film is gorgeous to look at. The music is also tender and poignant, while the story is beautiful and heartwarming and the script funny, intelligent and beautifully written. The direction is wonderful too, while aside from the cinematography the acting is On Golden Pond's greatest strength. Henry Honda and Katherine Hepburn give lovely performances and are very believable together while Jane Fonda is every bit as good. All in all, lovely little film, worth seeing for the cinematography and acting. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    This stunning picture marking the final film appearance of legendary screen legend Mr Henry Fonda is a terrific portrayal of the turbulent and distant relationship between father and his on screen and off-screen daughter Jane Fonda. Needless to say, the real star of this picture is Fonda himself playing the cranky and despondent old poop that is Norman Thayer. The whole point with this picture was moving away from the misconception that aging is something to fear in this world, but it is rather something that needs to be embraced and welcomed into one's life  including Norman. The relationship between the father and daughter of the picture is something of central significance throughout the play. Upon Jane Fonda's return in the final scenes of the movie to the idealistic image of her father bonding with her stepson in a way he never did quite did with her reinforces the idea that it is indeed never too late to reconcile the paternal bonds that had, at once, proved almost impossible to retain. What really stood out from this picture is the chemistry between the two lead roles; Hepburn and Fonda, in their Oscar-winning performances, appear to not capture the sexualized and lustful kind of chemistry but a kind that's most genuine, relatable and honest to audiences alike. The pictures traditional and authentic message resonates that we should quit the discrepancies and controversies of the past and aim to begin the path of forgiveness and reconciliation. Strangely, the weakest section of the picture was the undeveloped 'lack of bond' between Fonda's character and his daughter. The pair's scenes demonstrated a lack of raw emotion and total emptiness - odd considering the storyline appeared to showcase their real-life lack of paternal bonding in Jane's adolescent years. Nonetheless, no one can take away the simply beauty and treasure that is 1981's On Golden Pond. The picture's sweet and gentle plot focusing on an elderly man's search for a greater meaning to growing older in the form of the late Henry Fonda with his kind-hearted and sensible wife, the also late, Ms Katharine Hepburn.

    Norman Thayer Jr. (Henry Fonda) and his wife Ethel (Katharine Hepburn) are back to their cottage on the 'Golden Pond' and the unforgettable enthusiastic "Come here, Norman! Look, the loons, the loons are welcoming us back!" magically encapsulates what their whole life was about: loving each other, and spending summer "On Golden Pond", they're a part of its history and it is a part of theirs. The images of the cottage with the magnificent nature surrounding it and interacting with the light of a rising or setting sun are absolutely dazzling, and never gratuitous. Rather than giving a sort of 'postcard' feeling to the film, they illustrate a sad reality: nature is cyclical; people's lives are not. The lake has been freezing and thawing, the leaves got green, yellow, orange, fell and were back on trees, but Norman and Ethel Thayer got older. Yet Ethel enjoys life for what it is, while Norman seems to resent it. Ethel embraces life with positivity, Norman contemplates death and their daughter Chelsea still carries the frustrations of a tormented childhood. "On Golden Pond" deserves the title of being the ultimate movie about 'aging'. The protagonist's ages are seldom mentioned in movies, but maybe it's wrong. In real life, we do count the years, I just reached 30 and for me, it's big deal. Norman Thayer is 80, Ethel near 70, Chelsea's future husband (Dabney Coleman) is 45 and his son Billy Ray is 13, the film is the one that features the most lines about age, in order to establish a sort of hierarchy in attitude. The man who's 80 is allowed to act like a poop, the one who's 45 shyly asks him if he can share the same bed with his daughter, and with his 13-year old son, he displays authority. Chelsea almost commands Los Angeles, but with her father, she's a little girl again. That's life indeed, as if we all play characters within our true personality. That's what Norman does, and Coleman cleverly spots it when he finally retorts to his sarcasm by saying "you like playing that game". That's what Billy Ray does too, by acting like the young adult who doesn't want to stick with the two old guys while his father and stepmother are having a good time in Europe. But it all leads up to the same conclusion: "bullshit", a word overused by the kid and Norman thinks it's a good word. At the end, they have to compose with each other and they do it through fishing, probably the best generation-bonding activity that ever existed, and a source of great emotional, and sometimes heart-pounding moments.

But the reason I enumerate all these elements is not to point out how predictable is Mark Rydell's "On Golden Pond", the adaptation of a 1979 play written by Ernest Thompson, but how great it is despite its predictability. And the reason the film succeeds is that it's true to life. And that's what elevates "On Golden Pond" into a true cinematic treasure: it IS true to life. It has a unique capability to portray the inner strength and vulnerability of people in pivotal moments of their lives. I believed in the retired professor who celebrates his 80th birthday with a bitterness I could read in his eyes.

And I believed in the daughter who endured her father's temperament and was jealous to see how easily her father got along with a boy who was 67-year older. In one extraordinary scene, Chelsea lets a bad word slip about her father, and although we could see the slap from her mother coming, it does resonate as a poignant and realistic moment. I guess I could go on and on the writing, and the directing, and there's no doubt they serve the film for good, but in "On Golden Pond", acting is the driving force and the main reason we believe in these characters and feel for them, genuinely, immediately and deeply.

Rounding things off is a gentle, evocative score by Dave Grusin so all in all we're talking perfection.

    Adapted from the 1979 play of the same title, 'On Golden Pond' turns out to be a memorable, beautiful film, that is wonderfully written, maturely directed & astonishingly acted. 'On Golden Pond' Synopsis: Norman Thayer, a retired professor, and Ethel who have had a summer cottage there since early in their marriage. This summer their daughter Chelsea -- whom they haven't seen for years -- feels she must be there for Norman's birthday. Ernest Thompson's Oscar-Winning Screenplay is wonderfully written. The Screenplay very, very carefully narrates this story with tenderness & patience. The Screenplay narrates this beautiful story, with the concentration it demanded. Mark Rydell's Direction is Mature & Subtle. Cinematography is smooth. Editing is good. Performance-Wise: Henry Fonda delivers an astonishing Oscar-Winning performance. Katharine Hepburn, in an also Oscar-Winning Performance, is as charming, as ever. Jane Fonda, in an Oscar-Nominated Performance, is marvelous, as always. Doug McKeon is brilliant. On the whole, 'On Golden Pond' is a Winner All The Way. Two Thumbs Up!

    This movie is a gem of all gems! You got some of the finest actors and actresses ever to make this movie and true classic. Here, you got Katherine Hepburn whom my father ate lunch with 5 years earlier. She is one remarkable actress who happens to be one of the biggest gems of Hollywood! Then you got the Fondas: Jane and her father Henry. What more do you want? Out in New England, there's a pond that has good memories, especially to an elderly couple(Hepburn and Henry Fonda) who are trying to show a another couple(Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman) about memories on that pond. Then there's the son who happens to stay with the daughter's parents teaching him how to have a real good time on the pond. Fishing is the tool when it comes to a really ornery fish the grandfather mentions. Bonding is also the key to the movie's main point. The daughter has trouble bonding with her father, but she later knows that he is her real father. The music and the plot is all there, the title of the movie makes a whole lot of sense. And most of all, It's more precious than gold! 5 stars!

    To start off with, On Golden Pond would be a superb film whoever was in it. It is an elegy on growing old, fearing ageing, coming to terms with it, and realising that life is still there to be enjoyed no matter how old you are. It is beautifully photographed, beautifully performed by the whole cast, very touching and emotional, and often very funny indeed. Each of these elements could be expanded upon, for this is a thoughtful, entertaining piece of art and entertainment which works on many levels. But you can't simply look at this as a film. You also have to take on board that this is the only film to feature father and daughter Henry and Jane Fonda together, it was Henry's final film in a long and distinguished career (and Jane accepted, on his behalf, his Best Actor Oscar (the only Best Actor Oscar he won) for he was too ill too collect it), and Jane purchased the rights of the original stage play as a vehicle for them because she saw much in the relationship between Chelsea and Norman which parallelled the troubled relationship she had enjoyed with Henry. One imagines that she hoped that the reconciliation enjoyed by Chelsea and Norman would also be parallelled in her relationship with Henry, and it is gratifying to believe that a measure of this was achieved. These factors almost turn the piece into meta-fiction, and add a hugely touching air to an already perfect movie.

    Screen acting legends Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn appear for the first time together as an elderly married couple experiencing what could be their final summer outing together at an idyllic New England retreat. Their quiet time is interrupted by the arrival of their semi-estranged daughter Jane Fonda, her current fianc&eacute; Dabney Coleman and his sassy young son Doug McKeon. When McKeon is left behind with the old folks, he develops a bond with Henry that Jane feels resentful of upon her return. Hollywood and critics were positively atwitter over this film, which was basically a love letter from Jane to her dad Henry. Adapted from an acclaimed stage play, Jane purchased the rights specifically so her father could take the lead role and convinced legendary Hepburn to take the co-starring part. Unfortunately, the end result is mawkish, overly sentimental treacle akin to one of those gooey Hallmark cards for the over-70 crowd. Alas, there is not much drama in watching Henry and Kate meander aimlessly around the lake house and the film pads itself with endless lingering shots of the golden sunlight glinting off the wilderness settings. Fans of the legendary acting duo no doubt will be thrilled seeing their favorites together, but even the most die-hard Fonda and Hepburn fan will have to admit that there is not much here for one to sink their teeth into. Oscar really seemed to love this film, but it is hard to see precisely why. While it is great that Fonda finally got the Oscar that had proved elusive, to say that this role is not much of a stretch for him is an understatement. By contrast, the Oscar for Hepburn is much harder to fathom. She was coming into this already with an unprecedented three Best Actress Oscars, so there was no requirement to recognize her and the role of the wife, Ethel, is positively stillborn. Hepburn seems to recognize this fact and compensates by playing it to the rafters. She sputters, she gesticulates, she shoots out sauciness, she gets positively dewy-eyed when discussing her love, and, in one incredibly embarrassing and excruciating moment, she launches into an impromptu song and dance for no discernible reason. Hepburn is almost assuredly suffering from that deadliest of acting diseases - the BIG actress in an underwhelming role. Even worse, poor Jane is stuck playing a total clich&eacute; - the resentful daughter. The screenplay gives her nothing to work with and other than the opportunity to see her opposite her dad on screen, there are no rewards in this role. It is interesting to see Fonda paired romantically with Coleman, who was her diabolical boss in 9 to 5, but he also is trapped in a nothing part. Of the supporting roles, only the appealing McKeon is able to make an impression and he has rarely been glimpsed on the screen since then. The end result is inoffensive, but not exactly an edge of your seater. I would optimistically tell fans of Henry, Kate or Jane to seek them out in some of their far better films and not waste their time on this sappy travelogue, but they would not listen anyway. Some of the photography is quite lovely, but diabetics are definitely warned to brace themselves for some truly sloppy sentiment and sugar highs. And fans of great dialog will no doubt still cringe over the "Let's suck face" line, which remains as dreadful today as it was in 1981.

    At the 1982 Oscar ceremony, the Best Picture prize went, quite unaccountably, to CHARIOTS OF FIRE, a British epic about runners that in my opinion was not only the weakest of the five nominees but a rather boring film that really did not belong in the winners' circle. The other three were all rather large and ambitious films in their own different ways: Louis Malle's Atlantic CITY, Spielberg's legendary RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and Warren Beatty's flawed but compelling REDS. Of these, I must give a nod to Spielberg, since it would still be a decade before he would get the recognition he deserved. But as good as RAIDERS is, my favorite film of 1981 is Mark Rydell's ON GOLDEN POND, a "little" film that was released very late in 1981 amid almost no fanfare, a surprising move considering its cast: Henry Fonda in what would be his last film, Katharine Hepburn in the last role worthy of her, and Jane Fonda as the estranged daughter. I remember that the film came to town and just stayed, becoming a sleeper that before long everyone was talking about as the best thing they'd seen in years. Henry Fonda is Norman Thayer Jr, a retired professor facing his eightieth birthday with his wife Ethel (Hepburn) at their summer cottage on the titular pond (actually a good sized lake). Soon their estranged daughter Chelsea (Jane), a divorc&eacute;e, arrives on the scene with her new boyfriend (Dabney Coleman) and his teenage son (Doug McKeon) in tow. The tension between Norman and Chelsea is almost palpable, yet it soon becomes obvious that these two have been mad at each other for so long that neither of them remembers why, despite a passing remark late in the film that seems to indicate that Chelsea felt she was a disappointment to her father just because she was a girl. Chelsea and her beau are off for a month in Europe, and she persuades her parents to take care of the boy while they're gone. Norman is a bit reluctant, but agrees. The eminent critic Roger Ebert, in his review of this film, had this to say: "Simple affection is so rare in the movies. Shyness and resentment are also seldom seen. Love is much talked-about, but how often do we really believe that the characters are in love and not simply in a pleasant state of lust and like? Fragile emotions are hard to portray in a movie, and the movies that reach for them are more daring, really, than movies that bludgeon us with things like anger and revenge, which are easy to portray." In the central section of the film, the old man and the boy uneasily move from suspicion to acceptance to friendship to something that looks very much like love. It is one of Fonda's greatest performances in a career of great work, and young McKeon is a revelation, holding his own against his two older co-stars with remarkable aplomb. Hepburn is in some ways the heart of the film. At the very beginning, when she calls her husband's attention to the sound of the loons, and he replies that he hears nothing, watch the look on her face. There are a lot of those looks. A great deal is communicated without dialogue in this film. Even the final confrontation between father and daughter is done with a minimum of talk, and I defy anyone not to shed a tear during this scene. This is THE best picture of 1981, a small picture with a big heart that will surely affect even the most hardened moviegoer.

    On Golden Pond was a lovely little film. While a tad too long and perhaps a little leisurely in the pacing, the film is beautifully shot. From the cinematography and the scenery the film is gorgeous to look at. The music is also tender and poignant, while the story is beautiful and heartwarming and the script funny, intelligent and beautifully written. The direction is wonderful too, while aside from the cinematography the acting is On Golden Pond's greatest strength. Henry Honda and Katherine Hepburn give lovely performances and are very believable together while Jane Fonda is every bit as good. All in all, lovely little film, worth seeing for the cinematography and acting. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    This stunning picture marking the final film appearance of legendary screen legend Mr Henry Fonda is a terrific portrayal of the turbulent and distant relationship between father and his on screen and off-screen daughter Jane Fonda. Needless to say, the real star of this picture is Fonda himself playing the cranky and despondent old poop that is Norman Thayer. The whole point with this picture was moving away from the misconception that aging is something to fear in this world, but it is rather something that needs to be embraced and welcomed into one's life  including Norman. The relationship between the father and daughter of the picture is something of central significance throughout the play. Upon Jane Fonda's return in the final scenes of the movie to the idealistic image of her father bonding with her stepson in a way he never did quite did with her reinforces the idea that it is indeed never too late to reconcile the paternal bonds that had, at once, proved almost impossible to retain. What really stood out from this picture is the chemistry between the two lead roles; Hepburn and Fonda, in their Oscar-winning performances, appear to not capture the sexualized and lustful kind of chemistry but a kind that's most genuine, relatable and honest to audiences alike. The pictures traditional and authentic message resonates that we should quit the discrepancies and controversies of the past and aim to begin the path of forgiveness and reconciliation. Strangely, the weakest section of the picture was the undeveloped 'lack of bond' between Fonda's character and his daughter. The pair's scenes demonstrated a lack of raw emotion and total emptiness - odd considering the storyline appeared to showcase their real-life lack of paternal bonding in Jane's adolescent years. Nonetheless, no one can take away the simply beauty and treasure that is 1981's On Golden Pond. The picture's sweet and gentle plot focusing on an elderly man's search for a greater meaning to growing older in the form of the late Henry Fonda with his kind-hearted and sensible wife, the also late, Ms Katharine Hepburn.

    Norman Thayer Jr. (Henry Fonda) and his wife Ethel (Katharine Hepburn) are back to their cottage on the 'Golden Pond' and the unforgettable enthusiastic "Come here, Norman! Look, the loons, the loons are welcoming us back!" magically encapsulates what their whole life was about: loving each other, and spending summer "On Golden Pond", they're a part of its history and it is a part of theirs. The images of the cottage with the magnificent nature surrounding it and interacting with the light of a rising or setting sun are absolutely dazzling, and never gratuitous. Rather than giving a sort of 'postcard' feeling to the film, they illustrate a sad reality: nature is cyclical; people's lives are not. The lake has been freezing and thawing, the leaves got green, yellow, orange, fell and were back on trees, but Norman and Ethel Thayer got older. Yet Ethel enjoys life for what it is, while Norman seems to resent it. Ethel embraces life with positivity, Norman contemplates death and their daughter Chelsea still carries the frustrations of a tormented childhood. "On Golden Pond" deserves the title of being the ultimate movie about 'aging'. The protagonist's ages are seldom mentioned in movies, but maybe it's wrong. In real life, we do count the years, I just reached 30 and for me, it's big deal. Norman Thayer is 80, Ethel near 70, Chelsea's future husband (Dabney Coleman) is 45 and his son Billy Ray is 13, the film is the one that features the most lines about age, in order to establish a sort of hierarchy in attitude. The man who's 80 is allowed to act like a poop, the one who's 45 shyly asks him if he can share the same bed with his daughter, and with his 13-year old son, he displays authority. Chelsea almost commands Los Angeles, but with her father, she's a little girl again. That's life indeed, as if we all play characters within our true personality. That's what Norman does, and Coleman cleverly spots it when he finally retorts to his sarcasm by saying "you like playing that game". That's what Billy Ray does too, by acting like the young adult who doesn't want to stick with the two old guys while his father and stepmother are having a good time in Europe. But it all leads up to the same conclusion: "bullshit", a word overused by the kid and Norman thinks it's a good word. At the end, they have to compose with each other and they do it through fishing, probably the best generation-bonding activity that ever existed, and a source of great emotional, and sometimes heart-pounding moments. "On Golden Pond" handles some of the most recognizable themes of family dramas, the unsolved parental conflict that poisoned Chelsea's life and filled her heart with anger and resentment, the grouchy old man in the twilight of his life with a sarcasm that is obviously a facade to hide a deep and tragic vulnerability, and in-between, the mother who struggles to reconcile them. But the reason I enumerate all these elements is not to point out how predictable is Mark Rydell's "On Golden Pond", the adaptation of a 1979 play written by Ernest Thompson, but how great it is despite its predictability. And the reason the film succeeds is that it's true to life. And that's what elevates "On Golden Pond" into a true cinematic treasure: it IS true to life. It has a unique capability to portray the inner strength and vulnerability of people in pivotal moments of their lives. I believed in the retired professor who celebrates his 80th birthday with a bitterness I could read in his eyes. I believed his devoted wife who's the only one who perceives the generosity, the genuine humanity of the man she spends most of her life with. And I believed in the daughter who endured her father's temperament and was jealous to see how easily her father got along with a boy who was 67-year older. In one extraordinary scene, Chelsea lets a bad word slip about her father, and although we could see the slap from her mother coming, it does resonate as a poignant and realistic moment. I guess I could go on and on the writing, and the directing, and there's no doubt they serve the film for good, but in "On Golden Pond", acting is the driving force and the main reason we believe in these characters and feel for them, genuinely, immediately and deeply. Henry Fonda, Katharine Hepburn and Jane Fonda embodies the triangular relationship with such realism and authenticity, I've never felt at one moment, that they were playing characters. There's one moment where the kid Billy Ray Jr. (Doug McKeon) asks Fonda if he ever thinks about death. And the reason he does is quite simple, something in Thayer's attitude betrays, if not a fear, at least an obsession with aging, even sadder because Henry Fonda is the same age, and we know that he would die one year later. And Henry Fonda's last role would be one of his career's highlight, earning him the Oscar for Best Actor, fully deserved, as he was able to portray pathos and anger, but still pulling some comedy in it. Katharine Hepburn won for her performance as Ethel, she was perfect indeed. And when she delivered the extraordinary declaration of love, the famous "shining armor" speech, I could almost see her golden heart shining. And Jane Fonda left me speechless, she desperately needed to be her father's friend  before it's too late. And you could tell the father and the daughter some bits of their personal history. And "On Golden Pond", it has an intimate, authentic feeling that makes the story personal; we do care for these people. The film succeeds as an unconventional family, love and coming- of-age story and, I repeat myself: it's truly a cinematic treasure.

    On Golden Pond is a film directed by Mark Rydell. The movie stars Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda together with Jane Fonda, Dabney Coleman and Doug McKeon.The screenplay by Ernest Thompson was adapted from his play of the same title. An aging couple, Ethel and Norman Thayer, spends each summer at their cottage on a lake called Golden Pond. They are visited by daughter Chelsea, who is somewhat estranged from her curmudgeon of a father. Chelsea introduces them to her new fianc&eacute;, Bill, and asks the Thayers to permit Bill's young son Billy to stay with them while she and Bill have some time to themselves. The boy is annoyed by being left with elderly strangers with no friends nearby and nothing to do. He resents Norman's brusque manner at first, but eventually comes to enjoy their Golden Pond fishing adventures together. Chelsea returns, a little exasperated and envious of the fact that Norman seemingly has bonded with a stranger's child in a way he never quite did with her. On Golden Pond is a thematically rich drama exploring marriage, aging, family conflict, death and dying.Also, the team-up of Henry Fonda with his daughter Jane together with Katherine Hepburn makes watching the film rare and valuable.Finally,this movie do capture your heart.

    ... all must, as chimney sweepers, come to dust. It isn't by accident that I choose to link the greatest writer the world has ever known with one I'd never heard of prior to this movie because Ernest Thompson has adapted his own Broadway play for the screen brilliantly but even the finest screenplay ever written can only do so much without the right actors and here we have two of the all-time greats in Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda. Hepburn astounds from the very first scene when, in late middle-age she evokes with ease a girlish enthusiasm that many an actress in her thirties would be hard put to equal. Fonda is not called upon for such bravura thesping and so it's easy to believe he isn't acting at all and that, of course, is the hallmark of a great actor. As if these two central performances in a magnificent screenplay were not enough we also get, for good measure, the breathtaking scenery of Concord, New Hampshire, which may or may not remind us of Concord, Massachussetts, where a guy named Thoreau turned out another classic when he published a diary of the eighteen months or so he spent in a cabin by another pond. Rounding things off is a gentle, evocative score by Dave Grusin so all in all we're talking perfection.

Of these, I must give a nod to Spielberg, since it would still be a decade before he would get the recognition he deserved. But as good as RAIDERS is, my favorite film of 1981 is Mark Rydell's ON GOLDEN POND, a "little" film that was released very late in 1981 amid almost no fanfare, a surprising move considering its cast: Henry Fonda in what would be his last film, Katharine Hepburn in the last role worthy of her, and Jane Fonda as the estranged daughter. I remember that the film came to town and just stayed, becoming a sleeper that before long everyone was talking about as the best thing they'd seen in years. Henry Fonda is Norman Thayer Jr, a retired professor facing his eightieth birthday with his wife Ethel (Hepburn) at their summer cottage on the titular pond (actually a good sized lake). Soon their estranged daughter Chelsea (Jane), a divorc&eacute;e, arrives on the scene with her new boyfriend (Dabney Coleman) and his teenage son (Doug McKeon) in tow. The tension between Norman and Chelsea is almost palpable, yet it soon becomes obvious that these two have been mad at each other for so long that neither of them remembers why, despite a passing remark late in the film that seems to indicate that Chelsea felt she was a disappointment to her father just because she was a girl. Chelsea and her beau are off for a month in Europe, and she persuades her parents to take care of the boy while they're gone. Norman is a bit reluctant, but agrees. The eminent critic Roger Ebert, in his review of this film, had this to say: "Simple affection is so rare in the movies. Shyness and resentment are also seldom seen. Love is much talked-about, but how often do we really believe that the characters are in love and not simply in a pleasant state of lust and like? Fragile emotions are hard to portray in a movie, and the movies that reach for them are more daring, really, than movies that bludgeon us with things like anger and revenge, which are easy to portray." In the central section of the film, the old man and the boy uneasily move from suspicion to acceptance to friendship to something that looks very much like love. It is one of Fonda's greatest performances in a career of great work, and young McKeon is a revelation, holding his own against his two older co-stars with remarkable aplomb. Hepburn is in some ways the heart of the film. At the very beginning, when she calls her husband's attention to the sound of the loons, and he replies that he hears nothing, watch the look on her face. There are a lot of those looks. A great deal is communicated without dialogue in this film. Even the final confrontation between father and daughter is done with a minimum of talk, and I defy anyone not to shed a tear during this scene. This is THE best picture of 1981, a small picture with a big heart that will surely affect even the most hardened moviegoer.

    On Golden Pond was a lovely little film. While a tad too long and perhaps a little leisurely in the pacing, the film is beautifully shot. From the cinematography and the scenery the film is gorgeous to look at. The music is also tender and poignant, while the story is beautiful and heartwarming and the script funny, intelligent and beautifully written. The direction is wonderful too, while aside from the cinematography the acting is On Golden Pond's greatest strength. Henry Honda and Katherine Hepburn give lovely performances and are very believable together while Jane Fonda is every bit as good. All in all, lovely little film, worth seeing for the cinematography and acting. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    This stunning picture marking the final film appearance of legendary screen legend Mr Henry Fonda is a terrific portrayal of the turbulent and distant relationship between father and his on screen and off-screen daughter Jane Fonda. Needless to say, the real star of this picture is Fonda himself playing the cranky and despondent old poop that is Norman Thayer. The whole point with this picture was moving away from the misconception that aging is something to fear in this world, but it is rather something that needs to be embraced and welcomed into one's life  including Norman. The relationship between the father and daughter of the picture is something of central significance throughout the play. Upon Jane Fonda's return in the final scenes of the movie to the idealistic image of her father bonding with her stepson in a way he never did quite did with her reinforces the idea that it is indeed never too late to reconcile the paternal bonds that had, at once, proved almost impossible to retain. What really stood out from this picture is the chemistry between the two lead roles; Hepburn and Fonda, in their Oscar-winning performances, appear to not capture the sexualized and lustful kind of chemistry but a kind that's most genuine, relatable and honest to audiences alike. The pictures traditional and authentic message resonates that we should quit the discrepancies and controversies of the past and aim to begin the path of forgiveness and reconciliation. Strangely, the weakest section of the picture was the undeveloped 'lack of bond' between Fonda's character and his daughter. The pair's scenes demonstrated a lack of raw emotion and total emptiness - odd considering the storyline appeared to showcase their real-life lack of paternal bonding in Jane's adolescent years. Nonetheless, no one can take away the simply beauty and treasure that is 1981's On Golden Pond. The picture's sweet and gentle plot focusing on an elderly man's search for a greater meaning to growing older in the form of the late Henry Fonda with his kind-hearted and sensible wife, the also late, Ms Katharine Hepburn.

    Norman Thayer Jr. (Henry Fonda) and his wife Ethel (Katharine Hepburn) are back to their cottage on the 'Golden Pond' and the unforgettable enthusiastic "Come here, Norman! Look, the loons, the loons are welcoming us back!" magically encapsulates what their whole life was about: loving each other, and spending summer "On Golden Pond", they're a part of its history and it is a part of theirs. The images of the cottage with the magnificent nature surrounding it and interacting with the light of a rising or setting sun are absolutely dazzling, and never gratuitous. Rather than giving a sort of 'postcard' feeling to the film, they illustrate a sad reality: nature is cyclical; people's lives are not. The lake has been freezing and thawing, the leaves got green, yellow, orange, fell and were back on trees, but Norman and Ethel Thayer got older. Yet Ethel enjoys life for what it is, while Norman seems to resent it. Ethel embraces life with positivity, Norman contemplates death and their daughter Chelsea still carries the frustrations of a tormented childhood. "On Golden Pond" deserves the title of being the ultimate movie about 'aging'. The protagonist's ages are seldom mentioned in movies, but maybe it's wrong. In real life, we do count the years, I just reached 30 and for me, it's big deal. Norman Thayer is 80, Ethel near 70, Chelsea's future husband (Dabney Coleman) is 45 and his son Billy Ray is 13, the film is the one that features the most lines about age, in order to establish a sort of hierarchy in attitude. The man who's 80 is allowed to act like a poop, the one who's 45 shyly asks him if he can share the same bed with his daughter, and with his 13-year old son, he displays authority. Chelsea almost commands Los Angeles, but with her father, she's a little girl again. That's life indeed, as if we all play characters within our true personality. That's what Norman does, and Coleman cleverly spots it when he finally retorts to his sarcasm by saying "you like playing that game". That's what Billy Ray does too, by acting like the young adult who doesn't want to stick with the two old guys while his father and stepmother are having a good time in Europe. But it all leads up to the same conclusion: "bullshit", a word overused by the kid and Norman thinks it's a good word. At the end, they have to compose with each other and they do it through fishing, probably the best generation-bonding activity that ever existed, and a source of great emotional, and sometimes heart-pounding moments. "On Golden Pond" handles some of the most recognizable themes of family dramas, the unsolved parental conflict that poisoned Chelsea's life and filled her heart with anger and resentment, the grouchy old man in the twilight of his life with a sarcasm that is obviously a facade to hide a deep and tragic vulnerability, and in-between, the mother who struggles to reconcile them. But the reason I enumerate all these elements is not to point out how predictable is Mark Rydell's "On Golden Pond", the adaptation of a 1979 play written by Ernest Thompson, but how great it is despite its predictability. And the reason the film succeeds is that it's true to life. And that's what elevates "On Golden Pond" into a true cinematic treasure: it IS true to life. It has a unique capability to portray the inner strength and vulnerability of people in pivotal moments of their lives. I believed in the retired professor who celebrates his 80th birthday with a bitterness I could read in his eyes. I believed his devoted wife who's the only one who perceives the generosity, the genuine humanity of the man she spends most of her life with. And I believed in the daughter who endured her father's temperament and was jealous to see how easily her father got along with a boy who was 67-year older. In one extraordinary scene, Chelsea lets a bad word slip about her father, and although we could see the slap from her mother coming, it does resonate as a poignant and realistic moment. I guess I could go on and on the writing, and the directing, and there's no doubt they serve the film for good, but in "On Golden Pond", acting is the driving force and the main reason we believe in these characters and feel for them, genuinely, immediately and deeply. Henry Fonda, Katharine Hepburn and Jane Fonda embodies the triangular relationship with such realism and authenticity, I've never felt at one moment, that they were playing characters. There's one moment where the kid Billy Ray Jr. (Doug McKeon) asks Fonda if he ever thinks about death. And the reason he does is quite simple, something in Thayer's attitude betrays, if not a fear, at least an obsession with aging, even sadder because Henry Fonda is the same age, and we know that he would die one year later. And Henry Fonda's last role would be one of his career's highlight, earning him the Oscar for Best Actor, fully deserved, as he was able to portray pathos and anger, but still pulling some comedy in it. Katharine Hepburn won for her performance as Ethel, she was perfect indeed. And when she delivered the extraordinary declaration of love, the famous "shining armor" speech, I could almost see her golden heart shining. And Jane Fonda left me speechless, she desperately needed to be her father's friend  before it's too late. And you could tell the father and the daughter some bits of their personal history. And "On Golden Pond", it has an intimate, authentic feeling that makes the story personal; we do care for these people. The film succeeds as an unconventional family, love and coming- of-age story and, I repeat myself: it's truly a cinematic treasure.

    On Golden Pond is a film directed by Mark Rydell. The movie stars Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda together with Jane Fonda, Dabney Coleman and Doug McKeon.The screenplay by Ernest Thompson was adapted from his play of the same title. An aging couple, Ethel and Norman Thayer, spends each summer at their cottage on a lake called Golden Pond. They are visited by daughter Chelsea, who is somewhat estranged from her curmudgeon of a father. Chelsea introduces them to her new fianc&eacute;, Bill, and asks the Thayers to permit Bill's young son Billy to stay with them while she and Bill have some time to themselves. The boy is annoyed by being left with elderly strangers with no friends nearby and nothing to do. He resents Norman's brusque manner at first, but eventually comes to enjoy their Golden Pond fishing adventures together. Chelsea returns, a little exasperated and envious of the fact that Norman seemingly has bonded with a stranger's child in a way he never quite did with her. On Golden Pond is a thematically rich drama exploring marriage, aging, family conflict, death and dying.Also, the team-up of Henry Fonda with his daughter Jane together with Katherine Hepburn makes watching the film rare and valuable.Finally,this movie do capture your heart.

    ... all must, as chimney sweepers, come to dust. It isn't by accident that I choose to link the greatest writer the world has ever known with one I'd never heard of prior to this movie because Ernest Thompson has adapted his own Broadway play for the screen brilliantly but even the finest screenplay ever written can only do so much without the right actors and here we have two of the all-time greats in Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda. Hepburn astounds from the very first scene when, in late middle-age she evokes with ease a girlish enthusiasm that many an actress in her thirties would be hard put to equal. Fonda is not called upon for such bravura thesping and so it's easy to believe he isn't acting at all and that, of course, is the hallmark of a great actor. As if these two central performances in a magnificent screenplay were not enough we also get, for good measure, the breathtaking scenery of Concord, New Hampshire, which may or may not remind us of Concord, Massachussetts, where a guy named Thoreau turned out another classic when he published a diary of the eighteen months or so he spent in a cabin by another pond. Rounding things off is a gentle, evocative score by Dave Grusin so all in all we're talking perfection.

'On Golden Pond' Synopsis: Norman Thayer, a retired professor, and Ethel who have had a summer cottage there since early in their marriage. This summer their daughter Chelsea -- whom they haven't seen for years -- feels she must be there for Norman's birthday. Ernest Thompson's Oscar-Winning Screenplay is wonderfully written. The Screenplay very, very carefully narrates this story with tenderness & patience. The Screenplay narrates this beautiful story, with the concentration it demanded. Mark Rydell's Direction is Mature & Subtle. Cinematography is smooth. Editing is good. Performance-Wise: Henry Fonda delivers an astonishing Oscar-Winning performance. Katharine Hepburn, in an also Oscar-Winning Performance, is as charming, as ever. Jane Fonda, in an Oscar-Nominated Performance, is marvelous, as always. Doug McKeon is brilliant. On the whole, 'On Golden Pond' is a Winner All The Way. Two Thumbs Up!

    This movie is a gem of all gems! You got some of the finest actors and actresses ever to make this movie and true classic. Here, you got Katherine Hepburn whom my father ate lunch with 5 years earlier. She is one remarkable actress who happens to be one of the biggest gems of Hollywood! Then you got the Fondas: Jane and her father Henry. What more do you want? Out in New England, there's a pond that has good memories, especially to an elderly couple(Hepburn and Henry Fonda) who are trying to show a another couple(Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman) about memories on that pond. Then there's the son who happens to stay with the daughter's parents teaching him how to have a real good time on the pond. Fishing is the tool when it comes to a really ornery fish the grandfather mentions. Bonding is also the key to the movie's main point. The daughter has trouble bonding with her father, but she later knows that he is her real father. The music and the plot is all there, the title of the movie makes a whole lot of sense. And most of all, It's more precious than gold! 5 stars!

    To start off with, On Golden Pond would be a superb film whoever was in it. It is an elegy on growing old, fearing ageing, coming to terms with it, and realising that life is still there to be enjoyed no matter how old you are. It is beautifully photographed, beautifully performed by the whole cast, very touching and emotional, and often very funny indeed. Each of these elements could be expanded upon, for this is a thoughtful, entertaining piece of art and entertainment which works on many levels. But you can't simply look at this as a film. You also have to take on board that this is the only film to feature father and daughter Henry and Jane Fonda together, it was Henry's final film in a long and distinguished career (and Jane accepted, on his behalf, his Best Actor Oscar (the only Best Actor Oscar he won) for he was too ill too collect it), and Jane purchased the rights of the original stage play as a vehicle for them because she saw much in the relationship between Chelsea and Norman which parallelled the troubled relationship she had enjoyed with Henry. One imagines that she hoped that the reconciliation enjoyed by Chelsea and Norman would also be parallelled in her relationship with Henry, and it is gratifying to believe that a measure of this was achieved. These factors almost turn the piece into meta-fiction, and add a hugely touching air to an already perfect movie.

    Screen acting legends Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn appear for the first time together as an elderly married couple experiencing what could be their final summer outing together at an idyllic New England retreat. Their quiet time is interrupted by the arrival of their semi-estranged daughter Jane Fonda, her current fianc&eacute; Dabney Coleman and his sassy young son Doug McKeon. When McKeon is left behind with the old folks, he develops a bond with Henry that Jane feels resentful of upon her return. Hollywood and critics were positively atwitter over this film, which was basically a love letter from Jane to her dad Henry. Adapted from an acclaimed stage play, Jane purchased the rights specifically so her father could take the lead role and convinced legendary Hepburn to take the co-starring part. Unfortunately, the end result is mawkish, overly sentimental treacle akin to one of those gooey Hallmark cards for the over-70 crowd. Alas, there is not much drama in watching Henry and Kate meander aimlessly around the lake house and the film pads itself with endless lingering shots of the golden sunlight glinting off the wilderness settings. Fans of the legendary acting duo no doubt will be thrilled seeing their favorites together, but even the most die-hard Fonda and Hepburn fan will have to admit that there is not much here for one to sink their teeth into. Oscar really seemed to love this film, but it is hard to see precisely why. While it is great that Fonda finally got the Oscar that had proved elusive, to say that this role is not much of a stretch for him is an understatement. By contrast, the Oscar for Hepburn is much harder to fathom. She was coming into this already with an unprecedented three Best Actress Oscars, so there was no requirement to recognize her and the role of the wife, Ethel, is positively stillborn. Hepburn seems to recognize this fact and compensates by playing it to the rafters. She sputters, she gesticulates, she shoots out sauciness, she gets positively dewy-eyed when discussing her love, and, in one incredibly embarrassing and excruciating moment, she launches into an impromptu song and dance for no discernible reason. Hepburn is almost assuredly suffering from that deadliest of acting diseases - the BIG actress in an underwhelming role. Even worse, poor Jane is stuck playing a total clich&eacute; - the resentful daughter. The screenplay gives her nothing to work with and other than the opportunity to see her opposite her dad on screen, there are no rewards in this role. It is interesting to see Fonda paired romantically with Coleman, who was her diabolical boss in 9 to 5, but he also is trapped in a nothing part. Of the supporting roles, only the appealing McKeon is able to make an impression and he has rarely been glimpsed on the screen since then. The end result is inoffensive, but not exactly an edge of your seater. I would optimistically tell fans of Henry, Kate or Jane to seek them out in some of their far better films and not waste their time on this sappy travelogue, but they would not listen anyway. Some of the photography is quite lovely, but diabetics are definitely warned to brace themselves for some truly sloppy sentiment and sugar highs. And fans of great dialog will no doubt still cringe over the "Let's suck face" line, which remains as dreadful today as it was in 1981.

    At the 1982 Oscar ceremony, the Best Picture prize went, quite unaccountably, to CHARIOTS OF FIRE, a British epic about runners that in my opinion was not only the weakest of the five nominees but a rather boring film that really did not belong in the winners' circle. The other three were all rather large and ambitious films in their own different ways: Louis Malle's Atlantic CITY, Spielberg's legendary RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and Warren Beatty's flawed but compelling REDS. Of these, I must give a nod to Spielberg, since it would still be a decade before he would get the recognition he deserved. But as good as RAIDERS is, my favorite film of 1981 is Mark Rydell's ON GOLDEN POND, a "little" film that was released very late in 1981 amid almost no fanfare, a surprising move considering its cast: Henry Fonda in what would be his last film, Katharine Hepburn in the last role worthy of her, and Jane Fonda as the estranged daughter. I remember that the film came to town and just stayed, becoming a sleeper that before long everyone was talking about as the best thing they'd seen in years. Henry Fonda is Norman Thayer Jr, a retired professor facing his eightieth birthday with his wife Ethel (Hepburn) at their summer cottage on the titular pond (actually a good sized lake). Soon their estranged daughter Chelsea (Jane), a divorc&eacute;e, arrives on the scene with her new boyfriend (Dabney Coleman) and his teenage son (Doug McKeon) in tow. The tension between Norman and Chelsea is almost palpable, yet it soon becomes obvious that these two have been mad at each other for so long that neither of them remembers why, despite a passing remark late in the film that seems to indicate that Chelsea felt she was a disappointment to her father just because she was a girl.

A great deal is communicated without dialogue in this film. Even the final confrontation between father and daughter is done with a minimum of talk, and I defy anyone not to shed a tear during this scene.

Look, the loons, the loons are welcoming us back!" magically encapsulates what their whole life was about: loving each other, and spending summer "On Golden Pond", they're a part of its history and it is a part of theirs. The images of the cottage with the magnificent nature surrounding it and interacting with the light of a rising or setting sun are absolutely dazzling, and never gratuitous. Rather than giving a sort of 'postcard' feeling to the film, they illustrate a sad reality: nature is cyclical; people's lives are not.

"On Golden Pond" handles some of the most recognizable themes of family dramas, the unsolved parental conflict that poisoned Chelsea's life and filled her heart with anger and resentment, the grouchy old man in the twilight of his life with a sarcasm that is obviously a facade to hide a deep and tragic vulnerability, and in-between, the mother who struggles to reconcile them. But the reason I enumerate all these elements is not to point out how predictable is Mark Rydell's "On Golden Pond", the adaptation of a 1979 play written by Ernest Thompson, but how great it is despite its predictability. And the reason the film succeeds is that it's true to life. And that's what elevates "On Golden Pond" into a true cinematic treasure: it IS true to life. It has a unique capability to portray the inner strength and vulnerability of people in pivotal moments of their lives. I believed in the retired professor who celebrates his 80th birthday with a bitterness I could read in his eyes. I believed his devoted wife who's the only one who perceives the generosity, the genuine humanity of the man she spends most of her life with. And I believed in the daughter who endured her father's temperament and was jealous to see how easily her father got along with a boy who was 67-year older. In one extraordinary scene, Chelsea lets a bad word slip about her father, and although we could see the slap from her mother coming, it does resonate as a poignant and realistic moment. I guess I could go on and on the writing, and the directing, and there's no doubt they serve the film for good, but in "On Golden Pond", acting is the driving force and the main reason we believe in these characters and feel for them, genuinely, immediately and deeply. Henry Fonda, Katharine Hepburn and Jane Fonda embodies the triangular relationship with such realism and authenticity, I've never felt at one moment, that they were playing characters. There's one moment where the kid Billy Ray Jr. (Doug McKeon) asks Fonda if he ever thinks about death. And the reason he does is quite simple, something in Thayer's attitude betrays, if not a fear, at least an obsession with aging, even sadder because Henry Fonda is the same age, and we know that he would die one year later. And Henry Fonda's last role would be one of his career's highlight, earning him the Oscar for Best Actor, fully deserved, as he was able to portray pathos and anger, but still pulling some comedy in it. Katharine Hepburn won for her performance as Ethel, she was perfect indeed. And when she delivered the extraordinary declaration of love, the famous "shining armor" speech, I could almost see her golden heart shining. And Jane Fonda left me speechless, she desperately needed to be her father's friend  before it's too late. And you could tell the father and the daughter some bits of their personal history. And "On Golden Pond", it has an intimate, authentic feeling that makes the story personal; we do care for these people. The film succeeds as an unconventional family, love and coming- of-age story and, I repeat myself: it's truly a cinematic treasure.

    On Golden Pond is a film directed by Mark Rydell. The movie stars Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda together with Jane Fonda, Dabney Coleman and Doug McKeon.The screenplay by Ernest Thompson was adapted from his play of the same title. An aging couple, Ethel and Norman Thayer, spends each summer at their cottage on a lake called Golden Pond. They are visited by daughter Chelsea, who is somewhat estranged from her curmudgeon of a father. Chelsea introduces them to her new fianc&eacute;, Bill, and asks the Thayers to permit Bill's young son Billy to stay with them while she and Bill have some time to themselves. The boy is annoyed by being left with elderly strangers with no friends nearby and nothing to do. He resents Norman's brusque manner at first, but eventually comes to enjoy their Golden Pond fishing adventures together. Chelsea returns, a little exasperated and envious of the fact that Norman seemingly has bonded with a stranger's child in a way he never quite did with her. On Golden Pond is a thematically rich drama exploring marriage, aging, family conflict, death and dying.Also, the team-up of Henry Fonda with his daughter Jane together with Katherine Hepburn makes watching the film rare and valuable.Finally,this movie do capture your heart.

    ... all must, as chimney sweepers, come to dust. It isn't by accident that I choose to link the greatest writer the world has ever known with one I'd never heard of prior to this movie because Ernest Thompson has adapted his own Broadway play for the screen brilliantly but even the finest screenplay ever written can only do so much without the right actors and here we have two of the all-time greats in Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda. Hepburn astounds from the very first scene when, in late middle-age she evokes with ease a girlish enthusiasm that many an actress in her thirties would be hard put to equal. Fonda is not called upon for such bravura thesping and so it's easy to believe he isn't acting at all and that, of course, is the hallmark of a great actor. As if these two central performances in a magnificent screenplay were not enough we also get, for good measure, the breathtaking scenery of Concord, New Hampshire, which may or may not remind us of Concord, Massachussetts, where a guy named Thoreau turned out another classic when he published a diary of the eighteen months or so he spent in a cabin by another pond. Rounding things off is a gentle, evocative score by Dave Grusin so all in all we're talking perfection.

    This movie is a gem of all gems! You got some of the finest actors and actresses ever to make this movie and true classic. Here, you got Katherine Hepburn whom my father ate lunch with 5 years earlier. She is one remarkable actress who happens to be one of the biggest gems of Hollywood! Then you got the Fondas: Jane and her father Henry. What more do you want? Out in New England, there's a pond that has good memories, especially to an elderly couple(Hepburn and Henry Fonda) who are trying to show a another couple(Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman) about memories on that pond. Then there's the son who happens to stay with the daughter's parents teaching him how to have a real good time on the pond. Fishing is the tool when it comes to a really ornery fish the grandfather mentions. Bonding is also the key to the movie's main point. The daughter has trouble bonding with her father, but she later knows that he is her real father. The music and the plot is all there, the title of the movie makes a whole lot of sense. And most of all, It's more precious than gold! 5 stars!

    To start off with, On Golden Pond would be a superb film whoever was in it. It is an elegy on growing old, fearing ageing, coming to terms with it, and realising that life is still there to be enjoyed no matter how old you are. It is beautifully photographed, beautifully performed by the whole cast, very touching and emotional, and often very funny indeed. Each of these elements could be expanded upon, for this is a thoughtful, entertaining piece of art and entertainment which works on many levels. But you can't simply look at this as a film. You also have to take on board that this is the only film to feature father and daughter Henry and Jane Fonda together, it was Henry's final film in a long and distinguished career (and Jane accepted, on his behalf, his Best Actor Oscar (the only Best Actor Oscar he won) for he was too ill too collect it), and Jane purchased the rights of the original stage play as a vehicle for them because she saw much in the relationship between Chelsea and Norman which parallelled the troubled relationship she had enjoyed with Henry. One imagines that she hoped that the reconciliation enjoyed by Chelsea and Norman would also be parallelled in her relationship with Henry, and it is gratifying to believe that a measure of this was achieved. These factors almost turn the piece into meta-fiction, and add a hugely touching air to an already perfect movie.

    Screen acting legends Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn appear for the first time together as an elderly married couple experiencing what could be their final summer outing together at an idyllic New England retreat. Their quiet time is interrupted by the arrival of their semi-estranged daughter Jane Fonda, her current fianc&eacute; Dabney Coleman and his sassy young son Doug McKeon. When McKeon is left behind with the old folks, he develops a bond with Henry that Jane feels resentful of upon her return. Hollywood and critics were positively atwitter over this film, which was basically a love letter from Jane to her dad Henry. Adapted from an acclaimed stage play, Jane purchased the rights specifically so her father could take the lead role and convinced legendary Hepburn to take the co-starring part. Unfortunately, the end result is mawkish, overly sentimental treacle akin to one of those gooey Hallmark cards for the over-70 crowd. Alas, there is not much drama in watching Henry and Kate meander aimlessly around the lake house and the film pads itself with endless lingering shots of the golden sunlight glinting off the wilderness settings. Fans of the legendary acting duo no doubt will be thrilled seeing their favorites together, but even the most die-hard Fonda and Hepburn fan will have to admit that there is not much here for one to sink their teeth into. Oscar really seemed to love this film, but it is hard to see precisely why. While it is great that Fonda finally got the Oscar that had proved elusive, to say that this role is not much of a stretch for him is an understatement. By contrast, the Oscar for Hepburn is much harder to fathom. She was coming into this already with an unprecedented three Best Actress Oscars, so there was no requirement to recognize her and the role of the wife, Ethel, is positively stillborn. Hepburn seems to recognize this fact and compensates by playing it to the rafters. She sputters, she gesticulates, she shoots out sauciness, she gets positively dewy-eyed when discussing her love, and, in one incredibly embarrassing and excruciating moment, she launches into an impromptu song and dance for no discernible reason. Hepburn is almost assuredly suffering from that deadliest of acting diseases - the BIG actress in an underwhelming role. Even worse, poor Jane is stuck playing a total clich&eacute; - the resentful daughter. The screenplay gives her nothing to work with and other than the opportunity to see her opposite her dad on screen, there are no rewards in this role. It is interesting to see Fonda paired romantically with Coleman, who was her diabolical boss in 9 to 5, but he also is trapped in a nothing part. Of the supporting roles, only the appealing McKeon is able to make an impression and he has rarely been glimpsed on the screen since then. The end result is inoffensive, but not exactly an edge of your seater. I would optimistically tell fans of Henry, Kate or Jane to seek them out in some of their far better films and not waste their time on this sappy travelogue, but they would not listen anyway. Some of the photography is quite lovely, but diabetics are definitely warned to brace themselves for some truly sloppy sentiment and sugar highs. And fans of great dialog will no doubt still cringe over the "Let's suck face" line, which remains as dreadful today as it was in 1981.

    The REAL Best Picture of 1981

    At the 1982 Oscar ceremony, the Best Picture prize went, quite unaccountably, to CHARIOTS OF FIRE, a British epic about runners that in my opinion was not only the weakest of the five nominees but a rather boring film that really did not belong in the winners' circle. The other three were all rather large and ambitious films in their own different ways: Louis Malle's Atlantic CITY, Spielberg's legendary RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and Warren Beatty's flawed but compelling REDS. Of these, I must give a nod to Spielberg, since it would still be a decade before he would get the recognition he deserved. But as good as RAIDERS is, my favorite film of 1981 is Mark Rydell's ON GOLDEN POND, a "little" film that was released very late in 1981 amid almost no fanfare, a surprising move considering its cast: Henry Fonda in what would be his last film, Katharine Hepburn in the last role worthy of her, and Jane Fonda as the estranged daughter. I remember that the film came to town and just stayed, becoming a sleeper that before long everyone was talking about as the best thing they'd seen in years. Henry Fonda is Norman Thayer Jr, a retired professor facing his eightieth birthday with his wife Ethel (Hepburn) at their summer cottage on the titular pond (actually a good sized lake). Soon their estranged daughter Chelsea (Jane), a divorc&eacute;e, arrives on the scene with her new boyfriend (Dabney Coleman) and his teenage son (Doug McKeon) in tow. The tension between Norman and Chelsea is almost palpable, yet it soon becomes obvious that these two have been mad at each other for so long that neither of them remembers why, despite a passing remark late in the film that seems to indicate that Chelsea felt she was a disappointment to her father just because she was a girl. Chelsea and her beau are off for a month in Europe, and she persuades her parents to take care of the boy while they're gone. Norman is a bit reluctant, but agrees. The eminent critic Roger Ebert, in his review of this film, had this to say: "Simple affection is so rare in the movies. Shyness and resentment are also seldom seen. Love is much talked-about, but how often do we really believe that the characters are in love and not simply in a pleasant state of lust and like? Fragile emotions are hard to portray in a movie, and the movies that reach for them are more daring, really, than movies that bludgeon us with things like anger and revenge, which are easy to portray." In the central section of the film, the old man and the boy uneasily move from suspicion to acceptance to friendship to something that looks very much like love. It is one of Fonda's greatest performances in a career of great work, and young McKeon is a revelation, holding his own against his two older co-stars with remarkable aplomb. Hepburn is in some ways the heart of the film. At the very beginning, when she calls her husband's attention to the sound of the loons, and he replies that he hears nothing, watch the look on her face. There are a lot of those looks. A great deal is communicated without dialogue in this film. Even the final confrontation between father and daughter is done with a minimum of talk, and I defy anyone not to shed a tear during this scene. This is THE best picture of 1981, a small picture with a big heart that will surely affect even the most hardened moviegoer.

    On Golden Pond was a lovely little film. While a tad too long and perhaps a little leisurely in the pacing, the film is beautifully shot. From the cinematography and the scenery the film is gorgeous to look at. The music is also tender and poignant, while the story is beautiful and heartwarming and the script funny, intelligent and beautifully written. The direction is wonderful too, while aside from the cinematography the acting is On Golden Pond's greatest strength. Henry Honda and Katherine Hepburn give lovely performances and are very believable together while Jane Fonda is every bit as good. All in all, lovely little film, worth seeing for the cinematography and acting. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    This stunning picture marking the final film appearance of legendary screen legend Mr Henry Fonda is a terrific portrayal of the turbulent and distant relationship between father and his on screen and off-screen daughter Jane Fonda. Needless to say, the real star of this picture is Fonda himself playing the cranky and despondent old poop that is Norman Thayer. The whole point with this picture was moving away from the misconception that aging is something to fear in this world, but it is rather something that needs to be embraced and welcomed into one's life  including Norman. The relationship between the father and daughter of the picture is something of central significance throughout the play. Upon Jane Fonda's return in the final scenes of the movie to the idealistic image of her father bonding with her stepson in a way he never did quite did with her reinforces the idea that it is indeed never too late to reconcile the paternal bonds that had, at once, proved almost impossible to retain. What really stood out from this picture is the chemistry between the two lead roles; Hepburn and Fonda, in their Oscar-winning performances, appear to not capture the sexualized and lustful kind of chemistry but a kind that's most genuine, relatable and honest to audiences alike. The pictures traditional and authentic message resonates that we should quit the discrepancies and controversies of the past and aim to begin the path of forgiveness and reconciliation. Strangely, the weakest section of the picture was the undeveloped 'lack of bond' between Fonda's character and his daughter. The pair's scenes demonstrated a lack of raw emotion and total emptiness - odd considering the storyline appeared to showcase their real-life lack of paternal bonding in Jane's adolescent years. Nonetheless, no one can take away the simply beauty and treasure that is 1981's On Golden Pond. The picture's sweet and gentle plot focusing on an elderly man's search for a greater meaning to growing older in the form of the late Henry Fonda with his kind-hearted and sensible wife, the also late, Ms Katharine Hepburn.

    Norman Thayer Jr. (Henry Fonda) and his wife Ethel (Katharine Hepburn) are back to their cottage on the 'Golden Pond' and the unforgettable enthusiastic "Come here, Norman! Look, the loons, the loons are welcoming us back!" magically encapsulates what their whole life was about: loving each other, and spending summer "On Golden Pond", they're a part of its history and it is a part of theirs. The images of the cottage with the magnificent nature surrounding it and interacting with the light of a rising or setting sun are absolutely dazzling, and never gratuitous. Rather than giving a sort of 'postcard' feeling to the film, they illustrate a sad reality: nature is cyclical; people's lives are not. The lake has been freezing and thawing, the leaves got green, yellow, orange, fell and were back on trees, but Norman and Ethel Thayer got older. Yet Ethel enjoys life for what it is, while Norman seems to resent it. Ethel embraces life with positivity, Norman contemplates death and their daughter Chelsea still carries the frustrations of a tormented childhood. "On Golden Pond" deserves the title of being the ultimate movie about 'aging'. The protagonist's ages are seldom mentioned in movies, but maybe it's wrong. In real life, we do count the years, I just reached 30 and for me, it's big deal. Norman Thayer is 80, Ethel near 70, Chelsea's future husband (Dabney Coleman) is 45 and his son Billy Ray is 13, the film is the one that features the most lines about age, in order to establish a sort of hierarchy in attitude. The man who's 80 is allowed to act like a poop, the one who's 45 shyly asks him if he can share the same bed with his daughter, and with his 13-year old son, he displays authority. Chelsea almost commands Los Angeles, but with her father, she's a little girl again. That's life indeed, as if we all play characters within our true personality. That's what Norman does, and Coleman cleverly spots it when he finally retorts to his sarcasm by saying "you like playing that game". That's what Billy Ray does too, by acting like the young adult who doesn't want to stick with the two old guys while his father and stepmother are having a good time in Europe. But it all leads up to the same conclusion: "bullshit", a word overused by the kid and Norman thinks it's a good word. At the end, they have to compose with each other and they do it through fishing, probably the best generation-bonding activity that ever existed, and a source of great emotional, and sometimes heart-pounding moments. "On Golden Pond" handles some of the most recognizable themes of family dramas, the unsolved parental conflict that poisoned Chelsea's life and filled her heart with anger and resentment, the grouchy old man in the twilight of his life with a sarcasm that is obviously a facade to hide a deep and tragic vulnerability, and in-between, the mother who struggles to reconcile them. But the reason I enumerate all these elements is not to point out how predictable is Mark Rydell's "On Golden Pond", the adaptation of a 1979 play written by Ernest Thompson, but how great it is despite its predictability. And the reason the film succeeds is that it's true to life. And that's what elevates "On Golden Pond" into a true cinematic treasure: it IS true to life. It has a unique capability to portray the inner strength and vulnerability of people in pivotal moments of their lives. I believed in the retired professor who celebrates his 80th birthday with a bitterness I could read in his eyes. I believed his devoted wife who's the only one who perceives the generosity, the genuine humanity of the man she spends most of her life with. And I believed in the daughter who endured her father's temperament and was jealous to see how easily her father got along with a boy who was 67-year older. In one extraordinary scene, Chelsea lets a bad word slip about her father, and although we could see the slap from her mother coming, it does resonate as a poignant and realistic moment. I guess I could go on and on the writing, and the directing, and there's no doubt they serve the film for good, but in "On Golden Pond", acting is the driving force and the main reason we believe in these characters and feel for them, genuinely, immediately and deeply. Henry Fonda, Katharine Hepburn and Jane Fonda embodies the triangular relationship with such realism and authenticity, I've never felt at one moment, that they were playing characters.

And the reason he does is quite simple, something in Thayer's attitude betrays, if not a fear, at least an obsession with aging, even sadder because Henry Fonda is the same age, and we know that he would die one year later. And Henry Fonda's last role would be one of his career's highlight, earning him the Oscar for Best Actor, fully deserved, as he was able to portray pathos and anger, but still pulling some comedy in it. Katharine Hepburn won for her performance as Ethel, she was perfect indeed. And when she delivered the extraordinary declaration of love, the famous "shining armor" speech, I could almost see her golden heart shining. And Jane Fonda left me speechless, she desperately needed to be her father's friend  before it's too late. And you could tell the father and the daughter some bits of their personal history. And "On Golden Pond", it has an intimate, authentic feeling that makes the story personal; we do care for these people.

    ... all must, as chimney sweepers, come to dust. It isn't by accident that I choose to link the greatest writer the world has ever known with one I'd never heard of prior to this movie because Ernest Thompson has adapted his own Broadway play for the screen brilliantly but even the finest screenplay ever written can only do so much without the right actors and here we have two of the all-time greats in Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda. Hepburn astounds from the very first scene when, in late middle-age she evokes with ease a girlish enthusiasm that many an actress in her thirties would be hard put to equal. Fonda is not called upon for such bravura thesping and so it's easy to believe he isn't acting at all and that, of course, is the hallmark of a great actor. As if these two central performances in a magnificent screenplay were not enough we also get, for good measure, the breathtaking scenery of Concord, New Hampshire, which may or may not remind us of Concord, Massachussetts, where a guy named Thoreau turned out another classic when he published a diary of the eighteen months or so he spent in a cabin by another pond.

    To start off with, On Golden Pond would be a superb film whoever was in it. It is an elegy on growing old, fearing ageing, coming to terms with it, and realising that life is still there to be enjoyed no matter how old you are. It is beautifully photographed, beautifully performed by the whole cast, very touching and emotional, and often very funny indeed. Each of these elements could be expanded upon, for this is a thoughtful, entertaining piece of art and entertainment which works on many levels. But you can't simply look at this as a film. You also have to take on board that this is the only film to feature father and daughter Henry and Jane Fonda together, it was Henry's final film in a long and distinguished career (and Jane accepted, on his behalf, his Best Actor Oscar (the only Best Actor Oscar he won) for he was too ill too collect it), and Jane purchased the rights of the original stage play as a vehicle for them because she saw much in the relationship between Chelsea and Norman which parallelled the troubled relationship she had enjoyed with Henry. One imagines that she hoped that the reconciliation enjoyed by Chelsea and Norman would also be parallelled in her relationship with Henry, and it is gratifying to believe that a measure of this was achieved. These factors almost turn the piece into meta-fiction, and add a hugely touching air to an already perfect movie.

    Screen acting legends Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn appear for the first time together as an elderly married couple experiencing what could be their final summer outing together at an idyllic New England retreat. Their quiet time is interrupted by the arrival of their semi-estranged daughter Jane Fonda, her current fianc&eacute; Dabney Coleman and his sassy young son Doug McKeon. When McKeon is left behind with the old folks, he develops a bond with Henry that Jane feels resentful of upon her return. Hollywood and critics were positively atwitter over this film, which was basically a love letter from Jane to her dad Henry. Adapted from an acclaimed stage play, Jane purchased the rights specifically so her father could take the lead role and convinced legendary Hepburn to take the co-starring part. Unfortunately, the end result is mawkish, overly sentimental treacle akin to one of those gooey Hallmark cards for the over-70 crowd. Alas, there is not much drama in watching Henry and Kate meander aimlessly around the lake house and the film pads itself with endless lingering shots of the golden sunlight glinting off the wilderness settings. Fans of the legendary acting duo no doubt will be thrilled seeing their favorites together, but even the most die-hard Fonda and Hepburn fan will have to admit that there is not much here for one to sink their teeth into. Oscar really seemed to love this film, but it is hard to see precisely why. While it is great that Fonda finally got the Oscar that had proved elusive, to say that this role is not much of a stretch for him is an understatement. By contrast, the Oscar for Hepburn is much harder to fathom. She was coming into this already with an unprecedented three Best Actress Oscars, so there was no requirement to recognize her and the role of the wife, Ethel, is positively stillborn. Hepburn seems to recognize this fact and compensates by playing it to the rafters. She sputters, she gesticulates, she shoots out sauciness, she gets positively dewy-eyed when discussing her love, and, in one incredibly embarrassing and excruciating moment, she launches into an impromptu song and dance for no discernible reason. Hepburn is almost assuredly suffering from that deadliest of acting diseases - the BIG actress in an underwhelming role. Even worse, poor Jane is stuck playing a total clich&eacute; - the resentful daughter. The screenplay gives her nothing to work with and other than the opportunity to see her opposite her dad on screen, there are no rewards in this role. It is interesting to see Fonda paired romantically with Coleman, who was her diabolical boss in 9 to 5, but he also is trapped in a nothing part. Of the supporting roles, only the appealing McKeon is able to make an impression and he has rarely been glimpsed on the screen since then. The end result is inoffensive, but not exactly an edge of your seater. I would optimistically tell fans of Henry, Kate or Jane to seek them out in some of their far better films and not waste their time on this sappy travelogue, but they would not listen anyway. Some of the photography is quite lovely, but diabetics are definitely warned to brace themselves for some truly sloppy sentiment and sugar highs. And fans of great dialog will no doubt still cringe over the "Let's suck face" line, which remains as dreadful today as it was in 1981.

    At the 1982 Oscar ceremony, the Best Picture prize went, quite unaccountably, to CHARIOTS OF FIRE, a British epic about runners that in my opinion was not only the weakest of the five nominees but a rather boring film that really did not belong in the winners' circle. The other three were all rather large and ambitious films in their own different ways: Louis Malle's Atlantic CITY, Spielberg's legendary RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and Warren Beatty's flawed but compelling REDS. Of these, I must give a nod to Spielberg, since it would still be a decade before he would get the recognition he deserved. But as good as RAIDERS is, my favorite film of 1981 is Mark Rydell's ON GOLDEN POND, a "little" film that was released very late in 1981 amid almost no fanfare, a surprising move considering its cast: Henry Fonda in what would be his last film, Katharine Hepburn in the last role worthy of her, and Jane Fonda as the estranged daughter. I remember that the film came to town and just stayed, becoming a sleeper that before long everyone was talking about as the best thing they'd seen in years. Henry Fonda is Norman Thayer Jr, a retired professor facing his eightieth birthday with his wife Ethel (Hepburn) at their summer cottage on the titular pond (actually a good sized lake). Soon their estranged daughter Chelsea (Jane), a divorc&eacute;e, arrives on the scene with her new boyfriend (Dabney Coleman) and his teenage son (Doug McKeon) in tow. The tension between Norman and Chelsea is almost palpable, yet it soon becomes obvious that these two have been mad at each other for so long that neither of them remembers why, despite a passing remark late in the film that seems to indicate that Chelsea felt she was a disappointment to her father just because she was a girl. Chelsea and her beau are off for a month in Europe, and she persuades her parents to take care of the boy while they're gone. Norman is a bit reluctant, but agrees. The eminent critic Roger Ebert, in his review of this film, had this to say: "Simple affection is so rare in the movies. Shyness and resentment are also seldom seen. Love is much talked-about, but how often do we really believe that the characters are in love and not simply in a pleasant state of lust and like? Fragile emotions are hard to portray in a movie, and the movies that reach for them are more daring, really, than movies that bludgeon us with things like anger and revenge, which are easy to portray." In the central section of the film, the old man and the boy uneasily move from suspicion to acceptance to friendship to something that looks very much like love. It is one of Fonda's greatest performances in a career of great work, and young McKeon is a revelation, holding his own against his two older co-stars with remarkable aplomb. Hepburn is in some ways the heart of the film. At the very beginning, when she calls her husband's attention to the sound of the loons, and he replies that he hears nothing, watch the look on her face. There are a lot of those looks. A great deal is communicated without dialogue in this film. Even the final confrontation between father and daughter is done with a minimum of talk, and I defy anyone not to shed a tear during this scene. This is THE best picture of 1981, a small picture with a big heart that will surely affect even the most hardened moviegoer.

    On Golden Pond was a lovely little film. While a tad too long and perhaps a little leisurely in the pacing, the film is beautifully shot. From the cinematography and the scenery the film is gorgeous to look at. The music is also tender and poignant, while the story is beautiful and heartwarming and the script funny, intelligent and beautifully written. The direction is wonderful too, while aside from the cinematography the acting is On Golden Pond's greatest strength. Henry Honda and Katherine Hepburn give lovely performances and are very believable together while Jane Fonda is every bit as good. All in all, lovely little film, worth seeing for the cinematography and acting. 8/10 Bethany Cox
