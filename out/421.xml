    It's not often, when a director is able to a reinvent an iconic story, and make us look at a well-known piece of literature in a different light. Director Baz Luhrmann does just that. With the help of a superb cast that includes; Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, John Leguizamo among others, Luhrmann retells one of the most popular and tragic love stories of all time. The plot and dialog are authentically Shakespearean. However, Luhrmann dares to make a risky move by transporting the events of the movie into the late 1990's. The horses become flashy cars, the dagger and swords are replaced by uniquely elegant and fearsome pistols and the streets of old Verona look more like the concrete jungles of Los Angeles, in this place called Verona Beach. This move by the director is bold to say the least, but the risk sure pays off, creating one of the more original movies in the full sense of the word. This movie is fast, but does not race to the end, giving the viewer an opportunity to enjoy every scene. It is flashy and colorful, yet not overbearing or pretentiously grandiose. It is fun and tragically sad at the same time. The two most important aspects of this movie for me, were; precise attention to details, (costumes, sets, cars, weaponry,) and the fact that the movie, although being a serious one, does not take itself too seriously. The characters of the movie are vibrant and extravagant. Romeo and Juliet are young, naive, passionate and madly in love, just as they are in the play. Tybalt and Mercutio steal the movie in my opinion. They are eccentric, flashy, arrogant and aggressive yet graceful. They are the kind of characters that you want to know more about, even after their roles have expired. Not everyone will be able to appreciate this movie, just like not everyone will be excited about listening to Shakespearean style language for 2 hours (I recommend watching this movie with subtitles.) But those who do, will truly enjoy this original film, which manages to do what most movies only wish they could. It stands on its own.

    "Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes" is what sort of sums up this tragedy. And in this it shows the quickness in the two lovers decision. This story shows maybe there is love at first sight...Maybe. Now this is a classic romantic tragedy based on one of William Shakespeare's most popular plays. And it does a good job for the most part of staying true to the original. Except this goes in a modern direction in the 90's. With wild, quick, bizarre and zany approach to it all. The visuals are flamboyant and very colorful. But when it comes to Bas Luhrmann's imagery and style in this, I just didn't think it fit into the story very well. Sure adding modern imagery to a old play is a cool idea and may even work sometimes. But just wasn't digging the style when it comes to this story. The soundtrack is awesome like in most Baz Luhrmann films though. I think this movie was mainly a hit, because of Leonardo DiCaprio who is in the early stage of being a young heartthrob for teenage girls as Romeo. And is the movie that boosted Claire Danes career. Just about all the characters are over the top in this, especially John Leguizamo. Which does get a bit annoying after a while. Oh yeah, and Romeo's best friend reminded me of Chris Rock in this. But like I said Baz Luhrmann imagery and style works in his other films, but not in this one. And also seeing it now, his imagery and style just seems way too outdated. Which might be unfair but it kept me from enjoying this movie. I just couldn't get into it. When it comes to the modern setting, it just didn't make much sense when it tries to connect with the story. And I am not talking about how the guns are labeled as swords in this and the small stuff either. Personally I liked the Romeo and Juliet (1968) version better and looking forward to the 2013 version. 5.9/10

    Romeo + Juliet by Baz Luhrmann a perfect modern transposition of Shakespeare's timeless tragic romance. The good. It's perfect, I could list everything, but I'll concentrate on what makes it special. Superb designs, very colorful, for all the sets and costumes that are the result of great ideas demonstrating a lot of imagination. That alone is worth the watch. Imagination was also present in large amount in the translation to modern time. Luhrmann used all kind of artifice to enact the scenario for our delight, but also to make us understand that piece of dramatic literature. Excellent music and score, entrancing, irresistible. The actors. I feel like I have to name them all... even the boys from each family performed exceedingly well. I'll try to be brief and go for the gold. The young Leonardo DiCaprio and the young Claire Danes are the dream protagonist, simple, eager, sincere, emotional... Of the others, I'd say the most striking play came from Harold Perrineau as the energetic Mercutio, and John Leguizamo as the vengeful Tybalt. Of the lesser roles, I have to mention Pete Postlethwaite as Father Laurence, Paul Rudd as the suave Dave Paris, Dash Mihok as Romeo's cousin, and M. Emmet Walsh as the apothecary. Of course all four parents were also excellent. The bad. I would only remove the flashbacks just after the final death scene. It's very minor. The ugly. Nothing. The result. A must for all. Easily enjoyable by men and women, from teen and onward.

    "Romeo + Juliet" was virtually perfect in it's transition between time periods while adding some humor and Hollywood fun into it. It exceeded my expectations for a modernization of an old play just by the fact it uses the original text of the play almost the entire way through with very little variation. However, it could have stood using real swords. Real swords would not have fit the time period, but it would have made it slightly more believable as a whole to the audience. Having guns labeled "Dagger" or "Longsword" made it still fit what was being said, but at the same time distracts from the fact that death by sword was often very bloody and there were often more than just one wound. That aside it was over all the best remake of any Shakespeare play that I have seen in my life.

    Before I get started on this, I just want say I put spoilers because This review might contain them. A friend of mine was talking about this film with me and he accused me of disliking good films (This and a few others), so I decided to give this another watch. Anyways here are my thoughts: This movie is awful, the fact that they make the setting in modern Verona wouldn't be a problem if they modernized the DIALOGUE too. Not modernizing the dialogue just makes it confusing,and why the heck do they call their guns, swords?...In my opinion it's just stupid. The two main leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are the worst actors in this film. They do NOT know how to do Shakespearean dialogue, they come off as wooden, especially Claire Danes who rarely puts any emotion in her lines (then again neither does DiCaprio but a little more than she does), the only good actors in this film are Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postletwaite as Juliet's Nurse and Friar (Or Father in this film) Laurence, but the rest of the actors either don't put any effort into their lines, or they go overly dramatic. It's kind of a shame seeing as they got good actors for this film. ALSO why make Mercutio a DRAG QUEEN? It's unnecessary and just plain gross and even when he wasn't dressed like a woman he was still annoying. the whole thing is shot like a music video to entertain the MTV crowd/younger generation, but it made ME feel like I was on acid or something. Now there are some good things in this film,I've mentioned Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postlewaite, but there are more. First the soundtrack is good, and the beginning where they were introducing Romeo and Juliet's parents(Lord and Lady Capulet and Montague) was my favorite scene in this film (But only because the music on that part was friggin AWESOME). Then there's John Leguizamo as Tybalt, who is enjoyable because of how over the top he was, but even that can't save this atrocious film. This movie just flat out sucks, if it was meant to appeal to the younger crowd then I'm not one of them, if you're part of the MTV crowd then you'll probably like this film. If you wish to watch a good adaption of Romeo and Juliet, watch the 1968 version the acting is a LOT better in that film, or watch West Side Story (1961) which actually does the modernization right. I can't say that I would recommend Romeo and Juliet (1936) because I haven't seen that film yet, but anyways those are my two cents on this film, thanks for reading (I guess)

The acting sometimes goes overboard and makes you laugh when the scene is supposed to be sad. In the original play, the focus is more towards Juliet, as she is the one who struggles with her family, Paris, and Romeo. But in the modern film, the focus is mostly centered around Romeo. This might because the director needed the star power of DiCarprio to carry the film. The film also copies the text word for word, which will often leave you wondering what the actors are saying. Overall the movie was OK. If you are shakepaere fan, then you will enjoy it. Overall, it gets a 5/10.

    Romeo and Juliet is one of Shakespeare's most common plays. The story discusses themes like love, hatred, and society. In Baz Luhrmann's movie of Romeo + Juliet, he was able to completely capture Shakespeare's themes by expressing the story through preserving the play's original language but also adding modern aspects. Some people may believe that the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli 's Romeo and Juliet is a superior story to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, and that Luhrmann's story was just some cheap modern repeat of the same story. But this new take on Romeo and Juliet made was able to make the story more easily understandable by removing the seriousness from the play. It was also able to offer the younger generation an opportunity to comprehend the significance of this story. This movie is definitely recommendable to anyone who can appreciate Shakespeare's stories no matter what artistic form the story is produced in.

    Baz Luhrmann exceeded Shakespeare's expectations for Romeo and Juliet with this film. For example, the cast of actors chosen to portray the characters were perfect for the job. This is shown best in scenes where Romeo (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is in deep bouts of rage. The emotions expressed by the actors add an extra layer of emotion and depth to the script. Additionally, the movie style in itself is a twist on the popular play. Although the setting is modern, Luhrmann used the exact linguistics from the original play. It is possible that he chose to do that so the true meaning of the script wouldn't be lost. The contrast of Shakespearean English to a modern setting allows for the audience to better understand the language using the interactions with the characters as a guide. Even the slight changes Luhrmann made to the original script of the play enhanced the movie. In Act 5 of the play, Juliet was supposed to wake up after Romeo drank the poison; however, in the film Juliet wakes up while Romeo is taking the poison. This action made the scene all the more poignant. Any modifications made for the sake of the film enhanced the emotions and interactions present in the tragedy. All in all, I give two thumbs up.

    Many of you have probably read the original version of Romeo and Juliet, or maybe have even seen the play. How much different was this modern version from the original version? How would Shakespeare react after watching this movie? He wouldn't like it at all. The setting was completely different, and several important scenes from the play were missing. Some of the characters weren't even portrayed correctly. For example, Tybalt never beat up Romeo as it showed in the movie. Also, what is up with the policeman prince? He wasn't really a prince. The characters' overall personalities in this movie were just way too silly. This movie would not meet up to Shakespeare's expectation. He would be highly disappointed in how this movie was made. The fact that the setting was modern but the language was not, just made the movie more awkward. The language should have also been modern to match the overall theme. I do admit though that the romance was very interesting and kept my attention being a girl. Overall, I rate this movie a 2/10.

In Baz Luhrmann's movie of Romeo + Juliet, he was able to completely capture Shakespeare's themes by expressing the story through preserving the play's original language but also adding modern aspects. Some people may believe that the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli 's Romeo and Juliet is a superior story to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, and that Luhrmann's story was just some cheap modern repeat of the same story. But this new take on Romeo and Juliet made was able to make the story more easily understandable by removing the seriousness from the play. It was also able to offer the younger generation an opportunity to comprehend the significance of this story. This movie is definitely recommendable to anyone who can appreciate Shakespeare's stories no matter what artistic form the story is produced in.

    Baz Luhrmann exceeded Shakespeare's expectations for Romeo and Juliet with this film. For example, the cast of actors chosen to portray the characters were perfect for the job. This is shown best in scenes where Romeo (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is in deep bouts of rage. The emotions expressed by the actors add an extra layer of emotion and depth to the script. Additionally, the movie style in itself is a twist on the popular play. Although the setting is modern, Luhrmann used the exact linguistics from the original play. It is possible that he chose to do that so the true meaning of the script wouldn't be lost. The contrast of Shakespearean English to a modern setting allows for the audience to better understand the language using the interactions with the characters as a guide. Even the slight changes Luhrmann made to the original script of the play enhanced the movie. In Act 5 of the play, Juliet was supposed to wake up after Romeo drank the poison; however, in the film Juliet wakes up while Romeo is taking the poison. This action made the scene all the more poignant. Any modifications made for the sake of the film enhanced the emotions and interactions present in the tragedy. All in all, I give two thumbs up.

    Many of you have probably read the original version of Romeo and Juliet, or maybe have even seen the play. How much different was this modern version from the original version? How would Shakespeare react after watching this movie? He wouldn't like it at all. The setting was completely different, and several important scenes from the play were missing. Some of the characters weren't even portrayed correctly. For example, Tybalt never beat up Romeo as it showed in the movie. Also, what is up with the policeman prince? He wasn't really a prince. The characters' overall personalities in this movie were just way too silly. This movie would not meet up to Shakespeare's expectation. He would be highly disappointed in how this movie was made. The fact that the setting was modern but the language was not, just made the movie more awkward. The language should have also been modern to match the overall theme. I do admit though that the romance was very interesting and kept my attention being a girl. Overall, I rate this movie a 2/10.

    It's not often, when a director is able to a reinvent an iconic story, and make us look at a well-known piece of literature in a different light. Director Baz Luhrmann does just that. With the help of a superb cast that includes; Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, John Leguizamo among others, Luhrmann retells one of the most popular and tragic love stories of all time. The plot and dialog are authentically Shakespearean. However, Luhrmann dares to make a risky move by transporting the events of the movie into the late 1990's. The horses become flashy cars, the dagger and swords are replaced by uniquely elegant and fearsome pistols and the streets of old Verona look more like the concrete jungles of Los Angeles, in this place called Verona Beach. This move by the director is bold to say the least, but the risk sure pays off, creating one of the more original movies in the full sense of the word. This movie is fast, but does not race to the end, giving the viewer an opportunity to enjoy every scene. It is flashy and colorful, yet not overbearing or pretentiously grandiose. It is fun and tragically sad at the same time. The two most important aspects of this movie for me, were; precise attention to details, (costumes, sets, cars, weaponry,) and the fact that the movie, although being a serious one, does not take itself too seriously. The characters of the movie are vibrant and extravagant. Romeo and Juliet are young, naive, passionate and madly in love, just as they are in the play. Tybalt and Mercutio steal the movie in my opinion. They are eccentric, flashy, arrogant and aggressive yet graceful. They are the kind of characters that you want to know more about, even after their roles have expired. Not everyone will be able to appreciate this movie, just like not everyone will be excited about listening to Shakespearean style language for 2 hours (I recommend watching this movie with subtitles.) But those who do, will truly enjoy this original film, which manages to do what most movies only wish they could. It stands on its own.

    "Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes" is what sort of sums up this tragedy. And in this it shows the quickness in the two lovers decision. This story shows maybe there is love at first sight...Maybe. Now this is a classic romantic tragedy based on one of William Shakespeare's most popular plays. And it does a good job for the most part of staying true to the original. Except this goes in a modern direction in the 90's. With wild, quick, bizarre and zany approach to it all. The visuals are flamboyant and very colorful. But when it comes to Bas Luhrmann's imagery and style in this, I just didn't think it fit into the story very well. Sure adding modern imagery to a old play is a cool idea and may even work sometimes. But just wasn't digging the style when it comes to this story. The soundtrack is awesome like in most Baz Luhrmann films though. I think this movie was mainly a hit, because of Leonardo DiCaprio who is in the early stage of being a young heartthrob for teenage girls as Romeo. And is the movie that boosted Claire Danes career. Just about all the characters are over the top in this, especially John Leguizamo. Which does get a bit annoying after a while. Oh yeah, and Romeo's best friend reminded me of Chris Rock in this. But like I said Baz Luhrmann imagery and style works in his other films, but not in this one. And also seeing it now, his imagery and style just seems way too outdated. Which might be unfair but it kept me from enjoying this movie. I just couldn't get into it. When it comes to the modern setting, it just didn't make much sense when it tries to connect with the story. And I am not talking about how the guns are labeled as swords in this and the small stuff either. Personally I liked the Romeo and Juliet (1968) version better and looking forward to the 2013 version. 5.9/10

    Romeo + Juliet by Baz Luhrmann a perfect modern transposition of Shakespeare's timeless tragic romance. The good. It's perfect, I could list everything, but I'll concentrate on what makes it special. Superb designs, very colorful, for all the sets and costumes that are the result of great ideas demonstrating a lot of imagination. That alone is worth the watch. Imagination was also present in large amount in the translation to modern time. Luhrmann used all kind of artifice to enact the scenario for our delight, but also to make us understand that piece of dramatic literature. Excellent music and score, entrancing, irresistible. The actors. I feel like I have to name them all... even the boys from each family performed exceedingly well. I'll try to be brief and go for the gold. The young Leonardo DiCaprio and the young Claire Danes are the dream protagonist, simple, eager, sincere, emotional... Of the others, I'd say the most striking play came from Harold Perrineau as the energetic Mercutio, and John Leguizamo as the vengeful Tybalt. Of the lesser roles, I have to mention Pete Postlethwaite as Father Laurence, Paul Rudd as the suave Dave Paris, Dash Mihok as Romeo's cousin, and M. Emmet Walsh as the apothecary. Of course all four parents were also excellent. The bad. I would only remove the flashbacks just after the final death scene. It's very minor. The ugly. Nothing. The result. A must for all. Easily enjoyable by men and women, from teen and onward.

    "Romeo + Juliet" was virtually perfect in it's transition between time periods while adding some humor and Hollywood fun into it. It exceeded my expectations for a modernization of an old play just by the fact it uses the original text of the play almost the entire way through with very little variation. However, it could have stood using real swords. Real swords would not have fit the time period, but it would have made it slightly more believable as a whole to the audience. Having guns labeled "Dagger" or "Longsword" made it still fit what was being said, but at the same time distracts from the fact that death by sword was often very bloody and there were often more than just one wound. That aside it was over all the best remake of any Shakespeare play that I have seen in my life.

    Before I get started on this, I just want say I put spoilers because This review might contain them. A friend of mine was talking about this film with me and he accused me of disliking good films (This and a few others), so I decided to give this another watch. Anyways here are my thoughts: This movie is awful, the fact that they make the setting in modern Verona wouldn't be a problem if they modernized the DIALOGUE too. Not modernizing the dialogue just makes it confusing,and why the heck do they call their guns, swords?...In my opinion it's just stupid. The two main leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are the worst actors in this film. They do NOT know how to do Shakespearean dialogue, they come off as wooden, especially Claire Danes who rarely puts any emotion in her lines (then again neither does DiCaprio but a little more than she does), the only good actors in this film are Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postletwaite as Juliet's Nurse and Friar (Or Father in this film) Laurence, but the rest of the actors either don't put any effort into their lines, or they go overly dramatic. It's kind of a shame seeing as they got good actors for this film. ALSO why make Mercutio a DRAG QUEEN? It's unnecessary and just plain gross and even when he wasn't dressed like a woman he was still annoying. the whole thing is shot like a music video to entertain the MTV crowd/younger generation, but it made ME feel like I was on acid or something. Now there are some good things in this film,I've mentioned Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postlewaite, but there are more. First the soundtrack is good, and the beginning where they were introducing Romeo and Juliet's parents(Lord and Lady Capulet and Montague) was my favorite scene in this film (But only because the music on that part was friggin AWESOME). Then there's John Leguizamo as Tybalt, who is enjoyable because of how over the top he was, but even that can't save this atrocious film. This movie just flat out sucks, if it was meant to appeal to the younger crowd then I'm not one of them, if you're part of the MTV crowd then you'll probably like this film. If you wish to watch a good adaption of Romeo and Juliet, watch the 1968 version the acting is a LOT better in that film, or watch West Side Story (1961) which actually does the modernization right. I can't say that I would recommend Romeo and Juliet (1936) because I haven't seen that film yet, but anyways those are my two cents on this film, thanks for reading (I guess)

The film (which uses A lot of quotes as the actors Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes are always speaking like they are saying a poem or whatever)is about two people; Romeo(played by Di Caprio from my all time favourite live action movie Titanic)and Juliet(played by a unrecognizable yet fresh looking Claire Danes from Stardust)who meet at the Gala duo and fall in love. But with Juliet's restricted parents will she ever meet her Romeo again? Bottom line this movie is well OK I guess but my main problem is with all the poetic like quotes that the actors use like I mentioned before,I dunno its like annoying at times,yet Claire and Leo did a tremendous job as the two cross lovers who marry eventually and of course tragedy strikes(yeah and if you want to know what that is well here it is. Spoilers Romeo gets poisoned and Juliet(who cannot live without him)grabs his gun and shoots herself and dies in the church with him. Overall it wasn't my cup of tea and the ending as terrible so i'm giving it a 4/10

    The 1997 version of Romeo and Juliet is a modern take on Shakespeare's original play. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Romeo. The film did a good job of recreating the original play, but to a fault. The acting sometimes goes overboard and makes you laugh when the scene is supposed to be sad. In the original play, the focus is more towards Juliet, as she is the one who struggles with her family, Paris, and Romeo. But in the modern film, the focus is mostly centered around Romeo. This might because the director needed the star power of DiCarprio to carry the film. The film also copies the text word for word, which will often leave you wondering what the actors are saying. Overall the movie was OK. If you are shakepaere fan, then you will enjoy it. Overall, it gets a 5/10.

    The 1997 version of Romeo and Juliet is a modern take on Shakespeare's original play. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Romeo. The film did a good job of recreating the original play, but to a fault. The acting sometimes goes overboard and makes you laugh when the scene is supposed to be sad. In the original play, the focus is more towards Juliet, as she is the one who struggles with her family, Paris, and Romeo. But in the modern film, the focus is mostly centered around Romeo. This might because the director needed the star power of DiCarprio to carry the film. The film also copies the text word for word, which will often leave you wondering what the actors are saying. Overall the movie was OK. If you are shakepaere fan, then you will enjoy it. Overall, it gets a 5/10.

    Romeo and Juliet is one of Shakespeare's most common plays. The story discusses themes like love, hatred, and society. In Baz Luhrmann's movie of Romeo + Juliet, he was able to completely capture Shakespeare's themes by expressing the story through preserving the play's original language but also adding modern aspects. Some people may believe that the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli 's Romeo and Juliet is a superior story to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, and that Luhrmann's story was just some cheap modern repeat of the same story. But this new take on Romeo and Juliet made was able to make the story more easily understandable by removing the seriousness from the play. It was also able to offer the younger generation an opportunity to comprehend the significance of this story. This movie is definitely recommendable to anyone who can appreciate Shakespeare's stories no matter what artistic form the story is produced in.

    Baz Luhrmann exceeded Shakespeare's expectations for Romeo and Juliet with this film. For example, the cast of actors chosen to portray the characters were perfect for the job. This is shown best in scenes where Romeo (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is in deep bouts of rage. The emotions expressed by the actors add an extra layer of emotion and depth to the script. Additionally, the movie style in itself is a twist on the popular play. Although the setting is modern, Luhrmann used the exact linguistics from the original play. It is possible that he chose to do that so the true meaning of the script wouldn't be lost. The contrast of Shakespearean English to a modern setting allows for the audience to better understand the language using the interactions with the characters as a guide. Even the slight changes Luhrmann made to the original script of the play enhanced the movie. In Act 5 of the play, Juliet was supposed to wake up after Romeo drank the poison; however, in the film Juliet wakes up while Romeo is taking the poison. This action made the scene all the more poignant. Any modifications made for the sake of the film enhanced the emotions and interactions present in the tragedy. All in all, I give two thumbs up.

    Many of you have probably read the original version of Romeo and Juliet, or maybe have even seen the play. How much different was this modern version from the original version? How would Shakespeare react after watching this movie? He wouldn't like it at all. The setting was completely different, and several important scenes from the play were missing. Some of the characters weren't even portrayed correctly. For example, Tybalt never beat up Romeo as it showed in the movie. Also, what is up with the policeman prince? He wasn't really a prince. The characters' overall personalities in this movie were just way too silly. This movie would not meet up to Shakespeare's expectation. He would be highly disappointed in how this movie was made. The fact that the setting was modern but the language was not, just made the movie more awkward. The language should have also been modern to match the overall theme. I do admit though that the romance was very interesting and kept my attention being a girl. Overall, I rate this movie a 2/10.

    It's not often, when a director is able to a reinvent an iconic story, and make us look at a well-known piece of literature in a different light. Director Baz Luhrmann does just that. With the help of a superb cast that includes; Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, John Leguizamo among others, Luhrmann retells one of the most popular and tragic love stories of all time. The plot and dialog are authentically Shakespearean. However, Luhrmann dares to make a risky move by transporting the events of the movie into the late 1990's. The horses become flashy cars, the dagger and swords are replaced by uniquely elegant and fearsome pistols and the streets of old Verona look more like the concrete jungles of Los Angeles, in this place called Verona Beach. This move by the director is bold to say the least, but the risk sure pays off, creating one of the more original movies in the full sense of the word. This movie is fast, but does not race to the end, giving the viewer an opportunity to enjoy every scene. It is flashy and colorful, yet not overbearing or pretentiously grandiose. It is fun and tragically sad at the same time. The two most important aspects of this movie for me, were; precise attention to details, (costumes, sets, cars, weaponry,) and the fact that the movie, although being a serious one, does not take itself too seriously. The characters of the movie are vibrant and extravagant. Romeo and Juliet are young, naive, passionate and madly in love, just as they are in the play. Tybalt and Mercutio steal the movie in my opinion. They are eccentric, flashy, arrogant and aggressive yet graceful. They are the kind of characters that you want to know more about, even after their roles have expired. Not everyone will be able to appreciate this movie, just like not everyone will be excited about listening to Shakespearean style language for 2 hours (I recommend watching this movie with subtitles.) But those who do, will truly enjoy this original film, which manages to do what most movies only wish they could. It stands on its own.

    "Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes" is what sort of sums up this tragedy. And in this it shows the quickness in the two lovers decision. This story shows maybe there is love at first sight...Maybe. Now this is a classic romantic tragedy based on one of William Shakespeare's most popular plays. And it does a good job for the most part of staying true to the original. Except this goes in a modern direction in the 90's. With wild, quick, bizarre and zany approach to it all. The visuals are flamboyant and very colorful. But when it comes to Bas Luhrmann's imagery and style in this, I just didn't think it fit into the story very well. Sure adding modern imagery to a old play is a cool idea and may even work sometimes. But just wasn't digging the style when it comes to this story. The soundtrack is awesome like in most Baz Luhrmann films though. I think this movie was mainly a hit, because of Leonardo DiCaprio who is in the early stage of being a young heartthrob for teenage girls as Romeo. And is the movie that boosted Claire Danes career. Just about all the characters are over the top in this, especially John Leguizamo. Which does get a bit annoying after a while. Oh yeah, and Romeo's best friend reminded me of Chris Rock in this. But like I said Baz Luhrmann imagery and style works in his other films, but not in this one. And also seeing it now, his imagery and style just seems way too outdated. Which might be unfair but it kept me from enjoying this movie. I just couldn't get into it. When it comes to the modern setting, it just didn't make much sense when it tries to connect with the story. And I am not talking about how the guns are labeled as swords in this and the small stuff either. Personally I liked the Romeo and Juliet (1968) version better and looking forward to the 2013 version. 5.9/10

    Romeo + Juliet by Baz Luhrmann a perfect modern transposition of Shakespeare's timeless tragic romance. The good. It's perfect, I could list everything, but I'll concentrate on what makes it special. Superb designs, very colorful, for all the sets and costumes that are the result of great ideas demonstrating a lot of imagination. That alone is worth the watch. Imagination was also present in large amount in the translation to modern time. Luhrmann used all kind of artifice to enact the scenario for our delight, but also to make us understand that piece of dramatic literature. Excellent music and score, entrancing, irresistible. The actors. I feel like I have to name them all... even the boys from each family performed exceedingly well. I'll try to be brief and go for the gold. The young Leonardo DiCaprio and the young Claire Danes are the dream protagonist, simple, eager, sincere, emotional... Of the others, I'd say the most striking play came from Harold Perrineau as the energetic Mercutio, and John Leguizamo as the vengeful Tybalt. Of the lesser roles, I have to mention Pete Postlethwaite as Father Laurence, Paul Rudd as the suave Dave Paris, Dash Mihok as Romeo's cousin, and M. Emmet Walsh as the apothecary. Of course all four parents were also excellent. The bad. I would only remove the flashbacks just after the final death scene. It's very minor. The ugly. Nothing. The result. A must for all. Easily enjoyable by men and women, from teen and onward.

    "Romeo + Juliet" was virtually perfect in it's transition between time periods while adding some humor and Hollywood fun into it. It exceeded my expectations for a modernization of an old play just by the fact it uses the original text of the play almost the entire way through with very little variation. However, it could have stood using real swords. Real swords would not have fit the time period, but it would have made it slightly more believable as a whole to the audience. Having guns labeled "Dagger" or "Longsword" made it still fit what was being said, but at the same time distracts from the fact that death by sword was often very bloody and there were often more than just one wound. That aside it was over all the best remake of any Shakespeare play that I have seen in my life.

    Before I get started on this, I just want say I put spoilers because This review might contain them. A friend of mine was talking about this film with me and he accused me of disliking good films (This and a few others), so I decided to give this another watch. Anyways here are my thoughts: This movie is awful, the fact that they make the setting in modern Verona wouldn't be a problem if they modernized the DIALOGUE too. Not modernizing the dialogue just makes it confusing,and why the heck do they call their guns, swords?...In my opinion it's just stupid. The two main leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are the worst actors in this film. They do NOT know how to do Shakespearean dialogue, they come off as wooden, especially Claire Danes who rarely puts any emotion in her lines (then again neither does DiCaprio but a little more than she does), the only good actors in this film are Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postletwaite as Juliet's Nurse and Friar (Or Father in this film) Laurence, but the rest of the actors either don't put any effort into their lines, or they go overly dramatic. It's kind of a shame seeing as they got good actors for this film. ALSO why make Mercutio a DRAG QUEEN? It's unnecessary and just plain gross and even when he wasn't dressed like a woman he was still annoying. the whole thing is shot like a music video to entertain the MTV crowd/younger generation, but it made ME feel like I was on acid or something. Now there are some good things in this film,I've mentioned Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postlewaite, but there are more. First the soundtrack is good, and the beginning where they were introducing Romeo and Juliet's parents(Lord and Lady Capulet and Montague) was my favorite scene in this film (But only because the music on that part was friggin AWESOME). Then there's John Leguizamo as Tybalt, who is enjoyable because of how over the top he was, but even that can't save this atrocious film. This movie just flat out sucks, if it was meant to appeal to the younger crowd then I'm not one of them, if you're part of the MTV crowd then you'll probably like this film. If you wish to watch a good adaption of Romeo and Juliet, watch the 1968 version the acting is a LOT better in that film, or watch West Side Story (1961) which actually does the modernization right. I can't say that I would recommend Romeo and Juliet (1936) because I haven't seen that film yet, but anyways those are my two cents on this film, thanks for reading (I guess)

    I haven't seen this movie in a very long time but quite frankly I remember the WHOLE thing. The film (which uses A lot of quotes as the actors Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes are always speaking like they are saying a poem or whatever)is about two people; Romeo(played by Di Caprio from my all time favourite live action movie Titanic)and Juliet(played by a unrecognizable yet fresh looking Claire Danes from Stardust)who meet at the Gala duo and fall in love. But with Juliet's restricted parents will she ever meet her Romeo again? Bottom line this movie is well OK I guess but my main problem is with all the poetic like quotes that the actors use like I mentioned before,I dunno its like annoying at times,yet Claire and Leo did a tremendous job as the two cross lovers who marry eventually and of course tragedy strikes(yeah and if you want to know what that is well here it is. Spoilers Romeo gets poisoned and Juliet(who cannot live without him)grabs his gun and shoots herself and dies in the church with him. Overall it wasn't my cup of tea and the ending as terrible so i'm giving it a 4/10

    I haven't seen this movie in a very long time but quite frankly I remember the WHOLE thing. The film (which uses A lot of quotes as the actors Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes are always speaking like they are saying a poem or whatever)is about two people; Romeo(played by Di Caprio from my all time favourite live action movie Titanic)and Juliet(played by a unrecognizable yet fresh looking Claire Danes from Stardust)who meet at the Gala duo and fall in love. But with Juliet's restricted parents will she ever meet her Romeo again? Bottom line this movie is well OK I guess but my main problem is with all the poetic like quotes that the actors use like I mentioned before,I dunno its like annoying at times,yet Claire and Leo did a tremendous job as the two cross lovers who marry eventually and of course tragedy strikes(yeah and if you want to know what that is well here it is. Spoilers Romeo gets poisoned and Juliet(who cannot live without him)grabs his gun and shoots herself and dies in the church with him. Overall it wasn't my cup of tea and the ending as terrible so i'm giving it a 4/10

    The 1997 version of Romeo and Juliet is a modern take on Shakespeare's original play. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Romeo. The film did a good job of recreating the original play, but to a fault. The acting sometimes goes overboard and makes you laugh when the scene is supposed to be sad. In the original play, the focus is more towards Juliet, as she is the one who struggles with her family, Paris, and Romeo. But in the modern film, the focus is mostly centered around Romeo. This might because the director needed the star power of DiCarprio to carry the film. The film also copies the text word for word, which will often leave you wondering what the actors are saying. Overall the movie was OK. If you are shakepaere fan, then you will enjoy it. Overall, it gets a 5/10.

    Romeo and Juliet is one of Shakespeare's most common plays. The story discusses themes like love, hatred, and society. In Baz Luhrmann's movie of Romeo + Juliet, he was able to completely capture Shakespeare's themes by expressing the story through preserving the play's original language but also adding modern aspects. Some people may believe that the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli 's Romeo and Juliet is a superior story to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, and that Luhrmann's story was just some cheap modern repeat of the same story. But this new take on Romeo and Juliet made was able to make the story more easily understandable by removing the seriousness from the play. It was also able to offer the younger generation an opportunity to comprehend the significance of this story. This movie is definitely recommendable to anyone who can appreciate Shakespeare's stories no matter what artistic form the story is produced in.

    Baz Luhrmann exceeded Shakespeare's expectations for Romeo and Juliet with this film. For example, the cast of actors chosen to portray the characters were perfect for the job. This is shown best in scenes where Romeo (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is in deep bouts of rage. The emotions expressed by the actors add an extra layer of emotion and depth to the script. Additionally, the movie style in itself is a twist on the popular play. Although the setting is modern, Luhrmann used the exact linguistics from the original play. It is possible that he chose to do that so the true meaning of the script wouldn't be lost. The contrast of Shakespearean English to a modern setting allows for the audience to better understand the language using the interactions with the characters as a guide. Even the slight changes Luhrmann made to the original script of the play enhanced the movie. In Act 5 of the play, Juliet was supposed to wake up after Romeo drank the poison; however, in the film Juliet wakes up while Romeo is taking the poison. This action made the scene all the more poignant. Any modifications made for the sake of the film enhanced the emotions and interactions present in the tragedy. All in all, I give two thumbs up.

    Many of you have probably read the original version of Romeo and Juliet, or maybe have even seen the play. How much different was this modern version from the original version? How would Shakespeare react after watching this movie? He wouldn't like it at all. The setting was completely different, and several important scenes from the play were missing. Some of the characters weren't even portrayed correctly. For example, Tybalt never beat up Romeo as it showed in the movie. Also, what is up with the policeman prince? He wasn't really a prince. The characters' overall personalities in this movie were just way too silly. This movie would not meet up to Shakespeare's expectation. He would be highly disappointed in how this movie was made. The fact that the setting was modern but the language was not, just made the movie more awkward. The language should have also been modern to match the overall theme. I do admit though that the romance was very interesting and kept my attention being a girl. Overall, I rate this movie a 2/10.

    It's not often, when a director is able to a reinvent an iconic story, and make us look at a well-known piece of literature in a different light. Director Baz Luhrmann does just that. With the help of a superb cast that includes; Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, John Leguizamo among others, Luhrmann retells one of the most popular and tragic love stories of all time. The plot and dialog are authentically Shakespearean. However, Luhrmann dares to make a risky move by transporting the events of the movie into the late 1990's. The horses become flashy cars, the dagger and swords are replaced by uniquely elegant and fearsome pistols and the streets of old Verona look more like the concrete jungles of Los Angeles, in this place called Verona Beach. This move by the director is bold to say the least, but the risk sure pays off, creating one of the more original movies in the full sense of the word. This movie is fast, but does not race to the end, giving the viewer an opportunity to enjoy every scene. It is flashy and colorful, yet not overbearing or pretentiously grandiose. It is fun and tragically sad at the same time. The two most important aspects of this movie for me, were; precise attention to details, (costumes, sets, cars, weaponry,) and the fact that the movie, although being a serious one, does not take itself too seriously. The characters of the movie are vibrant and extravagant. Romeo and Juliet are young, naive, passionate and madly in love, just as they are in the play. Tybalt and Mercutio steal the movie in my opinion. They are eccentric, flashy, arrogant and aggressive yet graceful. They are the kind of characters that you want to know more about, even after their roles have expired. Not everyone will be able to appreciate this movie, just like not everyone will be excited about listening to Shakespearean style language for 2 hours (I recommend watching this movie with subtitles.) But those who do, will truly enjoy this original film, which manages to do what most movies only wish they could. It stands on its own.

    "Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes" is what sort of sums up this tragedy. And in this it shows the quickness in the two lovers decision. This story shows maybe there is love at first sight...Maybe. Now this is a classic romantic tragedy based on one of William Shakespeare's most popular plays. And it does a good job for the most part of staying true to the original. Except this goes in a modern direction in the 90's. With wild, quick, bizarre and zany approach to it all. The visuals are flamboyant and very colorful. But when it comes to Bas Luhrmann's imagery and style in this, I just didn't think it fit into the story very well. Sure adding modern imagery to a old play is a cool idea and may even work sometimes. But just wasn't digging the style when it comes to this story. The soundtrack is awesome like in most Baz Luhrmann films though. I think this movie was mainly a hit, because of Leonardo DiCaprio who is in the early stage of being a young heartthrob for teenage girls as Romeo. And is the movie that boosted Claire Danes career. Just about all the characters are over the top in this, especially John Leguizamo. Which does get a bit annoying after a while. Oh yeah, and Romeo's best friend reminded me of Chris Rock in this. But like I said Baz Luhrmann imagery and style works in his other films, but not in this one. And also seeing it now, his imagery and style just seems way too outdated. Which might be unfair but it kept me from enjoying this movie. I just couldn't get into it. When it comes to the modern setting, it just didn't make much sense when it tries to connect with the story. And I am not talking about how the guns are labeled as swords in this and the small stuff either. Personally I liked the Romeo and Juliet (1968) version better and looking forward to the 2013 version. 5.9/10

    Romeo + Juliet by Baz Luhrmann a perfect modern transposition of Shakespeare's timeless tragic romance. The good. It's perfect, I could list everything, but I'll concentrate on what makes it special. Superb designs, very colorful, for all the sets and costumes that are the result of great ideas demonstrating a lot of imagination. That alone is worth the watch. Imagination was also present in large amount in the translation to modern time. Luhrmann used all kind of artifice to enact the scenario for our delight, but also to make us understand that piece of dramatic literature. Excellent music and score, entrancing, irresistible. The actors. I feel like I have to name them all... even the boys from each family performed exceedingly well. I'll try to be brief and go for the gold. The young Leonardo DiCaprio and the young Claire Danes are the dream protagonist, simple, eager, sincere, emotional... Of the others, I'd say the most striking play came from Harold Perrineau as the energetic Mercutio, and John Leguizamo as the vengeful Tybalt. Of the lesser roles, I have to mention Pete Postlethwaite as Father Laurence, Paul Rudd as the suave Dave Paris, Dash Mihok as Romeo's cousin, and M. Emmet Walsh as the apothecary. Of course all four parents were also excellent. The bad. I would only remove the flashbacks just after the final death scene. It's very minor. The ugly. Nothing. The result. A must for all. Easily enjoyable by men and women, from teen and onward.

    "Romeo + Juliet" was virtually perfect in it's transition between time periods while adding some humor and Hollywood fun into it. It exceeded my expectations for a modernization of an old play just by the fact it uses the original text of the play almost the entire way through with very little variation. However, it could have stood using real swords. Real swords would not have fit the time period, but it would have made it slightly more believable as a whole to the audience. Having guns labeled "Dagger" or "Longsword" made it still fit what was being said, but at the same time distracts from the fact that death by sword was often very bloody and there were often more than just one wound. That aside it was over all the best remake of any Shakespeare play that I have seen in my life.

    Before I get started on this, I just want say I put spoilers because This review might contain them. A friend of mine was talking about this film with me and he accused me of disliking good films (This and a few others), so I decided to give this another watch. Anyways here are my thoughts: This movie is awful, the fact that they make the setting in modern Verona wouldn't be a problem if they modernized the DIALOGUE too. Not modernizing the dialogue just makes it confusing,and why the heck do they call their guns, swords?...In my opinion it's just stupid. The two main leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are the worst actors in this film. They do NOT know how to do Shakespearean dialogue, they come off as wooden, especially Claire Danes who rarely puts any emotion in her lines (then again neither does DiCaprio but a little more than she does), the only good actors in this film are Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postletwaite as Juliet's Nurse and Friar (Or Father in this film) Laurence, but the rest of the actors either don't put any effort into their lines, or they go overly dramatic. It's kind of a shame seeing as they got good actors for this film. ALSO why make Mercutio a DRAG QUEEN? It's unnecessary and just plain gross and even when he wasn't dressed like a woman he was still annoying. the whole thing is shot like a music video to entertain the MTV crowd/younger generation, but it made ME feel like I was on acid or something. Now there are some good things in this film,I've mentioned Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postlewaite, but there are more. First the soundtrack is good, and the beginning where they were introducing Romeo and Juliet's parents(Lord and Lady Capulet and Montague) was my favorite scene in this film (But only because the music on that part was friggin AWESOME). Then there's John Leguizamo as Tybalt, who is enjoyable because of how over the top he was, but even that can't save this atrocious film. This movie just flat out sucks, if it was meant to appeal to the younger crowd then I'm not one of them, if you're part of the MTV crowd then you'll probably like this film. If you wish to watch a good adaption of Romeo and Juliet, watch the 1968 version the acting is a LOT better in that film, or watch West Side Story (1961) which actually does the modernization right. I can't say that I would recommend Romeo and Juliet (1936) because I haven't seen that film yet, but anyways those are my two cents on this film, thanks for reading (I guess)

The two main leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are the worst actors in this film. They do NOT know how to do Shakespearean dialogue, they come off as wooden, especially Claire Danes who rarely puts any emotion in her lines (then again neither does DiCaprio but a little more than she does), the only good actors in this film are Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postletwaite as Juliet's Nurse and Friar (Or Father in this film) Laurence, but the rest of the actors either don't put any effort into their lines, or they go overly dramatic. It's kind of a shame seeing as they got good actors for this film. ALSO why make Mercutio a DRAG QUEEN? It's unnecessary and just plain gross and even when he wasn't dressed like a woman he was still annoying. the whole thing is shot like a music video to entertain the MTV crowd/younger generation, but it made ME feel like I was on acid or something. Now there are some good things in this film,I've mentioned Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postlewaite, but there are more. First the soundtrack is good, and the beginning where they were introducing Romeo and Juliet's parents(Lord and Lady Capulet and Montague) was my favorite scene in this film (But only because the music on that part was friggin AWESOME). Then there's John Leguizamo as Tybalt, who is enjoyable because of how over the top he was, but even that can't save this atrocious film. This movie just flat out sucks, if it was meant to appeal to the younger crowd then I'm not one of them, if you're part of the MTV crowd then you'll probably like this film. If you wish to watch a good adaption of Romeo and Juliet, watch the 1968 version the acting is a LOT better in that film, or watch West Side Story (1961) which actually does the modernization right. I can't say that I would recommend Romeo and Juliet (1936) because I haven't seen that film yet, but anyways those are my two cents on this film, thanks for reading (I guess)

    I haven't seen this movie in a very long time but quite frankly I remember the WHOLE thing. The film (which uses A lot of quotes as the actors Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes are always speaking like they are saying a poem or whatever)is about two people; Romeo(played by Di Caprio from my all time favourite live action movie Titanic)and Juliet(played by a unrecognizable yet fresh looking Claire Danes from Stardust)who meet at the Gala duo and fall in love. But with Juliet's restricted parents will she ever meet her Romeo again? Bottom line this movie is well OK I guess but my main problem is with all the poetic like quotes that the actors use like I mentioned before,I dunno its like annoying at times,yet Claire and Leo did a tremendous job as the two cross lovers who marry eventually and of course tragedy strikes(yeah and if you want to know what that is well here it is. Spoilers Romeo gets poisoned and Juliet(who cannot live without him)grabs his gun and shoots herself and dies in the church with him. Overall it wasn't my cup of tea and the ending as terrible so i'm giving it a 4/10

    The 1997 version of Romeo and Juliet is a modern take on Shakespeare's original play. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Romeo. The film did a good job of recreating the original play, but to a fault. The acting sometimes goes overboard and makes you laugh when the scene is supposed to be sad. In the original play, the focus is more towards Juliet, as she is the one who struggles with her family, Paris, and Romeo. But in the modern film, the focus is mostly centered around Romeo. This might because the director needed the star power of DiCarprio to carry the film. The film also copies the text word for word, which will often leave you wondering what the actors are saying. Overall the movie was OK. If you are shakepaere fan, then you will enjoy it. Overall, it gets a 5/10.

    Romeo and Juliet is one of Shakespeare's most common plays. The story discusses themes like love, hatred, and society. In Baz Luhrmann's movie of Romeo + Juliet, he was able to completely capture Shakespeare's themes by expressing the story through preserving the play's original language but also adding modern aspects. Some people may believe that the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli 's Romeo and Juliet is a superior story to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, and that Luhrmann's story was just some cheap modern repeat of the same story. But this new take on Romeo and Juliet made was able to make the story more easily understandable by removing the seriousness from the play. It was also able to offer the younger generation an opportunity to comprehend the significance of this story. This movie is definitely recommendable to anyone who can appreciate Shakespeare's stories no matter what artistic form the story is produced in.

    Baz Luhrmann exceeded Shakespeare's expectations for Romeo and Juliet with this film. For example, the cast of actors chosen to portray the characters were perfect for the job. This is shown best in scenes where Romeo (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is in deep bouts of rage. The emotions expressed by the actors add an extra layer of emotion and depth to the script. Additionally, the movie style in itself is a twist on the popular play. Although the setting is modern, Luhrmann used the exact linguistics from the original play. It is possible that he chose to do that so the true meaning of the script wouldn't be lost. The contrast of Shakespearean English to a modern setting allows for the audience to better understand the language using the interactions with the characters as a guide. Even the slight changes Luhrmann made to the original script of the play enhanced the movie. In Act 5 of the play, Juliet was supposed to wake up after Romeo drank the poison; however, in the film Juliet wakes up while Romeo is taking the poison. This action made the scene all the more poignant. Any modifications made for the sake of the film enhanced the emotions and interactions present in the tragedy. All in all, I give two thumbs up.

    Many of you have probably read the original version of Romeo and Juliet, or maybe have even seen the play. How much different was this modern version from the original version? How would Shakespeare react after watching this movie? He wouldn't like it at all. The setting was completely different, and several important scenes from the play were missing. Some of the characters weren't even portrayed correctly. For example, Tybalt never beat up Romeo as it showed in the movie. Also, what is up with the policeman prince? He wasn't really a prince. The characters' overall personalities in this movie were just way too silly. This movie would not meet up to Shakespeare's expectation. He would be highly disappointed in how this movie was made. The fact that the setting was modern but the language was not, just made the movie more awkward. The language should have also been modern to match the overall theme. I do admit though that the romance was very interesting and kept my attention being a girl. Overall, I rate this movie a 2/10.

    It's not often, when a director is able to a reinvent an iconic story, and make us look at a well-known piece of literature in a different light. Director Baz Luhrmann does just that. With the help of a superb cast that includes; Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, John Leguizamo among others, Luhrmann retells one of the most popular and tragic love stories of all time. The plot and dialog are authentically Shakespearean. However, Luhrmann dares to make a risky move by transporting the events of the movie into the late 1990's. The horses become flashy cars, the dagger and swords are replaced by uniquely elegant and fearsome pistols and the streets of old Verona look more like the concrete jungles of Los Angeles, in this place called Verona Beach. This move by the director is bold to say the least, but the risk sure pays off, creating one of the more original movies in the full sense of the word. This movie is fast, but does not race to the end, giving the viewer an opportunity to enjoy every scene. It is flashy and colorful, yet not overbearing or pretentiously grandiose. It is fun and tragically sad at the same time. The two most important aspects of this movie for me, were; precise attention to details, (costumes, sets, cars, weaponry,) and the fact that the movie, although being a serious one, does not take itself too seriously. The characters of the movie are vibrant and extravagant. Romeo and Juliet are young, naive, passionate and madly in love, just as they are in the play. Tybalt and Mercutio steal the movie in my opinion. They are eccentric, flashy, arrogant and aggressive yet graceful. They are the kind of characters that you want to know more about, even after their roles have expired. Not everyone will be able to appreciate this movie, just like not everyone will be excited about listening to Shakespearean style language for 2 hours (I recommend watching this movie with subtitles.) But those who do, will truly enjoy this original film, which manages to do what most movies only wish they could. It stands on its own.

    "Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes" is what sort of sums up this tragedy. And in this it shows the quickness in the two lovers decision. This story shows maybe there is love at first sight...Maybe. Now this is a classic romantic tragedy based on one of William Shakespeare's most popular plays. And it does a good job for the most part of staying true to the original. Except this goes in a modern direction in the 90's. With wild, quick, bizarre and zany approach to it all. The visuals are flamboyant and very colorful. But when it comes to Bas Luhrmann's imagery and style in this, I just didn't think it fit into the story very well. Sure adding modern imagery to a old play is a cool idea and may even work sometimes. But just wasn't digging the style when it comes to this story. The soundtrack is awesome like in most Baz Luhrmann films though. I think this movie was mainly a hit, because of Leonardo DiCaprio who is in the early stage of being a young heartthrob for teenage girls as Romeo. And is the movie that boosted Claire Danes career. Just about all the characters are over the top in this, especially John Leguizamo. Which does get a bit annoying after a while. Oh yeah, and Romeo's best friend reminded me of Chris Rock in this. But like I said Baz Luhrmann imagery and style works in his other films, but not in this one. And also seeing it now, his imagery and style just seems way too outdated. Which might be unfair but it kept me from enjoying this movie. I just couldn't get into it. When it comes to the modern setting, it just didn't make much sense when it tries to connect with the story. And I am not talking about how the guns are labeled as swords in this and the small stuff either. Personally I liked the Romeo and Juliet (1968) version better and looking forward to the 2013 version. 5.9/10

    Romeo + Juliet by Baz Luhrmann a perfect modern transposition of Shakespeare's timeless tragic romance. The good. It's perfect, I could list everything, but I'll concentrate on what makes it special. Superb designs, very colorful, for all the sets and costumes that are the result of great ideas demonstrating a lot of imagination. That alone is worth the watch. Imagination was also present in large amount in the translation to modern time. Luhrmann used all kind of artifice to enact the scenario for our delight, but also to make us understand that piece of dramatic literature. Excellent music and score, entrancing, irresistible. The actors. I feel like I have to name them all... even the boys from each family performed exceedingly well. I'll try to be brief and go for the gold. The young Leonardo DiCaprio and the young Claire Danes are the dream protagonist, simple, eager, sincere, emotional... Of the others, I'd say the most striking play came from Harold Perrineau as the energetic Mercutio, and John Leguizamo as the vengeful Tybalt. Of the lesser roles, I have to mention Pete Postlethwaite as Father Laurence, Paul Rudd as the suave Dave Paris, Dash Mihok as Romeo's cousin, and M. Emmet Walsh as the apothecary. Of course all four parents were also excellent. The bad. I would only remove the flashbacks just after the final death scene. It's very minor. The ugly. Nothing. The result. A must for all. Easily enjoyable by men and women, from teen and onward.

    "Romeo + Juliet" was virtually perfect in it's transition between time periods while adding some humor and Hollywood fun into it. It exceeded my expectations for a modernization of an old play just by the fact it uses the original text of the play almost the entire way through with very little variation. However, it could have stood using real swords. Real swords would not have fit the time period, but it would have made it slightly more believable as a whole to the audience. Having guns labeled "Dagger" or "Longsword" made it still fit what was being said, but at the same time distracts from the fact that death by sword was often very bloody and there were often more than just one wound. That aside it was over all the best remake of any Shakespeare play that I have seen in my life.

    Before I get started on this, I just want say I put spoilers because This review might contain them. A friend of mine was talking about this film with me and he accused me of disliking good films (This and a few others), so I decided to give this another watch. Anyways here are my thoughts: This movie is awful, the fact that they make the setting in modern Verona wouldn't be a problem if they modernized the DIALOGUE too. Not modernizing the dialogue just makes it confusing,and why the heck do they call their guns, swords?...In my opinion it's just stupid. The two main leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are the worst actors in this film. They do NOT know how to do Shakespearean dialogue, they come off as wooden, especially Claire Danes who rarely puts any emotion in her lines (then again neither does DiCaprio but a little more than she does), the only good actors in this film are Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postletwaite as Juliet's Nurse and Friar (Or Father in this film) Laurence, but the rest of the actors either don't put any effort into their lines, or they go overly dramatic. It's kind of a shame seeing as they got good actors for this film. ALSO why make Mercutio a DRAG QUEEN? It's unnecessary and just plain gross and even when he wasn't dressed like a woman he was still annoying. the whole thing is shot like a music video to entertain the MTV crowd/younger generation, but it made ME feel like I was on acid or something. Now there are some good things in this film,I've mentioned Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postlewaite, but there are more. First the soundtrack is good, and the beginning where they were introducing Romeo and Juliet's parents(Lord and Lady Capulet and Montague) was my favorite scene in this film (But only because the music on that part was friggin AWESOME). Then there's John Leguizamo as Tybalt, who is enjoyable because of how over the top he was, but even that can't save this atrocious film. This movie just flat out sucks, if it was meant to appeal to the younger crowd then I'm not one of them, if you're part of the MTV crowd then you'll probably like this film. If you wish to watch a good adaption of Romeo and Juliet, watch the 1968 version the acting is a LOT better in that film, or watch West Side Story (1961) which actually does the modernization right.

    "Romeo + Juliet" was virtually perfect in it's transition between time periods while adding some humor and Hollywood fun into it. It exceeded my expectations for a modernization of an old play just by the fact it uses the original text of the play almost the entire way through with very little variation. However, it could have stood using real swords. Real swords would not have fit the time period, but it would have made it slightly more believable as a whole to the audience. Having guns labeled "Dagger" or "Longsword" made it still fit what was being said, but at the same time distracts from the fact that death by sword was often very bloody and there were often more than just one wound. That aside it was over all the best remake of any Shakespeare play that I have seen in my life.

    Before I get started on this, I just want say I put spoilers because This review might contain them. A friend of mine was talking about this film with me and he accused me of disliking good films (This and a few others), so I decided to give this another watch. Anyways here are my thoughts: This movie is awful, the fact that they make the setting in modern Verona wouldn't be a problem if they modernized the DIALOGUE too. Not modernizing the dialogue just makes it confusing,and why the heck do they call their guns, swords?...In my opinion it's just stupid. The two main leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are the worst actors in this film. They do NOT know how to do Shakespearean dialogue, they come off as wooden, especially Claire Danes who rarely puts any emotion in her lines (then again neither does DiCaprio but a little more than she does), the only good actors in this film are Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postletwaite as Juliet's Nurse and Friar (Or Father in this film) Laurence, but the rest of the actors either don't put any effort into their lines, or they go overly dramatic. It's kind of a shame seeing as they got good actors for this film. ALSO why make Mercutio a DRAG QUEEN? It's unnecessary and just plain gross and even when he wasn't dressed like a woman he was still annoying. the whole thing is shot like a music video to entertain the MTV crowd/younger generation, but it made ME feel like I was on acid or something. Now there are some good things in this film,I've mentioned Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postlewaite, but there are more. First the soundtrack is good, and the beginning where they were introducing Romeo and Juliet's parents(Lord and Lady Capulet and Montague) was my favorite scene in this film (But only because the music on that part was friggin AWESOME). Then there's John Leguizamo as Tybalt, who is enjoyable because of how over the top he was, but even that can't save this atrocious film. This movie just flat out sucks, if it was meant to appeal to the younger crowd then I'm not one of them, if you're part of the MTV crowd then you'll probably like this film. If you wish to watch a good adaption of Romeo and Juliet, watch the 1968 version the acting is a LOT better in that film, or watch West Side Story (1961) which actually does the modernization right. I can't say that I would recommend Romeo and Juliet (1936) because I haven't seen that film yet, but anyways those are my two cents on this film, thanks for reading (I guess)

    I haven't seen this movie in a very long time but quite frankly I remember the WHOLE thing. The film (which uses A lot of quotes as the actors Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes are always speaking like they are saying a poem or whatever)is about two people; Romeo(played by Di Caprio from my all time favourite live action movie Titanic)and Juliet(played by a unrecognizable yet fresh looking Claire Danes from Stardust)who meet at the Gala duo and fall in love. But with Juliet's restricted parents will she ever meet her Romeo again? Bottom line this movie is well OK I guess but my main problem is with all the poetic like quotes that the actors use like I mentioned before,I dunno its like annoying at times,yet Claire and Leo did a tremendous job as the two cross lovers who marry eventually and of course tragedy strikes(yeah and if you want to know what that is well here it is. Spoilers Romeo gets poisoned and Juliet(who cannot live without him)grabs his gun and shoots herself and dies in the church with him. Overall it wasn't my cup of tea and the ending as terrible so i'm giving it a 4/10

    The 1997 version of Romeo and Juliet is a modern take on Shakespeare's original play. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Romeo. The film did a good job of recreating the original play, but to a fault. The acting sometimes goes overboard and makes you laugh when the scene is supposed to be sad. In the original play, the focus is more towards Juliet, as she is the one who struggles with her family, Paris, and Romeo. But in the modern film, the focus is mostly centered around Romeo. This might because the director needed the star power of DiCarprio to carry the film. The film also copies the text word for word, which will often leave you wondering what the actors are saying. Overall the movie was OK. If you are shakepaere fan, then you will enjoy it. Overall, it gets a 5/10.

    Romeo and Juliet is one of Shakespeare's most common plays. The story discusses themes like love, hatred, and society. In Baz Luhrmann's movie of Romeo + Juliet, he was able to completely capture Shakespeare's themes by expressing the story through preserving the play's original language but also adding modern aspects. Some people may believe that the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli 's Romeo and Juliet is a superior story to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, and that Luhrmann's story was just some cheap modern repeat of the same story. But this new take on Romeo and Juliet made was able to make the story more easily understandable by removing the seriousness from the play. It was also able to offer the younger generation an opportunity to comprehend the significance of this story. This movie is definitely recommendable to anyone who can appreciate Shakespeare's stories no matter what artistic form the story is produced in.

    Baz Luhrmann exceeded Shakespeare's expectations for Romeo and Juliet with this film. For example, the cast of actors chosen to portray the characters were perfect for the job. This is shown best in scenes where Romeo (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is in deep bouts of rage. The emotions expressed by the actors add an extra layer of emotion and depth to the script. Additionally, the movie style in itself is a twist on the popular play. Although the setting is modern, Luhrmann used the exact linguistics from the original play. It is possible that he chose to do that so the true meaning of the script wouldn't be lost. The contrast of Shakespearean English to a modern setting allows for the audience to better understand the language using the interactions with the characters as a guide. Even the slight changes Luhrmann made to the original script of the play enhanced the movie. In Act 5 of the play, Juliet was supposed to wake up after Romeo drank the poison; however, in the film Juliet wakes up while Romeo is taking the poison. This action made the scene all the more poignant. Any modifications made for the sake of the film enhanced the emotions and interactions present in the tragedy. All in all, I give two thumbs up.

    Many of you have probably read the original version of Romeo and Juliet, or maybe have even seen the play. How much different was this modern version from the original version? How would Shakespeare react after watching this movie? He wouldn't like it at all. The setting was completely different, and several important scenes from the play were missing. Some of the characters weren't even portrayed correctly. For example, Tybalt never beat up Romeo as it showed in the movie. Also, what is up with the policeman prince? He wasn't really a prince. The characters' overall personalities in this movie were just way too silly. This movie would not meet up to Shakespeare's expectation. He would be highly disappointed in how this movie was made. The fact that the setting was modern but the language was not, just made the movie more awkward. The language should have also been modern to match the overall theme. I do admit though that the romance was very interesting and kept my attention being a girl. Overall, I rate this movie a 2/10.
